15,"We actually know quite a bit about the mosaics that no longer exist thanks to two people, that being Cornelius Loos and Wilhelm Salzenberg.

Loos visited Constantinople around 1710 on behalf of Charles XII of Sweden, trying to maintain ties with the Ottomans during the Great Northern War.

Loos was a military engineer, so he had alot of experience when it came to drawing and mapping out areas. During this time the Hagia Sophia's mosaic still hadn't been covered up, and Loos was able to create detailed views of them using (probably) a Camera Obscura.

If it weren't for Loos, we would not know about the [mosaic vaults in the south gallery](https://www.pallasweb.com/p/southgallery2.jpg), [northern gallery](https://www.pallasweb.com/p/1-2018-loos-north-3.jpg) and [Empress' Lodge](https://www.pallasweb.com/p/1-2018-loos-westgallery2.jpg).

Salzenberg is another invaluable source. He accompanied the Fossatis during their restoration in the 1840's and made many detailed drawings of the mosaics they uncovered.
The most priceless one is probably [this one](https://www.pallasweb.com/p/1-saltzenberg-western.jpg) depictingt he western bema mosaics comissioned by Basil I in the 9th Century, (these are all gone now) aswell as what remained of the [mosaics in the southern gallery](https://www.pallasweb.com/p/1-saltzenberg-1.jpg)",Kingdom of France,/r/europe/comments/f25ex1/hagia_sophia_oc/fhdyhin/,Anthemius_Augustus,1581507687

32,"In scenarios where climate change is as likely as not to stay below 2° and energy demand increases by more than 20% (I here assumed 25% or 25481 TWh), according to the IPCC nuclear capacity ought to be increased by the factor 3,1 (looking at the median of recommendations). 5 is not 3,1 of course. If we look at lower energy demand scenarios, the factor is obviously even smaller. 

Ceterus paribus *just* wind energy capacity must increase by a **factor of 24** and reach 8154 TWh (same share as nuclear energy). 

You can easily look at the data (Full 2014 synthesis report, p.100) and do the calculations for yourself to check up on mine.

This is gonna be my last reply. It’s the same $. Wether you collect it via corporate tax, capital tax or whatever. You can only collect it once, and your politicians get to decide how to collect it. A dollar more via corporate tax means a dollar less via capital tax. More mineral oil taxes means less corporate taxes.

Money doesn’t vanish. Ofc you can minimise dividends by taxing corporations more, but your pension funds rely on those dividends, less dollar there means less payout to pensioners. It’s. The. Same. Dollar.

True liberalized market would exists if all grid-level and external costs were included in price of electricity. This is not a case in EU. Grid-level cost are not included in commodity cost which serves as huge hidden subsidy to intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Waste management of wind/solar is not included either. 

About EPR reactors, why every single anti-nuclear person always only gives example of FOAK costs of probably worst nuclear reactor model on market? Why not give examples of APR-1400 or VVR-1200 reactors, that have proven to be cost competitive and have track-record of being build on time and on budget.

You seem to be unaware that one can be in favour of a certain economic policy and still be familiar with the opposing or different policies other nations espouse. I am in favour of an EU-industrial policy as it is the best way for the EU to try and retain power in the future global economy.

&gt; Well news flash for you. Some of those nations are in the EU, and of course they are not readily giving up on their economic foundation. Especially since those countries are among the most economic prosperous nations in the EU.

Sure, but that prosperity can change and the EU cannot rest on its laurels. Additionally what is good for Denmark may not be good for the EU as a whole. Or would you for example argue that the Irish taxhaven is good for the EU?

164,"That's not my point at all. My point is that in the western, liberalized energy markets, nuclear lost the economic race. It's just not economically viable. No private investor is going to embark on that journey without severe backing from the state. That's why only planned economies and strong authoritarian countries are still building NPPs. 

France is also a great point. They've built the majority of their nuclear power plants during the 70s with strong backing from the state (traditionally, provision of energy in France is considered a public service, via state controlled companies, and with heavy regulation from the state and state ministries. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the liberalization of their energy markets in line with the EU acquis, and only recently in 2018 fully opened their natural gas market, for example). 

Hinkley point? This Hinkley point? 

""According to December 2017 estimates, Hinkley is being built for £20.3bn by 2025, to be paid over a 35 year period.According to Dieter Helm,  professor of Energy Policy at the University of Oxford, ""Hinkley Point C  would have been roughly half the cost if the government had been  borrowing the money to build it at 2%, rather than EDF's cost of  capital, which was 9%."" In September 2019, further costs were identified that bring the estimated total to £22.9bn, and may further delay operations.""

Guess who's financing the project? 

""Financing of the project is still to be finalised, but the construction costs will be paid for by the mainly state-owned [EDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lectricit%C3%A9_de_France) of France and state-owned [CGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_General_Nuclear_Power_Group) of China"". State owned companis, and one of them coming from China, a country with state planned economy.  

That IS NOT an economically viable project. Without state backing it will fail, and even then, it's status is questionable. 

Finland? I suppose you're talking about the Olkiluoto 3 reactor. Started in 2003. Here's the current situation:  

""The construction of this plant is now substantially behind schedule  and over cost. As of 2010, Areva expected to lose €2.3 billion ($3.2  billion) on the project. As of December 2019, the expected start of commercial operation is in March 2021.

According to World Nuclear Association 2008: ”Experience has  shown that each year of additional delay in the construction of a  nuclear power plants adds another estimated $1 billion to the cost”.""",,/r/europe/comments/f297v2/eu_wind_and_solar_generation_overtook_coal_in_2019/fhdtwgx/,jazavchar,1581501427

It should have said ""The Eu trades plenty with other countries outside the **inner market**"" The UK and Ireland are/were never a part of schengen while members of the inner market. They are still under EU law though. Still a big miss from me, only slightly mitigated by the byzantine nature of the topic we're discussing.

I checked the turkish-european agreement, and you're right that a few types of goods are without tariffs, but in those sectors Turkey agreed to follow internal regulations in those sectors. The only agreements I have found are those where Turkey specifically are to allign itself with the EU in prospect of future membership. And it's a pretty bare-bones agreement isolated to a few industries and sectors. I don't think any of these elements in that agreement is something the UK wants.

&gt;&gt; And yes regulations apply domestically for all members of the single market.

&gt;Which is what the UK doesn't want.

More or less yes, but so far they have seen to be more willing to follow regulations than to leave the inner market.

One of the words has to be the overall concept you are describing.
German perspective: the last word in a compound is always the defining word.

Example with ""fire"" (Feuer) and ""fox"" (Fuchs).
Feuerfuchs = a fox that is made of fire or resembles fire.
Fuchsfeuer = a fire made for (or of) foxes.

How to you get ""northern light"" from fire and fox? At that point you could as well invent a new word.
German ""Nordlicht"" on the other hand is clear in its meaning.
Nord = north
Licht = light

323,"Actually many countries have a withholding tax applied regardless of where the private individuals are located.

Some of my dividends are taxed way above 50%, between corporate taxes, withholding taxes and my local taxes. And this is from corporations that have above 90% payout rate. If half of your profit goes into some states coffers I don’t think it’s fair to say they do not pay their fair share.

For example if I get a dividend from the US they withhold 15% of that and then I pay another 10% here at home. If I get a dividend from the UK they withhold 0% and I pay 25% at home. To me there is little advantage to wether a company is in a tax heaven or not. Even if it’s headquartered in a place where they don’t pay corporate taxes that only raises the dividend and thus the tax income in my home country. To my country it’s even advantageous because they get 100% of the capital gains tax even if the business has nothing to do with my country(for example I get dividends from a US REIT). It’s a straight up wealth transfer.

It’s a mixed bag either way. The only losers are countries that have no culture of stock ownership which has the majority of even its own companies held by foreigners, that’s a pure capital drain.

&gt;The EU trades plenty with other countries outside the Schengen area, but in that case it of course includes tariffs. I must admit that I don't actually know if the Schengen was a specific requirement for the EU to allow Switzerland into the inner market, or if this was a mutual agreement, and Switzerland wanted to be part of the Schengen area. The schengen agreement do offer some advantages when it comes to trading, since it naturally makes trading between European nations faster and with less bureaucracy, oversight and border control.

And that's the rub. What UK wants is free trade with no Schengen. I know EU doesn't want that, but it's their petulant insistence wanting to punish the UK, IMHO. 

&gt;Turkey isn't a member of the single market and never was. The only non-eu members part of the inner market so far is Norway and Switzerland. I do not know the specifics of the current EU-Turkish trade-agreement, but tariffs are very much in effect at the moment.

Based on what I've read I know at least some EU-Turkish trade is tariff free due to the agreement. 

&gt;And yes regulations apply domestically for all members of the single market. 

Which is what the UK doesn't want. 

&gt;The point the EU claims to be of the inner market when it comes to trade-deal negotiations is to have a uniform point of reference on what type and quality of goods the nations outside of EU can expect to buy and sell, and the point of restriction of independent trade-deals is the idea that the EU making deals collectively increases it's bargain power as the collective market is bigger and more powerful.

I don't understand this. I fail to see how internal domestic law in the UK would affect EU trading partners in all but the most abstract way. 

And even if it does, who cares? See Turkey. EU is willing to freely trade with them and Turkey doesn't follow EU law. 

I don't know think the EU has a leg to stand on with the claim ""free trade requires Schengen"". 

&gt;My oppinion so far about the UK deal, is that it feels like a very ""non-brexit brexit deal"". They're so far still living under the same regulations as they did before brexit, but have lost their influence in parliament and therefore the ability to have a say in what these regulations are.

That's assuming the agreement requires compliance and that UK will actually comply.

The EU has little enforcement. They UK could simply lie and say they're going to comply and then just ignore EU law. This would put the EU on the back foot.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/evq5bt/brexit_deal_passes_the_european_parliament_621_49/fhdjang/,rtechie1,1581488180

366,"I and my minor children were born as US citizens. I recently got Hungarian citizenship for me and then. Here is why I did so. Note that, while you may not yet have kids, if you do (now or later), then they would also be able to get Italian citizenship through you. 

1) I started with the premise there is no real downside aside from the hassle of some paperwork (and, in the unique case of Hungary, learning the language, which you will not have to do for Italy). Both the US and Hungary allow dual citizenship. The same is true of AUS and Italy. 

2) I would like to spend some extended time in Budapest when my kids get older and I’m closer to retirement. Citizenship eliminates visa issues. 

3) I would also like to live somewhere on Europe during retirement. My Hungarian citizenship also gave me EU citizenship.  Assuming Hungary remains in the EU, I will have the right (along with my wife who is not a Hungarian citizen) to live in other EU countries without needing a visa. 

4) The EU has good, affordable university options compared to the US. I don’t know if my kids will want to study abroad, but having Hungarian and EU citizenship will do nothing except make that path easier for them if they want to pursue it. 

5) If my kids want to live or work in Europe, Hungarian/EU citizenship will make that easier for them. Same thing if they find a European spouse or partner and want to live with them in Europe before getting married. Bottom line is I wanted my kids to have *options* to do these things and live somewhere else should they want to do so. 

6) Especially with the weird political climate in the US, it’s nice to have a foreign passport to GTFO in case things really start going to shit here.

For maintenance costs, [this](https://www.bam.com/en/press/press-releases/2018/5/levvel-reaches-financial-close-on-afsluitdijk-project-successfully) is the best source I could find in a casual search. If Afsluitdijik costs €550 million per 25 years for 32 km of dam, you can roughly scale up and say a dam 20 times as long will cost €500 million per year in maintenance costs. 

A couple sites quote €1.25 billion for coastal flooding in Europe right now. [But they could be more like 12.5-40 billion in 2050.](https://www.climatechangepost.com/europe/coastal-floods/) Let’s day roughly 50% of these damages will happen in the countries affect by dam. Honestly, 2050 is probably a decent estimate for the earliest this dam could be finished, so I’m going to call it €6-20 billion potential savings per year starting when the dam is built. 

I’m going to go with the higher estimate elsewhere in this thread for cost of construction (because when does a project of this size ever come in under budget?) and say €500 billion. So if you take build cost divided by the sum of the 2050 yearly damages and the yearly maintenance cost, you get anywhere between a 25 and a 76 year payback. After that amount of time your would start making money assuming sea levels stopped rising in 2050. 

Of course, there’s no reason to think the sea level rise would stop in 2050, so with that information the payback time is probably closer to the 25 year mark.

592,"""As a result of mental problems in Poland, children are dying. What else must happen that we will be taken seriously?"" - asks at [OKO.press](https://OKO.press) prof. Barbara Remberk, head of the Warsaw child and youth psychiatry clinic

&amp;#x200B;

The echoes of Janusz Schwertner's famous reportage in Onet, titled ""Love in times of plague."" Wiktor, a transgender fourteen-year-old, committed suicide in the spring of 2019. Just three weeks before Milo, a transgender person whose story we described:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also read:

""I'm sick of being treated like shit."" On May 6, transgender Milo committed suicide

MAY 23, 2019

&amp;#x200B;

Wiktor was mocked at school. He met with homophobia and transphobia. Like Kacper, his friend met in the children's psychiatry ward in Józefów, where both were hospitalized. The author of the article describes the terrible conditions in the ward - dirty bedding, bars sticking out of the beds - as well as the unprepared staff to work with LGBT youth. Hospital staff and specialists working outside hospitals accuse unnecessary ""stuffing"" of drugs and homophobia. The report sheds light on the lack of access to psychiatric care for young Poles. On the other hand, the text has vivid descriptive descriptions, including self-harm scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

[OKO.press](https://OKO.press) talks with prof. Barbara Remberk, national consultant on child and youth psychiatry, head of the Child and Youth Psychiatry Clinic at the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, which includes the Child and Youth Psychiatry Department.

&amp;#x200B;

Anton Ambroziak, Hanna Szukalska [OKO.press](https://OKO.press): What did you think when you read Janusz Schwertner's report on Onet?

&amp;#x200B;

Professor Barbara Remberk: Teenage suicide is always a tragedy. This is an unimaginable misfortune for parents and relatives, but also usually an expression of system failure. However, not all information in the text is substantively presented, in particular regarding the principles of treatment and the functioning of wards.

&amp;#x200B;

The macabre picture of the hospital in Józefów emerged from the text: bloody bedding from previous patients, bars sticking out of hospital beds that can be used for self-aggressive behavior ...

&amp;#x200B;

What can I say, from what I know in every hospital bedding changes between patient and patient, I can not imagine a different situation. I am sure that the staff of the Józefów branch also know these standards.

&amp;#x200B;

So the material does not reflect the situation in the departments?

&amp;#x200B;

We have to say straight ahead, the reality of child psychiatry in Poland is dramatically difficult. In my opinion, there are extra beds in every children's hospital in Poland.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a shortage of places in existing hospitals, a shortage of staff, and a lack of departments on a national scale.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also acts of vandalism consisting of painting walls, devastation of objects.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody was indignant when specialists and media alerted that the state spends only 1% on child psychiatry. health budget. And now?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't refer to this particular situation, but I do know that

&amp;#x200B;

it is impossible to add patients above the efficiency of the ward and staff indefinitely, because then the patient's safety is simply less.

&amp;#x200B;

And so it happened in Józefów.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, the medical team, which I think this article refers to, decided that they were unable to continue working in such dramatic staffing conditions and stopped working \[in 2018 - ed.\]. From 2019, the department was resuscitated by Dr. Lidia Popek.

&amp;#x200B;

What does the work at the ward at the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw (IPiN) look like today?

&amp;#x200B;

In the morning we had 38 patients in 28 places. These are only patients who are in a life-threatening condition, because there is not enough places for anyone else. It's about suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, suicide threat.

&amp;#x200B;

So you have to make dramatic decisions every day, who to accept and who to send back?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, we are not able to accept young people with even big problems if they are not in a state of immediate danger, because often there are not enough places for people in suicide crises.

&amp;#x200B;

We have to make an appointment with the hospital two provinces further that we will pass the patient because we will not be able to accommodate him in the ward.

&amp;#x200B;

Are children from distant places also treated at IPiN?

&amp;#x200B;

Each patient has the right to choose the ward in which he wants to be treated, so it happens that patients come to us, despite the fact that other wards are closer. Patients from the Podlasie Voivodship, where there is no ward, have no choice.

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth saying that without extra beds we are able to treat patients almost exclusively on holidays, when according to seasonality in psychiatry \[in summer there are usually fewer hospital admissions - ed.\] The needs are much smaller. The Institute, as a scientific institution, is in a fairly happy staffing situation. We work with people who specialize and train, and this slightly increases the number of staff.

&amp;#x200B;

However, we are not able to work non-stop at the highest turnover",,/r/europe/comments/f2ju8g/dont_panic_seek_therapy_despite_the_drama_in/fhd02kq/,AdministrativePilot3,1581474469
593,"And this is required of us.

&amp;#x200B;

What should parents do when their children are sent away?

&amp;#x200B;

We encourage you to submit a referral and queue for the ward. Today, the waiting time for planned hospitalization is several months. While we are waiting, we can only suggest that parents find the best possible psychiatric care: regular visits to the doctor, psychotherapy and family consultations.

&amp;#x200B;

For which you also have to wait. Are your parents using services on the private market?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, although they are also waiting in line. For a psychiatrist, sometimes two months. And after all, childcare is not control visits from time to time, but meetings week after week. Their cost is huge. Correctly conducted treatment is regular psychiatric consultations, psychotherapy once a week, family consultations once a month. Added to this is the cost of diagnostics, medicines ...

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Why does the psychiatric community criticize Janusz Schwertner's text?

&amp;#x200B;

I am amazed at the author's statements about medicines, especially since no expert is cited in the text, e.g. in the field of pharmacology.

&amp;#x200B;

The author writes about ""stuffing"" Ketrel and Seronil, which are supposed to be inappropriate for children and patients in general who have not been diagnosed with depression.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

See the statement of the Polish Psychiatric Association on pharmacology

Fragments of text about medicines refer to the content of the leaflet or the summary of product characteristics. The leaflet and summary of product characteristics is the text prepared by the drug manufacturer based on the registration tests required by law. It contains valuable information, but medical knowledge is broader and more complex than a collection of messages prepared by pharmaceutical companies. There are also no doubts about the indications.

&amp;#x200B;

Although they are called antidepressants, we use them in various clinical situations, e.g. in the treatment of anxiety. Like antipsychotics, we use not only psychoses. The description of the leaflet is different and medical recommendations regarding the rules of conduct are different.

&amp;#x200B;

After the publication of the article, a strong answer was given by the voivodship national consultant, head of the Józefów children's department since 2019, who writes that the material is unethical because it caused anxiety related to psychiatric treatment and reporting to hospitals. ""An increase in anxiety in children and adolescents and their families may result in postponing specialist consultations, which is already happening now, not only because of staff shortages, but also because of the difficult decision for parents, which is the child's psychiatric consultation. Unfortunately, time in this case most often exacerbates situations related to deterioration of children's mental functioning. The text of the article certainly increases this fear, anxiety of future patients and their families ""- writes Dr. Lidia Popek.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually,

&amp;#x200B;

since the publication of the text we have been receiving calls from panicked parents who say that Józefów will definitely not send children.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, we inform them that their anxiety is not justified.

&amp;#x200B;

The article is also underdeveloped from the point of view of suicide prevention. The author describes the manner of suicide too accurately, which may increase the risk of imitators. We always observe more suicide attempts after a high profile media case of suicide or attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

The so-called Werter effect, because after the publication of Goethe's work a wave of suicides passed through Europe. But the article did something good too.

&amp;#x200B;

It definitely touches on stigmatization and rejection in a peer environment. The author associated them with the issue of sexual health, we also have similar patients. In general, the topic of peer relationships and persecution is crucial. We used to do a short survey in the ward and two-thirds of our patients reported being bullied by their peers. On the one hand, psychiatry is a field of medicine, psychological and therapeutic treatment of mental disorders, but the environment also affects the mental condition of patients. The mental health of patients also depends on how their society is treated.

&amp;#x200B;

What difficulties most often strain the mental health of young people?

&amp;#x200B;

School-related stress is extremely important. There are, of course, family difficulties: violence, illness, poverty, lack of parental care.

&amp;#x200B;

The stories of Wiktor and Kacper show what children who deviate from the norm face. Especially today, when a lot is said about LGBT people, it is increasingly hostile. In your work, do you observe that it is even more difficult for young non-heteronormative and transgender people than before?

&amp;#x200B;

There are certainly more and more such people in our department. I don't know if this means that it is generally more difficult for them, but certainly more of them seek help. On the one hand, there are elements of hate speech in the public debate, which certainly does not help. On the other hand, I have the impression young people are much more open to otherness and to themselves",,/r/europe/comments/f2ju8g/dont_panic_seek_therapy_despite_the_drama_in/fhd04mx/,AdministrativePilot3,1581474502
594,"\- a growing number of young people who are suffering from a mental health crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

That's what specialists around the world say. If we are to be precise, it is worth saying that in Poland we do not have research in which we are able to accurately show: it was, and it is so.

&amp;#x200B;

However, we know that the number of suicide attempts is steadily increasing - there were 348 in 2013, and as many as 746 in 2018, of which 26 are children aged 7-12. 92 people were killed. A year earlier, in 2017, up to 115.

&amp;#x200B;

Most suicide attempts are not reported to the police at all. It is considered that

&amp;#x200B;

in children and adolescents per suicide committed, there are 20 to 100 suicide attempts. We don't hear about most of them. Our patients tell us that they had previously attempted suicide, but before they came to us, no one knew about it.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the fact that we have many more children in suicide crises, the profile of patients is also changing. Many of them need sudden, not necessarily long intervention.

&amp;#x200B;

And the lower age of patients? We have heard that even three-year-olds have thoughts of suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

It is terrifying, but indeed the age limit is shifting to the beginning of primary school. There are early self-harm and suicide attempts.

&amp;#x200B;

One is the system and the other is the staff.

&amp;#x200B;

In the whole complicated system, it is easiest to count psychiatrists and say that there are too few. But there are also a lack of psychologists and psychotherapists. We can convince ourselves that they are not enough, waiting for the waiting time for psychological consultation.

&amp;#x200B;

There is talk of a specialist outflow to the private sector.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor is still there, but the psychologist really earns a penny. Each center has its own remuneration policy. Our psychologist earns a little more than a young teacher, but the same as a cashier in ""Biedronka"". On hand less than 2,000 zlotys.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever lost an experienced psychologist?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I even understand such decisions. When a person has a diploma, he has specialized and after a few years of practice earns pennies, he begins to wonder what is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Leaving experienced employees is always a huge loss not only for the facility and patients, but for the entire sector. With them, we lose valuable knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, a child psychiatrist has been on the list of priority specializations. Did you notice an improvement?

&amp;#x200B;

Our specialization has been on this list for several years, but since there are few branches, there are no places for specialization.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

What do you need to make work in the ward easier?

&amp;#x200B;

One more branch in Warsaw, that's for sure. Better financing, because all 24-hour branches in Poland have debts. The amounts we get for treating patients are not enough. The more patients who take the ward, the more debts they have. It's a vicious circle. And in the sphere of dreams? It's hard to think.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you advise people who are in a panic today and do not know where to look for help?

&amp;#x200B;

The situation described in this article is tragic, but the fact that in the case of this particular person treatment turned out to be ineffective, it does not mean that it is ineffective at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Properly conducted psychiatric treatment is really effective. Correct, i.e. not only drugs, but also psychotherapy, cooperation with school, family cooperation.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes parents say that they did not enroll their child in a counseling center because they wait half a year, after which they come to the emergency room six months later. The basic form of support is the use of psychological and medical assistance. Even in our system full of shortages, we need to seek this help.

&amp;#x200B;

Swallow inconvenience, queues, crush?

&amp;#x200B;

As if the patients were lying on the ICU under five drips, they would not wonder if they were comfortable or not, because saving their priority is a priority. Our system is imperfect, but we also save lives, psychiatric departments save lives and comfort must be pushed to the background.

&amp;#x200B;

Our situation is today: children are dying as a result of mental problems in Poland. This is our problem and we must fight it.

&amp;#x200B;

But for anyone to be interested in this seriously, we need journalistic shock therapy, a revolution?

&amp;#x200B;

The only way out is evolution. We don't have anyone to make a revolution with. We will go away from the beds and what? Who will come to do it for us? The staff is poor, but they still are.

The Murcia professor who on Monday offered a talk about Art History without fulfilling the new obligation to ask the parents for permission does not stop attending the media. Chain an interview with another. Everyone wants to know why Diego Reina ""**explicitly refused"" to ask for the controversial parental pin.**

&amp;#x200B;

Students in a classroom of the Community

First Murcia professor who refuses to ask permission from parents to organize a talk at the institute

""**I declare myself a conscientious objector. I have disobeyed because I consider that the parental veto is illegal and immoral**, and there is even a **requirement from the Government of Spain to withdraw this measure**. I assume that I have breached an order,"" he says to the telephone from the IES Alfonso X The Sage of Murcia, where he says that this morning everything has been kisses, hugs and applause: ""My face hurts kisses and hugs.""

&amp;#x200B;

Reina, in the same vein as the educational community and the unions, argues that the parental pin imposed by Vox to approve the Murcia Budget addresses a ""non-existent problem"": ""During the 24 years that the PP has ruled alone nobody has asked for it "", it states.

&amp;#x200B;

This teacher thinks that ""**the parental pin is like saying that teachers are bad and my children are dumb.**"" Reina proposed to hold the talk directly to her students, who attended it in its entirety, according to this teacher. The complementary activity was taught by Pedro Alberto Ruiz, university professor and former Minister of Culture in Murcia between 2008 and 2014, under the mandate of the popular Ramón Luis Valcárcel.

&amp;#x200B;

**""The idea was given to me by a student""**

""The idea was given to me by a student telling me that **politicians think we are dumb.** Fools are not, nobody becomes homosexual because they talk about homosexuality. Students discriminate against information **and have much more criteria than we think**,"" he defends. Queen.

Murcia lowers the parental pin and allows talks of officials in schools without parental permission

The teacher says that he expects the visit of the inspector ""in a few days"" and assumes that he will open the corresponding information file, but discards that he will be penalized for this talk without a parental pin. His sanction, he says, can be ""a day without salary"", although he is confident that he will not be sanctioned ""because it is something mediatic and would be a scandal."" ""All I have done is organize a talk,"" he adds.

&amp;#x200B;

Asked if the center's management team knew their intentions, Reina replies that her department ""assumed that I was going to comply with the law"", although this Tuesday ""**no classmate has recriminated me or received any reprimand from the center's management**"" .

&amp;#x200B;

Find a teacher in favor of the parental pin, ""a miracle""

""I meet dozens of classmates who tell me they feel shame and disappointment. Finding a teacher in favor has to be almost a miracle**, even from the PP, who have confessed to me that they feel shame**.""

&amp;#x200B;

Reina remembers that last December there were several soldiers to explain to the students how the Army works. An activity that he did not organize and for which the center requested parental leave. ""I went down the hall and met three students outside the class who had not been able to enter because they had forgotten to bring the parental pin - the absence of the permit is equivalent to the denial of it. - Those three students missed the activity.

692,"The EU is planning to ban all sale of new combustion vehicles in 2030. Which means every new car sold will probably have a 40-100 kWh battery by then, which will have to be durable, safe, lightweight, and manufactured at scale.

Compare that with a much smaller 13.5 kWh Tesla Powerwall home battery, which is already total overkill for demand shifting for most households.

As prices naturally become more volatile, battery storage will make financial sense for more and more users. You can also have utility providers participating in this, via the creation of ""virtual powerplants"" like the one they rolled out in Australia where the utility provider can tap into people's home batteries when required to support the grid.

Overall the changes seem fairly minor, except that natural gas peaker plants which people thought would be needed to support the transition to renewables are rapidly turning into stranded assets. Things can suddenly change much faster once people see which way the economic winds are blowing.

Batteries aren't there yet for really cheap bulk storage, but they are rapidly moving in the right direction. I don't think the amount needed for remaining industrial uses will be that strange compared to what we will already need for transportation.

Greenhouse effect has very little to do with the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, it is related but CO2 alone doesn't mean much in terms of temperature increase.

&gt;Also discussed during their meeting was the migrant/refugee issue, as both countries are entry points into Europe, with the Greek Minister also briefing Laya about Turkey’s illegal memoranda signed with the Tripoli government which also undermines peace in the Arab country.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Spain and Greece are able to help” in a ceasefire in Libya, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Greek Minister’s full statement during the joint press conference:  
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to express my thanks for the invitation, the hospitality, and for the very constructive talks I had today with my Spanish colleague, Arancha González Laya.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding our bilateral relations, we jointly ascertained that they are at an excellent level, both politically and economically, with our countries collaborating on a large range of issues. We agreed to boost our economic relations, in order to increase private investments on both sides, as well as our bilateral cooperation.  
&gt;  
&gt;We talked about the refugee/migration issue, as both countries are points of entry and first reception for refugees and migrants. We agreed to expand our coordination in the context of the European Union, during the debate on reform of the Union’s rules on asylum and on migration in general.  
&gt;  
&gt;I briefed my colleague on the serious impact of Turkey’s violations of international legality on stability, security and peace in the Mediterranean, which, as Mediterranean countries, is our common homeland.  
&gt;  
&gt;I stressed that the Law of the Sea is conditio sine qua non for peace and stability. I reiterated that the two Turkey-Libya memoranda – though null and void, as they violate the International Law of the Sea and the UN Security Council Resolution on the Libya arms embargo – undermine precisely that good which is precious to all of us: peace and stability. At the same time, they threaten the efforts for the ceasefire in Libya. Both Spain and Greece are in a position to assist these efforts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, we had the opportunity to discuss the Western Balkans and their accession perspective. For Greece, this perspective is the only way forward. It is vital to the region’s stability and prosperity. We believe that the European Commission’s recent proposal for reform of the accession process should move ahead without further delay. But at the same time, I made it very clear that both countries’ perspectives have to do with their own compliance with the conditionalities that are requisite for their European course.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, we looked in depth at regional initiatives, such as MED7. MED7 can assist with bolstering stability and peace in the region.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to thank my dear colleague for the warm welcome, which I am certain I will have the opportunity to reciprocate very soon in Athens.",,/r/europe/comments/f2duto/greece_and_spain_meet_over_bilateral_issues_and/fhbvhqq/,IASIPxIASIP,1581450748

That's what I'm saying, yes. That would still be preferable compared to using gas a substantial amount of the time.

1040,"&gt;Also, while nuclear energy is unquestionably more preferable than coal or lignite for obvious reasons (immediate pollution and less profit after 20 years), in reality nuclear waste is far worse. We only know how to contain it and our only solution is to store it (keep it hidden). Nuclear reactors usually use uranium and plutonium isotopes. Do you know how long do they need to break down? 4.5 BILLION and 24 K years respectively. Earth may not last that long.

Spoken like you only read the wikipedia article. From nuclear waste only a very small portion stays radioactive for a long time . HLW (high level waste) accounts for 0.2% of all nuclear waste in France. Low-level waste accounts for 59.6% of waste and stays radioactive for at most 300 years (most if it stays for less). And 31.3% of waste is Very low level waste which stays radioactive anywhere from 100 days to a few decades at most. 

So no, high level waste which entire france generates that would stay radioactive for long (and, no, billions of years, but fair enough several thousand) could not fill up an olympic swimming pool right now. And they've been using it for 50 years and more.

&gt; Firstly, N26 knew the Brexit was coming. It launched in Britain in October 2018, over two years after the Brexit vote and 6 months before the UK was originally scheduled to leave the EU.

&gt; Moreover, data compiled by Sifted in December suggested N26 was struggling to catch up in the UK, after its successful debut in Germany.

However, if entry level jobs are so poorly paid that collecting unemployment is preferable, then of course you can't expect people to work for less income. Decent minimum wages and job stability are needed, not bullshit like 0 hour contracts or 1€/h jobs.

Additionally, the more you police the unemployed and threaten them with cuts if they don't comply with your strict rules, the less leeway they get in seeking their job and the less likely they are to secure long-term employment.

When people go to Germany they find jobs near instantly if they know a bit German. Here you can send 400 letters to 400 employment requests and receive a few back saying no, we'll contact you and 90% not even bothering to reply. 

The major reason the vast majorly of young people hasn't moved out is their social circle and the fear of change. 

For example someone that has programed for 5~10 years in my city earns about 1000€~1300€ a month after taxes and all of that. This is considered ""a really good wage"" there also no bonuses and no profit shares or any other income streams. 

Now consider this the same developer in Germany earns a minimum of 3250€ after taxes in Germany. This is like a real minimum. He realistically has from 39k€ to 63k€ a year. So 3250€~5250€ plus bonuses, stocks and other options. 

Now consider this.

Rent is about 70% higher in a similar sized city in Germany.
Groceries, Textiles and so on are are actually cheaper.
Electronics are also cheaper.
Cars are cheaper.

Restaurants, bars, taxis, local transporation is all more expensive.

So if you own a apartment/house in Croatia, you're just paying utilities, you're working an IT job. You are literally making 60~70% less money left over after paying everything compared to a German IT guy.

a) 1913 Treaty of London : The future of the Eastern Aegean Islands have been left to the decision of Six Powers in Article 5 of the Treaty of London.
b) 1914 Decision of Six Powers: The islands of Lemnos, Samothrace, Lesvos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria and others under Greek occupation as of 1914 were ceded to Greece by the 1914 Decision of Six Powers (Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary) on the condition that they should be kept demilitarized.
c) 1923 Lausanne Peace Treaty: In Article 12 of the Lausanne Peace Treaty the 1914 Decision of Six Powers was confirmed.
Article 13 of the Laussane Treaty stipulated the modalities of the demilitarization for the islands of Lesvos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria. It imposed certain restrictions related to the presence of military forces and establishment of fortifications which Greece undertook as a contractual obligation to observe stemming from this Treaty.
The Convention of the Turkish Straits annexed to the Laussanne Treaty further defined the demilitarized status of the islands of Lemnos and Samothrace. It stipulated a stricter regime for these islands, due to their vital importance to the security of Turkey by virtue of their close proximity to the Turkish Straits.
d) 1936 Montreux Convention: The Montreux Convention did not bring any change to the demilitarized status of these Islands. With the Protocol annexed to the said Convention, the demilitarized status of the Turkish Straits has been lifted to ensure the security of Turkey. In the Montreux Convention there is no clause regarding the militarization of the islands of Lemnos and Samothrace.
e) 1947 Paris Peace Treaty: The demilitarized status of Eastern Aegean Islands was once again confirmed in 1947 long after the Lausanne Treaty. The ""Dodecanese Islands"" namely Stampalia, Rhodes, Calki, Scarpanto, Casos, Piscopis, Nisiros, Calimnos, Leros, Patmos, Lipsos, Symi, Cos and Castellorizo were ceded to Greece on the explicit condition that they must remain demilitarized (Annex 6).",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/f1x1ck/greece_has_obligation_to_defend_islands_against/fhaoy68/,kokturk,1581421549

Nowadays ""drac"" usually means in Romanian a critter from Hell, a deamon or a devil.

The Romanian folktales use mostly the word ""balaur"", which is usually a serpent like critter with wings and often several heads, basically a hydra. The word could be related to an Albanian or Serbian word.

In Romanian there is also the word ""zmeu"" - a slavic word as you can see on the map in dark purple - but which usually in folktales means an very strong super-powered human-like  evil person.

Firstly, the EU and US must exert influence on China to reform its practices, and they must not give China market access preemptively.  I am against the way the Trump administration views tariffs and international trade, but I support generally the need to crack down on unfair trade practices.  Secondly, the EU and US absolutely must ensure cohesiveness in Southeast Asia.  Asean is in the process of building a single market.  If it successfully completed it and graduates with a customs union to a full fledged economic union, Southeast Asia will be able to protect its states from aggressive Chinese practices much more effectively.

1559,"&gt;Tito, in fact, behaved as Communists do, promoting revolution by the mass liquidation of potential opponents, by subverting every independent institution, and by bringing all power within the Party’s control. He authorised the killing of tens of thousands of people, many without trial, others with staged trials — soldiers, conscripted Home Guard members, unpolitical civilians, Catholic priests, monks and nuns, doctors, nurses, teachers, journalists, businessmen, women and children. The mass graves, where people were thrown in alive to be slowly suffocated by the weight of those who followed, are still gradually being excavated. For fear of annoying influential Communist cadres, who had joined anti-Communists to create the fledgling Croatian state in 1991, these horrible crimes were for many years left unmentioned. Until recently, most Party and secret police archives were similarly inaccessible. There was no lustration of Party members. Not a single trial within Croatia has been held of a Communist official: only in Munich, after Germany managed to secure their extradition, were two high-ranking Yugoslav secret police officials given life sentences for a politically authorised murder on German soil in 1983.

Their religion. Their religion taught them to hate the gays. Which makes it a religion of hate, at least as far as she's concerned.

And it's not just to hate them, but to put them to death.

And the same thing is in the holy books of jews and christians, too. Because it's based on the same holy book. All 3 religions have the same root.

It's kind of a flawed system if one looks at it that way, as it incentivizes ""tactical"" voting over actually representing the electorate... As proven by the candidate of a 5% party almost replacing a former MP with 67% approval rating.

My advice for the CDU would be to do some soul-searching. Ideally, they'd split into two parties, one of them cooperating with Die Linke, and the other with the AfD.

1693,"&gt;The thing that's varying here is not Muslims, but the systems that integrate them. To some extent, Europeans lack the same history of immigration as North Americans in this regard

Sorry, full stop there. The difference is exactly muslims. To think that muslims in NA and Europe are the same is ridiculous.

North America very much pays close attention to who they let into their countries, even regarding refugees. The US and Canada only take a certain number of refugees and of the applicants only those that they see benefitting them. Let's not pretend that any and every muslim can just easily get there. Europe, for reasons of geographical proximity and colonial history, has a considerably bigger amount of uneducated, working class muslims who live amongst their own, similarly to China Towns. A lot of people also just come here, specifically because of our generous welfare systems and freedom, not because they adore our culture and want to integrate. Back in 2015/16 a lot of refugees were sent to Portugal. Portugal has a birth rate of 1.3, the lowest in the EU (afaik). Yet, the refugees that were sent there, left again (for Sweden/Germany/Austria) specifically because you get less financial support there.

&gt; there is a tendency not to force people to choose between identities but  rather to emphasize multiculturalism. Often immigrants are among the  most patriotic Canadians. 

There are very patriotic muslims in Europe and at least for the ones in Germany, I would say that they are well liked. But they are a minority. They identify with the region they grew up in, speak a local variety of German and most of the time practice their religion very liberally, if at all.

The problem is that even they are heavily attacked by other ""conservative"" muslims. I can think of two known German muslims that are under 24/7 police surveillance because their lives are constantly in danger. Because foreign(!) imams called upon muslims to kill them.

There's also a big counter culture among muslims. In Germany, Germans are often insulted for being German or when someone is ""too German"", so people who want to integrate and do so are stigmatized for doing so. According to those people, they should stay true to their heritage. That is thankfully mostly a thing amongst teens but that still interferes with their integration and their contact with local Germans.

Another point is the fact that we have areas in Germany that are so extremely populated by foreigner, that it is impossible to ""integrate"" anyone. I recently read an article about a school in the Ruhr area, where almost all children have a foreign background, most of those a muslim one (arab/turkish) while few others are polish/albanian/serbian/etc. How would it be possible for any integration to take place? In Germany half of all children starting school nowadays have a migratory background and that is obviously not distributed equally.",,/r/europe/comments/f1uha0/french_teen_who_criticised_islam_to_move_schools/fha2ujy/,-Alneon-,1581395697

Firstly, the Muslims in NA are largely legal immigrants who came here through family or for a highly skilled job.  There are also many heavily vetted refugees.  All these people want to live in the US or Canada, they made an affirmative effort to be here.  The children born to them take part in mainstream culture,  even if religious, and are very successful and have higher education/income than the majority.

A large number of European Muslims today are 2nd or 3rd generation to live in Europe, and we're imported en masse from former colonies for cheap labor.  The host countries never intended for these folks to stay.  Turks in Germany are still called auslander for example.  Many of these folks feel unwelcome.  They can't even wear religious headgear in certain places.  I know very intelligent colle graduate Turkish and Algerians in France who are treated like shit.  I'm not putting all this on Muslims.

But that is European society, it's not the US or Canada, and it was beyond foolish to think this was going to work out well.  And the blindly letting in migrants (who commit far less violence than 2nd gen Muslims) has really inflamed things and fueled the rise of the right.

1803,"&gt;Germany is currently building some short-term storage facilities to stabilize the power grid.

No it's not. If you're talking about pumped hydro-storage it's not really short term storage facilities and it is not a viable form of storage. It heavily depends on location and geography, and Germany does not even have the theoretical capacity of it to successfully power itself. they would need entire capacity from Norway too.

More to the point EU ESTORAGE is only proposed. Nothing is sure.

&gt;For long-term storage to be profitable, the coal-fired power plants would have to be throttled and there would often have to be excess electricity.

Uhm no ? Germany would profit heavily from being able to store renewable energy and sell it when others are lacking, because currently renewable energy has priority in consumption.   If they could sell it when others are lacking they're rake in more cash than a.. anything I can think of.

It would be extremely profitable if they did it. They can't. That's the issue.

&gt;Of course, Power2Gas has efficiency problems. But look at the efficiency of lignite? This only works with subsidies, too.

It's way cheaper than converting things to gas and to electricity again. It's not even comparable. And we're not talking lignite here we're talking natural gas.

No longer are we to take interest in this story through a communal shared British history but instead fragment off into the land of ""gay history"".

No longer is an astonishing black hole discovery an intrigue for its scientific value or the talents of the people who found it but instead for the sex of a scientist.

I am just sick of it, it's so regressive and leads to ever more fragmentation and division. It makes no pathways for an integrated sense of society, just isolated tribes caring about their own things.

This kind of journal should be interesting because it fits into our understanding of the development of 18th century attitudes towards homosexuality, primarily in the British context.

1981,"The issue of a fixed link between Ireland and Britain has been discussed a number of times, see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_British_Isles_fixed_sea_link_connections) for details. Traffic-wise, a tunnel between the southern part of Ireland and Wales (\~100 Km) or Dublin and Holyhead would make more sense as it would lead directly into the more populated areas of the UK. The British North-South transport infrastructure is already over capacity, even with HS2 completed, there is much more unused capacity on infrastructure between England and Wales than between even just northern and southern England.

While the economic basis for a fixed link between the Irish Island and Britain would not be that large in any variant, its economic viability stands or falls with beeing useable for freight transport to and from the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland has a GDP of 43 Billion Euro, The Republic of Ireland has a GDP of 382 billion Euro, which may be inflated due to its tax modell. For a comparison of real economic activity, the values for the year 2000 are 100 billion Euro in the Republic of Ireland and 30 billion Euro in Northern Ireland. A link between Scotland and Northern Ireland would not be economically feasible, as freight traffic would likely only be 1/3 of that of the two southern variants.

The people who will have to make the feasibility studies might be very well aware of this. But there is only one problem: The UK decided to leave all the treaties that would have made using the Republic of Ireland for transit an easy option.",,/r/europe/comments/f1v253/work_under_way_into_scotlandnorthern_ireland/fh91fgl/,lteh,1581371712

While the one thing they don't lack is animosity for each other

Their alarming population rise together with global warming will just mean more problems, more famine, more fighting, more death.

Maybe it's me who is pessimistic, but at 32, I don't expect any kind of cohesive African Union to emerge in my lifetime.

&gt; You can work around WIP standards by properly preparing your design

Not for 5G. 3G to LTE, sure, the change in the standard was a couple of new protocols on top of the existing ones. But 5G is a much larger change. You're throwing away all the efficient low footprint protocols in place for heavier ones like http2. Functions of communicating entities in the core have changed a lot, they'll use http2. Critical signal flows for failure handling and key architecture guidelines for TLS/PKI were left as 'WIP' until recently. On top of that, add the lack of support from 3PPs for http2.

In conclusion, every single player in the core network business is handicapped by the slow-moving 3GPP standardization committee and lack of 3rd party support for newer protocols.

English Romanichal Gypsies are of Romani descendent, with Welsh Kale Gypsies and Scottish Lowland Gypsies being of Romanichal descendent. British Gypsies are white in appearance due to mixed marriages with Gaelic Travellers, Funfair Travellers and even non-Travellers over the centuries.

Northern and Southern Romanichal Gypsies speak different dialects of Angloromani, so I coloured them different shades of red. Anglormani is a mix of English and Romani. There are Northern Romanichal in the Scottish Borders (Known locally as Border Gypsies) as well as in Northeast Wales, and there are Southern Romanichal in Southeast Wales.

Today Welsh Kale mostly live deep in rural Western Wales in the Welsh speaking parts. Welsh Kale speak the purest form of Romani amongst British Romani groups, although it’s still not as pure as mainland European Roma languages/dialects.

Scottish Lowland Gypsies live almost exclusively in the Scottish Lowlands. They speak a blend of Romani and Scots called Scottish Cant.

There’s also Funfair Travellers (Showman) who have native heritage. British Funfair Travellers and Irish Funfair Travellers are distinct.

Also there are lots of immigrant Roma Gypsies from Eastern Europe in the UK, places like Glasgow, Belfast, Sheffield and London have large communities.

As a side note, the french revolution has frequently been represented as a dragon/monster, especially by people living in a time where it was normal to live under an absolute monarch (cf Germany, AH, Russia, Spain, etc...) it was seen as breaking the old order.

2225,"&gt;As in many animals, honey bees rely on their gut microbial community for a variety of functions, including food processing (25, 26), regulation of immune system (33, 34), and defense against pathogens (17, 27). Perturbations of this system have the potential to lead to negative consequences for host fitness. We found that glyphosate affects the bee gut microbiota composition and that bacterial species and strains within this community vary in susceptibility to glyphosate. Recent experimental and observational studies have provided evidence that dysbiosis affecting the bee gut can increase susceptibility to pathogen invasion (23, 41, 42). Our results also suggest that establishment of a normal microbial community is crucial for protection against opportunistic pathogens of honey bees. Furthermore, our results highlight one potential mechanism by which glyphosate affects bee health.

This is still the base of the current motorways.

*""That donkey who keeps himself close to the edge, it will come back with the stick or it will fall in the ravine. ""*

*""The trouble seeking priest hit the water and thinks he's happy and full of glory, what a fool! Hit!... Hit!... (The guy in Ireland is hitting water in a mortar appearently)""*

My guess is this means he sees the catholic church in Ireland as being ineffectual (easy to disagree with this one, the catholic church had Ireland firmly in it's grasp) because mashing water in a mortar and pestle can only be used to illustrate a pointless task.


Two things to add for England, 1. the guy on the right is sucking the bones of India, probably accurate. 2. The Alabama is going to America to help the confederates in the civil war.

When people focus on the horrors of mean words, men's way of sitting and relaxing etc. they really know nothing about hardships. And when you're constantly told that tiny (or even non-) issues are big topics that need to be addressed then you're bound to find things to be sad or angry about absolutely everywhere, you're actively searching for things to make you miserable at that point.

It's what we in Denmark refer to as curling parents, or curling culture. Where parents ""sweep"" every problem away for the children so they never have to handle or fix any problem themselves. They're taught to expert perfection everywhere, that they should never ""settle"" or compromise etc. It's no wonder that relationships don't last with such a mentality, if people think that ""boomers"" and older generations were always happy with their spouses, that they never argued, that they never disagreed etc. they're delusional, it's just that they were taught how to deal with issues, arguments, disagreements etc. back then.

Today we're allowing a generation to control speech, to ban things based on personal taste or ""icky-factor"" etc. so if they ever run into a problem in a relationship, in a friendship, in a job, in an education or whatever, they have absolutely no idea how to deal with it, if the opposing side doesn't just back down immediately and give them what they want.

2360,"&gt; In my opinion, the other countries do not get ""discounts""

Germany, Sweden and Holland (Netherlands) get a lot of discount.

-The cost of the UK rebate is divided among EU member countries in proportion to the share they contribute to the EU's GNI. However, since 2002 this has been limited to 25% of their normal financing share for Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.

- For the period 2014-2020 only, reduced VAT call rates for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden are fixed at 0.15% (normal call rate is 0.30%).

Denmark get one discount together with Netherlands, Sweden (and Austria).
-For the period 2014-2020 only, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden benefit from gross reductions in their annual GNI contribution of EUR 130 million, EUR 695 million and EUR 185 million respectively (expressed in 2011 prices). Austria benefited from a gross reduction in its annual GNI contribution until 2016.

At least the UK rebate question ends now. Sweden is not an euro zone country either, so there is really no reason as to Danes paying more than Swedes. And what's up with Finland only paying half of Denmark, although being a comparable economy.

Energy, machinery, electronics, and chemicals are some prevalent industries that come to mind immediately. The Netherlands is also the world's second largest exporter of agricultural products due to its intensive and highly mechanized farming techniques. The Port of Rotterdam is Europe's busiest port which, for example, serves as the principal shipping port of heavy industries located in Western Germany.

All of this requires a lot of transportation (not just industry as you suggested). The big problem with your argument is that you equate transportation with vehicle use which is just totally wrong. Transportation of goods via river and rail is generally much more efficient than road transportation and used widely across the Netherlands. Such a trade-driven economy needs a very dense transportation network which includes highways but what it certainly doesn't need are highways or ever more roads within cities, no matter the degree of industrialization.",,/r/europe/comments/f1ey68/the_restoration_of_utrechts_800yearold_city_moat/fh7jnij/,MajorSaltburn,1581335011

2687,"&gt; minimizing car traffic in cities is nice. 

Sure it is.  Worldwide there are more cars on the road this second than there were when I began writing this sentence.  

Im not sure Im still talking about this picture, or even about Europe, because its a big world, bubble boys (teasing).  But in the spirit of generalisation there are two points to add to this:

1. How is the minimising carried out?  What technique is used?  Is it simply destruction and disincentive?  

All those people driving cars are doing so for a reason.  Some of those reasons might allow for more easy substitution to other types of transport or even to other reasons, than others.  The anti-car projects in Western cities are usually a just a scattershot of local neighbourhood projects more related to local real estate values than a comprehensive transport plan for *transitioning*.  

ie. Cycling plans too often function by removing vehicle space.

If you live in Amsterdam, I congratulate you for living in the best planned (ie. Masterplanned; designed) city on the planet, based around the bicycle-trip unit.  

But I believe even Amsterdam has sprawl, and probably more each day.  Thats my second point.  The one about the bubble.  There's the suburbs and, then, beyond that, the rest of the world.  

There is a harm to this trend; the design trend I mean; the type of planning that's happening; its rejection of data and rigour.  Its principles are unsteady; Architecturally flawed.",,/r/europe/comments/f1ey68/the_restoration_of_utrechts_800yearold_city_moat/fh7b7l1/,ripe_program,1581322855

2696,"I don't live in Amsterdam, and it also is by far not even the best city when it comes to cycling infrastructure. Groningen or Utrecht or even Zwolle (where I live) have way better cycling infrastructure. Amsterdam only usually dominates those lists because it's the only Dutch city they look at. But within the Netherlands, I reckon it's not even top 10.

And making cars city free over here, is actually aimed at better air quality, and to encourage public transport use and cycling. Then again, cycling already is the most used form of commuting (more than cars), so it's already in our culture. So perhaps for us it's easier to make these transitions than other nations.

Plus, like you said, our infrastructure is built around cycling and has been for ages. Also, lot's of old city centers simply don't have the room to accommodate (the amount and size of modern) cars. So it's actually a lot quicker and easier to get around on a bicycle.

I mean, here in Zwolle where i live, they actually direct car traffic all around the city to increase commute time. But we have special bridges only for public transport and cycling that are short cuts. If you live in a outer neighborhood of Zwolle, you are actually encouraged to bike or use public transport, since it simply is two or three timers faster.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/f1ey68/the_restoration_of_utrechts_800yearold_city_moat/fh7bfqu/,My-Name-Is-Blackbird,1581323174

So unless Denmark, Norway or some LPG terminals connected with German grid will have some extra capacities of tens of billions m3, then there won't be enough of gas excess in the network to re-export. 

It will look much better when Poland upgrades its LPG terminal from 5 to 7,5bln m3 and the pipe capable of transporting 10bln m3 from Denmark to Poland is build. Then with 4bln national production and 18bln total consumption Poland won't have to import 100% from Russia. Import of 30% should be rather save, because as you say smaller amounts can be replaced with import from the West and the threat of cutting off 30% is not as great as of 100%.

The correct way to vote in Ireland is to vote by preference. For example voting for only one Candidate is usually silly 

The best, most effective way is to then Rerank that preference order by reverse viability.


Now as to why I voted for the local mental, well I don't love any Candiate or Party in my area, I'm not giving a 1st preference vote to FF FG or SF. 1st preference votes contribute to political funding, they will be used to boast about popularity etc.

This way I can increase the non gov 1st preference vote. It will be for a non Government Candiate no matter what happens in the election or what Government we get.


And in all honesty, the biggest reason, was for my own sense of humour.

&amp;#x200B;

In Poland, the rule of law is under ever greater threat The PiS government is bringing the judiciary under political control  Judges of Poland's appeals court. 

Some of the country's courts have postponed hearings because of uncertainty over whether judges have authority to make rulings 

&amp;#x200B;

 The EU is built on the rule of law. A threat to judges’ independence in one country can erode the legal foundations of the 27-nation single market. The EU now faces just such a situation, in its sixth-largest economy. 

Poland’s president last week signed what critics have called a “muzzle law”, allowing the nationalist government to fire judges who criticise its reforms. The country’s Supreme Court has said that some judges appointed under new rules introduced by this government are illegitimate. 

The stand-off could have EU-wide repercussions.  The Law and Justice (PiS) government has been locked in a power struggle with Poland’s judiciary since it was elected in 2015. Ministers argue personnel and procedures were never properly overhauled after communism fell in 1989, and courts are inefficient. 

Many reforms PiS has introduced, they say, simply copy practices elsewhere.  Most judges, however, are too young to have served pre-1989, and PiS has done little to ease the real causes of judicial delays. Independent experts suggest the government has stitched together elements resembling those in other EU countries into a framework that has one real purpose: to bring the judiciary under political control.  

Following the playbook of Hungary’s nationalist government, PiS swiftly neutered Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal — which rules on whether legislation complies with the fundamental law — by packing it with loyalist judges. Pressed by the European Court of Justice, the government backed off from some other contentious moves, such as trying to force one-third of Supreme Court judges into early retirement, including its president, Malgorzata Gersdorf. 

But the government still ensured a majority of members of the National Judicial Council, which appoints judges, are now picked by the PiS-dominated parliament.  Last year, PiS created a disciplinary chamber — appointed by the Polish president from names chosen by the National Judicial Council — that can suspend judges.

Polish judges queried the move with the EU’s top court, which in November set out criteria to test if the chamber violated judicial independence. Using those standards, Poland’s top court ruled that it did.  PiS doubled down. 

In December it pushed through Poland’s lower house the “muzzle law” allowing judges who question the government’s legal reforms to be fined or even sacked. After the upper house rejected it, the lower house passed it again in January. 

The Supreme Court hit back on the same day by saying judges appointed by the rejigged NJC were illegitimate.  Chaos now threatens. Some courts have postponed hearings because of uncertainty over whether judges have authority to make rulings. 

Parallel legal systems are emerging: one set of judges loyal to Ms Gersdorf’s Supreme Court, and another to the government-friendly constitutional tribunal.  If the Polish government’s real aim is to provide more effective justice, it would do better to backtrack. 

More likely, it will sit tight until Ms Gersdorf reaches the end of her term on April 30, and replace her with a loyalist.  The EU should then eschew talk of a conciliatory “reset” with Poland that has surfaced since a new European Commission took office late last year. Brussels must continue to use the European Court to challenge PiS’s attempts to cow the judiciary. 

Above all, EU states should not shrink from linking future disbursement of lucrative structural funds to upholding the rule of law. Membership of the EU club comes with strings, for good reason. States cannot expect to enjoy all the benefits without following the rules.",,/r/europe/comments/f1i0z9/in_poland_the_rule_of_law_is_under_ever_greater/fh63e9b/,AdministrativePilot3,1581294754

If I were a Moldovan, I'd lobby to get annexed into Romania, East Germany style, as soon as possible. The current clusterfuck is way too messy to fix it, Romania might not be Germany but it's still levels above Moldova, and it would be a shortcut into the EU. However, if the population there feels they're not Romanians, they have a right to have their own country. 

Transnistria, meanwhile, is just a geopolitical tool for Russia, an occupied region of Moldova. Its identity is based pretty much on USSR, although leaning more towards Putin's Russia in time.

When people in field say that academics have no idea at all what goes beyond the campus, this is exactly what they talk about.

Ok? Okay. Lets explain. First, largest group are Syrians. Investing in Syria can be done only and solely via syphoning any help via Assad government. Assad government however has zero interest in any rule beyond rule of iron fist. So there goes, them moolahs gonna be syphoned and you will never know where it ended. Also most of these Syrians have been living in Turkey for years now. So EU made deal with Erdogan that saw billions syphoned to him. Money that should've been spent on betterment of Syrian refugee camps, funding the asylum process within Turkey and so on. 5 years later and there is utterly no visible improvement in those areas and TK solution for the time being seems to be forced expulsion of Syrians to their 'buffer zones' in order to A, remove them from Turkish territory and B, engineer ethnical demographicak change in Turkish surrounding border by forcing out native kurdish population and replacing them with mostly arab syrian refugees.

Beyond the Syria, in places like Astan or basically any region of Africa the funds go only via UNCHR, IOM or organizations directlly under control of EU. Thing that these academica bash - all y'all should give the money to local grassroot and it be great. I know because I spent 7 days in Lagos and yada yada yada

Now the reason why its done like that is the same why WHO doesnt do food deliveries via govs for a long time - the moment you lost full control of money movement in Africa, them money is gone gone. It WILL be syphoned away by oligarchy and local hustlers.

Rule of law and such are things that are. Not. Bought. They can only be built from bottom up by entire society.

This point of Guardian just demonstrate how utterly inept these people are in what they do. ""Throw money on it"" never solved a goddamn thing in Africa and Middle East. Your advocacy to take money from border control, which we cab control, and just scatter it to the wind in MEA is dumbshit and will never produce a fuck. Hence why its alwats with addendum of ""it will take long time and difficult process"" and such and such. Its convinient defense when after years of wasting Joe Taxpayer paycheck on virtual projects in MEA you accomplished nothing that can be demonstrated on any metrics.

Which is similar to what many NGOs done on Aegan islands, their public-private funding oft wasted and used as cover for sometimes illicit activities. If you get out of that campus and visit Lesvos or Samos and ask locals of what they think, you'd be quite surprised about their opinion of you.

&gt;This is what “journalism” is for.

The organizations which publish newspapers, or broadcast on TV or on the radio have costly bills to foot, which are generally covered by capitalists if said organizations are privately owned. At the same time, they need to maintain ties to official sources of information (e.g. from the government). Both of these elements shape the way in which information is presented, framed, narrated; and also *which* information is transmitted in the first place.

Thanks to the way in which journalism is conducted, we're at least three decades late in the fight against global heating, to make an example, because capital funds scientific misinformation.

You don't think this is true? Let me put a funky mirror in front of your face:

Go ask Mr. Höcke what he thinks about democracy. You'll be surprised.

This isn't new. People like you and their parties have perverted the word democracy abundantly in the past. GDR: German DEMOCRATIC republic. They even kept the SPD around as a pet to fake choice. The funny part is in your little justification dillusion you guys actually believe the farce is true.

Quite the mastery in mind bending techniques:

I make a well founded claim. You call me a liar. I back it up with hard evidence. You say I'm grasping on straws. I say you are an extremist. You say you simply have ""a different view"". Höcke is a Nazi. He probably calls himself something like a ""concerned citizen"".

All the same. Anti-democratic parties are still anti-democratic even if the try to use democracy to establish their system. It is true for die Linke and it is true for the AfD. Same thing just on the opposite side of the political spectrum.

You say die Linke doesn't say anything about abolishing a true multiparty democracy? Funny... the AfD doesn't either. Let me see... could it be that this would totally destroy both parties in the public opinion? Could it be that this would be straight up unconstitutionally in the FRG? Hmmmmm....

It encourages the spread. Remember, the easiest way to make people want to read a book is to ban it. The Catholic Church tried that before. People are going to speak to one another whether you like it or not. By banning speech you just make them look like martyrs which makes people think the government has something to hide and that these conspiracy theories are onto something. Holocaust denial laws only increase the spread of people who deny the Holocaust.

&gt; No, but you're reinforcing an ideology (whether intentional or not) that harms gay people's lives in a significant manner. Same with using gay as an insult, e.g. ""that's so gay"" is pretty much used in lieu of ""that's so bad/shit"". Not really the same as calling for genocide, but still causes measurable harm.

It only causes measurable harm if you let yourself be harmed, and even then there’s nothing measurable out it. This is about self-esteem. You can put people in jail for saying insults to people. That’s absurd and is disempowering to the gay community.

However in 1800s we find the use of the word ""Itál"" and at least 3 forms of the adjective ""italian"": italský, italický and italianský. This might be related to the political reality of the day: Austrian empire possessing some lands in Italy, moving Italian troops to Czechia and/or Czech troops to Italy, Napoleonic wars which cause massive movement of troops back and forth. So Czechs came into contact with Italians and probably took their endonym. The adjective fluctuation eventually ended with the first form winning.

By mid 8th century, the population fell to about 70 thousands. It must have been a ghost town, with people dwelling in a city built for population ten times as big. There's literary and archaeological evidence of even regular farming being done within the walls. The actual ""city life"" with trade and crafts was probably reduced to a few clusters, separated by orchards, gardens and fields which were in turn dotted by overgrown ruins.

The city somewhat recovered by high middle ages, but it never reached the population levels of its early history.

&gt; the offence of bringing a person into undeserved disrepute by making false statements (whether written or spoken).

Yeah,  but people make false statements all the time, often because they don’t know they’re false. That’s why many countries’ defamation law looks to intent. 


&gt; If I bring you into disrepute by saying true things, I should not be punished. If, however, I bring you into disrepute by saying false things, I should be punished. In other words, as I see it, you should be free to bring someone into disrepute as long as the things you say are true. It follows that you must be rigorous in your judgement when accusing someone of disreputable acts seeing that someone's reputation should not be taken lightly given the possible lifelong repercussions as well as the time and effort that it may have taken to build and maintain their good reputation.


Pssshhh.... someone’s reputation should be taken with a grain of salt. If someone is actually being mistreated, then they can speak for themselves and explain why they’re being mistreated, then they will get sympathy for being mistreated if that is the case. Especially if the person involved is a public figure with a platform to make their own case. Then their accusers will look like fools if they point out how they’re wrong.

Since people live together in families and communities where blood ties and cultural similarities foster cooperation, those who are different undermine this social solidarity. The very presence of people who are different in appearance or belief or language make the majority of people in a community wary of those who do not share a common interest in preserving the dominant group. 

&gt;This fear is justified since people naturally view those who look, believe, and act in a similar manner as extensions of themselves. Since people are naturally selfish, they will lend aid and befriend those whom they see as similar to themselves.

3620,"&gt; The thought crime is the crime of thinking. A thought crime is not actual spoken words or an action. No one is banning thoughts, ergo, this is not a thought crime.

This is semantics. “Through crimes” obviously do not exist in the way you describe because it’s impossible to read people’s thoughts. The criticism of “ thought crimes” in the manner means criminalizing people for thinking a certain way. Because that’s what this is really about.


&gt; Also, an inherent freedom of speech, a concept many countries do not even have, does not protect hate, acts of hate, or hate speech; while political speech is however protected. Therefore, it doesn't necessarily devalue anyone's principles.



This I cannot understand. This sounds dirty to me and foreign to my own culture and understanding of free speech. Hate speech is protected where I live and needs to be under my principles.

I have already said that these behaviors are unacceptable and regardless if the motive is racism or not the punishment should be the same. The same crime should always have the same penalty regardless the motive, except if the motive is at the same time a mitigating factor.

Regarding racism I also expressed my opinion and I disagree with you:  
If these behaviors were actually racism then probably they would have been happening before the epidemic and would continue after it. If they only happen during the epidemic they are obviously caused because of it and not because of xenophobia.

3725,"Let's continue this discussion then.
Reliable ally? 
During ww1 they joined their 'allies' when the war was already almost over in 1917 while millions of British and French troops already lost their lives.
During ww2 they didn't join at all it was only because Japan attacked them directly that they finally decided to join the war because their own interests were threatened. 

 &gt; France on the other hand was rather unreliable, focused on herself

If France was focused on herself then they wouldn't declared war to Germany in the first place.
The drôle de guerre comes from poor French leadership not because they're unreliable, French and British kept their words on this, if there was an attack against Poland they would both declare war on Germany.
Same situation for ww1, Fr and UK declared war to honour their alliance with the Russian Empire and Serbia.

&gt; Surrendering to Germany after third defeat did give France an image of lightweight and pushover.

Usual 'surrender monkey' meme. I mean is that all you got?

In all seriousness this can be found out pretty easily.  Turkeys population is 82,003,000 while Istanbul province is 15,214,000, leaving a population of 66,789,000 for the rest of Turkey.

Total GDP in PPP is $2.186 trillion while Istanbul’s is $682 billion, leaving $1,504 trillion for the rest of Turkey.

GDP per capita for Turkey using these numbers is $26,657, while for Turkey excluding Istanbul it is be $22,517.  From there it looks like Turkey’s economy would be 15.5% smaller without Istanbul province assuming all numbers are accurate.  Not quite as bad as I thought it would be, a little worse than France but I was expecting it to be worse than even Greece.

3911,"&gt; I think that it could happen to people that their place of origin could be identified by their external characteristics. Many Europeans fall into the category we call Caucasians so it would be difficult to make the distinction of Belgians.

Yes, it'd likely be difficult to tell them apart by appearance- so by that logic, why not kick the white French off of public transport because they look Caucasian? Too much effort to bother trying anything to tell them apart from some Flemish fellow who maybe could be sick, just ruin their day to be sure and wait for the applause to roll in for supporting the public health in such an effective manner. Meanwhile, what are the public vaccination rates in France?

&gt; If it's racial then probably it used to happen before the epidemic and will continue after it. If not, then it's not racial.

How is it not racial when people are being treated differently because of their race? Sure the disease presents a background, but that doesn't mean it's magically not racist to be kick off some person from the bus who's lived in France all their life not even based on symptoms or anything other than that they look vaguely similar to some folks who caught a disease on the other side of the world.

&gt; When almost 100% of the patients are Chinese you can get alarmed by a person's appearance. Seeing an East Asian means statistically you are in contact with a person of the highest risk group.

The virus started in China and ran up the numbers there, but it does not discriminate in who it infects. France recently got five cases of infected British people at some ski resort, which is about half the cases that they have. If you're petrified of people with Asian ethnicity in France and don't pay attention to the others hacking and coughing as a result, are you truly safer for it? You can't tell by looking who has been to Wuhan or has some chain of associates who has, so you can't accurately evaluate who is high risk by appearance alone. Symptoms, contacts and history are a better measure, which is why quarantines use those as criteria rather than just how you look.

&gt; Wouldn't you be more concerned about HIV for example if you lived in Lesotho or if a large number of immigrants started to arrive to Europe from there? The virus is not visible, but definitely the probability to find a carrier among a high risk population is far greater than in Europe.

You can think how you like of whatever person and decide to take what actions to secure your health based on your own risk analysis, but you don't have the right as a private individual to lay your hands on someone and eject them on basis of their appearance. Particularly since making physical contact with someone you believe to be sick is a terrible idea. Wear a mask, wash your hands, do whatever the doctor says but your hands better stop with you. What right would I have to try to pitch a random black person out of a vehicle because some random African country that chances are likely they have zero connection with has had an illness crop up? And what idiocy, too, since that's much more liable to put me in close contact with their fluids. If I'm really that concerned about disease, public transit is a terrible idea in the first place.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/eymqqk/coronavirus_france_faces_epidemic_of_antiasian/fh2126p/,sparkling_uranium,1581230683

3978,"The reconstruction is by [Antoine Helbert](http://www.antoine-helbert.com/fr/portfolio/annexe-work/byzance-architecture.html), for the very beginning of the 13th century -- before 1203-4, that is -- for which it's largely accurate. There are a few anachronisms in there, on purpose -- most notably the column of Constantine, which lost its statue of its namesake in the early 12th century in a storm, replaced by a golden cross which he provides an interpretation of further down -- but otherwise there aren't any glaring inaccuracies. The vast majority of the monuments and infrastructure in the picture did in fact remain intact up to the Fourth Crusade, and many remarkably authentic reconstructions of middle-period structures can be seen throughout the image, including Constantine V's rebuilt Hagia Eirene, Theophilos's Sigma-Triconch hall and renovated Boukoleon palace, Basil I's Nea Ekklesia, new polo field, and Church of St Mary at the Forum, Constantine VII's rebuilt Walled Obelisk in the Hippodrome sheathed in gilded bronze, Nikephoros Phokas's Great Palace wall, and Constantine IX's palace and monastery in Mangana, though some of these are admittedly quite hard to see in the compressed, low-res version in the OP. 

Additionally, the reconstruction only shows the very eastern tip of the city, its monumental core, which was mostly spared by the fires of 1203-4 (with the exception of the upper-left quarter of the image, and elsewhere less so by the Crusaders who followed, as far as metal statues, roofs, and fittings were concerned) and extensively restored under Micheal VIII and Andronikos II -- who renovated the Mese porticoes, the Hippodrome, certain forums, a number of baths, sections of the Great Palace, the Harbours of Kontoskelion and Julian, a number of hospitals, certain law courts, and a wide array of churches and monasteries -- so it may not have looked *so* different from the OP in the last few decades of the 13th century at least. Islamic and Russian visitors of the 13th and 14th centuries still attest to the impressive state of the city's columns, churches, palaces, statues (some of which were new), Hippodrome, and paved streets and forums. It was only with the wars, isolation, commercial decline, and plagues of the mid-late 14th century onward that Palaiologian Constantinople started to become the decrepit, fragmented, and underpopulated city it's known for being by 1453.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/f0wpla/constantinople_in_the_13th_century/fh1qa3t/,Majorianos,1581221078

Most free trade agreements, and certainly all European Union ones, are mostly made up of the list of regulations and standards that must be implemented in order for the tariffs to be reduced.  Quite literally, EU FTAs export European standards across the world, as well as give the EU mechanisms to ensure those standards are implemented.  As for your example, the best thing the EU can do in order to stop those unfair trade practices through Vietnam is to sign an FTA with them to empower the EU in that situation.  This is precisely why the EU has demanded the UK maintain regulatory standards in return for their FTA.  Therefore, while I share your concerns about Vietnam and its trade, I think an FTA is one of the best ways to exert economic influence there in the EU's interest.","Minnesota, America",/r/europe/comments/ezvzkl/euvietnam_trade_deal_agreed_by_negotiators_99_of/fh1b2em/,Trayeth,1581212954

Sinn Fein originally sprung up as a movement against British Rule, and have remained such. They would never in a million years align with Britain, so while they might be Euroskeptic (I personally am not sure of that, citations needed), they'd rather stay in Europe than fall back into Britain's lap.

Sinn Fein are also an untested party in the Republic, having never been part of the republic's government since its foundation. And while some would see it as a left party, others would judge it to be the most far-right major party in the country.

They're also trying desperately to shake off ties from the terrorist group IRA. Again, whether they have or not is anyone's guess. Their major agenda would be to unify Ireland, but unification would require a gentle touch in such an unstable atmosphere. There are doubts that Sinn Fein would have the required feather-touch.

4310,"**SUMMARY OF THE BILL**

The government is not allowed to contract the use of any private facility to house detained illegal immigrants.
  
It implements ""catch and release"" in effect by imposing the following the conditions.

After detaining an illegal immigrant, the government must...
  
1.  Make a determination of whether or not the illegal immigrant is likely to show up for his hearing. 
  
2.  If he/she is unlikely to show, the government must impose the most lenient possible conditions to compel them to show up.

3.  If a bond is set, it cannot be an amount that would impose a financial hardship on the immigrant. 
  
4.  You can't impose conditions on a young person, old person, gay person, pregnant person, transgender person, a person who claims to be a victim of a crime, a person who has filed a civil complaint, is a witness to a crime, claims to have been a victim of sexism, speaks no or limited English and doesn't immediately have access to a translator, or has any kind of mental or behavioral disorder.

5.  If the immigrant is detained, they get a de novo hearing every 60 days.  This basically means that every 60 days they can start the process over from scratch and make a new claim that would get them released.
  
6.  Allows border patrol to stop and interrogate people about immigration status, but only if they do so not based on the person's race or English language proficiency or **even their nationality**.
  
7.  If someone is detained but wants to claim that their initial stop lacked probable cause, they get a hearing within 48 hours.  

8.  All illegal immigrants **are presumed to be releasable on their own recognizance** unless the government can prove a high likelihood that they will not show up for their hearing.
  
So, that's the basics of the bill.  It's essentially a re-implementation of Catch and Release.

4362,"&gt;aldi, lidl, etc should be the best shit ever for anyone who cares about money, really. the stigma that only poor people go there or whatever (which luckily doesn't exist in Germany for the most case) is just stupid

&gt;lots of the products they sell are just rebranded high quality stuff, they even come from the exact same company

I agree but I came across very different sentiments here in Germany.

The majority doesn't want to admit that they shop at Aldi or Lidl. Not only because it allegedly is ""for lower class people"" but also because of ethical reasons ans reasons concerning quality.

Cashiers/workers are allegedly exploited/payed way too less. I know that people in other countries (especially the US) would dream of such working conditions but the opinion here is: The working conditions for cashiers in stores such as Aldi and Lidl are terrible.

They also sell cheap knock-off brands that aren't exactly the same quality as our real brands and the food there isn't ethical/organic enough.

""I don't shop at stores such as Aldi or Lidl! I exclusively visit our local organic Bio Laden or Reformhaus! The organic quality at Aldi or Lidl isn't real organic food...yadda yadda""

I don't share this opinion but whenever Aldi has a new great vegan product...beware to mention so in a vegan forum/group because you will get:
""People who shop at Aldi aren't vegan anyways! Such terrible working conditions and not really organic!""

Idk I think it has become trendy to flex that you can afford to buy everything 100% organic and fair trade from a Bio Markt or Reformhaus instead of going to a supermarket like ""all those stupid sheeple"" do.",,/r/europe/comments/f0rlks/eastern_europe_in_one_picture/fgz63kp/,high_priestess23,1581191137

4366,"&gt; Right, so France isn't benefitting from from favorable resource deals that would have been under threat if Islamists took over? Amd France wont be getting new favorable deals in return for propping up these governments?

That a stupid way of trying to blame France for intervening. France has interest like many other countries but who has called for help? Who has liberated the places? And who is keeping the peace? Dafuq is wrong with you, you talk like they didn't fucking saved millions of people of being enslaved like those who got caught by Boko Haram. You got some serious trouble in the head or what?

&gt;you will find plenty of non Islamist locals who oppose France's presence.

Yeah but that wasn't the case when their villages where getting burned, Africans are not well know for their long term view and right now it's the same politicians who called France for help who are trying to make the people revolt against France, but what they are trying to get is some cash, as usual.

&gt;No, America is providing the long range in-flight refueling needed to make these campaigns possible, France doesnt have sufficient capabilities in this area to cover the massive distances needed.

That's not an aid that would jeopardise the operation if it wasn't there, and it isn't any real military support. It's the same with dozen of countries, minimal. NATO is nowhere on sight and only French forces are fighting alongside African forces that they have to train and need to give weapon to.

&gt;Yeah, because we believe sending our people to die to prop up puppet governments in exchange for economic resources that will disproportionately benefit the French ruling class is immoral.

Again, manicheaism, when bombs explodes in city centers everyone is crying that something has to be done or should have be done long time ago to prevent it... but when prevention is done it's always ONLY for secret purpose and business.

Good to know who I'm talking to, if it was for you the whole Sahara would have been enslaved and burned down.

Human beings have their baser instincts and their higher ideals, right? There's the bit that's lazy and who only cares about themselves. For example it's natural for toddlers to be self-centered and unable to consider the emotions of others, because their brain is still under development and they're learning. An adult however should know better.

It is not acceptable for someone older to have a tantrum, or to bully others for something they want. It is human nature for someone to be greedy and maybe even violent, but if they rob someone they'll be punished for it (hopefully).

Something being human nature doesn't mean it's inevitable or acceptable. It's a quirk of the psyche that needs to be identified and guarded against. That's my opinion at least.

It might be $5-10 if you have a good employer with good insurance. That's what it was when I worked for a labor union. But then you still have to add the cost of your monthly premium (For me currently, $421 per month), and you also have to pay to go to the doctor to get that prescription through your deductible. For example, I pay 1/3 of the cost of any doctor visit, plus a deductible.

Now, my plan is worse than most. I'm working temp-to-hire for the federal government through a staffing agency right now.

4891,"I understand the idea of this but it's not really something I agree with. In the UK for example they floated the idea of a small flat payment for visiting a GP, to avoid people doing superfluous visits. (10£ or so). The problem however with any flat fee is that it disproportionately affects people on low income. If £10 is a lot of money to you (and plenty of such people exist), you might avoid necessary primary and preventative care, if 10£ is a drop of water in the sea as far as you're concerned, you'll still go whenever you fancy. If you add into consideration that there are many people on little to no income because of health reasons, this seems like it could cause a pretty morbid downward spiral for some of the most vulnerable of us. I certainly agree that there's many people who abuse the healthcare system, but I think the risk of excluding people on low incomes makes such a fee morally a bad idea, and if it leads to small problems becoming big problems because they aren't treated early it may even prove to be a financially bad idea too.",,/r/europe/comments/f0oq3i/this_is_what_1074_euros_of_antimigrane_medicine/fgw254h/,jam11249,1581155819

It seems like a silly argument to me that people go ""oh, it's a great idea, and everyone wants to do it, but because of a law in Austria it can't happen"". Laws are amenable to political will. It could be reformulated that an attack on a member state could be considered an attack on Austria itself, which for all intents and purposes it would be seeing as we have such an integrated political system.

Anyways, this wouldn't be an ""Austrian army"", so I don't know how that argument would even effect Austria's neutrality. This would be an EU army probably formed by volunteers like in most modern armies. It obviously would not involve conscription. It'd be like UN forces. People can volunteer if they wish to serve. I don't see a problem with private Austrian citizens volunteering to join it. It's not like individuals in Austria are forbidden from joining UN peacekeeping forces. That Austria would have to pay for some of its maintenance, well, I'm sure there's a workaround to that too. They pay into the EU discretionary budget, and then the EU decides to earmark some of that for the army. Austria doesn't directly fund an army. It's up to courts to decide.

Happens a lot in rural and disconnected areas where forming economic and urban centers is a difficult task. Albanian landscape is a very rugged and mountainous terrain making this quite a feat to achieve, especially back when technology was not as advanced as today. 

And we are not talking about a decentralized but defined unit (similar to Hindus, Greeks or Arabs). We are talking about disconnected entities. Not even units. Tribes of similar linguistics and customs went on to form the Albanian unit. Illyrian or other tribes at the area were not absorbed in this unit because of different reasons such as being completely different from the Albanian unit or dying out as a phenomenon before the Albanian idea began to form. The later probably happened to the Illyrians since they themselves were disconnected and not well defined. This disconnection helped in their extinctions or absorbsion by better defined people around them.

5010,"""Madrid is a strange place anyway. I do not believe any one likes it much when he first goes there. It has none of the look that you expect of Spain. It is modern rather than picturesque, no costumes, practically no Cordoban hats, except on the heads of phonies, no castanets, and no disgusting fakes like the gypsy caves at Granada. There is not one local-colored place for tourists in the town. Yet when you get to know it, it is the most Spanish of all cities, the best to live in, the finest people, month in and month out the finest climate and while the other big cities are all very representative of the province they are in, they are either Andalucian, Catalan, Basque, Aragonese, or otherwise provincial. It is in Madrid only that you get the essence. The essence, when it is the essence, can be in a plain glass bottle and you need no fancy labels, nor in Madrid do you need any national costumes; no matter what sort of building they put up, though the building itself may look like Buenos Aires, when you see it against that sky you know it is Madrid. If it had nothing else than the Prado it would be worth spending a month in every spring, if you have money to spend a month in any European capital. But when you can have the Prado and the bullfight season at the same time with El Escorial not two hours to the north and Toledo to the south, a fine road to Avila and a fine road to Segovia, which is no distance from La Granja, it makes you feel very badly, all question of immortality aside, to know that you will have to die and never see it again.""

It costs cents to ten's of cents to buy better quality RJ45 connectors and cables.

Best case is I break a tab while making cables. This might cost as little as $5 of time plus the cost of the connector and an inch of cable.

A small multistory building or a medium industrial site could use $600 of labour to diagnose this fault (ignoring transit). Charging for this if you or your company installed the cable is a great way to never work for that client again.

I haven't had an RJ45 tab break in over a decade because neither I or my employers use low quality cables and connectors.

Even I have had clients were it makes more sense to use the cheapest connector or cable available. But inventory is a thing and connectors are bought in bulk.

5145,"&gt;""According to 2011 census, 58.79% of Albania's population adheres to Islam, making it the largest religion in the country.""

No, they don't.

Why do people base their claims on inaccurate evidence? If you did a little research you would find out that the 2011 census is extremely misleading because it is flat out wrong.

&gt;According to other older sources, up to 75 percent of the population in Albania has declared no religious affiliation since the early 1990s.

&gt;In the 2011 census, preliminary results showed 70% of Albanians refusing to declare belief in any of the listed faiths although the final results may have differed markedly from this in showing the majority of Albanians associated with Islam and Christianity while 16.3% of Albanians either didn't answer or were atheist and another 5.5% were listed as ""believers without (specific) faith"". The final results were nevertheless criticized by numerous communities as well as international organizations such as the Council of Europe, and news media noted concerns that there were reports where workers filled out the religion question without actually asking the participants, and that they used pencils which wasn't allowed, possibly leading to incorrect tallies.

&gt;There were serious allegations about the conduct of the census workers that might have impacted on the 2011 census results. There were some reported cases where workers filled out the questionnaire about religion without even asking the participants or that the workers used pencils which were not allowed. In some cases communities declared that census workers never even contacted them. Additionally, the preliminary results released seemed to give widely different results, with 70% of respondents refusing to declare belief in any of the listed faiths, compared with only 16% of atheists and undeclared in the final results. It was reported in Albanian media that there were instances of pollsters telling respondents that the religion question would be filled out for them. Albanian commenters also argue that the census takers guessed religion based on the responders family names and that even the census responders did give an answer based on family origin and not actual religion.",Albania,/r/europe/comments/eyjkkw/what_do_you_know_about_albania/fgv0c39/,Deer_Noises,1581133628

5150,"How do I respond to so many comments? Imma single out yours and reply to that.

First of all, I should have expanded but hate reading long comments so thought what I posted was suffice. It wasn't.  

Vietnam is a place through which China for example dodges tariffs and dumps products on countries, if anything our latest Trump - lev parnas tape should be a big red flag concerning just this. South-korea and ""Vietnam..."" and ""Especially south korea"" (which is unfortunate for the reasons that our coalition went to war for them of course but unrelated to this issue) are shipping Chinese steel to the US to bypass tarrifs. This means it is already a 'smuggling' hub for Chinese unregulated products as we speak to the US.

Now I want you to think about the consequences of this, China steals western technology because we were greedy enough to outsource all our manufacturing there, that's right, it's our fault, but let's not infinitely dwell on that and realize that the know how travels to wherever the production happens.  

The same economists that brought you absurd trickle down economics are the ones supplying you your ‘free’ trade mentality. European countries of before, you know when they governed pretty much all of international law (and the world) were very much aware of the importance of protective measures to the internal market. You’d think we would all realize we know this EVEN today! We produce more than 30% of global food-crops using less land/water, creating less waste, using less labor and delivering a high quality product because of something that costs more than 30% of ALL the EU budget it’s called the CAP look it up. We would not want to harm our farmers just to buy more bulk flour for the bread-maker.  

Trade is not free when children or slaves produce your goods just because there is no tariff put on it. If anything as developed economies we should maintain tariffs with any country not adhering to the same regulations that face our businesses, simply because that is how you keep our market competitive and assure a level playing field while meanwhile pushing for the global appeal of the ‘Brussels's effect’. 

Much like we are now asking the UK to maintain a level playing field and pretty please with sugar on top not dump unregulated products on us.

Nobody likes trump neither do I, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be treating china in a similar fashion. We want to maintain peace, never ever again start an offensive conflict this should be a EU prerogative, but that doesn’t mean we should sit idly by while others neglect how you want our products to be produced. Yeah sure, EU mandating packaging, another wasteful hindrance that only serves to fill up the oceans and not the coffers of EU businesses.  

I am firmly pro-EU but I believe a radical drop from the liberal economics that the left was first blaming the US for its huge trade deficit and public deficit while maintaining that any moment now some invisible hand in the FOREX markets will push the RESERVE currency of the world, the US dollar into some kind of equilibrium. My money is on keeping regulations tight with any outside EU country, especially one close to China.

5275,"Here's the timeline. The information is selected from various local newspapers and centralized by national newscaster Digi24. The town is called Ditrău, located in Harghita county.

* **29.01**: Up to 2,500 people protest on social networks and call on the local administration to ban two bakery workers from Sri Lanka. The protests are aggressive and include calls to violence. The two Sri Lankan bakers have had to move twice, to a neighboring city, out of concern for their own safety, after their landlords received threats. Locals' reasons seem to be fear that more immigrants will follow. Worries are particularly centered on the fact they're men and imply they will be rapists. The bakery is 10 years old and has previously used employees from Hungary and Switzerland without protest. The owner resorted to hiring from outside the country because it's impossible to find qualified bakers locally. He is very pleased with the two Sri Lankans and plans to hire more people from Sri Lanka and Nepal. The bakery workers support their foreign colleagues. Local priest claims that the locals' fears originate back in 1986 when conflicts with a nearby Roma community resulted in one dead. The priest leads 200 locals to a physical protest in front of City Hall.
* **30.01**: More interviews with locals. They say they're worried that the same things will happen as in other European countries that allowed lots of immigrants. They keep hearing about immigrants being violent, rapists, they end up forming ghettos. They see the two bakers as an omen of things to come. The town mayor admits that the fact they're black is a factor in them not being accepted. He thinks the locals would have been more lenient if they had been announced ahead of time and wishes he had the foresight to put things to them in advance. He points out that, ironically, the lack of bakers in town is due to lots of people working in other countries, which raises the question how *they're* being treated over there.
* **31.01**: More interviews. The Sri Lankan bakers are very pleased with their coworkers, who reciprocate. The bakers say they like Romania in general but refuse to say anything about the hostile locals. The locals are making it very clear that their hostility is tied to racism and xenophobia, they quote generic objections regarding religion, race, diseases, different culture etc. Representatives of the regional branch of the Work Ministry arrives to check things out and finds that the bakers have been lawfully hired and their status is perfectly in order. A well known political analyst (CTP) notes that it is ironic that the town locals are not accepting of cultural differences when they are a Hungarian community in the middle of Romania. He claims that this is the result of ""Orbanism"" propaganda from Hungary. He calls for an investigation into the threats against the bakers.
* **01.02**: The local priest is publicly chastised by the regional Archbishop, who points out that Christians should be accepting of people of different religions. The town council holds a large meeting (300 people) to debate the issue, but the discussion veers towards the relation between the bakery owner and its employees, who claim they're not being fairly compensated for overtime. The mayor claims that the foreigners are unwitting victims of this older antagonism between the owner and the workers. The owner claims that he has always payed his employees properly. The meeting concludes peacefully. The owner decides to change the positions of the Sri Lankans so they're not directly involved in the bread making, following claims from the locals that they'll stop buying the bakery's products otherwise. The locals boycott the bakery, causing a drop of 30% in sales. Among the new rumors is the fear that the Nepalese workers that are due to arrive may carry the Coronavirus. The regional Police Inspector and the official organization for discrimination open up an investigation for acts of fear and hatred mongering and discrimination. One of the bakers cries after seeing on the news locals declaring that the fact they're black is the problem.
**02.02**: President of the Cluj County Council (a neighboring county, Ditrău is located in Harghita county) says he will do whatever he can to offer the bakers new jobs, should they have to leave the bakery for good. The Ditrău priest doubles down; says he'll be assuming the consequences for not following the Archbishop's request to not get involved, and doesn't regret taking position against the bakers. The bakery owner changes his mind and says he'll keep the bakers making bread because he needs bakers. Adds that the locals are welcome to apply as bakers, but reminds then that he's been looking to fill these positions for months unsuccessfully, which is why he's resorted to recruiting abroad. The Minister of Work makes a statement; points out that Romanians work abroad and that the locals should be more accepting of foreigners who come to work here. Says that the decision to keep on the bakers ultimately rests with the bakery owner, since it's a privately-owned business. Rareș Bogdan (PNL), member of the European Parliament for Romania, makes a statement; warns that this case will definitely be a problem for Romania, particularly unwelcome during a time when 800,000 Romanians are to be affected by Brexit. He accuses the Fidesz party from Hungary of ""hatred rethoric"", which reaches the locals of Ditrău because they follow the Duna and Hir TV stations.
* **03.02**: The bakers' relatives back in Sri Lanka reach out to see if they're alright after hearing news of the discrimination. Both the Romanian and the Sri Lankan recruitment companies that facilitated their employment in Romania would be held directly responsible if something were to happen to them. The average Sri Lanka salary is 70 USD/mo, in Romania the bakers get $480/mo, their rent is covered, and so are the flights to Romania and back home. The Romanian company says it's the first time they've had to deal with such an extremist reaction, having brought in 10,000 workers from India and Nepal over the last 13 years. This has been their first attempt to place workers in the Harghita county and Sri Lanka is a recent addition to their services. There are 100,000 immigrants in Romania (population 18 mil.), of which 60% are from outside the EU.
* **04.02**: As a result of the investigations the bakery has been fined 2000€ for improperly grounded electrical equipment. No other problems have been found so far, but the Police and Work Ministry investigations are still ongoing. The bakery owner had submitted a request to join as affected part in the criminal investigation file opened by the Police on the counts of hatred mongering, threats, disturbance of public order, and organizing with xenophobic and racist intent.
* **04.02** In the city of Cluj, a restaurant has hired 22 people from Sri Lanka. The people in the neighborhood where the workers have been hosted have started harassing the owner and submitting complaints mentioning ""dark-skinned foreigners of unknown status"". Other similar cases of harassment of Asian workers have come to light in Vâlcea and Bucharest as well.

5356,"&gt; 80% of the fish brought back to IJmuiden comes from the waters surrounding Britain.

The relative importance of of UK waters to the Netherlands is estimated to be around 34%. Highest percentage of importance of UK waters to EU-27 members is for Belgium, which is about 50% relative importance (Belgium is worth about 9% of total EU-27 catches in UK waters). Lowest is Spain, which is 2% dependant [1].

&gt;  it's rather difficult when you're only allocated a minimal percentage and face strict regulation while the lion's share of fish stocks goes to France

Those quota's are based on historic precedence, so if the UK could only fish a small amount of a particular species, it is because, traditionally, it didn't do much of that anyway.

Not to mention that the UK already sets its own national quota's that limit how much other countries can catch in its waters as well.

In total, that lion's share of fish caught by EU-27 in UK waters is estimated at 687 tons (33,7% of total fish caught, 25.4% of the total value). 32,5% of that is caught by France. [2]

&gt; Brexit will affect this massively in future with the Dutch facing significant losses that won't be replaced so easily.

Certainly, 34% is quite a lot assuming no access to UK waters at all. Relatively though, the economic importance of fishery to the EU however is relatively low. Certainly, some countries will care more than others, but even then (like with the UK) the importance  of fishery is more cultural than economical.

&gt; So yes, with the massive amount of job losses facing various EU countries ... it's very much an outcome that the EU desperately wanted to avoid.

Again, economically, the fishing industry is hardly as big as Brexit has made it out to be, either in the EU *or* the UK. Most of any potential job losses on either side won't be within the fisheries.

&gt; If Europe doesn't play nicely, your fishing industries will have a very hard time in future and people unable to enjoy as much fresh seafood

That cuts both ways. The EU is worth about 70% of the UK's export, with France alone being worth 25% [3]. So if the UK wants to play hard your fishing industry will have a hard time selling its fish.

There is no government action that you can name that can't be corrupted - not private market action either. So then the only reasonable course of action is not to do anything.

&gt;Don't get me wrong: I'm not a climate change denier or some shit like that. But it's absurd to argue that cost of energy economy measures does not fall on the consumer and that it does not target the poorest disproportionally.

That is potentially true, but I offered you several proposals how to avoid it. You ignore those and prefer to complain rather than trying to solve the problem.

&gt;So to support the half-baked, half-brained and all-ineffective schemes like meat tax, forced insulation utt., while nobody has the balls to tackle the real reasons and main culprits, is both hypocritical and inhumane, IMHO.

Please say who ""the real culprits"" are and how you are going to ""tackle"" them.

They're not forced.

5423,"&gt; Nice strawman, I have never said that ""my personal taste pleasure is more important than a stable climate"", all I said that you simply cannot put animal life equal to human life.

That's the premise behind your argument though: I like meat and that's more important than the climate.

&gt;Also, if you actually want to save the climate, why not go for fossil fuels instead?

What do you mean, ""instead""? There's no reason that we can't make changes in two sectors at the same time. Moreover, we'll have to tackle all sources of emissions, so naturally those measures will *also* be needed.

&gt;Carbon and methane released by cows are part of the CO2 cycle and does not effect the environment seriously

There is no observable difference between methane and carbon dioxide released by cows or released by fossil fuels. They will all, eventually, be incorporated back into the biosphere, but as it is the pace of emission is simply too high for the environment to absorb.

Furthermore, that's only true insofar it's about bovines in their natural environment, and most meat is factory farmed. The good news is that farming practices that actually sequester carbon can get carbon credits similar to those of renewable energy to trade on the emission market, offsetting the increased tax. Factory farmed meat will still feel the full tax. Then again, the same land likely will sequester more carbon if managed as woodland or something like it. Bottom line, there will be some space for meat cultivation in the picture, but the emissions must be justified and offset. It's likely that you can still have meat on festive occasions, just not for daily meals.

There is *some* absorption capacity still - just not by far enough for all the things we are doing. Putting a price on the carbon emissions allows us to choose and pick on what we choose to spend our limited emission allowance: some people will prefer to eat meat occasionally, others will want to take a plane once or twice. And as always, if the price of carbon emitting products becomes higher, that means there's a market for alternatives. If technological solutions are found there's no reason not to have the same services. Those won't be taxed.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/eyw1wx/eu_urged_to_adopt_meat_tax_to_tackle_climate/fgu1cvt/,silverionmox,1581111990

This is why the choice has to be made on sovereignty and why the UK voted to leave - because it feared becoming just a 'State' of the EU.

You simply cannot have a unitary policy body (farm policy *or* defense policy) without subordinating constituents to decision making, and you cannot fund implementation without a central financial authority.

For a USE to work, Germany and Romania need to *cease* to be sovereign countries, their 'national banks' need to *cease* to be independent of an ECB, and ultimately, their militaries need to be under the control of Brussels, just as the US Armed Forces are ultimately answerable to Washington D.C., at the funding of Congress and the order of the President.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/f0hdbn/eu_goes_into_meeting_frenzy_ahead_of_february_20/fgu1nv9/,lost_snake,1581112133

5441,"I don’t think you truly understand the data you’re reading....there is no overproduction in the EU, or at least nothing significant anyway...your original comment is wrong, or based on an incorrect understanding of the data.

The difference between production and consumption is not “overproduction”, that is a poor understanding of the electricity market.

What you should be looking at is [this data for 2017](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Simplified_balance_for_electricity_and_derived_heat,_EU-28,_2017_(thousand_tonnes_of_oil_equivalent).png):

* Electricity production (you’ll find it in the “Electricity &amp; Heat production” row) - 283,68 million tonnes of oil equivalent or almost exactly 3.300TWh
* Electricity consumption (you’ll find it in the “Final energy consumption” row) - 240,585 million tonnes of oil equivalent or almost 2.800TWh

The difference between production and consumption (around 500TWh) is not because of “overproduction”, but because you totally ignored the self-consumption of the generating capacity (the generating capacity itself, the power plants, use some of the electricity produced; you’ll find it in the “Consumption of the energy branch” row), which is equal to 21,075 million tonnes of oil equivalent or 245TWh. You also ignored the distribution losses (aptly named “Distribution losses” row), which are equal to 17,736 million tonnes of oil equivalent or 206TWh. When you sum those two together you get 38,811 million tonnes of oil equivalent or 451TWh, which almost covers the entire 500TWh difference between production and consumption. The rest (less than 50TWh) are mostly covered by the statistical differences (14TWh), approximations, and what not, and by a possible “overproduction”.

There is no other “overproduction”. The overproduction, if there is any, is guaranteed to be less than 35TWh, which is barely above 1% of production, so statistically almost irrelevant.

What’s more, an increase in renewables by default lowers the self-consumption of the generating capacity (so the biggest contributor to the difference between production and consumption), because renewables require much less self-consumption to function. And while distributed grids for renewables could increase distribution losses, they could also decrease them (a household with solar panels on its roof won’t need to transmit that electricity for even short distances, it is consumed locally, lowering transmission losses).

So the entire premise of your comments is wrong.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/ezs9nh/eus_co2_emissions_fall_12_in_2019_as_wind_and/fgu1vwt/,Etain05,1581112238

Technically it was only the New Territories which were ""leased"" out for 99 years. The island of Hong Kong was ceded in perpetuity to the UK. Hong Kong was given back with the New Territories, as Hong Kong was dependent on the New Territories by 1997.

How the UK messed up was getting involved in two costly global wars in close succession; which meant the UK had lost all it's power when the lease ended. If the UK had still had its military might in 1997, the 99-year lease would have been extended.

That is a tremendous percentage and as for not fishing it ourselves, it's rather difficult when you're only allocated a minimal percentage and face strict regulation while the lion's share of fish stocks goes to France, Spain and whatever EU country fancies our resources?

Brexit will affect this massively in future with the Dutch facing significant losses that won't be replaced so easily. Instead of buying back our own fish from you lot, Britain may enjoy the prospect of revived coastal towns; Grimbsy in particular took a huge battering (pun not intended) when the EU set about crippling our fishing industries and outsourcing our considerable fishing stocks to enrich your countries at our loss.

So yes, with the massive amount of job losses facing various EU countries that did profit handsomely from British resources while our hands were tied, it's very much an outcome that the EU desperately wanted to avoid. If Europe doesn't play nicely, your fishing industries will have a very hard time in future and people unable to enjoy as much fresh seafood, but there's a deal the EU just made with Vietnam! Maybe you can enjoy their sewer fish like we've had to make do with 50 years ever since the EU seized our waters. Personally I'm looking forward to new local seafood at much more reasonable prices in future.

5651,"That would kill the EU completely I think. Smaller countries are already tired of others running the show but if they don't even have a veto deal, they're no longer a sovereign country at all, they're just a vassal of Germany/France and nothing else. No one wants that... Well, besides Germany and France perhaps.

The veto thing ensures that others can't just run things for you to some extent which appeases the more skeptic people for the most part.

EU is supposed to be a cooperation, if people don't agree then you don't cooperate on that issue. That's exactly how it should be and how it is in this situation. France, Germany etc. can still condemn Israel or whatever they want to do, but they just don't get to do it through EU to make it sound scarier. Everything doesn't have to be an EU-action, you can still do a Germany-action, a France-action, a Germany-and-France-action etc. without needing it to be something representing all of EU.

There's no requirement to agree on everything just to be in EU, what you're suggesting is totalitarian bullshit being forced upon countries that don't agree. I don't have to agree with Hungary, Austria, Spain or whatever to respect their right to disagree with me and my country. If they disagree with me that's perfectly fine and of course I (or my country) shouldn't be able to force other countries to do stuff they disagree with. Not everything is in the best interest of everyone. Something can be in the interest of Germany and not in the interest of Spain for example, then it makes sense that Germany is for it and that Spain is against it.

She has been enjoying massive confidence since she came into office and has been the most popular politician since 2005 and is even popular outside her own party. You also have to consider that she's been there for 15 years and many people don't even know a time without Merkel or can't remember anyone else being Chancellor, like myself. The overall CDU popularity has gone down since Merkel left as party leader, but it's unclear how that turned off young voters. We have to wait and see in the next election.

While the main demographic of the CDU are mainly old people, they are still the most voted party among people below 30.

What makes you think I am not taking that into account? People can be victims and criminals at the same time. They can be abusers and the abused. Soviets saved people from Nazis and, at the same time, mass-murdered others. 

&gt; And calling Islamic State and jihadists right wing and conservatives, that’s perverted left wing propaganda. 

Don't be so triggered about it - the values of the jihadists, as I said, are **extremelly traditionalist**, emphasizing a hegemonic religion, *very* clear gender norms and roles up to segregation of genders, and an authoritarian societies with corporal punishments.

5770,"&gt;She is a ''victim'' in the aspect that her social upbringing/environment led her down this route/allowed her access to it.

So a person whose family enforces him to go to art school and learn that and becomes an artist in 5 years instead of a firemen as he wanted to be when he was 9 is also a victim ? 

After all it was his upbringing and environment leading him down that path.

And well if he says he likes being an artist now we can clearly establish that he's been brainwashed.

&gt;Her being a ''victim'' doesn't mean she's innocent of the things she did in ISIS - but her getting married to a Dutch jihadi in Syria, becoming a child birthing machine and then having her children die - yeah, I'd classify it as partially as being a ''victim''.

Because all of those things happened to her through her own choices.  If I take a pair of pliers and cut of my finger, am I the victim and pliers the offending party ?  Can I sue the pliers ? 

It's hard to make the case that she should be morally sympathized with as a victim. 


&gt;Heavily islamic environments are extremelly conservative, so I don't get your point. Extreme gender norms and gender roles, segregation of people, religious dogmatism. Christian fanatics right now simply lack the violent death-cult expressions of their faith, however you can see elements of this in IIRC Africa, where Evangelists are brainwashing Africans into a very conservative religious dogma. 

Because conservative christian societies do not espouse the same values islamic conservatice societies.  It's that simple.

You want to make the case that conservatism is bad at the core, which is simply not true, and I won't play that game.


&gt;The book in question is irrelevant as much as the fact that her upbringing was clearly detrimental for her mental health - maybe it was insecurity coupled with religious extremism - to the extent she was willing to go to the caliphate. Not all fundamentalist muslims went to ISIS, not all women that were targeted by ISIS groomers went to ISIS - it was a specific combination of characteristics that led her to going to Syria when she was 15.

Who are you to make this claim ? Expert on her mental health ? She would not be the first nor the last to make those decisions of entirely sound mind.

&gt;What's your point here? That she's a colossally huge piece of shit? Or is this a hurr-durr migrant diversity LOL thing?

No my point is thats where she stops being the victim. She might have been the victim at 15 when she was I take it seduced by a dutch terrorist, though that's debatable as well. She wouldn't be the first 15 year old hounding an older guy. We're don't know the full story and I suspect nobody ever will. 

&gt;First of all, her actions did have consequences - she literally lost three of her children. I don't know about you, but I'd say that losing your children is an absolutely horrible consequence of your actions. She also, no matter what, will probably have to deal with the judicial consequences of joining a terrorist organization.

As much as those are moral consequences, they are not legal ones. And she does not seem particularly dissuaded by them.

&gt;Second of all, I don't want punitive measures post-factum, after all cuttings hands off of thieves doesn't remove the conditions that make people steal. I want to prevent people from joining these death cults in the first place, or, if they exhibit signs of wanting to join them, help them avoid it. She was 15 when she joined ISIS, after all, so I doubt that the actual legitimacy of her strong religious convictions - she could have, possibly, been saved from everything that happened to her.

Ah that's just not true. We have the term crimes of opportunity for a reason, and most theft is among those. Even people who don't need to steal, steal a neighbours amazon package. Because they saw an opportunity and are a giant piece of shit, not because they need it, they don't even know what it is in most cases.

As for the second part, sure we completely  agree on that. There needs to be more work done on preventing people from falling into these traps.  However I disagree that punitive measures don't do anything to dissuade people from that, they do. A combination is the best.  Also you will never be able to eliminate all conditions for the table, and those on the fence to commit a crime so to speak will be dissuaded by the fact they'll get punished if they do it, as opposed to nothing happening if they do it and get caught.

While it was previously believed that most elicit activity was quarantined in the Overseas territories and crown dominions, we now know that over 30 thousand companies have shells in the UK proper used to hide money. This is second only to British Virgin Islands (as far as the Panama Papers go)

5793,"&gt; Die Linke hiring ex-Stasi operatives (like Torsten Koplin), 

Oh fucking lol. The very first party leader of Thuringias CDU, Uwe Ehrich, was an informal worker (""IM"") for the Stasi. So was Josef Duchač (CDU), first minister-president of Thuringia. Fact is that in the DDR, the party and state police pervaded all of society and many ordinary people for many ordinary reasons participated and collaborated with the state and the Stasi, often enough by providing little but the most innocuous information. It's historically daft and inappropriate to proclaim undifferentiated judgment over everyone somehow involved with this process.

The CDUs DDR past according to Historian [Thorsten Holzhauser](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2020-01/die-linke-thueringen-cdu-sed-vergangenheit), University of Erfurt: 

&gt;[...]It is clear that the GDR was not a constitutional state, and today a majority of the Left Party sees it that way.  It is more difficult with the word unjust state, which causes great contradiction in the party and its electorate. Admittedly, this also occurs in the last red-red-green coalition agreement in Thuringia. But that does not yet make it an internal party consensus. The Left Party has also tended to communicate this as a concession to the coalition partners. And Ramelow himself put the term into perspective during the last election campaign. 

&gt;ZEIT ONLINE: The East CDU, which later merged with the CDU, helped to stabilize the SED regime in the GDR. How did the CDU deal with its own past?

&gt;Holzhauser: For a long time, this past was rather concealed than dealt with - not least because of the demonstrative demarcation from the PDS and the Left.

&gt;ZEIT ONLINE: Would you say that the Left stands by the Federal Republic's democracy today or does it want to fundamentally change the system?

&gt;Holzhauser: I see no signs in today's Left Party that it is concerned with abolishing democracy or returning to the communism of the GDR. But the party has always maintained its claim to overcome the capitalist system of the Federal Republic. In this respect, the party remains critical of the system, which I also consider legitimate. Where the party has been involved in government in recent decades, however, there has never been much evidence of such an anti-capitalist overcoming of the system. The Left is implementing social democratic policies in East Germany. This forces the CDU to justify itself. It cannot explain why it can form a coalition with an SPD under Saskia Esken, but not with a Left Party under Bodo Ramelow.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/f0b9u9/after_the_government_crisis_in_thuringia_first/fgsrzj2/,Bojarow,1581091406

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union#The_British_and_Polish_protocol

&gt;In the negotiations leading up to the signing to the Lisbon Treaty, Poland and the United Kingdom secured a protocol to the treaty relating to the application of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights in their respective countries.

&gt;The protocol, in article 1(1) states that the ""Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or actions of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms."" Article 1(2) then says that the Title IV of the Charter, which contains economic and social rights, does not create justiciable rights, unless Poland and the UK have provided for such rights in their national laws. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union_%E2%80%93_Poland

&gt;Although not a full opt-out, both Poland and former member state the United Kingdom secured a protocol which clarified how the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, a part of the Treaty of Lisbon, would interact with national law in their countries limiting the extent that European courts would be able to rule on issues related to the Charter if they are brought to courts in Poland or the UK.[16] Poland's then ruling party, Law and Justice, mainly noted concerns that it might force Poland to grant homosexual couples the same kind of benefits which heterosexual couples enjoy,[17] while the UK was worried that the Charter might be used to alter British labour law, especially as relates to allowing more strikes.[18]",Poland,/r/europe/comments/f09zc7/optouts_in_the_european_union/fgsfo1k/,vytah,1581083038
