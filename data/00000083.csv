Novgorod is located in the northern region, where there are many forests and swamps. In such a place, it is difficult to conduct full-scale hostilities. 

Until the 15th century, the walls were stone (and even earlier wooden) - then the city was attacked by the Swedes and there were several attempts to take the city by the Livonian Order. After the wall became brick, it wasn’t attacked, but Novgorod was for some time in the Swedish occupation in the 1610s.

Peter the Great also expected the siege of Novgorod by the Swedes during the Great Northern War, but this did not happen.",Moscow,/r/europe/comments/hm2j9b/novgorod_kremlin_russia_1480s_built/fx36k03/,IvanMironov,1594032985

1) Fethullah Gulen is actually influenced by a Kurdish cleric called Said-i Kurdi(Nursi). However, when that cleric was arrested and Fethullah was invited to visit him, Fethullah refused because he greatly dislikes Kurds. 

2-) FETO movement was strongest among low class white Turks.

3-) They organised witch hunts against Kurds. While they hit military with Ergenekon, they also attacked Kurdish activists with KCK trials. Of course military man all released now but alleged KCK members still inside. 

4-) They were against Turkey-PKK peace deal. They leaked Oslo recordings and tried to arrest Hakan Fidan, head of MİT.

5-) They push for something called Turkish-Islam synthesis which unites turkish ultranationalism with Islam. This was pushed in Turkey after 80 coup.

In the beginning of the 20th century the crises capitalism inherently and regularly produces became so severe that they would've finally destroyed capitalism. However, this was prevented by state intervention and bailing out big companies, which has become the Modus Operandi for all following economic crises, including the current one. Today, a capitalist market free of state intervention (Including bailouts) and regulations would collapse within the next crisis.

And the regulated capitalism that we have is also wearing thin. One day, there won't be anything left for the state to privatise to get money for bailouts and repay debts. Economic inequality is skyrocketing everywhere, as productivity and profits steadily rise and wages have remained largely the same for decades. Work is considered less valuable than owning property, although only the former actually creates value and contributes to society. Landlords and entrepeneurs are parasites.

Finally, we claim to live in an oh-so-great democracy, yet we spend a third of the day toiling away in private autocracies and oligarchies where we have next to no representation, and the political system's democracy is compromised by private lobbying and the inability to remove unreliable representatives.

Since the mid-20th century particularly, after Nigeria gained independence, many modern Nigerian immigrants have come to the United States to pursue educational opportunities in undergraduate and post-graduate institutions. In the 1960s and 1970s after the Biafra War, Nigeria's government funded scholarships for Nigerian students, and many of them were admitted to American universities. While this was happening, there were several military coups, interspersed with brief periods of civilian rule. The instability resulted in many Nigerian professionals emigrating, especially doctors, lawyers and academics, who found it difficult to return to Nigeria.*

 Even though the employer had every day left many hours unpaid (...)

  The cleaners were told that if they worked hard and without complaining, they would get a residence permit based on their job.  Since that moment Ibrahem had to work seven days a week. (...)

The work could take days. It was done around the clock, through the night up until the morning.

If the employer gave them permission to rest, Ibrahem and the rest of the cleaners slept at the workplace.

They  found a corner and crawled up on the floor for a few hours. One slept  in the gymnasium, another in a classroom. Some fell asleep on the table  or the couch.

Some were so tired that they fell asleep sitting down.(...)

 Many cleaning companies essentially base their business model on the exploitation of workers.  

The scale of exploitation is  large. At worst conditions are inhumane and reminiscent of human  trafficking. Human trafficking means that the perpetrator takes control  of the victim by using their vulnerable position, for the purpose of  forcing them to, for example, work.

Exploitation  also means workers cleaning a grocery store for six hours a day and  only getting paid for two. Or cleaning a fast food place at night with  no pay. Or working for a few weeks as a real estate cleaner and, after  asking for salary, getting tossed out.

In  its least serious form exploitation can mean different kinds of unjust  working conditions, where the employer takes advantage of the workers’  weak position. That is what’s going on when, for example, a large  Finnish cleaning company is constantly slightly underpaying its foreign  cleaners.",,/r/europe/comments/hltkgp/a_dirty_business_immigrants_clean_schools/fx30000/,talures,1594026265

167,"No coal, no uranium, that leaves you with (wind + gas).

Better that coal, sure, still not carbon-neutral.

&gt;Nuclear is also very expensive

The economics of energy are rather complicated, starting with the fact that, absent energy, there wouldn't be much of an economy to speak of.

The true cost of energy does not immediately translate in monetary terms. Most of the gas and petroleum we burn in Europe come from countries that are not specially friendly, and this has a diplomatic price too.

Now, the costliest componant of a nuclear powerplant is the interests of the initial loan, which varies greatly depending on who the borrower is. Almost free is state-backed. Of course, a small company can't aford those. Nuclear is expensive only for *small time investors eager to rake a quike ROI*, and I won't trust the climate of my planet to those.

&gt;and unflexibel.

Nuclear reactors are quite dispatchable. How do you think they [follow the power call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_following_power_plant#Nuclear_power_plants) in France ?

Using NPPs for baseload was perfectly justified if and when your grid comprises *other dispatchable* sources, traditionally coal, then oil and now gas. In a few countries like Sweden, Switzerland or Brazil, this can also be hydro.

197,"&gt;\[...\] with Germany essentially having no foreign policy to speak of \[...\]

Intresting point which doesnt get carried out more, because I dont see it.

Germany is following , for decades now, an approach of foreign policies of multilateralism. To incorporate even rivals in a international framework of rules, which everybody has to follow, or fear retaliation of everyone.

I know that ""America First"" is a more catchy phrase to make international policies, but is it better?

&gt;An economic giant, Germany is a strategic dwarf whose inability and unwillingness to project hard power \[...\]

Yes, I cant disagree on this one. But, German politicans are well aware of the fact, that a strong German military isnt much appreciated with its neighbours. There is some bad history in this point.

So I think, espacially in this point, that Germany should abolish their blocking behaviour on EU level, but should give France the precedence, in leading the EU block into a strong hard power.

&gt;\[...\] Russia’s strategic influence is great. I will therefore continue to strive for cooperation. 

Is there any doubt about this?

Germany does prolong the trade retaliation against Russia because of Crimea together with the whole EU block.

But yes, Russia is still a global player, and a direct neighbour to EU territories. So we cant cut speaking with Russia. And we need to be cautious, not to do more damage than good.

&gt;\[...\] Germany’s increasingly self-confident eastern EU neighbours, allowing the US to play European countries against each other, \[...\]

So thats a fault of Germany too? Just asking ... 

&gt;\[...\] Hopes that a China-EU trade deal would be finally signed this year, replacing the unbalanced economic relationship \[...\]

As said in my first point, this is exactly the thing. Germany try to 'force' China into a multilateral framwork of rules.

President Emmanuel Macron insists Paris has now adopted a neutral stance and that it fully supports the UN-supported peace process in Libya agreed by international powers in January. But some suggest the claimed recalibration and the French criticism of Ankara have more to do with the Tripoli government’s success since April in repelling Mr Haftar’s offensive, with the help of weapons and mercenaries sent by Turkey.

“The French have realised Haftar has become a liability and not an asset any more,” one veteran western diplomat says of the French position. “I believe they are embarrassed because once again they made a mistake. Faced with this mistake, they have to justify it and they blame Turkey.”

The dispute highlights tensions between European powers embroiled in Libya since its descent into chaos after a Nato bombing campaign led by Britain and France helped oust Muammer Gaddafi in 2011.

Let’s be honest, Turkey stopped the fall of Tripoli. Without their intervention, it would have been a humanitarian disaster

A senior European diplomat
France’s decision to align with Gen Haftar’s backers, notably the United Arab Emirates, reflects its preoccupation with protecting commercial stakes in the oil industry and fighting Islamist terrorism in the Sahel, said Tarek Megerisi, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

“France has different interests to Germany and Italy in Libya and it has moved to protect these interests,” Mr Megerisi said. “It has security interests in the Sahel and a wider security partnership that it is building with the United Arab Emirates — and in which Egypt is a big part.”

Last week, France suspended its involvement in a Nato mission off Libya’s coast, amid what it claimed was the hostile behaviour of Turkish warships. Florence Parly, France’s defence minister, addressing the EU parliament, said Turkey’s actions were “unworthy of a Nato ally”.

Ankara denies the allegations, which are the subject of a classified report by Nato military authorities due to be discussed by alliance member states soon.

France has also criticised Turkey over its drilling for hydrocarbon reserves in waters off Cyprus and its military incursion into northern Syria last year. Mr Macron railed that Nato was suffering “brain death” because of its lack of a co-ordinated response to Ankara’s Syria move.

France is not the only Nato member unhappy with Turkey, which is the target of — largely symbolic — EU sanctions over the Mediterranean drilling. Ankara’s decision to buy an S-400 air defence system from Russia led to its expulsion last year from Nato’s F-35 stealth fighter jet programme.

But French vitriol at Ankara over Libya — where Mr Macron has described Turkey’s actions as “criminal” — is questioned by European diplomats who do not see the situation as so clear-cut.

Ankara’s dispatch of weapons — including Turkish-made armed drones — to the north African country as well as military advisers and several thousand Syrian mercenary fighters made a crucial difference in fending off Gen Haftar’s siege of Tripoli in the past few months. Gen Haftar had appeared in the ascendancy as he enjoyed the backing of the UAE, Egypt and Russia. His forces are supported by Russian, Sudanese and Syrian mercenaries.

“Let’s be honest, Turkey stopped the fall of Tripoli,” said a senior European diplomat. “Without their intervention, it would have been a humanitarian disaster.”

Foreign policy analysts say France overplayed its hand in championing Gen Haftar as a strongman whom it could control in the traditions of its postcolonial Africa policy — and was then shocked when Turkey intervened to support the government in Tripoli.

When Gen Haftar launched an offensive in south Libya at the beginning of last year that preceded his attack on the capital, France publicly supported him. The foreign backing was considered to have at very least emboldened him to launch his assault on Tripoli. Months later, US-made Javelin missiles, purchased by France, were discovered by Libyan government forces after they seized one of Gen Haftar’s camps.

Libya oil chief says foreign powers hampering efforts to end embargo

 “There was a sort of strategic panic” among French officials when its policy of backing Mr Haftar as someone who would curb Islamist militants in north Africa went wrong, said Dorothée Schmid, a Middle East expert at Ifri, the French foreign relations institute.

Although Gen Haftar has had strong support from Russia, the UAE and Egypt — all of whom have been accused of violating the arms embargo on Libya — France has struggled to find support for its confrontational approach from its Nato and European allies. Other European states view the Libyan strongman as the aggressor and the main barrier to a political resolution.

“France is rather isolated in this affair,” Ms Schmid said. “And everyone is waiting for the American elections.” 

Mr Macron has instead struck up a close relationship with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, crown prince of Abu Dhabi and de facto leader of the UAE. The Gulf state is one of Gen Haftar’s staunchest backers and Sheikh Mohammed and Mr Macron discussed the Libyan crisis last month, reiterating calls for a ceasefire.

But diplomats fear all sides in the Libyan conflict are mobilising. The UAE has increasingly toxic relations with Turkey and accuses Ankara of supporting Islamist groups and being a malign force in the Arab world.

Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s state minister for foreign affairs, said last month that on Libya the Gulf state did not act alone. “We are part of a group of countries that see eye-to-eye on the situation, particularly with France and Egypt,” he said. “We had a major concern with groups like Aqap [a Yemen-based al-Qaida affiliate] and Isis converging on Libya. This has kept us involved in Libya.”

224,"It's stupid to narrow the yugo war only down to what went down in Bosnia. But anyway, what I think is different from yugo war with current problems cited there is that there is genuinely no possibility to stop China from slaying uyghurs, or similar stuff. They are inpenetrable, they have endless military resource, and since they don't threat any foreign countries there is no incentive for anyone to try and stop it. Or if there were, it's not feasible.


""helping"" to resolve the yugo war was doable, the scale of the conflict wasn't overly big compared to the war against isis for example.


Neither side in the conflict really has an actual big military force, nor military resource compared to nato.

And in that war it was a free for all, everyone fighting everyone. Not secluded forces like ISIS devoted to their demise and training solely to fight.

Not so much the case with current issues.

230,"No, just no, he represents neo-libereal political party that wants to keep wages low. Did you even look at his program, there is nothing there about helping poorere people at best he wants to maintain 500+ and he only is doing that to not lose chance at being president if he said he wants to scrap it he would definitly not win, same reason he claimed he supported keeping retirment age lower.

Lets also mention the fact that he is willing to lie directly into people faces to win, like for example he talked some time ago that if he become president he would stop construction of central communication hub and that money that was going to be used on its construction should be used to help people and companies dealing with corona virus crisis, sounds good right ? people when asked about it were quite supportive of this idea, so whats the problem  ? the problem is that money CANT actually be used that way, money would mostly come from inveestors and railroad section would be financed from the EU so he either planned to steal investor money and misuse EU money which I find unlikely or he was simply lying to people to gain their support.

I dont really have faith in him he would be good president, not after  goat scandal in warsaw, the whole thing about goats dying on small island on the river, I am bit lazy so I will quote someone who know this topic well: ""Warsaw town hall had been running an ecological scheme of allowing 60 goats to graze on the island in order to keep the grass short.

The next only-in-Warsaw moment came when I found out more:

The authorities were paying the owner of the goats 12,000 zł per months for keeping the goats there. It’s about 3000 euros per month.

This is a lot of money in Poland, 4x an average wage. Only the Warsaw town hall could come up with such a scheme, I thought.

Then it came out that the owner was paying a homeless man to look after the goats, paying him 50zł and a packet of frankfurters per month. It’s equivalent to 11 euros per month.

What? The Warsaw town hall would go into a contract with a shady goat owner like this?

I hope it couldn’t happen anywhere else. Only in Warsaw.

Then the goats started dying. Animal Rescue services were alerted by a passer by. Out of 60 goats expected there, they found 30, 18 in a critical condition. They all needed urgent medical attention. The missing 30 were dead.

The homeless man on the island was ordered by the owner to bury the dead goats, without reporting it to the authorities. He also threw some carcasses into the river, which could have caused an epidemiological danger.

I couldn’t believe that something like this could happen in Warsaw. I do hope it couldn’t happen anywhere else.

it turned out that the owner didn’t live, and didn’t have a business, at the addresses which he gave to the authorities of the town hall.

The Warsaw town hall was paying regularly to a guy they didn’t verify.

The goat owner, Rustam Khaybulaew from Dagestan. 

Another aspect of it is that in Poland polygamy is illegal. And yet he arrived first as a refugee and then brought over all his wives under “family reunification”. I can’t quite see how he could justify all these wives to the authorities.""",,/r/europe/comments/hlm4ic/do_you_wanna_know_how_close_the_polish/fx2t9pn/,Culaio,1594019540

Sufice to say when exit pools came out everyone was shocked. There are 3 reasons given atm. Firstly the leader of main oposition SDP is percived as uncharismatic and incapable of being a leader, on the other hand leader of HDZ is percived as charismatic, not corrupted unlike his party and influental in EU.

HDZ recived praise with handling of economic crisis and praise on handling of covid spread until 2nd wave 2 weeks ago. It seems people would a lot rather see capable, charismatic leader of HDZ running the contury during these times. Slogan of the party played on this, it was ""Safe Croatia"" .

On the other left-green coalition had great campaign fueled by media atention after Zagreb earthquake. The mayor of the capital was under pressure of corruption charges, incompetence and botched earthquake reaction. Zagreb mayor was also ex SDP member and political ""godfather"" of SDP's leader political career. Leftists outpreformed the expected 3-4 seats with 7 nationaly. Before election they were projected 1 seat in Zagreb but they won 3. Also since Zagreb  suburbs are part of 3 more different election districts, it pulled them up in those 3 districts giving them 1 seat in each.

398,"&gt; According to the first graph of my link, the demographic inertia has been spent as of 2016.

I see the graph, but I don't see why it would show that.

You're looking at the orange line going down, yes?  My point is that over time, the downwards slope of that line is expected increase from where it is today.  The reason that the slope is not steeper than would otherwise be the case is because inertia from past higher fertility rates continues to support it.

I'm not saying that the slope of the red line is upwards.

&gt; Remember, in most places in Europe TFR dipped below replacement level in the 60’s.

I'm not saying that the TFR is at a sustainable level today.  Rather, that past higher TFRs are still affecting the rate of population change.  They will continue to do so until a lifetime has passed, so that the birth-to-death ratio is no longer affected.

&gt; If anything, this inertia will now work in the opposite way, as generations of sub replacement fertility mean that even if we magically increase TFR to 2.1, the natural rate of population growth will be negative due to the lagging effect.

Yes, that is true — if you bring up TFR, effect of rate of population size change will also be delayed in the other direction, as current low levels drag it down for a lifetime.  My point is just that past high TFRs are still supporting the rate of population growth and will do so for some time.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hlk8b3/from_1965_to_2016_the_marriage_rate_in_the_eu/fx2pj22/,duisThias,1594016154

408,"&gt; I didn't bring it up, you did.

Yes, as an ill-considered waste of money, which is relevant to my point. You call it the foundation of early rocketry, space flight, ballistic missiles, ICBM and SLBM, but so what? The Germans didn't have a payload to make it worth the while for any military application, they sure weren't building any moon bases for Mecha-Hitler, the payoff was by any standard not worth the astounding costs and you have to wonder why no one bothered to point this out sooner.

Note the dates on your quotes in the late 20s and early 1930s. There was quite a lot of development in the science between then and the late 1930s which made it a great deal more plausible, Einstein got pushed into writing the letter by Szilard who was able to set up a bunch of subcritical multiplication in a straightforward experiment shortly after he'd first heard about fission being achieved... that immediately made the process by far less fanciful, and the various nuclear physicists in the US were able to argue their case strongly enough to get the government to actually buy in on it and give them a practically unlimited budget and manpower for the benefits.

&gt; I think it's hypocritical to mock programs like the V-2 while simultaneously berate Germany for not supplying enormous amounts of money and devote manpower for other costly programs that, with the benefit of hindsight, would have been beneficial.

To be honest I think that the German nuclear program was enough of a trainwreck that it wouldn't have gotten much more progress on a substantially higher budget versus spending on more practical things but if you hear the pitch for an atom bomb and the V-2 rocket and decide that the later is the more sagacious use of all the money to birth, you have a problem.

&gt; German scientists were not pseudo-scientists who believed in magic or whatever ""aryan science"" is.

471,"I'd say that you're both partly right and both partly wrong.

A good deal of colonization -- and as far as I know, all colonization during the Industrial Era -- did involve trade.  It didn't just involve simply enslaving the locals and taking things at the point of a gun.  Rather, raw resources were traded for, and processed goods from an industrialized country sold back into the market.

However, it's also true that the trade was typically not free -- that is, the aim was to constrain the country in question to trade principally or at all with the mother country and to extract wealth via having higher prices due to that monopoly than would exist under free trade.

That is, what had happened was that European powers had benefited from being the first countries in the world to industrialize.  There was a finite world market for manufactured goods, and a finite amount of resources to process.  So the era can be seen as something of countries who had run into a new set of technology fighting over exclusive control over shares of that market.

I don't particularly think that there's much likelihood of the world reverting to the way it worked in a pre-industrial era, nor that the US was the dominant factor in changing that -- the underlying change was rather the spread of technology.

* The technological disparity that allowed countries to be militarily-controlled by one empire was diminishing.  It wasn't a bunch of guys with spears against a bunch of guys with guns any more.
    
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun
    
    &gt; The Maxim gun was first used by Britain's colonial forces in 1893–1894 First Matabele War in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). During the Battle of the Shangani, 700 soldiers fought off 5,000 warriors with just five Maxim guns. It played an important role in the swift European colonization of Africa in the late 19th century. The extreme lethality was employed to devastating effect against obsolete charging tactics, when native opponents could be lured into pitched battles in open terrain. As it was put by Hilaire Belloc, in the words of the figure ""Blood"" in his poem ""The Modern Traveller"":
    &gt;
    &gt;&gt;Whatever happens, we have got
    &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;The Maxim gun, and they have not.[11]

* The monopoly on manufacturing was becoming impractical as manufacturing technology spread around the world, so there was less profit to be had.  I had a quote from a bit back in my old comments about why India's value to the British Empire was falling off pre-World-War-II -- because while the UK could still force India to have tariffs blocking import of manufactured goods from countries other than the UK, a domestic Indian manufacturing industry was growing and competing with exports of British manufactured goods.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hltqp2/europe_must_take_on_its_own_defense/fx2fnk3/,duisThias,1594008414

490,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Illusion

&gt;*The Great Illusion* is a book by Norman Angell, first published in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the title *Europe's Optical Illusion*[1] and republished in 1910 and subsequently in various enlarged and revised editions under the title *The Great Illusion*.[2] 

-

&gt; In *The Great Illusion*, Angell's primary thesis was, in the words of historian James Joll, that ""the economic cost of war was so great that no one could possibly hope to gain by starting a war the consequences of which would be so disastrous.""[3] For that reason, a general European war was very unlikely to start, and if it did, it would not last long.[4] He argued that war was economically and socially irrational[5] and that war between industrial countries was futile because conquest did not pay. J. D. B. Miller writes: ""The 'Great Illusion' was that nations gained by armed confrontation, militarism, war, or conquest.""[6]
&gt;
&gt; According to Angell, the economic interdependence between industrial countries would be ""the real guarantor of the good behavior of one state to another"",[5] as it meant that war would be economically harmful to all the countries involved. Moreover, if a conquering power confiscated property in the territory it seized, ""the incentive [of the local population] to produce would be sapped and the conquered area be rendered worthless. Thus, the conquering power had to leave property in the hands of the local population while incurring the costs of conquest and occupation.""[6]
&gt;
&gt;Further, the nature of modern capitalism was such that nationalist sentiment did not motivate capitalists, because ""the capitalist has no country, and he knows, if he be of the modern type, that arms and conquests and jugglery with frontiers serve no ends of his, and may very well defeat them.""[7]

621,"Erdogan didn't order another round of voting, his party basically complained to court about some minor violations and asked for a second election, the reason they did that wasn't that they actually expected to win the second time, but because Imamoglu, the new opposition mayor of Istanbul, promised to expose and publish all records and data on AKP's corruption and theft once he takes office, and by pushing for a second election AKP managed to push back for another couple of months before Imamoglu took office and destroyed as much evidence as they could during that time.

Obviously that's screwed up and the reasons they filed the complaints for were the most minor ones they could find just to pressure the court to order a re-election, which is why I called Turkey a *flawed* democracy, but the fact that this is what Erdogan has to do to hide his corruption, the fact that he was afraid of this stuff being exposed, that there is a strong opposition that is able to do this that AKP lost to in all major cities and twice in a row in the largest one, that Erdogan can't just make up election results like Putin, for example, does and has to accept them indicated that Turkey, despite all of her flaws, is still a democratic country.

You're correct about Erdogan's Islamic agenda, but than's not what we're arguing here about. OP said that ""UAE is one of the most progressive forces in the region, much more so than Turkey"" and you said that ""UAE enforces Sharia about as much as Turkey does"" and ""Turkey is as democratic as UAE is"", which were all ridiculous statements - Turkey, with actual elections, strong opposition, separation of church and state and no religious laws or punishments is infinitely more democratic and secular than theocratic monarchy of UAE with it's Sharia law, lack of democratic elections, capital punishment and barbaric medieval punishments such as amputation, lashing and stoning for the most ridiculous things like being gay, leaving religion, drinking alcohol, having premarital sex or kissing in public.

Mozemo is big suprise, they won 7 seats and they did that with very little funding - their ads had no air time on tv at all, internet and terrain work was most of their campaign.  SDP suffered big loss, in some of the key places like Zagreb where historically they never lost majority voted in favour of HDZ. 

Voter turn out was very low 46 %, and it seems its worse every year. I would say that mozemo attracted young voters and there was great enthusiasm over them, so turnout might have looked even worse. Corona also might have played a role here, how much is difficult to tell.

For someone on left, this might look bad. But HDZ at least defeated the extreme right and won the battle with all radical elements that revolted against their turn to centre. And there's also new left-green coalition that made exceptional progress and result, some political commentators gave them 3 seats at most and they won 7.

I am happy with result, HDZ will have a very difficult time this 4 years with corona shock on economy, they will have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions.

680,"&gt;	You are really something. First of all, saying that the ottomans were slave traders makes no sense because it is a retrospective interpretation. Meaning, you look at things in today’s understanding and todays virtues.

Ah I love this argument. It was different times when Ottomans were doing so no need to shit on them but let’s shit on west! Classic Turkish mentality tbh. 

&gt;	And second, turkish deep state was something that turkish public strongly wanted to enlightened. The state itself actively fought against it. Former prime minister Bülent Ecevit declared it’s existance to public As you already know, Gladio was a secret NATO organisation which funded and lead by CIA. 

I can make excuses for PKK as well but that won’t change the fact that they trade in drugs. Same applies to Turkey. Also check out alleged Turkish-ISIS trade which is far worse. Or check out how Turkey looted Syrian factories. You guys are definitly not innocent. 


Moreover, Grey Wolves, an horrible Turkish ultranationalist terror group themselves also very involved in drug trafficking who are protected by Turkish government.

&gt;	Just like PKK. 

PKK was born in Bekaa Valley, same place Deniz Gezmis got educated afaik. Its not cia but KGB probably but those are conspiracy theories.

&gt;	And also you already admit that PKK is dealing drugs and also deep turkish state in 90’s. How do you justify PKK in this?

How do you think PKK was allowed to traffic those drugs? But we get into conspiracy theories here. I personally don’t condone Turkish or Kurdish drug trafficking. But I find it incredible hypocritical when Turks act like PKK is the only one to blame. Turkish state itself is as bad as a mafia state or terrorist organisation. 

&gt;	that turkish state itself actively fought against the deep turkish state is actually justifies the turkish state.

693,"Prime minister says his country has ‘matured a lot’ since debt crisis and will set its own agenda

Greece’s prime minister has said he will not accept strict EU conditions on the use of coronavirus emergency aid, in a sign of the difficult negotiations ahead for the bloc’s leaders on its proposed €750bn recovery fund. Kyriakos Mitsotakis told the Financial Times in an interview that he would not countenance a return of the strict and unpopular oversight imposed on his country by the “troika” of EU, European Central Bank and IMF officials during the Greek debt crisis, “forcing us to do reforms” even though “there was never really any domestic buy-in”. “Greeks have matured a lot,” he said. “And we want to do our own reforms.” Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands are opposed to the European Commission’s plans for the recovery fund and are pushing for so-called “conditionality” to be applied to EU money to ensure it is spent to improve competitiveness. German chancellor Angela Merkel who supports the recovery fund has said the money must be used to “future proof” each economy. Mr Mitsotakis said a six-monthly review of economic performance carried out by the European Commission was sufficient. “I don’t think any additional strict conditionality is necessary,” he said, adding that every southern EU member state regarded it as “politically unacceptable”.

Given its near-economic collapse five years ago and deep cuts to public services under successive austerity programmes, Greece surprised many with its effective handling of coronavirus. As of the beginning of July it had recorded 192 deaths from Covid-19 and 3,432 confirmed cases. “It was very obvious to me that at some point we needed to go into full lockdown mode. And my political decision was to do it sooner rather than later,” said Mr Mitsotakis. After a decade of austerity, he could not allow a debilitated health system to be overrun, he said, but was “pleasantly surprised” by a service his centre-right New Democracy party had long wanted to restructure. It is approaching a year since Mr Mitsotakis won power from the far-left, promising a return to business-friendly reforms to entrench Greece’s recovery from the debt crisis. Since then, the pandemic has hammered its economy and sharply increased its mountainous debt burden. At the same time Mr Mitsotakis has had to contend with the “aggressive behaviour” of Turkey, which enraged Athens with its assertion of sovereignty over swaths of the eastern Mediterranean and by unleashing another migrant wave into Greece earlier this year. Mr Mitsotakis conceded it was fortunate the virus erupted during the winter when Greece receives few international visitors, but said he would have put his country into the same lockdown had the pandemic hit at the height of the summer season. Despite its luck, Greece’s economy could shrink by 10 per cent this year, the biggest contraction anywhere in the EU, according to the European Commission, because of its dependence on tourism.

Greece would only see a “fraction” of the 33m visitors it received last year, Mr Mitsotakis said. But people would make Greece their “top choice” once they understood the preparations the government had made, he said, including randomised testing, diagnostic capacity on even the smaller islands and a doubling of intensive care beds. Greece’s recovery from the debt crisis was propelled by a surge in tourist numbers and investment in high-end hotels and resorts. A once-booming sector, which accounts for about 20 per cent of gross domestic product, now looks like a liability. Does Mr Mitsotakis have a plan to diversify the economy? “We have a very, very aggressive reform agenda,” the prime minister said. It would focus on “the green transition, on the digital transition” and encouraging investment partly through a privatisation programme. The economy’s revival will also depend on improving the business climate, cutting bureaucracy, strengthening the rule of law and challenging the rent-seeking behaviour of Greece’s business oligarchs, say analysts. Mr Mitsotakis, a Harvard-educated former McKinsey consultant, is happy to describe himself as a pro-business “technocrat” in contrast with his firebrand anti-capitalist predecessor Alexis Tsipras, who took Greece to the brink of a euro exit in 2016.

But despite the modernising pitch, Mr Mitsotakis’s opponents detect signs of the Greek right’s traditional cosiness with big business interests that tarnished its image for decades. Recent changes to the criminal code set tight time limits for prosecutors investigating financial crimes committed during the debt crisis or freezing the assets of suspects. Mr Mitsotakis dismissed the criticism, saying there was ample time to investigate crimes. “We have been the champions of making sure the rule of law is upheld in Greece,” he said, blaming Mr Tsipras’s administration for interfering in the judicial system. The coronavirus crisis may have set back Mr Mitsotakis’s ambitions to revive Greece’s economy, but it has helped him turn the page on populism, of which his country was the first victim with Mr Tspiras’s rise to power in 2015, he said. Out of the crisis has emerged a “renewed sense of trust in politics and institutions and technocrats” that would give his government the legitimacy to pursue its reform agenda. “Covid did a lot to discredit those who believe that there are easy and simplified solutions to complicated problems, and those who always want to hold somebody else accountable for their own shortcomings,” he said. “This doesn’t work when you have to save lives on a daily basis and I think people realise that, not just in Greece but also at the global level.”",Greece,/r/europe/comments/hlwltu/mitsotakis_vows_greece_will_not_bow_to_eu/fx1pbh8/,XxXMorsXxX,1593991960

The second major political party CHP's leader is kurdish. And they have won Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir ( the biggest three cities of Turkey) with kurdish voters help.I am not going to say anything more than that on your comment about opposition in Turkey. 

In your last comment you are saying from European perspective it is still a threat. Well, from Turkey's perspective having a major power other than itself in the Eastern Mediterranean is a threat. As a country which has the longest coastline (1577km) to East Mediterranean Sea, why would Turkey let France, a country who doesn't share any coasline to the area, to interviene the East Mediterranean issue? If we are going to legitimize the actions of the countries we support on this issue, i think this sole reason is enough to make Turkey's claim more legitimate. It was easy to take adventage of less developed countries for centuries, get rich and brag about how developed your country is for France but now it's over.

That's actually wrong. Erdogan offered condolences for the deaths. That's not the same as an apology. He is very eager in denying any crime commited by the Turkish/Ottoman state.

937,"I've been back a few times to Tirana and Durrës. My whole family really loves visiting and spending time there.

On that first trip - we drove down and we I didn't want to do the whole thing in a single day. We spent the night in Tetovo and then the next day we were driving to Tirana to meed with friends before we headed south. I had an old GPS that wasn't the best. We went by lake Ohrid and so I figured we were on the right track but as we kept going I had a stronger and stronger feeling that we were not going the way we wanted to go.

I called a friend in Tirana and told him where we were and he said, ""That doesn't sound right, let me check and I'll call you back."" In the mean time we go to the border leaving Macedonia. I give the border guard all our documents and he starts asking me about the paper for my auto insurance that shows the countries where I am covered. Well at that time I was pretty new to Europe and had no idea what it was. He was getting pretty angry. He said, ""How did you get into the country?"" I told him, ""I gave them the papers I've just given you and no one said a thing they just let us in.""

He was mad, yelling and my kids were kind of freaked out. But finally he says, ""Well nothing happened so I guess it doesn't matter but you should never had been let in like this. You can never do this again and when you get to the Albanian side they will give you a lot of trouble over this.""

I got in the car, drove through the Albanian part and they didn't say anything about the insurance paper. What they did say was, ""Where are you going?"" I said, ""Tirana"" and they said, ""Then why are you here?"" But we went through.

Then my friend called me back and said, ""You messed up, you need to turn around and go back."" I said, ""We can't. The guy at the Macedonian border made that pretty clear."" So we got an unintentional driving tour of northern Albania.

The issue was the GPS thought we could just drive right through these mountains on roads/trails that my car could never navigate. That also meant it kept trying to take us off the road we did need to be on. So we had to stop often and ask people to be sure we were going the right way.

That was difficult because everyone was so friendly they kept asking us to stop, have drinks with them, etc. but we needed to keep going because this added quite a few hours to our day of driving.

I'm an Atheist, according to Islam I should be executed for leaving the faith, I'm by no means a supporters ""agressive Islamist agenda"". You literally can't stop hating on me and accusing me of something because I'm a Turk.

UAE is basically a diet Saudi Arabia, they're Islamists through. Ahval's editor-in-chief is a member of Gülen movement. Gülen helped Erdogan get elected, his media outlets, including the one this guy used to work for, couldn't stop singing praise for Erdogan, they helped him purge secularists out and install Islamists in every government institution in Turkey, they're literally only now became enemies with him over a power struggle. It's not ""brave critics of Turkish regime vs Islamist Erdogan"", it ""Islamists who'd like to run Turkey vs an Islamist that currently runs Turkey"". It's Islamists vs Islamists, not good guys vs bad guys.

Speaking of UAE's opposition to Muslim Brotherhood: that's actually the main reason for their backing of Ahval and the reason why there was a falling out between Turkey/Qatar and UAE/Saudi Arabia. Muslim Brotherhood and the Monarchy system in Saudi Arabia and UAE are incompatible, and Saudis and Emiratis therefore perceive it as a threat to the rule of their dynasties, they're Islamists essentially afraid of the other, rival Islamist movement. Which brings us full circe to my view on these things, it's not good guys vs bad guys, it bad vs bad.

Taliban in Afghanistan are fighting ISIS. It doesn't mean that Taliban are the good guys all of a sudden, it means that sometimes bad guys fight bad guys. Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are dangerous, theocratic, misogynistic countries that opress women, exploit slave labour and execute gay people, still use medieval punishment methods like flogging and stoning. Muslim Brotherhood are Islamists that hate progress and secularization. Erdogan and Qatar, the backers of Muslim Brotherhood, are Islamists. Gülen is an Islamist, and so are his followers including Ahval's editor-in-chief.

Great, that's a nice power plant right there, but the graph is clearly not comparing nuclear power plants to coal power plants.

Maybe you missed my point and the point of the graph? 

First, the graph doesn't provide any reasonable point of comparison, it just states that coal plants produce CO2, it doesn't even give the reader a comparison because that is not what it wants you to focus on. 

Second, it is titled ""Shipping giant climbs to 7th in EU top 10 polluters"" but doesn't state that this is second largest shipping company in the world with 471 container ships. So like my argument about Ryanair, if we would use this kind of misleading information to pinpoint a problem, maybe the shipping company should just split in two.

&gt; at this moment we don't have a viable air travel that isn't based on fossil fuels

Wait until you read about diesel engines they use on container ships and how there is no viable alternative there.

The issue with pollution cannot just be focused on one sector like this. The construction sector is a huge problem, car manufacturing is a huge problem, beef and dairy... it all needs to change.

1215,"Where is empirical evidence that children growing up with same sex parents suffer any longterm effects than children who have a traditional familiy?

My point is, i really couldnt care less if the parents are straight or gay - the most important aspect is, that the child is loved and cared for. 

So the notion that a child needs a mother and a father, who also need to be marries is extremely outdated; again, theres no evidence that suggests that this catholic influenced worldview is actually better than same sex couples raising a kid. 

At the end, to me, this sounds more like the same old ""fear of the unknown"" - they, lgbtq people, are different, therefore them raising a kid must be to the kids detriment. 

In conclusion, as i said in my op, i just cant understand why for so many people the sexuality of other people (and the consequences arising from it) still seems to be such a big concern. 

You know what is actually detrimental to kids who are raised by same sex couples? The whole stigmatisation of their parents.

&gt;In a recent biography, Frederiksen stated: 'For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Social Democrats voted for a law banning wearing of burqas and niqabs while abstaining during a vote on a law on mandatory handshakes irrespective of religious sentiment at citizenship ceremonies and on a plan to house criminal asylum seekers on a bridgeless island on which they would have to stay at night. Frederiksen also backed the right-wing populist Danish People's Party in their paradigm shift push to make repatriation rather than integration the goal of asylum policy.   
&gt;  
&gt;Labeling economic foreign policies of Europe as too liberal, Frederiksen has criticised other social democratic parties for losing their voters' trust by failing to prevent globalisation chipping away at labour rights, increasing inequality and exposing them to uncontrolled immigration.  
&gt;  
&gt;Frederiksen has referred to Islam as a barrier to integration, arguing that some Muslims ""do not respect the Danish judicial system"", that some Muslim women refuse to work for religious reasons and that Muslim girls are subject to ""massive social control"" and has called for Muslim schools to be closed.

In comparison to the Barcelona study the results seem to hold up better, but then again the Brazil study doesn't claim the virus was there over a year ago.

Unfortunately in contrast to the Barcelona study they don't show raw data, but at least they mention their criteria for positive samples and that seems OK too. Still not knowing how the raw data looks is a bit unsatisfactory.

So what does it say if its true? They found virus traces end of November, first reported cases in Wuhan though only in December. I guess that is the point you were making? Well the first reported cases in Brazil occurred much later than in China. Has there been any analysis of Wuhan waste water prior to the emergence of the virus? My point is we do not have the waste water data from any place in China, they've been doing these studies only in other countries (coincidence? I leave that to others).

So from those we know that waste water detection predates emergence of virus quite well and also quite far ahead sometimes. Waste water data from Wuhan might show traces of virus half a year before emergence as well. Until results like that from Wuhan are released (if ever and if so then please with full raw data and protocols), there is no grounds to say the virus had been somewhere else before Wuhan.

In July 2019, after a group of mostly European countries—and no Muslim-majority countries—signed a letter to the UN human rights chief condemning China’s actions in Xinjiang, more than three dozen states, including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, signed their own letter praising China’s “remarkable achievements” in human rights and its “counterterrorism” efforts in Xinjiang.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare

&gt; In Nazi Germany, much research went into developing new chemical weapons, such as potent nerve agents.[9] However, chemical weapons saw little battlefield use in World War II. Both sides were prepared to use such weapons, but the Allied powers never did, and the Axis used them only very sparingly. The reason for the lack of use by the Nazis, despite the considerable efforts that had gone into developing new varieties, might have been a lack of technical ability or fears that the Allies would retaliate with their own chemical weapons. Those fears were not unfounded: the Allies made comprehensive plans for defensive and retaliatory use of chemical weapons, and stockpiled large quantities.[10][11] Japanese forces used them more widely, though only against their Asian enemies, as they also feared that using it on Western powers would result in retaliation. Chemical weapons were frequently used against Kuomintang and Chinese communist troops.[12] However, the Nazis did extensively use poison gas against civilians in The Holocaust. Vast quantities of Zyklon B gas and carbon monoxide were used in the gas chambers of Nazi extermination camps, resulting in the overwhelming majority of some three million deaths. This remains the deadliest use of poison gas in history.[13][14][15][16]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hl0nkp/equipment_of_a_private_of_polish_army_and_a/fwz8nvd/,duisThias,1593933323

1481,"I am not saying it was lalaland, and I am replying to your claims which are too large extent ridiculous. Eastern Christianity wasn't losing anything by the Union, the only difference was that they accepted the Pope instead of the Patriarch as their head (no wonder Patriarch was protesting). The clash was between them, uniate and non-uniate believers, they were fighting over churches and offices, not Roman Catholics with Orthodox believers.

Getting access to Senat was one of the reasons Orthodox bishops wanted union with Holy See, the other reason was that Orthodox church was in dire situation, it needed reform, also it was a way to separate itself from Moscow, which was claiming suzerainty over Orthodoxy in PLC.

Union was made in 1596. Two years later during Sejm truce between both parts was concluded on king's request. In 1603 Kiev Pechersk Lavra was handed over to Orthodox clergy. In 1607-1609 freedom of worship for Orthodoxy was enacted, also they it was prohibited to take away their goods or lands. In 1632 both Churches were equaled in rights, and Orthodoxy was completely ""legalised"" in all terms.

Sigismund didn't ban any schools, that's bullshit. Moreover more Orthodox schools and brotherhoods was built during his reign than ever before. Also ban on building non-catholic churches is bullshit, certainly not in 1632 (when Orthodoxy regained all its rights).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/hl5ucd/on_this_day_451_years_ago_the_polishlithuanian/fwz9c5k/,iwanttosaysmth,1593933993

1497,"Czechoslovakia was one of the richest countries on earth before the communist fiasco. We had better gdp per capita than Austria, Finland, Italy. But it was not the same thing after the glorious era. If course we are behind, if we are 40 years behind. After the fall of iron curtain, we may be the richest country in eastern block, but it's like being the least blind football player.

After the split, czech republic had twice as good economy and also infrastructure (that was one of the reasons in tension between slovaks and czechs, because most of the infrastructure was being built in czechia during the era and we were behind), also they took our gold reserves.

Now they are still doing better but the difference is way smaller. The country which does the best job from all the east block nonsense is Estonia. And look at their corruption levels and compare them with rest of the eastern block. Also they have made a clear line after this misfortune past and they are moving forward, on the other side of the spectrum when speaking of dealing with past is Belarus and Serbia and look at their problems. It's quite clear to me what has to be done. Could Slovakia be doing better job? Jesus Christ of course!! The biggest problems to me are the formal education and corruption. (You have to understand that Slovakia was ranked second most corrupted country in OECD after Mexico, and if know anything about corruption in Mexico, that is hard to beat).

East and west German are the same people? Say this to someone in Munchen or Frankfurt. You can literally see the difference between east and west from space, because the lamps they used. Also what Berlin looks like or Dresden and their ""nationalistic"" scene etc... Do you think it is a coincidence that rent in Munchen is four times higher than in Leipzig? And unlike Slovakia, west German takes a lot of effort with supporting east. It's not like Austria is trying to rebuild Slovakia, unlike in Germany. Yes eastern Germany was the better one from communist countries, but far from their western siblings, and still is to this day, and there has been done a lot and I mean a lot of improvements.

Culture wise, it's changing all over the country but yes, that's a very unfortunate result of previous ""system"" again. All post soviet countries have this problem, because the lack of infrastructure. But the working culture is different in most of the cities (even when the economy is not on pair), even in Ukraine from Portugal. And I don't mean that as a bad thing necessarily, but it is the fact at least in my experience. It's like the South Korea thing when people work harder, that's how they built the country. Now Slovakia is far from South Korea in this regard haha, but Portugal is further. I was studying at faculdade de Ciências, and I was surprised how very few people actually study some science there, there were a lot of those ecology studies etc...

China is no longer the place of ""cheap labor"".  While they might be less expensive than many in the West, they are hella more expensive than many others.

The correct answer to ""Why's that"" is: inertia.

Companies have investments and supply chains.  They don't want to just write that all off.  If the pandemic has shown us anything, though, those investments and supply chains are already at risk of China doing stuff on a whim.  This is even without considering that China is willing and able to steal every bit of IP you own.

The endgame here is that companies are waking up to these unfortunate facts.  The smarter ones are already moving as much of their supply chain out of China as they can.  

Once enough companies have reduced their exposure so that China is not needed, then the hard politics will follow.

1588,"&gt;Sure, but for some reason Orthodox nobles were still appointed on offices, new churches were built, Orthodox brotherhoods were established from Lviv to Kyiv...

&gt;And so in 1596, a church agreement was entered between the orthodox Church in the Republic and the catholic Church. The Union, though, was cinducted by only some orthodox bishops and not by the lower clergy and the faithful. The orthodox bishops who accepted the suppremacy of Rome were promised a place in the Senate. As well as lands and political status equal to that of catholic bishops. The new denomination was to keep its rituals and lithurgy. Under the Union of Brest, King Sigismund III Vasa delegalised the Orthodox Church. Orthodox clergy were prohibited from conducting church or using church and cementories. The orthodox Church went underground.

Yes the Church was persecuted to the point that even the Patriarch of Constantinople complained. If POC was the tolerant religious lalaland you were talking about : 

1/ Orthodox priest wouldn't feel forced to convert to catholicism in order to gain lands and equal rights to that of the catholics

2/ Ruthenians would have never rebelled against what was perserved as an attack against their faith and identity. 

 Sigismund III not only banned the Orthodox Church and its schools. When his son was elected Czar his number uno goal was to convert the whole population instead of being pragmatical.",,/r/europe/comments/hl5ucd/on_this_day_451_years_ago_the_polishlithuanian/fwz3i2k/,XX_bot77,1593928513

support for registred partnership is above 50%

adopting kids is a bit complicated, some people arent against it because they think gay couple cant rise them properly but because of state of current state of society, they fear such children will experiance bullying in school because of that which I sadly expect could happen.
Another people probably saw too much of some crazy LGBT people on the internet(I am not saying LGBT people are crazy but that there some crazy people among LGBT), like for example parent FORCING his son  to wear dress. And because of that fears it will happen to other children.
And probably yet another group probably heard in media few times about priests molesting younger boys and probably assumed that there is more pedophiles among gay people then straight people.

Every regime is eventually destined to ""fail"", in a way. The catch is, pretty much all long-standing regimes are/have been postponing their fate, through timely reforms to adapt and evolve with their time. 

I mean, the Roman republic eventually ""failed"", but the institutions of the late republic bore little resemblance with those of the early republic -- would it make sense, then, to claim that a republican Rome was ""*destined to fail*""? The same goes for the kingdom of France, which couldn't have survived for over a thousand of years without being massively and fundamentally altered over time.

My point being, the institutions of the Rzeczpospolita weren't necessarily inherently flawed (thus inherently ""destined to fail"" because of their peculiar nature), they probably just stagnated for way too long, and several windows of opportunity to reform them in time were missed.

1712,"There is a huge difference in lithology between bedrocks. Bedrock just means a consolidated rock as opposed to a loose material like soil or sand. It really doesn’t tell you anything about the properties of the rock.
Some rocks are more susceptible to weathering processes than others. And it is of course correct that consolidated rocks are in general more resistant to weathering than unconsolidated rocks,  but weathering of bedrocks can still be significant on a human timescale. Coastal erosion is a massive problem across most of the world.   
The rock in question here seems to be calcarenite - which is a type of limestone. And as you correctly state the caves at sea level is a clear indication of ongoing erosion. These caves are mainly developed by erosive and corrosive wave action on the cliffs. As the caves deepen, the risk of cave collapse increases. The erosion is therefore mainly an episodic and localized process associated with storm waves. 
According to a study conducted between 1997 and 2003, cliff retreat was in the range of 0.01 – 0.1 m/year along the Apulian coast.

1726,"Wow! 

Compared to BLM this crowd is very shocking. Then again I know my German friends are very good at whataboutism when it comes to the CCP comparing everything to the US including millions of Uighurs suddenly rounded up (a friend of mine, from Germany, intelligent but naive said that hundreds of thousands of African Americans are killed yearly by police in secret camps and prison locations while there is no proof a single Uighur has ever been mistreated in any fashion). 

Anyways, for the very few Germans that actually give a flying fuck about anything that happens to glorious misunderstood China... thank you. The world thanks you, people who want justice and freedom thank you. To the 99.999999% of the rest of Germany, perhaps look beyond what news and satire in Germany tells you to think. Even if you just read Swedish/British news now and again. I promise you, we arent all shills. 

Going back to the Germans I do know, the same goes with COVID. They have more hate toward the US than China. They are not sure if it even came from China as (to them) there is no proof! But who's to say it didn't originate from the US?? And how the US has treated the virus (granted we handled it worse than the Trump admin did in the US - for us locally, but we are getting much better). 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope Germany wakes up to the CCP before its too late. The problem with German society is they believe they have no propaganda, that what they hear and see is purity, especially if you go by online charts. That the media focusing heavily on certain issues in totally different countries while only briefly bringing up issues in another country isn't propaganda (in reality, its not. Fox News in America for example will totally ignore certain topics by design too, when they do that particular thing - not propaganda).

I know saying anything negative about the Glorious Germans here is like shooting yourself in the foot and thats fine if anyone reading this really thinks Germany is perfect, if that makes you sleep at night go for it buy while I live in this union - what Germany does directly can harm me and my every day life but also the ideals that most of us have that're becoming more and more distant from the average German.

1822,"Have you seen history map videos, did any research about history?

While in Europe, the middle east and east Asia kingdoms, city states, empires, innovation, thought, this and that happened people got better and better at stuff

The middle east (we all know it, lets be honest) Islam and mainly the east Turkic invasions and Mongol empire devastated the middle east, but honestly it was Islam which held innovation back

I mean I’m of Iranic origin, uptil our last great empire (Sasanian empire) we were literally the rivals of Rome, no other power in the vicinity could rival us, and after the Arabs muslim jihad and conquest we ended up like that

If the Sasanian empire never fell, it would have most definitely became Christian (Zoroastrianism was dying out honestly), most definitely Orthodox and maybe even formed a union with the Byzantine/east Roman empire and who knows how history would have turned our, but

Anyway I got sidetracked, don’t blame others for your weakness, Africa was literally underdeveloped and was colonized easily because it was tribal, was incredibly behind and the slave trade was literally africans selling africans, also arabs but Arabs also enslaved Europeans etc but anyway

I see this argument always coming up and people saying “your wealth was built up of looting Africa this that”

You should do some research about what they “looted” they took the raw resources, which in modern day didn’t contribute much at all iirc, there were no real cities in Africa either, no real big historical central cities to have been looted of lmao

It was the innovation, experience built up of the European people and more that got Europe to where its today, nothing else.

1991,"&gt; according to Douglas Arthur Howard's classic on Turkey more than 87% of Turks fled Bulgaria alive and well

&gt; this survival rate is not true for the persecution happend between 1850-1920. Up to 200k Pomaks were christianized

He actually writes about the 1870 period and the war between Russia and Turkey and how it affected the Balkans. And as far as christianization goes that was normal during population resettlement. Many people had lands and interests in their respective areas. Some to how many Greeks were Turkified and converted to Islam in order to avoid the population exchange between Greece and Turkey and hold on to their wealth and privilages. 

And of course I agree with you about the socialist regime's persecutions. These regimes had a vile agenda. Not only in the Balkans but in other areas too. No citizen was safe from their nature of politics. What happened in socialist Bulgaria pretty much resembled the horrors of Kemalist nationalism and the policies of Turkification but in a Bulgarian context. 

&gt; Just because their ancestors settled on these lands by Ottoman empire does not justify their deaths and forced deportation with bad logistics from the land they were born. It is still a purge even if it is not considered as a genocide.

Sure. But there is something to observe here. Greeks purged Turks. Bulgarians purged Turks. Serbians purged Turks. Montenegrins purged Turks. Arabs purged Turks. Albanians purged Turks. It wasn't just a faulty policy of a state. If *all of the subjects of Turkish imperialism* acted the same way that speaks volumes about the nature of the Turkish occupation. And for every actions there is a reaction. It is of course sad that many innocent people were caught up in this. And this is one more reason to highlight as a destructive consequence of imperialism. Especially settling. This is why the world was mad at Ecevit.

&gt; All these instances do is promote ethnic cleansing, oppose multiethnic developement and create tensions were there should be not. Equality of all regardless of background seems important to many.

Completely agree with you, therefore, as I said I dont support the Turkification actions of Kemalism and I am mainly supportive of other radical policies that contributed the progression Of Turkish Republic. But I am also supportive of how his actions resulted in Yoruk Turcomans being acknowledged and respected by the society. In Mango’s Book “ Ataturk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey”, it explains the Ataturks reform while not including the purges since Those purges were not the only thin Ataturk did.

2132,"&gt; Well have you read the diaries of Greek revolutionaries? Kolokotronis wanted to create a ""half-Christian, half-Turkish state"". Although to be fair he was probably refering to muslim Albanians as Turks but nonetheless according to his own testimony he was inspired by the liberalism of the French Revolution and Napoleon himself (who himself liked Islam). 

It is extremely unlikely that Kolokotronis had any strong convictions against the slaughter his men carried out. If he held any disapproval of such behavior, then said beliefs certainly lacked any real conviction. If Kolokotronis wished, he could have at least done what Ypsilantis did and criticize it. If he truly despised what his men were doing, he’d have done something, anything.

When massacres happened, Ypsilantis went out and criticized the brutal behavior, something that helped cost him all his influence. When he was present, he tried to stop it, and nobody listened. Kolokotronis is recorded as having done neither- the closest to these he has done are private, barely-committal lamentations in his own writings, words that would and did affect nothing. Despite the patchwork nature of the Revolution’s fighters, Kolokotronis still had more influence over his men than Ypsilantis ever did, yet he is barely recorded to try and stop the charnel houses men under his own command made out of the Acrocorinth or Tripolitsa. Indeed, he was entirely willing to step over the corpses littering the streets of Tripolitsa to pick out his share of the loot: so much loot that a convoy of more than fifty horses was needed to carry it.

&gt; The Turks of Greece left few traces. They disappeared suddenly and finally in the spring of 1821 unmourned and unnoticed by the rest of the world. Years later, when travellers asked about the heaps of stones, the old men would explain, ‘There stood the tower of Ali Aga, and there we slew him, his harem and his slaves’. It was hard to believe then that Greece had once contained a large population of Turkish descent, living in small communities all over the country, prosperous farmers, merchants and officials, whose families had known no other home for hundreds of years. As the Greeks said, the moon devoured them.

Upwards of twenty thousand Turkish men, women and children were murdered by their Greek neighbours in a few weeks of slaughter. They were killed deliberately, without qualm or scruple, and there were no regrets either then or later. That Greece Might Still be Free, by William St. Clair

Strawman fallacy. 


&gt;statues

The west doesn't have better figures to praise than slave owners, warlords, or conquerors? 

&gt;and half of our literature

Literature doesn't need to be removed lmao. Unless it contains blatant hatred and racism. At least it shouldn't be praised but still available. 


&gt; because we gotta judge the Romans and medieval Europeans by 2020 standards

We shouldn't bring those medieval values into 2020 either. 

&gt; Don't you see the damn extremism here?

Wait, how many statues or books were burned in Europe? Are you talking about Europe or Murica? 

&gt; When do we plan the book burning parties because various authors had racist views?

I'm a hatred reductionist. I would ban the quran, 4chan, the bible and torah aswell. Hatred shouldn't be tolerated. Put in there the communist manifesto if it preaches hatred aswell.


&gt;I don't really care. If I go to a country that celebrates someone who attacked my country

That's a nice strawman. We are talking about figures who would enslave or genocide your ethnicity or race being praised. Not just conquering.

I assume you are Christian. How would you feel if some Muslims erected a statue of ISIS leader Baghdad or some sultan responsible for mass rape and carnage? Wouldn't be nice eh?

Especially if you lived there and had to see that everyday. Telling you where your place is.


&gt;he problem is you significantly boost their numbers when you start EXAGERATING with uncontrolled immigration like Merkel did, and obsessive-PC nonsense.

Man, I wish immigration was as uncontrolled as you claim it is for Germany. I would have loved to be a German right now or get a citizenship or a work visa.

I wouldn't even be able to dream to be a German because how strict Germany immigration laws are.

As for PC nonsense. Well, what the AfD guys are saying is terrifying. Like there is no PC with those guys at all.

&gt;The bottom line is that you need to take a deep breath and see what increases far-right extremism

So we should listen to the far right to reduce the far right?

How come Poland or Russia keep electing far right parties and they remain far right?

You would expect a country with almost zero immigration would soften their tone towards minorities or Muslims. Doesn't seem to be the case. 


&gt;. Before the EU immigration debacle, they were just an insignificant minority of nutjobs. But by not addressing the concerns of the population, their numbers grew at an alarming level that will now influence our society.

The rise in far right parties is across the board, and has nothing got to do with immigration. Poland, Hungary, Spain and Portugal are all swinging to the far right but have zero Muslim immigration or very low numbers.

Do explain this. The balkans has been xenophobic and ultra nationalist while not a single Syrian immigrant or otherwise, wants to move here. Not even into Muslim countries like Bosnia, Albania or Kosovo.

2147,"&gt;Whataboutism. The US invaded mainly because of 9/11 which in itself was sufficient reason to invade. However, all other factors contribute to the moral case for war.

9/11 was done by a bunch of saudis, Bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan a U.S ally, Binladen is dead, why is America still in Afghanistan? 

&gt;Again, it contributes to the moral aspect of this war. Legally, the Security Council resolution sealed the deal.

  [The UN Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN_Charter) is a treaty ratified by the United States and thus part of US law. Under the charter, a country can use armed force against another country only in self-defense or when the Security Council approves. Neither of those conditions was met before the United States invaded Afghanistan. The Taliban did not attack us on 9/11. Nineteen men – 15 from [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia) – did, and there was no imminent threat that Afghanistan would attack the US or another UN member country. The council did not authorize the United States or any other country to use military force against Afghanistan. The US war in Afghanistan is illegal.

2611,"You need to realize why it's important that the Westerns in the 16th century created a new name for the empire, why Western officials calling the ERE back when it still existed the ""Greek Empire"" was basically an insult. You need to realize the difference between recognizing someone as emperor or as a king. These are crucial things to understanding everything we are discussing here and it can't be done without be willing to take a step back from the historical narrative Paparigopoulos created for the modern Greek nation. Well there were many scholars during the Greek enlightened that didn't want to associate Greece with the ""Byzantine Empire"", one of the most prominent ones I can think of is Adamantios Korais.

In order to realize why the ERE was the most hated empire in the West and why some Greek scholars hated it too you have to understand the relationship between the West and the East and how it developed over the centuries. Religion was most certainly not the driving factor behind the Greek revolution. The Greek revolution was the first modern national revolution in the Ottoman Empire. Calling it basically a religious revolution is simply inaccurate. Greek school history books are not enough to fully understand those subjects.

Perhaps you misunderstood what I wrote but I didn't say that Greece has no connection to the ERE.

Here's the thing, I have spent time talking to a real historian about those things. I actually never missed a single one of his classes. Even took some elective courses he taught because I find that stuff very interesting. For the sake of anonymity, I can't reveal the name, but that is his field of expertise.

2654,"Yes you can't be a nazi in 1918 because the nazi party was founded in 1920. The fact that both the nazis and a swedish future nazi used swastika, which was commonly used symbol at the time, is called a coincidence. Hitler didn't take inspiration from the Finnish Air Force when he came up with it, come on get real. This discussion is going nowhere.

Here you are rationalizing Stalin's paranoia, Leningrad had more people living in it than the entire country of Finland. The countries signed a non-aggression pact in 1932 (extended in 1934) in which they promised to respect each other's borders, stay neutral if either party got into a conflict with a third party and refrain from any activity that could be seen as directed against the other. The soviets violated the treaty by threatening war and ultimately shelled their own country to weasel out of it altogether. Finland wasn't looking for a fight with the superpower next door, they were afraid of it. The reason why the defenses were all on the eastern border was that relations with Sweden were good, Sweden had no territorial ambitions in Finland after the Åland crisis had been resolved. 

[Your maps are wrong](https://imgur.com/a/sptABPN), even the proposition in 23.10 cut into the Mannerheim line and would have left a 30 km undefended gap on the coast, which given the current climate in Europe would have been a huge threat, the Soviets had just invaded half of Poland and fortifying the sector would have taken some time.

On to the Finnish democracy. The parliament had been established in 1907 so there had already been free and fair elections for over a decade when the duchy became a state. The way it works is that you need more than 50% of the votes in parliament to get anything passed so if you lose your absolute majority in the elections (elections are not a trick, they are what makes a democracy) you have to create a coalition with other parties to get more than 50% of the parliament on your side. There is no law which states that the largest single party gets to rule if they don't have the majority. Once you have the votes, you get ignore the parties not in your coalition and they are called the opposition. So if the SDP had been given power, they would have ignored 55% of the population. Our current government is ignoring 41% of the population and that is fine. The ruling faction of the SDP didn't respect this system at the time so they launched an armed revolt against the democratically elected government. The ones that didn't take part in the rebellion or didn't flee to Russia worked within the democratic system to achieve their goals with the bourgeoisie parties, who showed themselves very willing to compromise and make life better for everyone. Hell, the tenant farmer system was voted to be abolished only two months after the end of the war, as there had been plans to do it even before it broke out.

I agree the civil war was not fought over freedom, but over class differences. Although the Reds, in their desperation late in the war, had promised to join the Soviet Union if they won, in exchange for aid.",,/r/europe/comments/hjgalq/finlands_air_force_quietly_drops_swastika_symbol/fwvt9bh/,xXAllWereTakenXx,1593846865

Vilnius region was not ethnically Polish since forever and we have vague data on when it became a thing.

2869,"Some thoughts...

1. Turkey's ""growth model"" is basically built on cheap credit binges. State banks are *encouraged* to massively boost cheap credit, which fuels private consumption. As such, Turkey imports a huge amount but doesn't export enough to cover that, leading to large trade imbalances. Combined with high inflation, this means that their currency loses value in order to stay competitive with other currencies on the world market.

2. Turkey's real prosperity is in fact even lower than that chart shows. This is because their average wages are very low (€450/month). Wages and nominal GDP per capita track each other very well, yet Turkey's nominal GDPpc is much higher than predicted by their low wages. How come? Because Turkstat [cooks the books](https://erikmeyersson.com/2017/01/22/is-new-turkeys-growth-model-from-outer-space/).

3. As Turkey's economy flounders, we're likely to see AKP increasingly shift to hypernationalism as a means of distraction, as well as foreign ""adventures"". This strategy has already begun and could well succeed.

2963,"Haha no sweat bud. You're the one speaking the foreign language, not me! Speaking of foreign languages, the one I chose to learn was actually German. If you're considering learning German, rest assured it is much easier than Russian. You'll find that your knowledge of English will pay off. Actually moving to their country is another beast entirely... it's quite a hard nut to crack as an immigrant. Not legally, but socially. Many of your countrymen have formed parallel societies there due to a myriad of reasons. But there's no questioning there's good work there and a decent amount of money to be made. Not as much as Canada, UK, Australia, or USA, but a lot. Whats funny is that knowledge of Russian in the USA is actually quite a desired skill when it comes to getting a job. The government always wants people who know Russian/Arabic/Dari/Pashto for intelligence work. Problem is that they have to be born here as they need a security clearance. 

On reddit we're all economists! I joke, but it really sucks to see the potential of a people be held back by governmental barriers such as high taxation and bureaucracy. Too often is the state used as a tool to bludgeon the progress and abilities of the people. I think Argentina is the most glaring example of such a country, but I guess you could lump Turkey in there if your statements are correct. The part about land/construction is very interesting. In my country it is kindof the opposite, farmers/food produces are held in extreme high regard (partly due to the electoral college, they get lots of benefits/tax breaks) and it is quite hard to build anything in most places. Maybe we could both learn from each other a little bit haha.

People using university to delay entering the ""real world"" is a universal thing I think. I'm 21 right now, soon I'll graduate college and have a job writing software if my internship gives me a job offer. Not a given, but I'm hopeful. Many of my fellow students are definitely going to drag school out though, considering the economy right now. It's hard for anybody that didn't chose to do an engineering degree right now.

Like straight up giving the Syrians passports? And they don't even speak Turkish right? Well... yeah I mean that's pretty crazy. I mean maybe if AKP is in danger of losing. It's funny how many of our countries are becoming these weird pseudo-democracies. My country, yours, Russia, Brazil. Obviously on very different levels, but it's still crazy. I'm trying to imagine if Trump just gave a bunch of refugees passports to vote for him, it'd be so ironic. And aren't a large amount of Syrians Christians too? I guess that would be counterproductive to making the country more Islam. We have a very large porous land border too. There's no real good answer to it... maybe build a wall and Assad will pay for it? lol

Ah that's a man right there! Over a decade in the league. Crazy how so many do it for so long. And don't worry, I'm sure you're uncle suffers due to how bad the Canadians are ;)

There's one Turkish export that's relatively popular in America. There's this company called ""Canik"" that makes a gun called the Canik-TP9. One of the various ""wonder 9's"" you can buy here. I've shot it before, it's a nice gun for how inexpensive it is. Around 300$, when a Glock can cost around 500$. So, if you want a cheap gun but don't want to buy something extremely low quality, people usually buy that gun. The Brazilians make a lot of the cheap guns these days too.

Maybe this is the eternal optimist in me, but if you keep working at it you'll be able to make it some day. I wouldn't let your education or qualifications necessarily limit you. Just because you got a degree in Russian doesn't mean you necessarily have to work exclusively with the Russian language (and those damn Black Sea tourists). Working with Russian exporters that do bushiness with Turkey and need language/cultural help for example. There's always a niche out there for everybody, and opportunities pop up if you work at them. So maybe instead of looking directly to Germany, look at Russia/Belarus/Ukraine first. Find something they need and then offer it. Then springboard from there. But of course, you know your situation better than I do. Finishing the degree is obviously first priority. And then hey, something will work out.",tar heel,/r/europe/comments/hkpfa3/turkey_getting_poorer_and_poorer_since_2013/fwv1np2/,mudcrabulous,1593825954

To balance that either requires a fiscal transfer or a free-floating currency (which can devalue) - that Greece didn't have either is why its deficit eventually resulted in a fiscal crisis (and why the EU wants a unified fiscal policy).

Prevent something, future tense. How does Scotland become, future tense.

Meaning Scotland hasn't become independent, instead the UK government are preventing ""it"" by doing such and such.

What's ""it""? They obviously can't *prevent* independence by making Scotland independent, so what is the ""it"" in question?

3296,"&gt;Finnish civil war wasn't ""communists vs nationalists"" 

Who argues that? 

Still his present was made to kill communists, regardless of whom exactly Von Rosen considered as such - social-democrats, bolsheviks, social-revolutineers...

&gt; democratically elected government 

Who/when/where democratically elected them? 

White Guards were democratically elected? 

Finland didn't even have consitution, what legalty are you talking about? 

It was a messy fight for power, between sides with different interests.

&gt; who for obvious reasons weren't too keen on the redistributing thing 

By what right some own land and others have to work for them? No control over rent, no control over stability. 

Remind me, where did it started? Lokka? When swedish baron (who didn't even speak finnish) left 150 families in forest?

Wow, what a great people these Whites are. /s

&gt; Second of all. It's a fact that the swastika became a symbol of fascism because of the nazis. 

I don't think finnish Whites, who were focused on nationalism, and later joined nazis are different in mindset. 

So a) roots for both were in NatSoc movements, b) behaviour and views of people who used this symbol were approximately the same.

&gt; It's purely a coincidence that a future nazi used it as his emblem in 1918. 

So many coincidences - Von Rosen - fascist, Goring relative. Finland - Whites (Jagers) served with german in WW1, continued (with nazis) as brothers in arms in WW2. Symbol raise in Finland \~1918, for Nazis early 1920s. 

All coincidences, right? :)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Or do you think Hitler got it from him? 

No, I think that views of Von Rosen and Hitler were similar.

&gt; to clarify, I don't mind them changing the emblem, it's probably for the better in this day and age

Should I read this as ""I prefer not to, but it attracts too much attention to what's going on with finnish nationalistic (and military) education""?

&gt;I just don't agree with your take on the Finnish civil war

I don't agree with Finnish White Guards killing russians all around Finland for their ethnicity.

I don't agree with Vyborg Massacre.

I don't agree with whitewashing White Guards in Civil War. Civil war which with help of German Army they transformed into bloodbath of white terror, killing thousands people.

There is a definition to this behavior - White Terror and repressions (shot and killed in camps with hunger) after war - it's called politicide. 

And later that resulted in Winter War (refusal to consider soviet interests about safety of territory) and WW2 pariticpation on nazi side.

So, whoever tries to justify this chain of events (1st finnish republic, right?) - for me is either fooled or vile-intented.

&gt; this has been some kind of an evil racist symbol in the context of its history

Why don't you tell that to Leningrade starvated citizens? To victims of ethnocide in Karelia? To soldiers who died defending their homeland (far from 1938 borders)?

3379,"Hong Kong's 'one country, two systems' status is gravely under threat. 

Local dissatisfaction is so great that even last October, a survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that 40pc of the city’s 7.5 million residents were interested in emigrating. 

Now, the question mark over the future of the city’s democratic freedom is so ominous that the British Government has said it will offer visas to the nearly 3 million people in Hong Kong who either hold or are eligible to apply for a British National Overseas passport. 
But one maverick Hong Kong property developer is taking the vision of mass migration of Hong Kongers much further. There are now bold, experimental plans to create a new Hong Kong elsewhere in the world – and it could be built in Britain.

The utopian promise of charter cities

Ivan Ko, a real estate tycoon, wants to build a new version of Hong Kong somewhere else, complete with its own regulations and entrepreneurial spirit. He plans to do this in the form of an international charter city – or possibly three of them.

A charter city is a metropolitan area that has a special jurisdiction and can determine its own system of municipal governance over the general law of the country it sits in. 

Effectively, a charter city has its own constitution, independent of the country that it exists in.
Versions of the concept are common enough – there are more than 120 in California, including San Francisco and Los Angeles.

But an international charter city would be different. Ko, who is chairman of developer RECAS, has no template to work on because the idea is entirely radical; this would be a brand new city, built from the ground up.
  
The idea is that it would be integrated within the laws and democracy of its host country, but its founders would essentially have an opportunity to build a new socio-economic and political system. It could act as a more refined special economic zone, with different tax systems and commercial policies to stimulate wealth creation.
 
Building an international charter city designed for mass migration from one country to another would also turn real estate development to almost a business of nation-making.

It has never been done before. The idea for international charter cities began more than a decade ago with the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer, who tried to set up charter cities in Madagascar and Honduras. But these attempts failed.

Now, it is a concept that is gaining new momentum. Paypal founder Peter Thiel is among the investors who last year put $9million into Pronomos, a venture capital fund for building a charter city. Former Uber executive Ryan Rzepecki, who sold his bike company Jump to the ride hailing app for $200million, is also considering funding a new city.

Still, few have considered building one in a developed country – it is hard to see how the promise of economic stimulus could outweigh the costs and risks.

Building a brand new city

To build a new charter city, you need land near a water source measuring 25,000 acres or more – an area a little bit smaller than Newcastle and a bit bigger than the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. 

Ko has founded Victoria Harbour Group, which is currently scouting the world for locations, looking for land in developed, common law countries. He aims to source a location this year and to begin planning and building the project’s infrastructure in 2021.

The company is in discussions with four governments in the West, says Ko. Ireland is top of the list and Victoria Harbour Group was due to meet with the government in February, although travel restrictions have postponed the trip. 

It is “reasonably realistic” that Britain could become a host country, particularly considering the offer of BNO visas, says Dr Mark Lutter, who runs the Charter Cities Institute, a non-profit that advises on building charter cities in emerging markets, and who has been working with Victoria Harbour Group.

With Brexit, there is also the chance to do something bold and experimental. While the idea of free ports has been mooted, this would be a more extreme next step.
“If countries desire to generate economic activity, having a bunch of very smart people who can bring investment and jobs will generate a better future not just for them but for the host country,” adds Dr Lutter.

But in reality, how many nations will be open to building a new city when they are grappling with a global pandemic? In Britain, public debt has now exceeded the entirety of our GDP for the first time since 1963. And this project would be an undertaking that would make HS2 comparable to a toy train track.

Where would the money come from?

The aim is for the city to be populated half by Hong Kong emigrants and half by locals from the host country, says Dr Lutter. He thinks that around 25 to 33pc of the people who want to move will look to move to the new city, while most will want to move to already established places. Ko puts that number at about 2 million.

Victoria Harbour Group is currently trying to raise money from investors both in Hong Kong and Silicon Valley. Once planning is underway, they hope there will be several more rounds.

Rather than purchasing land, Ko hopes to enter into a public-private joint venture with a government. “In that case, our investment in land would be minimal and the government would have a stake in us, so we would be sure that the government would help us to make the city successful,” says Ko. Investors would get returns from rents.

But he also has an even more radical plan. After 10 or 12 years, he plans to float Victoria Harbour Group. Essentially, there would be an IPO for a city.

A new democracy, created by a company
Victoria Harbour Group will be 50pc owned by a non-profit foundation, says Ko. It would use dividends to fund public spending, support job training and education and to sponsor migration. 

It plans to make this new city into more than just a place for the higher income Hong Kongers who could afford to emigrate anyway. “I believe the value of people comes in their network. If we’re able to partially transplant that network, then a lot of people’s relationships can be preserved,” says Dr Lutter.

The conditions of self governance will be dependent on the host country, says Ko. The plan is to have a city manager, the first of whom would be initially appointed by the company, but would then become accountable to a council of local residents.

Is there a diplomatic risk for the host country?

Building a new rival to Hong Kong would surely be a red flag to China, which is busy taking control of the government there.

But the team is quick to dismiss this idea that it would antagonise the Chinese government. “It’s for the people who don’t want to live in Hong Kong, maybe people who have been protesting,"" says Dr Lutter. ""If they leave, it might be off Beijing’s back.”

“In terms of the brain drain or outflow of capital, China has 1.4 billion people who can move to Hong Kong with their capital and their companies,"" adds Ko. ""No matter how many people leave Hong Kong, those vacancies will be filled up in no time.”

And perhaps, in a way this has been done before – albeit in a more organic way. “In the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies, our parents and our parents’ parents fled China to come to Hong Kong and they helped each other, gave jobs to each other, lent money to each other, that’s how we started our lives here,” says Ko.

“We want to provide an option for Hong Kong people to leave Hong Kong, but to carry on with their lifestyles and continue to develop their careers and build their families in countries that are democratic and free.”",,/r/europe/comments/hkn0dp/how_britain_could_become_home_to_a_new_hong_kong/fwtm62w/,quixotic_cynic,1593796701

If cyprus had 2 frigates in the area when the turkish drillship entered its eezthey could have blocked it. The turkeys only choice would have been to either sink it or leave. If they sunk it then greece and the eu would intervene. Greece militeraly and eu economicaly. 

In any case which the turkish airforce would actually hit cyprus it would never use all 300 planes for fear of greece inrervening with their 290. best turkey could spare is 40 - 50, in which case 20 jets are a deterence.

You are also getting it wrong. The cypriot army wouldnt be amillitary detterence. It would be a **diplomatic deterence.** The diplomatic cost of sinking a cypriot frigate would be unaffordable or at least very high, unlike the military cost.

Now, the UK has two options:

1. Let no wares in.
2. Let all wares in.

The first one obviously would cause starvation.

The second one would cause third world countries to produce whatever they want at whatever quality standard they want and import it into the UK without any checks or tolls. Obviously these wares would be way cheaper than locally produced ones, making the latter no longer viable.

""Prior to the crisis, countries in CESEE, especially EU members, enjoyed significant capital inflows (Figure 9),
with FDI being the most important component (Figure 10). Large FDI investments underpinned the growth model of CESEE countries. As a result, exports increased rapidly. The capital stock was upgraded with more productive assets allowing for technology transfers to CESEE economies. Resulting higher incomes generatedmore domestic demand and domestic investment. Large foreign banks saw growth possibilities and high returns in the region and increased their presence, both through local subsidiaries and by lending cross-border to 
corporates. This helped domestic financial markets development and allowed corporates in the region to increase leverage.
These large net capital inflows allowed economies to increase significantly current consumption and sustain 
investment. Significant cross-border lending to many CESEE countries through foreign-bank subsidiaries and 
directly to corporates further weakened the relationship between investment and domestic savings. The ensuing 
increase in current consumption, along with investment, happened due to expectations of continuing rapid 
economic growth along the convergence path to high-income EU members. This borrowing against future incomes further strengthened economic growth and domestic demand. With the advent of the financial crisis, capital flows to the region, both gross and net, collapsed and have remained at a lower level ever since. The largest decline came from inward FDI, which was reduced to a third
(EIB, 2016). This decline dealt a hard blow to corporate investment in CESEE, not only through its direct effect but also through an indirect impact: FDI has a certain catalytic effect on domestic investment that has been reduced with this decline.""",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/hjb4cw/macron_wants_greater_european_involvement_in/fwslsg6/,Adenddum,1593774110

It's applied flexibly, of course. A country with a deficit greater than 3% of GDP, or debt greater than 60% of GDP, can join the EU. But it is required to show progress towards meeting the targets, and a firm plan for doing do. I expect if Scotland could get its deficit down and show a clear path to reducing the debt it would be welcomed. But Scotland's onshore deficit gap with the rest of the UK has been growing, the UK has increased spending, oil has collapsed again and Covid is going to increase deficits enormously.

In this aspect, I only ask that this part of history be taught in Belgian schools as part of their history program, doing the contrary would be negationist (in the sense of trying to hide the past). Other countries have monuments and special days to remember other crimes against humanity such as slavery or the holocaust, I don't know why Belgium couldn't do the same. 

Murder cases doesn't work exactly like crimes against humanity, it was just an analogy.

And one doesn't choose the country they're born in or the privileges or disadvantages they're born with, but one must live with one's own country's history.

He pissed off the environmentalists by doing to little, pissed off the working class by doing too much, issued some unpopular economic reforms to bump growth, but not get anything actualy noticeable. And on Europe, for all his attempt, Europe failed to deliver.

Maybe now that Germans have exited the liberal fold, he can pivot on social policy and direct government intervention in economic growth, but there is a big risk that it will be high-jacked into supporting his own backers and just solidifying his reputation of detached banker-boy.

3969,"&gt; Considering that white people (rich and poor) are a lot less likely to go to uni

I'm not sure this was the grandiose victory you expected it to be, this is literally an argument for why scholarships really should be given explicitly to white people if anything. Though I don't think they should be given at all, but especially should never be a race based requirement. 

You need to look at the disparity of what you linked to see the affect poverty has on a race. Black males go to higher education at a rate of 78% and 67% for non-free and free school meals, respectively. Meaning poverty results in a 14% reduced chance in going to higher education.

The same parameters for white males are 46% to 19%. This means poverty reduces chance of higher education at a rate of 61% for white males. 

Can you answer my original question though?

4204,"Mini-rant / story time:  
2-3 years back, I had an error in Steam, leaving games completely downloaded (as per file size and anything actually being transmitted) but somehow the download wouldn't stop and Steam wouldn't recognize the game files as complete (and they seemingly weren't - so I couldn't manually install the games either). 
Tried everything from clearing cashes, resetting the internet connection, switching ports, download regions, game-files, system changes, re-installing steam of course ...  
Whenever I DID manage to completely download and install the games (YAY!), the very next update to the game files would result in the same problem all over again (Nay..).  
You really don't want to know how often I re-downloaded the three games that gave me the most trouble. The three games in question? Kingdom Come Delieverance (not currently installed but Steam tells me it's 50gb), Pathfinder Kingmaker (44gb) .. oh, and good ol' lil' *ARK* (comfy at *150gb* currently...).  

My internet speed was 1.8 mbps then (paid for 6mbps, iirc).  

You do the math how long each download took.  
It was literal months of fun in the glorious #Neuland... hmpf!
And to top it off: My ISP kept telling me they couldn't deliever the actual paid for speed because 'it's a Telekom issue' and Telekom kept saying 'the last 100m to your house aren't up for higher speeds - nothing we can do, sorry not sorry'. Weeks of bitching later, a technican showed up (of course whenever he had the gusto to do so..) and it took him ~20 minutes of typing on his pad to get me at least 4-5 mbps steady. 
German Customer-Service at its finest.  

(note: The issue with Steam somehow resolved itself later, never found out the actual cause, still suspect it was a glitchy steam update - but I *do* still break into a cold sweat whenever ARK updates - so like every second day - and I still haven't touched KCD out of pure frustration...)",Germany,/r/europe/comments/hjq438/germany_in_the_eu_on_the_1_july_2020_germany_took/fwqzct2/,AeonLibertas,1593730675

No problem, it's not my main language either. I still struggle with the same thing as well at times.

\&gt;The goal in our project were watersoluble biopolymers.

Biodegradability in water is a really interesting topic, especially with the growing problem of microplastics.

Just so I am clear with the way it works: if the polymer is completely enveloped in water, the mineral layer will at first absorb water until it reaches it's maximum capacity. But what happens afterwards? I suppose the expansion of the outer mineral layer induces stresses in the coating, leading to crack formation and a gateway for the water to decompose the polymer (similar to how rust starts cracking). Maybe it also works different, mineral coating is actually a bit of an unknown field for me.

I am currently studying Bionics with specialisation in materials, and we did talk about coating and surface treatments a decent amount, but not using minerals. A quick research led me to mineral paints, where alkali silicate is used as a binder for the pigments and directly connects to the substrate (if it is siliceous, which polymers aren't). So I am a bit unsure how the barrier layer is actually attached to the polymer. But this might be confidential information, so if there are any industry restrictions, please don't tell me about it. :D

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, hearing about your old project and getting a bit of extra insight on what is discussed/researched in the industry was fantastic. Thanks alot!

4312,"As i've posted before: The thing to watch is the infection rate in specific areas. 
&gt; 
&gt; People don't really understand just how big the US is. Many areas of the US are just now getting exposed to the virus which then leads to additional herd exposure. I'm not talking about major cities, i'm talking the rural outreach. There's many many counties (counties are areas of land within a state) which have zero cases reported. That's right, there are still areas of the US without a single recorded case and they have not been practicing all of these rules.
&gt; 
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/wvKFh16.png
&gt; 
&gt; France being infected early is just like a single 2-3 states being exposed in the USA. Most EU countries are heavily connected by public transportation which can be an initial stop to the spread once it's started. Those who were infected early and rely on it now become herd immune and put things at a stand still. The US has majority of private transportation with many rural areas completely isolated from urban public transportation hubs until it occurs.
&gt; 
&gt; The US also has every single state doing testing for their residents and reporting all of those together for the total. Look independently at state data and you'll see every initial major state is trending downward.
&gt; 
&gt; Pretending to think comparing the US as a whole compared to another country is a good comparison is laughable. Did the US handle it poorly? One could easily argue they did. Are they recovering? One can easily argue they are recovering much better than expected.

We saw that was not the case, with the Baltic legions that served willingly on the side of the Nazis, whatever you say about conscription. If that was conscription, why was there no such conscription in Poland, for example? Obviously the Baltic states were considered a different situation, for the Nazis to even consider conscription there.
Then you asked to show you willing participation in the Holocaust by the Baltic states. I showed you information from Yad Vashem organisation in Israel, which shows that Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians did conduct their own massacres of Jews and it was not just the Nazis.
Next you asked me to educate you on examples of celebrations in the Baltic states of Wermacht units and I showed you examples of celebrations of Waffen-SS Baltic units.
On every point you asked about I showed you evidence from non-Russian sources. We can go like that all day but if you are going to ignore the main evidence I show and try to find loopholes in the details and call it Russian propaganda, then this whole discussion will be pointless.
I understand that you hate the Russians. I can see the reasons for that, altough I must say that still hating a whole people after 75 years for the actions of Stalin, from whom even the Russians suffered greatly, is strange to say the least.

Stop clowning around. 

Nobody, literally **NOBODY** that knows anything about the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus is mad about Turkey invading the island to prevent an ethnic cleansing - how the fuck can anyone say that's a bad thing? The world was behind you in the first invasion. I am too.

What you pathetically somehow fail to grasp is the fact that Turkey invaded a *second* time and did what it accused Greece of trying to do - split the island into twos, with half being under military occupation to this very day, ethnically cleansed the north part from Greek Cypriots and then unbalanced the demographics of the island by inviting settlers from the mainland. 

How can you defend this? In what kind of abusive home did you grow up to be so indescribably nationalistic as to defend the second invasion and post partition of the island with an armed force? Maybe not you in particular but others from your country. This is why nobody likes what Turkey did with Cyprus.

4465,"&gt;Unless you actively demolished the powerplant, you are then simply wasting the investment.

I don't really get what you are saying here. Building a giant reactor with all the quite expensive materials and processes that go with that due to the high security measures does create quite a bit CO2 and the reactor does need some time to ""save"" all that CO2 back by producing energy with less CO2 than other sources

&gt;Same carbon costs apply to renewables, as they also require infrastructure, in fact far larger infrastructure to produce the same amount of power.

They do, however, a solar panel can be built within a really short time frame. So if I decide to build them now, then they'll have at least 9 years to produce energy at 0 carbon cost to regain that initial carbon cost. With a nuclear plant, it would have at most 1-2 years, if we would start building now. But probably it would finish way beyond 2030 and thus wouldn't be helpful at all in reaching the 2030 goal of carbon neutrality.

&gt;Again decomissining and shuttign down nuclear powerplants isnt the same as them silently going poof and disappearing.

Again: I am not against keeping the nuclear reactors we have on the line. It's more about the immediate need to reduce carbon emissions really really fast. To do that by using more nuclear power, we would have needed to start designing and building new plants in the 2000s and 2010s. 

And again, I think you are a bit too optimistic regarding SpaceX and solar shades. I of course hope you are right, because that would be a huge help. But I think it is a bit too ambitious and until we actually make it work, we should definetely focus on other ways to immediately reduce emissions as fast as possible.",,/r/europe/comments/hjq438/germany_in_the_eu_on_the_1_july_2020_germany_took/fwq70p3/,I_haet_typos,1593716566

**(The Sun, 03/09/1974) ""What happened in Cyprus during the Coup D'etat, can not be named, it can only be called as dirty and inhuman.""**

**(French Soir, July 24, 1974) ""The Greeks burned Turkish mosques and set fire to Turkish homes in the villages around Famagusta. Defenseless Turkish villagers who have weapons live in an atmosphere of terror and they evacuate their homes and go and live in tents in the forest. The Greeks actions are a shame to humanity.""**

**(IL Giorno, January 14, 1964) ""Right now we are witnessing the exodus of Turkish Cypriots from the villages. Thousands of people abandoning their homes, land, herds. Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This time the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the statues of Plato do not cover up their barbaric and ferocious behavior. ""**

**( P. F. Peters, Former Ambassador of Australia to Ankara, 1994) If any genocide or ethnic cleansing has taken place in Cyprus, this has always been carried out by the Greeks. The abortive coup of 1974, organized by EOKA and Greek military junta in Athens, aimed at elimination of the Turkish Cypriots from the Island. Turkey intervened to protect them and prevent Enosis.Since that date, the island has been peaceful and free of bloodshed.**

One of your many lies

**On April 17, 1991, Ambassador Nelson Ledsky testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ""most of the 'missing persons' disappeared in the first days of July 1974, before the Turkish intervention on the 20th. Many killed on the Greek side were killed by Greek Cypriots in fighting between supporters of Makarios and Sampson.""**

**On Nov. 6, 1974, Ta Nea reported that dates from the graves of Greek Cypriots killed in the five days between July 15-20 were erased in order to blame these deaths on the subsequent Turkish military action.**

**On March 3, 1996, the Greek Cypriot Cyprus Mail wrote: ""(Greek)**

**Cypriot governments have found it convenient to conceal the scale of atrocities during the July 15 coup in an attempt to downplay its contribution to the tragedy of the summer of 1974 and instead blame the Turkish invasion for all casualties. There can be no justification for any government that failed to investigate this sensitive humanitarian issue. The shocking admission by the Clerides government that there are people buried in Nicosia cemetery who are still included in the list of the 'missing' is the last episode of a human drama which has been turned into a propaganda tool.""**

**On Oct. 19 1996, Mr. Georgios Lanitis wrote: ""I was serving with the Foreign Information Service of the Republic of Cyprus in London....

4517,"**The plan was drawn up in the 1980s by the General Staff of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). It envisaged a division of Bosnia into two spheres of interest, leading to the creation of a Greater Serbia and Greater Croatia. The Muslims were to be subjected to a final solution: more than 50% of them were to be killed, a smaller part converted to Orthodoxy, while an even smaller part - those with money, of course - was to leave for Turkey, by way of a so-called ""Turkish corridor."" The aim was to cleanse Bosnia-Herzegovina completely of the Muslim nation and to divide the country along the river Vrbas. The very name of Bosnia was to disappear. This was the aim behind the creation of ""Republika Srpska.""**

 The common objective of the joint criminal enterprise was to ethnically recompose the territories targeted by the Bosnian-Serb leadership by drastically reducing the proportion of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats through expulsion. The Chamber finds that the crimes of deportation and forced transfer were the original crimes of this common objective. Mr Krajišnik gave the go-ahead for the expulsion programme to commence during a session of the Bosnian-Serb Assembly when he called for [and I quote], ""implementing what we have agreed upon, the ethnic division on the ground"".

&gt;This was stated by the President of the Competition and Market Authority, Roberto Rustichelli, at the hearing in the European Union's Political Commission of the Chamber, underlining that ""this is a phenomenon that takes on a further problematic implication in the case of countries alongside such unfair tax practices the claim of strict budgetary rigor from countries from which resources drain "". In short, systems that ""implement aggressive tax practices that damage the economies of other Member States and which, also thanks to these practices, record very high growth rates"".

&gt;Unfair tax competition at a European level ""involves damage to Italy which can be estimated at between 5 and 8 billion dollars a year"", the President of the Authority also quantified. Some research, explained the number one of Antitrust, ""estimate that, due to unfair tax competition at European level, the Italian tax authorities lose the possibility of taxing over $ 23 billion in profits: 11 billion in profits are moved to Luxembourg, over 6 billion in Ireland, 3.5 billion in the Netherlands and over 2 billion in Belgium.

The study is enough to show that there were T-cell responses earlier, that these are stronger in affected people and that these strong responses are more prevalent than antibody tests suggest. With 8/31 having responses the error bars are quite wide in both directions, not even counting that blood donors are not representative of the general population. The question of how strong the defence is also open: antibodies has so far protected everyone against reinfection. We do not know if that is true for t-cells, even if it is almost guaranteedly better than no protection.

Good news, but hard to draw conclusions. But coupled with the earlier studies with T-cell responses and no antibodies it adds something new.

The hidden and blunt insinuations targetting Germany are really ignorant to say the least. 

FACTS
(I hope you may still know what facts are?) 

Every six months a different member state holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The presidency rotation takes place on 1st January and 1st July each year.

Each Presidency works closely with the two other member states:
the one that preceded it and the one that will follow it.
This partnership is known as the ‘trio Presidency’.

Those three determines long-term objectives and draws up a programme containing the major issues the Council will tackle over the next 18 months.
To this end, each of the three member states draws up its own six-month programme.

The main purpose of the trios lies in ensuring that there is a smoother transition between presidencies and that the  continuity and effectiveness of the Council's work is enhanced over the long term. ",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/hjq438/germany_in_the_eu_on_the_1_july_2020_germany_took/fwpaze3/,Marie-Jacqueline,1593701840

4726,"Adoption is an alternative, if you adopt you will avoid those early years that are probably most annoying, 

what is on Japans mind that I think Finland should also consider, is opening up the country to immigrants that contributes to the economy and are netto tax payers.

if I am not wrong, eg. East Asians are known to be highly competitive in school and get good jobs, 

according to the American Bureau of Labor Statistics, Asian avg. salary is higher than whites.

https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2018/asian-women-and-men-earned-more-than-their-white-black-and-hispanic-counterparts-in-2017.htm

also Jewish people are known to be very competitive in schools.

these groups of people are highly compatible with Western culture.

I also believe, people pretty much world wide that are highly educated as a whole are more compatible with Western values (with some exceptions, like that ISIS leader who holds a PhD).

so I wouldn't mind educated people world wide that can easily find a job in Finland, come here, I don't care if they are Black, White, Asian, African, Middle Eastern.

we should calculate on how long it will take for a particular immigrant with a particular degree and language skills will take to be integrated into the workforce, some industries are more prone to be English than others (eg. IT)

Also schools needs to focus more on educations that actually leads to people using their education in the workforce and have high employment rates, unis should not be free for educations like philosophy, art,

a society cannot afford free education for people studying ""hobby educations"".",Europe,/r/europe/comments/hjslru/in_2010_finland_had_a_fertility_rate_of_187_in/fwow5ky/,2024AM,1593694737

4739,"I agree with your wholeheartedly - the prices in some places in Germany (Munich for example) are just stupid.

The trouble is, all the focus goes on trying to get rent prices down (which aren't even that bad to begin with in comparison), so they introduce stupid laws like the Mietbremse which might go over well for the majority (because most rent and they have an apartment) but it makes the overall problem worse.  It doesn't help one bit with supply, and it actually increases demand as prices aren't allowed to rise and you suddenly don't just have 10 people who can afford the apartment anymore, you have 100.  It's just like in East German times when everyone could afford a banana, you just couldn't get one.

In places where there are these stupid prices, the solution is simple: build more apartments.  It's a basic supply and demand problem.  Instead of focusing on ""böse Investoren"" and how much money they are making from renters, they should be allowing these investors to fulfill the housing demands of the city.  So instead of focusing on rent control, they should focus on city planning, which is their actual job.  Taller buildings, opening up land to build with appropriate infrastructure etc.

Once that happens, prices will come down to a sensible level.

That said, I don't think that is the only reason German's don't buy.  It's a cultural thing.  The idea of ""gotta get on the housing ladder!"" just simply don't exist here.  Even in places where it's very cheap to buy, people still rent instead.  This causes all sorts of problems, like people not having enough money for rent when they retire because where they live has become sought after, or people actively trying to stop the city becoming nicer or receiving investment (example, new runway at Munich airport) because they think it will drive their rent up.  Both wouldn't be a problem if people just owned their own home.",,/r/europe/comments/hjq438/germany_in_the_eu_on_the_1_july_2020_germany_took/fwow9dw/,Hutcho12,1593694792

France is not in any country that didnt ask for its assistance. UN recognized governments and all. There are multiple terrorist organisations working in Africa, and there's a huge immigration movement from there. Would be dumb if the French just let terrorists reach their country this easily.

But a trade imbalance is in itself the result of other imbalances, mainly too much governmental spending, but also the lack of a business friendly environment, lack of educated workforce, etc. Using the currency devaluation to compensate for these imbalances is putting dirt under the carpet.

I guess you're right that ""black zero"" is misleading because every budget per definition has to have a zero at the end, the thing is that Germany had been hitting the black zero without taking up more debt and thus been *very* slowly chipping away at its total debt.

4874,"&gt;nuclear results in much less death and damage than coal.

You linked a source that said radiation from coal is 50ish times less dangerous than lightning strikes and even then only for people living close to the plant (which are a non issue). It doesn't really matter wether something is a non issue, or an even smaller non issue.

The thing is, nuclear accidents on a global scale are of course relatively meaningless. But on a local scale, it becomes a massive issue, as opposed to coal plant radiation, which is again, pretty much a non issue.

&gt; How much radiation? Compare that with your average coal plant and what it does 24/7 (fine particles, radiation, CO2)

You're looking at one issue of nuclear vs all issues of coal, of course coal wil lcome up on top.

That is not true. All the big Greek islands (Corfu, Zante, Kefalonia, etc) of the Ionian sea got 100% EEZ. Some very small islands like the [Diapontia Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapontia_Islands) and [Strofades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strofades) got reduced EEZ. Such a deal could also happen for Kastelorizo if Turkey was negotiating in good faith...

In my opinion and I think for most Greeks, it would be unacceptable to have Creta, Rhodes, Kos, Chios, Lesbos, and all the other big islands of the Aegean sea without full EEZ.

The best move Turkey can make is vote Erdogan out, vote in a pro-EU and pro-NATO leader who will reform back the constitution so the president doesn't have autocratic powers, reach a deal for Cyprus and stop the illegal drilling in Cyprus' EEZ. That will benefit Turkey greatly.

The alternative is continue on this reckless path until economic sanctions are put on Turkey by the EU and US. That will destroy the economy in seconds. Out of the Customs union, out of the EU candidacy, and eventually out of NATO. And knowing the US, it wouldn't surprise me if they start funding Kurdish insurrectionists who could eventually break off to form Kurdistan.

5157,"Central bank had quite high interest rates back than, they were trying to control inflation which was supposedly from ‘excessive’ power of labor unions and an ‘excessively’ centralized wage bargaining system, which resulted in strong wage-push inflation. 

So the central bank theory does not hold water.

I can't remember where it was but during the lockdown a large group of armed people went to a city hall or whatnot. The politicians didn't call the cops and tell them to bring their military equipment, they discussed legislation to prevent guns from being brought into the building.

Racism in Europe is very different from racism in USA. And it is also very different from region to region. In countries like France and UK you have significant black minorities, because of their colonial past, those are somewhat similar to US. However central, eastern, balkan European countries never had any colonies and industrial scale slavery. Those countries are racially homogenous as it gets. Which translated to complete misunderstanding of what racism means to citizens of each respective country and heated arguments about it here on Reddit and IRL. Add to the mix unprecedented migration from Africa and middle East in last few years into Europe, which has been a humanitarian disaster, where desperate people do desperate things, causing a lot of troubles for local citizens. Giving them justified (from their POV) reasons to feel strongly and negatively about these migrants based on their race and/or religion.

As for gypsies I wrote this the other day about it from central Europe perspective:

&gt;Them poor souls have been wandering Europe, minding their own business  and got trapped on outskirts of modern society and it's rules, which  never considered nomadic lifestyle. Nazis tried to straight out  exterminate them and those left were put out of sight by communists...

This problem has been created by oppressive regimes and dropped on young independent countries after fall of USSR, which had a lot of other problems to deal with than forgotten out of sight minority. However they are people too and since they were no longer getting paid by commies to stay out fo sight, their living conditions in ghettos deteriorated and again, desperate people do desperate things. Citizens of respective countries don't feel like it's their problem, since it was not created by them. And since Gypsies look and speak different, xenophobia and prejudice escalate quickly into racist and invaders rhetorics.

*TL;DR: Racism in Europe is different than in US for many reasons. It also differs greatly between countries. That's why there is a clusterfuck of misunderstanding and heated arguments here and in real life and EU politics.*

5306,"Two things that put Shadow economy of Italy in prespective.

&gt;First, it was always there even when Italy was doing better than EURO4. 

&gt;Second, in regards to taxing shadow economy for example, people in low-wage informal employment may not pay income tax, but also don't receive social benefits. As a result, the % of unemployed people in Italy who effectively receive unemployment benefits is really low. Usually people at the lower end of the labour market receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, and informal employment is mostly low-wage.

A thing about how Italians are not actually 3x richer than Dutch(Also Slovenians dont have 20k more in wealth than dutch per capita, that would have given it away)

&gt;Although private wealth is lower in Italy, wealth distribution is more equal; in Germany and Austria, wealth is more heavily concentrated in richer households. One of the main reasons for this is that private-property ownership plays a greater role in Italy. This has a lot to do with the relative underdevelopment of the public safety net: social and co-operative housing, which provides many people in Germany and especially in Austria with affordable housing of a reasonable size, is rare. Social housing and co-operatives do not however count as private assets, even if people there live occasionally more comfortably than in Italian condominiums of poor standard. But it remains simply wrong to say that Italians are wealthier than Germans or Austrians.

&gt; Graph: https://www.socialeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png

""We may be wealthy as a country, but it is not the case for the citizens"" 

&gt;This is just wrong on every level. Take financial assets for example where Dutch have almost double the italian assets . [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_financial_assets_per_capita) 

&gt;Or disposable income where Netherlands household has 6000 dollars higher yearly disposable income than Italy [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income)



""but the Italian government needs to fix it's finances internally instead of expecting other nations to help them. Expecting others to pay is just selfish and isn't going to get them any support from ""frugal"" nations.""

&gt;I think that would be the best solution but we would have to dismantle euro. But, since euro is a big benefit for northern countries I doubt that will happen.

Europe pretty well have black people, and depending the areas they do have conflictions.

When you walk down the streets of the Genoa it is not nice to see black mobs group after the streets of restaurants with wine drinking old europian bourgeois people. Neither it is fun to go to Turkish residency area in Germany and hooded balkan guys coming up to you to sell drugs.

You can add when local people are working hard not getting enough, the hate through the arabian chicks with stuffed bags through the streets of prague. 

People use ""racism"" not just for the real racism, but for every little offend they do get. This is pretty accelerating with bigotry as well for racism. 

Once I was sitting down with my bacpack is next to me, to the stairs of a square in Ljubljana. Cops came and asked me questions as if I am an illegal person. I am pretty sure if I was blonde, tall and white skinned I wouldnt be interrogated.

5468,"There are no laws that prevent police officers from being criminally prosecuted. You may be thinking of Qualified Immunity which applies when someone sues an officer.

In terms of criminally prosecuting police officers, it rests solely on the local prosecutor. The criminal justice system is extremely decentralized in the US. As a result, each county elects a prosecutor (aka a District Attorney or State Attorney). Whether a prosecutor chooses to prosecute a cop is based solely on their relationship with the police and the voting public. If a prosecutor goes after cops, then they will damage that relationship. Which in turn will make it difficult for the prosecutor to work with police in the future to secure convictions. Since the prosecutor has been blacklisted by the police, they will most likely lose their next election to someone who is ""tough on crime."" The incentive structure is completely messed up in these local governments. And the relationships between prosecutors, police, and local governments are toxic.

But let's assume that the prosecutor tries to hold the police accountable. At the end of the day, the decisions on whether or not to convict rests solely on the jury - 11 random people from the community. Most of these people believe that police are just doing their job. They will vote ""not guilty.""

This is why police reform in the US is so difficult. There are no laws that prevent police from being charged with crimes. But there is a Byzantine and anachronistic criminal justice system that is so decentralized that it makes it almost impossible to implement sweeping reforms.

EDIT: Also local elections have abysmally low turnout, as low as 20% in many places.

&gt; Eva Anna Paula Hitler (née Braun; 6 February 1912 – 30 April 1945) was the longtime companion of Adolf Hitler and, for less than 40 hours, his wife. Braun met Hitler in Munich when she was a 17-year-old assistant and model for his personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann.

But what was the manner of their first encounter, you might ask?

&gt; Eva Braun probably met Hitler for the first time in October 1929, a few weeks after starting her job.  She was apparently working late, organizing papers, when Hoffmann introduced her to one ""Herr Wolf"" and asked her to fetch some beer and sausages for him and his friend, and for herself as well, from a nearby restaurant.  During the meal together that followed, the stranger was ""devouring"" her ""with his eyes the whole time,"" and he later offered her ""a lift in his Mercedes.""  She refused.  Finally, before she left the studio, Eva Braun's boss, Hoffmann, asked her: ""Haven't you guessed who that gentleman is; don't you ever look at our photos?""  After she said no, Hoffmann said: ""It's Hitler!  Adolf Hitler.""...It is certainly unclear why Hoffmann would have introduced his prominent friend and Party colleague under the fake name ""Wolf"".

90% of that 10% deficit is interest payments on debt and not public spending of the state. Take 1990 for example, where italy primary deficit is 0.7%, while actual deficit was 9.6%.

The interest rates were so high because inflation average in those years is 5-6 %. Actual real deficit, was much lower than 9.8 %. In 1990 for example Italy has 6.5 % inflation, bringing the real deficit to 3.1(Including the interest rate payments).

5580,"1. The most important part is preparation. They modify the rules in a way that favors them in the current situation. They can do that as they single-handedly control all branches of power. Before every major election in Russia, rules of elections are always tweaked. And for this particular ""vote"", all rules were invented from scratch in a completely unprecedented manner. Those rules violate basically every principle of the Russian election legislation, it's the most easily falsifiable ""vote"" in the modern Russian history since the Soviet period.

2. They use their total media control and all their financial resources to sway the public opinion. They need many people to legitimately support them. And they also need their opponents to not show up, so they push ideas like ""everything is predetermined"" to them through other available channels. In a dictatorship with no media freedom, media resources available to the government and to their opposition are vastly different, so it makes a huge difference, obviously.

3. Widespread use of the ""administrative resource"". Employees of the public sector are a huge part of the Russian society. Those people are literally forced to vote by their employers. As they are extremely more likely to be conformist due to their social status, you don't even need to tell them how to vote, they'll generally choose the right option anyway. Also, prisoners, soldiers, etc.

4. Doesn't apply to the current vote, but if there are candidates and the procedure for their nomination, you just make this procedure impossible for people you don't like. The safest option is to filter all unwanted elements beforehand. You can't vote for a candidate who is not even present on the ballot. You also frequently get a bonus of this candidate's supporters becoming upset and not showing up for the election.

5. If the above points together are enough, you don't really need to falsify anything (see Putin's 2018 election). If not, you start your falsifications. Empty ballots are used to add the needed percentages. This is a risky procedure used as a last resort and generally prevented or at least made public by independent observers. There are some exceptions: early voting (usually for people with disabilities and other reasons preventing them from coming to the polling station) is not controlled at all and always shows great results; local election commissions in places like prisons - no observers, 100% wanted results are commonly achieved. Those places usually contribute fairly little to the overall picture, but every bit counts. But it's also very difficult to cover all possible commissions by trusted observers, as the state obviously doesn't want that. Major cities like Moscow are usually well-covered by observers, falsifications there are either impossible or ruin the image of the government because they are always made public.  
However, the current ""vote"" is very different. First, the vote happened over 7 (seven!) days, first 6 days are early voting, and more than half of the population voted during it. There is no control there whatsoever, you can draw any results, it cannot be verified. Second, there were virtually no observers this time anywhere, which makes it possible to do anything anywhere. Take, for example, Ufa. Turnout 75% in all commissions except a singe one where there was an observer, where the turnout amusingly happens to be 25%. You judge if it's just a coincidence. Third, online votes in Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod.

)

&gt; Animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil-fuel energy than production of plant protein while yielding animal protein that is only 1.4 times more nutritious for humans than the comparable amount of plant protein, according to the Cornell ecologist's analysis.
&gt;
&gt; Tracking food animal production from the feed trough to the dinner table, Pimentel found broiler chickens to be the most efficient use of fossil energy, and beef, the least. Chicken meat production consumes energy in a 4:1 ratio to protein output; beef cattle production requires an energy input to protein output ratio of 54:1. (Lamb meat production is nearly as inefficient at 50:1, according to the ecologist's analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics. Other ratios range from 13:1 for turkey meat and 14:1 for milk protein to 17:1 for pork and 26:1 for eggs.)
&gt;
&gt; Animal agriculture is a leading consumer of water resources in the United States, Pimentel noted. Grain-fed beef production takes 100,000 liters of water for every kilogram of food. Raising broiler chickens takes 3,500 liters of water to make a kilogram of meat. In comparison, soybean production uses 2,000 liters for kilogram of food produced; rice, 1,912; wheat, 900; and potatoes, 500 liters.

That's why even in the US your speech is restricted if you use it to help terrorists.

&gt;For example, U.S. law proscribes granting terrorists “advice or assistance derived from scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge.” The law comes after the USA PATRIOT Act’s section 805(a)(2)(b), which broadened the definition of “material support” to criminalize the act of providing terrorists with “expert assistance or advice.” There are even cases in which mere advocacy for terrorism is criminalized. In 2010, the Supreme Court’s Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project decision held that speech can be criminalized if it constitutes “advocacy performed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.”

5617,"That's not what I said, but I appreciate the laugh this comment gave me. Don't know what police shootings have to do with the statue of an old Belgian king that has been dead for a hundred years. Police shootings are everything but an issue in Belgium because our police basically isn't allowed to do anything to criminals. Much like the Belgian people if we defend ourselves we have more chance of going to jail than our assailant does. 

Now I already read your other comment where you said ""B-buh that's what he was implying!"", which again I wasn't. That's what you interpreted.

Removing this statue will not change anything. *Anything*. It won't change the damage his reign has done. It won't change that we as Belgians have a lot of our wealth due to colonisation and horrifying slavery. It won't grow the hands we severed back. It won't un-burn the Congolese towns, it won't take the bullet out of their chests. It won't change how people view Leopold II, good or bad, it won't make his name any less scathing on our history. No action like this will accomplish anything other than waste materials, time, and public attention.

It also won't change anything regarding racism. Nobody in Belgium is racist against the Congolese. Everybody in this country feels deep shame and regret for what has happened there, and we will forever be sorry for the atrocities that our royalty has allowed. You will never, *ever* find somebody in Belgium talking shit about the Congo. Not even in the worst white supremacist bars will you hear that.

That's because we hate Moroccans and gypsies. Jews also a little bit, but they usually don't bother us as much so we let them stay. And our hate for Moroccans has nothing to do with their race and everything to do with their over-representation in crime statistics and how we straight up have no-go zones because of them. They're not official zones, but spend more than a week in Antwerp or Brussels with somebody that knows those places and you'll find out what places to avoid soon enough. Not gonna lie, don't know what the deal is with gypsies though. Hating Gypsies just seems to be a European tradition of some sort.

&gt; There's a *huge* difference between killing an animal in some poverty ridden country, and assembly line style killing for no other reason than your tastebuds. 

Well meat has pretty important stuff like saturated fats and shit like that. It is not honest when you say its all about taste. 

&gt; What does it matter whether they're farm animals or not? 

Well, you know, because they exist for the purpose to be farmed :) 

&gt; You can feed more people by cutting out the middleman: animals. 

Let me skip this one. I strongly disagree but we need to discuss other things before this.

&gt; We eat animals for very simple reasons: they're tasty and we can't be bothered to change our ways. 

No I disagree. We eat animals because crop and animal farming go hand in hand. They are depending on each other, and this is taught in primary schools, just sayin'. At our current technological level it would be worse even for the environment to remove animals from the equation. 

Also I refute this theme where I am immoral for not wanting to get rid of animal husbandry. Or animal farming. Fuck that.

5663,"&gt;I'm sorry, what? How was this a core part of Brexit? When has the UK ever threatened to *weaponise* trade? 

Not my fault that you were not paying attention to the Brexit campaign. One of the core was that UK outside the EU would have better trade deals with the EU than inside. Furthermore the Brexit campaign always promised a deal, because the UK was so important to the EU. If that does not signal weaponized trade, than what? Especially now that we are clearly going for a no deal

&gt;Perhaps you mean the UK's intention to set it's own laws and regulations? How is that a threat? Do you think the UK is going to scrap all its labour and environmental protections? Despite the fact that it's has, and has long had, significantly *better* standards than the EU minimums? Or maybe you are worried about the UK propping up industries through state aid, despite having the best record in the EU for such activity relative to it's size (the worst offender, by far, being Germany...).

Now you are just bullshitting but feel free to have your fantasies. 

&gt;You must think that any country outside of the EU couldn't possible have good standards. Clearly without the all knowing, all wise leadership of the European Commission, we'd be an inferior society.

Well there is something called a Brussel effect. If you think that UK won't fall under that, than its clear you are fantasising here. Not me

&gt;Yes, because a binary world makes so much sense... Never mind that the EU's current relationships with other third countries is a spectrum, not an in-or-out. 

Yes a spectrum on how much in. UK wants both out and in. Which won't happen. 

&gt;This is fucking rich, the Swiss were fine with the status quo, they were't asking for anything. The EU has been trying to change the Swiss relationship for decades because they don't like that it constitutes a glaringly obvious counterargument to the suppose *inviolability* of the SM and 4 freedoms. 

No there were things like refugees that Swiss wanted to change. However the Swiss thought they could get more things that went against the EU principle. So rightfully the EU puts its foot down and didn't budge. Something you clearly think that the UK would not encounter. Seeing that a no deal is very likely I think you are wrong with that.

5745,"I've dreamed of studying/living in Europe since my childhood. As the word ""childhood"" suggests, it had nothing to do with politics - even when I was 9, I simply wanted to be part of new cultures and meet new people. It grew in me and kinda got out of control as I became an adult who now also got to see what kind of a country he lives so it turned into some sort of obsession: I just wanted to live in a country where I could be comfortable, simple as that. My work will be appreciated and paid well enough, I will feel myself free and calm etc... 

After so many years of nothing, I finally got the chance to go to Latvia as an exchange student. Even though I have an extremely limited budget which would prevent me from getting a visa, thankfully some of my relatives were eager to give a helping hand, so the biggest hurdle was overcome - all I needed to was now apply for the visa and just wait. 

Now the consulate says they won't accept any application before Aug 1 while I have to be in the country at the end of August at the latest and we are not even in the list of countries that are allowed to travel into EU so even having a visa would not matter at this point.

Sorry if this sounds so cringy and edgy but I feel devastated. When I was 17, I applied for Schengen to visit my girlfriend in Poland. They denied, my ex then left me because well, what was she supposed to do with a guy who can't even enter her country? Years later, this now. Imagine wanting to visit a beautiful city, growing up with the dream of doing that but not having means to do it at all. I feel so down and anxious now.

5750,"[Red Army soldiers don't believe in 'individual liaisons' with German women,"" wrote the playwright Zakhar Agranenko in his diary when serving as an officer of marine infantry in East Prussia. ""Nine, ten, twelve men at a time - they rape them on a collective basis.](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/01/news.features11).

*Beria and Stalin, back in Moscow, knew perfectly well what was going on from a number of detailed reports. One stated that ""many Germans declare that all German women in East Prussia who stayed behind were raped by Red Army soldiers"". Numerous examples of gang rape were given - ""girls under 18 and old women included"".*

*When gang-raped women in Königsberg begged their attackers afterwards to put them out of their misery, the Red Army men appear to have felt insulted. ""Russian soldiers do not shoot women,"" they replied. ""Only German soldiers do that."" The Red Army had managed to convince itself that because it had assumed the moral mission to liberate Europe from fascism it could behave entirely as it liked, both personally and politically.*

*The novelist Vasily Grossman, a war correspondent attached to the invading Red Army, soon discovered that rape victims were not just Germans. Polish women also suffered. So did young Russian, Belorussian and Ukrainian women who had been sent back to Germany by the Wehrmacht for slave labour. ""Liberated Soviet girls quite often complain that our soldiers rape them,"" he noted.

[In Photos: Russia Unveils New Military Mega-Church](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/27/in-photos-russia-unveils-new-military-mega-church-a70110)

&gt;The 95-meter cathedral, located on a sprawling military theme park and exhibition center near Moscow, is set to open its doors on May 9 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. 
&gt;
&gt;The cathedral drew widespread attention over the weekend when photos of its interior showed mosaics of President Vladimir Putin, Soviet leader Josef Stalin and the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine adorning the walls.

-

&gt; The cathedral's six golden domes are dedicated to the patron saints of each branch of the Armed Forces.

-

&gt;The images of military-related patron saints and other religious figures are also depicted on the cathedral walls.

-

&gt; In addition to these stained-glass windows, artisans have crafted a new Orthodox icon for the cathedral. Funding for the icon came from a personal donation by President Vladimir Putin.

-

&gt; The church’s parameters, including the height and width of its domes, will reflect key dates of World War II and the structure will feature multimedia stands dedicated to the 33 million Soviet soldiers who fought in the war.

5785,"&gt; Use trade as a weapon. It was a core part of Brexit after all.

I'm sorry, what? How was this a core part of Brexit? When has the UK ever threatened to *weaponise* trade? 

Perhaps you mean the UK's intention to set it's own laws and regulations? How is that a threat? Do you think the UK is going to scrap all its labour and environmental protections? Despite the fact that it's has, and has long had, significantly *better* standards than the EU minimums? Or maybe you are worried about the UK propping up industries through state aid, despite having the best record in the EU for such activity relative to it's size (the worst offender, by far, being Germany...).

You must think that any country outside of the EU couldn't possible have good standards. Clearly without the all knowing, all wise leadership of the European Commission, we'd be an inferior society. 

&gt; But the UK choosed to exit the EU internal market and the EU has been clear from the start that access to it is a nothing or everything deal. And now you are experiencing what it means.

Yes, because a binary world makes so much sense... Never mind that the EU's current relationships with other third countries is a spectrum, not an in-or-out. 

&gt; You call it bullying and thuggery, I call it caring for its members. 

Caring for it's members by threatening a very small, totally landlocked country that literally cannot circumvent the EU because of geography?

&gt; Switzerland thought it could bully the EU in getting a better treaty, EU only showed that its the stronger partner.

This is fucking rich, the Swiss were fine with the status quo, they were't asking for anything. The EU has been trying to change the Swiss relationship for decades because they don't like that it constitutes a glaringly obvious counterargument to the suppose *inviolability* of the SM and 4 freedoms. 

&gt; However already you guys are experiencing that the UK is not that powerful.

The UK never claimed to be that powerful, only that it could stand on it's own. And, like the Swiss, no amount of threats and thuggish behavior has made us change course.

You spin it as if Sarkozy had nothing to do with the subprime crisis. Do I need to remind you about the speech he gave after he came back from the USA, praising the *deregulation of the banking system*? He wanted to implement it in France and you were lucky that the crisis strike before he could do it, otherwise France would have completely sunk into the crisis.
  
Also he named his son at the head of the EPAD, one of the most outrageous move of a french president:
  
&gt;In 2009, Sarkozy was nominated to become the head of EPAD, the development agency for La Défense. Located in the Paris metropolitan area, La Défense is Europe's largest purpose-built business district, also visited by millions of tourists annually, with the EPAD agency managing an annual budget of more than one billion Euros. French and international newspapers ran stories examining the link between the nomination and Sarkozy's father's Presidency. Criticism has been made about the obvious lack of academic qualities and professional experience for such a high position. An online petition against the nomination received 10,000 signatures a day In October 2009, a survey found that 64% of French people opposed EPAD's hiring of Sarkozy.
  
&gt;The Times called the nomination an ""astonishing act of nepotism by Nicolas Sarkozy"" and said that ""Jean, who is repeating his second year of undergraduate law at the Sorbonne, after having repeated the first year, was elected to a Neuilly seat on the notoriously sleaze-ridden department council last year. He was immediately given the job of heading Dad's Union for a Popular Movement on the body.""

5832,"&gt; Like the UK will never do it.

Do what?

&gt; There are some good reasons why you want to have the ability to one sided stop the agreement in these things. For one, what if the UK suddenly massively changes its laws that is massively detrimental to EU companies. You want to have a big stick to stop that.

The UK's position has always been that any dis-alignment in regulation should come with a commensurate (i.e. proportional) and relevant response). E.g. if UK changes a law to make their production of say hair dryers unfairly competitive, the EU should be able to apply restrictions or tariffs on UK hair dryers. They should not be able to unilaterally cut of all market access for UK based insurance firms (which would be disproportionate and not at all relevant to the original egregious behavior).

&gt; If the UK didn't exit the EU, they did not have to fear this.

Now, note that the disagreement that the EU had with Switzerland had nothing to do with financial services, the Swiss regulatory regime was in complete compliance with the rules, the Swiss exchanges had done nothing wrong. But this was one area where the EU thought they could hurt with minimal blowback to themselves (ironically Swiss exchanges outperformed their EU counterparts when the access was cutoff).

So, while I can pay good money to eat the meat of a cow which has had a long and happy life, I can't pay good money to eat the meat of a cow that had a quick and painless death - and that bothers me. 

I have absolutely no issue eating meat - and have no intention to 'just stop'. I do, however, have an issue with the corners that are being cut to save money. I don't want meat to be cheap, or to foster an environment which encourages corner cutting. Quality of life and quality of death are at stake, and that matters more than cheap bacon. Punishments should be severe and rules should be draconian. 

If a company wants to get into the meat business there should be a very high threshold. That would ensure that meat would get on the market, but only from those high cost, upscale, ethical operations, which are willing to take on the risk and to do it correctly. If that means beef steak at a hundred dollars a pound, then I'll pay that.

Do you want to destroy statues of Qingis Khan or Julius Caesar? You could argue they did even worse things if you take into account the resources they had at the time. Or are they too old for you to care anymore about the lives they took and therefore the statues are fine? If that is the case then you are dismantling statues now based on emotional connection to the things the depicted person did, even though in the future Adolf Hitler will feel as distant as Qingis Khan.

By the logic people use almost every statue depicting a person born before 1800 in all cultures should be destroyed.

In 1941 Finland proved that refusing to stop around old borders (even to Churchill). Operation Barbarossa, starvation of Leningrad, karelian ethnocide, which finns dislike remembering.
