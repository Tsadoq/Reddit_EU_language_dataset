No, this is resisting arrest. If you watch the whole video you'll see that police uses force only in very specific circumstances.

129,"1. Wealth transfer is at least tangentially related to wealth hoarding, which is more what I'm getting at. The problem isn't the *transfer* of wealth, but rather that the wealth that California is generating is not being spread sufficiently to prevent the poverty caused by raising costs of living in an area. When a developer decides to build a housing district, they do so on profitability and not on the basis of human welfare. This creates a tendency among developers to make high-cost housing, as that allows them to both appeal to a higher income demographic *and* appropriate more wealth through charging rent. On top of that, large companies who base themselves in California (such as Google) pay next to nothing in any kind of taxes, which inhibits the ability of the state to incentivize low-cost housing, while housing costs in the areas near those businesses rise. 
2. That very much depends on whose estimates your looking at. A study done by LendingTree found that out of ~1.76 million homes across the SF Metropolitan area (which includes Oakland and Hayward among other cities), about 1.68 million are actually occupied, which leaves you with just under 100k vacant homes across a few cities. Which *is* a fairly low rate, but the fact that still so many homes are vacant should be a reason to ask why we force people to be homeless in such a wealthy area, and why we force so many people into poverty in order to maintain a home in the area they work.
3. There is not necessarily a ""very high demand"" for ""low-skill"" labor. Fresno County has an unemployment rate of just over 9%, whereas California overall has an unemployment rate of 4.1%. In the Central Valley, unemployment is on average twice what is in the state overall, even though our main industry is agriculture - a strong source of jobs for ""low-skill"" labor. Beyond that, even many natural citizens can't afford to attain the skills required for high-paying jobs because costs of living in college areas (nevermind the cripplingly high tuition costs) make it near impossible for working-class people to reliably get through school. Those who do typically get stuck with crippling debt, and wait several years to find a job in their field.",,/r/europe/comments/cihfs1/i_noticed_that_spain_and_california_are_very/ev8ee70/,DogFarmerDamon,1564277108

About him :

""On this last point, and contrary to the popular image he likes to give, Johnson is a refined man and with a huge culture which was making his colleagues pale with envy.""

About spreading fake news on european union :

""He was totally disarming, because he wasn't an aggressive ideologist for whom Europe was the absolute evil, the new Reich of a thousand years. No, more simply, it was a man without conviction that everything amused and who didn't care about the consequences of what he was writing or the wrong he was doing.""

And :

""His strength is to be devoid of real convictions, which makes him unpredictable. We consider in Brussels that he's capable of everything, even renounce Brexit if he sees his personal interest.""

So basically the difference with Trump is that he is actually cultivated and intelligent, but he seems to be lacking moral values and real convictions, and he is unpredictable (like Trump).",,/r/europe/comments/cij5ii/french_journalist_i_have_worked_near_boris/ev8fc4k/,LugosDies,1564277900

As long as it forces the country to do **exactly** as you like. 

&gt; I think Brexit is a gigantic mistake and if Labour is a pro-Brexit party (which they are) then a Remain party - Lib Dems - will get my vote. I'm not alone in that outlook.

Countries like people should be allowed to make mistakes, they of course should also be allowed to change their mind. Which is much closer to the Labour position in practice than the Lib Dem's. So given the also condescending 

&gt; Actually, I'm not sure of that at all as they don't seem to be able to find their arse with both hands.

May I assume that indeed you don't support democratic decision at all. And would much prefer either a benevolent dictator making all the ""smart"" decisions or just a technocratic form of governance. 

&gt; Calling someone right-wing because they disagree with Corbyn and Milne.

No, because they vote for a right-wing party while better alternatives exist. You don't see me calling people who vote SNP or Green right-wing. You do see me calling you right-wing for voting for a right-wing party.

&gt; You should get out and about and talk to those people who are hugely disaffected by the current Labour leadership (particularly it's pro-Brexit stance)

368,"&gt;Human rights primarily protect you against the government.

They don't protect anyone from jack shit. The United States, which is the foremost proponent of the UN and ""human rights"" goes around blasting entire countries to rubble and butchering millions of people with wild abandon. They start proxy war after proxy war after proxy war. Do you have any idea what's been going on in Yemen for the past few years? Saudi Arabia, America's close ally which receives tons of support from America in the form of financial gifts, trade dealings, military weapons &amp; training, has been systemically bombing and starving the entire nation of Yemen to death.

And just look at what's happening in supposedly ""enlightened"" western countries. The USA, Britain, France, etc, all of them are police states. Nobody has any privacy. French riot cops have spent the past several months viciously beating unarmed protesters in the streets, exactly like Hosni Mubarak's police did during the ""arab spring"" protests from several years back.

Western culture has become increasingly shallow and materialistic. It's becoming harder and harder to start a family. The media has turned everyone into a pleasure-obsessed, egoist-narcissist who only cares about scraping together enough money to buy their little smartphones and toys to play with. They've been tricked into thinking that starting a family and creating the next generation of people is nothing but a buzzkill, or worse, that it's evil because of ""sustainability concerns."" Do you really think the elites, the same class of people who start devastating wars all over the world and butcher millions of people, give a crap about the environment? 

&gt;You should think about how you would like to be treated

It doesn't matter how you and I would like to be treated. The bankers and their puppet politicians will treat us however they like to. They control everything, and ""human rights"" is just one example of how they fool you into thinking they are benevolent and care about your well-being.

Yes, of course I understand the same argument can be used by all sides here. We are having disagreement over definitions. Prosecution or persecution of homosexuality is obviously wrong. Being eligible for special privileges is entirely different thing. Not being eligible is not discrimination.


The whole point here is we are talking about people who made their homosexuality their only defining characteristics, for only that nobody won‚Äôt be respected.

Afaik nobody really knows what determines homosexuality.

&gt;Most scientists agree that it is unlikely that there is a single ""gay gene"" that determines something as complex as sexual orientation, and that it is more likely to be the result of an interaction of genetic, biological and environmental/cultural factors.

Animals? I never used ‚Äúnature‚Äù as argument. But as you brought it up 

&gt;a]lthough homosexual behavior is very common in the animal world, it seems to be very uncommon that individual animals have a long-lasting predisposition to engage in such behavior to the exclusion of heterosexual activities. Thus, a homosexual orientation, if one can speak of such thing in animals, seems to be a rarity.""

549,"Local food is bad? Bruh...

The state borders the Pacific Ocean, is full of rivers and lakes, it has rainforests, mountains, desert, farmland, forests, and more, which offers an abundance and variety of local produce that is matched by few. 

The San Joaquin Valley is the breadbasket of the country, and supplies food not just for the rest of the country, but exports Produce globally. 

It is home to Napa Valley (one of the best wine producing regions on the planet), San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Newport Beach, and other major destinations. 

The state has 90 Michelin Star restaurants, despite LA only recently being reviewed again, and the review guide holding a strong European bias. There is world class street food, food trucks, cheap eats, gourmet restaurants, food festivals, and more. 

The state has a long native, Spanish, Mexican, and other European history, which means that, in a sense, Latin flavors ARE the local food. But New California Cuisine is also local, and amazing. Defined as:

&gt;California cuisine is a food movement that originated in California. The cuisine focuses on dishes that are driven by local and sustainable ingredients with an attention to seasonality and an emphasis on the bounty of the region. The food is typically chef-driven.

Otherwise, the state is full of classically trained chefs who apply French technique and skill to local ingredients, elevating traditional California and American dishes to new levels. 

And California cuisine is further defined by mash-ups. Spanish cuisine is Spanish, but California cuisine is often an amalgamation of our local people and cultures. Roy Choi created the Korean Taco and started the gourmet food truck trend, bringing together the ingredients of two of the biggest and most influential inhabitants, as one such example. 

Spanish food is good. Like, really good. I‚Äôll eat jamon iberico all day. All the variety and simplicity of traditional tapas dishes are unquestioned, and Spanish chefs are masters of turning simple ingredients into elevated experiences. Spanish wine is amazing. 

But don‚Äôt disregard cuisine in California. Restaurants, chefs, produce, meat, wine ‚Äî it‚Äôs absolutely, 100% an international food destination.

If its the will of the people an entirely non-binding second referendum on the the same, a government organised and executed poll if you will, surely just supports the previously determined outcome? Why then are many MP's regularly having hernias arguing so fervently against any sort of secondary accounting, even a vote on a final proposed deal? Could it be that they're all desperately trying to maintain face for being revealed as the impotent children they are, unable to deliver on anything they claim and by virtue of the will of the people turning once again against them proving outright that they're at best just empty suits with a government pension?

No, surely its that the cost of such an vote would be prohibitive! Far better just to piss away a hundred or so billion a year and leave with no deal.

604,"&gt;No, but we werent tariffed over that...which kind of makes my point, this is doing something,   

It's doing something, it's provoking more of a response but it's not doing anything about independence which was the topic. I referenced the train  as another example of doing something without that relating directly to independence because I'm sure no one thought that would make Kosovo come back. It's just an act showing general animosity without doing anything about Kosovo's status. The same applies to the tariffs.  

&gt;Reaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States of the region, as set out in the Helsinki Final Act and annex 2   

I'm not sure what the whole point of this is supposed to be? I mean things change, countries change their minds, their stances, it's not forbidden to do that. Just mentioning the Helsinki accords points to how temporary they are since those included a full Yugoslavia so obviously EU members aren't literally committed to them otherwise they wouldn't recognise Slovenia, Croatia, etc.    

Even if the specific UN resolution you brought up didn't seem open ended about Kosovo's future status, I still wouldn't think of it as applying indefinitely.   

What is even a UN resolution? It's [actually not binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_resolution) and is internally referred to as a ""recommendation"". So... what do you expect? The world isn't ruled by UN resolutions. The UN left Kosovo's status open ended, it ruled its independence legal and ultimately it was just making recommendations.    

Kosovo's independence is illegal for Serbia's but from the point of view of the UN or many other countries.  

&gt;Specific resolutions, wars are more complicated than that.    

I'm sure that during a decade of fighting and massacring (not just by Serbia) the UN called to end that many times. Plus surely at some  past point FYR Serbia signed some resolution against violence and ethnic cleansing.    

&gt;Like what,except the train, which is hilarious if that's the only argument.     

The train, the derecognations. I'm not an expert but I'm sure some Kosovar or Albanian redditor could bring up more cases.    

&gt;We did everything we had to under the Brussels agreement, while we gained nothing and lost a ton of stuff.    

What did you have to do to fulfill the  Brussels agreement? Anyway if you're concerned about losses and gains then the current path shouldn't be looking attractive to you cause it doesn't have any gains.

&gt;It didn't do anything to pull them down though, a strongly worded letter isn't really anything,  

What do you expect them to do? They can't just invade Kosovo to enforce its trade policies. They could freeze the EU accession process but Kosovo hasn't done much to be frozen. They could tariff Kosovo but that would be an overreaction.    There isn't much else to do but call for talks and cooperation which is in everyone's benefit but apparently in no one's desires.   

You mention CEFTA but that's made up of non-EU members, so nothing the EU could do there.     


&gt;In the end of the day, don't care what they do, it will just be hilarious to read people complaining here that Russias and Chinese influence is growing in Serbia,    

I've heard that a lot from Serbs and honestly I think you're vastly overestimating how much anyone cares. Like I don't think the Western members and  the Eastern ones care as much about Bulgaria, Romania as you think they do about Serbia.  Even the UK   brexitting  is met with  ""Well if that's what you want then do it, we're not gonna make up some super privileged terms just for you"".   

So it's the same for Serbia. It's not that anyone hates it but if Serbia doesn't want to be in the EU no one's gonna force it against its will.

1. You have an agenda of actively denying English people the right to exist, be independent and be proud  
2. You are mentally ill (depression and self hatred)

Forget pricing. Pricing is not useful and it is never going to get the desired results. We need massive worldwide campaigns to change people and their approach to food and the environment.

903,"Ireland is an EU member, the EU will therefore pool its weight behind Ireland in this matter.

1. The GFA has been successfull in maintaining peace on the Island. Ireland and the EU value that greatly.

 Hence the EU will support Ireland strongly in keeping the GFA alive.

2. The GFA mandates an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

 Hence the EU will do what it can to keep the inner Irish border open.

3. You need customs controls to maintain the integrity of a regulatory and customs space.

4. Ireland is part of the EU's Single Market and Regulatory Space.

 The EU will therefore do what is necessary to realize customs controls whereever its Single Market and Regulatory space end.

 Therefore the GFA is very much also a EU matter because it means the EU won't tolerate the open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to become closed again, to allow customs controls there.

5. The UK government agrees that keeping the GFA alive is important.

6. The UK government is unable and or unwilling to say where else it wants that border with customs controls to be, only that it wants to leave the EU's Custom's Union and Regulatory space.

The UK has three options since the EU position won't change:

- Max Brexit...default no-deal outcome: Hard border where the EU Regulatory Space and Customs Union ends, meaning a hard border on the inner-irish border and the end of the GFA.

- Backstop: Northern Ireland (and possibly some Island in the Irish Sea) stay in the EU's Custom Union and regulatory space. 

 Yes this is very awkward in regards to Northern Ireland's place in the UK but thats just a negotiation issue for the EU which has Ireland's interests and the integrity of the Single Market as a higher priority. 

- The UK stays in the EU's Single Market.

 Basically a Brexit in  name only or no Brexit.

937,"LOL, ""open secret"" (facepalm).

ECB mission statement:
""The primary objective of the ECB‚Äôs monetary policy is to maintain price stability. The ECB aims at inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. ""
They even elaborate why they find critically important:
""... The objective of price stability refers to the general level of prices in the economy. It implies avoiding both prolonged inflation and deflation. Price stability contributes to achieving high levels of economic activity and employment by improving the transparency of the price mechanism. Under price stability people can recognise changes in relative prices (i.e. prices between different goods), without being confused by changes in the overall price level. This allows them to make well-informed consumption and investment decisions and to allocate resources more efficiently;
    reducing inflation risk premia in interest rates (i.e. compensation creditors ask for the risks associated with holding nominal assets). This reduces real interest rates and increases incentives to invest;
    avoiding unproductive activities to hedge against the negative impact of inflation or deflation;
    reducing distortions of inflation or deflation, which can exacerbate the distortionary impact on economic behaviour of tax and social security systems;

Are you really so dense that you cannot see that every sentence you use to defend homophobes actually applies to the LGBT community?

&gt; People who made sexuality their main characteristics will never be respected if it‚Äôs the only thing they‚Äôre known for. One can be respected for achievements, useful skills, good deeds etc not for sexuality. 

They didn't choose that themselves though. Apart from their sexual orientation, they might be respected for other achievements. However, they are hated because of this particular characteristic, and that's why they draw attention to it. 

&gt;  You want to change this primal instinct of every alive organism and equalize homosexual relations with it? 

You see, that's exactly the point. Anyone with a sexual orientation different than heterosexuality does not somehow ignore their ""primal instinct."" They are born with that particular sexual orientation; it's who they are. Essentially is not much different from one person liking the colour yellow while another prefers blue. 

Furthermore, you do know that homosexuality occurs in most animal species as well, right? So much for your argument, which wasn't valid to begin with because it rests on a naturalistic fallacy.

If the producers in Australia, Argentina and elsewhere figure that the tariffs, the costs for transportation, and the regulatory barriers are too high, they won't sell and ship anything to the UK. 

How do you solve that? You negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement that goes far beyond mere tariffs. Take about five to ten years to complete.

1476,"Ever since the socialist party took over with Jos√© S√≥crates at the helm (who would eventually be arrested for corruption) the country has seen terrible public spending and heavy taxing over both the private citizen and companies. Now, the same socialist party currently ruling did not actually win general elections, but invoked a special motion that overthrew the most voted party (social democrats, the ones who had to turn S√≥crates' shit sandwich and take the country out of economic ruin, at a great sacrifice from the Portuguese people, but to an eventual success) and a coalition between the socialist party, the communist party and the leftist party was formed and is the current government. Apart from the general benefit from Europe's general growing economy, Portugal still presents alarmingly poor economic growth, no actual private initiative and [heavy taxing](https://i.ibb.co/m6zd9w4/1-E9-PIbvion-Vmk-Ia-Qmt-C4tnw.png) (when taking into account the average income of a Portuguese citizen). To make matters worse, [countless scandals regarding nepotism within the socialist party have surfaced, aunts, cousins, husbands and wives in positions of power](https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/relacoes-familiares-no-governo-de-antonio-costa-envolvem-50-pessoas-e-20-familias-427229), companies owned by family members operating in conjunction with the state, and just today it was found that the government spent 125.000 euros in anti-smoke masks to be distributed to people living in zones with a high risk of wildfires only to be discovered that the masks ordered were made of polyester which is a flammable material. It was also found out that the company that was sourced by the state to produce these masks is owned by the husband of a member of the socialist party. That's just today.

To make matters worse, the socialist party has basically no opposition. Their biggest rivals, the social democrats imploded and have now a weak leader. One of the major figures of the social democrats left the party and started his own. CDS, the People's Party has a very weak leader. 

Somehow, people are still voting on the socialist party, partly because some are poorly educated and have benefited from Europe's slight economic boost and have a few extra ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ in the bank and feel like that is a direct return from the country's government (and god knows they try to sell at as that). Meanwhile, a few new small parties have been formed and are trying to affirm themselves in the political spectrum. The most relevant ones are LIVRE (Free party, eco-socialists) and Iniciativa Liberal (Liberal Initiative, liberal party), though these will have to wait until the next general elections to see some sort of chance to actually be relevant. As it stands, the country is expected to be surpassed by Romania by 2024. MSc level engineers from our best schools can expect their first salary to be around 1000‚Ç¨ net. MSc level engineers from the best courses from the best schools in the country, such as an aerospace engineer from IST, can expect their first salary to maybe reach 1200‚Ç¨ net and a very small margin of progress because it is very expensive for companies to increase their employees' salaries in Portugal, you can see that in the first graph I linked where the blue portion is the net salary and the red portion is tax, so, for an employee to receive 2000‚Ç¨ net, a company needs to spend more than 4000‚Ç¨ with that worker. This may work in countries with strong, successful companies and high wages like Scandinavia, but it leads to an impoverished population in a country where the minimum wage is still 700‚Ç¨. Then there's the cost of living myth. Yes, services are cheaper in Portugal, national made items in the supermarket are marginally cheaper, but that's masked by what actually hurts the wallet. High-value items like electronics, smartphones, TVs tend to be more expensive (which is why Amazon UK is so used here) and as if that was not enough, Portugal has the most expensive cars in Europe *and* the most expensive gas, in a country with miserable salaries. Taxing in the automobile sector is up the wazoo. Remember Luxembourg? Just as a quick comparison: an expensive car such as an Audi Q7 starts from 88k‚Ç¨ in Portugal. In Luxembourg, it starts from 59k‚Ç¨. Have in mind that Luxembourgers earn orders of magnitude better than the Portuguese. This is why a large portion of students that come out of the best universities are fleeing the country like no tomorrow. An aerospace engineer in Luxembourg, with a bit of luck, can actually expect 100k‚Ç¨ annually as the first salary, as opposed to 20k in their native country.

1513,"&gt;Use *imperial* measurements

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(unit)

&gt; The slug is a derived unit of mass in the weight-based system of measures, most notably within the British Imperial measurement system and in the United States customary measures system. Systems of measure either define mass and derive force or define a base force and derive a mass unit.[1] A slug is defined as the mass that is accelerated by 1 ft/s2 when a force of one pound (lbf) is exerted on it. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushel

&gt; A bushel (abbreviation: bsh. or bu.) is an imperial and US customary unit of volume based upon an earlier measure of dry capacity. The old bushel was equal to 2 kennings (obsolete), 4 pecks or 8 dry gallons and was used mostly for agricultural products such as wheat. In modern usage, the volume is nominal, with bushels denoting a mass defined differently for each commodity. 

-

&gt; Some of the more common ones are:
&gt;
&gt; Oats:
&gt;
&gt; US: 32 lb[4] (14.5150 kg)
&gt;
&gt; Canada: 34 lb[5] (15.4221 kg)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(unit)

&gt; The minim (abbreviated min, ‚ôèÔ∏é or ‚ôçÔ∏é) is a unit of volume in both the imperial and US customary systems of measurement. Specifically it is ‚Äã1‚ÅÑ60 of a fluidram[1] or ‚Äã1‚ÅÑ480 of a fluid ounce.[2][3] In the Pharmacopoeia, it is also noted that the minim was originally created by Mr Timothy Lane, F.R.S., as 61440 parts per wine gallon. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredweight

&gt; The hundredweight (abbreviation: cwt), formerly also known as the centum weight or quintal, is an English, imperial, and US customary unit of weight or mass of various values. Its value differs between the American and imperial systems. The two values are distinguished in American English as the ""short"" and ""long"" hundredweight and in British English as the ""cental"" and the ""imperial hundredweight"".
&gt;
&gt; The short hundredweight or cental of 100 pounds (45.359237 kg) is used in the US.[1]
&gt;
&gt; The long or imperial hundredweight of 8 stone or 112 pounds (50.802345 kg) is in informal use in the imperial system[2] but its use for trade in the UK was ended by Schedule 1, Part VI of the Weights and Measures Act 1985.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoppus

&gt; The hoppus cubic foot (or ‚Äòhoppus cube‚Äô or ‚Äòh cu ft‚Äô) was the standard volume measurement used for timber in the British Empire and countries in the British sphere of influence before the introduction of metric units. It is still used in the hardwood trade of some countries. This volume measurement was developed to estimate what volume of a round log would be usable timber after processing, in effect attempting to ‚Äòsquare‚Äô the log and allow for waste. The hoppus ton (HT) was also a traditionally used unit of volume in British forestry. One hoppus ton is equal to 50 hoppus feet or 1.8027 cubic metres. Some shipments of tropical hardwoods, especially shipments of teak from Myanmar (Burma), are still stated in hoppus tons.[1] 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)

&gt;The chain is a unit of length equal to 66 feet (22 yards). It is subdivided into 100 links[1][2] or 4 rods. There are 10 chains in a furlong, and 80 chains in one statute mile.[2] In metric terms, it is 20.1168 m long.[2] By extension, chainage (running distance) is the distance along a curved or straight survey line from a fixed commencing point, as given by an odometer.
&gt;
&gt;The chain has been used for several centuries in England and in some other countries influenced by English practice. In the United Kingdom, there were 80 chains to the mile, but until the early nineteenth century the Scottish and Irish customary miles were longer than the statute mile; consequently a Scots chain was about 74 (imperial) feet,[3] an Irish chain 84 feet. These longer chains became obsolete following the adoption of the imperial system in 1824.[4] This unit ceased to be permitted to be ""used for trade"" in 1985. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogshead

&gt; A hogshead (abbreviated ""Hhd"", plural ""Hhds"") is a large cask of liquid (or, less often, of a food commodity). More specifically, it refers to a specified volume, measured in either imperial or US customary measures, primarily applied to alcoholic beverages, such as wine, ale, or cider.

The Withdrawal Act 2018 says we must leave deal or no deal - and the date got amended to 31st Oct 2019. This is the law.

The indicative vote earlier in the year saying parliament did not want no deal was non-binding. It did not reverse the Withdrawal Act 2018 (which received Royal Assent and is the law of the land).

There is no majority in parliament to repeal that Act and there is no majority to revoke.

1565,"Yeah, he's chatting rubbish. Brexit was about the pound. After Greek crisis, europe had to merge the banking system, so there would now be a euro table where Britain can't participate cus it's not in the euro. In that euro table there would be all sorts of discussions and maybe rules and regulations affecting banking, perhaps even British banking, where UK wouldn't have a say because it wasn't part of the euro table.

Cameron tried to get some sort of accommodation, opt outs presumably from financial rules, but he wasn't able to get anything, hence the referendum, and hence the results.

Rhetorically, and on the surface, Farage did all that... you know, and there was also that whole crisis background, but fundamentally the very educated British people came up with the verdict they did based on that pound question.

Realistically, Britain can't really be part of EU unless it is part of the euro. So all the rest is just bluster. The man who broke the bank of england wrote all this in the 90s. 

Hence why it might seem a bit surprising this Boris statement. The British people are not racist. Trump is just too dumb to know why Americans voted the way they did, but that's because Trump speaks behind glass - a coward who can't even speak directly to his own people.

1634,"&gt;Unpaid labor is still labor and it‚Äôs stressful as hell.

No. It's not.  ""Any job that you can do in your pajamas, is not a difficult job.""  It's obviously not as stressful as working.  Otherwise women wouldn't be living so long.

The industrial revolution produced machines which reduced housework down to 2 or 3 hours a day, and women today barely have 2 children (instead of 4-7 preindustrially.)  This is why they are overwhelmingly more likely to work part time.  Women refuse to take ""unpleasant"" work, regardless of what it pays.  They work fewer hours, take more sick leave, and refuse to commute long distances.  All of which result in them being paid less, having lower stress, and living longer.

&gt;But the current lifespan gap is at least partially explained by the fact men ‚Äòchoose‚Äô more dangerous jobs

Death by all causes are insignificant compared to smoking and heart disease.  I believe I explained this already.

&gt;Sure, the more feminist countries like Sweden have men and women share paid and unpaid labor, and women can partake those dangerous jobs too.

LOL except they don't.  They do just the opposite.  The most gender egalitarian countries have the LARGEST occupational gender segregation and the LARGEST differences in personalities between men and women.

I hope I do understand what you're saying the way you want me to. No, it's not true, I Hope I'm wrong and you don't mean what I think you mean. I hope we will come to an understanding sooner or later. 

First thing first :
&gt; I of course will not respect your belief

&gt; I hope one day you will see

I won't lie, some part of me would like to say the same to you and stop the conversation here. 

But please understand that is exactly what fanatic religious people, for one example, thinks when they see someone behave in what they think are wrong. (being gay for exemple). 

We can agree to the fact that we disagree. But if you have an once of morality you should also respect what I do believe. Because when something cannot be proven it is a belief and nobody is right or wrong and every opinion should be respected. 

I know you're probably boiling because you can't make me understand how it is wrong to cause suffering to animals. 
Please do understand fanatic religious people think the same for gay people. I does not mean they are right. If you can't ""prove"" that it is wrong, it's because it is a belief. And no matter how hard you believe it, it doesn't make it true (or false).

&gt; I never tried to imagine what being a goose was like

Maybe I got carried reading other comments here, usually the though process goes like this. *Imagine what the animal feels* -&gt; ""This animal is suffering"" -&gt; ""I would not like to suffer"" -&gt; ""this is bad"". 

This though process can only be obtained if you identify yourself to the animal. Did you have another though process to come to the conclusion that eating meat cause suffering to animals ? 

&gt; what an insane statement that because it knows nothing else it must not suffer.

&gt; Did children born into slavery have good lives, incapable of suffering, just because they never knew anything better?

Suffering is two things. Physical suffering. As fire burn and lack of food make you starve. We're of course not talking of this here. And psychological. 

The first statement is very true and provable. It's not insane at all. Would you think you would be happy living the life of a farmer in medieval times ? Or a factory worker during the industrial revolution, which was way better ? Because to today standards it would be considered mistreatment of employee and so very wrong. 

But do you think people at that time were all suffering ? Of course not, what could be better than what they had ? Nothing ! 

Now to your ""argument"" ... What about slaves ? 
Well ask a slave what could be better than being a slave. Not being a slave maybe ? Like the people using them ? The people they see every day being free and with no need to do dirty work since they had slaves ? They do know better. 

Now I do not believe, and it is a belief as I don't think scientific papers exist on the matter, that a goose cannot wish for a human life or comprehend the fact that they are being used or the concept of liberty when they lived all their lives in a cage. I do not believe gooses have a human like curiosity to wonder what's beyond the cage. 

Now some quick responses. 

a) Can be true, can be false, the statement is way too generic and does not mean anything outside a clear context. 

b) First prove me the ""life of suffering part"" we will talk about the rest after

c) How do you know it is stressful for them? Like without trying to imagine what a goose feels ? Since you don't do that. You're saying this like it's a rule of the universe. Well it's not and needs evidence. It is as much common sense as it is to say ""a horse is stressed when we ride him because it's not natural for them"". If it is not, please explain why.

d) Out of context I had a paragraph explaining why empathy towards humans is necessary for life in society. Nobody in the society is hurt by the fact that an animal is. Hence there is no ""need"" for empathy toward animals. 
Now I now it's not about ""need"" for you this is 3 steps too far for the rest of the discussion and would suggest keeping this for when we will agree on other points.

&gt; Basically you are on one hand pretending there is no moral value to the life of a goose, then clearly implying there is by suggesting they would naturally do the same thing given the choice

No. I'm saying there is no useful moral value to the life of a goose.
But I know we can't agree on that unless I could speak with you for hours and hours, which we won't. 

So i'm also saying, that **even if there was**, we can't prove the alleged ""suffering of goose"", hence it is a belief that goose are suffering and we should not make decisions for other (a ban). Because of a belief.  

&gt; This is just cognitive dissonance.

cognitive dissonance is not when someone contradict himself by being moronic (which I wasn't, you misinterpreted what I was saying). 
in truth cognitive dissonance is what I hope to achieve talking to you haha. 

Wiki : cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who holds two or more contradictory beliefs. 

You believe in something -&gt; I make an argument you agree with disproving said thing -&gt; Your core belief is that it's true, but now you also believe it's not -&gt; Your brain does not know how to compute the fact that it is true but also false -&gt; Cognitive dissonance. 

It's kinda the only way to change a core belief of someone. Which is really hard and time consuming and frustrating. Because it is a belief at the end of the day and belief and arguments/fact don't go very well together for a lot of people.

&gt;I hope you will one day get the perspective to recognize this is cruel and unacceptable. 

At least that's respectful. 
Maybe someday we will prove that animals born in cage live a life of pain and suffering agony. Your belief will become a fact and mine will disappear. However with the current informations. I think we will prove the contrary. 

Now in either case what define if it is unacceptable or not is neither for you or me as individual to decide but as a society. And I do hope we will live in a society were we will understand the total lack of reason to give a second though about that. And not in a society were we don't need reasons to do things because we could do a lot of shit with no reason to.",,/r/europe/comments/chzdzw/ban_barbaric_french_foie_gras_danish_politicians/ev22151/,RainbowUnicat,1564169090

1681,"
Boris Johnson‚Äôs new government said on Friday there would be no new Brexit talks until the EU dropped its insistence on the Irish backstop, setting the UK on a collision course with Brussels.  

The new UK prime minister has said the withdrawal agreement struck between the EU and his predecessor, Theresa May, cannot win the support of parliament.  

Mr Johnson‚Äôs spokesman said on Friday that the prime minister would be ‚Äúenergetic‚Äù in seeking a deal with the EU but added: ‚ÄúThe withdrawal agreement has been rejected three times by the House of Commons. It‚Äôs not going to pass. So that means reopening the withdrawal agreement and securing the abolition of the backstop.‚Äù  

The comments came as the Irish government warned that the UK was ‚Äúon a collision course‚Äù with the EU over the Irish border arrangements, in a sign of growing alarm in Dublin over the uncompromising stance of Mr Johnson.  

Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, said Mr Johnson‚Äôs demand for the complete removal of the backstop arrangements from the Brexit agreement was ‚Äúvery unhelpful‚Äù and would probably result in the UK leaving the EU without a deal.  

‚ÄúI think [Mr Johnson] seems to have made a deliberate decision to set Britain on a collision course with the EU and with Ireland in relation to the Brexit negotiations. Only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that,‚Äù Mr Coveney said.  

The Irish government, backed by its EU partners, insists both that the backstop cannot be removed and that the withdrawal agreement cannot be changed ahead of October 31, when the UK is due to leave the EU.  

The backstop is designed to avoid the imposition of a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and, as the Irish see it, to remove any threat posed by Brexit to the Good Friday Agreement, which ended the conflict in the North.  

Mr Coveney was speaking in Belfast, where he met Julian Smith, the newly appointed Northern Ireland secretary, to discuss the Irish-British efforts to restore devolved government.  

Mr Coveney struck a downbeat note about the prospects of an agreed UK withdrawal from the EU three days after Mr Johnson became prime minister. ‚ÄúWe will have to wait and see whether the message coming from London changes in the weeks ahead,‚Äù he said.  

Speaking later in the day in Londonderry, Mr Smith rejected the idea the two sides were on a collision course.  

‚ÄúI think we need to find solutions, particularly for the issue of the border, but the prime minister was very clear to his cabinet yesterday that he wants to get a deal done but we do need to have structured conversations with the EU,‚Äù Mr Smith said. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre open to doing that.‚Äù   

On Thursday Michel Barnier, the EU‚Äôs chief Brexit negotiator, said Mr Johnson‚Äôs stance on the withdrawal agreement was ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù   

The EU has insisted that the UK‚Äôs new prime minister must make further efforts to pass the existing withdrawal agreement, which was hammered out over months of negotiations.  

Downing Street said there was no date scheduled for a meeting between the UK and EU to discuss the impasse.

1720,"The actual offer that the UK has on the table is ""GFA ends, we keep Northern Ireland, we do trade with the EU"".

The UK isn't going to *say* that, whether for political or legal reasons.

Instead, both the EU and UK have been disingenuously claiming (the UK that one of various administrative or technical mechanisms will somehow work, the EU that an Irish Sea border is acceptable) that everything is fine.

IMHO, the best way to do this would be the RoI to recognize that she's got no lever likely to result in her getting Northern Ireland and formally terminating the GFA with the UK, the UK and the EU to be honest with the public about viable outcomes, and a UK-EU trade agreement to go through.  The Republic of Ireland winds up as part of a big EU country down the line, sees a ton of immigration elsewhere from the EU, and winds up well-to-do and populated mostly by people that don't give a damn about sticking the Brits in the eye over some past ethnonationalist fight.  The Brits wind up not in the EU but trading with it and closely-associated with it.

The lame way to do this, which is what happens if the RoI says ""fuck off, I'm not cutting any deals"", is that the UK says ""okay, your call"", and doesn't set up a border on goods entering NI from the RoI.  Brussels makes the RoI impose a border at the border on goods entering the RoI, because enforcing borders at the outside of a customs union is essential for a customs union to work.  The RoI does so, because she values EU membership over leaving the EU and trying to solo lever NI out of the UK.  The UK says ""the GFA says no border, and if you don't get rid of this illegitimate border, the GFA is void under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 60"".  A bit after that, the UK announces that the GFA is now void.  Lots of ill will is generated, the same outcome on Northern Ireland happens as in the above route, and the UK, Republic of Ireland, Netherlands, and a few other countries get hammered on trade for a while.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ci3da8/ireland_says_uks_johnson_very_unhelpful_on_brexit/ev1mkrm/,vokegaf,1564161411

1789,"&gt; now there‚Äôs talks

PESCO is opt-in. Ireland made doubly sure that military stuff requires unanimity.

Honestly, I think half of the UK‚Äôs problem with the EU is that it didn‚Äôt get its priorities straight BEFORE signing up to treaties like Lisbon. THAT was the ideal time to dig your heels in and make demands, and you didn‚Äôt. The fact that the UK government didn‚Äôt give you a referendum at that time is not the EU‚Äôs fault. Don‚Äôt call the EU undemocratic because of that; it‚Äôs your government that was undemocratic in that case.

Honestly, to me it seems like the UK has priorities that are incompatible with being part of a team. And that‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs your prerogative and I support it. We‚Äôre all in this union voluntarily and (to work a little good-humoured ribbing in) that‚Äôs why Ireland likes it: because the last Union we were in wasn‚Äôt voluntary and didn‚Äôt let us leave without an entire war. We definitely UNDERSTAND the desire to be free, but the difference is that in Ireland‚Äôs opinion, in the EU we already are free. Yes, every once in a while France and Germany get notions, and try to do things mainly to their own benefit, but if you‚Äôre good at politicking you can outvote them. So yes, Ireland is annoyed by Brexit because it leaves us in an awkward position in terms of the border, and we genuinely think it‚Äôs a bad idea anyway and you‚Äôre shooting yourselves in the foot... but if you want to leave, that‚Äôs your prerogative. And sure, we‚Äôll talk gleefully online about how Northern Irish dissatisfaction with how the UK seems unconcerned about Northern Irish problems opens the door to Irish reunification... but we‚Äôre Irish; you knew we look forward to reunification happening someday. We just didn‚Äôt expect you to help us.

So no hard feelings, and don‚Äôt let Reddit colour your view of how we view you.

1797,"I'll play along, bullet by bullet, however silly they mostly are.

1)casually is not the word. Of course you should avoid killing things if reasonably possible. Who the fuck casually kills things in grass. You mean accidentally, which is the end of that argument.
2)trees and plants don't have the sentience and capacity for suffering at the level of animals. And if they did, veganism would still be the answer, because humans eating plants means 10 times fewer plants need to be eaten than humans eating animals.
3)same as answer 2.
4)accidentally again. what exactly is your point here?  
5)I don't want that to happen either. This is a bad thing that should also be avoided as far as possible.

Basically you've tried to give some generic arguments along the lines of ""plants have feelings"" - which is dumb and trivially rebuked, then thrown in some arguments about how it is impossible to live a perfectly death-free life. Which is fine and true, except we aren't having that argument. I never claimed otherwise. I aim to minimize unnecessary suffering. So why you think telling me I cant eliminate it all is beyond me. 

To your first question: It is better that fewer animals suffer, so lets stop contributing to it. The animals we torture and kill would not exist otherwise, so it is not an either/or situation as you pretend.
If you mean nature is cruel, so we should be too - then you are a maniac. We have laws and civilization to avoid the barbarism of nature, and should act in a better way, as we are both capable and have no need to act barbarically to survive.

To your second:Of course it is, if the knowledge allows you to avoid the suffering. Stop funding and causing suffering, and the amount will decrease. This is good.

To your third:It isn't, it is the amount of suffering that matters. The problem is in measuring that in dissimilar species. If you honestly believed that the answer to your question here is ""it isn't"", then you had better go vegan. As it happens, I never claimed that, you seem to be arguing with yourself, and I suspect you are just trying to sneak back the ""plants have feelings too"" argument, which I've already dealt with.

This is really basic stuff. If you genuinely wanted to discuss, debate or learn, you could have answered all of these questions with a 30 second google. They aren't even the trickier aspects of the morality of eating animals.

Now I do believe that empathy between humans is an evolutional trait that helped humans to survive and thrive in communities and is necessary to live in society today.

Meaning if someone has a total lack of empathy and doesn't understand why it's bad to kill other people he is a threat to society and there should be rules to ensure he does not kill people.

But nobody is hurt by overfeeding goose. Only offended. And i'd like to live in a society were being ofended does not grant you the right to censure or restrict the freedom of someone.

On an another note, goose do migrate and have to stock fat before the trip. Meaning they will eat 5 times their daily need before doing so. 

So when you imagine yourself being fed 5 times your daily needs. You do not imagine what a goose would feel.

Wear light colors that reflect.

Wear a hat.

Wear sunglasses, this has a surprising placebo effect when the glare if there sun is motivated and uv damage to your eyes is no joke.

Drink lots of water. Take in twice what you *think* you need.

Don't push it. If it feels like too much then stop. Heat related injuries catch people by surprise and can be deadly.

Don't leave kids or animals in your car, they will die.

Don't leave *things* in your car, it's going to melt and make a mess.

Plan going out at the cooler parts of the day. For us we get up early on weekends and get all our errands done before the day gets to it's hottest.

* displacing animals and destroying their habitats for crop fields
* killing animals that accidentally find themselves in the path of the harvester
* killing animals that come to eat the crop

The reason is that the models fail to derive the influences of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature. A too small natural component results in a too large portion for the contribution of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. That is why 6 J. KAUPPINEN AND P. MALMI IPCC represents the climate sensitivity more than one order of magnitude larger than our sensitivity 0.24¬∞C. Because the anthropogenic portion in the increased CO2 is less than 10 %, we have practically no anthropogenic climate change. The low clouds control mainly the global temperature.

And Japan: ""This study provides an opportunity to rethink the impact of clouds on climate. When galactic cosmic rays increase, so do low clouds, and when cosmic rays decrease clouds do as well, so climate warming may be caused by an opposite-umbrella effect.

There are even interviews that Germany looked for ways to break up Yugoslavia to get their export goods into the south, but I have no concrete written proof except hearsay from few diplomats on youtube.

2171,"&gt;I am saying that leading up to Brexit the UK government could have done a lot more to handle immigration

The rules on non-EU migration were brought in in the year 2010. Most of the non-EU people in the statistics are *students* - and they pay their fees up front in cash. They don't take out loans like the EU lot and then abscond without paying.

All the stats indicate that the non-EU migrants are of a much higher quality than the EU migrants.

Going forward, we're just going to bring the rules for EU migrants in line with those for non-EU migrants. If you are earning more than ¬£30,000 you can come in, if you are earning less than that, you need to go to some other EU country (if the EU is as wonderful as they claim, these low-skilled people will be welcomed elsewhere).

As for slavery - we abolished it in England as long ago as 1774 (Somerset case). It's an absolute travesty that the EU has brought slavery back and we have slave traders and slaves entering our country because of the EU's shit ""values"" of free movement of slaves. We're incandescent with rage over it.

Enough! We're ending this and no amount of europeans telling us that slavery helps the economy will change our minds.

This leads to regions having a higher drunk consumption and also higher amount of drug deaths. In a country with ~5 million people (like a mega city) a high rate is alarming but you can still break it down to factors.

The US are not just 5 millions. They are 327 millions. There will be communities or states with lower death rate inside. And there will be communities with a much higher rate of death.

That would be plain wrong, since the access to the EU single market benefit Finland's economy way more than the membership fees can offset.

2298,"&gt; What about the side effects of puberty blockers? Are those permanent? How hard is it to unblock puberty later on? How long can puberty be safely blocked for?

Normal puberty will start shortly after quitting puberty blockers. There are a few possible side effects (sometimes some bone density loss), with a possibility of infertility which is why doctors are VERY careful with prescribing them. Being allowed to take them takes atleast a year of diagnostic evaluations by an entire team, including requiring the child to live as the opposite gender before their body has changed.

&gt; Also you do realize that the majority of children feeling some sort of gender dysphoria before puberty almost always have those feels naturally resolve themselves by the end of puberty right?

Which is why the majority of children with some gender dysphoria are NOT prescribed puberty blockers. Doctors really are very strict and thorough in this. Which bring me to the next point:

&gt; That's a massive if.

Doctors are so thorough that we have difficulty researching adults who regretted taking puberty blockers as a minor... because they're incredibly rare. In some studies, not a single one, with percentages usually ranging between 0.3% and 3.4%. Which means that the amount of transgender adults regretting they didn't take puberty blockers as kids, is larger than the adults that do regret they did.",,/r/europe/comments/chlkvj/puberty_is_not_a_disease_italian_council_moves_to/euzuonf/,tiisje,1564126721

I don't give a shit about *your* penis in particular, but I do give a shit about the human right to bodily autonomy.

&gt;so I find it funny how uncircumcised men are telling me I can't enjoy sex when I have already have fulfilling sexual life.

I'm not saying you can't enjoy sex at all.  I'm just saying you cant enjoy it as much as an intact guy can.  The fact is, you can't feel with what you don't have, and you lack a whole bunch of highly erogenous nerves that intact guys don't.  I'm not scorning you for this, I'm offering you my condolences.

Then girls should get their clitoral hoods off for the same reasons.  Or, you know, we can all just fucking *wash* - it's not difficult, you know.

Offshore, you just make a floating turbine, drag it out there and spend an afternoon putting down suction anchors and call it a day. Use one of those giant cable ships to drag out some cables and tada. And since you could build a turbine that's 3x as big as anything onshore the economics and capacity factor crush onshore.

And cars in the table are shown fully occupied as the only mode of transport - and with an amazing 0.042 when later in the text they're given as 0.44 per car (which would be 0.11 fully occupied).

2628,"&gt; Hinkley Point C's costs of ¬£92.50 per megawatt hour.

Hinkley Point C is using first generation of EPR reactor with design issues that increased planned cost. EDF is redesigning it to fix those issues and to decrease cost to make it competitive on international market. APR-1400 and VVER-1200 are much cheaper and proven reactors.

Lazard's numbers are incorrect, especially for Europe: 

* It's using only 40 years lifespan of modern nuclear power plants, instead of 60.

* It's likely using overpriced AP1000 reactors that are not competitive on international market and probably even First of a kind cost. They use capital cost range: $6,500 - $12,250 per kWp
Even overpriced Hinkley Point C is much closer to their low estimate of capital cost with ~$7755/kWp.

* It's using Solar and wind numbers only in best USA locations, like Southwest USA solar irradiation numbers, which is not applicable in in other countries and even within most of the USA. Even [full report, page 10](https://www.lazard.com/media/450784/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-120-vfinal.pdf) shows large variations in wind/solar electricity cost dependent on geographical locations

* It's using global average cost of debt 8% (above OECD, EU, USA), that negatively influences power sources with high initial capital cost like nuclear

[OECD report](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/nuclear-energy/the-full-costs-of-electricity-provision_9789264303119-en#page18 ) have different numbers.

Eating is just a way of using the sun's energy and the more steps in the chain between the sun and us, the more energy we waste. Plants are the most energy-efficient beings, followed by herbivores, and carnivores last. That's why, by biomass, plants are more numerous than prey animals which are more numerous than predators.

Rather than spending resources to produce pasture to feed cows, it's better to take those resources to produce vegetables and feed humans directly. This is a thermodynamics fact; the fact the laws of physics are inconvenient isn't propaganda.

That being said, this concerns mostly beef. Chicken and pork, while also not as efficient as vegetables, tend to be relatively ok for the environment.

Scots dancing in the streets waving Saltires celebrating independence = inspirational example for Catalans to follow.

Scots standing despondent in dole queues as the Scottish government sinks under a debt mountain = terrible warning that dampens Catalan ardour for independence.

You persist in looking for a legal/political parallel without recognising it's the emotional parallels that matter. If Scotland makes a success of independence it will encourage Catalans to think they could do the same, if things turn out badly it will discourage them.

When I was in 4 year of primary school boys would show us cartoon porn they found online.

Parents generally try to avoid explaining sex to kids. Sex education is mostly done by older friends and the internet, that's why schools should step up. Parents have a huge influence on their kids and if they wish they can still add emotional context to the basic education kids receive at school.

They site this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;However, use of this intervention has only recently begun, so no other  follow-up studies are available and many questions are still unanswered.  Thus, many professionals remain critical about the puberty-blocking  treatment (e.g.[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0375), [41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0455), [42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0460)). The primary counterarguments are as follows:

1. &amp;#x200B;

&gt;At Tanner stage 2 or 3, the individual is not sufficiently mature or authentically free to take such a decision.[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0375), [41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0455)  
&gt;  
&gt;2.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is not possible to make a certain diagnosis of GD in adolescence, because in this phase, [gender identity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gender-identity) is still fluctuating.[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0375), [41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0455), [42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0460)  
&gt;  
&gt;3.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moreover,  puberty suppression may inhibit a ‚Äòspontaneous formation of a  consistent gender identity, which sometimes develops through the ‚Äúcrisis  of gender‚Äù‚Äô (p. 375).[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0465)  
&gt;  
&gt;4.  
&gt;  
&gt;Considering the high percentage of desisters, early [somatic treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/somatic-treatment) may be premature and inappropriate.[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0375)  
&gt;  
&gt;5.  
&gt;  
&gt;Research  about the effects of early interventions on the development of bone  mass and growth ‚Äì typical events of hormonal puberty ‚Äì and on [brain development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/brain-development) is still limited,[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0285) so we cannot know the long-term effects on a large number of cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;6.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although  current research suggests that there are no effects on social,  emotional and school functioning, ‚Äòpotential effects may be too subtle  to observe during the follow-up sessions by clinical assessment alone‚Äô  (p. 1895).[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0375)  
&gt;  
&gt;7.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  impact on sexuality has not yet been studied, but the restriction of  sexual appetite brought about by blockers may prevent the adolescent  from having age-appropriate socio-sexual experiences.[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0455)  
&gt;  
&gt;8.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  light of this fact, early interventions may interfere with the  patient's development of a free sexuality and may limit her or his  exploration of sexual orientation.[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0455), [42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0460)  
&gt;  
&gt;9.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally,  for trans girls (natal boys with a female gender identification), the  blockage of phallic growth may result in less genital tissue available  for an optimal vaginoplasty.[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444866417301101#bib0470)

2972,"&gt; This is not a risk in most circumcision cases that are done profesionally in a hospital though

This is not a requirement in the UK or the US, with bad consequences. Of course it is still a risk if it is done in a hospital, as with any kind of surgery, you can find examples of this all over the world.

You can read more about it here: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/17/male-circumcision-baby-goodluck

&gt; In 2009 alone, in one hospital in Birmingham, 105 boys were treated at A&amp;E for complications after circumcisions. One per month had life-threatening injuries.

There are some studies from the US that estimated that between 100-200 boys each year die as a result of circumcision.

This is still an unnecessary procedure in, I would guess, more than 95% of cases. There are of course circumstances where it's necessary, but no one is arguing against those. We don't go around doing surgery on children without a reason otherwise, why should we do it with circumcision?",,/r/europe/comments/cgucw0/opinion_male_circumcision_needs_to_be_seen_as/euwhhm4/,risliljan,1564075280

This study could have been conducted properly, if the population was more balanced ( say get your sample in multiple univeral medical centres spread throughout the country).  And next to that asking the question ""do you think transgenderism is contagious"" to people doesnt prove transgenderism is contagious, it just gives you their opinion. What would be more reliable is a survey where transgender patients are asked if any of their friends or people in their immediate circle came out as trans after they did, and also incooperating the possibility of people being closeted and people of the same kind seeking eachother out and therefore are likelier to have been friends to begin with.",,/r/europe/comments/chlkvj/puberty_is_not_a_disease_italian_council_moves_to/euwhopu/,leftoverfucks_given,1564075346

3148,"&gt;This is a blatant lie. Plenty of people have gone through puberty after blockers without a problem.

Im honestly curious as to how long these people were on blockers and what qualifies as ""no problems"". Shorter height, less muscle growth, smaller genitals and sperm count might not be reported as medical issues, but they hint that damage has been inflicted. Why do you think doctors inform about risk of infertility when prescribing puberty blockers?

&gt;This is misinformation, trying to pass something very rare off as the norm.

It's absolutely not rare, given how those two things are the main reasons hormones exist in the first place, and you're blocking them.

Anwyay, ive tried looking on Pubmed for clinical trials on the reversal of such hormone blockers, but i can find absolutely none. What's even more worrying is that all the claims that GnRH blockers are 'reversible' ultimately refer back to a 2008 publication by the company that makes these blockers. Look at this guideline from HRC:https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf
It constantly refers how this medication is 'reversible', but offers no citations as to whether this is true and to what extent. This is extremely dubious.",,/r/europe/comments/chlkvj/puberty_is_not_a_disease_italian_council_moves_to/euvhge0/,ShoeCrab,1564060652

You are right because the unit of feet has been the main unit for thousands of years, from the roman empire to literally all of Europe up until very recent times.

Asian countries had similar units that corresponding to the size of a human's foot. Why? Because it is more organic in the way you say, and much easier for a day to day use.

World GDP not emissions.  
https://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/

&gt; China and India have over 2 billion people between them and are rapidly increasing carbon consumption.

Very true. It does not really matter for the climate if people increase their spending power through local economic growth or migration. Improving the situation in countries from which people want to migrate from will also increase CO2 emissions.



&gt; Western countries have net migration levels of a few hundred thousand including those from other western countries. Of people in Western society, immigrants will tend to be much poorer and consume far less carbon than rich westerners. 

The current rates are not to high. Probably because the western countries disincentivize migration. Raising the cost of migration outside of the means of the poorest of the poor. If everyone could just spend a few hundred dollars on a flight and then stay in the west, the rates would be drastically higher. Lifting people out of utmost poverty would also increase the numbers of people able to afford migration. While it is true the average migrant would be poorer than a native and hence emit less greenhouse gasses, he would become significantly richer than before, leading to more emissions.

&gt; When looking at the numbers I'm just not sure how current levels of migration should be seen as a threat in comparison to the carbon consumption of the 300 million+ Americans, the increasing carbon consumption of 2 billion+ Indians and Chinese, and the crazy levels of consumption by corporations.

Current levels probably not. But I think the amount of people motivated to migrate will increase. Reasons include draughts, famines and weather catastrophes that will come due to climate change.

Catalonia. Spain doesn't care about Scotland, it cares about Catalonia, and if Spain believes Scotland joining the EU would encourage the Catalan independence movement, Spain will oppose Scottish membership.

It doesn't really matter what Spain says now, all that matters is the decision Spain would have to take if Scotland became independent and applied to join the EU. Anyone who says they know what that decision would be is making assumptions. We don't know when (or if) it will happen, who will be in power in Spain, or how the independence movement will develop in Catalonia. 

&gt;But that won't even be necessary because Spain isn't allowing Catalonia's independence.

Whether or not Spain will allow Catalan independence, it will not want anything that will encourage it.

I don't know how true this is, but I think any future Independence vote would follow the same process of Holyrood obtaining consent from Westminster.

The link to Spain, is that, the Spanish are also dealing with the Catalans calling for Independence from Spain. Madrid has said it would not allow an independent Catalonia to be formed. End of discussion.

The papertalk was that Spain would veto Scottish inclusion in the EU, as it would set a precedent for the EU welcoming separatists. The difference between Spain and the UK and the reason why Spain has said it would not veto, is because Scotland previously requested and received approval from Westminster, in contrast to the calls in Barcelona to simply divest itself from Spain.",,/r/europe/comments/chkcra/nicola_sturgeon_calls_for_new_scottish/euukw9q/,Tax_pe3nguin,1564046205

3449,"Letters referring to a decision to ""annihilate"" all Armenians are the authentic work of Bahaettin Shakir, one of the architects of the Armenian Genocide, according to signature analysis carried out by a leading Turkish historian, published in the *Journal of Genocide Research*.

Prof. Taner Ak√ßam of Clark University, Massachusetts, who has studied the genocide for decades, says the signatures on the two letters, dated 3 March and 7 April 1915, match those of Shakir on other documents. Prof. Ak√ßam also says he has unearthed new documents from the Ottoman Archives which show initial decisions to exterminate groups of Armenians were taken by a local branch of para-military organization Te?kilat-? Mahsusa (Special Organization) led by provincial governors in 1st December 1914.

The Armenian Genocide, the Ottoman government's systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians, was carried out during and after World War I. While present day Turkey accepts that many Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during the war, it continues to contest the 1.5 million figure and denies that the killings were systematically orchestrated and constitute a genocide. This denial - which continues despite the UN demanding in a recent Joint Allegation Letter that the Turkish government investigate the treatment of Armenians from 1915 to 1923, establish the truth and make reparations - has hinged on the patchy archival record.

The first letter studied by Prof. Ak√ßam states that the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) ""has decided to annihilate all of Armenians living within Turkey, not to allow a single one to remain, and has given the government broad authority in this regard"". The second letter reiterates this message. Previously, the letters' authenticity was questioned but, according to Prof. Ak√ßam, signature comparison indicates they were authored by Shakir who, as head of the para-military Special Organization, helped to plan and carry out the genocide.

""These letters indicate there was an actual, conscious decision taken to annihilate the empire's Armenian population and that it was taken before 3 March 1915,"" says Prof. Ak√ßam. ""Moreover, there were other related decisions which preceded this final one, as a series of documents we discovered in the Ottoman Archives shows.""

These documents suggest that initial decisions to eliminate groups of Armenians were not taken by the Central Committee of the CUP and/or by central government, but by governors in the provinces of Van and Bitlis.

""In their communications - both with Istanbul and with one another - the governors did not see the need to use vague language or euphemisms in referring to the annihilation of the Armenians, but spoke of it openly, even offering a number of tangible ideas regarding how such an extermination could or should be carried out,"" says Prof. Ak√ßam.

Policy decisions regarding the elimination of Armenians, while initially made at the regional level, would eventually serve to pressure the central government in Istanbul to adopt a more radical overall policy, he concludes.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/chkh75/historian_unearths_solid_evidence_for_the/euu8ekr/,nibaneze,1564039565

3497,"&gt; Obviously it's banned because it usually involves much worse than partial removal of the clitoral hood. They're not going to say, ""we frown on all other forms of brutality except this one instance"". FGM has historically been about submission and control of women, and it's usually in ass backwards countries where women are property like cattle. It's harder for the civilized world to accept that Jews and American doctors are in the wrong, especially when so many circumcised men don't mind or even want to perpetuate the trend with their own male offspring. I don't think it's hard to understand why they're treated differently--it's a lot easier to judge others than to judge faults in your own society.

**Usually** is the keyword here. We don‚Äôt allow circumcision where the whole penis head is cut off either, so once again, mutilation is used for all forms of FGM by definition, even the one that is literally the same as male circumcision. So obviously society already uses the word mutilation for that type of unnecessary procedure. Your semantics analysis is pointless after that fact. 

&gt; I don't think FGM should be undermined in order to promote ending male circumcision

Why? Nobody is talking about making FGM legal. Why is it such an issue for you to use existing common understand that cutting babies up is wrong, that you refuse to acknowledge obvious equivalencies? Again, simple circumcision doesn‚Äôt, according to you, meet the criteria for mutilation, and yet it still does for the female variant. So, the wrap it up, either accept that the word is used for male circumcision, or I expect you to be exactly as annoyed by the inclusion of female circumcision under the term FGM.

That continues to be a **false equivalence**.  

Circumcision of the foreskin is a valid medical procedure.  
Female Genital Mutilation is *not* a valid medical procedure.

Do you *understand* that a valid medical procedure being performed unnecessarily is harmful, but still not equivalent to mutilation with no medical purpose whatsoever?  
Or are you so wholly committed to 'the cause' that you will lie your ass off if you think it might score a political point or emotionally shunt people towards your side?

Stop fucking lying.

Real fucking simple: don't fucking lie, don't bullshit, don't misrepresent shit.  
It makes you look tremendously ignorant and/or duplicitous.

Again: there are valid **medical purposes** for circumcision of the foreskin.

Your staunch refusal to acknowledge, accept, and incorporate this is to your own detriment.

Thenclitoral hood is the homologous tissue to the foreskin, and the nerve bundle in the male frenulum is more highly innervated than the external clitoris. 

&gt;	Girls up to 15 years old will experience it, they'll be held down by several people while they take the most rudimentary tools to lop off as much as they can, without any form of anesthesia, leaving girls with blood pouring down their legs to wait in dirty pits for someone to collect them. 

That‚Äôs how it is done to boys in Africa too, by every group that also cuts girls, except where westerners are doing it for them by less dangerous methods. Would FGM be OK if they did it at the same age as their brothers, with the same anaesthetics and so on, and it were done by doctors in clinics as good as are used for anything else, as in Malaysia or Singapore, or Indonesia for those with money?

3824,"&gt; Or given by NATO states, or did I just imagine ""Danke Deutchland"" being a thing. Besides, you think that's how your army built itself up so much for Op. Storm. 

If you insist in perpetuating this, please provide some proof. Which NATO member provided what weapons, when, and in what quantity? ""Danke Deutschland"" was a thing because Germany (and to a lesser extent, Austria) strongly supported Croatia diplomatically and had our back in the EC/EU and the UN. Their support was very open and very public, at a time when there wasn't much of that going around, so of course it engedered massive gratitude among the population. 

And yes, our army did build itself up heavily between 1991 and 1995, by itself, or rather, by the state purchasing massive amounts of weaponry from the black market. The government, being pretty desperate as it was in 1990 and 1991, used up Croatia's entire pension fund in order to arm it's fledgling army - the pension fund was one of the few cashes of money under the control of individual republics in Yugoslavia. And anway, the large amounts of money flowing through the hands of black market arms dealers resulted in a huge amount of corruption, and laid the groundwork for the creation of an entire subclass of the political establishment that laundered money and stole from the state for the next decade or so. 

So yeah, we built up our army ourselves, at least where weapons are concerened, at massive cost in both money and the introduction of systematic corruption. 

 

&gt;Yes, which aided your army a fair bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the biggest impact anything from them had on you was getting your recognition. Without that you would've been toast regardless of all else, that's the key point here.

  
Well, ""the West"", or rather the primary NATO member countries, only supported and acknowledged our independence after the Yugoslav National Army's fiasco at Vukovar and the ensuing massacre of the Croatian prisoners and civillians. After that event, two things happened; not supporting Croatia became morally reprehensible in the eyes of their populations and thus potentially led to losing votes at home, and the survival of some sort of independent Croatia became practically guaranteed due to the heavy material losses suffered by the JNA's first rank units, which made the planned subsequent push towards Zagreb impossible to execute. 

Before that, during the war's first period, the West (in particular the EC/EU) strongly supported the survival of Yugoslavia, and delayed and complicated Croatia and Slovenia's road to international recognition. The arms embargo imposed on the whole of Yugoslavia was geared to fulfill that exact purpose - it didn't impact the still-somewhat-functioning federal government and it's army because it controlled huge stockpiles, while it made raising any kind of army massively difficult for Croatia and Slovenia. The West hoped to integrate Yugoslavia into European and trans-atlantic institutions as one whole piece - it didn't want to have to deal with the mess that would have (and in reality did) result from Yugoslavia's dissolution. 

And yeah, as I said, US training did help a huge deal, you're right there.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/ch7a96/one_croatian_soldier_killed_two_injured_in/eusms89/,Kreol1q1q,1564010604

3826,"&gt; which eventually returned levels of sensation 

To many, this is not a benefit, but rather a downside. I'm akin to believe that sex is best when both parties enjoy it, and reduced sensation in men will obviously make it last longer. 

&gt;Others report pain from skin tightness that will always be with them.

I'd be interested in knowing if this is actually a reasonable amount of people. I've *never* heard of it, living in a country where most men are circumcised. 

&gt;Reject the evidence all you want,

I'm not rejecting anything. The only evidence provided is ""the foreskin helps maintain sensitivity and protects the penis from abrasion"" for the non circumcision argument is weak to me. As I've stated, I've no desire to be more sensitive, and I've never had or heard of anyone having issues with abrasion. This isn't rejecting evidence, this is rejecting reasoning. Those reasons are weak. Once I get past those, all I ever hear is the last bastion ""but that's *mutilation!*"", which is a final emotional appeal because the only two logical ones made weren't strong enough to sway an argument.

&gt;And I've yet to see an argument FOR circumcision able to hold up for long against even cursory rational scrutiny.

What rational scrutiny? Nobody has debated that it's *easier* to clean an uncircumcised penis, just that it's ""easy enough"". Nobody has claimed that the sensitivity is good, just that it's lost. Nobody has or can claim that my personal preference for how it looks is wrong. 

I've made this very simple: my preference stems from my desire to not have an extra thing to clean, my preference for it cosmetically, and my lack of any emotional or physical trauma from the actual surgery. 

What of those doesn't hold up to rational scrutiny? I've not seen a single attempt at claiming these are rationally wrong, just claims that the other side is better to them.


My whole point in all this was to point out that there are logical reasons why people choose either side and that neither is strictly wrong. Your side seems hell bent on saying that it's the only right choice, seemingly based on what are weak emotional appeals and subjective logical ones, no better than my own.",,/r/europe/comments/cgucw0/opinion_male_circumcision_needs_to_be_seen_as/eusmyky/,SingleInfinity,1564010684

I'm putting France ahead of the UK because they have an operational nuclear CATOBAR carrier.

Italy has a sizeable surface combattants force but uses SSKs and their carriers are more LHAs than proper STOVL carriers (although I think one of them is amphibious-oriented while the other is carrier oriented).

Spain has a decent fleet with 11 surface combattants and also operates an LHA/STOVL carrier.

Germany has a decent, although relatively small, fleet. They really need to get their shit together with maintenance though.

The Netherlands operates a relatively sizeable fleet for its size with 6 surface combattants and 4 SSKs. Their navy is under a combined command with the Belgian Navy which brings the total surface combattants number at 8. Also, they have the best long range search radar in Europe.

I didn't rank the Greek navy because, although sizeable on paper (13 surface combattants, 11 SSKs and a bunch of FACs), most of their frigates equipment is outdated and I can't speak for the current state of the submarine fleet.","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/ch9a73/uk_seeks_european_naval_force_to_counter_piracy/eusqdfo/,loicvanderwiel,1564012189

3898,"&gt;If you insist in perpetuating this, please provide some proof. Which NATO member provided what weapons, when, and in what quantity? ""Danke Deutschland"" was a thing because Germany (and to a lesser extent, Austria) strongly supported Croatia diplomatically and had our back in the EC/EU and the UN. Their support was very open and very public, at a time when there wasn't much of that going around, so of course it engedered massive gratitude among the population.

And your really believe Germany would just so stop at diplomatic support and not help further, albeit not openly? That's quite naive. I mean you did get a shitload of East German AKs and what not. Sure, a good chunk came of the black market but so did a lot from Germany. They had no more use for them.

&gt;And yes, our army did build itself up heavily between 1991 and 1995, by itself, or rather, by the state purchasing massive amounts of weaponry from the black market. The government, being pretty desperate as it was in 1990 and 1991, used up Croatia's entire pension fund in order to arm it's fledgling army - the pension fund was one of the few cashes of money under the control of individual republics in Yugoslavia. And anway, the large amounts of money flowing through the hands of black market arms dealers resulted in a huge amount of corruption, and laid the groundwork for the creation of an entire subclass of the political establishment that laundered money and stole from the state for the next decade or so.

Fair if you say so, but I still don't think you could've amassed all that with just black market weapons. As you say yourself, they were helping you by this point. Them shipping or you at least selling you weapons they don't need is not much of a stretch.

&gt;Well, ""the West"", or rather the primary NATO member countries, only supported and acknowledged our independence after the Yugoslav National Army's fiasco at Vukovar and the ensuing massacre of the Croatian prisoners and civillians. 

This would imply they gave two shits about Vukovar or your people, which I think you yourself know to not be true.

&gt;After that event, two things happened; not supporting Croatia became morally reprehensible in the eyes of their populations and thus potentially led to losing votes at home,

Only because they wanted their citizens to see it. There was no internet back then, at least not widespread, so what the news reported is what they saw. And the news reported what they were told to report. Coverage of that entire conflict was very one sided with the goal of propaganda. Someone, not sure where I saw it, put it quite well, and that was that if we were friendly to the West, all those poor innocent Albanians and Bosnian Muslims killed would've become terrorist Islamists armed to the teeth. The West was on your side and use propaganda to it's advantage. Going by that prior example, if they were actually backing us you would've just been resurgent Usta≈°e in need of stomping.

&gt;nd the survival of some sort of independent Croatia became practically guaranteed due to the heavy material losses suffered by the JNA's first rank units, which made their planned subsequent push towards Zagreb impossible to execute.

Initially. But eventually the JNA would reorganize and attack again, stronger. Meanwhile, isolated, you'd stagnate. It would pretty much be the same as what happened with the RSK. Isolated it stagnated while you built yourself up, and eventually ran them over. Same thing would've happened here with the JNA eventually running you over. Didn't have to be in '92, could've been in '95, whenever.

&gt;Before that, during the war's first period, the West (in particular the EC/EU) strongly supported the survival of Yugoslavia, and delayed and complicated Croatia and Slovenia's road to international recognition. The arms embargo imposed on the whole of Yugoslavia was geared to fulfill that exact purpose - it didn't impact the still-somewhat-functioning federal government and it's army because it controlled huge stockpiles, while it made raising any kind of army massively difficult for Croatia and Slovenia.

The embargo was worthless and they themselves didn't even respect it, not in Croatia, not in Bosnia. I do agree they were initially interested in keeping it together, but this was before the war.

&gt;The West hoped to integrate Yugoslavia into European and trans-atlantic institutions as one whole piece - it didn't want to have to deal with the mess that would have (and in reality did) result from Yugoslavia's dissolution.

Indeed, before Slobo and co. decided to be dumb commies who wanted to keep the country isolated. After that they became favorable to dissolution.

The main flaw of your assumption is that it by it the West aided you out of moral reasons, which they'd never do. They had geopolitical reasons. If, as you say, they wanted to keep Yugoslavia united, they would've done so, regardless of what happened here. We could've turned literally every city into Vukovar and they wouldn't have cared. But they did care cause they supported you due to our dumb leaders.


Also, what do make of this little detail, that being that in I believe 1990, the US asked to play a football friendly against Croatia. They got their wish cause the first guy to the phone at the Yugo FA was a Croat. First time a FIFA member played against a non-member. That was a very clear sign of support for your separatism.

4031,"I agree about the aesthetics point but it *is* also sort of weird how we've just decided to preserve the building style from certain periods around Europe as if they were somehow ""special"". Of course there are historically significant buildings, very unique building styles etc. but a lot of towns and cities are basically just preserved as if they're an open air museum, and all it does is get in the way of progress, of fixing traffic issues, of fixing a housing crisis etc. 

Now obviously that doesn't mean that concrete and glass is any less shit looking but we *could* still make rules about building styles in specific parts of the towns and cities to make sure they still sort of blend in. It's not like we physically *can't* build better looking houses today after all, it's just that we allow people to build whatever shit that's the cheapest.

There are plenty of old houses around Europe that are just in horrible condition due to shitty building techniques, a complete lack of insulation, a leaky roof having caused problems over decades or even 100+ years etc. and just preserving shit for the sake for preserving it seems silly in those cases imo. There's nothing special about most of those houses after all, it's just how houses looked at a certain time. Not talking specifically about the ones in OP's post here but just old preserved houses around Europe. There's plenty that are pointless to preserve. 


Just imagine people in the future suddenly developing some ""fetish"" for the random houses we build these days for no apparent reason, and then preserving our completely standard family homes forever, preventing them from building ""greener"", safer, better, taller etc. 

It is a bit weird how we seem to want to preserve absolutely *everything* that's old in some places. Old may be prettier in a lot of cases but it also means way shittier quality, less ""green"" (they waste energy like mad), usually smaller etc. We could just make the rules that in this particular neighborhood, houses must have a certain style so they'll fit in.

In other words, it's not just about hating love. 

&gt;Your examples just weren't applicable.

They involve two consenting adults who love each other, and a society that doesn't agree that the love (and more pointedly, any attendant sexual relations) is worthy of recognition and equality, under rules which those adults claim are arbitrary and pointless. 

In other words, they're *spot-on applicable*. No analogy is perfect, but this one is as close at needs to be. You regard them as a ""disservice"" to LGBT people not because they are inapplicable, but simply because they undercut the claim that anything involving two consenting adults vs. societal norms must always be decided in favor of the former. I've never found that in and of itself a particularly impressive argument.

4054,"&gt; we simply don't know shit about the most isolated country on earth. 

Well if you don't know then don't make claims about its stability and functioning.   


&gt;Well Russia is pretty centralized and authroitarian, it's a country, not a multitude of countries like the EU or decentralized like the US.   

&gt;...
&gt;yes, when it was the Soviet Union and it was double in size (population wise), im talking about Russia itself      

Russia itself is simply a Soviet Union that has existed longer. The proper term for both is the Russian Empire which has many ethnicities and cultures under its cap. While I don't think it will dissolve if the topic is started I will bring it up. We don't known how the future will unfold. Nation-states are a relatively modern concept. If the EU remained a thing long enough the European identity will solidify and in a world with less nationalism maybe that will be considered a good enough reason to stay together as being Russian is considered now. Or maybe nationalism will strengthen in which case parts of Russia may  leave it. I think Russia has better chances but it's not immune to the same forces.   

&gt;Means other countries see Russia as a threat, if they see a threat, that means they have some power    

I don't deny Russia has some power but that it's strengthening. Being seen as a threat is not good enough. A kid with a gun would be seen as a threat while a grown fit man without a gun might not. But that doesn't mean the kid is inherently more powerful.   

&gt;Russia has always been intervening in other states.   
&gt;\-  
&gt;Hm, not really, it started with Georgia    

Ok that's complete bullshit whether you want to look at military intervention or political...   

&gt;They didn't reform it before, they are doing it now, the focus isn't on huge amounts of gear but on precision and tactics, which is a huge improvement, hence my argument that their power is growing.   

Like I said the military is a function of the economy. A small state like Croatia is never going to have a more powerful military than India even if it spends 50% of GDP. Unless Russia's increased military spending results in them securing a significant long term advantage it doesn't make Russia more powerful. And there costs to high military spending, it's  part of what did the Soviets in despite the military successes it gave them.   

&gt;Russia is still one of the largest economies in the world,   

Well the first few already account for most of the world's GDP while by the time we get to Russia's position we're talking about 1-2% of the world's economy.  

&gt;They want to shape different neighbourhoods though, China wants to take control of Asia while Russia wants to grab a hold of Europe, they can use each other to help them in that goal   

They want to do that now, but their priorities may change in the future. Historically Russia has been a  European power that China didn't want to fuck with. But now China is powerful enough to do that. China's neighbours are also growing economically and demographically  a lot more dynamically than Russia. There may come a time where Russia is manageable enough for China and not the most difficult part of the neighbourhood.   

Also while you can pair China and Russia against the US, you can't pair China and Russia against Europe. China's a fan of the EU and the two have decent relations and a huge trade volume. I don't see China helping Russia take control of Europe from which China would lose a lot economically and diplomatically.   


&gt;i don't think they are, their interests mostly pass each other, they don't have many things to divide them, but their tendencies and societies seem like good matches.   

 
Sorry but you sound quite biased to me. You don't think two very ambitious and nationalistic countries  like them  could be at odds with each other but you think Germany and France could? You agree with me that the EU and US may wane in significance but you think  Russia's rising? Pff    

&gt;they don't have many things to divide them, but their tendencies and societies seem like good matches.    

like Serbia and Croatia?  ;)  

&gt;Exactly, and as long as the US is a threat, they will work towards undermining them.   

Yeah and like I said that may not always be the case. Or if China decides it can manage the US on its own or that there's more to gain  from confronting Russia than by having its backing against the US then they have a problem.   

&gt;15 years ago a situation like Syria (where the US supports one side) would be a landslide win for the US,   

Well they could still do it IMO if their president wanted it. But Trump pulled out. Remember when Russia's mercenaries went against US soldiers in Syria they were soundly defeated.    

&gt;Yeah, and currently there are Iranian Taliban bot farms in Albania, which is wtf to me. 

Low wages, good internet, maybe it's that.   

&gt;but they aren't.   

Yes they aren't, like I said they don't want to face the backlash from that. And even though it's an achievement by Russia, it's not making it more powerful. It's making it more relevant on the world stage because it's doing something and other countries have to consider that. However it's not a sustainable kind of relevancy, it's a self-defeating one. Russia would have been more relevant in the future if it hadn't tried any elections shenanigans.    

&gt;Isn't it? Both Trump and Brexit have been huge divisive things between NATO and EU members.    

Is it wisdom to hurt yourself and your enemy? An eye for an eye but the enemy has 10 times more eyes, not to mention that you're just dragging both of you down while the rest of the world, your competitors, improve.   

There's a lot more linking the US, UK and EU then their presidents and PMs. Brexit has been a total shitshow but that has bolstered EU support across the continent. If in 10 years time the UK is under a Norway style relationship or it has rejoined the EU, Russia will have achieved nothing but make the EU more popular. Trump is doing more diplomatic damage but it's hard to quantify how much that will matter.  While Russia has soured relations between the two it has also soured its own relations with them even more.

If  Trump causes some kind of debt crisis then that would be a score for Russia.  But a US crisis will ripple to Russia and to Europe and then to Russia again, which diminishes the benefit of destabilising the US unless you're just doing it out of spite. 


&gt;Or we might see less sanctions, because over time people just accept things, just like Russia was accepted back into Council of Europe thing (pace i think it's called)    


That could happen too. But  if  it does it won't be like PACE at all. National security is a very different beast from membership in an ineffectual organisation in need of funding.

It's not a matter of biology asshole it's a matter of opinion. 

&gt; Do you believe that those upon whom circumcision has been performed for medical purposes should be labeled as 'mutilated' as you (and others) are doing?

Again I'm not doing this. I'm saying this should be the very last thing the parents should do to fix an issue. Sometimes it's the only way, sometimes it's too late but again if it's NEEDED then the parents have the right to make that decision. Look at it this way. Let's say it were possible to have a tumor when you're born so the doctors check. Doctors come back and say I have a tumor in my arm and it's malicious. Removal is an easy and necessary decision right? Ok what if I come out normal and healthy. ""Ehh remove his right arm I don't like the way it looks"".

Just trying to give an opinion from the point of view of someone who had it done at birth. So people can weigh that WITH their own opinions on the subject. 

Instead it's got to be a right and wrong thing. Fine do that then. You obviously care about it a hell of a lot more than anyone who has had it done to them.

I don't think there's a lot of locals left in Sultanahmet - but no-one cares, there's tons of other neighborhoods to live in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I myself live in Gulbahar-Mecidiyek√∂y, which actually seems somewhat heavy on foreigners, and I think its a great place. I walk to the tourist parts of town for fun when I have the time to (\~10km) the old sights are fun to walk by, and the crowds are lively and happy. (well, of the 10km walk the first 5 is more local, the second 5 is more touristy - Istiklal, Galata, Emin√∂n√º etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I go shopping in Emin√∂n√º often enough because that's still a place to get cheap shit, even as a resident.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get you guys' opinions here - Is your problem that your cities' only nice places are for tourists, and your cities don't take care of the places locals would hang out? like, are you forced to go to the same places for lack of options or something?  All of our nice hang out places are pretty full on the nicer days, but like that can't be blames solely on tourists, Be≈üikta≈ü is busy, but has relatively few tourists, Fatih stays busy and is almost all tourists (well the end of it is by city hall-grand bazaar-eminonu - Sultanahmet) of course 1km down millet cd/divanyolu and its 100% locals cause tourists have no reason to go there, but its a really nice place to hang out (capa-sehrimini)

&amp;#x200B;

Chicago when I lived there had an insane number of tourists annually (like 55 million or something, compared to its 2.5 million residents), and it never bothered me there either. locals went to the near north side, tourists went downtown, it is a big enough city we don't all have to be in the same places.

4251,"By your piss poor observations I guess no one in the US has an STI or aids at all.

Look at the numbers in a more logical way. Firstly, I don't know where you pulled 20 percent out of your ass, when the stats are 30 to 60 percent, depending on what sti or disease it is, but hey, pretend it's 20, just for shits and gigs. About 3 million people in the US get an STI every year. 20 percent less equates to 600,000 people less per year that would contract an STI.

Also know that currently, most men in the US are already circumcised, so that 3 million every year is lower than it would be without most men circumcised.

Then you can also take into account for how you have to have something in order to spread it to others, so the more population that has an STI, the higher the risk of uninfected people getting one. So that 20 percent increase would cause more than a 20 percent rise in infection rate.

In other words, you're ""barely anything"" is actually preventing an impossibly conservative 600,000 infections a year in the US alone.",,/r/europe/comments/cgucw0/opinion_male_circumcision_needs_to_be_seen_as/euqmrup/,ColeSloth,1563981579

4329,"Everyone is mocking everyone else in Poland these days, with the country being divided as ever. Mocking religion is not nice, but due to blasphemy laws and the way the government uses them religion, as in the Catholic Church, has way to much power. Remember that the 90+% of Poles are Catholic is what the church records at birth. Few go through the hard process of apostasy. But when the church gives data it seems actually 50 percent max go to mass on major holidays and less than 20 weekly. So ultra catholics are not the majority. This can also be seen in abortion polls, most are for the status quo (over 30 percent), next is liberalization (almost 30 percent) and ultra catholic wanted bah as like 10 percent. The position of the Church, especially ultra catholics is way to high.

Also, humor and mocking is sometimes the only thing left when a group is discriminated against. Mind you, even Orban‚Äôs Hungary allows civil unions, which allow access to medical data, inheritance etc. Basic rights. NOT called a marriage, Poland does not allow even this, so people treated that badly will react in any way they can.

So while I don‚Äôt condone the mocking, I understand why they do it. Especially in the wake of abuse of power like with the rainbow Virgin Mary. LGBT people are allowed to be in the church and to use church symbols as everyone else. That was not mocking. PiS abused the rule of law and broke the flood gates for realing mocking.

That being said, this matters not at present. Neither LGBT mocking religion or PiS media writing lies about LGBT. We now have PHYSICAL ASSULT by thugs and criminals. Only on one side, the far right side supported by the government. So now support for LGBT or not is not even in issue. The issue is to put the criminals in jail and stop them being above the law and to stop propaganda which breeds such criminals. And that must be done by the state and church, as the criminals were part of PiS/Church organized counterdemonstrations, and had patriotic and church symbols on their clothes. Oh and some Nazi ones :/.

So now it‚Äôs too late to aport blame. Only one side started physical violence. And only one side is using it. And it‚Äôs not LGBT.",,/r/europe/comments/ch5865/this_lgbt_free_zone_sticker_is_added_to_todays/euqaaw0/,JoseMikey,1563974248

&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;David Cameron wanted the Great Britain to remain in the European Union, however, his frail campaign failed because he never informed the¬†British voters of the biggest advantage of staying, which is¬†EU‚Äôs new Anti Tax Avoidance Directive.  
&gt;  
&gt;To convince the British people to vote remain, Mr Cameron had to remind them that by staying in the EU,¬†his government would have had to implement EU‚Äôs Anti Tax Avoidance Directive by the year 2019, by enacting new laws and collecting taxes from everyone, including our tax-dodging billionaires.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, throughout his political career, Mr Cameron wasn‚Äôt keen on ending extreme austerity measures by collecting taxes from the wealthy elite registered in tax havens.  
&gt;  
&gt;Every time the EU undertook momentous actions to end tax-avoidance amongst its member states, Mr Cameron responded by issuing his momentous announcements regarding the British EU referendum.  
&gt;  
&gt;In January of 2013, Brussels produced a concrete action plan for a new EU directive that would end tax-avoiding practices amongst its member states, and within a month, Mr Cameron confirmed that he favours an EU-referendum  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Within that year, Mr Cameron undertook his first push to exempt¬†*Europe‚Äôs smallest entrepreneurial companies from more EU Directives*, by requesting from the President of the European Council to exclude offshore trusts from the EU‚Äôs new Anti Tax¬† Avoidance Directive.  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúDavid Cameron intervened personally to prevent offshore trusts from being dragged into an EU-wide crackdown on tax avoidance, it has emerged. In a 2013 letter to the then president of the European council, Herman Van Rompuy, the prime minister said that trusts should not automatically be subject to the same transparency requirements as companies.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Cameron announced the date for the EU referendum soon after the exact details of the EU‚Äôs¬†*Anti*‚Äì*Tax Avoidance Directive*¬†were revealed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The European¬†Commission presented¬†its¬†proposal for the¬†*Anti*‚Äì*Tax Avoidance Directive*¬†on January 28th of 2016, and within a month, Mr Cameron announced the date for the EU referendum.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shortly afterwards, Theresa Villiers, Priti Patel, Michael Gove, Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, and John Whittingdale appeared at the Vote Leave headquarters, holding a banner with a slogan ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take back control‚Äù. Speaking on behalf of six Tory Brexiteers, Grayling explained that they want to restore the sovereignty of the British nation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Backed by *The Sun*,¬†*Daily Mail*,¬†*Sunday* *Times,* *Daily¬†Express* and¬†*Telegraph*, which are owned by tax-avoiding media tycoons, Tory Brexiteers managed to protect the sovereignty of our wealthy tax-dodgers from the new EU Anti Tax Avoidance Directive.  
&gt;  
&gt;At Prime Minister‚Äôs Questions, Mr Cameron defended the offshore low tax rates, claiming:  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚ÄúWe‚Äôre happy to support blacklists but we don‚Äôt think we should draw up a blacklist solely on the basis of a territory raising a low tax rate ‚Äì we don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the right approach.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; In fact, ever since he announced his U-turn on the EU-referendum in 2013, Mr Cameron spent his time exclusively in the company of executive officials of the British pro-Brexit press, which are owned by wealthy tax-avoiding billionaires who felt threatened by the new EU Directive intended to bring an end to their tax avoiding practices.",,/r/europe/comments/ch74ed/free_ports_favoured_by_boris_johnson_are/euqaed4/,yolo4everlmi,1563974305

You are naive if u think small countries like Serbia / Albania aren't just chess pieces of big powers. I can tell u that in last 20 years every government in Serbia was chosen by global powers.

Milosevic was overthrown by millions of $ from USA/west, politicians that brought him down openly talk about it. Russia could have still supported Milosevic which would result in another bloodshed/civil war, but they made a deal with USA to give up on it, and thats why foreign minister of Russia came to Serbia after Milosevic didn't wanna recognize election results and told him to step down.

Vucic was chosen by west/USA to recognize Kosovo independence, since he controls all the right wing / patriotic groups in Serbia. He is literally on every single billboard, newspaper, tv station for 3 months before elections, his party buys votes for 20e/vote, he calls his political opponents fascists etc. All this happens and EU turns blind eye and calls him beacon of Democracy.

He kept talking about homosexuals being frustrated that he has the option to switch sides and didn't think that's ""equal"", hence rejecting him. I've seen the conversation but I wanted to dive deeper, so I asked him if I can revamp his profile a bit to do some surveying. I used my marketing skills to make the profile attractive and casually leave out the fact that he is bisexual. I did some talking with a bunch of dudes across the 2 weeks, all with him by my side. They were okay, a little bit discriminating because he had muscles, a little bit discriminating because he was shorter than 180, a little bit discriminating that he wasn't a versatile, a little bit discriminating that he had blue eyes. 

So I thought these are preferences, odd preferences but still preferences. Phase 1 was complete, phase 2 was to take out the profile entirely, then re-create it with different attractive pictures, his pictures but from different angles, but this time mentioning the bisexuality. The interest dropped dramatically and  the answer was ""sorry no BI"" for a simple ""Hello"" in many cases.

He left the online dating scene shortly after and is now in a relationship with a woman.

US patriots that were in Turkey belonged to Spain and they could remove them anytime they wanted. Turkey has no control over those Patriots. Turkey has been wanting to buy Patriots with tech transfer and the US has never agreed to it. 

&gt;  He wants out of the F-35 deal; this has many advantages for him.

I don't know how you got this idea. Just because Turkey bought S-400 doesn't mean they want out of the F-35 deal. It is the US who cancelled the Turkish order for F-35s and kicked Turkey out of the F-35 program.

&gt;  he can buy russian aircraft with full control over it meaning he can shoot down his own aircraft with his anti-air if they try funny business again.

Turkish Army has been training and using NATO equipment for years and the sudden change to Russian weaponry isn't realistic. 

&gt;  but having this Russia-China-Turkey axis going will give him the bigger strategic position because he wants the ottoman empire back so badly.

4430,"\&gt;  That what isn't true? That infants are being circumscised in a lot of places in the world? Because that is most definitely true. 

It isn't true that only circumcision of infants is being demonized in the article and in this comment section.

\&gt; I have not said they have anything to do with eachother. Both are,  however, cultural norms that have been passed down and neither has a  place in this world. 

Again, my argument is that activists (including the article in the OP) are trying to paint circumcision as comparable to FGM, which is wrong because it miscaracterizes circumcircision and it only serves to give the message ""circumcision = bad"". I mean, the very fact that they are trying to push for the terminology Male Genital Mutilation is telling.

\&gt; Secondly,  circumscision is also practiced to control male sexuality, at least in  the US. You should perhaps read up on the history of circumscision in  the US (hint: it has all to do with Mr. Kelloggs trying to stop  teenagers from mastrubating).

If you read my message, I already acknowledged the situation in the US and hinted I know perfectly well the situation there.

What I am trying to say is that the reason circumcision originally became a cultural/religious norm is because it was connected with real health/hygienic benefits. Controling male sexuality was not its original purpose.

And even though that's the reason it became common in the US, you might want to acknowledge that this is not the reason why most parents practice it today.

\&gt;  It is damaging and the health ""benefits"" are dubious at most. Here's  something for you, there have been studies showing that certain heavily  intrusive types of FGM also have health benefits. Let's allow it, shall  we?

It isn't damaging.

Please, do show me these studies and the scientific consensus on FGM.

\&gt;  No, mutilation is per definition cutting off stuff from your body.  Please remind me, what does the procedure of circumscision entail now  again? 

The word you are looking for is ""amputation"". That is the word simply meaning ""removing a body part"". (You could argue that it still has a negative connotation, but at least it's technically accurate.)

Mutilation implies damaging or disfiguring.

\&gt;  There is no scientific proof that people without toes have a worse life  than people with toes, so let us all just start cutting the toes of from  our kids. 

You are doing nothing but confirm the impression that I am talking with a fundamentalist that just wants to push his argument with ridiculous analogies.

\&gt;   Then these people can have a circumscision when they are 18. 

You are the one arguing that it should be linked with medical necessity.

\&gt;  That's on you. You know what I'm  afraid of, that my growing black spot on my back could be cancer. You  know what I do? I man the fuck up and go to the doctor to have it  checked.

* [**Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958). A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**

* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375#.pqspdcee0).

&gt; My problem isn't really with sexualities either but with transgenderism, which largely is part of LGBT as well.

In what way? As far as I know, people have never had it better than they do today, including LGBT people. It may be jarring at times, the things ""they"" are doing, but that's most of the time naught but us having a hard time getting with the times. 

A famous, anonymous quote I like goes as follows:

&gt; *When You‚Äôre Accustomed to Privilege, Equality Feels Like Oppression*

Slave owners couldn't believe anyone in their right minds would think to free slaves, it has always been this way! Racists couldn't comprehend serving people of all races in the same cafe, that's crazy!

It can be hard to fight one's own prejudices (I know, I have been and still am full of them). The best we can do is to take a step back, and attempt to analyse the situation as objectively as possible. Maybe the environment you were raised in have conditioned you to be homophobic, or transophobic. Those conditionings can be hard to shake, even when you know they're wrong.

4593,"I'm going to make a point and I think it's important to consider. The best part about my point is that it doesn't even necessarily contradicts your opinion, so we all get to keep our morals and egos in tip top shape. 

You can be uncircumcised and simply practice basic hygiene to be healthy, yes? ***Exactly***. Let's stop pretending we have no idea why circumcision exists. It's not ""just"" religion and tradition. For the vast majority of human existence the common man did **not** have access to regular maintenance and hygiene. They did not practice it because they could not. It is likely that religious justification was a natural biologically cultural response to the benefits of circumcision. Because when you are talking about a world without hygiene, there are benefits. 

This is where I concede to you though. We don't live in that world. We live in modern society with all the benefits that come with it. Including showers and bathtubs. Basic hygiene for almost everyone alive. So you're right that it's not necessary and it is just a remnant of that past. Ban it? Not sure about that. I know they are not consenting adults and may denounce their religion one day, but it is still religious and cultural. Plus, if you do live in a third world country where you don't have access to regular hygiene, there are still incentives to circumcision. There have never been benefits to FGM. Female Genital Mutilation exists for the sole purpose of controlling and hurting women. Even if you don't agree with male circumcision, let's at least admit that the ***reason*** they both exist is different. One was because they lived in a world without hygiene and complicated and frankly interesting culture developed around it and the other is just control and domination over the opposite sex. You can say the reason doesn't matter and they're still both bad... and I am actually okay with that. I can't argue with you further from there.

Generally, everyone thinks their penis is the better penis. We're men, and this is probably the most biased thing we can have an opinion on.

If agreed: So, if it were illegal to circumcise before you're 18, pretty much no one would do it, as they grew up uncircumcised. BUT, pretty much everyone who grew up circumcised is very glad it was done as a baby. 

So, if everyone is happy with their penis (and there is no harm in the operation), why do you think the government should impose their views on the people about penis shape? 

If you don't like the breastfeeding example, what about religion? Most people grow up to be the same religion they were raised as (or turn atheist/agnostic). Since everyone has the freedom of religion, is it wrong to impose your beliefs on your child? Make it illegal to indoctrinate a child until they are 18?

From Wikipedia's article on the history of circumcision:

According to Genesis, God told Abraham to circumcise himself, his household and his slaves as an everlasting covenant (i.e., binding contract) in their flesh. Those who were not circumcised were to be ""cut off"" from their people.Covenants in biblical times were often sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate.

They will argue Scots and therefore by proxy Scotland as a nation was disproportionately involved at the highest levels in war and colonialism - they may say this amounts to say 10% involvement compared to say 8% which would be more proportionate to population size - I would argue neither percentage could be considered heavy involvement nor are ever actually accurately calculated compared to population size at the time and any disproportionally high involvement usually came down to *manpower* (troops for the British Armed Forces or workers in the Ulster Plantations) - to flip this for every Scot involved in a UK endeavour you can expect up to 92% English involvement on similar levels or higher up the chain of command - right up to the Royal Family who only have trace ancestry to Scottish Royalty",DNA% 54üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø19üá©üá™11üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø7üá≥üá¥6üá∏üáÆ3üá´üá∑,/r/europe/comments/cgyqfe/hmm_found_in_modlin_poland/eup85i9/,Jiao_Dai,1563952996

4725,"There is an apparent reason: our notions of freedom and tolerance are so radically different, I don't know it's possible for you to really apprehend what the words mean in your paradigm.

It's common for European leftists (who have, as an implicit assumption, a notion that the Democratic State is a kind of monarch, whose pleasure is tantamount to law) to assume that everything that is not explicitly desired (and permitted) is justly prohibited.

For us, the fact that a majority - even a significant majority - of people don't like something I do in good conscience means that the vast majority of people can go f---- themselves.

Specifically in this case, for some reason, all you people are basically agreeing with positions taken by some Dark Ages and Medieval Roman Catholic theologians, who also suggested the practice was barbaric and unholy, and should be barred as being unnecessary for everybody - but most especially since Jews and Muslims practiced it. It would be natural for anybody to assume your reasoning was the same.

I mean - is this really the hill you want to charge up? I guess if you guys are all really hardcore, traditionalist Roman Catholics, then the argument makes sense.

But for everybody else, I thought the position was that there is no fundamental good or evil, everything is relative to culture, multiculturalism is awesome, and people have a freedom to do what they feel they should according to their own conscience, and that freedom extends to the decisions they make on behalf of their children (including and up to, if the parents believe their children are misgendered, chemical and clinical mutilation).

Or, your analysis seems to be, as in the case of communistic leftists, everybody is a resource - property, a slave - of the State, and the State shouldn't allow its resources to be affected by any kind of religion, and parents shouldn't be permitted to follow their consciences (well, except for genital surgery, and permitting assisted suicide).

(Just for completeness sake: how a real traditional Catholic deals with the facts of circumcision today is that Jesus was a Jew and circumcised, Mary was a Jew and made our mother, and so we are Jews - spiritual Semites - and that being more like Jesus is better than being less like him. Thus, circumcision is neither required nor prohibited - and isn't that a perfectly tolerant solution?)",,/r/europe/comments/cgucw0/opinion_male_circumcision_needs_to_be_seen_as/euoqng4/,starverer,1563945499

4741,"For those wondering about the parties:

- **Servant of the People**: Led by current President and former comedian Volodymyr Zelensky. The party is pro-European, strongly focused on anti-corruption, and vaguely liberal, but is otherwise rather loose on ideology in favor of a populist and anti-establishment message.

- **Opposition Platform-For Life**: The latest in a long line of pro-Russian parties, succeeding the *Opposition Bloc* before it and Yanukovych's infamous *Party of Regions* before that. It is anti-nationalist, opposes the promotion of the Ukrainian language, strongly opposes EU and NATO membership, and  supports devolution of powers to Ukraine's regions. Economically, it is anti-neoliberalism and defends the economic interests of pro-Russian oligarchs and the eastern regions. Politically toxic for every other major party, for obvious reasons. Most support comes from Easterners or the politically nostalgic.

- **European Solidarity**: A re-branding of the *Petro Poroshenko Bloc* led by, well, ex-President and oligarch Petro Poroshenko. As you can probably guess by its name, it is pro-European. Otherwise, it is a conservative and moderately nationalist party. Poroshenko left office with very low approval ratings due to the stalling of economic and political reform. However, his foreign policy and military reforms have been seen as more successful, and this, along with his nationalist messaging, has helped him keep some supporters.

- **Fatherland**: A rather weird party, it is essentially the personal vehicle of Yulia Tymoshenko. Once a political maverick, many now regard her as old news. Still, she remains a divisive and controversial figure, but one with a firm core of supporters. As a personality party, it's quite vulnerable to changes in ideology and platform based on Tymoshenko's whims, but has generally been right-of-center and pro-European.

- **Voice**: Led by former rock star Svyatoslav Varachuk, the party is similar to *Servant of the People* in its anti-establishment and anti-corruption message. However, it brands itself as a more serious, policy-minded alternative to *Servant*, with a clearer ideological base (liberalism, in this case) and more ties to civil society groups.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ch31ho/the_distribution_of_seats_in_ukraines_newly/euor5xg/,jogarz,1563945689

4774,"I'm 32 (not 35) and was circumcised a couple years ago.  I did it because I had mild phimosis which wasn't normally an issue except it made sex uncomfortable at best and painful at worst. I had grappled with deciding whether or not to get circumcised since I was a teenager and after reading all of the anti circumcision horror stories I finally built up the courage to go through with it.  AND... It hurt.  Quite a bit.  But it wasn't torture.  It took several weeks to recover and the chaffing/itching was pretty rough.  After over a month and a half of healing my wife and I decided I was ready for sex and we went for it.  It was awesome.  It was way better because there was no tight foreskin, no trouble with getting my foreskin stuck pulled down below my head. And I could really feel my wife better than I had before.  Things felt different and amazing.  

My one regret is listening to all the people saying so much scary stuff about circumcision and putting it off for so long.  Imagine missing out on ten years of great sex because people had been proselytizing the evils of circumcision and you just accepted it.  That was me.  I honestly hate threads like this that get pushed with such fervor.  

For the record, when my son was born I chose to have him circumcised because you can't predict if a child will be affected by phimosis.  So with my experience a preventative procedure (especially for a child so young they won't remember it) is worth way more than the potential suffering and lost time as an adult.",,/r/europe/comments/cgucw0/opinion_male_circumcision_needs_to_be_seen_as/euos0r2/,ButButtJoke,1563946049

When what we consider to be normal is no longer in line with what is considered to be factual or scientifically relevant, it is again our responsibility as adults to re-examine our existing belief structure and reconcile the change.

&amp;#x200B;

Vaccination is a great example. There is no legitimate science that supports the anti-vax movement, and yet parents are deciding to ignore doctors worldwide who support the legitimacy of vaccination in favour of a solution that seems more comfortable and normal to them. The time will come (I hope) where they realize that they made the wrong decision, and they will have to explain to their children why they thought their comfort as a parent was more legitimate than the scientific consensus that defied their beliefs. It has and will be the exact same thing with circumcision.

&amp;#x200B;

You are your own person, but if I were raising a child and I was put in a position if choosing between what's normal for me and what is scientifically substantiated even at my own expense, for the sake of the child the choice should be extremely clear.",,/r/europe/comments/cgucw0/opinion_male_circumcision_needs_to_be_seen_as/euo8025/,AberforthBrixby,1563938411

&gt;men have been oppressing women for thousands of years. Pretty sure we win the ‚Äúoppression olympics‚Äù between men vs women.

In the west sure. However these practices also take place in cultures with no concept of patriarchy. Trying to apply a patriarchal lens as if patriarchy was some sort of human constant is downright absurd.

&gt;How are women ‚Äúokay‚Äù with these practices?

Idk, ask them. Shouldn't you be trying to hear their opinion on the matter?  
Here's what they say on the matter:  
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/04/female-genital-mutilation-cutting-anthropologist/389640/  
https://www.jstor.org/stable/27563985?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

Even fathers who choose not to have their daughters go through it find them mutilated after an arranged visit by the grandmother. https://www.jstor.org/stable/643328

&gt;It‚Äôs forced onto them.

By other women, not men. Refer to the same sources above.

&gt;because people like you are still actively trying to downplay the struggles we experience every single day.

People like me? You're the one ignoring the voices of those who go through it. Besides, you're quite literally doing the exact same thing in regards to men's issues. Listen to your own advice.

&gt;If you men really want male circumcision to be treated the same as FGM- fight for it.

You tell me to fight and yet you try to undermine any effort of it. My exact point is that FGM is only vilified (and rightfully so) because it isn't practiced as commonly but that in cultures where it is, women are mostly fine with it. Much like men who tend to go through circumcision are fine with it (and you'll find a lot of those types in this thread)

&gt;But I am a woman. And yeah, I‚Äôll speak for my gender

It would be rather ignorant to assume that, because you share a characteristic, someone from a completely different social background would face the same social issue you do. And it would be even more absurd to speak for people who you never met or even heard of.

&gt;Men are used to being born with all of their rights and privileges handed to them. No hate, it‚Äôs history.

Absolutely, but it's mostly Western history. That's where your assumption breaks down because these women are largely not western. Their social context and background is not one of deprivation of rights as easily as we know western history to be.

&gt;But downplaying FGM

You're overplaying it and you will sound absurd to these women because their reality is simply different. I've had my own issues convincing circumcized men that circumcision is bad (even without mentioning FGM). I can only imagine whar it would be knowing that there's a language barrier between you and most of these women.

&gt;and shitting on women‚Äôs struggles is NOT going to get you anywhere lol.

I'm not. You're the one shitting on men's struggles.

&gt;You can advocate for one thing without invalidating other things.

Then don't try to invalidate men's just because you think the worst forms of FGM currently in practice (which would be cliterodectomy and infibulation) aren't comparable to the worst form of MGM in practice (which would be circumcision and any of these: https://www.healthline.com/health/penis-splitting).

4913,"&gt;proven health benefits 

Health benefits, *right.* The benefits it gives are nearly entirely negligible if the man just washes his penis enough and practices safe sex. Which is what happens in Europe.

Again, sometimes morals clash. The morals that are clashing here are the protecting the health of children and the right of bodily autonomy and religion of freedom. 

So on one side there is a ridiculously small amount of health benefits and freedom of religion.

On the other side there is a serious breach of bodily autonomy and freedom of religion, with addition the small risk of the operation going wrong. 

&gt;I‚Äôd say vaccinations is a great logical comparison.

The situations are too different. Vaccinations have an undisputed huge, huge health benefit to not only the vaccinee, but also everyone else because of herd immunity. The problem with this analogy is that vaccinations have an entirely different purpose and have entirely different arguments to defend/attack. 

On the surface it seems like a great logical comparison, but it really isn't. Comparing problem A to problem B isn't going to make solving problem A easier. **Honestly, the only reason you want to compare it to vaccinations is because you want to make me argue against vaccinations; to make your side of the argument stronger. That's dirty and uncool.**

4936,"Sorry mate ‚Äî¬†you've been conned.

You quote the Mayo Clinic; and they refer to the AAP for the ""health benefits"".

Ah yes: the American Academy of Pediatrics LOL üòÄ

According to the AAP ‚Äî they are *not* pro-circumcision. Their wording was very careful ‚Äî they don't *recommend* it, but they do *justify access* to it. And later in the report they state:  *‚Äú...health benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision.‚Äù*

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/585

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/e756

And yet Dr. Andrew L. Freedman, one of the senior members of the ""task force"" on circumcision for the AAP has now clearly stated:

*""To many, especially in the lay press, this was interpreted as moving the needle from a neutral stance, as the 1999 guidelines were viewed, to being pro circumcision.""* [ie: the lay press were wrong].

Freedman has now come out and admitted, that the AAP ""report"" was nothing more than a sap to ""multiculturalism"" and that they took numerous non-medical issues into consideration, whilst at the same time stating that were doing the opposite: *""although we claim authority in the medical realm, we have no standing to judge on these other elements.""* And yet ‚Äî that's *exactly* what they did!

So the AAP has now admitted, that their ""medical"" report was really about just allowing religious people to continue their sexual abuse and mutilation of infant boys.

The American Academy of Pediatrics is a *trade* organisation, and exists for the promotion of its members - paediatric doctors. It is not, and never will be, a *patient* advocacy group.

The AAP members make millions of dollars from circumcision infant baby boys, and millions more from selling the amputated foreskins for medical research and cosmetics:

http://www.foreskin.org/f4sale.htm

And even more money fixing ""botched"" circumcisions ‚Äî which can be 20% of their income! See below.

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.full.pdf+html

The British Medical Journal also published an extensive critique:

http://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2013/03/19/journal-of-medical-ethics-special-issue-on-circumcision/?q=w_jme_blog_sidetab

Also the Journal of Medical Ethics:

http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2013/03/18/medethics-2013-101346.abstract

The Danish Society of Family Physicians has even declared male ""circumcision"" to be genital mutilation. Other countries in Europe will soon follow:

*‚ÄúThe National Board of Health has sent Guidelines Regarding Circumcision of Boys into hearing. DSAM (Danish Society of Family Physicians) has debated the issue and agreed that circumcision may only be performed when medical indication is present. Circumcision in the absence of a medical indication is mutilation.‚Äù*

Plus, the circumcision policy committee of the APP had many members with a conflict of interest, not least because of their religious belief in the requirement by their God to have their sons' penises mutilated as a sign of their devotion and love.

These people are terrified that the general public is going to get wise to this child-abuse and ban it.

Dr. Andrew Freedman was one of the members of the committee, and was asked:

*""Do you have a son and, if so, did you have him circumcised?""*

""Yes, I do. I circumcised him myself on my parents‚Äô kitchen table on the eighth day of his life. But I did it for religious, not medical reasons. I did it because I had 3,000 years of ancestors looking over my shoulder.""

http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/new-york-minute/fleshing-out-change-circumcision

So he didn't have 100 million years of human evolution and Charles Darwin looking over his shoulder then? *Every* male mammal in the animal kingdom is born with a foreskin, so it evolved for *reasons*.

Not only that, Dr. Andrew Freedman makes 20% of his income from treating circumcisions that have gone wrong! (But note that *every* circumcision is a botch job). So he makes $500 a pop for circumcising boys, and then more $$$$ for fixing the problems!

*""As a practicing pediatric urologist, 20% of the patients I will see today are here because of something related to their circumcision.""*

http://www.amednews.com/article/20120903/health/309039955/4/

Here is the AAP policy statement. Can you please point me to the section where there task force members state their ""conflicts of interest""? (Hint: you won't find it because it doesn't exist):

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/08/22/peds.2012-1989.full.pdf+html

Note that as three of the task force members were women; and the rest men all born before 1980, there is a very high degree of certainty that none of them possess a male foreskin.

In addition, at least four of them subscribe to a set of theological beliefs that require them to mutilate the genitals of their infant sons. And one of whom (as detailed previously) did so on his kitchen table. Not only is this in violation of the AAP‚Äôs code of bioethics prohibiting physicians from conducting surgery on family members (let alone in non-sterile environments), it also provides additional evidence of a pro-circumcision bias among the hand-picked task force members.

These people will mutilate your penis just because they think it pleases their sky-god. Forget about ""medical benefits"".

And recently, Steven Svoboda, a Harvard educated lawyer who runs ""Attorneys for the rights of the child"", debated two of the AAPs ""Taskforce on Circumcision"" members: Michael Brady, M.D. and Douglas Diekema, M.D.:

*""Asked if people present could explain the functions of the foreskin Brady said, ‚ÄúI don't think anybody knows the functions of the foreskin,‚Äù then reiterated, in nearly identical words, ‚ÄúNobody knows the functions of the foreskin.‚Äù I noted that there was not a word about the functions of the foreskin in the 2012 AAP report, and asked, shouldn't we know something about the functions of the healthy body part that is being removed?""*

Tellingly, the AAP pamphlet ""Care of the Uncircumcised Penis"", used to contain this information:

*""The glans at birth is delicate and easily irritated by urine and feces. The foreskin shields the glans; with circumcision, this protection is lost. In such cases, the glans and especially the urinary opening may become irritated or infected, causing ulcers, meatitis, and meatal stenosis. Such problems virtually never occur in uncircumcised penises. The foreskin protects the glans throughout life"".*

But this was deleted in the 1996 reprint, and despite numerous letters to the editors, no explanation was ever given as to why it was removed. Of course the reason is obvious: they want to deny that the male foreskin has any function at all, so they can continue to mutilate infant boys.

http://www.circumcision.org/pamphlet.htm

The foreskin is not ""just a little bit of skin."" The foreskin is a complex, double-layered fold of flesh, laden in thousands of nerves and blood vessels. Keep in mind that as a child grows into a man, his foreskin grows too; it isn't so little by the time the child is an adult. And adult foreskin can be from 12 to 15 square inches in size.

The foreskin is not a birth defect.

Neither is it a congenital deformity or genetic anomaly akin to a 6th finger or a cleft.

Neither is it a medical condition like a ruptured appendix or diseased gall bladder.

Neither is it a dead part of the body, like the umbilical cord, hair, or fingernails.

The foreskin is not ""extra skin."" The foreskin is normal, natural, healthy, functioning tissue, with which all boys are born; it is as intrinsic to male genitalia as labia are to female genitalia.

Unless there is a medical or clinical indication, the circumcision of a healthy, non-consenting individual is a deliberate wound; it is the destruction of normal, healthy tissue, the permanent disfigurement of normal, healthy organs, and by very definition, infant genital mutilation, and a violation of the most basic of human rights.

&amp;#x200B;

Masturbation helps phimosis because it stretches the foreskin (there are better techniques than jerking off, by the way), but not all cases of phimosis can be treated with stretching. The next step is generally steroid creams that thin out the skin and reduce the inflammatory responses from your body, but that also has it's limits.

&amp;#x200B;

In some cases phimosis can be so severe that there's absolutely \*zero\* retraction of the foreskin. For example sometimes the penis gland doesn't detach itself from the foreskin during penis growth. Sometimes the frenulum (that weird ""vein"" connecting your gland to the shaft) is too short and also makes it impossible for the foreskin to move much.

5252,"&gt;The Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) does not recommend circumcision

&gt;I am not the one ""debunking"" an official statement by the American Academy of Pediatricians, am I? 

I like how you use Canada in a bad attempt to back yourself up, and then ignore everything else as 'non American and therefore bad'.

I also like how you've gone off on everyone except [my response to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/cgucw0/z/eulflbq), which was quoting the AAP itself.


But let's see what else the Canadian Paediatrics Society says:


&gt;Neonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker ‚Äì usually their parents ‚Äì to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, **authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary.** In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.


http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision


And of course their top line recommendation: 

[""The Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend the routine circumcision of every newborn male.‚Äù](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) 

We can go over all the stats they present too. Suffice to say it's terrible.

Anna stove you effectively ask for a rebuttal, the AAP position has also attracted this critique by 39 notable doctors: [""Seen from the outside, cultural bias reflecting the normality of nontherapeutic male circumcision in the United States seems obvious, and the report‚Äôs conclusions are different from those reached by physicians in other parts of the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and Australia.""](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)


[‚ÄúIt seems that the authors of the AAP report consider the foreskin to be a part of the male body that has no meaningful function in sexuality. However, the foreskin is a richly innervated structure that protects the glans and plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts.16‚Äì20 Recent studies, several of which were not included in the AAP report (although they were published within the inclusion period of 1995‚Äì2010), suggest that circumcision desensitizes the penis21,22 and may lead to sexual problems in circumcised men and their partners.23‚Äì29 In light of these uncertainties, physicians should heed the precautionary principle and not recommend circumcision for preventive reasons.‚Äù](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)",,/r/europe/comments/cgucw0/opinion_male_circumcision_needs_to_be_seen_as/eum0a7e/,intactisnormal,1563909712

He predicted all this in 2015 that he correctly anticipated exactly how the EU would approach negotiations years before it happend gives him an awful lot of credibility.

&gt;Ya sure. I guess theres no point saying that the negotiation position wont be any better after No-Deal Brexit, and that its a scynical and inhumane move to push for a hard border with the goal to blackmail the EU with potential lives lost in Northern Island.

The UK is not pushing for a hard border, but the EU does not negotiate unless it has to. No-deal means the EU has to face problems that can easily be solved by reaching agreement with the UK, that gives them the motivation to actually negotiate.",,/r/europe/comments/cgr6t0/boris_johnson_voted_for_as_tory_party_leader_and/eukzi4h/,Outrageous_Quantity,1563895058

5435,"&gt;Extinction Rebellion climate activists disrupted the opening speech of Shell CEO Ben van Beurden. This happened during an event on climate change sponsored by the oil company. Activists unrolled a banner with the text ""SHELL KILLS"" and gave a prepared speech in which they proclaimed the ecological and climate emergency during the welcome speech of Van Beurden. European Commissioner for Climate Miguel Arias Ca√±ete was also present at the meeting organised by Politico.

&gt;A spokesman for Extinction Rebellion Belgium said: ""The government and the media must tell the truth - the world is threatened by climate change and ecological collapse, and this crisis has been caused by fossil fuel companies like Shell. Shell knew about this climate and ecological crisis but kept it a secret to protect their profits. Every day they continue to cling to oil and gas, more lives are lost. It is a shame that a media company is organising a Shell-sponsored event on climate change, and it is a shame that an EU climate commissioners are taking part in it.""

&gt;Shell blocks climate action
Internal documents show that Shell and Exxon Mobil have known about the climate impact of fossil fuels since the 1980s.

&gt;For years, Shell has funded lobby groups that have been actively involved in denying climate science.

&gt;Shell spends tens of millions of euros a year on lobbying to slow down, control or block climate change policies.

&gt;Political sponsorship
Politico's events and newsletters are regularly sponsored by fossil fuel companies or fossil industry lobby groups.

5492,"&gt; The simple explanation for the backstop is that it represents the annexation of Northern Ireland, this was referred to as the 'price to pay' by Martin Selmayr.

My comment above wasn't disagreeing with that.

My point was just that I don't see how there would be belief that the UK would have a preference ordering other than the one I described, don't see how one would believe that the UK would rather have a trade deal -- *any* trade deal that the EU would realistically put on the table -- than NI.

But even if one truly believed that...the strongest way the EU can make to do a good-faith ""NI for trade deal"" offer is to say that the backstop only enters into force *if* the UK signs the subsequent trade deal.  The EU didn't do that, so what it has on the table is ""we will give you a trade deal in exchange for NI...but *we will not tell you the contents of that trade deal*"".  The only sense in not disclosing the contents of the trade deal is if the EU doesn't feel that they make the deal more-compelling to the UK.  The only sane thing that the UK can do in response to the EU taking such a stance is to expect nothing of value to the UK from the trade deal.

I mean, this has got to be one of the more-important negotiations that has happened in the world, and the parties involved are some of the more-serious players in business and diplomacy, so I'd expect best-in-the-world negotiators and A-game negotiation from both sides, but the EU's position damned impossible to understand.  Not just demanding a high price, but not making sense.

Well, if it does go to no-deal, I expect that there will be post-mortems written about this, and maybe people with a more-extensive background in negotiation than I will explain why the position could make sense.  I've banged my head on it quite a bit.

So far, the most-plausible argument I've heard for the position on Reddit has been from some Irish guy saying essentially that the RoI isn't acting as a self-interested party, but that domestic politics dominate this, that it's not politically possible in Ireland for Irish government to drop the demand.  In that sort of analysis, you'd have divergence between the interests of RoI the country and the current government.  That seems absolutely staggering, but, well, who knows.

Another possibility is that the RoI believes that they've a route to acquire NI as a *result* of no-deal and desires no-deal to achieve that route, whereas I'm pretty confident that no-deal closes the RoI's door to pick up NI.  But maybe I've missed something.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cgr6t0/boris_johnson_voted_for_as_tory_party_leader_and/eul15qx/,vokegaf,1563895660

Yes, that's a no-deal Brexit.. But do you have any idea what this means in practice? Besides huge tariffs (which you'll unilaterally drop at imports so UK companies don't go bankrupt and people loose their jobs) -- I mean half of your imports are from EU? But exports will suffer big time (maybe US might buy some stuff, but they already told you the price -- NHS);

&gt;until the EU is willing to drop its demands for the backstop and negotiate a FTA setup

Backstop without freedom of movement there and complete EU-market rules in Northen Ireland won't happen (so you setup an internal border between UK and Northen Ireland and have basically 2 economic systems functioning in UK); 

That's the fucking power of the EU/EEA.. They won't just allow a bordless back entrance; It's not about the fucking licence plates and people moving in Ireland.. It's about cargo movement;

Growth has been sluggish here but there has been growth nonetheless, therefore we are also on the boom side of the business cycle. We have also seen a lot of new employment. Just because we have been growing less than the US does not mean we will somehow grow more than them in the future. 

I do agree with you that fiscal policy is more effective than monetary. But it is also more expensive. Europe has been desperately needing a fiscal stimulus since the 2008 crisis. But are we going to get it? No. 

There is no political will for it in most northern and central EU countries. Specially Germany. 

It's true the US started fiscal stimulus too soon and that the benefits are heavily skewed towards the upper classes. However, right now is indeed a good time for fiscal stimulus, because everyone is expecting a downtrend and possibly a recession. 

So what will happen if fiscal policy in Europe does not change? I expect the next recession to hit Europe harder than the rest of the world (US, China). And I also expect growth to pick up more slowly here. 

What happens if fiscal policy changes? It depends on what will change, but I wager the outcome will be better for the EU and EU citizens.",,/r/europe/comments/cg1iuf/europe_is_sleepwalking_its_way_to_another_lost/eukgvx2/,park777,1563888153

5689,"Did you know, Botswana has been hailed one of the World's great development success stories. This is due to good governance and using income generated through the mining industries to diversify their economy. Gaborone for example is aiming to become the banking hub of Africa. The economy itself has been growing steadily at a high rate and has lifted thousands out of poverty. But there are downsides to this growth. Botswana has one of the highest inequality ratings in the World and still grapples with unemployment levels of around 20%. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS remain a massive problem in the country. 

Their population is expected to soar from 2m today, to 3.5m by 2050. If they manage to continue their economic transformation, we can also expect to see an increase in potential immigration from the neighbouring countries and all over Africa. Botswana has done well with the situation they were handed, but still face numerous challenges in the coming years, but also possibilities.

This would definitely not be cheaper, in fact, you'd have to house all the people during the process, and build brand new buildings, which are multiple times more exepensive than upgrading the existing ones. I get it, *khrushchyovkas'* fatal flaw is that they're hopelessly cramped and you can't fix that. Giant metropolis like Moscow can afford to just take them down and build new developments instead, but we have no comparable concentration of wealth here.

While talks of demolishing it have been around ever since USSR collapsed, that has not happened, as each apartment houses a family who'd probably not be ready to abandon their homes and pay for brand new ones, and the town needs its money used elsewhere.

&gt; Someone with a life sentence and no chance to get out has no hope and no reason to change his behaviour. They tend to become unpredictable and a threat to wardens and other inmates.

No. Because inmates sentenced for life have a right of parole, and his sentence can be reduced after some time and under certain conditions. So contrary to what you are saying he has zachƒôta
inmates incentive to behave better.

&gt; The only ""advantage"" your outlook on life sentences has is that you'd get to jerk off over how tough you've made it for criminals and how oh so just you are, while making it harder and riskier for everyone who is actually involved in carrying out the sentence, the good ones as well as the criminals.
