0,"The import of European mineral water and several food products into Britain could be restricted under retaliatory measures being considered by ministers over Brussels' refusal to end its blockade on UK shellfish.

The Telegraph can disclose that ministers are looking at proposals dubbed ""Water Wars"" which could see the UK end a number of continuity arrangements it has agreed with the EU.

Senior Government sources pointed to potential restrictions on the import of mineral water and seed potatoes, the latter of which the EU has secured a temporary agreement on until the end of June.

In a warning shot to Brussels, a Government source said: ‚ÄúThere is thought being given to where we can leverage in other areas. We have continuity arrangements... we can stop these which means they won‚Äôt be able to sell their produce here.‚Äù

The discussions over tit-for-tat measures began earlier this month after the European Commission announced that a ban on the export of live oysters, clams, scallops and mussels from Britain‚Äôs class B waters would become permanent because it is now listed as a third country.

It can now be disclosed that ministers have escalated contingency planning after Stella Kyriakides, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, snubbed a request to meet the Environment Secretary George Eustice to try and resolve the row.

Mr Johnson is said to be personally angered by the move, which took ministers by surprise and which officials claim contradicted earlier assurances they had been given by the Commission.

On Saturday night, the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs announced it would now widen the eligibility of the ¬£23m support package it has announced for the fishing industry, in order to help fishermen and shellfish exporters affected by the ban.

The grants, which will begin in March, will cover three months of average fixed costs, and will be open to certain boats and shellfish exporters who have been hit by falling demand domestically during lockdown and disruption in exporting to the EU.

It is understood that officials are focussing on products which are already readily available in the UK, so as not to disadvantage British consumers.

It comes amid a series of other major flashpoints with the EU, including over vaccines, the post-Brexit arrangements for trade in Northern Ireland, and the status of the two sides‚Äô respective ambassadors in London and Brussels.

This week Lord Frost, Mr Johnson‚Äôs chief Brexit negotiator, was appointed to the Cabinet and assumed many of Michael Gove‚Äôs responsibilities for managing future relations with Brussels.

Whitehall insiders have claimed his appointment is partly a signal of intent from the Prime Minister, who is said to want to take a ‚Äúpunchier‚Äù response to the EU and its ‚Äúoverly-bureaucratic‚Äù approach to the Northern Ireland protocol.

The protocol was set up to smooth trade friction created by the province remaining in the UK internal market while applying EU customs rules, but has been blamed for causing major disruption for traders moving goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.

On Firday, Lord Trimble, an architect of the Good Friday Agreement, joined calls from the DUP to scrap the protocol altogether, warning that it ‚Äúwillfully tears‚Äù up the ‚Äúhard-fought‚Äù gains of the peace process.

Writing for the Irish Times, the former Ulster Unionist Party leader warned that the ‚Äúunintended but unquestionably escalating tensions‚Äù created by it ‚Äúrepresent a real and present danger to the lives of people living in Northern Ireland‚Äù.

Separately, The Telegraph can also disclose that Ben Habib, a former Brexit Party MEP, crossbench peer Baroness Hoey, and Jim Allister, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, are threatening a legal challenge against the Government to try and overturn it.

Arguing that the protocol flies in the face of the Act of Union 1800, the Good Friday Agreement, and that it effectively ‚Äúpartitions the UK‚Äù, they have instructed John Larkin QC, the former attorney general of Northern Ireland, to seek a judicial review, and have issued a letter before action to the Crown Solicitor‚Äôs Office.

Writing in The Telegraph on the fund for fisherman, Mr Eustice said: ""The UK fishing industry produces some of the finest seafood in Europe from the waters around our coast.

""By supporting the sector through some of the current challenges we will ensure they are well placed to recover once the world turns the corner on this pandemic and emerges from lockdown.""",Eire - British Isles üá¨üáßü§ùüá®üá≠,/r/europe/comments/lotv2j/exclusive_britain_could_declare_brexit_water_wars/go7p5gn/,TirNaNog84,1613901146

Yes, most of it was destroyed. Yes, not nearly enough has been reconstructed.

But the old town still remains quite beautiful. Not necessarily because of the original buildings, but because there are strict laws for building in the old town now. Houses have to keep the original shape and looks of historical Nuremberg, roofs have to look the same. The street layout is mostly original as it has been for the past thousand years. You can SEE and FEEL the thousand years this city has been around. It keeps its medieval charm but it also doesn't hide the ugly sides of the war that has become part of its identity.

Even outside of the old town Nuremberg is WAY better off than most rebuilt cities. Trust me, I spent a couple years in the likes of Kassel. Even the hastily rebuilt parts of this huge city of Nuremberg definitely win the beauty contest there. We don't have nearly as many actually hideous 50s buildings as Kassel and many other cities. Yes, we do have them. But they don't make up most of the city. There's plenty of amazing old pre-war buildings in all of the city, and the street layouts and generous size of the city give it its charm. Nuremberg looks and feels *very* different from other rebuilt cities. I became extremely aware of this when I spent years in Kassel and got to see what a truly hideous city looks like.

61,"&gt;Italy seems to me \[...\] to be almost an explosion of parties 

Oh, that is surely true. However, many of those parties are ""personal parties"" on the centre (for example: Italia Viva = Renzi; Azione = Calenda, almost the same ideas but the two leaders do not like each other that much) and on the left, where every MP has basically his own party or current.

&gt;and ideas

Unfortunately not. Ideas are, more or less:

* ""Europe bad, stop immigration, traditional family"" for Fratelli d'Italia
* ""Europe bad but not anymore, stop immigration, traditional family, *progressive flat tax* (!!)"" for the League
* doing Berlusconi's interests for Forza Italia
* ""we love Europe and we are the only alternative to the right wing"" on the left. Literally, we have the right wing polling at 40% and the only idea you come up with, as the main centre-left party, is to say that you are not right wing. As a potential centre-left voter, it is really frustrating: I do not want to vote the right wing, but I would not want to vote for someone only because he is not the right wing. And the most impressive thing is that the Democratic Party still is the second most popular party, polling at 20%, despite this.

&gt;it seems frightening but at the same time almost healthier to admit that the way forward is unclear and difficult

The problem is that the way forward is too unclear: nothing stops anyone from starting a crisis for no reason, so the way forward is always to be sure that the smallest, but decisive party is happy, otherwise everything collapses. And that is exactly what happened last month. With a decent political class, it would surely be healthier.

&gt;our way which is basically elected dictatorship 

Your system is the perfect demonstration of why I definitely do not want the first-past-the-post, which is incredibly popular in Italy as many wants ""stable governments"". Sometimes however it seems that *we* want an elected dictatorship, as saying ""let's give the majority to whoever comes first so that he can govern five years without risking to collapse"" is extremely popular, and as people vote for the leader rather than for the party's ideas. Personal parties are a thing also on the right-wing, and on that side they are (too) big.

&gt;So I wonder if there is any sign of optimism in Italy yet 

No. Not because of Draghi, who is probably the best man Italy can have right now, but because of the parties supporting him: after all we are a parliamentary democracy and Parliament decides... and it is very difficult to be optimist with the current Parliament, probably the most embarassing one since the birth of the Republic.

From the recent history, you can easily say we are part of Balkan but that only goes for 100 years or our nation's existence while through most of the history of Europe we were always part of either the [Austria-Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary) or [Holy roman empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) and the first kingdom that people who migrated and that lived here were part [Samo's Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samo). Not to mention a lot of german writing which describes us as Wenden which means ""western Slavs"" or Slavs that lived near german settlements. And that Balkan comes from Ottoman times because the ottomans gave the land of south-east Europe when they had it under control the name Balkan which in Turkish means ""mountain chain"" (if I'm not mistaken) and we were never part of the Ottoman empire.

Vanturile
In general teritoriul orasului si zonele sale limitrofe inconjurate de paduri beneficiaza de o circulatie normala a maselor de aer, deosebit de favorabila mentinerii unei atmosfere relativ stabile. Vanturile dominante, resimtite in toate anotimpurile, sunt cele de est (21,2%), urmate de cele din vest (16,3%), nord-est (14,2%) si sud-vest (11,2%). Frecventa calmului atmosferic este de 18,9%. In cea ce priveste viteza lor, cele mai mari valori medii anuale le inregistreaza vanturile de nord-est (2,4 m/s), urmate de cele din est si vest (cu 2,3 m/s). Numarul zilelor cu vant tare (peste 16 m/s) este in medie de 14 pe an. Ca si in cazul regimului temperaturilor, analiza vanturilor evidentiaza aceleasi diferentieri intre perimetrul construit si zona sa exterioara. Rolul de obstacol pe care il indeplinesc constructiile orasului face ca situatiile de calm sa aiba o frecventa de 2 ori mai mare fata de zona periferica.

This is a short text on the winds of Bucharest and I will translate it.
The Winds
In general the territory of the city and its suburbs, surrounded by forests benefit from a normal circulation  of air masses, necessary for keeping a relatively stable atmosphere. The dominant winds, felt throughout all seasons, are the eastern winds (21,2%), followed by the western winds (16,3%), north-eastern winds (14,2%) and south-western winds (11,2%). The frequency of wind convergence is 18,9%. In regard of their speed, the largest annual average values are recorded by the north-eastern winds (2,4 metres/second), followed by the eastern and western winds (2,3 m/s). The number of days with strong winds (over 16 m/s) is on average 14 days per year. Just like in the case of temperature regimes, the analysis of winds show the same difference between the built perimeter and the areas outside it. The role as an obstacle which the buildings of the city fullfill makes the frequency of wind convergence to be twice more likely on the edges of the city.",,/r/europe/comments/loeuct/bucharest_romania/go7jew4/,Beautiful_Romania,1613895593

Nuremberg is the second-largest city of the German state of Bavaria after its capital Munich, and its 518,370 inhabitants make it the 14th-largest city in Germany.

The city was first mentioned in 1050 in official records as Noremberg, but it had its origin in a castle (now known as Kaiserburg \[imperial castle\]) built about 10 years earlier by the German king Henry III, duke of Bavaria, who became in 1046 Holy Roman emperor. A settlement developed around the castle, and in 1219 the city was granted its first charter. The city soon gained full independence, becoming a free imperial city.

In the 1930s N√ºrnberg became a centre of the Nazi Party and in 1935 gave its name to the anti-Semitic N√ºrnberg decrees (see N√ºrnberg Laws; N√ºrnberg Rally). The city was severely damaged during World War II. It was captured by U.S. troops and was the scene of the N√ºrnberg trials, the Allied trials of German war criminals. After World War II much of the city was redeveloped.

The inner city, divided into two parts by the Pegnitz, is encircled by a wall completed in 1452, and the older, inner line of fortifications, dating from 1140 and 1320, can still be traced. Only a few historic buildings survived the massive bomb damage wrought toward the end of World War II, although some have been restored. 

The most important are the Gothic churches of St. Sebald and St. Lorenz and, adjoining the marketplace, the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady). The Heilig Geist Spital (Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost), rising above the Pegnitz, is now a home for the elderly. In addition, there are the Mauthalle (customs house) on the K√∂nigstrasse, the Weinstadel (wine storage house), the Renaissance city hall, the Sch√∂ne Brunnen (a fountain), the Fembohaus (museum of the old city), and, towering above them all, the imperial castle (which now includes a museum on the castle‚Äôs history) and its stables and granary, now a youth hostel.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/loqm2y/cobblestone_street_in_nuremberg_germany/go7afid/,filosoful,1613888224

The US is a great place for people who are willing to work 60+ hours per month as employees or start their own business. There's more money to be made for those who are willing to go above and beyond. It's not a bad place for the middle class either, but many Western Europeans wouldn't see it as an upgrade.

The most dangerous threat the British posed to the Chinese were its disruptions to its shipping, due to the British navy's dominance of the ocean.

If you must know the British blasphemy laws were acted upon until very nearly infact one of the last cases was in 2005 when a court case about blasphemy against the BBC was dropped based on a technicality. Not because blasphemy was not considered as law but because it did not apply to that particular accusation. That is long after the UK joined the EU and yet it was never considered against EU policies, so I somewhat doubt that the EU specifically banned the policy. Infact it was only removed because of a consensus in the British government. They did not remove it due to EU policy at all.

&gt;Very easily, huh? Tell me, how shall Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Dame JK Rowling be summoned to bear arms for the Queen?

HA! But that's what Christians are most known for: cherry-picking. It's not possible to construct a coherent worldview, let alone ethic, if you take the whole thing literally and simultaneously. The Bible contradicts itself in the first couple of chapters!

Genesis I:

1. God created plants.  
2. God created animals. 
3. God created humans.  

 Genesis II:

1. God created man  
2. God created the Garden of Eden and other plants. 
3. God created animals. 
4. God created woman.   

Well, which is it, oh LORD?[I could be here all day](http://contradictionsinthebible.com/). You *have* to pick and choose.

&gt; You have so far not answered the question and continued to deflect an answer. 

[Here's your answer.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative))

&gt;  You support the deplatforming of ""Nazis"" but considering leftists like  you consider anyone that doesn't agree with them from a right wing  perspective a nazi it's not so hard to understand what you are really  trying to say. 

There's certainly Leftists that think anyone not in their particular narrow branch is a Fascist, just like there's Christians who think anyone who doesn't agree with their interpretation is a pagan heretic destined for Hell.

&gt;Once I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump.  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt do it!‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòNobody loves me.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòGod loves you. Do you believe in God?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòAre you a Christian or a Jew?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòA Christian.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòMe, too! Protestant or Catholic?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòProtestant.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòMe, too! What franchise?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòBaptist.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòMe, too! Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòNorthern Baptist.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòMe, too! Northern Conservative Baptist or Northern Liberal Baptist?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòNorthern Conservative Baptist.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòMe, too! Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region,  or Northern Conservative Baptist Eastern Region?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòNorthern  Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòMe, too! Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region  Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region  Council of 1912?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòNorthern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes  Region Council of 1912.‚Äô  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ‚ÄòDie, heretic!‚Äô And I pushed him over. 

But you don't know what kind of Leftist I am, let alone if I'm *that* kind.

&gt; But let me ask you this, would you support the deplatforming of  Christians that actively and publicaly call homosexuality immoral and  homosexuals as sinners and wanting them to go to conversion therapy,  while at the same time supporting traditional Patriarchal nuclear  families? 

**Yup.** The second part is fine, for whoever likes to live that way. You want to be a TradWife? Be my guest! It's the first part that is actively harmful, as well as utterly counterproductive nonsense, and, overall, a scam. That's not opinion, that's empirical, well-documented fact. Gay conversion therapy is torture, plain and simple.

&gt;You likely don't want them to exist though, so there's an interesting thought for you to ponder. 

The armchair telepath strikes again! By al means, keep telling me what I do or do not want.

&gt; I don't know what you think is going on here, but no-one in the Polish  government is arguing whether you deserve to exist or not. No-one. At  most some may consider your behavior sinful and wish for you to change  your ways but that certainly doesn't mean that they don't want you to  exist. 

Oh, yeah, you just want me to live my life pretending I'm someone I'm not, living a lie.

&gt; I don't think you understand what fascism is do you? You do know there  is a fascist manifesto you can read before saying this type of stuff  right? Because nowhere in it does it say anything about exterminating  those that are subhuman. Nowhere. 

Oh, that's adorable. You give Fascists the benefit of the doubt. Fine, fine, let me be more specific, then: Nazis, Neo-Nazis, and White Supermacists, as well as their allies and ideological heirs.

588,"&gt;Hitler started bombing London after the RAF bombed Berlin in 1940

That simply isn't true. Croydon was bombed on 15 August, Wimbledon on the 16th. From the British war cabinet briefing, 22 August:

&gt;Of these, 173 were killed, 179 seriously and 268 slightly injured in daylight raids on Croydon, South-West London and Northfleet on the 15th and 16th August.

And from the 29 August briefing:

&gt;The London district was raided during several nights of the current week, but the attacks appear to have been aimless and only on the night of the 24th-25th August was any serious damage caused.

and

&gt;By night there has been increased activity.  Considerable forces of enemy aircraft operating in small numbers or singly have carried out widespread attacks, apparently aimed mainly at industry and communications. The London and Birmingham areas have been consistently visited.

and 

&gt;During the week 10 people have been killed and 66 seriously injured in London, and 33 killed and 101 seriously injured in Birmingham.

London was bombed multiple times before the first RAF raid on Berlin.",,/r/europe/comments/lo2cvh/kassel_germany_in_1775/go6bxsb/,WhiteSatanicMills,1613867710

Granted, there was one major reform that had to be handled through violence (abolishing slavery), but that was an exceptional episode in American history. Generally, democracy allows for big reforms to be achieved over time through dedicated advocacy, which can eventually win the support of the majority of the population.

Like an hour away from Vienna is Bratislava that had a bunch of that-looking buildings and brown zones turned into a whole new part of the city that will be pleasant to hang around it and is not a nail into your eyes at least for the foreseeable future.   


I am also sure that the newer development of Vienna is just as nice. This is just a bad part with a building that I think 80% of people would agree to look like a provincial town in southern Poland (no disrespect to Poland, could be middle-sized city in Slovakia or Romania as well) with a skyscraper for the extra flavour.",,/r/europe/comments/loblr8/vienna_mornings/go5wabk/,EEuroman,1613859273

Bodily autonomy out ranks right to life. That's not my opinion, nor something I've come up with on own. It is an undeniable fact. Proof? You literally need to sign legal documents in order to give up your bodily autonomy, even after you've died.

Bodily autonomy is held so highly above right to life you can't even harvest a dead person unless they explicitly gave written consent while alive.

Having sex does not strip you of bodily autonomy. If the mother does not consent, she is within her rights to terminate the pregnancy.

697,"*I don‚Äôt mean US equivalence - the UK already has that.*

I realise that was what you meant - I was just curious , out of interest, as to whether that equivalence with the US was through the ‚ÄòUK in the EU‚Äô and therefore will have to be renegotiated - I realise that we may have just rolled over our agreements but I can‚Äôt for the life of me find out what‚Äôs happened with the U.K./US version of this. 

*The earlier poster was referring to the EU‚Äôs refusal to rule over UK equivalence.*

The earlier poster didn‚Äôt mention it. The article, unless I missed it, doesn‚Äôt mention it either. The question is whether them acting for their own benefit after saying that was exactly what they were going to do is somehow unreasonable. But the poster didn‚Äôt mention that either though another did, I think. The poster said something about us not worrying because we would be ‚Äòderegulating from EU protectionism‚Äô and that‚Äôs seems difficult to translate meaningfully in this context. I can‚Äôt see how even if they mean protectionism in as much as not having negotiated equivalence with us (yet) , how deregulation is likely to overcome that - I could easily be wrong but seems like you need a market not just deregulation and also deregulation would mean less equivalence agreements presumably? 

*and force businesses to move to the bloc (though a lot of it is shifting to NY instead - who already have equivalence).*

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised, and if they have ,as they seem to, the negotiating power to do that, why shouldn‚Äôt they? Why should they be looking out for a competitor? This my point that maybe the US has more power in negotiations than we do. 

*It‚Äôs a way to damage the UK over Brexit and potentially a way to pull jobs from London.*

There‚Äôs the rub. I think you make a good point ( though you are a better person than me if you get it from the other posters comment) But I am nit convinced that the two statements are equally obvious. 

*and potentially a way to pull jobs from London.*

Yes and why wouldn‚Äôt they?

*It‚Äôs a way to damage the UK over Brexit*

Well that‚Äôs the opinion. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs possibly simply treating us as a competitor who isn‚Äôt an equal. Did we worry about ... idk French fishermen when renegotiating fishing rights or did we try to get the best deal. If they won‚Äôt rush to give us equivalence it‚Äôs because they have the upper hand - welcome to the cold world outside the club. It seems just a little whiny to say ‚Äòthey are being mean to us‚Äô especially after the years of blaming them for stuff and being told that we were so important to them that they would bend over backwards to give us a great deal. Feels like people are now making excuses like ‚Äòit wasn‚Äôt that we were wrong when we said we held the cards, it‚Äôs just that they are being mean to us‚Äô.

By definition, the UK is more than in-line with the EU‚Äôs rules, but this time the regulator is requesting far more information than is the norm and generally delaying every step of the decision. The EU‚Äôs aim is to try to ‚Äúregulate inwards‚Äù and force businesses to move to the bloc (though a lot of it is shifting to NY instead - who already have equivalence).

2. The Catholic position on homosexuality is that they should repent. It's not that they should accept themselves as homosexuals. Because yes Catholicism supports forgiveness but while you may not hate someone for being homosexual that doesn't mean you don't believe his/her behavior is immoral. And by painting this rainbow they are mocking and disrespecting Christian beliefs.

3. Like my previous comment reiterates Christianity doesn't advocate for the death of homosexuals. And certainly people may make jokes about them but there's nothing wrong with that, in some places in western Europe you can be jailed for even joking about homosexuals. Is that what you want? And certainly there are some people that are more extreme on the topic but they don't represent the majority like you claim they do

4. Hate speech laws my friend target any and all socially traditionalist views. That means the people that oppose homosexuality even for religious reasons can be jailed. Is that what you want?

And you'd have a nice search engine and post with links to ""best threads about potatoes"" or whatever the subject was, so you could find good content more easily.

Reddit is more, people post the same link 20 times, there is a lot of repetition. Comments are 5 words or 5 lines, but you don't see many half-a-page comments in a row on a thread, which was normal for the forums.

This is the danger of misinformation, I've seen people on this sub flatout lie and claim that the above statement is not true (getting a ton of up votes). 

I don't think it's a coincidence that the frequency of these issues (people not turning up to appointments, health officials refusing to take the vaccine and vaccines being wasted) seem to be exclusive to mainland Europe where officials have gone on record making factually inaccurate claims (all of which seemed to take place in the days surrounding the dispute between AZ and the EC, however have gone quiet since). 

What I don't understand is how the UK have vaccinated ~17m people, including all frontline workers (NHS and care home staff) and yet it didn't seem to have these same issues and considering the high rates of people in hospital (thankfully now falling) you would have thought it would be really prominent.",,/r/europe/comments/lo6lu4/healthworker_unions_in_europe_say_thousands_of/go532lz/,TrickyContribution72,1613844413

945,"The USA can dialogue with the entirety of the EU if it has interests regarding that, if however it only wishes to tear it apart or take over way more control than it should have over a single country, like it has done in the past both in Italy and in other examples in Europe, it should be told that we are not willing to play their game any more. 

Because of the EU, we already stand a much smaller risk of facing everything that Europe went through the last time that the USA had their nemesis for world domination. The USA might be ""much less aggressive"" this time around simply because of this; had we still been woefully divided we would be at the mercy of their divide and conquer approach that made Europe a mess during the Cold War. We have seen that there is no lack of trying to do this from America once again, with the huge support for anti-EU and far right movements, especially on the economic side, coming from American groups and people.

If the UK is willing to side with the USA on anything and everything it's their choice, but it is dictated by the fact that they decided to lose some of the options that they had. Italy however has not decided to do so, and I hope it never will. We have had enough reduced democracy and sovereignty for decades, we shouldn't go back to that.

&gt;Ok, but the EU simply dosen't have the capabilities and resources to be completely autonomous, even in a two polar system, it will have to choose one of the poles.

From 7th century until 11th century the Byzantine Empire and Bulgarian Empire controlled the place. In the 11th century the Grand Principality of Serbia conquered the area and held it until 1439, when it was conquered by the Ottomans. The Ottomans had the area under control until 1913 when it was given to Serbia by the treaty of London. Then Serbia had the area under control from 1913 to 1999. 

So if my math is correct the Serbs controlled Kosovo from 1092 until 1439, that's 347 years, and then from 1913 until 1999, that another 86 years. 347 + 86 = 433 years. Where are your 700+ years?

By your logic if we consider the Italians to be descendants of the Romans or the Greeks of the Byzantines, since they controlled the area way longer than Serbs and therefor have the rights to own it.

North Korea is the nutter we need to be worry about but China would level them instantly, so no need to retaliate for that (UK and USA would likely also lob a few in).

It just sounds weird to me how you do that. You consider Islam - which has next to no political power or influence in Europe - to be a bigger current threat than Christianity, which still holds significant political power in Europe. I think it's best symbolized by a sentence you wrote:

&gt; Of course it is still subtly there (in Italy we still have crucifixes in classrooms) but I do not feel it is something people feel so relevant to their lives (no one look at those crucifixes anymore).

Religious symbols in places that ought to be highly secular aren't an issue, it's just so normalized, but people who have ""bad views"" - even though they have no political power - are worse? Or that a theocracy in Europe isn't an issue, but said powerless minority is? After all according to your own words the scope is Europe.

1266,"I appreciate you making a counterargument to point out weaknesses in my line of reasoning. I will do my best to engage it and improve my opinions, please don't understand this as an attack, I enjoy discussing these things immensely.

Colonization and Imperialism may have benefited Lords, Landowners and the most successful merchants, but your average farmer or worker saw nothing of this wealth up until the 20th century. I wouldn't call that progress, if anything it was old feudal institutions trying to find their place in a new capitalist order. Sure, you can call the Spanish Empire with all its fresh gold that it stole from the new world wealthy and influential, but this is anything but progress, its just the same old monarchies abusing their newfound economic and technological advantages for the same old ends they have been striving for since the end of the roman empire. A Spanish farmer saw nothing of this ""progress"", except that if he was unlucky he was sent to die in some far-off war.

Don't get me wrong, Colonialism was horrible, but its even more tragic once you realize how pointless it was as well. Look at Germany as an example, from 1800 to 1900: no colonies, no influence anywhere but in the centre of Europe, then, through the largest scale industrialization in the world up to that point -&gt; massive increases in living standards and education for the average person. What resources did it need from colonies to do this? It had all the coal and iron ore it needed right within its own borders. 

But now what happens in Germany, with its newfound economic strength? Well, the old power-holders worry about losing their status and cling to the influence, they still have, with all their desperation, resulting in that Hohenzollern piece of shit rejecting the ""gutter crown"" in 1848, ending all possibility for Germany to turn into a more democratic  constitutional monarchy akin to Britain. Worse yet, Prussia goes on to lead a series of bloody wars to form an authoritarian German empire. All along internally fighting the early social democrats (the people that actually cared for your average person) and basing their internal political power heavily on the Junkers (large landowners, descendant from feudal lords, that didn't care about the average person). It was those leftover medieval lords that pushed for more war and acquiring colonies. They were even instrumental in preparing the stage for the shitshow that was the first and second world war.

Germany would have been more than fine federalizing in 1850 and keeping to itself to improve the lives of Germans. They wouldn't have needed a single colony to do so, because in real live it didn't. But the big problem with this what-if is, that those landowners would have lost all political influence and would have probably also lost their estates and their nobility or whatever. The reason our timeline turned out the way it did, was because these shitheads weren't letting that happen.

And this is a pattern all across Europe. The colonies were a way for old nobility to leverage the only thing they knew how to do, to keep their status. If you think about it a colony is amazingly tedious if all you want to do is buy spices and chinaware to sell back home. They could have done that perfectly well by just trading. With the exception to state monopolies, the prices would have been barely higher. If anything, by trading freely they could have even increased the local wealth and output, leading to lower prices. The only reason to not do this is if you are a shithead noble, that needs money and wants to take control of that state monopoly for your own personal gain, that way you don't have to compete with those other traders on the market.",Baden-W√ºrttemberg (Germany),/r/europe/comments/lmjcgs/china_the_cake_of_kingsand_of_emperors_french/go3vdvq/,Brakasus,1613815748

""By far, the largest drawback of the EURO is a single¬†monetary policy¬†that often does not fit local economic conditions. It is common for parts of the EU to be prospering, with high growth and low unemployment. In contrast, others suffer from prolonged economic downturns and high unemployment.

The classic¬†Keynesian¬†solutions for these problems are entirely different. The high growth country ought to have high interest rates to prevent inflation, overheating, and an eventual economic crash. The low growth country should lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing. In theory, countries with high unemployment do not need to worry much about inflation because of the availability of the unemployed to produce more goods. **Unfortunately, interest rates cannot be simultaneously raised in the high growth country and lowered in the low growth country when they have a single currency like the EURO.**

In fact, the euro caused precisely the opposite of standard economic policy to be implemented during the¬†European sovereign debt crisis. As growth slowed and unemployment increased in countries like Italy and Greece, investors feared for their solvency, driving up interest rates. Typically, there would be no solvency fears for governments under a fiat money regime because the national government could order the central bank to print more money.

However, the European Central Bank's independence meant printing money was not an option for eurozone governments. Higher interest rates increased unemployment and even caused¬†deflation and negative economic growth in some countries. It would be fair to say that the euro contributed to an economic¬†depression¬†in Greece.""

You'd be basically forfeiting any control of national monetary policy for the 'privilege' of being more attractive to foreign investments. Sounds ok on paper, to some extent...but in reality capitalism can be unstable and is definitely proned to bubbles which lead to crises.

 [""What we‚Äôre basically looking at¬†... is a balance of payments problem, in which capital flooded south after the creation of the EURO, leading to overvaluation in southern Europe.¬†In truth, this has never been a fiscal crisis at its root; it has always been a balance of payments crisis that manifests itself in part in budget problems, which have then been pushed onto the center of the stage by ideology.""](https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/european-crisis-realities/)",Romania,/r/europe/comments/lngew6/romania_aims_to_adopt_euro_in_20272028_enter/go3h8g1/,Pictoru,1613802866

The EU might accidentally get people hurt or killed if they continue to initiate illegal building where there are minefields near the borders or by urging people to go on weapons testing grounds unbeknownst to israeli authorities.

* It's confident, assertive and aggressive.

* It doesn't value truth as an end, but only as a means that can be buried, excavated, shifted or even entirely invalidated so long as it's in service of its purposes.

* It uses public shaming, bullying and segregation as a means to enforce its worldview.

* It looks down on thinking and uses emotion to short circuit it.

* It looks down on the rule of law, when it acknowledges it at all.

What? It still does. I just pointed at Poland as that is the easiest example. Yet you can also point to other countries. Since I'm German and know most about that, I'll take it as a reference:

Germany still has religious laws on the book, restricting certain behaviors for religious reasons. Religious classes (usually either Catholic or Protestant, seldom Islamic) or Ethics as an alternative are mandatory. Our biggest party is called ""Christian Democratic Union"" and takes faith seriously. Shops are closed on Sundays (not for labor laws or such, but primarily still based on religious custom). And so on.

Besides that look at gay marriage - in most European countries it was only accepted recently due to opposition of religious groups and people. Several count 

You could point to dozens of things that are still influenced by Christianity. Including the fact that we still have a Christian theocracy in Europe. Looking at America it's even worse.

Some of them were completely physically produced at one place (like the Mastcam-Z was fully made in the USA), but all of these sensors were first created at a smaller scale to see if they truly work and then analysed and improved, and similar experiments were done; those experiments did not only happen in the USA and indeed were collaborated for.

Turkey, Zimbabwe should annex lands or should take over places via occupation and colonisation, be my guest. Or if you can see me saying US was righteous to genocide people and colonise the land, and that's a good equivalent for Russia tbf, no?

Yet, it was also on the newly independent Georgia's govt that it failed to solve the issue, and sustain the union. Things could have been solved, but it went into them gaining their quasi-independence and actively being occupied by Russia which they're not found of. Only way to reverse it is to recognise them, have a peace deal that manages to back-off Russia from Abkhazia and manage to return refugees to their houses by giving assurance that Georgia won't be trying to annex them.

2064,"&gt; One of the main sticking points for people voting for Scottish inde' was that they would have to leave the EU. 

It was not even in the Top 5 priorities in terms of why people voted NO. 

It's also incredibly churlish of SNP nitwits to claim that Scots thought they were guaranteed to stay in the EU if they voted to stay part of the UK. David Cameron had made a speech the year before promising an EU referendum, the Liberal Democrats had put a vote on the EU in their manifesto. 

Both parties in power at the time had pledged to hold a vote on the UK's membership. Anyone who claims that Scotland had no idea it  might lose EU membership by voting to remain part of the UK is either a) ignorant or b) lying. There's not excuse for either. 

It's deeply hypocritical how the SNP are insisting that there must be an new referendum because Scotland is not longer in the EU, when only 6 years ago they were actively campaigning to leave the EU by virtue of leaving the UK.

Please read my comment carefully. I never said their flag was discontinued, rather not used, and ""no longer their flag"", as now used by the EU. Hence why you won't find the EU flag on any of their properties, but rather their new one. The one they have been using for decades.

You also haven't explained why flying the EU flag, but pretending it's the 70 year old COE flag, not been used by them for decades, is a legitimate and honest argument.

&gt;"" Yet again, where did you get this? I'm sure there are plenty of places where the flag of NATO is flown. I don't see why flying flag of the Council of Europe(A transnational organisation of which UK is also a member of) would be any more controversial. ""

I may have misspoke with this point. It's more of a Gov guideline rather than law.

2215,"&gt; The Visegr√°d Group is facing a stark choice: it can either become a dead monument, or a model of regional cooperation within Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; This is how Czech president V√°clav Havel saw the future of this regional union (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) 10 years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; The V4 just turned 30 years old, but there is not much to celebrate.
&gt; 
&gt; In particular when considering the group's selfish approach to addressing the migration crisis or Hungary and Poland's threat of vetoing the EU budget, afraid of seeing their compliance with the rule-of-law principles monitored.
&gt; 
&gt; The deteriorating state of democracy is evidenced by a gradual financial and regulatory marginalisation of independent media, most recently of Klub R√°di√≥ in Hungary, the curtailment of the judiciary's independence in Poland, and the worsening public perception of corruption in Slovakia.
&gt; 
&gt; It was in Poland that Havel spoke in 1990 of the region's unique opportunity to become an additional pillar of democracy and freedom in a reunified Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; Together with the founding fathers J√≥zsef Antall and Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, he dreamed of the region developing not only a strong economy but, above all, democratic and decentralised institutions and a self-confident civil society.
&gt; 
&gt; Havel hoped that the region, with its 40-year experience of communism, could play a major and audacious role in the future of a never-changing Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; Important social and political developments are already taking place in the Eastern neighbourhood of the EU. For more than six months, we have witnessed the courage of Belarusian civil society demanding democratic elections.
&gt; 
&gt; President Alexander Lukashenko's repressive regime has already arrested more than 30,000 people and, to stay in power, is building new detention-style camps.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, Russians seem to be losing patience with a similar regime in their country. The democratic world is calling for the release of Alexei Navalny, the leading critic of president Vladimir Putin.
&gt; 
&gt; It is clear that the attempt at Navalny's physical liquidation and his current imprisonment are the result of his persistent accusations of rampant corruption and stifling bureaucracy within Putin's regime, while the country's standard of living is plunging ever deeper.
&gt; 
&gt; While in August of last year the V4 presidents appropriately responded to the protests in Belarus through a joint statement, this time they failed to acknowledge the tense situation in Russia and the call for a common EU position.
&gt; 
&gt; Their meeting this week on the Polish Hel Peninsula was devoted solely to the pandemic and the recovery of national economies.
&gt; 
&gt; But it is national governments that have the full competence to address the impact of the pandemic scourging the region.
&gt; Silence on Russia
&gt; 
&gt; The competence of presidential offices, which are largely representational, resides in the power of words. Their joint communiqu√© thus missed out on the chance to send a signal that they were indeed taking notice of the events in their eastern neighbourhood, and that they were taking the side of the brutally repressed Russian civil society.
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that the V4 presidents did not comment on Russia comes as a disappointment, but not as a surprise.
&gt; 
&gt; The Visegr√°d Group is more divided than united by the challenges facing Europe. It is true that all V4 countries have thus far voted to extend the sanctions imposed on Russia for annexing Crimea, and their troops are deployed in the Baltic region as part of a Nato mission.
&gt; 
&gt; This, however, does not mean that the V4 has a unified stance vis-√†-vis the Kremlin. Poland is traditionally highly-critical, in the Czech Republic president Milo≈° Zeman is conspicuously soft on Putin, and so is Hungary.
&gt; 
&gt; Following presidential and parliamentary elections, Slovakia has embraced a value-based, principled attitude to Moscow again.
&gt; 
&gt; The adoption of a common V4 action can hardly be expected at the forthcoming EU summit which is likely to consider further sanctions against Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; The construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline which many central and east Europeans and the US are demanding to be ended, is also a divisive issue for the V4.
&gt; 
&gt; Its completion would bypass the V4 region and cause economic and geopolitical damage. It is not only about plummeting revenues from gas transit fees to western Europe; it is also about the general ""geopolitical rent"" for the central European region, which would shrink proportionately to the diminishing importance of current gas pipelines.
&gt; 
&gt; But the only vocal critic of the construction of Nord Stream 2 among the V4 countries is Poland.
&gt; 
&gt; Slovakia is diffident; the Czech Republic pretends this issue is not relevant, while Hungary maintains privileged relations with Russia. This applies primarily to the gas and atomic energy sectors where the giant MOL cooperates with Gazprom.
&gt; 
&gt; All this seems to suggest, on the one hand, that the V4 has achieved its main purpose ‚Äì to integrate the countries into the Euro-Atlantic structures.
&gt; 
&gt; It is obvious that close regional cooperation has contributed to calming relations between Hungary and Slovakia and implementing a number of regional projects, especially in the field of infrastructure, as well as in the joint fields of cultural and people-to-people cooperation.
&gt; 
&gt; But at the same time, it is a fact that with its stance on immigration and adherence to democratic standards, the V4 has positioned itself as a kind of 'enfant terrible' in the midst of Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; Notwithstanding their current reputation, the V4 countries should not give up on close cooperation.
&gt; 
&gt; They constitute a natural regional entity with a common history and a common cultural and political heritage.
&gt; 
&gt; Those who incite individual governments to distance themselves from the Visegr√°d Group in favour of forming alliances with the 'big players' inside and outside the EU are wrong. This would amount to misunderstanding the importance and necessity of regional cooperation.
&gt; 
&gt; How can we urge the countries of the Western Balkans to garner the courage for effective regional cooperation if we ourselves ‚Äì as full members of the Euro-Atlantic alliance ‚Äì fail to serve as an example?
&gt; 
&gt; Neighbours have always been and always will be important. Regional stability is the pillar of global stability. After all, governments come and go. But the countries and the regions are here to stay.",,/r/europe/comments/lngc9n/the_visegr√°d_dream_deteriorates/go07wj8/,mulgrave2,1613742909

2245,"&gt;And maybe that's surprise for you, but colonisation is not something ""Russians moving within their country"" especially when a significant amount of them were literal settlers put there. Sorry. I'm also not sure about punishment in here - saying Russians don't have a right to annex a land or carve out a country for themselves via a process including genocides and colonisation is a punishment now. /s

Settler is a subjective term. People moving within their own country is objective - it's the literal truth. And arguing that Russians do not deserve rights within Crimea because of the deportation of the Crimean is an obvious example of collective punishment.

&gt;I'm also so anti-Georgian that I'm ethnic Georgian with Adjaran subgroup myself. /s Really, stop already. What happened in Abkhazia wasn't justified if you're talking about ethnic cleansing.

So on the one hand you agree that Abkhazia has the right to be independent but on the other hand you also agree that the Georgian refugees have the right to return to Abkhazia, which would mean the end of Abkhazian independence? How exactly can you reconcile these two positions?

&gt;What happened in Bulgaria wasn't also justified meaning many ethnic cleansings, would you like to return to Turkey's rule? 

No, you're the one who thinks that present day peoples should be punished for past crimes. On top of that, your bias prevents you from seeing that if this were so, it would be definitely Turkey and not Bulgaria that should be punished.

&gt;Same goes for ethnic cleansing of Germans. 

So you believe that Germany has the right to take back the land despite the wish of the current inhabitants?

&gt;I find the justification of colonisation abhorrent as well as right for former coloniser to rule over as well. If you're so into that, you can start it with your own country though?

No,you don't. You don't see anything abhorrent about colonial countries who you like, for example Turkey or for that matter the United States. And unlike you, I have consistent principles - I believe that the actual inhabitants should have more right than people who've lived there outside living memory. And adding arbitrary buzzwords like ""colonisers"" and ""settlers"" does not make your position more legitimate or just.

**Nicola Sturgeon orders EU flag to be flown from Scottish government buildings daily**

&amp;#x200B;

Opponents of First Minister say demand showed her 'obsession' with constitutional issues and 'makes no sense' in light of Brexit

*By Daniel Sanderson, Scottish Correspondent 18 February 2021 ‚Ä¢ 8:23pm*

&amp;#x200B;

Nicola Sturgeon has ordered that the EU flag is flown from Scottish government buildings every day, despite Britain no longer being a member of the bloc.

&amp;#x200B;

Opponents of the First Minister said the demand showed her ""obsession"" with constitutional issues and ""makes no sense"" in light of Brexit.

&amp;#x200B;

The request was included in updated official guidance over which flags should be flown from buildings run by the Scottish government and its agencies.

&amp;#x200B;

While the Union Jack is to be flown on only one day a year ‚ÄìRemembrance Day ‚Äì Ms Sturgeon ""instructed that the European flag is flown from Scottish government buildings on a daily basis except for specific flag flying dates"", the guidance says.

&amp;#x200B;

Dean Lockhart, the constitution spokesman for the Scottish Tories, said: ""The UK has left the EU, so Nicola Sturgeon's personal decision to order the flying of the EU flag on Scottish government buildings makes no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

""It reconfirms the SNP's refusal to accept referendum results and their ongoing focus on constitutional issues at the expense of more important priorities. But we should not be surprised. Like all nationalists, Sturgeon is obsessed with flags.""

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, the SNP narrowly won a vote to keep the EU flag flying outside the Scottish parliament despite fears that the move compromised the neutrality of the parliamentary estate.

&amp;#x200B;

A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The EU flag is flown to reflect the overwhelming vote of the people of Scotland to remain in Europe, and as a mark of solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of EU citizens who continue to call Scotland home despite Brexit.""

&amp;#x200B;

2362,"&gt; A Brit earning GBP 30k will pay around GBP 3,200 in income tax a year - so maybe our hypothetical German will pay their GBP 20,000 subsidy in a say 20/30 years (if they stay here). 

30k are quite low though (for a university graduate). It obviously depends on the area, but 60k should be more realistic in my opinion. Thus 10/15 years which sounds a lot better.

&gt; However, the chances of them staying here and not returning to Germany is tiny 

You do have ~5.5% of the UK population as European migrants though. And abviously not all of them studied in the UK but i am sure quite a few did.

I on the other hand only know people that studied in the UK and stayed there (not too many though).

Your initial statement was in my opinion quite short-sighted. You might be correct, but it is a lot more complex (and essentially ""unprovable"") than your statement suggested.

Lately people tend to oversimplify things and ignore important facts - which is quite dangerous in my opinion.

2445,"Historically I point to the fact that China is no imperialist country, your argument is basically ""but maybe they become imperialist"". ""you should actively influence the world you live in, someone else will otherwise"". That shows clearly that you are also thinking like an imperialist...If you dont dictate the world someone will do it. That is so wrong, and basically justifies every violent conquest.

Nuclear weapons do not prevent wars between superpowers at all. There were countless proxy wars between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the cold war. China was never involved in a proxy war. That is a good thing.

What I see in China, is a country which became an economic superpower especially without conquering other countries, dictating them how to live or how to think. Is that not remarkable? Take Africa as an example, there are countless examples where western nations invaded countries, extracted all resources, abducted people, often without developing the countries. China did not behave like that....They do not orchestrate coups there to install chinese friendly leaders to extract resources like for example the U.S. still does in Latin America. If the Chinese want resources, they just pay for them. In many examples they even develop the countries infrastructure as an exchange. Is that not a better approach?

I never said that China is a threat to its neighbors. (you can argue that superpowers are always threatening of course) but that it did one invasion of a neighbor country (1950). Nazi Germany was a threat to its neighbors as it had clear ambitions to conquer Europe. I see no such ambitions neither for China nor for Russia.

However about your argument that adversity makes people strive for more. I mean, sure, I guess? But this is based on a whole lot of ""IFs"". 

IF the parents indeed grow to love him.

IF the financial strain and having to raise a child isn't too much on the marriage

IF the child rises through adversity instead of being crushed under it

IF the child rises to a life a decency and wellbeing, not crime and continuing the poverty circle

IF the child doesn't develop any kind of mental issues through a hardened childhood  
IF IF IF... that's the issue. 

By making sure that whatever basic needs (such a financial stability, actually wanting and being able to raise a child for example) are met before a child is brought into this world, we give the child A LOT better chances of becoming happy and successful.

Any child would be better off if they were raised by parents who wanted them, who were financially stable and who are actually capable of raising them. I've worked with children in a poorer area of my city, councelling them and parents. And trust me, I see a shitton of cases there where the lives of the parents would be better if they child hadn't been born and the child wouldn't have to be with shitty parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

And if you say that every kid you know that came from a poor background grew up to be more successful, I dare guess you're being rather picky. By your logic all poor people should disappear from the face of the planet because heck, that darn adversity made them all so rich, smart and powerful.

&gt;There is no right to free slander. Its called free speech. We have laws that define slander, and i hope they are clear enough, that the penalty is a monetary issue.

Are you seriously claiming that libel/slander is no speech? 
If I understand your idea, you seem to think that speech which has defined legal consequences is no longer speech? 
Perjury? Ordering subordinates to commit a war-crime? Black-mailing? Producing certain pornography? Leaking state secrets? Asking a hitman to assassinate someone? Yelling ""Fire"" in a crowded theatre to cause panic? 
If I follow your logic none of those things is speech because all are defined by law as behaviour that can be punished.      

I am amazed how efficiently you solved the free speech problems that exist by claiming that only legal speech is free speech.       
 Kudos for this legal analysis of the century. 


&gt;Here in Europe some seem unable to make some definitions and defend them in court of what slander and free spech is.

You do know that most European Union states have laws that define quite specific what slander is too?         
However we also have laws about perjury, inciting a genocide, black-mail, denying the shoa.       
So, since only defined things are punishable we should have, according to your logic, still freedom of speech, just no freedom to incite a genocide.    

   
 I don't think however that neither the US not Europe has solved those issues.

2543,"Neither a public application nor any other formal selection procedure preceded the nomination of Zolt√°n Csehi as the country‚Äôs new member of the European Court of Justice by Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga.

According to Telex sources, Csehi had been a lawyer in the law firm of Varga‚Äôs predecessor until 2016 and had little experience in European law prior to being appointed to the European General Court that same year.

Telex has asked the justice ministry for comments but has not received a reply by the time of publication.

On Monday, Atv.hu wrote that Varga would nominate Zolt√°n Csehi, currently a judge at the EU‚Äôs first instance court, as the Hungarian member of the top court, ECJ, for a six-year term on behalf of the government. The nomination is subject to approval by a vetting panel.

Government sources told Telex that Varga had made a unilateral decision on Csehi‚Äôs nomination, who was formally heard by the parliamentary committee on European affairs on Monday, but according to the parliamentary website and witness reports, his suitability was not examined on his merits.

Born in 1965, Csehi was also a lawyer in the law firm of former justice minister and current MEP L√°szl√≥ Tr√≥cs√°nyi before being appointed to the General Court in 2016. This is not mentioned in his biography available on the Court‚Äôs website.

Tr√≥cs√°nyi was Hungary‚Äôs first pick for Commissioner in Ursula von der Leyen‚Äôs Commission in 2019, but his candidacy was rejected by the European Parliament‚Äôs legal committee due to ‚Äúconflict of interest,‚Äù forcing Budapest to instead nominate the current Hungarian Commissioner, Oliv√©r V√°rhelyi.

Did you want the UK government to spend the same amount on vaccines for other countries as they have on vaccines for the UK? 4% is a huge proportion fo the budget to spend on helping other countries. 

A large proportion of the ""inward-focussed"" vaccine spend went on actually developing the vaccines, securing the doses which we will now be donating the surplus and fubding trial - all benefit every country in the long-term. Ankther huge proportion of the budget l was setting up the infrastructure to manufacture the vaccines, again something that will help all countries in the long-term.

I am suggesting we do not need to treat other societies as a threat to us; this is a western viewpoint because the West sees all other societies as occupying land over resources we could extract, and it is a 'threat' if those distant populations are not in the mood to sell those resources, and their country's labour, for less than market prices.

The militarism is necessary to cheapen the world. A political economy not committed to  maintaining the cheapness of resources, of labour, of life, would not need such investment.

2743,"&gt;For paywall:

Italian prosecutors have launched an investigation into a ‚Ç¨1.25bn government purchase of PPE from China, saying a group of businessmen were paid tens of millions of euros in illegal commissions to secure the contracts. 

According to prosecutors in Rome, four Italian companies ‚Äî Sunsky, Partecipazioni, Microproducts It and Guernica ‚Äî ‚Äúillicitly served as concealed intermediaries‚Äù between the government and a Chinese consortium for the purchase of personal protective equipment, receiving illegal payments from the Wenzhou-based groups. 

Italy was the first country in Europe to be hit hard by the pandemic, with the death toll exceeding 35,000 during the first wave. The government initially struggled to provide PPE to health workers and there was a two-month long shortage of face masks in stores. 

In March, Italy‚Äôs emergency Covid-19 commissioner‚Äôs office handed three Chinese companies ‚Äî Wenzhou Moon-Ray, Wenzhou Light and Luokai Trade ‚Äî a contract for 800m face masks. 

The tender was awarded because of mediation by the Italian companies‚Äô owners, who received tens of millions of euros from the Chinese companies, according to court documents seen by the Financial Times. Luokai Trade, they showed, had been incorporated in China just five days before the Italian government‚Äôs order was formalised. 

Andrea Vincenzo Tommasi, chief executive of Sunsky; his business partner Daniele Guidi, former chief of San Marino national bank, which is being probed over its bankruptcy; and Mario Benotti, founder of Microproducts It and a former executive at Italy‚Äôs public broadcaster, Rai, are under investigation for money laundering, possession of stolen goods and illicit traffic of influences, prosecutors said on Thursday. 

The monetary unit of the Guardia di Finanza, Italy‚Äôs financial police, seized assets worth more than ‚Ç¨70m, including bank accounts, company stakes, real estate, jewellery and yachts, belonging to eight people under investigation. 

According to court documents seen by the Financial Times, Sunsky, was paid ‚Ç¨59.7m by the Chinese companies for delivering the face masks to Italy. Jorge Solis, a Rome-based Ecuadorean entrepreneur and a friend of Guidi, was paid ‚Ç¨5.8m for putting the Chinese in touch with the Italian intermediaries. 

Benotti, a longtime acquaintance of Domenico Arcuri, Italy‚Äôs emergency commissioner for the pandemic response, was paid ‚Ç¨12m by the Chinese consortium for introducing Solis and Tommasi to the commissioner‚Äôs office, according to the filing. 

The payments were ‚Äúillicit‚Äù because they were based on ‚Äúconcealed commercial mediation activities linked to personal relations with the Covid commissioner [Arcuri]‚Äù, the documents said. 

The public tender did not follow standard procedures, prosecutors said. 

Benotti, through his lawyers, said he acted on a mandate from Arcuri, who was appointed Covid commissioner last March. 

Arcuri, who also heads Invitalia, the national investments agency, and oversaw business crises at national carrier Alitalia and ArcelorMittal‚Äôs Apulian steel plant Ilva, told the press in a statement that ‚Äúhis name had been illegally exploited by the people under investigation‚Äù and he would consider legal action against them. 

The court documents show 1,280 telephone contacts between Arcuri and Benotti between January and May 2020.

Prosecutors said there was no evidence of payments from the commissioner‚Äôs office to any company and therefore they were not investigating any public office for corruption. 

Last month Solis, told Italy‚Äôs La7 television, which first reported on anomalies around the ‚Ç¨1.25bn contract in December, that he had been called by Arcuri‚Äôs aide last year who told him: ‚ÄúI want you to help Italy‚Äù because they knew he regularly did business with the Chinese companies.

According to the court filing, the Bank of Italy‚Äôs anti-money laundering office had already flagged the Chinese companies‚Äô bank transfers to the corporate accounts of Solis, Benotti and Tommasi as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù.",Taiwan,/r/europe/comments/ln6mj3/italy_launches_probe_into_125bn_ppe_contract_with/gnz0q9h/,poclee,1613709035

It's a unique problem because AZ isn't given to the other priority groups (like people over 65) and the number of vaccinated people working in hospitals went up with it, so it created a huge 'sick leave' effect.

Add to that the fears of being less efficient (and thus increase risks of disease) while not having a second chance to get another vaccine and news of mutations and it's quite understandable.

2837,"Thank you for your response. You have presented an interesting point i have not thought about earlier. However, i would disagree that the action od driving is equivalent to procreation. The action of driving a car, for example, has a purpose of safely and quickly transporting people from A to B, which is its both expected and anticipated outcome. Any casulties that may or may not come into effect as results of this acction are i no way connected to its original purpose. When it comes to sexual activity, the purpose is reproduction to produce offspring. The only two ways sexual contact can end in that im aware of are: a) the egg is fertilized, and b): the egg is not fertilized. Theres no other outcome that is not connected to the purpose of the activity. So, when engaging in sexual intercourse, you cant expect anyting more than those two aforementioned results, which is not the case when driving. I would say that when making love, you are willingfully and with full awareness ""putting your bodily autonomy at risk"", for the lack of a better term, because the action you partake in can end only in two different ways, and you are aware of that. For instance, you cannot drop an egg on the floor and not consent for it to break and then demand full refund from the storeowner (im not really sure about this visualisation but i hope you understand what im tring to say).

Sometimes we share the same value, but many of our values and ideals are in opposition. Because of this, the American-European relationship is more of an ""alliance of convenience"", not anything really deeper than that.

2961,"Are you talking about people focusing on the past too much or the government?

I think people in Poland and everywhere for that matter focus more on present and their future rather than the past.

We want to live a good life and we wish the same for our children, but we value our history - our culture and traditions.

After all it's the past, it's our experiences that shape us and shape our future.
And although the past doesn't define us, it certainly influences us.

If you're talking about the government, then it's rather complex issue and I don't really want to dive into it as it's rather pointless in this specific case.

In this case it's just a part of national identity and it's not like wanting them back stops us from living or building.

It's like heirlooms - let's say a neighbor across the street posseses your great-grandmother's jewelry box and photographs that you would like to have, because they possess sentimental value to you or because you want to share them with your family.

You just don't stop going to work, entertain yourself or stop pursuiting your passions because of that, no, you keep living your life as you always do.

But if you don't do anything, if you say nothing, be sure it won't be given back to you anytime soon or never, even.

Our cultural heritage is just that - a heritage. It's a testimony of our history, achievements and culture.
Reading or hearing about something is one thing, but seeing it is something totally different. It's like witnessing history, in a way.
It's a bond that holds us together, but also something that conveys inspiration and ideas to the future generations.

Let's not get crazy over relics. They're not something that need to be kept in check. We just want to enjoy them in our museums, we want all Polish citizens to have an easy access to them, to study the history not only from the textbooks that could be rewritten, but also from those living proofs that something really happened and to know how it did.

3100,"&gt;The BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine appears to be significantly less effective against the virus variant that emerged in South Africa, according to a study published on Wednesday.¬†
&gt;
&gt;The vaccine still works against the strain known as 501Y.V2, but the shot produced only a third of the antibodies that it did for the original virus in a lab study using an engineered virus.¬†
&gt;
&gt;The partners said there was ‚Äúno clinical evidence‚Äù that people vaccinated with their Covid-19 shot lacked protection against the variant. It is hard to draw firm conclusions from lab experiments on how the¬†[vaccines](https://www.ft.com/covid-19-vaccines)¬†will work on the variants in humans.¬†
&gt;
&gt;But they said they were making investments and talking to regulators so they could seek authorisation for an updated vaccine or a booster shot ‚Äúonce a strain that significantly reduces protection from the vaccine is identified‚Äù.¬†
&gt;
&gt;The vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer was the first to receive emergency approval in many countries, including the US and the UK. The pair expect to make up to 2bn doses this year.
&gt;
&gt;[The paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017), published in The New England Journal of Medicine, is based on experiments using the blood of 20 vaccine trial participants. The scientists from Pfizer, BioNTech and the University of Texas Medical Branch tested three different genetically engineered viruses, one with all the mutations of 501Y.V2, and two with subsets of the changes.¬†
&gt;
&gt;[The scientists](https://www.ft.com/content/1feb5358-fbf4-4508-8a11-ba9093a6050a)¬†had¬†[previously found](https://www.ft.com/content/943c8ca9-0c92-4366-8ab4-b569a1e123b8)¬†that the vaccine was likely to be effective against B.1.1.7, which first emerged in the UK.
&gt;
&gt;But many other vaccine makers have found their shots are far less effective against the South African variant. South Africa¬†[halted the rollout](https://www.ft.com/content/82534b15-6f2d-41b9-9947-de674b11079c)¬†of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine after preliminary data showed it failed to protect against mild and moderate forms of Covid-19 caused by the new strain.¬†
&gt;
&gt;In clinical trials with sites in South Africa, both Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax found their vaccines were less effective against the variant. In a lab study,¬†[Moderna](https://www.ft.com/content/c0c8f72c-e58e-4319-80c4-0db153ad85db)¬†found its vaccine only produced one-sixth of the antibodies in response to the 501Y.V2 variant than it did to the original virus.¬†
&gt;
&gt;Some vaccine makers, including Novavax and Moderna, are already preparing for clinical trials of a reformulated vaccine or a booster shot.¬†
&gt;
&gt;BioNTech/Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine ‚Äî like Moderna‚Äôs ‚Äî is based on messengerRNA technology that can be quickly adapted to new variants. The companies said they were evaluating the vaccine against other strains, including one that first emerged in Brazil, and were conducting studies to monitor the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness in the real world.",,/r/europe/comments/lmvjh6/biontechpfizer_vaccine_is_less_potent_against/gnx94gq/,piratemurray,1613677991

IMO the best solution to this is a higher degree of democracy and accountability. In the Soviet-style Marxist-Leninist model of socialism, this was severely lacking. Capitalist economies aren't immune to corruption either, far from it, but what separates corrupt countries from the less corrupt is that in less corrupt countries, there's a much higher level of democracy and participation in politics. If we want to build a successful version of socialism, democracy, true democracy needs to be the number one most important value in our societies.",,/r/europe/comments/lmg428/european_countries_with_a_higher_life_expectancy/gnxbtot/,Sam-Porter-Bridges,1613679133

3231,"&gt; It is the other way around. AZ put the commission in a very difficult position.

Come on mate, the Commission could have simply put out a statement saying they were disappointed with the shortfall and were working with AZ to ensure that supply accelerates to meet the lost demand. 

Every single vaccine manufacturer has suffered supply setbacks, and yet the ONLY people who have howled in protest and threatened to sue are some EU member state governments (e.g. Italy, Belgium) and the European Commission. 

The UK, the United States, Canada, and (to be fair) most EU countries have not made a big deal out of the setbacks, they have understood that the situation is difficult and uncertain, and that being belligerent with the companies who are crucial to overcoming this crisis is incredibly counter-productive.

&gt; He is praising the UK and blaming the EU in the same interview. And if you ""believe"" him to act maliciously you could construct it as playing the EU vs the UK. (I don't think he is acting maliciously, again i think he's tone deaf, or incompetent in PR terms if you will)

He's not praising the UK and blaming the EU. These things need to be viewed in context, he explains that the whole manufacturing process began earlier in the UK and that those plants are further along, more experienced and have had time to overcome the teething problems. That shouldn't be controversial. The shortfall for AZ supply in Q1 is a) partly bad luck, and b) a consequence of the Commissions inefficient procurement process. It's incredibly disingenuous to say that the EU shares no blame.

&gt; Saying your customer ordered too late 

They did order later than countries like the US and UK, the Commission was demonstrably less proactive. 

&gt; and that everything was ""best effort"" is only evading your responsibility by laying the blame somewhere else?

Until the EU has any evidence that AZ did not make best effort, you have no argument. The contract stipulates targets, not guarantees. 

&gt; Car manufacturers had to delay shipment this and last year due to missing parts. Did they blame their customers for ordering late and evading their obligation by saying that it was only best effort (expected delivery date)?

Did their customers run to the media and begin threatening to sue, accuse them of robbery, etc...??? It's not a good analogy anyway.",United Kingdom - We hold all the fish ,/r/europe/comments/lmhpua/astrazenecas_vaccine_contract_with_the_uk_is/gnws24b/,MyFavouriteAxe,1613671051

3396,"&gt; Every vaccine manufacturer already is bound by the legal clause of non-discrimination between contract recipients. It's not a new thing, if it's best effort for everyone and nobody has priority either the cuts are equal or it's a breach.

Well Pfizer aren't exporting any of their US made doses, funny how the Commission hasn't said anything about that...

&gt; And it's not like all manufacturers actually signed for delivering what they could not do. Only AZ pulled this kind of stuff and notified late: Pfizer had issues, notified the commission and solved them, AZ had issues, notified late the commission and then said ""sod it"" when it was pointed out that UK received pretty much all their doses.

That's really misleading. Pfizer had a significant shortfall (though not quite as bad as AZ) and has not solved the issue. They have instead upgraded their facilities to improve supply in the future, that does not *solve* the previous shortfall. Moderna are also not able to deliver as many doses this quarter as they initially promised, though again, not to the same degree as AZ. 

It takes 3 months to make the oxford vaccine, yield is only know in the latest stages. It is, quite literally, not possible for AZ to make up the shortfall this quarter. This isn't complicated, it's very, very simple. They will instead try to make more doses in subsequent quarters to make up for the poor performance in the first round - you cannot expect them to do more than that. 

&gt;""sod it"" when it was pointed out that UK received pretty much all their doses.

That's irrelevant. The UK manufacturing process is separate from the EU manufacturing process, we don't share the resources and we have out own, self contained supply chain. We started investing in this months before you, we took risks on this vaccine that would have wasted a lot of money if it didn't work.

It all depends, if there's a valid reason, then no, not really. The location will have been picked on the basis of pragmatism, not some weird view that Scots lives are less valuable, that's just frankly absurd.

I don't think you quite understand the levels of preparation that individuals put into selection and the attrition rate as things stand. Offering further opportunities would not generate greater trained strength, it would just stagger the numbers coming through the pipeline. The impact of the deaths has led to reforms within the training system, I have no idea if it's seen reduced numbers. As for more Scots in the SF, by all means, but right now the pool to draw from is shrinking (if you look at the strengths of SCOTS DIV units then you'll see what I'm talking about) and the quality isn't higher than most other line infantry units.

Regarding warmongering, there's a huge argument that the latest instability in the middle east ultimately stems from the Sykes-Picot agreement and the borders created there. This is what I mean by turning round and stating we've now changed doesn't make a whole heap of difference, we're still dealing with fallout from the past that we can't in good conscience just ignore.

3471,"&gt; (i haven't seen a source for that claim however)

Here's a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55838272) which mentions it, specifically:

&gt; Some doses were sent to Germany and the Netherlands last year for a process called fill-and-finish, which involves putting it into vials. This is now being done at a plant in Wrexham, creating a complete UK supply chain.
&gt; And that arrangement, AstraZeneca sources say, had no impact on the production problems the EU vaccine manufacturing plants experienced.

&gt; If it was the vaccine, then point 3 must be false, as that would be ""exporting"".

That's just semantics. We might as well say that they are not 'vaccines' until the process is complete, i.e. filled and finished. Before then it is an intermediary product.

&gt; In the grand scheme of things this all won't matter. It will take at least until the middle of the year until life can return to normal, the 4 million doses we can debate about won't make a difference.

I agree. Btw, the estimates for the initial doses (be they filled and finished or entirely manufactured) which came from the EU are a range that goes from 0.5m up to 3.5m.

3577,"&gt; I did say killing people though, not forcing them to work. 

They had 2 categories at Auschwitz, and the camps that werent death camps were labor camps. Germany both benefited from slave labor and committed ethnic-religious motivated genocide, it's a fact. They even turned the Holocaust victim's bodies into soap, to tell you how vicious and economically ruthless they were.

What I am trying to tell you is that the economic motivation is the primary motivation in our society, everything else is derived from that. The reason why you have or dont have a war are all tied to this. Hopefully we won't have a WW3 due to international trade being so fluent, but it's not guaranteed. It's all about economic interests and profit seeking unfortunately. This is what happens when society is not people oriented, but money oriented.

&gt; That you failed to google ""jailed billionaires""

Fine I concede, but notice these guys are either black swans, or they just stole from other rich people. Look at that Bernie Madoff guy with the ponzi scheme, he only got into jail because he stole from other billionaires and bankers, but the executives at Barklays bank for example who steal all the time, mostly from poor or mortgate owners [1](https://www.ft.com/content/a255cd2a-fef8-11e4-84b2-00144feabdc0) [2](https://www.ft.com/content/2a4479f8-c030-11e1-9867-00144feabdc0) [3](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barclays-regulations-gold-idUSBREA4M06620140523), get off with a slap on the wrist. 

So it's very rare for them to be punished, and in the rare occasion that they do get, they get sacrificed to save the rest of their class.

&gt; That you avoided my question and that you are blaming social democracy for its non-failures when other movements have ended up in the exact same situation because we live in the same planet. 

I am blaming it for it's weakness and it's contraditions, which make it weak. I am not against helping out the poor with welfare if they need it, I am just saying it's not a permanent solution, and if you just keep giving them welfare without actually eliminating poverty and it's causes then you are just like a dog owner who gives a bone to his starving dogs, it's not emancipatory.

&gt; Or do you think China is not using a capitalist economy? 

Of course they do, since we are still in the capitalist era, it's stupid to deny it and there is no way to isolate yourself from it. The soviets and the eastern block were still capitalists, they just used a nationalized economy to eliminate some of the side effects of capitalism, but they didn't outpaced capitalism, it was state capitalism.

I know it has a lot of contradictory definitions, but the traditional definition of socialism is the era between capitalism and communism, or a transitory period where capitalism is being dismantled and society moves towards communism. By this definition China, Cuba,Vietnam,etc... can be called socialist. So it might have a capitalist underlayer, but definitely the political power and their society is run differently. China is even more modest because they say that they havent even reached socialism yet, so a stage between capitalism and socialism, they say that they will count socialism only after 2050 when they will be advanced enough to transition towards communism. I think it could be called socialist if their goal is communism and they havent given up that goal, which I don't think they have.

&gt; abandoned public ownership of most industries.

Again, there is a false dichotomy here between public and private. I don't think  it has any meaning, since we have seen from the past that full public ownership didnt worked out exactly either. I myself am also a proponent (for the short term at least) for a mixed economy. You know Marx himself never talked about public vs private, it has nothing to do with Marxist economics, and his suggestions in the manifesto (to centralize some means of production) doesnt specify how to do it. However what matters though is the rate of profit, and the shape of capitalism, now that might be a better indicator how far we have come, and not the amount of % of public ownership.

&gt; Yes, but saying ""as unregulated a free market as possible"" is a mouthful. 

I didnt said that.

&gt; You really don't get that Africa doesn't produce much, don't you?

This is where your computer and phone comes from boss.

&gt; Planned economies also have to deal with them. 

It's an organizational/logistical issue, that I frankly don't know the answer to, however I do know that fixing 1 price can create [unpredictable consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) that governments tend to ignore, because they never  have scientists as advisors.

&gt; So companies want low prices? Is that what you think? 

Absolutely not, but in the past, in a fluent economy you usually had reasonable prices, they put a 20-30% markup usually and that's it. Now with IP and other trade agreements they can just ask shameless prices and nobody will know any better. This is illogical even by their supply demand rules which would normally move prices to reasonable levels, now it's just a complete ripoff. Of course there is a time element too, new stuff costs a lot due to the fashion element, but you can still buy second hand stuff for cheap, it's just that it's not cool and trendy if you do that, so you are forced to be a brainless consumer to buy the most expensive most useless stuff and ignore your own needs, and give in to your desires that you get manipulated into by the advertising industry. There is a difference between objective needs and subjective desires.

&gt; Fake money results in inflation. You need stuff to have money that is worth anything. 

It does, which is exactly why neoliberalism ends after a certain limit is reached. They cant just simply cut every welfare program while shoving billions into corporations, it will end badly for them. However this doesnt prove that welfare economics is correct, you just have saved a horrible system from collapse, so you just did it a favor. Social-democrats are still pro-capitalists, they are just the smart ones.

&gt; That is not how austerity works. 

My current government is trying this as we speak, we will see how long they last until the social-democrat party comes to power.

&gt; This isn't what social democracy is. 

I know what it is, I have read up the ideology , and all the refutations to it. You know what the most funny thing is, is that Marx spent half of his life to actually argue against ""socialists"" (social-democrats) of the era. He didnt spent much time arguing with liberals and conservatives by ideology, most of his time he spent arguing with social-democrats. And after the 2nd international, it became obvious where social-democracy has devolved. I could go into detail, but my post is very long as it is.

&gt; And in post scarcity economics, your supply is by definition infinite. 

We have a different understanding of what post-scarcity means. I don't think of it as abundant as air, like we will all have ferraris and yachts and mansions, that is obviously absurd (maybe after we get intergalactic we will have resources for that but certainly not on this planet). What I mean by post scarcity is that people's basic needs are all fulfilled, by having the productive mechanism reoriented towards that. Everyone gets a house, transport, healthcare, food, entertainment, and other human needs fulfilled. You wont get a ferrari because you dont need it, but you will get an adequate public transportation system to carry everywhere. 

And the most important part is you dont produce stuff you dont need, so the luxury industry will be abolished. Why have yachts and private jets, to pollute the planet? It makes no sense.

&gt; So, a hobby? 

Yeah, by that time there wont be a division between hobby and work. Nowadays people distinguish between work and play, work is a choir you have to do to get money to survive, and play is a hobby you like to do, creatively or for other reasons, that makes you happy. How about you dont have to worry about money, because all your needs are taken care of, and you can just do productive work that makes you happy. 

&gt; Lovely quote.

And to be honest, I don't know of any other derogatory terms for the French in German.  It seems our ancestors deemed one derogatory term to be sufficient.

Unless you count the (even more outdated) term ""Welscher"" - which is more of a case of using a term derogatorily (like saying ""German"" in a derogatory manner) and not a case of a genuine insult. It is no coincidence that it sounds like the English ""Welsh"" though (who are called ""Waliser"" in German), since the term ""welsh""/""welsch"" originated over a thousand years back, and denoted Celts, or Celts who had adapted to the Roman lifestyle and Romans, adapting over time to mean generally all Romance people, or rather the Romance people that were nearest to oneself (Italians for Austria, the French for Germany, etc.).

3653,"Dude, over a million people people have gone through these camps. There are 12 million Uyghurs in China.

This is not just fighting terror. It is repressing people for being different. 

&gt;	Kayrat Samarkand, a Kazakh citizen who migrated from Xinjiang, was detained in one of the re-education camps in the region for three months for visiting neighboring Kazakhstan. On 15 February 2018, Kazakh Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov sent a diplomatic note to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the same day as Kayrat Samarkand was freed from custody.[190] After his release, Samarkand said that he faced endless brainwashing and humiliation, and that he was forced to study communist propaganda for hours every day and chant slogans giving thanks and wishing for a long life to Xi Jinping.[191][better source needed]


&gt;Mihrigul Tursun, an Uyghur woman detained in China, after escaping one of these camps, talked of beatings and torture. After moving to Egypt, she traveled to China in 2015 to spend time with her family and was immediately detained and separated from her infant children. When Tursun was released three months later, one of the triplets had died and the other two had developed health problems. Tursun said the children had been operated on. She was arrested for the second time about two years later. Several months later, she was detained the third time and spent three months in a cramped prison cell with 60 other women, having to sleep in turns, use the toilet in front of security cameras and sing songs praising the Chinese Communist Party.[192]

&gt;
Tursun said she and other inmates were forced to take unknown medication, including pills that made them faint and a white liquid that caused bleeding in some women and loss of menstruation in others. Tursun said nine women from her cell died during her three months there. One day, Tursun recalled, she was led into a room and placed in a high chair, and her legs and arms were locked in place. ""The authorities put a helmet-like thing on my head, and each time I was electrocuted, my whole body would shake violently and I would feel the pain in my veins,"" Tursun said in a statement read by a translator. ""I don't remember the rest. White foam came out of my mouth, and I began to lose consciousness,"" Tursun said. ""The last word I heard them saying is that you being an Uyghur is a crime."" She was eventually released so that she could take her children to Egypt, but she was ordered to return to China. Once in Cairo, Tursun contacted U.S. authorities and, in September, came to the United States and settled in Virginia.[193] China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying has stated that Tursun was taken into custody by police on ""suspicion of inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination"" for a period lasting 20 days, but denies that Tursun was ever detained in a re- 
education camp. [194][195][196]

&gt;	According to Time, Sarsenbek Akaruli, 45, a veterinarian and trader from Ili, Xinjiang, was arrested in Xinjiang on 2 November 2017. As of November 2019, he is still in a detention camp. According to his wife Gulnur Kosdaulet, Akaruli was put in the camp after police found the banned messaging app WhatsApp on his cell phone. Kosdaulet, a citizen of neighboring Kazakhstan, has traveled to Xinjiang on four occasions to search for her husband but could not get help from friends in the Chinese Communist Party. Kosdaulet said of her friends, ‚ÄúNobody wanted to risk being recorded on security cameras talking to me in case they ended up in the camps themselves.‚Äù[214]

Except that the UK didn't leave a trading block, it left a supranational political entity that happened to include a trading block. 

You know perfectly well that if the EU was about trade and trade alone, the UK would never have left. There was never meaningful public objection to a trading union, Brexit was entirely about the EU's political powers and political ambitions. 

&gt; Money already flowing out of the UK.

Capital flows don't mean an awful lot if the risk is still being taken in London, which it is. Investment firms are strategically moving some parts of their operations to the continent in order to comply with EU regulation. They will move as few key roles as they reasonably can. 

You are also acting like all of this was inevitable, it wasn't. There is literally no good reason for the EU not grant financial equivalence, they already do for a couple of dozen other jurisdictions  (US, Australia, Singapore, UAE, etc...) with *no precondition for regulatory alignment*. It's high pettiness and a policy designed to to try to hurt the UK economy, it's indefensible given that granting equivalence to the UK does not undermine the EU in anyway. 

Not only has this behavior fragmented European financial markets (which means greater systemic risk and poorer liquidity), but most of the derivatives business which as moved out of London has not gone to the EU, it has gone to the US, Tokyo, Singapore, etc...

In very very simple terms there were two waves of Swedish rampaging across central and eastern Europe for reasons, complicated dynastic, political and religious reasons.

The first was during the 30 years war Gustav Adolf swept across northern Germany and Poland winning a bunch of battles and capturing a great many things and sent them back to Sweden. He was a fascinating guy and regarded as a military genius. But he died in battle early on.

Second is what's called the Deluge which was basically the end of the Polish Lithuanian commonwealth as a great power. Sweden and Russia invaded what is now Poland and Ukraine, they were eventually driven back but at tremendous cost.

3778,"Oh, Tito was a personality all right.

The thing is, and this is key for Tito - his Partisan forces pretty much had to fight the Nazis, Ustashe and Chetniks on their own. And he lead the communist revolution from a cave in Bosnia. And he was already such a threat that the Nazis sent Otto Skorzeny to eliminate him, although Tito fled the onslaught.

Only after 1944 and after the tide has turned over did the US shift support towards the Partisans. And Tito was lucky that the Red Army didnt enter Yugoslavia's borders, and therefore could claim sovereignty over the USSR.

Stalin was definetly angry as hell, as he knew Tito personally: Tito was originally a sergeant in the Austro-Hungarian army during WWI and was held in a hospital in Omsk, before he got turned over to communism. He was in an illegal communist party in then Kingdom of Yugoslavia for decades when WWII broke out, and suddenly, he told USSR to fuck off.

And Stalin wanted Yugoslavia for a simple reason: the Adriatic Sea, with the direct access to the Mediterranean, without having to deal with Turkey. Also, we also did have some oil reserves as well. He wanted it so much that he sent assassins no less than 20 times, with Beria employing increasingly James Bondian methods to execute him (flesh eating bacteria, nerve gas in musical boxes, bombs, etc., which Tito all survived. And yes, the infamous Tiro letter to Stalin is real, and some say he actually was behind Stalin's death.

3985,"I'll bite.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not really a wholly comparable issue. The Romani's issue is at its root not racial. But it is cultural. For example their fairy tales are about smart Romani screwing over the dumb gadjo and taking their stuff or otherwise taking advantage of them (and not because the gadjo in question would be somehow villains of the story, they are just good sources of selfish opportunity). 

If people will say they don't like carnies, then probably no one will think that's racist, and some might even agree. But spot the difference to Romani who originally came to Europe also in caravans, having little incentive to actually get along with local population, and according to even medieval chronicles did screw people over a lot.

We're sadly not living in a TV series where every culture would have to be innately noble because the script writer said so. The Romani found a niche where they could screw people over and it enabled them to live a particular existence.

Which is not to say there is no racism. There is. But also this prejudice formed in people for a particular reason.

That said, there's now a majority of Romani who integrate well into the society, now that they have the opportunity. But the thing is, there's very little Romani about them. They're really just swarthy Czechs or Germans or Romanians or what have you. They had to give up that culture. 

If you look at it through the prism of ""race"" and ""racism"" then I guess you get the whole shebang of a ""minority oppressed for its race"" by ""racists"" who are then redeemed and lose their ""racism"", so now the ""liberated minority"" can join in with the ""redeemed racists"".

What I meant to poke at by mentioning it is that I think his thought tends to not rely structurally on a core set of marxist ideas, and insofar as he agrees on many topics with many marxists, which I think he certainly does, it's in the context of a longer history of popular struggles whose ideas he takes equally seriously.

Instead, and I can't find you a source for this, I'm pretty sure he sites himself in a different tradition, which has some parallels to marxists and some agreement with them, but is not fundamentally the same body of thought.",,/r/europe/comments/lm34nt/romania_how_communism_propaganda_looked_like_vs/gntrbmq/,eliminating_coasts,1613606129

During the Russian civil war there was also not just a red army (Soviets) but also the black army (anarcho-communists) fighting the Tsars. There was an anarcho-communist state for a while in Ukraine until they were betrayed by the red army and invaded despite their alliance.

And anarcho-communism is probably one of the most extreme examples of a different type of socialism to what the USSR was. Almost the complete opposite. There are many theoretical forms of socialism. And even if they were all theoretical and no other forms were tried, they are still drastically different ideologies to what the USSR was so there is no reason to disregard their viability based on the USSR being terrible.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/lm34nt/romania_how_communism_propaganda_looked_like_vs/gntsiep/,RegisEst,1613606726

I literally said that these are people who told me that they wish could go back to those days.

Also your theory that most Romanian communists are young people who didn't experience it is demonstrably wrong. A 2010 poll showed that 41% would have voted for Ceausescu if they could and 63% said their life was better under Communism.

Prince Philip hospitalized after feeling unwell, Buckingham Palace says
Hannah Yasharoff
USA TODAY

Prince Philip, the 99-year-old husband to Queen Elizabeth II, was admitted to the hospital Tuesday evening after feeling unwell, Buckingham Palace confirmed Wednesday. 

The palace called his admittance to London's King Edward VII Hospital a precautionary measure and noted he is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days of observation and rest.

The Duke of Edinburgh, the oldest and longest-serving royal consort in British history, celebrated his 99th birthday in June without much of a fuss at Windsor Castle, where both he and the queen have been self-isolating since mid-March amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Queen Elizabeth, 94, and Philip have received their COVID-19 vaccinations, the palace said last month. 

The queen wanted to go public with news of their vaccinations to dispel further speculation or inaccuracies about whether they received it. A household doctor at Windsor Castle administered the vaccines.
Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh pose for a photo June 1, 2020, in the quadrangle of Windsor Castle.

The royal couple has been married since 1947. He and the queen have four children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

He was born June 10, 1921, on the Greek island of Corfu, son of a prince of the Greek and Danish royal families. A former naval officer and keen polo player, Philip enjoyed robust health well into old age but has had a number of health issues in recent years.

In 2011, he was rushed to a hospital by helicopter after suffering chest pains and treated for a blocked coronary artery. In 2017, he spent two nights in the King Edward VII hospital and was hospitalized for 10 days in 2018 for a hip replacement.

More:Prince William is 'very proud' of Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip for getting COVID-19 vaccines

Philip was last hospitalized in December 2019, spending four nights in the King Edward VII Hospital for what the palace said was planned treatment of a pre-existing condition.

He gave up driving at the age of 97, after smashing into a car while driving a Land Rover near Sandringham estate in January 2019. Philip needed help to get out of the Land Rover but wasn‚Äôt injured. A woman in the other vehicle suffered a broken wrist.

Philip has carried out thousands of public engagements over the decades, until he retired from public life in 2017. Until the pandemic struck, he had been living at Wood Farm, a modest cottage on the edge of Sandringham, the sprawling royal estate in Norfolk where the royal family typically spends Christmas holidays.

4345,"&gt; I do think you should have made it clear at the start, because citing how self determination is basic human right doesn't make a lot of sense, because you are appealing yourself to international law, which by its nature exist to ensure the survival of the current political framework which is not an anarchist one.

Thats a fair point. I originally did not intend to take this argument into the realms of Anarchism tho. I just think a system where self determination is stronger then state integrity would result in a better system. That system by its nature would be more anarchistic ofc. You did bring up very valid points and if executed poorly, it certainly would only result in chaos and other states using it as a weapon.  
  
&gt;Catalan separatist are not proposing an anarchist commute and they are not in any way theoretically advocating to move from a state system to an anarchist one, the separation of Catalonia will just create a smaller ethnostate or nation state while disrupting the economic and political viability of the area making everyone life worst.  
  
I do agree it does not seem like good policy, but still if they would have a large majority behind it, imo they should have the right to make the move. Also I assume, should that happen, they would be integrated into the EU, which ofc would not solve all the economical problems, but would definitely soften the blow.  
  
&gt;I don't think an anarchist system is actually acheavable and if it is we are quite far away from achieving it.  
  
This is something people often ask me, but you have to think about it in a different way. How can I make this system more anarchistic? We can try and plane the perfect system, but utopias dont work in reality. We should instead aim to always better our current systems. This is why I think allowing complete self determination can be a very interesting thing, that would long term allow Anarchist communities to from and become completely independent. Keeping in mind that while imperialist superstates exist, these communities would have an extremely hard time surviving. Not impossible, there have been very long running anarchistic societies sometimes managing quiet large territories.  
  
&gt;I don't really have an opinion if a state based system is better or worst than an anarchist one, you could propose me some reading on that.  
  
The most influential book in that regard to my knowledge is [Conquest of Bread by Kropotkin](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread/), which heavily influenced the Spanish civil war. I also read about [Revolutionary Catalonia at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia) and other places, very fascinating and fits into our conversation quiet well. :)   
These might be a bit date views on Anarchism tho. One way to look at Anarchism is: Its identifying power structures and questioning their validity and justification. The natural end result to this thinking is questioning the largest power, the state, but there are many other power structures you can apply this thinking to (a very controversial example is family). Also when you question the power structure of the state, you dont have to go all out and want to abolish the state straight away. You can suggest things like more power should remain at locally elected bodies instead of the state having all the power. For example Spain is a much more anarchistic country to my understanding then Hungary, I imagine bc its rich anarchistic history. In Hungary we barely have any power at locally elected bodies and most power lies at the government, especially recently, as they centralize more and more power.",,/r/europe/comments/ll1arr/spanish_police_storm_university_in_lleida_and/gnsv8za/,xxx4wow,1613591976

4415,"&gt;Would you prefer to be in a federal EU (that is, being one of the states of the USofE) or being independent, with a huge neighbor as the USofE?

Without trying to sound rude, it is so much a fantasy question without an clear example of how it would look like, that I can't answer that question.

I don't believe the EU in its current form will federalize, we saw the budget crisis last year, it was a slaughterhouse. In the case of a federation we would instantly throw away more wealth then we did now.

If this USofE would happen it would depend on every member to follow the agreements they signed up for. And as long as members can't or won't do it, I just don't see it happen. Even the most pro EU members like France can't even uphold their own agreements.

When countries show for an amount of time they are actually following all the rules, I would have no issues into moving forward.

So to answer your question, the Netherlands won't be kicked out of anything, it would just default in a two-speed Europe. The rest can federalize, we would stay on the sideline with other countries just be there for the trade and pay into EU budgets as we currently do.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/llvzff/eu_members_where_more_people_are_in_favor_dark/gnsefyh/,Esiq,1613584549

But a serious move to change that would I am confident mean the end of the United States. Not that it is really possible, it's practically impossible constitutionally.

4431,"Just having elections for Parliament is enough, they can then establish a government (including the Head of Government) on their own. That's how most EU countries do it already. 

The best system for electing Parliament would definitely be a version of the one that's already commonly used: We vote for local representatives, then extra seats are given to the different political parties based on their percentage of the total vote compared to the amount of seats they've already won.

If smaller countries become ""irrelevant"" as you say because they only have 1 or 2 seats, well, that's just how it is then. Having proportional and fair representation is what's most important, and if their local population would truly get so screwed over by this, then I don't see how they could function as part of a union anyways. 

Local representation in a federal government is pretty overrated either way in my opinion.

4518,"&gt; Fair, though after a hundred thousand people I hardly think scale matters much.

It matters hugely between the scale of Switzerland and the EU. I favour small nations like Switzerland.

&gt;The court is responsible for this, not the commission.

Only if it is challenged. In the past we have seen the EU take on aspects and if no one complains it assumes this as normative.

&gt; How does this solve the problem of European countries repeating the issues of procuring equipment that we had last spring?

It doesn't. Because medicine isn't an issue delegated to the EU so it shouldn't be the EU's problem to solve.

&gt; I'm not suggesting anything. It is Europe without the EU. Or is that too eastern for you?

&gt;We can start about the fascist dictatorships of Iberia or the Berlin Wall if you'd like?

No I'm objecting because these issues weren't solved by the EU. If the EU disappeared tomorrow the nations of Europe wouldn't start fighting again.  You're giving credit to the EU for something it didn't solve.

&gt; A principle of majority voting or unanimity would actually guarantee it.

Unanimity to deploy the military outside the EU? Maybe but France wouldn't accept that.

&gt; All of those parties have been opposed at times (En Marche I think is the exception, but they're barely five years old). True, none of them are against the principle of intervening, but almost no party anywhere in the world is.

Exactly, which is why it is preferable not to be in Union with them. If they go to war in Africa, well I don't like it but at least it's not in my name.

&gt; Who's interests? And what guarantees small countries won't be pressured to intervene by said interests?

Business leaders, foreign governments any stakeholder with interest. 

Nothing guarantees small nations won't intervene but they have less capacity to do so. My country, Ireland, intervenes very little in Africa. Partly because as a former colony we are sympathetic to the victims of colonialism but also partly because as a small nation we have a very small military. 

So part of the advantage of being a small nation is to take away the ability of politicians to intervene in foreign countries.",,/r/europe/comments/lkzrdp/farright_le_pen_could_win_french_presidency_in/gnsc1jv/,Fargrad,1613583624

But this is what I am telling you that the UN General Assembly is completely ignored and completely decorative organ without any powers, and all the power is held in the UN Security Council which is dominated by the western powers, so they can do whatever they want.

US, UK, Poland and Australia. True. 

The security Council can't be dominated. Every permanent member has a veto and the temporary members can also outvote a resolution. 

&gt;I dont see the difference, we are just playing with semantics here.

You can project the image of a strongman without being a dictator. 

&gt;Orban is nowhere near as powerful as Putin, and I am not talking about absolute terms. He and the FIDESZ can easily lose an election in the future, if the population mobilises. In Russia however you are ruled with an iron fist as we can see with the recent crackdowns, they just simply dont allow any opposition, so there the Russia Unite party is basically a 1 party system.

Yes, that's why Orban is only a strongman. 

&gt;Nowadays maybe but were they earlier? During the Bush era when all these wars happened, they were ignored. Even when the war on terror started and the islamophobic propaganda was ramped up, they were always exempted from that. Of course now that that warmongering rhetoric is fading, progressive voices are now shouting out, but the criticism didnt existed in the past.

I'm too young to comment on this. I'll assume you're right. 

&gt;I am not saying to micromanage everything to guarantee this, it's just that the economy should eventually tend towards this. There is no reason why a country should not be economically strong and healthy, and for that it has to ensure this balance. I believe eventually we will end up with a harmonic world, but it's a long way to go.

This isn't a guaranteed thing or a necessarily good one. Economists are still debating this. 

&gt;Are you referring to these ""unessential services""? Well if you have everything produced in the 3rd world, then the 1st world can just be made up of lazy UBI recipients who play video games all day and go to bars all day. It would be the liberal utopia, just get the benefits and enjoy your hedonistic desires while others work for it. Obviously this is where many liberals want the economy to go, but they will be shocked when reality slaps them on the face and they find out that this system is unsustainable, both environmentally as economically.

Are you using the term liberal correctly here? Why would liberals want UBI? They don't stand for such principles! And in practical terms, no ideology actually defends laziness.

Because this means it was accidental and completely unplanned? It's not a moral judgment for me, it has nothing to do with religion or anything, it's just that having children really is something that requires a lot of preparation and planning beforehand, you have to be ready for it.

Nobody would actually *choose* to have a child from a random hookup, unless they either didn't have access to abortion, or believed abortion is murder and felt trapped into keeping the baby. How exactly is that a good thing in your book?

I want the media to talk about it, not the circlejerk with some people over it who's opinion society considers irrelevant. And not just because they have some misogynists but because they're men.

Speaking of statistics maybe you should have educated yourself about trans murder statistics before claiming they have it the worst.  

&gt;Women aren't primarily assaulted by women, trans people aren't primarily being oppressed by other trans people. Do you want to know who's doing the killing of most men? I'll give you one guess.  

Oh, well that makes it okay then! All the murdered men were probably just asking to be killed! I'm sure no murdered men were innocent! Men, you know?

4731,"&gt; Subsidiarity is practiced though. There is a reason that development funds for example are distributed regionally. Why you think centralisation is inevitable in anything is beyond me.

Because it is, we see both in the US and India examples of cases where the federal government has over time accepted more power to itself and the modern incarnations are different to those that began. Its the nature of governments to always look for more power to themselves. 

The recent covid pandemic is a good example, medicine and health is an issue reserved for member states but  now we have the EU procuring vaccines for the bloc. 

Now you may argue that this is an emergency and the EU is more efficient to buy vaccines, regardless of the efficacy of the argument I would respond with governments always have reasons to take more powers and never reasons to give them back. There will always be some excuse to centralise power.

&gt; And anyway, the level closest to the citizen isn't the national one or even the regional one. It's the local one: City, community, county, parish, or whatever such local administration.

Sure, governmance should be as close to the citizen as possible. I agree but I go further. Sovereignty should be as close to the cofozen as possible. An independent county council isn't feasible but an independent nation of a couple million is feasible and desirable.

&gt; And the EU is definitely both a peace project and our only way to remain with a voice in this world. Otherwise we'll end up either in stupid wars with each other like Ukraine and Russia, divided by foreign powers, like EE in the second WW or the whole of Europe in the cold War, or more likely both, fighting foreign proxy wars among ourselves.

The EU is the **only** way to avoid war in Europe? Come on. You don't really believe that.

&gt; Foreign wars in our name will still be fought, but they'll be between us.

War in Europe isn't worse than war in the Sahel. Maybe Mali would send soldiers to France if they ask. 

&gt; I wouldn't, of course, want my country to be part of the US. But that comes from geographic impossibility and different beliefs in political systems, like my dislike for Presidents, especially powerful ones, assimilatory practices and so on, rather than an aversion to subsidiarity based federalism.

Well France has territory in South America so geography obviously isn't a problem. The US has no official language so a state could have any language they wanted and your geography means you wouldn't be assimilated.

&gt; Why wouldn't you want to be part of an empire, assuming you're allowed to keep your language, culture and customs?

Well I've just given you several reasons but I'll leave you with this. Those who wish to create an Empire only wish to exert power. They won't limit themselves to using that power to avoid influence from the US and China. They will use that power both externally, on their perceived enemies in the third world and internally, on their perceived enemies within their perceived union.",,/r/europe/comments/lkzrdp/farright_le_pen_could_win_french_presidency_in/gnqtumr/,Fargrad,1613548935

So it wasn't really a problem it was so big because the Allies were only using it to show their constituents they did good, but German citizens couldn't have felt that they did really bad by having such a high nominal reparation to pay?

It also ignores the fact that all wars from the Napoleonic wars onwards had an exponential growth in reparations, regardless of which side won. For crying out loud, the bi-metal standard fell shortly after the Franco-Prussian war because the Prussians asked for a bunch of Silver, and France, who had the International Silver Stock Exchange, intentionally inflated its price in order to stick one to them and collapsed the Silver market. Just because there was a leeway with negotiations doesn't mean that those reparations didn't exist or didn't grow more and more with each war between the Major Powers.

4754,"One must be careful of antivax propaganda which is circulating.

1. The AZ vaccine (which is by far the most common vaccine in the UK) is approved for use with doses 12 weeks apart, and in fact in trials these individuals saw better results.

2. Even if wider spacing did cause a drop in efficacy, the drop would have to be huge in order to justify prioritising ""fully vaccinating"" one person over partially vaccinating two people. The primary and most immediate goal of the vaccination programme is to prevent hospitalisations and death, and a single dose with a reasonable efficacy is sufficient to do this. ""Zero covid"" comes later, if it is even possible.

3. No, people being vaccinated does not create mutations in the virus or help them to propagate. It is not a binary thing where 1 dose = partially vaccinated and 2 doses = fully vaccinated. Rather, all vaccinated individuals are ""partially vaccinated"" to varying degrees (whether they have had 1 shot or 2 shots), which is expressed as a percentage efficacy.

&gt;...           

&gt;Notwithstanding numerous elections and EU membership since 2007, the real winners of Romania‚Äôs transition to democracy are the security elite ‚Äì the former members of the Securitate, and their successor generation, who protect their elders‚Äô fortunes as they make their own.  

&gt;Romania remains intensely conflicted over its recent past, and constrained by it, even if that‚Äôs not what first meets a visitor‚Äôs eye. Romania is, after all, a country that has ostensibly segued into the European mainstream, with an urban middle class that drives fine automobiles and converses with ease in foreign languages.

&gt;Today, nine security services, the heirs of the Securitate colossus, operate behind the scenes in Romania, or, in some cases, openly ‚Äì to manipulate politics and enrich their members at the expense of ordinary Romanians.        
&gt;The country‚Äôs main domestic security agency, the SRI, operates with a budget larger than that of Germany‚Äôs equivalent, the Verfassungsschutz, and nearly 2.5 times that of the equivalent in the Netherlands, the EU country closest to Romania in population. It is estimated to employ 12,000 people  ‚Äì the official numbers are undisclosed, and my requests for an interview were refused ‚Äì six times more than the 17-million populous Netherlands.          
&gt;Despite a change of generations, Romania‚Äôs security services are not only lavishly bankrolled but largely unchecked by other government agencies. Although much progress has been made, Romania still has a long way to go to internalize the rule of law.

&gt;...

&gt;This influence distorts democracy, says Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, a Romanian civic activist and a leading scholar on corruption. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs long been ample evidence of a ‚Äòdeep state‚Äô in Romania with roots in the former security services,‚Äù she maintains. 

&gt;‚ÄúThe 1991 national security laws, which they basically wrote themselves, made the services unaccountable and enabled their economic empire. Anti-corruption campaigns gave them the power to control judges and politicians. But nobody effectively controls them,‚Äù she says.

&gt;Romania‚Äôs corruption, as well as the persistent abuse of power and other democratic deficits, is routinely condemned by the EU, which refuses to cede Romania the privileges of the passport-free Schengen zone because of it. According to one study, more than 38.6 billion euros is lost every year to corruption ‚Äì nearly 16 per cent of GDP. 

&gt;It‚Äôs not as if there haven‚Äôt been efforts to tame it. In the past decade, Romanian courts have convicted high-level functionaries, government ministers, ex-ministers and other high-level functionaries; media moguls; business tycoons; a former chief prosecutor; and deputies from both houses of parliament. 

&gt;...

&gt;As a journalist living in Hungary, I reported undercover from Romania in November 1989, when foreigners were personae non grata, and foreign journalists especially so. The country was crawling with military police: on street corners, in subway stations, on trains. Beneath straight faces, Romanians seethed with resentment and frustration, well aware of the protests that had upended communism elsewhere in Central Europe but fearful that Ceausescu would instigate a bloodbath, just as China‚Äôs communist regime had done that spring at Tiananmen Square. But, I sensed, it was only a question of time before that pent-up hostility erupted. 

&gt;...

&gt;It is after December 21 that the revolution‚Äôs narrative of events becomes murky. Many sources are still under lock and key ‚Äì a product of the security elite‚Äôs influence ‚Äì but a young generation of Romanian historians has nailed down most of the facts. The Ceausescus‚Äô flight on the morning of December 22 didn‚Äôt end the bloodshed; most of the capital city‚Äôs more than 500 casualties were inflicted after the Ceausescus‚Äô foiled escape. 

&gt;Following a brief lull, Securitate and army units battled on. But it was not to defend the headless regime or to reinforce the revolutionaries, regardless of what many of them thought they were doing. Rather, the new powerbrokers‚Äîa group of second-tier party officials, Securitate and army generals, and some dissident former communists ‚Äì sought to create the illusion of a popular revolution, with the secret police and the army fighting side by side with armed civilians. 

&gt;...

&gt;Although historians have made much headway in clarifying the opaque events of that December, many interpretations, including wild conspiracy theories, still circulate. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no official version of the revolution, no one book or report,‚Äù explains historian Madalin Hodor, a researcher working in the public archives of the Ceausescu-era Securitate (CNSAS). ‚ÄúThe events of 1989 are still extremely politicized,‚Äù he says, with interested parties, including the security services, fiercely promoting their own narratives in the media, as well as in scholarship.

&gt;...

&gt;It wasn‚Äôt until 1991 that the services were put under nominal parliamentary oversight which, 29 years later, remains largely ineffectual. While a handful of the ancien r√©gime‚Äôs top figures were tried and sentenced in the 1990s ‚Äì and many pardoned thereafter ‚Äì most stayed in place, including the secret police‚Äôs vast networks at home and abroad. Those who left the security services went into business while remaining in a new, larger network, the historian Hodor says. The Securitate‚Äôs communist-era archives were completely closed to the public until 1999. Since then the SRI ‚Äì which to this day defends the Securitate‚Äôs supposedly noble part in the revolution ‚Äì has determined which of its 2 million files belong in the public archives. ‚ÄúThe evidence [about the revolution] is still being manipulated,‚Äù says Hodor.

Ridiculous lmao.

Women in Albania aren't baby making machines. Abortion was **ILLEGAL UNTIL 1990.**

Albania has one of the lowest fertility rates on the planet. 

&gt;In **1958, Albanian women had an average of 6.5 children** so the population exploded. Clearly no one wants to go back to that, but the last time Albania‚Äôs fertility rate was above the 2.1 level needed to replace the current population was in 2003.  
&gt;  
&gt;In **2018, it was 1.37**, which Nesturi noted was **‚Äúthe lowest rate in history‚Äù**.¬† In 1990, just as communism was collapsing, there were 82,125 births in the country and 18,193 deaths.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2018, there were only 28,934 births but 21,804 deaths, so the balance, unlike in much of the rest of the region, is still positive.

Is that a backlash in women's right? I didn't think so.

This happens all the time in politics, feel free to think about why. There are several reasons.

That said, it is not even clear the other countries would have been against it if the UK had made such a proposal within the CFP. Quite the contrary, I think it would have been met with benevolence. It is not that the UK is more evironmentally friendly than the rest of (Western) Europe.

&gt; And still, I think this change is being treated with a pretty unfair level of skepticism.

AFAI am concerned, I am jsut against this narrative ""Due to CFP the UK couldn't be more environmentally friendly (even though it  wanted), but now that it is out of the EU this is possible."" This narrative is just wrong. Fact is, the UK did not want to be more environmentally friendly before.

Germany and Italy are perfect examples, and France is really strongly adverse to any talk of secession ( or even autonomy) from regions. Spain is far from being an isolated case, it is the norm.

In fact the so called ""right to integrity"" of a country is a recognized international right and it usually takes precedent, unless there are really strong tensions at play ( like a violent war in the case of the Balkans) and minority oppression and discrimination.

4979,"Translation via Deepl:

Police were called to an apartment building around midnight for noise disturbance.

**Two temporary arrests**

Already at the apartment door the officers could hear strong noise and several voices. In the apartment they encountered at least six obviously intoxicated Britons aged between 24 and 41. None of them was wearing an FFP2 mask. Some of those present tried to escape via the balcony, according to police. Police officers were physically attacked by two others, a 24-year-old and a 41-year-old, by punching and shoving them, after which they were temporarily detained.

**Already celebrated illegally two weeks ago**

This is not the first time that the British have attracted negative attention from the police. About two weeks ago they were found together with another 14 people at a snack station in the ski area also at an illegal party. There beverages stood to the withdrawal against a payment and a couch landscape. Already at that time, the six Britons were reported for the violation of the Covid 19 measures ordinance. After the incident on Monday, they will again get a charge of this kind. The two arrested for the time being will get two charges of resisting law enforcement on top of that.

The Britons, by the way, are in the country legally, according to police. Five are registered with their main residence in Tyrol, one with a secondary residence. Some of them are probably seasonal workers.",,/r/europe/comments/llesee/britons_caught_again_at_an_illegal_party_in/gnp2amv/,59843023,1613513115

Then why is it wrong to address the issues within the muslim communities, especially when those issues can harm a lot of Europeans?

5143,"Problem is that according to scientists we cant give up nuclear now, giving up nuclear early would mean we are taking path of avoiding environmental disaster with highest risk of failing, according to scientists keeping nuclear would increase chance of success by a lot.

here is interesting read on the topic:

https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/what-does-science-say-about-the-need-for-nuclear/

at top it says mostly about america but below it talks about the world as a whole.

""Global Assessments

When scientists have modeled the ways the planet as a whole can avoid the worst effects of climate change ‚Äî and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels ‚Äî nuclear power is almost always part of the solution. In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‚Äôs 2018 special report, scientists described 85 pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, or overshooting that threshold and returning to 1.5 degrees or below by 2100.

Shindell, who was one of the coordinating lead authors on the chapter, told us that it was a rare scenario that met or mostly met the 1.5 degrees limit and didn‚Äôt have nuclear power in the mix. ‚ÄúVery few, almost none in fact, can achieve 1.5 without nuclear,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very extreme scenario that can do that. And it requires enormous gains in all the zero-carbon sources.‚Äù

A large number of scenarios expanded nuclear power, Shindell said, to around double today‚Äôs level. He estimated that 90% of the scenarios included nuclear capacity above today‚Äôs level, and just one or two scenarios phased out nuclear entirely by 2100.

There are pathways, the report says, that ‚Äúno longer see a role for nuclear fission by the end of the century.‚Äù But none include no nuclear as early as 2030 or 2050.

Because the scenarios are global, the results don‚Äôt necessarily mean that the U.S. must keep or expand its nuclear power. And the scenarios are inherently limited to the types of studies scientists do, Shindell said. Still, the IPCC findings suggest that in a broad sense, most roads to success include nuclear reactors.

Consider, too, the IPCC‚Äôs Fifth Assessment Report from 2014, which was the first to include scenarios that excluded certain technologies. In the nuclear phase out scenario, eight of nine tested scenarios were able to reach the target CO2 concentration level of 430-480 parts per million, or the equivalent of reaching 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the limitation in technology increased the median costs by 7% (see figure 6.24 and table SPM.2). The phase out assumed that existing plants could operate until the end of their lifetime, but did not allow for any new nuclear plants beyond those already under construction.

A 2013 study cited in the 2014 IPCC report used an integrated assessment model to learn what might happen globally if nations stopped building any new nuclear plants in 2020. The authors concluded it was ‚Äúin principle feasible‚Äù to transform the energy system and limit carbon dioxide concentrations to 450 parts per million. But they noted that it would require ‚Äúmassive and rapid expansion‚Äù of other low-emissions technology, such as renewables and carbon capture and sequestration.

‚ÄúThis underscores the fact that, in general, nuclear energy can be regarded as a choice rather than a necessity, and different regional and national attitudes toward nuclear energy can be accommodated,‚Äù the paper reads. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, the forced phase-out of nuclear energy by 2020 would increase the required investments into the energy system transformation and would limit future supply-side flexibility, resulting in comparatively higher costs of CO2.‚Äù""",,/r/europe/comments/lkycxs/nuclear_faces_a_lot_of_uncertainty_as_eu_green/gnna37y/,Culaio,1613483913

On the other hand there are a lot of kids growing in what are considered stable families without the parents being married. For example my parents didn't marry but I grew up with both of them at home and together until my teenage years (they stayed together like 25 years), by that time most of the married parents of my friends had already divorced since years.

Meh. To an english-speaking person, learning french opens access to similar cultures, and a whole common history. If you're english, it's hard to ignore thefrench living nearby and interacting with your country all the time.

Asian languages open the door to different worlds that you could largely ignore otherwise. You need to actively seek contact.

This has nothing to do with being anti-theist. If they were anti-theist they would have attacked the catholics and protestants, not minority groups.

This has everything to do with totalitarian regimes wanting uniformity. 

In communist Romania minority religions were banned/oppressed, while the domination of the majority christian orthodox church was enforced. Because its head was working with the communists and with the secret police. So as long as the church was part of the system, it was ok.

&gt;Are you also the type of person that would tell me ""Ugh ugh nazis were left wing and socialist cuz they had socialism in their name!!""

This is the tactic of fascists and religious people, to claim nazis were socialists/atheists in order to paint their opponents in a bad light. Literally what you are doing.

What however has some similarities is the way a certain group is being portrayed. 

The majority of the germans during nazi rule probably didn\`t even know why the Jews were being treated the way they were , they simply trusted the government to make the right decisions and get them out of a large crisis. 

I\`m not saying our government is turning into some sort of nazi regime and abusing the powers given to them during the crisis. What I am saying though, is that blindly following orders by the government during a crisis (the measures have not been very effective) comes very close to the  ""wir haben es nicht gewu√üt"" and  ‚ÄúI was just following orders‚Äù quotes you must surely know.  It was not Hitler who seized power and created a dictatorship but it was the people who willingly gave away their freedom in exchange for a promise of salvation.

Calling people who do not adhere and blindly follow and trust everything the government does 'wappies' does resemble a willingness to give way to your societal, constitutional and personal freedom to the government in the hope that they will do what needs to be done that was also present before and during the moment Hitler and his party took power.",,/r/europe/comments/ll0kf7/dutch_court_rules_that_curfew_must_be_scrapped/gnmzidw/,17716koen,1613476806
