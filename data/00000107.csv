5,"It's not really correct, though. The law said that the only heads of the family was allowed to vote. It was implied it meant man, but then a Carolina Beatriz √Çngelo challenged in courts that, since she was widowed and she provided for the family (she was a physicians) she should be considered a head of the family, and allowed to vote. She did end up voting in those elections, but the law was amended right after.

So it was not like women had equal rights it what regards to voting. Even if they hadn't changed the law, the husband would almost certainly have taken precedence a head of the family.

23,"Yes, it's quite interesting

Some 300 years ago a man named Marko resided in the small house in Bol. A large piece of land behind Marko‚Äôs place was owned by the wealthy Vukoviƒá family. The family consisted of 6 brothers ‚Äì 3 priests and 3 sea captains who owned a large ship.

The captains all sailed to Spain and eventually got married there. They decided that they would build in Bol a large palace, or as it's locally known ‚Äòpaloc‚Äô, for all their families.

The small house stood in the way of their plans but Marko would not sell his house. Negotiations turned ugly and led to a massive dispute.

The influental Vukoviƒá had connections with the town mayor at the time and after he failed to ‚Äòconvince‚Äô Marko to sell, force was used. Marko was eventually jailed but managed to escape to the Republic of Dubrovnik. When Marko left the Vukoviƒá family started to build their house by constructing¬†walls around Marko‚Äôs house, with the intent to presumbly dismantle his house later on and use it to construct the inner walls.

Marko heard about what was going on and purchased 4 barrels of gunpowder before returning to Bol to plan to blow the new place up with a group of his friends. His plans to blow the place up was foiled one night whilst he was digging holes to put the gunpowder in and Marko had to leave the town yet again.

The Vukoviƒá mansion started to take shape as they thought they finally managed toget rid of pesky Marko. When they required materials for the roof they took their ship to Venice to source the goods. The ship got into trouble on the trip with all three brothers drowning.

Because none of the other brothers (who, as it was mentioned in the beginning, were priests) had children, the family eventually died out and the house was left. Marko returned to Bol and moved back into live in his house",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/ffbadj/house_within_a_house_island_of_braƒç_croatia/fjxc7og/,Matyas11,1583667222

44,"Easiest way: by creating direct bridges for refugees to the EU. Refugees should be accepted and transported via official channels to the EU. We have seen evacuations from war zones in the past, it would be a piece of cake to organize the transport of refugees that already reside outside the danger zone.

As for now the transport of everyone to Europe takes place with the help of traffickers who of course don't have any criteria in their selection and furthermore they are responsible for many atrocities (for example:  [UN report: Majority of female migrants faced gang rape in Libya](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/report-majority-female-migrants-faced-gang-rape-libya-181220143620822.html) or [Libya slave trade](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/14/africa/libya-migrant-auctions/index.html)), atrocities for which no one seems to complain, not even organizations that supposedly support immigrants. Those organizations should be the first to protest against trafficking in favor of safe ways of transport, but it's not the case.

Now the situation is more complex because traffickers are in the game for too long. In fact, they are those who run the game. Best solution in the current situation is the rapid deportation of those who don't fulfill Geneva's Convention and Protocol's about the refugees criteria. What makes asylum abuse attractive to immigrants is the fact that deportations of failed asylum seekers takes forever and thus they stay on benefits for many years, till they get deported. If it was not so easy to abuse the asylum process, demand by fake asylum seekers would decrease considerably.",,/r/europe/comments/ff9glr/at_turkeys_frontier_with_europe_everyone_wants_to/fjxcc4w/,TravellingAroundMan,1583667389

And ~12 years after that we had our civil war. Coincidence? I don't think so.

But in all seriousness, that and our maternity care are hands down the thing I'm most proud of as a Finnish girl. Our maternal and infant mortality is one of the lowest (if not the lowest) in the world and our neuvola system is just fantastic, not to mention how wonderfully many benefits there are to raise a child in Finland.

The numbers I can find are that a 747 uses 1 gal/second, so a single excess 5-hour flight is like 18,000 gallons. Even a ~45% efficiency reduction on that for more modern planes gives 10,000 gallons per excess flight. Multiply that by however many excess flights per airline per day and then by many airlines are doing this (I dunno, let's say 5 flights for 5 airlines? though this feels generous) and suddenly you have like 250,000 gallons/day being wasted per day.

184,"Not the OP, but if I'd like to add something are the followings:

1. The propaganda is great. They say we killed people, that strip them, beat them and at the same time they provide zero eviidence. Not only that but there are videos showing the opposite, that the Turksish police are the ones beating and stripping people. To add on that there are cases where the Turkish media are orchestrating/directing cases of such events , where in some cases you can even hear the director. On the first point I made , to have a dead man, it would be the last thing the Greek state would want. 

2. Thd Turkish state has started throwing a barrage of smoke canisters and tear gas so that greek personel cannot see what is going on in the borders. Then they assist migrants in tearing down the fence, like the videos show. They also gave them money to travel here at the borders and even assist human smugglers. 

3. Erdo said that we haven't seen anything yet. He also said that migrants shouldnt eneter Greece by sea and that he will enforce this ( which means that he didnt do it up until now ) and that they should go to the Evros borders.  So the Turkish state is actively helping and guiding their efforts to enter Greece illegally. Also the Turkish Minister of Interior said that migrants should go to the south borders of Evros to simply ""walk"" to the other side. 

So the Turkish state is trying to destroy the border/fence and helping people to enter Greece illegally. I'll be Frank with you.

Up until now , the solidarity means nothing. Erdo will have a meeting with Merkel and the EU leadership to strike a deal. The German interests are a lot so they will probably back down. Also there are many Turks that serve as a leverage.

I want to make a few comments on this. I completely agree with the protesters here. The bakery decided to hire third world workers instead of increasing the wages for the locals (something EU countries in general have been doing for decades now).

&gt;""First, two enter Ditrau, then they will bring their families because they have the rights, and then they'll bring another 10,"" a moustachioed, middle-aged man told the meeting.

This bit is also true. EU laws enable them to easily help the rest of their close families move. And considering they're from Sri Lanka, it's very likely they'd even marry their cousins to bring them here (happened before).

They probably don't want to end up like Sweden, France or Germany where even in the smallest cities you can often find yourself in neighborhoods with more foreigners than locals.

You don't need to apply for a visa (aka when you fly to Turkey) before you travel because one is given to you on the point of entry. The visa tells you how long you can stay and what economic activity you can do.

Erdogan can make a play, but he did this to show that europe/greece is actually faulty in this situation and react with weapons, shooting some to death and trying to sink airboats. There are already over hundreds of thousands syrians, who made it across the border. So both parties win. Everyone who wants to go should go, because they are humans too and have to flee because europe/america supports PKK (a group which attacked and terrorized Syria and made them flee, but this happened within the east of Syria) and on the other hand we have Russia with ESAD (terrorizing and making Syrians flee from Syria within the west of Syria). If you don't accept this go to syria and fight for your own side and stop crying about it.

397,"Giuseppe Conte the President of the Council [of Ministers of Italy] has signed, in the night between Saturday and Sunday, a decree that imposes with immediate effect new restrictions on the movement of people until the 3rd of april, due to the Coronavirus emergency, in Lombardy and in some provinces of Veneto, Emilia Romagna and Piedmont. The arrival and departure from these territories is allowed only for serious and ‚Äúdemonstrated‚Äù reasons either work or family related. It‚Äôs garanteed the possibility to return home [for those living in the zone that are currently outside of it]. Those who are under [domiciliary] quarantine will not have any possibility to move. The President of the Council said that the provinces affected are: Parma, Piacenza, Rimini, Reggio-Emilia, Modena, Pesaro e Urbino, Venice, Padova, Treviso, Alessandria, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Novara, Vercelli and Asti. In total, these measures will affect more than one fourth of the entire italian population.

In the decree ‚Äì which confirms the anticipations given by the Corriere della Sera Saturday evening ‚Äì is established a ‚Äúsecurity zone‚Äù where extremely harsh limitations are imposed. In particular: The closure of all schools of every order and rank, the suspension of all public events and skiing activitis. The closure of all museums, gyms, pools, theaters, social and cultural centers. All publci [hiring] competitons will be suspended with the exclusions of the ones for healthcare workers and the telematic ones. Bars and restourants will be opened only between 6am and 6pm, and they‚Äôll have to maintain the required distance of one meter [between costumers] otherwise their activity will be suspended.

In the decree is written to ‚ÄúAbsolutely avoid every movement inside the territories [of the security zone] with the exception of mevement motivated by work necessities or emergency situations‚Äù. To those who show ‚Äúsymptoms of respiratory infection and fever of temperature over 37,5¬∞C‚Äù is ‚Äústrongly‚Äù advised to stay at home and call their family medic, immediatly limiting all social contacts. The ordinary leaves given to healthcare and technical workers are suspended, as well as the leaves given to ‚Äúthe personell whose activity is necessary to mange the requests of the emergency units established on a regional level‚Äù.

The decree also says that the commercial activities will have to maintain the required distance of one meter between costumers otherwise they will be sanctioned: if due to structural reasons they can not allow such distance they will be forced to close. In the festive and pre-festive days the middle and large sized commercial facilities will be closed, as well as the ones inside malls and markets. It‚Äôs also recommended to apply quotas for entering stores, markets, fairs in order to avoid ‚Äúgatherings of people‚Äù.

The access of parents and visitors to hospitals, hospices, emergency rooms and retirement homes is ‚ÄúLimited to only the cases allowed by the healthcare management of the structure‚Äù, which ‚Äúhas the duty to adopt the necessary measures to avoid possible infections‚Äù. Work meetings will have to be postponed and smart working will have to be encouraged. Places of worship will stay open, as long as they are able to garantee that there are no ‚ÄúGatherings of people‚Äù.

For what concerns sport, the events and competitions of every discipline and order will be ‚Äúsuspended‚Äù, ‚Äúin both public and private locations‚Äù. But in the decree it‚Äôs also said that ‚Äúit‚Äôs still allowed for said events and competitions, and the training of agonist athletes, to take place so long as the sports facilities are used behind closed doors.‚Äù More restrctions will also be imposed in all of Italy. All meetings and spectacles will be suspended, from cinemas to museums to sport activities; as well as pub, discos, bingo halls, arcades, and the lessons of schools and universities. Store will be allowed to saty open in the workdays, bars and restourants only if the have table service and garantee the security ditance of one meter between costumers.

482,"&gt; The issue wasn't with Thatcher closing mines itself,

The issue was exactly that insofar as the NUM cared at the time.

&gt; she killed that industry, and others,

How do you suppose she did so? By withdrawing the public subsidy?

&gt; replacing it with nothing.

She gave incentives for private investment but she couldn't force it.

That said, she secured Nissan for Sunderland, which did create new jobs.

&gt; but replaced it with other industry,

Other industry? Private or public ones?

&gt; training opportunities,

She too offered training opportunities to those who wished to retrain: ""[The government boasted of the **positive increase in the number of people employed and of their increasingly sophisticated efforts to provide training** and to deal specifically with the young and the long-term jobless.](https://books.google.com/books?id=D76xCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18)""

And, this was all in spite of the NUM (who actively boycotted the scheme).

&gt; and gave more generous packages to the people that were laid off. 

This is such an absolute lie. The reality was entirely the opposite:

* [**The last Labour Government provided only limited help to miners leaving the industry.** For example, men over 50 received no capital payments before 1979. Greatly improved terms have been introduced by this Government through the Redundant Mineworkers' Payment Scheme. Today a miner of 50 receives ¬£1,000 for each year of service and a percentage of his wage until retirement. For those under 50, a capital sum of ¬£1,000 for every year of service has been available. In line with the industry's commitment to return to complete financial independence the Redundant Mineworkers' Payments Scheme will end in March 1987. In its place, under the terms of the Coal Industry Act 1987 the Government will have powers to pay grants towards costs incurred by British Coal in redeploying and reducing their workforce, and the maintenance of concessionary coal and welfare arrangements.](https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/110801)

&gt; Labour doesn't get the same criticism for coal-mine closures.

They appeased the NUM until they no longer could and ergo, lost office.

She, for her part, stood up to them and took the flak as a consequence.

If that is not the case, here are the relevant numbers:

Means what it says... Nazis were willing to go to war in 1938 and French with British knew it. It was not that unreasonable in 1938 context to expect that Germans would honor agreement for at least some time.

&gt; France and Britain could've ignored Poland like thry did Czechoslovakia

If you ignore it was already after Munich Agreement which by 1939 Nazis already broke. Remilitarization of the Rheinland and Anschluss of Austria were hardly controversial since it was regarded as German matter (Austrians as seperate nationality were molded only by WW2). Sudetenland crisis was first instance in which Western Powers had some actually reasonable reason to go to war which would not be shut down by theirs' populations.

When it became apparent though that Third Reich would not stop it's expansionism, when it invaded rest of Czechoslovakia in march of 1939, appeasement stopped and Poland was given guarantees.",,/r/europe/comments/ff1la2/a_salute_to_the_red_army_royal_albert_hall_london/fjvwo8e/,ReichLife,1583631856

Enough r/europe users more than justify that victim card and I definitely don‚Äôt enjoy having to tell you people are being dicks to Turks regardless of politics or whatever. Many people on Reddit pull the victim card at us Turks too, you don‚Äôt hear me complain about that now do you? People are still complaining about Janissaries ffs.

You just don‚Äôt see that most people in Europe or elsewhere have no freaking idea about Idlib, the refugee crisis at the border, etc. Almost every time we talked about any political subjects in Europe I literally had to tell them the basics of every story.

Most people simply don‚Äôt care about politics. They aren‚Äôt on Reddit. They don‚Äôt read Reuters, or NYT or whatever. In Holland they just watched NOS (state television news) which has EXTREMELY limited coverage on such issues or just read their news on websites like nu.nl (most popular Dutch news site). 

I used Chrome‚Äôs translate tool to see what the headlines were on Dutch MSM and I was shocked by how super limited the coverage is. If there are 10 posts about a political subject on Turkey/Greece/Syria here on r/europe, there literally was one article in Dutch news sites like a month after it had been covered here on Reddit dozens of times and after hundreds of flamewars between Europeans and Turks.

Yes, people do say they regret the severed ties between our countries, but don‚Äôt really know the details and will go straight back to friendly talk the moment some good news came out.

A few days ago Turkey lifted visas for Dutch travelers to Turkey and while many Reddittors were like ‚Äúpff yeah as if anyone even wants go to evil Turkey anymore‚Äù, most of the people I know there etc. were happy and saw it as a slight improvement of ties and plan to come visit Turkey here.

581,"I honestly do not understand why you keep posting this post which is full of lies and even got deleted before in this same sub. What's your particular interest on this troll?

In any case, I'm replying you again. I want to make clear to anyone who read your post that the article is just propaganda and that that's not the way law works in Spain. BTW, this is about gender violence, no domestic violence.

 

&gt;Under the current laws, men go to jail automatically if accused, even without evidence. Men can be convicted without evidence- the only evidence required is for the woman to maintain her testimony. There doesn‚Äôt need to be any evidence of any kind. The laws only go one way- women‚Äôs violence against men isn‚Äôt included, and men have much less legal protection.

Law in Spain is very protective and we don't jail anyone without strong evidence. **That paragraph is completely false**. Gender Laws violence do not say anything about jailing anybody because that competes to a different law: the Criminal Procedure Law, which is applied to every Spaniard without any distinction (gender, race.. etc).

&gt;Women who make these accusations are given housing, a government job, and 400 euros a month

That's not true either. There are asile programs for gender violence victims. But you need to prove you are victim to get them, which needs and official report from the authorities. Truth is that many women do not get any help from the administration and there are several cases of murdered women who had already report their situation to the police and did not get any attention.

[In 2019, there were approximately 4 000 women who got some kind of economic help and 126 000 gender violence reports to the police.](http://estadisticasviolenciagenero.igualdad.mpr.gob.es/)

By the way, in that article you mention, Abascal said that 87 percent of gender-violence accusations had been dropped because there was no evidence, which is complete lie. Abascal is a far right politician know for making up his own data without not sources. Truth is that the [real data is that 30% are dropped.](http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/En-Portada/Siete-de-cada-diez-sentencias-por-violencia-de-genero-fueron-condenatorias-en-2018-)

&gt;The laws only go one way- women‚Äôs violence against men isn‚Äôt included, and men have much less legal protection.

That's not true at all either. There's a law that protects woman against gender violence because there is a social background problem behind that problem: sexism. Men who are in a dominant position and kill, abuse or harm women *because* they are woman: ""La mat√© porque era m√≠a"". This is not something new, we also have laws that that protect people of other's races and ethnics against racism and xenofobia. The fact that a laws covers a certain aspect of life doesn't mean that there are not a different law for that particular issue.

So this doesn't mean that men or white people do not have any legal protection. If a man is harmed, abused or killed or whatsoever the law protects him too. Just not the gender law because women do not attack men because their condition of being men. So the justice judges each case without considering the gender condition, and counting on each particular motivation and circumstances of each case.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ff3dq1/spains_domestic_violence_laws_called_violencia_de/fjv7j28/,Javix92,1583623907

The mandatory quarantine will last until early April.

The dramatic escalation in the country's efforts to contain the new deadly coronavirus will close gyms, pools, museums and ski resorts.
Italy is Europe's worst hit-country and reported a steep rise in virus infections on Saturday.

The new measures could take effect as early as Sunday and will last until 3 April.

The death toll in Italy has passed 230, with officials reporting more than 50 deaths in 24 hours. The number of confirmed cases jumped by more than 1,200 to 5,883 on Saturday.

The measures published in a draft government decree were obtained by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

They are set to be signed in the coming hours, reports the BBC's Mark Lowen.

The whole northern region of Lombardy, home to 10 million people and Italy's financial centre Milan, will be closed off except to emergency access, and 11 provinces including Venice, Parma and Modena will be affected.

Until now around 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantine measures.

Night clubs, gyms, swimming pools, museums and ski resorts will be closed.

Restaurants and cafes can open but customers must sit at least a metre apart.
People will be told to stay home as much as possible, and those who break the quarantine could face three months in jail.

Sports competitions will close to the public, and the president of Italy's football players' union has called for all football to stop.

The World Health Organization has advised Italy to strongly focus on virus containment measures as infections spread in the country.
Leading Italian politician Nicola Zingaretti said on Saturday he had tested positive for the virus.

""I am fine but I will have to stay home for the next few days,"" the leader of Italy's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) said in a Facebook post.

The country has said it will start recruiting retired doctors in an effort to combat the escalating outbreak.

Elsewhere, Iran has confirmed almost 6,000 infections and 145 deaths, and the number of cases worldwide has passed 10,000, officials say.

A second MP was reportedly among those to have died in Iran, where health officials fear the number of cases may actually be much higher.

There have so far been nearly 3,500 coronavirus deaths recorded worldwide. The majority have been in China, where the virus originated in December.

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has called the spread of the virus ""deeply concerning"" and urged all countries to make containment ""their highest priority"".",,/r/europe/comments/ff3s20/coronavirus_italy_to_quarantine_10_million_people/fjv9qtr/,bataneyelid,1583624611

In the context of October 1938, Munich agreement saved the continent from another Great War. Judging it just from the hindsight is very flawed approach to history since those who made decisions at that time did not have such benefit. Appeasement was seen as vialable policy and when it was realized it was not a case, it was dropped. 

This just further puts Soviets in discredited light, since despite seen that Third Reich clearly was not trustworthy state in 1939, they still opted for deal with Nazis in order to redraw the map of Eastern Europe in theirs' favour and for imperialistic goals.


&gt;And Poland was the closest Nazi's ally since 1936.

Well that's just delusional. Might want to learn what 'ally' actually means cause Non-Aggression pact does not make two states allies.

635,"&gt; Britain with France did the similar pact a year earlier in 1938 when they allowed to tear Czechoslovakia.

That was not a diplomatic protocol that partitioned Eastern Europe, it did not give them all of Czechia - just Sudetenland. They were wrong but it isn't even comparable to the secret agreement between Ribbentrop and Molotov. Britain and France did not receive any territory in compensation like Stalin did in his failed (Finland)/successful (Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) conquests between 1939 and 1941.

Poland was also not an ally either, they had their own non-aggression pact which went back to 1934 and one that *Hitler* renewed repeatedly; even just before the Danzig Crisis in August 1939. Poland retook territory in Czechia that was majority Polish.

Stalin on the other hand was obsessed about restoring the old Tsarist frontiers. Soviet territorial aggrandisement was his sole aim and one he succeeded in doing because of WWII. Stalin also shipped tonnes of raw materials to Hitler even when he invaded the Low Countries and France.

There was also conferences between the Gestapo and NKVD in Poland, at around the same time Jews were being rounded up for the Ghettos and Stalin was executing Polish officers.

And before you say sTaLin WaNtEd aN ALLianCe Chamberlain himself wrote a letter to his sister agonising about how he would get Stalin out of Eastern Europe. Either Stalin would act in good faith as an ally or he wouldn't, the latter would later prove true after the end of WWII. Consider that, in 1939, both Britain and France were convinced they could defeat Germany - it wasn't clear that France would fall in six weeks the next year so in their mind it was worth ignoring his obviously dubious proposals.

Excessive alcohol consumption has almost tripled in Ireland since 1960.

Historically the Catholic Church attempted to suppress alcoholism in Ireland by encouraging some young Catholics to swear oaths of abstinence from alcohol. It was believed this would help contain the issue of excessive alcohol consumption. Furthermore, geographical areas that had higher Catholic populrally had lower drinking rates. Higher attendance at mass was associated with lower consumption levels of alcohol.  Conversely, areas that had higher historical exposure to British culture, which a study measured by whether a town had been exposed to a game of cricket or not, tended to have higher consumption rates of alcohol. It's believed that the influence of British culture through things like sporting events promoted a drinking culture.","Dalecarlia, Sweden, Northern Europe, European Union, Eurasia",/r/europe/comments/fewk3k/why_does_europe_seem_to_have_an_extremely/fjt1ne9/,Roesztran,1583602554

In middle ages, beer was pretty much only save drink, because the water was very muddy and it caused dysentery. Just keep in mind that the beer at the time was much weaker.

Then around the XVII century, we ~~or Russians~~ invented vodka, cheap drink that the most importantly it kept poor serfs under control so of course Russian Tsars decided to that they have a monopoly on it.

In XIX c. there were some propositions for prohibition, but when the USA did it in early XX c. and it created mob cartels and more alcohol problems. So no one tried it again... except Soviets, they decided at the beginning to ban alcohol to free the peoples' minds, but yea they became the very thing they wanted to destroy - an oppressive government which crush its people but to be fair it still was better than before, but barely.

So, yeah, some countries, like China, have just taken over all existing orders for production facilities in their country.  If you're a multinational that built a factory in China, you've been told that any orders you've taken are cancelled and that now all output stays inside China.

But even countries that don't have restrictions are not gonna scale up production to be able to fill the kind of demand out there.  The spike is too big.

I was looking at US manufacturers well back in the outbreak to see what kind of output they had.  One small company, Prestige Ameritech, that I looked at then, has now come to the attention of the media.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/02/15/coronavirus-mask-shortage-texas-manufacturing/

&gt; Prestige Ameritech, the largest full-line domestic surgical mask manufacturer, was producing 600,000 masks each day but struggling to meet demand.

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/05/811387424/face-masks-not-enough-are-made-in-america-to-deal-with-coronavirus

&gt; ""I've got requests for maybe a billion and a half masks, if you add it up,"" he says. That's right ‚Äî 1.5 billion.

-

&gt; Prestige Ameritech, for example, owns a limited number of machines that assemble, sew and shape the masks. A decade ago, it ramped up production in response to the swine flu outbreak by buying more machines and hiring 150 new workers.
&gt;
&gt;""We made a really big mistake,"" Bowen says of that decision. It took about four months to build the new machines, which are as long as a school bus and cost as much as $1 million.
&gt;
&gt;By the time they were ready, the swine flu crisis had ended, demand vaporized, and Prestige Ameritech almost went bankrupt.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-face-masks-prestige-ameritech-demand/

&gt;Daily order requests since the outbreak, he said, now range from 1 to 100 million face masks and respirators, requests his small business of roughly 100 employees can't fulfill. 

At 600k masks a day at full capacity, and an order backlog of 1.5 billion, that's an existing order backlog of 7.8 years, assuming no new orders or production issues.   Plus companies and countries trying to get 1 to 100 million more each day.

And I bet that every manufacturer in the world that's allowed to export has comparable delay, because if someone goes to Prestige Ameritech and they say ""well‚Ä¶our backlog is 1.5 billion and we can put you on the end of the queue"", then you're gonna shop around and see what delay is like everywhere before getting on the end of the queue.

And I figure that even if Prestige Ameritech starts trying to get more manufacturing machines like they did with swine flu and if those machines from wherever they're made aren't subject to export bans or whatever, that those mask machine guys are probably backordered too by all of the mask manufacturers.

&gt; On Feb. 26, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar¬†told the House Appropriations Committee that the country has a stockpile of 12 million N95 masks, but according to HHS estimates, it needs 300 million to cover an emergency. Powell said the maximum annual production capacity in the U. S. and Mexico is 65 million.

And you figure that Mexico is probably gonna want some of those N95 masks too.

I mean, even if we keep exports running, it's not going to make a difference in any kind of near timeframe.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fetqbz/europe_fails_to_help_italy_in_coronavirus_fight/fjsbrmx/,duisThias,1583595503

1072,"Turkey doesnt want to escalate or start a conflict with EU and you guys don't stand calm at all. Turkey is hosting 5M+ refugees since 2011. 

Turkey wants to fair share with the EU and USA over the problems they have caused in Syria with Arab Spring. Turkey did not actively involved the arab spring that started syrian war. Turkey did not want a war its border because it obviously will cause a refugee crisis since the begining and it was right; 5M people ran to its borders for their lives because the Assad was bombimg them from the above &amp; partnering with ISIS by giving the controls of it's villages on purpose in order to make people ran to Turkey. Turkey spent 40Millions euros to refugees by giving them free healtcare, free education and many advantages that taken from it's citizens. 

For example, if you go to hospital as a Turkish citizen and there's a syrian, the syrian gets the priority and gets the healthcare before you. And free. But the Turkish person has to pay. 

Syrians started to exploit this rights by giving birth more and more childs everyday. Because it was free and they were getting more for every child they have. 

Same thing goes for other rights as well like education was free for them while Turks have to pay, etc. 

Meanwhile, Turkey was looking for solutions to stop the war in syria in order to send this people back to their countries. But Turkey can not do it by itself; It needed help from the EU but EU didn't care at all. President Erdogan insisted to create a safe zone in syria so there can be a de-escalated zone sanitized from the terrorist organisations, assad's army. So they signed agreements with Russia in sochi. But nor assad neighter russia did not act according to the agreement. 

Then Turkey decided to start an offensive called 'operation peace spring' the idea was to clean 40KMX200KM area from the armed terrorist groups so this people can go to their country and get their life to normal. 

But Turkey called as 'terrorist' for conducting such an operation in Syria. All Turkey wanted to send this people back to where they can actually live. Without the safe zone, It would be send them back from where they ran for their lives and it would be send them to a certain death because Assad is still in charge and its army still bombing their home and there's still refugee groups coming Turkey borders as their villages is bombed &amp; demolished, their families killed and their village taken by the ISIS and the man who those people doesnt want to be in charge. 

On the other side, With the acts of EU and US to this operations, Turkish people started to think this is a planned project by US &amp; EU to broke up our national rights, broke our demography, make us hate from our nation, start another civil war so we can be easly invaded in the future. Like syria. Otherwise why would they want to war keep going and refugees to flow inside our country, right? think about it. 

Turkey wants to stop the war in syria send refugees because it destroys our nation too. To somewhere else? ok. To their home in syria? better. 

Meanwhile, Everybody in eu, hates us and calling us with vile names for requesting eu people to put their hands under the rock and find a solution in syria and stop the war, send people back in their home. 

No one can understand better than Turkish people what it's like to host 5M+ unemployed, non-qualified people with no money and nowhere to go. 

EU's solution was sending money Turkey for refugees and they gave us as a solution to everything; Yes, it was a solution but works only for them; Not us. So the money wasn't the solution and Erdogan knew it. 

He opened the doors to shut our months for a while and give us something else to talk about so we can forget our 39 son's died in Syria while trying to achieve the thing that gives us nothing. 

No one in this reddit can hate him more than i do. But Turkey isn't all about Erdogan; There are 90M people and its %85 was living under the poor standarts and they can't take care of this people anymore. 

EU people shouldn't hate Turkish people for wanting their life back.

1180,"&gt; We were always told that the great depression in the 1930s lead to the implementation of welfare in European countries. See, the NSDAP (Hitler's political party) could only gain this many votes in the 1930s because they became unemployed and if you are unemployed and you don't get any welfare, well.. You will pretty much starve to death - which is something most people don't like so they just joined the most radical parties (on the left the communist party and on the right the Nazis) because they promised that as soon as they get elected, they will magically make all kind of poverty disappear. 

Interesting. The thing is we had a similar experience(IMF), and our conclusion was complete opposite. Our competition obsession become prominent after IMF because it spawned public distrust of government. Korean started to tell their children there is nobody to believe other than themselves, thus you must secure the power or be subject to whim of  upper classes.  I am actually somewhat depressed since almost every event occurred in Korea lead to anti-government which is huge obstacle to install proper welfare system.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The other thing (I am going to assume) is that in east Asia your job and your degree is super important to your social status. In Switzerland, not so much. As long as you are not unemployed and as long as you are not earning money by doing criminal stuff, people won't judge you that much. You became a garbage man? Well that's great! You have a surprisingly high salary and a guaranteed job. You are working as a construction worker? Good for you! You must be proud of yourself at the end of the day when you see that you have build something with your own hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

Payment of those jobs are not really bad in Korea, but the problem is that parents always find excuse to discourage children who try to pursue physical labor.  First thing they mentioned is social status as you said, but another main concern is that physical labor have more danger compared to other jobs. Korea had sacrificed safety for rapid economic development.  Parent generation had seen many death of workers in accidents, not refusing to expose their children in such danger. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for explanation. After reading your comment, I guess these mentality(disdaining blue collar jobs and distrust in government) is a price for our rapid growth. Our parent ancestor had paid a price for economic growth in physical struggle. Maybe, my generation is also sacrificing for social growth in future generation by harboring such mentality.",,/r/europe/comments/fel4gq/cultural_exchange_with_rkorea_come_and_join_us/fjr2i69/,Orderswrath,1583580649

The US government considers the costs and risks WRT dealing with the Ukraine situation to be acceptable.  I'd say that they're the best ones in a position to make that call, and don't see a reason to second-guess them.

My guess is that the US government probably does not anticipate sanctions to significantly alter the dollar's international role.

1636,"The Black Death skipped certain parts of Europe - and that could be a lesson for today's coronavirus epidemic

&amp;#x200B;

06 March, 2020

Why were Milan, Poland and a few other places spared the worst of the Black Death?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Calm down, we're not comparing COVID-19 to the Plague.

Well, not literally. But this map raises an interesting question: Why were some parts of Europe spared of the Black Death?

And can that tell us something about where the coronavirus will or won't spread?

The doctor will see you now

&amp;#x200B;

Engraving of 'Doctor Schnabel' ('Dr. Beak'), a plague doctor in 17th-century Rome, wearing the typical mask with which caregivers sought to keep the 'bad air' at bay that they held responsible for the spread of the disease.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Black Death was a ruthless killer ‚Äì and, if you were lucky, a swift one. Its more fortunate victims ""ate lunch with their friends, and dinner with their ancestors in paradise,"" wrote Giovanni Boccaccio, who lived through the initial wave of the Plague as it struck Italy in the 1340s.

&amp;#x200B;

What does that have to do with the coronavirus? Not a whole lot, fortunately. Except that the brief of this little corner of the internet is to look for strange maps, and one map led to another.

&amp;#x200B;

The Plague was brought from China to Europe in the 1330s by rodents hitching rides with traders. The infection with the Yersinia pestis bacterium was typically transmitted to humans by fleabites. The Plague's three manifestations were bubonic (causing painful swellings), septicemic (infecting the bloodstream) and pneumonic (choking off breathing, and transmittable via coughing). Left untreated ‚Äì as was necessarily the case in the Middle Ages ‚Äì bubonic plague had a mortality rate of about 50%, for the other two, it's virtually 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bocaccio's Italy was hit hard by the epidemic. Cities like Venice and Pisa lost three-quarters of their population. The disease followed the traditional trading routes north, racing forward each spring as a new generation of fleas was ready to spread the infection.

&amp;#x200B;

The Plague afflicted most of Europe in a relatively brief period. It's estimated that it killed as many as 25 million ‚Äì a third of Europe's population at the time ‚Äì in just five short years.

&amp;#x200B;

Absent explanations and remedies, Europe's populations turned to God for hope, and victimized outsider groups as scapegoats. Some of Western Europe's worst anti-Jewish pogroms before WWII took place during outbreaks of the Plague.

&amp;#x200B;

Plague's progress

The Black Death spread rapidly along the major European sea and land trade routes. Spread of bubonic plague in medieval Europe. The colors indicate the spatial distribution of plague outbreaks over time. Spread of plague in the 1340s: 1347 mid-1348 early-1349 late-1349 Areas that escaped with minor plague outbreak. The migration of the Black Death across Europe.

In just a few years, the Plague had moved from its entry points on the Mediterranean as far north as Scandinavia.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First afflicted (in 1347) were Asia Minor, and the islands of Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, with just small bridgeheads on the European mainland: Marseilles and environs, Calabria (the tip of Italy's shoe), and the southern shore of what is now Turkish Thrace (i.e. European Turkey).

By the next year (1348), the disease had achieved a firm foothold in Europe, reaching as far as the gates of Toledo and Paris.

In early 1349, the Plague had overwhelmed London and Frankfurt, and was poised to pounce Vienna and Bucharest. Later that year, it reached as far as Ireland and Norway.

Its relentless march north continued. In 1350, it hit L√ºbeck and Copenhagen, reaching high into Norway. In 1351 and thereafter, it swept further north, touching the entire continent.

The Black Death has left deep traces in European history. To this day, √∏deg√•rd ‚Äì 'deserted farm' ‚Äì is a fairly common place name in Norway, to name just one example.

But as this map indicates, the Plague spared certain areas (marked green on the map) on march of destruction:

an area in Italy centered on Milan;

small, contiguous parts of Spain and France, on either side of the Pyrenees;

an area in the Low Countries around Bruges;

a large area in Eastern Europe, stretching from Magdeburg to beyond Warsaw, taking in most of present-day Poland, plus some surrounding areas.

Why? First off, the map is slightly misleading. Green does not mean 'safe', just 'less deadly'. Milan, for example, only lost about 15% of its population. Horrific by today's standards, but a mere trifle compared to the almost wholesale extinction of Italy's other cities. In Poland and the other 'green' areas too, people did die of the Plague, albeit in much lower numbers than elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One main reason why Poland escaped relatively unscathed, was the decision by Poland's king, Casimir the Great, to close the country's borders ‚Äì and set up internal quarantines.

&amp;#x200B;

This increased Poland's natural isolation, both from the outside world and between the settlements within the country ‚Äì generally smaller and less connected than elsewhere in Europe. Prague to Krakow took eight days on horseback. People infected took between 24 to 72 hours to get sick. So the issue would 'resolve' itself well before the danger reached the Polish border.

&amp;#x200B;

Isolation plus quarantine certainly helped spare Poland from the worst of the epidemic. One more spurious explanation is that Poland had more cats than other parts of Europe, and thus less disease-carrying rats‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

Milan's significantly lower mortality rate may also be down to the city's stricter quarantine measures: The houses of infected families were simply bricked up (with the infected left to die inside).

&amp;#x200B;

Like Poland, the French-Spanish area, corresponding to the then-kingdom of Navarre, may have benefited from its relative isolation. Why the area around Bruges ‚Äì then a thriving port with connections to the Mediterranean ‚Äì might have been spared, is more of a mystery.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what's the lesson, if any? Isolation definitely helps against infectious diseases. But that's about the only advantage of being isolated. Take this map of the spread of COVID-19 as of 11 am on 5 March. If you had to divide the world into 'fun' and 'no fun' halves, they would correspond quite well with the blue and grey zones on this map, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, one sure-fire way to limit your exposure to the outside world is to have a bloody civil war ‚Äì see Yemen, Libya and Syria. Another is to be a destination as out of the way and unconnected as Paraguay, the Central African Republic or Mongolia.

Its not even that we dont have a problem with immigrant criminality, but we have to look at why that is, because just acting like europeans arent capable of much worse is ridiculous when you look back a little in history.

I can tell you in Germany some of the problems come from, e.g. that from the 70ies until the 90ties refugees werent allowed to work and migrant children only had 6 years of mandatory school.

And for the last years, most refugees in Germany came from countries like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia and Turkey.

Scroll a little down there, theres ""Asylberwerber nach Herkunftsl√§nder"" ( asylum seekers by origin), you can even click through the years.

Nobody cant tell me that most people from that countries arent legit refugees and in half of the countries our war mongering there is part of the reason.

But r/europe isnt about reason on this topic, everyone is talking about how every refugee is an economic immigrant, that they dont belong here and fit in our culture ( like turkish and greek culture are a lot closer than greek and german culture but nobody cares), how when we would treat them like human beings they would come in millions and millions, and how our border is way to weak and we do to little about the problem ( Germany pays the south sudan regime hundreds of millions to stop refugees there, but right now there are protests in south sudan too that may lead to another civil war with more refugees).

Im not saying there are no problems, there definitely are, but theyre not nearly as black and white as people like to claim.

A few days ago a UN first reception center was burned down, but nobody here cares about that, it doesnt fit the narrative, you take the refugees as scape goat to get your fucked up right wing policies going. Look at Hungary, they took a few hundred refugees last year but talk about refugees all the time, while repressing free learning at universities, decreasing the independency of judges, censoring state media by making certain topics need a permission first and completely prohibiting sources like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

Right now they even want to introduce books of hungarian nationalists from the 1930ies as mandatory school curriculum, dont forget there that Hungary was on the Axis side until Fall 1943. Imagine if every school kid in Germany would read ""Mein Kampf"".

The same latitude doesn't equate to the same climate -- it's just one input.

Landmasses -- especially arid landmasses -- see more-extreme temperatures than do bodies of water.  Europe is *mostly* near water, whereas the central US or central Asia is pretty far away from water; they see larger temperature extremes.

The presence of water and air and wind currents is also a factor.

1702,"Used to get high off of this stuff years ago before it became a widespread thing. They're small aluminium canisters filled with 'laughing gas'. Use it with a 'can' that's meant for a pastry mixture, then attach the canister to the top, the carbon monoxide mixes with the fluid in the can and it thickens, creating whipped cream. Mostly something used by professional bakers when making pastries and  pies and that sort of stuff. 

However seems like some people figured out you can get high off of this shit, much like there are other 'crafty' ways to get high off of everyday items. Due to the monoxide mixing in, the 'exit' of the can freezes to low temperatures so it'll be like dry ice. Attach a balloon or something else to 'catch' the monoxide so you can inhale it, since it's stupid as shit to hold your mouth over it. Inhale and exhale until you're done. Basically it gives you a very heavy and intense high for a short moment by cutting off oxygen to the brain whilst letting your body believe you're breathing co2. Apparently the effect is similar to what you feel when you're drowning. 

Such cans aren't expensive and fairly commonplace. Third party markets are around, selling so-called 'crackers'. Similar in the use of said cans, but without the container for the mixture, small and concealable. Due to it not being classified as a drug, it's pretty much widely available and bars and nightshops and they make a killing off of it, hence the reason it's being more commonplace. Most despicably is that there's no age-check. I've seen teens that weren't of legal drinking age being able to buy a 'hit' from nightshops here in the city. 

It's a perfect office drug, really. But it's incredibly damaging.

This shit has been very commonplace in the city i live for years, but i've seen it becoming more common around the country and the rest of Europe the last few years.

2. let them seek asylum from their home countries

3. if asylum is accepted, let them fly to their asylum hosts, its that simple.

edit: also for christs sake stop cutting foreign aid to pay for the asylum seekers, like Sweden did, what Sweden does is really not humanitarian because the money is much more efficiently used as foreign aid.

reducing foreign aid to help pay for the few that reaches Sweden is humanitarian populism.

2044,"How can one think that laws centering on the sanctity of human life can be abused? How is being hindered from drowning a ""reward""? Seriously, how can you look yourself in the mirror with logic like this?

Those laws were made under worse circumstances and challenges we have today, in a Europe shattered by war and with states barely even able to feed itself, not to speak of millions of refugees. Dont try and claim the situation was worse or different now, thats bullshit and you know it. 

They are based on empathy because people saw what was happening around them and decided that there are lows we never should go to, that our common humanity necessitates rules that guarantee we have to help each other out of crisis situations, in this case the danger of death at sea. Thats why those rules where made.

And newsflash: You dont get to ignore laws because others do pal.

As you said, those laws exists to protect not just people, but HUMANS. In general. All people. You and me. Just because you dont like the people you do to get to ignore those laws. Just because the turks shit on them you dont get to either. In fact not saving people in this situation is a fucking crime for good reasons.

We both know that maritime law regarding saving people in dangerous situations at sea has shit all to do with migration policy, where those people end up or get transferred to later. 

Again: you literally can not abuse human rights law based on saving human lives. If we guarantee everyones right to live as a human right we dont get to choose who has the right to be saved and who not, even every idiot who swam out to far has a right to be saved. 

That has nothing to do with immigration law- for example if those people get send back later. 
The fact that you decide intentionally to mix them up and rather let a few people drown is disgusting. That you preemptively declare people as illegal immigrants without due process which btw for a state is illegal in itself is disgusting.

Dont claim to be able to ignore human rights law to your liking and then turning around to justify it by declaring people as illegal- thats just pure hipocrisy.

We don't have competent people in power that can develop a country, going full green would be economic suicide. Developed nations are in a position in which they can trade economy for green projects, we aren't. Of course that's what the european funds are for, but when our politicians don't use them since it's hard to make corruption deals out of them, then what's the point? You can also recycle to help the country, but a lot of it will go back to the same trash pile, we don't have a solid recycle system. The best thing you can do atm is vote competent pro-EU people that would use the europeans funds to meet the target of the future european green deals.

I have yet to have any issues with the Police, they always dealt with me with greatest respect. I am also a concealed carry in IL.
Those are specific cases, mostly happening in gang ridden areas, where they typically try to bring profits back to mexico from drug, weapon sales etc. 
Most democrat states try to ban guns, for the most stupid reasons... they either lack complete idea what they are talking about, or are politically evil. Any case, the support for anti-gun laws is mainly present in big cities, while outside of them - its the opposite whether the state is in control of democrat or republican. One that is common that a lot of people run emigrate away from states, and cities that do anti-gun policies, or fight them in courts and win.

The US is still with everything bad that's been happening like Patriot Act, Obama etc. USA is still the most free country in the world. Still a beacon of hope, and liberty for all humanity. (I didn't hear people in HongKong chant EU or any country in europe or world beside that of USA - i think that clearly shows the ultimate truth.)

I do fully understand what i'm writing. 
The polish law is not ""shall issue"" its per voivodeship police head to decide whether you get it or not. In terms of ability to defend yourself - thats another big no; The polish courts from what i've read does not allow for self-defense, or required defense . They have put many people in jail or fined for defending themselves, and their loved ones. (even though law should allow them to do so.)

The ""sports"" firearm license does not give you ability to carry. For that you need additional permit which again you may or most likely may not get at all - as you need to prove there's immediate danger to your life.

2475,"&gt;Conscription, for example, just shouldn't exist for men or women. Broadening it to include women doesn't really solve anything but just makes it a problem for more people.

You say this with the idea that conscription is a problem in itself but that's a subjective opinion. Broadening conscription to include women would solve the inequality that currently exists within serving the state.

I don't think conscription is a bad thing per se, in fact I think ultimately it is one of the best ways for a country to organize defending itself... but it has its hurdles with ineffective organizing, outdated structure and inequality(not just gendered, but within genders too).

I don't think having career military is a thing to strive for as an ideal in a perfect world. We should strive towards relevant military education for all(or the majority) of the population so that willing people have the capability to defend the country when needed - and when done correctly, this should act as a deterrent for any aggression towards your country. Maintaining a paid war machine military is ineffective without conflicts and in my opinion leads to more conflicts - think military-industrial complex problems.

Of course, I come from Estonia and I'm sure many people here would love to see conscription abolished. I'm still a supporter, but I do think big reworks are needed to maintain conscription that is fair, righteous and ultimately also equal.",,/r/europe/comments/fearl4/the_eu_released_its_gender_equality_mensboys_gaps/fjmw77w/,paskaak,1583487034

2513,"By the way r/jivatman, I just looked up the Macron quote on different values - it was related strictly to the child-separation policy that, in my opinion, was a step in the wrong direction and has since been revoked and will not be applied.

That said, I don't think Macron (or me, for that matter) would deny a sovereign country the right to set its own immigration policy. I completely understand any measures the US might take to stem the inflow of unwanted immigration - there is nothing wrong with closing the border, referring possible asylum seekers to appropriate channels, even deporting people who are not supposed to be inside the country. Those are all measures applied by the EU and I don't believe for one moment that political leaders would speak against them.

The whole discussion in EU started when a large number of migrants crossed an indefensible border into Europe, and border countries could not cope with them, so a distribution mechanism was proposed to share the burden. The EU has long been applying a returns policy, but the big problem is that people who arrive often won't tell you where they came from - so there is nowhere to return them. Another huge returns problem is that even if you find out they came from, say, some central African country, that country will not take them back and you have to bribe it heavily (cf Dutch and their foreign aid). On top of all that you have the principle of non-refoulement, i.e. you cannot legally return people into a country where they might face death (like, a war zone)... So it's not that EU and US have vastly different views on immigration, it's just we have a very different situation and your current administration was a little heavy-handed about some measures.",,/r/europe/comments/fdu8p9/turkey_deploys_1000_police_at_greek_border_to/fjmwgmz/,PropOnTop,1583487421

You sorta answer your own question by saying:

&gt;A young European man is *more* disadvantaged than his female peers today, I‚Äôd argue, by virtually every socioeconomic marker. 

That simply isn't the case. Most positions of power are still held by men, as the link you included in the OP shows. Women often do earn less, even working the same job and choices made predominantly by women (such as focusing on family over their career) are less supported by society and affect all women.

I'm not saying there aren't issue that only (or predominantly) affect men, but those aren't necessarily men's issues. 

Conscription is bad for everyone and the solution is to abolish it, not expand the people who need to do it. The pension age is a labor issue and should be fought as such, otherwise you end up with higher pension ages for everyone.

I‚Äôd disagree. Most men are MOT in power, so that argument doesn‚Äôt apply to the vast majority of men. Men are less likely to be educated, less likely to to be employed, and in the young generation, young men earn less.

""The Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office has asked Switzerland through a rogatory commission to formally learn about the investigation that the Swiss justice follows for an alleged millionaire donation from a Panamanian foundation linked to King Emeritus Juan Carlos I to an account of Corinna Larsen, as the newspaper has advanced. it is

The request for information on anti-corruption occurs after the Swiss Public Prosecutor's Office did the same with the Spanish Public Ministry. This exchange of information has taken place because Anticorruption keeps proceedings open for an alleged crime of international bribery in the construction of the AVE to Mecca and Switzerland suspects that this could be the initial origin of the funds that ended up in Corinna's hands.

The Prosecutor of the Swiss city of Geneva investigates King Emeritus Juan Carlos I who, as published on Friday by the Swiss newspaper Tribune de Gen√®ve, would have received in 2012 a donation of 100 million dollars (almost 90 million euros at the current exchange rate) for part of the environment of the then king of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah bin Adbul Aziz Al Saud, in an account of the Swiss bank Mirabaud in Geneva.

In turn, the Spanish king emeritus would have donated part of that money - some 65 million euros - to which at the time was his lover, the aristocrat and businesswoman Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein - now called Corinna Larsen - as The newspaper El Pa√≠s advanced on Tuesday.

The documentation that was found in the records ordered by the Swiss prosecutor in the offices of the fund manager Arturo Fasana and the lawyer Dante Canonica, alleged foremen of Juan Carlos I and both linked to the alleged corporate plot, would endorse that donation of the emeritus king.

After this information was made public, Corinna Larsen's own lawyer has acknowledged through a statement that the businesswoman received a millionaire donation from the then king of Spain in 2012, a ""gift"", in her words, for her and her son for the ""love"" that Juan Carlos had for them.""",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/fea6jr/the_spanish_anticorruption_prosecutor_asks/fjmre7x/,Toc_a_Somaten,1583480615

Scotland could try and unilaterally declare, no one would recognize it because despite your feelings about Brexit pretty much everyone if forced to pick is going to choose maintaining their relationship with the UK over forming a new one with Scotland.

Scotland's EU entry would be vetoed by Spain if they tried it. No one would recognize their sovereignty, so that's no international relationships nor ability to form them, therefore no trading arrangement while investors withdraw their money from the newly dangerously unstable Scotland.

Meanwhile the UK legally suspends the Scottish Parliament and resumes direct rule from Westminster, they're fairly supported in this as even most independence supporters don't want a unilateral declaration.

While I generally agree with your comment, I would be more circumspect with this one. Who are ""they""?

Many smaller European nations don't really have global ambitions and ""controling Middle East"" or ""stopping Russian expansion over Middle East"" is very, very low priority for them, or they even oppose the idea. NATO is perceived as defense alliance by them, not an alliance to control the world. 

And even in larger nations, significant portion of voters is probably against NATO controlling Middle East.

On the other side, smaller European members not being kicked out at will is a very high priority for these nations. And many have somewhat influential connection to their US diasporas and would consider this one utmost diplomatical priority.

Also consider this fact that we europeans tend to conviniently sidestep every time this topic is brought up. Why is it that Iran is an oppressive theocracy today? Why is it that the Kurds have to flee from ethnic prosecution because they're split among countries that don't want them there? Why is it that Afghanistan and Iraq are active warzones? Why is it that every time a stable and ""for the people"" government pops up in Africa, its inmediately deposed by some general with ""untraceable"" funding?

Western powers, and our incessant need to play god with the lives of the citizens of other countries is one of the main, if not THE main reason these people HAVE to flee from their homelands. You talk about ""obligations"" behind the commodity of a screen, but if you were starving and had no hope for a future because the resources or the location of your country are just too much for the powers that be to pass up, you'd be doing just what they are.

Which brings to my original point: empathy, the one fucking thing that never seems to stick with people.

That being said, it's a very misleading term. When you hear the term right-wing terror, the first thought many people have would be Nazis and the like.
However a substantial amount of right-wing crimes in Germany are foreign conflicts between Kurds, Turks, Israelis, Russians, Polish etc.

German nationalism is also an issue, I'm not denying that, but these very polar motivations are lumped into the same category. [This study](https://uni-bielefeld.de/ikg/daten/JuPe_Bericht_April2017.pdf) quotes that about 81% of antisemitic crimes in Germany are by Turks, Arabs etc.
However, numbers differ from study to study. Some even quotr the direct opposite. But that just shows how subjective the data is.

2921,"Okay. I'll give you a fair chance to reflect on what you're saying. You're not much younger than me, so let me be open and try to reason with you.

1. The only thing you claim here that's really happening is them getting child support, but only if they are a confirmed refugee under the geneva convention. That is their right if they have a permanent home here. That's like criticising the state for paying child support to parents of people I don't like. That's nice and I may do that, but it's not going to change anything, because it's their right to get payed child support. Don't think authorities want to do that, they'd stop if they could. But they can't. 

You're over-generalizing on the topic of licenses. The only way any refugee (remember, not asylum-seekers waiting on confirmation on their status as refugees, who get nothing, but refugees under geneva convention) is getting their license paid for by the state is under the same conditions a person born in germany gets it paid - if they are in search of a job at a job-seeking program and a possible license would be a necessity for them to get access to a regular job. 
Regarding phones, that's a straight-up conspiracy theory. You know why most people who seek shelter from war and religious/political extremism have nice phones? Because that's literally their only way of communication with the rest of their family, their friends, their spouses, and ultimately, the part of their life before having to flee. That's why they buy nice phones - because if they should break, they lose everything they've ever had before.

The thing regarding age is another conspiracy, based on true occurrances in the beginning. Imagine this. When the first massive wave of refugees hit in 2015, nobody was prepared for it. The BAMF (""Bundesamt f√ºr Migration und Fl√ºchtlinge"" - federal office for migration and refugees) was the least prepared. Now, imagine lacking skilled translators to otherwise unusual (as in, rare in Germany) languages. And that shortage spans the whole country. While a million refugees are seeking shelter in 2015 in Germany alone. How do you actually find out someones age, then? How do you find out their nationality? Those are questions that needed an immediate solution, because the waiting lines wouldnt get shorter by not solving the cases. Therefore, they improvised in a situation where it was basically obvious that no ""right"" outcome could be found. This has since been fixed.

Okay. The problem with you feeling so attacked for thinking that is that most of what you say is factually incorrect. It just isn't true, except for very specific points under extremely specific circumstances (licenses). 

Your way of argumentation is extremely polarizing and based on stereotypes. It's very hard to see anything in your argumentation except for hate for people who are fleeing from literal bombs blowing up their houses, and their families with them. Hating on people from different nationalities than yourselves for them being part of said different nationality is extreme right politics, and in opposition to the german constitution - nobody may be discriminated against for their origin or country of birth. If you don't want people calling you that, then stop arguing on the same level as far-right politicians do.

Now, let's take a look at the ""Nie wieder Deutschland"" (-&gt; never again germany)- calls on demonstrations. What has to happen so that the youth develops that much hate against something? Well, it's easy. Politics has failed the youth. You should be aware of that. Climate changes big consequences are just about to start, renewable energies are still not used enough, people are fleeing from war and being attacked wherever they look for shelter, or they drown on the way there. Lobbyists for pharmacy pay enough so that glyphosate is allowed in the EU, even though Monsanto just had a trial in the US for Glyphosate being a very possible cause of cancer. The world is burning to the ground and nobody above the age of 30 seems to give the slightest fuck. And youth nowadays is braver than 10 years ago. They realised they needed to start stepping up to the table and call their wants out loud, because otherwise, people wouldn't listen. That's why they are angry, because they feel their future is being taken, when we could've easily dealt with all the worlds problems 15 years ago. That's why they shout ""Nie wieder Deutschland"". Because germany is a paradise for people who don't want progress, in an era where it is needed more than ever before. Otherwise, this world is going to end before nowadays youth will get to grow old. That's what germany stands for, and that's what they hate. And hey, can you really be mad at them? I can't. They've got a point, the generations before them decided to ruin the planet as much as they could for profit, and they are ans will be the ones suffering for it.

Anyone familiar with how many so called studies are done know that funds are provided by some organisation or the state and very often the agenda is already on the table.

On reading the report a case in Greece is mentioned where one woman (""who was known to hold right wing beliefs"") shot her neighbour. In Germany a gay man was killed by his 'friends'.

On the one hand you're kinda right, in that there isn't different police forces for handling different terrorists: eco-terrorists, right-wing, jihadis, it's all the same crime.

But on the other, knowing their motivations helps with a) deradicalising attempts, and b) identifying at-risk groups who might be pushed over the edge to commit crimes.

And the trends are often more useful than the exact figures. In ""The West"" we see that right-wing terrorism is now the most deadly and the most numerous of the terrorist crimes since 9/11 (which is itself a real outlier that skews all other data). 

This is possibly even downplayed further due to the US basically treating things differently if you're white - ""you can't be a terrorist if you're white"".

The whole Russian navy is pretty much a meme in the sense that it's still a capable navy but has deteoriated quite a bit since the 90s. As we both know the Russian navy is split into many fronts and thus their B+ navy is weakened even further. Something which has been a problem for a while.

Obviously as you mentioned the R&amp;D it remains to be seen whether Turkish arms industry can grow to rival its competitors. Turkey has a lot of potential but it's constantly marred by bad economical developments.

Most Europeans are just frustrated with how things have been going recently as can be seen from the sub. It just sort of feels like we've been pushed around by Russia and the US and now Turkey joined in. At the same time our second largest economy and first or second strongest military power just left the EU. So it has been setback after setback tbh. Things've just reached a boiling point with this.

I don't think any of Turkeys neighbours would invade it because that would be completely retarded as far as politics goes. What I meant was to display that in the current climate Turkey doesn't have many friends if any around it. That might change in the future but it is how it is, this is why I've found the current developments quite baffling. What's the point of doing this to the EU?

The point of the EU is to allow the EU member states to create EU-wide standards. If member state can decide individually that they don't want to accept the standard, it's no longer a standard. It's exactly the same as national standards, but on a larger scale.

So the full process goes something like this:

* EU member states agree in treaty negotiations that they're better off creating EU-wide standards on some issue X rather than individual national standards. If they don't agree, it doesn't happen.

* they write into the next treaty that X is now an ""EU competence"", which means they all agree to make legislation governing X via the EU, either in whole or in part

* if the treaty is passed by all countries, X is now an EU competence

* the Commission starts looking at X and with input from the member states, the EU Parliament, and public consultations, eventually either proposes some legislation about X or, if there's insufficient agreement from the member states or the Parliament, doesn't

* the Council and the Parliament either pass the legislation in question, or don't if either the member states or the parliament can't accept the legislation

* if the legislation is passed, it either takes effect directly (regulations governing trade, usually) or by being passed into national legislation (directives). Regulations are generally technical, and of very limited scope, directives are broader, but are usually open to national interpretation as long as they fulfil the general purpose of the directive.

Note that there are a lot of options here for member states to disagree with what's happening and change, slow, or stop legislation happening about X. As a general rule, the EU makes as little new legislation as it can get away with. A lot of its legislative output is amending its previous legislation.

If a country now decided (under, say, a new government) that it was simply going to rewrite the national legislation governing X to its own preferences without any reference to the EU legislation, it will be in breach of the treaty obligations it is signed up to, and the EU will take a case against it. It does so because, as said, for something to be an EU standard, every EU member state has to do it similarly (although not necessarily identically). If the government wants to continue to benefit from membership, it has to adhere to the rules, otherwise after a while there won't *be* any benefits to membership.

Note that the EU doesn't have the power to *overturn* national law, or amend it. What it does instead is essentially sue for breach of treaty and leave it up to the country how it goes about dealing with that. The country can go on paying the fines, seek a stay (derogation), or amend its own legislation. In some cases the country simply puts the necessary legislation on the books, then ignores it - the EU doesn't have national enforcement powers, so the most it can do is (eventually) investigate whether the rule is being enforced by the national government and then tell the national government to do something or face fines.

So, no, the EU isn't a federal system with the EU bodies able to over-rule the the national ones. It's better viewed as a contractual framework for the countries to make law jointly, with the EU bodies there to ensure that everyone sticks to their agreements once they're made. That's part of why the EU comes across as so technical / legal / bureaucratic rather than what we're used to in politics, because its function *is* technical / legal / bureaucratic. It's a joint-standard making body, not a federal government, and the standards made jointly have to supersede national ones, or it's pointless making them in the first place.",Ireland/EU,/r/europe/comments/fdugwq/europeans_treasure_their_union_and_are_not/fjkzkok/,Bowgentle,1583437013

Additionally you throw in an insult on very low level - not nice.

The constitution was written by people who has just finished fighting war gainst tyrant, oppressive British government. It is a common sense a law. It should be respected for what it is - it is a document that grants liberty to the people.

The Europe common sense gun laws are to strip people from them. Make  people dependent on the government, and weak. Disallowing them to defend themselves, and their loved ones - sometimes punishing them with fines if they hurt the assailant. 
The so called common sense law of europe resulted in nothing more but granting government more power, while stripping any kind of weight behind their citizens, while also diminishing their citizens rights, like one for example privacy. Gov is not afraid for what it does, while our is afraid - scared shtless when stuff like that gets out.

Governments should be afraid of their people, not the other way around.   Today most of the governments in europe are not afriad of their people, and they trample all over their people. If you do not see that, you should take some soap to your eyes, and look twice what has happened in past 15-20 years.

I would also like to note that first steps that Prussians and Russians did when they sliced poland was taking away all kinds of arms from the Polish population - so it would be defenseless against their aggressors, then when Germany made itself 3rd Reich first steps it took was taking away weapons from their citizens as a ""common sense"" law.

I have provided sources in other posts, if you were intelligent enough then you wouldn't use so cheap arguments asking me for sources because the information is available to anybody who has a mind of his own.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Management consultancies tend to be specialized and have multiple clients yes... 

&amp;#x200B;

No the club or rome is not a management consultancy. It's a global organization and it's impossible that a girl like greta would get that support unless she worked for them!.

You attempts to deflect are getting pathetic. You are truly dishonest person, but nothing new up there right?. That's what you do, deception and concealing information. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Then post the original source FFS. There's something called cherry-picking where you take real information out of it's original context to distort the original message, often rendering it completely wrong. You know, like implying there's an issue that a 15 YO became interested in the climate issue through someone else. I mean, yeah, how else would it have happened? That a random sculptor got Greta interested is obviously a good thing, not an issue! 

&amp;#x200B;

You are the one constantly manipulating and deceiving and distorting the original context of the information. It is obvious that greta thunberg is being used by the PR company we don't have time. But you come here with that malevolent and dishonest actitud manipulating everything. Is everybody so sneaky and evil upthere?!. 

The interview was a transcription and you can listen to that in the link I privided which is the real interview done in the swedish SVT radio.  I am not posting it for you, I am sure normal people can see that fakeness. So you will lose ;-)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**P4 radio: Tell about your connection to Greta's school strike and what happened afterwards**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bo thoren: The link is that last year I worked on mobilizing young people in the climate issue, because there were voices that we lacked and that we needed, and at the same time greta had written a debate article in Svenska Dagbladet which was very good. So then I contacted greta and then she along with some teachers and some high school, college and university students, attended an online meeting to find out how we can mobilize young people.**   
&gt;  
&gt;And then I made the suggestion that we could start a school strike before the election. And that was something that greta was inspired by.  
&gt;  
&gt;P4 radio: When you say we, Mr bo, who is behind it?. People wonder who is it?, Who are you representing?.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bo thoren: I am involved in an organization called fossil-free Dahlsland and have been involved in climate issues since 2013, greta has been involved for many years too but here we get a new tool that I represent.  
&gt;  
&gt;P4 radio: But Bo, we have statutory schooling in sweden... school strike?. Do you have some concerns about it?.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bo thoren: None!, not at all...

If the majority thinks separatism should be illegal that may be wrong and/or immoral, but it isn't undemocratic. Democracy fundamentally is mob rule with the caveat that the mob is supposed to be enlightened. Of course representative democracy tempers it quite a bit, but fundamentally politicians still need to do what the majority want even when that is bad thing.

Turkey then leans towards Russia and Middle East, Russians establish a few bases close to Greek and Bulgarian borders. Not only do they own Crimea now, they have a military presence on the Eastern shore of the Black Sea. How do you think that works out for the EU?

This is just the latest of Erdogan's tantrums, where he wants more money from the EU and is butthurt for the military spanking he got in Siria. Unfortunately, like any geopolitical powerplay, common folk suffer.

We should keep him in the NATO, under control and we need to keep dangling the EU membership carrot. We also need a unified and firm response on Greek and Bulgarian borders, making it clear that these kinds of manoeuvres will not work.

This is a test for EU unity and ideas (or ideals :-) If we can't muster a reasonable and humane response to this kind of provocation, we don't stand a chance against anything more serious.

There are two children's charities that pretty much have the most respect out of all. I really like the program called ""Botrstvo"" - ""Godparenting"". Basically you (or a company) sign up to support a child's school needs - books, pencils, bags, the tree daily meals schools provide (though these are usually already covered by social transfers) and fees and gear for hobbies (generally one hobby is encouraged and covered) and school competitions, school trips and a summer camp.  Basically the program tries to make sure a kid isn't excluded or fulfilling their potential because of being poor - and they safeguard to make sure the money goes directly to the specific spending bills with minimal overhead. Additionally they act as a barrier between potential predators and vulnerable kids.

This is actually a pretty old cultural tradition, where the wealthiest of a village (priest, inn-keeper, farmer with lots of land) would patronage poor kids, if they were exceptional.

3871,"&gt; High capital costs, low fuel costs

Again, we want to go to a power system where we don't burn fuel we will have to live with that regardless of which power sources we choose. Every single power source that doesn't burn fossil fuel has the exact same problem. Its economically uninteresting to load follow with hydro, solar, wind, tidal etc too. We will have to reform our market from an OPEX based system to a CAPEX based system.

&gt; reactor lifetime that does not really change with capacity utilised

Currently it does, the economic lifetime of a nuclear powerplant is mostly limited by the reactor vessel lifetime as replacing it is rather expensive. Its ageing is directly related to the power level due to neutron bombardment. Lifetime of a reactor vessel is calculated in EFPY (equivalent full power years) so a vessel that lasts 80 years at full power lasts 160 years at half power.

&gt;aggressive modulating of power output leads to extreme changes in pressure

Not on the reactor side of things, pressure remains constant troughout the power range. On the turbine side sure, but that's true for any powerplant that load follows. Pressure isn't a lifetime limiting factor for turbine components.

&gt; temperature

Again not on the primary side, only on the turbine side. Only on between the main steam throttle valves and moisture seperator reheater. So the high pressure turbine ages faster when load following. In a classic CCGT plant not only the high pressure turbine suffers from this but also the boiler, gas turbine, intermediate pressure and low pressure turbines. So from this perspective its more interesting to load follow with a nuclear plant rather than a CCGT unit.

&gt;coolant flow.

For a PWR the coolant flow remains constant troughout the power range. For a BWR coolant flow reduces. On the turbine side of things coolant flow reduces for both types of reactors. This is actually a good thing as erosion is currently the limiting factor for turbine components in NPPs. So load following would increase the lifetime of components.

&gt;Then there's the problem of neutron poisoning, which basically makes technically impossible the sort of extreme flexibility we can achieve with gas plants.

Xenon poisening isn't an issue for load following until the very end of the fuel cycle (the last 15%). It doesn't mean you cannot use the plant flexibly anymore it just means you cannot return to full power within the first 4hours after a downpower. CCGT plants have similar issues, if you drop power below 30-40% of output you have to shut down to avoid excessive NOx emissions and to avoid cooling down components like the HRSG too much causing cracks. Shutting down means they can cool down gently and you can only restart if they're cool enough again. CCGT plants face this issue always, while nuclear plants only have it in the last 1-2 months of their 12-24 month fuel cycle. And nuclear plants can avoid it by not going into stretchout operation and not depleting the boron in the coolant completely.

&gt;The bottom line is that fantasies which have nuclear power constantly adapting to changing renewable output are uneconomical

In the current market. In the current market any new form of power generation is downright uneconomical, load following or not. We'll have to adapt our market.

Gay marriage, like most progressive ideals, inverts this concept. Instead of rejecting vice and embracing responsibility to ones community, it embraces vice and passion.

Most of North and South America, Western and Northern Europe, Australia, South Africa and Taiwan. That's quite a few.

&gt; No, at its core, marriage is a religious ceremony where a man and woman officially form a union that is attested by a divine figure/entity. The legal privileges and rights came much later when humans became familiar with writing and when there was a need to regulate family and intimate relationships by law. 

Marriage predates the church by literal thousands of years, and was at its core a social and legal construct, to ensure things like filiation or inheritance. Marriage in Mesopotamia happened with a legal contract being drawn between the families of the groom and the bride, not with a religious ceremony eternally binding people before a divine figure. 

Have you actually researched and read history articles about this, or did you just assume so?

&gt; No because that would mean that the state would meddle into matters of faith. A secular state doesn't just mean that the church is separated from politics, it also means that the state recognizes the Church's sole power in affairs of religion.

4033,"So, your contention is that the much lower numbers of deaths in other european countries compared to Italy are due to a large number of deaths not being detected as corona cases in those countries rather than a larger number of infections in Italy? 

And your only evidence is one death in Spain that was not recognised as a corona case at a point when the number of confirmed cases in Spain was 2 (both tourists that very likely didn't get infected in Spain)?

The only death count you seem to consider reasonably accurate is the Italian one, everyone else must have missed dozens of deaths if you're to be believed and the one lucky exception to that absurd overextrapolation on your part is Italy for some reason. 

This doesn't just apply to european countries (where most of the outbreaks are probably not as far along as in Italy), you could also take South Korea for comparison.

The outbreak there clearly started before the one in Italy but their reported death count stands at only 35 from 5766 confirmed cases.

Italy is only reporting ~half the confirmed cases but ~3 times the number of deaths.

If both countries have managed to detect a similar proportion of the total number of infections, the Italian health system must be failing quite hard compared to the South Korean one.

If both health systems are performing comparibly, the detection rate must be much lower in Italy. 


Another point of comparison could be Germany (though the numbers are still too small to draw reliable conclusions from), where the outbreak started at the same time and unrelated to the Italian outbreak.

Germany still hasn't recorded a single Death (as of yesterday) with 262 confirmed cases. Either Germany has done very well detecting and isolating cases early compared to Italy or German doctors are performing miracles keeping severe cases alive. 

But of course, your explanation is that everyone *except* Italy is missing (or hiding) the vast majority of deaths, nevermind the utter lack of evidence...",Germoney,/r/europe/comments/fcy6oq/coronavirus_latest_europe_scrambles_to_curb/fjj6oni/,KaktusKontrafaktus,1583384882

Lies, you just cut spending to the bone, invested it in your people, sighed happily, and continued criticizing the Americans for being baby-killing monsters because they still had a military.  Threats don't go away, they're always here.  Weakness invites aggression.

&gt;But that changed when the second wave of Middle East wars started that A) seemed purely there to fund the US military industrial complex

Do you not understand that Europe's oil comes from there?  And the US secures it for you?  There is a real danger that a superstate will arise and throw out the Americans and invite in the Russians, and then where would you be?  A middle east that is smashed into weak fragments is the best for everyone.  They cannot unite and are easily cowed or bought off.  Continuing the flow of cheap oil is what the west was built on.  Remove it and you destroy yourselves.

4095,"After WWII, the US opened its markets wide to European competition.  It was a deliberate trade: the Americans basically bribed Europe to stay on the good guys' side in the Cold War.  (It's forgotten today, but free and fair elections postwar would likely have resulted in western Europe collapsing like dominos as socialist/communist governments were elected, see Italy, Greece and France.)  Europe could export its goods to America, pocket the cash, and erect protectionist barriers to ensure its industries grew.

All well and good.  The only losers were the American working class, but it's pretty clear by now nobody gives a fuck about them. 

But then something terrible happened.  America won the Cold War!  There was no further reason for this situation to continue.  But nobody adjusted the policies after 1989.  They just continued, with the developed First World nations of Europe continuing to take full advantage and laughing all the way to the bank.  

Then Americans noticed that they were getting ripped off and there was no reason to continue this state of affairs.  Europe was free-riding on American largesse and Trump was the only one who promised to do anything about it.  Obama just tut-tutted and got ready to approve TTIP and TPP, which would have utterly destroyed what remained of the American working class.

I said it before, but I am actually undecided on gay marriage. But, this argument always pops up in my mind, when I hear that it's seen as a human rights issue, like slavery, racism, etc. It's just not.

And actually it is really important to not label this as right, because (maybe you guessed this) it could be a slippery slope. You can say that it's lazy, but it's true.

Let me reverse your questions. What if I tell you that it's a human right to have multiple wives and husbands. People have weird relationships. Or what if I want to marry your wife, and she just don't want to divorce and we don't really want to ask you about it, you have no right to interfere in our marriage. If you think that would be weird, you are just taking away my human rights to marry whomever I want.
 Or what if someone really would like to get her mom, daughter or both of the same time on the next level? What if they are consenting adults? Like, who tells that person whom they are allowed to marry?

I am actually an atheist, so the religious textbooks doesn't help me out. But, if you followed the history of humanity marriage was kind of a thing for most of the time, generally between one man and one woman.

Well, for the discrimination, marriage is all about discrimination if you think about it. When you marry someone, you are discriminating the other ~6 billion people whom you are not marrying (given that there is no legal constraint to have them one-on-one). I definitely feel like a victim of Margot Robbie for not marrying me. I want my rights!

4152,"Let's take it from the start.

They say this:

&gt;So why are there so many deaths in South Korea and italy if they are handling it so well?

To which the u/djb1034 responds that the number of deaths is due to the high numbers of tests done in Italy

&gt;Because it‚Äôs a potentially deadly virus without a known treatment? It kills 1-2% under the best circumstances. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by your question. Due to the lack of testing it‚Äôs quite likely other countries have uncounted deaths. 
&gt;The reason I say Italy and Korea are doing well is that they were the first outside China to start testing every possible case.

The response from hamiltonfan is this:

&gt;I dont buy your premise that there are only more cases in italy because they test more.

And brings up the UK, which is not really the only country in Europe, to prove the point that Italy has an anomalous number of cases and, therefore, deaths in what I can imagine is an attempt to answer to his strating rhetorical question.

Djb's response is this:

&gt;it definitely appears worse than it is due to the lack of widespread testing elsewhere. There are very likely more cases and deaths in other countries that are uncounted, even if Italy might still have more. We will find out for sure in the coming weeks. 
&gt;My main point was that ‚ÄúItaly fucked up‚Äù isn‚Äôt accurate, because they‚Äôve handled this better than any other western country so far. The fact that they have the most confirmed cases and deaths in the west doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôve fucked up.

In their response, hamiltonfan mentions this:

&gt;Right, but you said the 'main' reason they have more cases is because they are testing more.
&gt;So their death count being much higher than anywhere else in europe would mean one of two things. 1, their health care system isn't very effective at saving people, or 2, there are dozens and dozens of deaths in other countries that are unaccounted for.
&gt;I think the reality is that there is just more cases in italy that anywhere else in Europe. I'm not saying they fucked up, but the high number of cases in italy isn't down to more testing.
&gt;Italy has 79 confirmed deaths. The next highest European country is France with 4.

I respond by saying that most of the big amounts of deaths are from weakened people in Italy, that in the rest of Europe the death stats from coronavirus are not reliable yet since the sampling pool is way smaller, that this is a fact virologists agree upon and that Italy has strict screenings that go beyond testing carriers, going as far as testing people who have a third degree of contact with the suspected cases (which means friends of friends). I state, wrongly, that once you get the virus, there is no way to be saved, while I should have said that there is no cure but intensive care can save people.

That was to prove that the health care system is not to blame for how many people died. Even when actively saving someone is accounted for, numbers look within a margin of error (considering France's numbers brought up by hamiltonfan), 1/2 recovered to dead in Italy (which has since become closer to 1/3) vs  1/3 in France. Due to France's small pool size, Italy looks fairly in line.

That was to disprove specifically this part of his reply:

&gt;So their death count being much higher than anywhere else in europe would mean one of two things. 1, their health care system isn't very effective at saving people, or 2, there are dozens and dozens of deaths in other countries that are unaccounted for.

If number one is disproven then number two is the other outcome (assuming his assumptions are correct).

He replies to my comment with this:

&gt;Most people who get it don't die so I'm not sure what you mean by you cant prevent people from dying once they get the virus.

Thinking that by what I wrote I meant I think that the disease is a death sentence. What I said is that deaths are inevitable and the death rates are, again, within the expected trend.

This leads to a back and forth culminating in this:

&gt;It was a rhetorical question to the previous poster.
&gt;The poster said that italy probably doesnt have more cases of corona virus than any other country, but they have just recorded more cases because they test more.
&gt;I made the point that because italy has recorded 75 more deaths than the next highest EU country that it's pretty clear that there are more cases in italy.
&gt;I.e if there were a similar number of cases in for example, France, there would be a similar number if deaths.

Their point, to their own saying, is that since there are more deaths in Italy then there are more people who got infected. My rebuttal was that it simply isn't true. There are more people who are *tested* and thus more people are *verified* to be infected.

When that point finally gets cleared up he asks me this

&gt;So are you suggesting that if someone is hospitalised in another with coronavirus like symptoms and then dies, they are not doing to test if they had the virus?

Which is the point djb and I were trying to make. Coronavirus deaths that are not suspected (deaths from before the outbreak, from people who didn't travel or come into contact with an infected patient) are easily discarded as complications from common flu or preexisting conditions, [so much that Spain did a post mortem test of a patient who died in February](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN20Q2TG). The result came in today confirming him as positive. If tests were done on dead patients even withouth suspicious backgrounds, the number of deaths would be higher than the norm. The fact that the number of deaths is in line with the death rates means that the testing is not done in a targeted manner, but rather that the live population is tested.

&gt;The UK for example has done 14,000 tests. Italy has done 23,000. The number of confirmed cases in the UK is 50, and the number in italy is 2500. 

In this other part, they state that Italy is anomalous because the UK had done 14000 tests and the resulting infected population is much lower. But the UK still is just one case out of many. Let's take France, for example. [They carried out 1170 tests as of March 3rd and they found out 212 positives](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-et-traumatismes/maladies-et-infections-respiratoires/infection-a-coronavirus/articles/covid-19-situation-epidemiologique-en-france). With a pool so low it goes without saying that the deaths are much lower, but the other big info we get from this is that France has a 18% test/positive ratio, as opposed to Italy's 10%. This number is probably higher due to the small sampling size and could get lower if the latter gets larger, but as of now it tells us two things: 1) the second nation by number of infected in Europe tests way less than Italy 2) the trend of infection they have looks on par with Italy.

This means that this

&gt;I made the point that because italy has recorded 75 more deaths than the next highest EU country that it's pretty clear that there are more cases in italy.
&gt;I.e if there were a similar number of cases in for example, France, there would be a similar number if deaths.

Is not necessarily true due to the proven lack of testing. [Italy is testing more than all of Europe](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/covid-19-testing/) and that's why there are so many reported deaths.

The aid was shipped on board the vessel SS Kurtulu≈ü with big symbols of the Red Crescent painted on both sides. (See SS Kurtulu≈ü for more information.)

https://www.voanews.com/europe/germany-vows-keep-troops-lithuania-invest-more-barracks

Germany, France, and Italy are literally spending  as much as the next 24 EU countries combined.
Hence we are the ones pushing for an EU military the most as 24 tiny armies buying everything multiple times does not help us with actual larger threats.
Together with France we also push for domestic weapons production in Europe instead if buying American ones.

And Germany already has some unified military units with France, Netherlands, and Denmark.
An independent EU military with domestic weapon production in Europe is literally Germans current foreign policy and military goal.

And on Turkey, Germany is one of the most negative towards Turkey from all of the EU members, specifically due to our large local Turkish population of over 1 million, which has caused political issues with Erdogan in the past.

Independent EU military? Yeah right. Germany wants domestic EU production to strengthen its own export numbers! Protectionism is great when you have a comparative advantage, it's called a monopoly. The French under Macron are the ones pushing for further unification and a common foreign policy by sharing their nuclear deterrent, not the Germans unless you have any source or argument for your claim. Germany routinely defies European agenda on Libya (excluding Greece whose territorial waters are threatened to appease Erdogan during the peace talks) and Russia (Nordstream 2).

The economic ties trump most of the unfavorable sentiment. I think it's safe to assume that most Germans care more about business than ever appearing preconceived or racist, god forbid.

Anywho, fishes. While the EU 'refusing to buy' is a silly notion, as AFAIK the commission buys its fish retail just like everyone else, and embargoing importers would be entirely too draconian a thing for the EU to even consider here, there will be drawbacks. WTO terms being the very absolute least of those. (6.9% tariffs. Big whoop.)

There'll be additional costs. Just the manhours going into additional administration involved in shipping to the EU. I've no idea how complicated or time-consuming the paperwork in shipping fish abroad is, but then, most of the UK's fishermen selling their fish in Europe haven't got a clue either, cause thus far abroad hasn't been quite as abroad as they think they want it to be. So that adds to the tariffs. And then there's the waiting. Forms need to be checked on the receiving end. The goods themselves as well, unless the UK decides to uphold EU standards which, long odds. So these fishermen end up competing on the same market they used to before, selling the same fish, just less fresh and at a higher price, fingers crossed there'll be a shortage in the EU.

And then there's the issue of whose fishing waters they are anyway.

&gt;There are different rules for public and private spaces and therefore your analogy doesn't work.

It's an analogy, but yes, it works. Analogies serve as comparisons between two things, they are not literal otherwise I would have just repeated the situation as it stands.

&gt;Why not right there? I don't see why it's so difficult to just say yes. Because you think allowing doctors there automatically means being ok with people smuggling?

It's not difficult to say yes, I just don't particularly want that. The doctors are part of the same groups that have been carrying out the people smuggling, so it's quite understandable why people would be angry with them.

&gt;I cannot understand that people would attack doctors. You say it's making the island too hospitable. I say they are reducing human suffering.

Reducing the suffering of the illegal immigrants maybe, but in the long term increasing the suffering of those who live there by making the island hospitable and encouraging / aiding more illegal immigration.

&gt;No, what you should do if they cannot leave is you give them jobs and training so that they can contribute.

People whose first act on your soil is breaking the law are not people you should be keeping, training, and giving jobs to.

&gt;And why should the island not be hospitable?

For those who have illegally entered it? Because it should not be hospitable for those who are illegally entering. It should be inhospitable for the short time prior to their deportation, and it should be unattractive to all those considering illegally entering it.

The illegal immigration must be stopped. The people of Europe are fed up with it, you can hear this everywhere you go across Europe.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/fdcuvi/we_left_fearing_for_our_lives_doctors_set_upon_by/fjhylyb/,specofdust,1583357459

""Union l√©gitime de deux personnes dans les conditions pr√©vues par la loi.""  
Yup nothing about religion.  
  
&gt; Absolutely not. It enormously depends of he context. The civil mariage is a quick 15 minutes ceremony. People dont talk about it. The real deal is the religious one.  
  
Are you saying gay people who get married don't talk about it in France? I find that hard to believe (because it's wrong).  
  
&gt; You are wrong and ignorant of religious people in france then.  
  
Now admittedly I don't know any French religious person, but if a couple told me they're married when they only had a religious cereomy (and are thus not actually married), I'd laugh at them.  
  
&gt; No. Im describing Mariage. A religious mariage is a pleonasm.  
  
The dictionary definition and legal definition of marriage is devoid of religion. You have to mention ""religious"" marriage otherwise the default is the civil one.

+ in Germany and Austria the state collects the church taxes of the ones who are members directly from the income, together with other taxes

4468,"&gt;First thing: Poland is not Saudi Arabia and LGBT situation in Poland is not equivalent to any ""not ruling/male"" situation in Saudi Arabia. 

No, it's not, but it was an example of the principle you support. That you oppose equal rights because you don't see them feasible in forseeable future.

&gt;Second: If there would be smaller victory that could be gained much easier in SA, instead of large/total victory that comes no one knows when... Of course i would be for fighting small battle, to win the war, than wasting time fighting loosing grand battle.

Supporting that smaller victory does not require you to oppose the larger goal.

&gt;Of course i would be for fighting small battle, to win the war, than wasting time fighting loosing grand battle.

You don't have to waste anything to have the opinion ""I think we should have same sex marriage"", instead you argue against having same sex marriage at some point. Because that's what you started to question above, same sex marriage in general, not same sex marriage as the immediate next goal.

&gt;But it is ideology war. You show 0 pragmatism in your arguments.

How is having an opinion ""ideology war""? I'm not campaiging anything in Poland. I just have the opinion that people should have equal rights to marriage. It's not a war. It's an opinion, and you argue against that opinion claiming having opinion alone is ""0 pragmatism ideology war"" when I have nowhere said what should be the practical roadmap to reaching same sex marriage.

&gt;Then think for yourself what is the proper way of fighting the battle. Attacking where opponent's resistance is strong with small forces, or attack where it's weak with larger one?

Stating an opinion is not ""a battle"". It's stating an opinion.

&gt;You may support whatever you want, just think what you say in public discussion and how will that affect progress of implementing changes. Do you want to see results and progress or just stroke yourself how mightily and futile you are fighting on the internet?

This is r/europe, not Poland. I'm not going to censor myself on reddit because Polish people need a safe space from criticism.

And if you decide to oppose same sex marriage, the responsibility lies on you, not on me. It's your choice, not mine.

&gt;&gt;Like Poland is on a crusade against LGBT rights with ""LGBT free zones"" and safe spaces.

4496,"&gt;55% of people born after the dissolution of the USSR still support treating us as second class citizens.

What?

&gt;However I would have expected, that country that brands itself technologically advanced country (which is in a lot of ways is true) and is among one of the most Atheist counties in the world, would have done better than ultra catholic Poland with LGBT-free zones and Orthodox Romania, which is one of the poorest countries in the EU.

Religiosity and LGBT-acceptance aren't universally related. And the people, who are responsible for Estonia's technological advancement, definitely fall with the more LGBT-accepting group...

&gt;I expected to se Estonia in the same bracket as Czechia.

Again, one was directly occupied by the Soviet Union and has a major immigrant Russian population with vastly different social norms, the other one doesn't.

&gt;Now I'm not saying that to drag any of those countries down. All of them have made a lot of progress in the past 30 years. I just wish they were more accepting.

It would be first a bit naive and second a bit pointlessly condescending to expect that from nations that have made immense progress within three decades and will continue to do so.

&gt;treating 25% of your country's population as a problem that is dragging your statistics down doesn't help to improve those statistics.

No, it doesn't. But hiding your head in the sand and not addressing those differences won't solve anything either. And Estonians being ""held responsible"" for the worse off statistics of our Russian minority sure as hell won't get anyone to accept that minority faster.

&gt;I hope your integration programs are working. I'd love to see good data sources which could indicate how successful Integration has been.

Perhaps [one statistic about language knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Estonia#/media/File:Estonia._Knowledge_of_languages.png) is good for demonstrating how integration has worked for different generations. Notice the data for knowledge of Estonian - it has risen a lot for younger generations if compared to the older ones.

&gt;that would give me hope that Russia could, some day in the future turn around and stop being so god damn regressive.

It could perhaps lose some of its aggressiveness, but Russia is inherently imperialistic and antagonized by the West - it's just rooted so deeply into its history and culture.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/fdawug/samesex_marriage_approval_in_europe_2017/fjh8l07/,k6lvatu,1583343323

There are two issues

1, the meager national quota for what is caught in our EEZ  

2, the inability to block foreign buyers purchasing the UK quota

4830,"&gt; Bruh its 2020, racism is so petty and old fashioned at this point. 

Not sure what you're talking about, i never mentioned racism anywhere.

&gt; Yes, the government lied to them if not blatantly but still, but you refuse to understand the fact that they are not our problem either. I dont remember a single EU country welcoming them, all they did was ‚Äúpay‚Äù Turkey to hold them in our borders. 

Well you *are* their neighboring country. You would be obliged to take them in, of course assuming you're following UN standards etc, and that kind of makes them your problem but i fully understand Turkey's problem. The thing is, it's more Turkey's problem than it is the rest of Europe's. We don't border Syria. Obviously the EU's plan of paying Turkey to keep them wasn't efficient but what else would it do? Why would it take refugees that it didn't want when it doesn't even border them? The EU isn't obliged to take in every poor soul of every warzone on the planet. It can't support that. A compromise where it lets Turkey handle the problem and giving it money for it was a simple ""solution"" back then but not so much for Turkey. 

&gt; And yet 3/5 of that payment is yet to come. dont throw morals back at my face, you dont want these people, maybe you dont even see them ad people to begin with considering your racist remark. 

I see reports that the money has been allocated but it wasn't accessible by Turkey. Not sure exactly how that works. However i seriously doubt that the 3 billions are your real problem here. Erdogan would have done the same even if the money had been received in full. I think you know this as well. 

How do i not see them as people, wtf are you talking about? I didn't make any recist remark. Of course i see them as people and i think it's tragic that they have to go through that but that doesn't mean that we'll bankrupt our countries (even more in Greece's case) because there's a lot of sadness in the world. There are many homeless people in Turkey, i bet. How many are you hosting in your house? If the answer is none, why not? Do you not see them as people? The answer is that you feel bad for them but you know that you can't afford to take them all in. It wouldn't solve the problem, it would bankrupt you and then both you and them would be on the street. Not wanting to take 3 million people in just because Turkey found a way to blackmail the EU doesn't make us racist or inhumane. Don't think that you'll use the humanity card in order to destabilize other countries like that.

&gt; Bro, US invaded syria, countries including half the balkans and even Germany sold the free army weapons, Russia supported the government with heavy weapons (classic cold war stuff) and yet you have the audacity to blame Turkey? 

Oh don't get me wrong, i blame the USA and Russia as well. I know full well that they have messed the middle east up, but Turkey is not doing anything different. Of course you claim that you're there protecting yourselves and setting up a zone for th refugees and all that jazz, but guess what.. the USA also had its own reasons for being there. At least in their minds they were justified too. Everyone has a reason. Turkey had a reason for Cyprus too and look at what happened. 45 years later it's still occupying half the island based on an excuse. Your actions in Syria also affect what's going on.

&gt; Turkey was fighting with PKK, which was terrorizing our borders so I see that justified. 

Again, that's what the USA would claim as well. How are you any different?

&gt; Im from a half-asian Muslim country, we‚Äôre all goatfuckers in the end arent we my racist friend? 

You keep throwing that word around but you're the one that has said the only racist thing in here. I'm still not sure what you found racist about my previous comment. 

&gt; But still my point remains, the war is all too complicated for us to comprehend, especially with all the misinformation going around. I personally dont know if not only yours but my knowledge is incorrect nor unbiased. MY POINT is you dont get to bitch about us sending the immigrants over to EU after not doing a single damn thing about them for the past 3 years. 

I agree with the first part. We both share our points of view based on the knowledge that we have. Regarding the second part, like i said before i seriously doubt that Turkey's real issue here is the 3 missing billions (if they're indeed missing cause i see conflicting views about that). The way i see it Erdogan found the chance to hold the EU by the balls with that deal and he's been using these people are a bargaining chip for years. Now he opened the gates asking for support from the EU in what he's doing in Syria. MY point was how you're misguiding these people sending them to be stuck in between the borders by telling them that they can go to Germany or w/e when you know full well that the borders are closed, and you talk about human rights and humanity.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/fd2w5e/joint_press_conference_by_european_commission/fjgcgt8/,Divide-By-Zero88,1583321870

Also quality was low, walls often crooked, not mentioning media weren't provided for long time.

So - we should punish Turkey, not burn down the systems that are there as a safety net for you and me.

4985,"&gt; Natural Gas + Renewables -&gt; Nuclear + Renewables 

That doesn't work. You cannot economically replace Natural Gas with nuclear power. And the word economically is the very important part.

The cost of the electricity produced in nuclear power plants comes 90% from the plant itself. In this it never makes an sense to throttle the power output down, as the fuel is just that cheap. If you do throttle your output down, you also reduce the lifetime energy output, thus each unit of energy you do produce must rise in price accordingly.

In this, nuclear power takes the same spot as renewables. And here renewables (or rather on-shore wind) already beat nuclear in price per unit of energy.

To replace natural gas we need another solution. And this solution might be actually: natural gas. That is if we pre-produce natural gas from surplus energy that we will inevitably have in summer if our ""carbon neutral"" goal ever comes close to being achieved. 

Though it's more likely that we will stop at the mid step of producing natural gas, which is hydrogen, as we then lose less energy in the process (energy-&gt;hydrogen-&gt;energy is currently at best 50% efficient)",Germany,/r/europe/comments/fd3ddf/uks_co2_emissions_fell_by_29_in_2019_to_levels/fjg1izy/,Alcobob,1583307481

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;When the Europeans tried to starve her realm into submission for the crime of being a protestant state

England was not threatened for being a Protestant state, but as a direct result of Elizabeth meddling in the internal affairs of various European powers, [most notably Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War). Religious obedience was a vastly secondary matter in the overall context of power politics she decided to get involved in.

As a matter of fact, Spain was initially supportive of Elizabeth against Mary (who was a Catholic for her part, but backed by France), and only became outright hostile toward England, unsurprisingly, after Elizabeth involved her realm in Spanish affairs by supporting the Dutch revolt against the Spanish crown. So, pretty much standard geopolitics.

Beside openly supporting their enemy, decades of renewed English privateering against Spanish interests in the Atlantic and the Caribs most certainly didn't help averting further deterioration of their relationship over time.

&amp;nbsp;

Most importantly, England certainly wasn't threatened with ""starvation"". This claim, in particular, is devoid of any logic or historicity, and I'm not sure why you made it.

It strictly cannot be *litteral* starvation. England was self-reliant for its food (as were pretty much all European countries back then), and only ceased to be thus in the late 18th century, at the outset of its industrial revolution.

It strictly cannot be *economic* starvation either (*i.e.* akin to the [Continental System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System)\). If England was freely able to maritimely trade with foreign territories as distant as the Ottoman Empire and the Barbary Coast (which required crossing the Habsburg key area of influence around the Iberian and Italian peninsulae), then nothing prevented it from doing the same with virtually any other European country of its choosing, considering the only European power England was consistently in conflict with under Elizabeth was the Iberian Union.

Either way, that statement is overall anachronistic, because protracted naval blockades were pretty much impossible in the 16th century, European navies were simply not doctrinally and technologically ready for it yet.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, the actual reason England traded with the Ottomans (and mostly for non-essential wares, as you pointed out yourself: silk, spice or sugar) was because Spain and Portugal were controlling the sea routes to Asia around Africa and through the Americas -- and the reason they were in the first place was the direct consequence of the Ottomans barring their way to Asia.

France, a major Catholic power, was trading with the Ottomans aswell, and for the exact same reasons. 

Their relationship went even much further: whereas England merely remained a trading partner, France became an actual [ally of the Ottomans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Ottoman_alliance), as early as 1536, and for nearly three centuries.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The alliance lasted 300 years, right up to WW1, when bizarely the Ottomans took the opposite side to us.

There's nothing ""bizarre"" about it, it's simply power politics, again: the interests of the Ottomans gradually came to become more aligned with those of the Central Powers than with those of the Triple Entente.

The increasing involvement of the UK (and other European powers) in Ottoman affairs, notably in the Balkans and in Greece, certainly didn't help nurturing a good relationship either.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The Crimean War in the 19th century was about the UK coming to the aid of the Ottomans when the Russians attacked Crimea and tried to seize it.

The Crimean War was more about barring Russia from gaining more control over the Black Sea, than about helping the Ottomans. France, the UK and Austria joined the Ottomans for their own opportunistic motives.

As a matter of fact, when war broke out again between Russia and the Ottoman Empire [two decades later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1877%E2%80%931878\)), neither the UK or France helped the Ottomans. By then, the German Empire had become the new threat in Europe, and Russia was a new objective ally to contain it. Which unsurprisingly pushed the Ottomans further away from the UK and France, and eventually toward Germany.

Incidentally, on the onset of the Crimean War, Crimea was already Russian, and had been for almost a century. It was hardly a territory Russia would want to ""seize"": it was already theirs.",France,/r/europe/comments/fczoi2/uk_offers_full_support_to_turkey_over_idlib/fjfws57/,Orravan_O,1583302632

5198,"&gt; I have always thought it strange how communist East German forces retained more of a Wehrmacht look than the West given the titanic struggle the Wehrmacht waged against the Soviet Union.

I've been doing a bit of googling about it, and the recurring explanation I see being given is that the DDR was actively trying to present itself as the legitimate continuation of Germany, and trying to appeal to the Prussian refugees and the Nationalist veterans (which still formed a big chunk of the population in the 1950s). Deriding the Bundeswehr as being fashioned like ""US Mercenaries"" or ""vassals"" was something they could use against them in propaganda, and in the fight for the DDR to be recognized as the ""real and legitimate Germany"". Again, these are things I am being told by elderly east Germans and a pattern I see recurring when this topic is discussed, but there aren't any concrete documents that seem to prove anything.


&gt;As far as the Bundeswehr is concerned, it was created to be a speed bump to slow the Soviet Army in Europe long enough to allow the United States to bring it's full weight to bare. Sadly, many still feel it should be treated as a lowly auxiliary force and not one capable of independently defending Germany.

How long was West Germany expected to last in the event of WW3? I often hear of ""[the Red Army] reaching the Rhine in 7 days"", but I don't know if that's based on professional estimates or just Tom Clancy books

&gt;All that being said, there are still many patriotic, determined men and women that proudly wear the uniform of the German army. I am still currently active duty myself. I don't think saying which unit I am in would be wise here, but I am fortunate to serve with mature individuals that share my passion for defending Germany.

That's nice to hear; I have full trust in the peaceful and humanitarian nature of modern Germany, and I think many people of my generation feel the same way.

You are giving yourself *way* too much credit. I have rarely seen someone using such a faulty metric to make such a broad conclusion.

&gt;Unlike Estonia which AGAIN fails to have a single noble of literature. Actually it fails at having a nobel prize at all. Another proof that Estonia fails to have any relevance so far.

In your world only issues relating to the Nobel Prize are related to relevance? :D

This is one of the weirdest concepts I have encountered.

&gt;Netherland has other things to back their placr in the history book. Things that Estonia doesnt have either.

By your standards, only imperialist gains ""count"" as historical achievements... You know, modern people are more ashamed of colonialism, but I guess in Russia they still teach you to be proud of it - but it's not the only aspect, where Russia is mentally a century behind others.

&gt;Concerning your intangible list, i wouldnt call a special way to smoke salmon, something worth mentioning, but i guess when you have nothing, even a little modest thing will do

The elite was originally Germanic (Scandinavian) but this elite was always a minority and they mostly settled in the river valleys surrounded by a multitude of Slavic (and a minority of Baltic and Uralic) peoples. In a way, the story of the Rus bears some parallells to the story of the Bulgars who settled in the Balkans. They were also originally non-Slavic, but they were Slavicized rapidly in order to better rule their subjects. 

There were other peoples living in what is today European Russia and Ukraine as well. Various Turkic steppe nomads like the Khazars you mentioned, the Cumans, the Pechenegs, the Volga Bulgars and some Iranic Alans roamed the steppes and fought or traded frequently with the settled Slavs and Rus. However the latter did not mingle much with the Slavs, unlike the Vikings in part due to their nomadic tradition.

5258,"Whereas I agree that Turkey is not a warzone and the refugees could very well settle down there, I'd like to add a few things:

1) Turkey is not capable nor responsible for taking in all the refugees. The refugees are a damage to the economy. The reason why EU should take the refugees in, is because of the Human Rights that every human should be allowed to live free from a warzone. Turkey has allegedly spent 40 billion ‚Ç¨ taking in the refugees upon the agreement with the EU, but the EU has only helped with 6 billion (?) ‚Ç¨ and still allegedly they didn't give the whole sum yet.

2) Europe is bigger and better off. We could take in the war-zone refugees and spread them throughout Europe, giving each country a relative amount of refugees to take care of. We can't throw 1 million refugees into Germany, but we can throw 100000 in Germany, 80000 in France, 70000 in Spain, 15000 in Austria, 15000 in Romania, 10000 in Hungary and so on (rough estimate) so that each country deals with a smaller problem and is not overrun by the refugees. The estimate should be either based on the country's population or the country's wealth.

3) Yes, I understand that there are a lot of economic refugees from North Africa and non-war-zones, but I don't have numbers for the real ratio (is it war-nonwar refugees 50-50? 10-90?). That is not relevant. I believe that we should have a sort of ""check-in"" process at the border, where you make sure that the refugees come from the war zones (can they speak Syrian? Iranian? whatever else country's language there is currently a war in?) then you let them in.

4) The way we could deal with them is to build refugee camps where they are ""isolated"" and are taught a local languages, and their kids can go to school. Yes, this would be tough on the EU's economy, but if we want to act humanely, we can't just turn a blind eye to the whole world.

I've been talking a lot with my friends about this issue, and I feel like these are the most important points from our conversations, of which the anti-refugee people are not really aware. This is the solution which would appease the left, if the EU could take the required steps towards. I feel like it is a practical enough and doable solution, if the population of EU would be aware of the issues in a transparent way.

I myself have no sympathy for war refugees. I would call myself an emotionless machine. But there is a huge misunderstanding between the pro-refugee stance and the anti-refugee stance. I thought I could write this message to you so you would be open to a new idea. Hopefully this makes sense.

5283,"I'm not surprised to hear that. Russia and USSR won against Napoleon and the Third Reich, after initial setbacks and some effective scorched earth tactics. In Napoleon's case the Cossacs helped a lot too, and they used field tactics similar to the Mongols and other steppe peoples (Turks, Magyars etc.). Von Clausewitz described these campaigns in considerable detail, although he was very biased against the Cossacs due to his upbringing and the cultural shock after witnessing steppe-style warfare first hand. 

On the other hand, the Rus principalities were no match for the Mongol hordes, and it must be mentioned that the Mongols had overall numerical inferiority and were operating thousands of miles away from their homeland. They also waited for winter to come before launchig the full scale invasion, likely for practical reasons. Scorched earth and extreme cold did not stop them, the two Mstislavs did not stop them, the Poles and Hungarians also did not stop them. They devastated every Russian town (except for Novgorod), fully conquered all of Russia and supported the Principality of Moscow against its regional rivals.

5306,"I still think you are being far too critical in a situation that could have been handled better, but mostly in hindsight.

First off, people are forgetting already that essentially, we were following WHO guidelines. The WHO criticized border closures with China and stressed the need to prevent panic and minimise the economic impact of overreacting, even as China was mobilising itself and starting to crack down on the epidemic. And though they were right in my opinion, at every stage their comments have always favoured China's needs and stance. It is part of why I find these latest comments praising its response dubious - *nothing* coming out of the WHO has been anything but glowing praise for China's response, even when they were handling it extremely poorly in the beginning. I believe that they've got their shit together now, but the amount of superlatives reeks of propaganda.

And in the end, what preparations would you have wanted to happen in a few weeks, exactly? I can think of two main things we could do better - stockpiling PPE, like facemasks, and better tracking and testing, like of the contacts of infections, and random  people in the vicinity. Complacency led to that not being done as well as it should have.

But we can't build more ICUs or hospitals, we can't quarantine literally everyone coming from at-risk countries, and we can't close borders with every infected country. As long as undiagnosable people can cross borders and infect others, the risk of an outbreak exists everywhere. This virus is, and always was, going to spread in the community.

China will have to deal with this as well, in a few weeks or months. Stopping the flow of people from one known highly infected area is one thing, cutting yourself off from an infected world is another. They will either close their borders entirely for years, or accept travel from the rest of the world, with cases in nearly every country. And so they will likely make a trade-off, putting people at risk to save their economy, just like the rest of us.

And no - no one is lying to you about masks. *Doctors* are saying they aren't much good, because in the hands of laypeople, they generally aren't. PPE needs to be used properly, or it is completely useless. And surgical masks are pretty useless in general, they can only stop direct droplets and stop you from touching your face - which a random piece of cloth from your house can do as well.

I get the sense that you are panicking, and seeking to blame someone for it. But it is far too early for such things. This whole thing is just starting, and could last for years.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/fcy6oq/coronavirus_latest_europe_scrambles_to_curb/fjf9i6d/,unsilviu,1583287147

PS: For the authorities to advise against face masks at a time scientific reports like the following is out there is criminal negligence:

&gt; If the neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 does take a part in the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, **the precaution with masks will absolutely be the most effective measure to protect against the possible entry of the virus into the CNS**. It may also be expected that the symptoms of the patients infected via facal-oral or conjunctival route will be lighter than those infected intranasally. The possible neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 may also partially explain why some patients developed respiratory failure, while others not. It is very possible that most of the persons in Wuhan, who were the first exposed to this previously unknown virus, did not have any protective measure, so that the critical patients is much more in Wuhan than in other cities in China.

5404,"&gt;Balli Kombetar, your Nazis

Balli Kombetar? Nazis? Only in Serbia. 

**Balli Kombetar literally means National Front and started as a resistance movement against the Italian fascists.**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balli\_Komb%C3%ABtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balli_Komb%C3%ABtar) 

&gt;With Italy on the brink of defeat in 1943, the Albanian National Liberation Movement (LNC) and the Balli Komb√´tar organized a meeting in the village of Mukje. The Balli Komb√´tar entered into a fragile alliance with the communist-led LNC, and acted as a resistance group against the Italians

When the Communists decided to side with the Yugoslavs in regards to Kosovo, they decided to fight the Communists as well. 

At a time when the Yugoslavs were doing things like this:

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar\_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_massacre) 

&gt;By 1942, the city of Bar became a home of many Serbians and other refugees who were forced to flee from Kosovo and to escape the violence done by Albanian units. Many of these joined the Partisan forces and participated in their activities at Bar.\[1\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The victims were Albanian recruits from Kosovo, who had been pressed by the Yugoslav Partisans into service. These men were then assembled in Prizren and marched on foot in three columns to Bar where they were supposed to receive short training and then sent off to the front.\[1\] The march took the rugged mountain ranges of Kosovo and Montenegro to reach its destination. Upon arrival locals reported that these men, who had marched a considerable distance, were ""exhausted"" and ""distressed"". The column of men which stretched a few kilometres were then gathered on the Barkso Polje. At one point, in Polje, one of the Albanians from the column attacked and killed one of the Yugoslav officers, Bo≈æa Dabanoviƒáa.\[1\] Very soon after that somebody from the column threw a smuggled bomb at the commander of the brigade.\[1\] This created a panic among the Partisans. The guards watching over the recruits then fired into the crowd killing many and prompting the survivors to flee into the surrounding mountains.\[1\] In another case, several hundred Albanians were herded into a tunnel, near Bar, which was subsequently sealed off so that all of those trapped within the tunnel were asphyxiated.\[2\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Yugoslav sources put the number of victims at 400\[1\] while Albanian sources put the figure at 2,000 killed in Bar alone.\[3\] According to Croatian historian Ljubica ≈†tefan, the Partisans killed 1,600 Albanians in Bar on 1 April after an incident at a fountain.\[4\] There are also accounts claiming that the victims included young boys.\[5\] Other sources cited that the killing started en route for no apparent reason and this was supported by the testimony of Zoi Themeli in his 1949 trial.\[6\] Themeli was a collaborator who worked as an important official of the Sigurimi, the Albanian secret police.\[7\] After the massacre, the site was immediately covered in concrete by the Yugoslav communist regime and built an airport on top of the mass grave.\[5\]

Then the Yugoslav-backed Enver Hoxha regime (whose propaganda you're regurgitating today) decided to paint them as Nazis. 

Here is your President Vucic praising **an actual Nazi**.

[https://www.rferl.org/a/vucic-s-great-milosevic-evokes-ghost-of-greater-serbia-/29486327.html](https://www.rferl.org/a/vucic-s-great-milosevic-evokes-ghost-of-greater-serbia-/29486327.html) 

&gt;Vucic had been expected in Mitrovica for weeks. The town was festooned with his photograph and Serbian flags in eager anticipation of his visit. September 9 was hotly anticipated as the day when Vucic would finally announce his plan to resolve major outstanding issues with Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians and to turn the corner in relations with the former Serbian province, which declared independence in 2008.  
&gt;  
&gt;It didn't happen. Instead, Vucic appeared to take almost everyone by surprise with one brief passage of his remarks, in particular: ""**Milosevic was a great Serbian leader who undoubtedly had the best intentions, but the outcome \[of his actions\] was very poor. Not because he wanted it that way, but because our wishes were unrealistic, while we neglected and underestimated the interests and aspirations of other nations. Because of that, we paid a greater price \[than others in the region\]. We haven't expanded**.""  
&gt;  
&gt;His praise in defense of Milosevic set off alarm bells across the region, as some interpreted it as a nod to the notion of ""Greater Serbia."" Like many nationalists in Serbia, some observers complained, **Vucic blames Milosevic for having lost the wars in the 1990s as opposed to having played a role in starting them.**",Albania,/r/europe/comments/fd1991/sierra_leone_revokes_recognition_of_kosovo/fjevtp0/,zsandxs,1583279155

The Mongols humiliated pretty much everyone they encountered (except for Japan) so my point is not to make fun of the Rus principalities for being weak.

I don't think even in a free media situation, Turkey will ever get truly ""close to unbiased"" news, we're just too much of an emotional/sentimental culture for that to happen.

Well you can always hope.

No matter how you dress up the chemical reaction and what type of solution you cover it with. Its like car engines, you can make them as environmentally friendly as possible they still burn fuel.

Now I am pro renewables totally but its clear that by 2050 we are going to fall short of all our climate targets if we put our money on renewables. Why is germany for instance building gas pipelines from Russia, endangering the Baltic Fauna and Flaura. Firstly gas is just a lesser evil than cole but its still an evil. And then the infrastructure requirements, the mining of the gas leads to a catastropic natural (both in Russia and the Baltic Sea) footprint. It also does not create energy security.

Desertec is a great solution in theory but I doubt that the Europeans that thought them up really took the local populace in consideration. We Europeans have this knack to outsource our challenges. Solar from Africa , Gas from Russia. As long as we dont see how it is produced or the local impact it has we live in our idyllic naivety.

Now most of the anti nuclear rethoric is based on 60s and 70s anti nuclear sentiment which is understandable. In Western Europe Nuclear research has come to a standstill because of emotional reasoning. If you compare France (nuclear driven society) vs Germany (chemical reaction driven society) the pollution footprint is staggeringly in France's favour as the lesser polluter.

&gt; How can you contribute to innovation if you're living in poverty? Through education. Not social welfare. 

Are you even reading what I am writing? Fucking hell. You CAN'T study, if you have to work several jobs and don't have time. You can't study, if you are stuck with immense debt. You can't study, if you are homeless. How are you going to study, if you can't buy books? You can't study if you are bankrupt or just dead from lack of healthcare. This is all social welfare.

If Kela doesn't give me enough money to buy food and have a home, then how the fuck am I going to study without savings? I'd be homeless and scraping by for food when unable to find a job.

It is hilarious that you are unable to see, that social welfare programs are immensely important in people getting that higher education, which in turn is required for increased innovation. 

Why do you think we have one of the best education in the world in Finland?  Because the government supports students with social welfare. Because you are not required to take huge amounts of debt to study. You aren't required to split your attention between work and studying.

5644,"The problem with communism is that it goes against a very inconvenient fact about nature, not just human but as a whole. Things differ, for example some wolves are better than others at hunting. Some stars are heavier than others. One way this fact gets translated to human society is the fact that some people are better than other people at doing certain things, some are luckier than others, you cannot change that fact. Now because we give value to things that people produce, people that produce more of them are better off than others. Some people might not be good at producing anything but they might be good at collecting wealth so they still get prestige(because wealth brings power, or more accurately shows power). To implement communism it is necessary to remove the fact that we value things. Even a post scarcity society would not be able to implement it i believe, as we can see in the west where most people are experiencing a post scarcity society but issues of inequality still exist. It is human nature to hoard resources and power to make yourself stand out, unless we genetically get rid of this tendency communism will not be able to work, as some people will always rise to the top.",Albania,/r/europe/comments/fctpot/with_the_end_of_the_ottoman_dominion_on_this_date/fje450a/,Jc_aquila,1583264876

&gt;Then we can actually proceed in treating them like we should. As an actual, serious threat towards the EU and its member states. It's a matter of safety and security. 

Do you think that right now we should be calling a country that has millions of refugees, an enemy? Erdogan will keep pushing refugees no matter what we call them.  


&gt; Oh, like he does now you mean? Also, newsflash: it's not erdogan that is the problem, turkey has always been hostile towards all its neighbors for many, many decades now (if not centuries), and it's only getting worse with every year. Besides, there is a limit to how much you can claim that you can't make someone ""mad"" because they will use their voter base against you. We are not their fucking punching bag that every time they wanna take our their issues on someone we should suffer for it. If their voters are stupid enough to be okay with this (or worse, if they truly support it in full knowledge) then that's even more reason to stop appeasing them. 

Again, how will calling them an enemy fix any of this, if anything they'll become even more aggressive. It won't fix anything.

&gt;We have tried the diplomatic way for decades at it's clearly not working. There is a limit to that as well. 

what do you propose then, a war?

&gt;Nothing emotional about it and you can lose the quotation marks here. This is a hostile state and they've proven it again and again. I can see you are deeply entrenched in the mindset of ""turkey is our vital ally and we can't live without them"" but the longer you pretend that there is nothing serious here, the worse consequences will come out of it and you need to realise this. 

So they can either be an ally or an enemy, nothing else? And the reality right now is that Turkey holds lots of migrants and they can keep sending them to Europe, like it or not it's still true. Like what do you think we should do?

I would conclude that 5 years is very reasonable, and that most people with any useful background or ability to learn should be able to find a job by then.

    Turkey is the EU's 5th largest trading partner, both in exports and imports. The EU is by far Turkey's number one import and export partner, as well as source of foreign direct investment (FDI).
    After several years of rapid growth in the EU-Turkey bilateral trade in goods, in 2018 trade showed a mixed picture, in particular due to the Turkish lira depreciation and broader economic difficulties in Turkey.
    EU goods exports to Turkey hence fell by 8.9% to ‚Ç¨77.3bn, while imports from Turkey rose by 9.1% to ‚Ç¨76.1bn. Overall trade in goods thus amounted to ‚Ç¨153.4 billion in 2018.
    EU exports to Turkey are dominated by machinery and transport material, chemical products and manufactured goods.
    Turkey's exports to the EU are mostly machinery and transport equipment, followed by manufactured goods.
    Turkey's main export markets are the EU (50%), Iraq, USA, Israel and Russia.
    Imports into Turkey come from the following key markets: the EU (36%), Russia, China, Indiaand Iran.

Same with teachers and schools, with many schools hiring Quereinsteiger (people without any teaching qualifications and often without a vetting process) because the DDR teachers are getting too old, though some are literally still teaching on the side in their seventies. And the school buildings falling apart with mold because they haven't been repaired in decades. Is that due to communism?

Same with public transport, public housing, etc. Most of these things were actually in reasonable shape, it has been neglected in the last thirty years. And by the way, even things that *were* neglected by the communists should have been fixed in the last thirty years. Not doing that is neglectful too.

Or what about jobs? There were jobs during Communism, but they collapsed along with the state in 1990, now it's underpaid shitty labour, often time-restricted, where you get 80% of what you would get for the same work in the West.

Also saying a argument based off the constitution of a nation is dumb then you clearly don't understand politics. The Constitution is the state it is a document that entrenches the values and rules of said state, if the Constitution says you can't be independent there is not much you can do without amending. 

Witch brings me to the second point there's a reason the Dayton agreement hasn't been amended in Srpska OR the federation for over 20 years now, don't you think if Dodik actually gave a shit and wasn't just collecting tax money for his 4 private property's he would have amended it by now? The constitution needs full support by ALL 3 members, Bosnian and Croats aren't just gonna sign off on that meaning any kind of constitutional amendment on separation is impossible. 

A peaceful solution to separation was tossed out the window as soon as Serbs picked up arms against civilians. As soon as they declared a national genocide against Muslims and Catholics to establish a greater Serbia they lost all support from everyone. Serbs will have to live with their loss and atrocities no matter how much the cry and complain. 

Also Serbs are the most hatted people in the region due to their long history of backstabbing and land grabbing even if the EU, and NATO somehow magically collapse you think Bulgarians, Slovens, Croats, Macedonians, Albanians, Turks, Hungarians, Bosnians, Italians, and Germans will just forget the times Serbia screwed them over and just reward Serbia for nothing allowing Serbian influence, yeah like that's gonna happen. 

The Bosnians understand the Serbs don't wanna stay they cry about it everyday, but in over 20 years the Serbs have done nothing but halt progress causing there province to match the economy of Moldova.

I think we both know that's not how it is, and many of the parties that now don't officially want to disband the EU were openly crying for exits of their own in the light of Brexit, and only changed their tune when Brexit became a disaster and the idea became unpopular. Their practical proposals though generally are things which would weaken the EU or otherwise make it less democratic and efficient.","in varietate concordia, in concordia invicta",/r/europe/comments/fct8hj/support_for_eurosceptic_parties_doubles_in_two/fjd178n/,EccentricEurocentric,1583243075
