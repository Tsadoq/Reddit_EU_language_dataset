* Every country in Europe has accepted that the coronavirus has spread beyond the  possibility of elimination 
* Every country in Europe has a certain hospital capacity 
* Deaths resulting from overwhelmed hospitals are considered preventable, deaths resulting from people who receive hospital care are not. 
* Every country has policies in place to *slow* the spread of the virus as to not have the number of sick people be higher than the number of hospital and ICU beds
* Sweden is succeeding in keeping the outbreak small enough to match its healthcare capacity. 
* Other countries had to take different, extreme, measures to save their overwhelmed healthcare systems (e.g. Italy)

Jesus Christ, you're such a petty little bitch.

One last time. You ask who promises Israel will not receive any more rockets if it withdraws from its settlements. My answer:

&gt; Whether or not Israel receives Qassam rockets, it must still withdraw its settlements. Qassam rockets are not a justification for an illegal policy of enhanced settler colonialism. Palestinian territories are de jure sovereign and not a privilege for good behavior. A military occupation can be justified for the Qassam rockets, but not population displacement and settlement [...] This is not a conditional statement. There is no guarantee [...] Palestinian territory cannot be held hostage to colonial expansion, no matter what. The matter of Qassam rockets are not relevant to the fundamental territorial sovereignty of Palestine.

1. Movistar indebted herself with 50.000.000.000 € to deploy FTTH. Let that sink in. You won't find many world ISPs that made such a risky move, maybe some way large ones in the US, but that's it.

2. Competitors are also state-backed companies for the most part, like Orange, and Vodafone really operates like one given how many state contracts they have. Movistar has state money because it's basically the only ones that apply to most bids since the early 00s basically. The other group is Euskaltel/R/Telecable.

&gt; Finally, some of the other providers are making their own efforts in fiber. Actually, with 5G in the close horizon I understand why other companies are not investing that much in fiber.

Their efforts in fiber are laughable, not to mention that they run 1/64 to 1/128 for the most part, while Movistar runs on 1/32 the standard 1/16 not rare to find, somewhat uncommon to find 1/64 and very rare to find 1/128. So the amount of overselling is not even in the same scale.

When Patton saw what the Soviets were doing to Berlin, he was horrified and (correctly) predicted that the Western Allies had merely struck down one enemy to be replaced by an even worse one.

Then when all that's done, some caution must be used when putting shrink glue tubing to ""seal"" the repaired part, because if not done properly, you'll have corroded wires in a matter of months at best.

The part about the cables also transmitting power depends on if the hub is still operating an older and pretty defunct standard which (in Iceland at least) is being retired since the majority of homes who don't have fiber access, have vdsl2+ (approx 50mbps down/25mbps up) and the users are using VoIP services, making the older standard where 48 volts were transmitted over the copper system useless.

394,"&gt; ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBERS OF RAPES BASED ON BERLIN POPULATION STATISTICS  
1. Official statistics for the period between September 1945 and August 1946 show a total of 23,124 births (both live and stillborn). Of these, approximately 5% were ""Russian children"": 1,156 children.  
2. Some 10% of the pregnant women had abortions, of which 90% were successful. Therefore, ten times as many women had actually been impregnated: 11,560.  
3. About 20% of the raped women became pregnant. Therefore, among those of childbearing age, five times as many were raped: 57,800.  
4. In 1945, 600,000 women of childbearing age (18 to 45 years) lived in Berlin. 57,800 of them were raped. That represents 9.5% of this age group.  
5. In 1945, 800,000 girls between the ages of 14 and 18 and women over 45 lived in Berlin. If one assumes that 9.5% of those in this age group were raped, that would mean that 73,300 of those younger and older women were affected. (If a 4.75% figure is used, then the number is 36,650.)  
6. Conclusions: Of the 1.4 million women and girls in Berlin, between 94,450 and 131,100-an average of more than 110,000-were raped between early summer and fall of 1945.

420,"Turkey’s battle to defend its currency against the US dollar has suffered a setback after intense selling pressure pushed the lira to a level last seen in the country’s 2018 currency crisis. 

The currency weakened past 7 to the dollar on Friday, after a long stand-off around that level. For more than a week, any shift towards 7 in the exchange rate has been met with dollar selling to prop the lira back up. This time, the dollar broke through to trade as high as TL7.04.

The lira’s slide, on a day of pressure across emerging market currencies, came after Turkey’s central bank governor, Murat Uysal, announced a new, lower inflation forecast during a press conference on Thursday.

The year-end inflation forecast was reduced from 8.2 per cent to 7.4 per cent, while the 2021 inflation projection was unchanged at 5.4 per cent. “From his remarks we understood that the central bank will continue to cut interest rates,” said Enver Erkan, an economist at Istanbul-based Tera Investments.

Economists at Citi said the “outlook is likely to be more challenging” than the central bank’s revised forecasts. Citi expects the 2020 figure to reach 13 per cent, as a result of inflation in the services sector in particular, and as a weaker currency feeds through to higher “cost-push pressures” that lift prices.

Mr Uysal also told reporters that the country was not in talks with the IMF for funding help, despite the strain Covid-19 was putting on Turkey’s public finances. 

“Erdogan refuses to ‘bow’ to the IMF, as he calls it, which is very odd because countries that haven’t been near IMF support for years such as Nigeria have all taken the money with very few conditions,” said Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank.
Delphine Arrighi, an emerging market debt manager at Merian Global Investors, said the country’s latest efforts to fight coronavirus will add to years of accumulating economic stresses. “We share widespread concerns on the Turkish lira,” she added. 

Turkey’s ability to support the lira has become increasingly constrained as the central bank burns through its foreign currency reserves. Economists and investors think the central bank is using up this war chest to defend the supposedly free-floating currency. 

Traders report that much of the selling is coming from local state-owned banks operating on the central bank’s behalf. Friday is a national holiday in Turkey, with local markets and banks closed. As a result, low trading volumes made the currency more susceptible to fluctuations.

Nonetheless, one London-based analyst, who asked not to be named, said state banks had continued in their long-running bid to prop up the currency by selling dollars in the open market, offloading as much as $300m by Friday morning in London. “They tried very hard but couldn’t stop it,” said the analyst. 

Another investor said traders were reporting more than $500m in dollar sales by local state banks.",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/gbzmzn/turkish_lira_succumbs_to_pressure_and_weakens/fp8eob2/,MelodicBerries,1588390403

Each of the ring’s four lanes has a determined “neutral speed” and is banked in such a manner that one can drive as if the road were straight. In essence, at the so-called neutral speed which is different for the four lanes, one can drive as if in a straight lane. In fact, a driver in the outer most lane doesn't need to turn the wheel while driving at speeds of up to 240 km/h.

However extremely fast cars still require the steering wheel to be turned when going faster than the maximum neutral speed.  

The neutral speed for the four car/motorcycle lanes are respectively:

545,"u/Moist1981, you're spot on. The fact that you're getting down-voted says more about the current level of informed public opinion in the UK rather than anything you wrote.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the other countries were desperate to export their populations and get rid of their burdens

Absolute nonsense with no basis in reality. Who do you see arriving in the UK from the new EU countries? Is it elderly people, like you're ""exporting"" yours to Spain? No, it's working age people, and their countries of origin are actually doing their best (incentives, social campaigns) to hold onto them or to try to get them back again. I know, because I'm from one of the few countries that has through concerted effort succeeded in reversing this trend (Estonia).

Every developed country in the world wants to have more working age people, especially ones with aging populations, as u/Moist1981 explained. If the UK is struggling to take advantage of the people they're economically very fortunate to be receiving, then that's down to your successive governments' failed social policies, not the immigration, which is a budgetary net positive to your country.

u/Casri_,

&gt;It's the average Brit who is forced to compete with the 250,000 net  annual arrivals for jobs

Studies in the UK and elsewhere have found that there is no significant negative effect from immigration to the employment level of the native population. In fact, the immigrants through their economic activity create a lot of new jobs that would otherwise never be.

Schrödinger's immigrant, eh? Manages to simultaneously take your job -and- be a burden to your society. Amazing.

&gt;\[competition for\] housing, school places for their kids and NHS  appointments

Yes, demand has gone up, but then supply should keep up. So are these problems really down to an increase in population, or perhaps instead it was the permanent gutting of local government budgets (to the degree that councils are still going bankrupt a decade later!) and chronic underfunding of the NHS? Also, the NHS and support for your aging population in general is heavily reliant on immigrant labour anyway.

Do you ever hear about the German health or school system struggling with all the working age people and their children they're receiving? Trust me, anyone who has looked past the political rhetoric and at the actual data has no doubts where the roots of these British problems lie, and experts have always known. But I did hear people have had enough of experts in this country.

u/rose98734

&gt;\&gt;they were introducing traffic congestion, overcrowding, rent and property price rises

Immigrants from the EU did all that? Or perhaps it's the fact that you've been late to start building higher-density housing that people would actually want to live in, so you're over-reliant on cars, and outside London and perhaps a few select cities your public transportation is crap? And as for the rent and property prices, that's down to a well-documented long-term housing crisis, the causes of which are many, with some going back to Thatcher, if not to your class system in general.

I know about these things because I've been living in the UK myself for a few years now, to study a joint degree in economics and human geography. Don't worry though, I'm not staying here after to be a ""burden"" to you, because the real burden is living in a country that's unfortunately suffering from poor government and some major delusions that's getting those people re-elected. It's been quite sad seeing you continually shoot yourself in the foot and keep looking back, not forward.

557,"Since you appear to be interested in the Cyprus incident, Greece (the republic) had nothing to to with it (yes you read that right).

At that time Greece had a militaristic dictatorship that was sponsored by USA (funded and endorsed). USA was afraid that Greece would turn to communism (rightfully so because right after we were freed from Nazis a civil war broke out between Democratics and Communists, which ended with a win for the Democratics with the help of the allies) so they sponsored a coup in Greece which was very successful.

Greeks wanted to be a republic again (""look for the Athens Polytechnic uprising"") and our dictators were pressured so they needed a victory, Greeks were in favor of ΕΝΟΣΙΣ (unification of Cyprus and Greece) as well as the majority of Cyprus (only about 20-25% of them were Turkish) so ΕΝΟΣΙΣ would bring Greeks back in support of junta. When they got an approval from the USA that they could sponsor their own coup in Cyprus and that USA would stand by them if Turkey tried anything they acted, as we now know USA lied. The rest is history.

Greeks as well as Cypriots wanted a peaceful unification and weren't in support for the persecution of Turks. The failure of a peaceful unification with Cyprus was one of the main reasons we managed to overthrow our dictatorship.

The current statistics show that there was a number of smaller European countries who responded quickly, decisively and they managed to keep the virus under control, to the point where they could potentially fully drop all anti-corona measures next week and all would be fine (as long as the borders stay closed, another unimaginable thing in a federation).

Unfortunately, there are some much larger countries that still believe in their wet dreams about ""herd immunity"" where people die by the hundreds every day. There are countries that waited more than a month since their first case until they even started to address the matter.

You say ""joint responses"". Who decides on those joint responses in a federation? The bigger countries, like the one that voted itself out of the EU or those that have the biggest death rates in the entire EU (coincidentally, the same countries who could potentially destroy € with their unsustainable economies).

No one really speaks ""standard Swedish"". It's fairly close to what is spoken around Stockholm I suppose, but without the identifiable characteristics of actual Stockholm dialects. I think it's a sort of compromise between many different central Swedish accents, who are all relatively close to it (and everyone understands). While far to the north and far to the south things can get a bit weird. 

Everyone think everyone else has a silly dialect though. Like pretty much the rest of Sweden think people in Stockholm talk weird, and vice versa. It's not just a rural thing or something like that. Younger generations are often closer towards ""standard Swedish"", but most still keep the basics of their local dialect, it's not like the completely change how they talk.

It is not allowed to simply take territory from a country and give to another solely due to ethnicity. This is why the nation ""Kosovo"" exists - a pseudo-state created with the sole thought of uniting with Albania in the future. With that logic, most of Bosnia and part of Croatia should be Serbian due to Jasenovac war crimes during second world war and Serbian majority. 

Minority rights are a fundamental part of Serbia as minorities are present everywhere and most of them live in harmony with each other except for the Albanians, who still, after all, are given everything as they are allowed to set up bakeries all over Serbia. Funny how every minority in the Kosovo region feels oppressed by the Albanians. Ask the Gorani and the Serbs and see if they really want to be a part of a pseudo multi ethnic nation.

""Kosovo"" should not surrender sovereignty cause they were never sovereign in the first place.

&gt; Whether or not Israel receives Qassam rockets, it must still withdraw its settlements. Qassam rockets are not a justification for an illegal policy of enhanced settler colonialism. Palestinian territories are de jure sovereign and not a privilege for good behavior. A military occupation can be justified for the Qassam rockets, but not population displacement and settlement [...] This is not a conditional statement. There is no guarantee [...] Palestinian territory cannot be held hostage to colonial expansion, no matter what. The matter of Qassam rockets are not relevant to the fundamental territorial sovereignty of Palestine. You cannot justify a colonial project in Palestine under the premise of security.

Edit: you deleted your answer but I wrote a wall.. I did not want to discard all that:

""Algeria is the second country in the world in terms of wheat imports (Behind Egypt). It only produces 70% of the food they eat. They usually rely on their oil exportation (declining as peak has passed now + at 25$/barrel as of today) to finance their food imports. Russia stopped its wheat exports for this year. There is a rather high probability Europe will face a new drought this summer due to climate change. This + Covid19 impact, there is a quite high probability food price will rise quite sharply over there and you then won't manufacture anything with the civil unrest that it will induce... Hungry people do not work, they revolt. Then you got Venezuela or Syria.

When I say put a remind me I take a bet that has a quite high probability to happen over the coming year but, mark my words, there is a 100% of probability that it happens in the next 10 years. 40m (still rising) people living in a desert with oil production declining + climate change = bloodbath""",,/r/europe/comments/gbd87b/population_density_in_europe/fp7s6q6/,jimkoons,1588376690

695,"&gt; Japan had hoped to fight off one super power in the US on their own soil. They knew they had no chance to fight off two. Also after they lost Manchuria they had nothing left to fight for


Japan surrendered for 2 reasons:

 (1) they had been militarily crushed in every land battle they had fought with the US. The emperor had no reason to think they would have any more luck when the US invaded the main islands. The US had already started invading the outer Japanese islands. There was a pattern to these battles like in the battle of Okinawa in April of 1945 where 20,000 Americans were killed and 100,000 Japanese troops died. 

(2) they were starving to death because the US had already bombed the shit out of the country and destroyed all their industry by bombing Japanese cities and had cut off all trade with Japan by destroying all their naval and trading ships. By the time the Soviets entered the war the Japanese literally didn’t have any oil left. The US bombers which dropped the atomic bombs weren’t even accompanied by escort fighters because Japan didn’t have any planes left to intercept them. 

Both of these were because of the US. The Soviet Union never threatened the Japanese home islands because the Soviets didn’t have a navy that could invade japan. Japan surrendered because the US had a huge navy that they knew was going to invade Japan and the US had already started atomic bombing them and also reducing their cities to rubble with conventional bombings.

707,"&gt; Btw... you know who else ""counteracted"" attraction to the US job market after WW2? The US. Look up the Marshall Plan. 

The US did not care about attracting immigrants. They had more than enough people for growth, but because they had a prosperous and growing economy at the time; whether they tried or not they attracted immigrants anyway. Their priority was making sure Europe did not fall to the soviet union dictatorship. European governments were worried about soviets and if the US was as trustworthy as they presented themselves, while also worrying about their own people leaving their ruined country.

&gt;I can't believe that you are this thick... you're either tying to spread lies, or you have been lied to.

You don't understand the message that is blatantly laid out throughout my writing, so I will ask you again. If socialists are majorly responsible for the upliftment of workers then where are they now? With workers around the world suffering from exploitation and many workers having their rights eroded in the western world; it would seem that it would be the right time for them to show up again. 

If socialists are these powerful and gifted beings able to see when workers are suffering and able to fight back against capitalistic governments, inspire the workers to rise up and remove their shackles, you would think that we wouldn't have plateaued in growth of the middle classes, and eliminated the depression of poverty. In the end geopolitics and international competition was always more of a major factor in the rise of the working class then whatever these socialists have done. Unfortunate, as it is. Turns out, you either need the government to cooperate if you are to get what legislation you want enacted or you need to become the government yourself.

Back then, both continents competed for growth in various ways. With the rise of industry and incomes, and an ever growing domestic population, many politicians studied on how to best use the human resources they had available to them. What they found out is that taking care of your population and not putting them through stressful exploitation really helps economic growth and the growth of innovation needed to compete with others. You want able, intelligent, and innovative people you have to solve their economic and social problems, so they can prioritize what you want them to. 

Now with such an expansive and global economy, the rise of ever expansive corporations, and the modern mode of transportation allowing hundreds of thousands of hopeful immigrants every year to go into an country, eager to be exploited because they came from even less, there is no need to take care of your population in such a way to foster growth and innovation. If they waste away and die under horrible working and living conditions; no matter, hundreds of thousands outside will be able to take their place. No capitalist or government body has an incentive to take care of their domestic population like before when they can just roll over the pile of dead broken bodies with more people. 

The socialists have nothing to fight against such a thing, they will never be able to convince the government, and they will never be let in by the establishment either. They are a hopeless group with no solutions that rely on internet memes to feel they are fighting back against the depression ahead of them.

If don't read political works analytically and critically, you're just trying to confirm biases you already held. 

&gt;  I know you want to read it in that quote, but it's just not there. The funny thing is, why chose that quote in particular?

I'm not going to waste my time dismantling Marx's entire sophistry here. I just focused on what I believe to be important. The critical question is: why is Marx legitimizing communism, his utopia, with the same arguments that he delegitimized religion with? 

There's only two viable answers. Either Marx unintentionally discredited his own ideas with this contradiction, or he is signaling to an attentive reader that communism is to serve the role that religion held under the capitalist order. We assume the latter, because the former would render his work completely pointless. 

&gt; And how would an anarchist have worded a critique on religious focus on afterlife differently? Because I don't see how the quote couldn't have come from an anarchist.

Anarchists believe the utopia can be achieved within a single lifetime. Marx specifically criticizes anarchists because they don't seek an intermediate phase, socialism. Marx goes through great lengths trying to discredit anarchism because their intentions are more genuine than his. 

The anarchist critique of religion would be similar. The difference is that they would not suggest the utopia is something that cannot be achieved until an indefinite period of time in the far future.",Einsiedelmann,/r/europe/comments/gb48zs/happy_may_1st_international_workers_day/fp6yl3x/,Fredfredbug4,1588360860

939,"Some points worth noting:


* The bats that carry the virus live in two provinces (Zhejiang or Yunnan), the closest being 900km away. Bats wouldn't be transported that far just for a small market, and the caves they live in are not easily accessed). If they really wanted to eat bats there would have been other kinds that were much closer

* There's [no evidence](https://img-prod.tgcom24.mediaset.it/images/2020/02/16/114720192-5eb8307f-017c-4075-a697-348628da0204.pdf) that the wet market (a seafood market) sold bats (or pangolins)

* Chinese experts stated that the first known SARS-CoV-2 patient had [no connection to the wet market](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext#bib35) blamed for the outbreak, and neither did a third of the cases in the first cluster. Once it infected someone in the market, it spread rapidly

* SARS-CoV-1 leaked out of a lab in Beijing [four times](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/20/18260669/deadly-pathogens-escape-lab-smallpox-bird-flu)

* US officials reported in 2018 that the level 4 lab in Wuhan (the WIV) had [""a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/14/state-department-cables-warned-safety-issues-wuhan-lab-studying-bat-coronaviruses/), and warned that their work on the coronavirus risked a new SARS pandemic. This lab is approx 14km away from the market

* The Wuhan Centre for Disease Control (a less secure level 2 lab), was also working with the bat coronaviruses and was approx 3km away from the market

* SARS-CoV2 is [extremely similar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095418/) to a virus discovered in a cave in Yunnan, which is also believed to be the origin of SARS-CoV1. Again, this is a vast distance from Wuhan (approx 1700km). These were the types of bat viruses being researched in Wuhan

This is not to say the virus *did* leak out of a lab (and I doubt it was bio-engineered), but I think the 'wet market' theory was just an excuse by China as there doesn't seem to be any evidence for it.

1018,"rapes in Germany, which lasted until the winter of 1947–1948. Nazi-German forces had been responsible for killing and killing millions of people in the Soviet Union after being attacked there in the summer of 1941. In addition to millions of fallen soldiers, as many as 13 million Soviet civilians died. Soviet soldiers had to witness horrific destruction as they recaptured their land from the occupiers. Arriving at the German border in late 1944, Red Army soldiers had the opportunity to retaliate. German civilians were now the victims. On APRIL 30, 1945, Demmin was in front of the Red Army. The small town was located 200 kilometers east of Berlin, surrounded by three rivers on a headland. Retracted German troops had blown up river bridges, trapping the city’s 15,000 residents and thousands of refugees flooded there. Before the first Soviet soldiers had arrived in the city, 21 of its inhabitants had already died. As victims of suicide. This was just the beginning of a nightmare in which an estimated thousand residents and refugees killed themselves in three days. Soviet soldiers managed to block only a few suicide attempts. Whole families killed themselves, mothers tied their little children to themselves with ropes before they drowned in rivers, rocks full of rocks on their backs. Occupied by fires and Soviet troops, an uninterrupted stream of desperate women and their children fled. Lotte-Lore Martens testified to the horror scene from the cemetery hill: “The smoke was accompanied by countless raped women, some of whom still had plenty of blood, holding one, two, three, some four children in a trance, staring blankly, swaying along Jarmener Chaussee. Sooner or later we saw them turn right in the direction of the Tollensejoki. It was impossible to stop them. Joukkopsykoosi. So they were going to die in the water. The horrors of DEMMIN were repeated in numerous towns and villages along eastern Germany. By the end of the year alone, more than 7,000 suicides had been committed in Berlin alone, 4,000 of whom were women. In Eastern and Central Europe, the female population experienced blatant horrors under the occupying powers. An estimated two million women were raped in Soviet-occupied areas. In Berlin alone, at least 100,000 women were victims of rape, of whom an estimated 10,000 died as a result. At least tens of thousands of women were also raped in the occupying territories of Western forces. The rape continued in the East until the winter of 1947–1948, when soldiers were finally permanently stationed in barracks. - It was the biggest mass rape in history, summed up the British historian Antony Beevor, whose books are banned in modern Russia. The rape began as early as the end of 1944, when the Red Army reached the eastern border of the territories annexed to Germany. In late October, the Red Army briefly captured the small border village of Nemmersdorf in East Prussia. The Germans soon ousted the Soviet troops, but they left behind a number of killed German civilians. According to the Nazis, 72 women, aged 8 to 84, had been raped and killed. Goebbels' propaganda machinery took everything out of the case and consciously tried to incite the people's will to defend by emphasizing the horrors of Nemmersdorf. But at the same time, panic spread among the civilian population, which contributed to the occurrence of massacres like Demmin. The rapes continued as the Allies progressed deeper into German-occupied territories. The victims were not always civilians. Even concentration camp prisoners and Russian and Polish women transferred to forced labor by the Germans were raped after they were first released by Soviet forces. The Red Army leadership allegedly knew about the crimes. According to Beevor, the Russian general reported on the mass rapes of Soviet women released in Moscow, but at the same time urged Moscow to ensure that women did not spread negative issues about the Red Army upon their return to the Soviet Union. BEEVOR points out that not all Soviet soldiers really raped. However, the actions were made possible by the Red Army’s poor discipline in the later stages of the war. Poorly trained soldiers had joined the ranks of the army, which had suffered horrific loss of men, and in the heat of victory and intoxication did what they wanted when the officers did not dare to stop them. When the Yugoslav communist, partisan leader Milovan Djilas, complained to Stalin about the crimes committed by Soviet forces in Yugoslavia, he is said to have replied that “if a soldier has fought through thousands of miles of blood and fire, he has the right to have some fun with women”. THIS is how a Soviet officer reminded Svetlana Alexeyevich, a Belarusian, Nobel Prize-winning author, in the 1980s: “We were so young and strong, but we were four years without a woman. So we tried to catch German women and then ... ten men raped.
There were not enough women because everyone had fled the Soviet army. So we had to take that young girl, 12 or 13 years old. If he tried to scream, we would put something in his mouth. We thought it was fun. Now I can’t understand why I did that. I am, after all the son of a good family ... but I it still was. Ethnic cleansing continued until 1950. From the end of the WAR until 1950, 12 to 14 million ethnically German-speaking civilians were deported from Eastern and Central European countries. About 7 million Germans moved to the West, including in the Soviet and Polish regions, and about 3.5 million from Czechoslovakia. Ethnic cleansing has been described as one of the greatest in European history. In the 1960s, the West German government estimated that some 2 million German refugees died of disease and malnutrition as a result of the deportations.",,/r/europe/comments/gbjx15/it_was_historys_widest_grouprape_in_spring_1945/fp653dt/,Subject-View,1588346228

There is a second group, however. The educated intelligentsia like him. Marx never labored a day in his life. He came from a wealthy family, abandoned it to become a writer, and then mooched off of Engels, a factory owner, who was sympathetic to his ideas. 

To this second group, the group that is educated enough to see past the romantic picture of a better world that he is painting, recognizes the parallel. The bourgeoisie used religion to control the proletariat. To overthrow the bourgeoisie, a new method of control must be established. That method of control is communism.

&gt;The Norwegian Directorate of Health introduced a number of measures from Thursday 12 March 2020:

&gt;All educational institutions were closed and organized sports activities were to be discontinued.

&gt;A number of events and businesses were closed, including cultural events, sports events, gyms and swimming pools. All establishments in the hospitality industry such as bars, pubs and clubs other than those serving food were to close, and any establishment serving food would have to ensure that visitors could stay at least 1 meter apart.

&gt;As of 19 March, residents were prohibited from staying in cabins outside their home municipalities, in order to avoid putting strain on rural medical infrastructure. People suspected or confirmed to be infected must follow stricter home isolation rules. The government established fines for people violating home quarantine and home isolation rules or organizing events.

Besides, prices increasing is a normal phenomenon in capitalism. That's how businesses boost their revenue.

1203,"&gt;The problem is that Bulgaria is simply too poor. 

This is oversimplification to the extreme. What are the specific obstacles that this ""poverty"" brings when it comes to adopting the euro?

&gt;In hindsight, letting in so many countries was a mistake in the early years and one many in the richer North are not willing to make again. 

If anything, the later adopters have been the least of an headache for the euro area. Bulgaria would be more similar to Slovakia or Lithuania than Greece or Italy.

&gt;What guarantee is there that Bulgaria won't be like that in 10-15 years time? You need several decades of continuity and stability - and rising incomes. Still too early. 

Almost all EU members are legally obliged to adopt the euro as soon as they meet the criteria. It would be absolutely illogical to start obstructing the process on such abstract reasoning, even more so when appetite for joining the euro area is so small that it's a wonder any country is even joining.

It's not an instruction manual for anything, it's a sheer endless list of capitalism's inadequacies that need to be addressed. Then there's a single pamphlet theorizing about how you might start addressing those issues that has aged very poorly and isn't essential to his work, but short enough for people to actually read it. 

Das Kapital is as relevant today as during its writing, since the issues pointed out haven't been addressed or studied with enough detail to make Das Kapital irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether you want to improve or replace capitalism, Das Kapital should be your first lecture so you understand what problems you'll be dealing with. 

The real issue is coming up with solutions once you know the problems and that's where most people fail spectacularly.

&gt; […]
&gt; only very few universities talked about x% of recent graduates getting employed in their field.

How exactly is that “cheating” though? There are lots of fields
of study that lack a well define career trajectory after graduation.
Strictly speaking, a master’s at a university is a research degree
but only a small number of graduates actually end up being 
employed in research. The situation is even more absurd in
fields like chemistry where a PhD is considered the minimum
for employability in industry but most jobs aren’t in R&amp;D.

Do you really expect these people to not count against the
employed graduates stats just because they didn’t end up
becoming researchers? Granted, there are some professions
like medicine where university equals job training. But for

1407,"I think you're not all wrong, but I also think you're misinterpreting some signals.

First of all, the political context of this virus is entirely different to previous situations. Xi Jinping has appointed himself as 'supreme leader' and as such, he's been establishing his power for the last few years. That changes the situation from the CCP to more of an individual authoritarian leadership. There's no doubt that there are people within the CCP who are not too happy with this, because they thought they might've been next in line to be elected chairman in the future.

Probably for that same reason, China has been escalating their behaviour for the past few years. Through that vicious cycle they've created a more hostile international environment for themselves.

Combine that together and you have potential internal political unrest and more need than ever for China to appear strong in the international theatre. Meanwhile, the Chinese people have seriously suffered from this virus and given the shape of the world, China's economy could be in or headed towards the worst shape in decades. All of that is a potential threat to Xi's power. Xi does what pretty much any authoritarian leader does in that situation, he strikes back in a show of force.

 Unlike other states of the union, Italian has a form of unhealthy patriotism, because it sees the country divided between north and south, with a formula of indifference between the two sides, which does not lead to the creation of a compact identity as in other countries. 

Im agreed, we are not in the third world and luckily we have many things that create well-being, like a public health system, but we manage certain things not in an excellent way. we are also one of the major countries with ""brain escape"" so many young people prefer to leave, because they don't believe in Italy

 As far as my personal vision is concerned (and therefore it is an extremely subjective concept) I believe in my country, I was lucky enough to travel and see other realities and I would never change what is home to me, we have sectors in which we are monsters like fashion and we have tourism that other states dream of, but we do not always manage everything well, and from one thing that could give us 100 we actually earn 10.

1442,"Today we have one from China that killed. 

If tommorow, a pandemic started in Ireland, and killed a third of a million Chinese nationals, forcing them to shut down the economy for months on end causing 20%+ unemployment, and China wanted to ask Ireland how exactly that happened? Was it mismanaged biotechnology, given Ireland's massive biomedical industry? Was it the unhygienic and crowded farmers markets we have? Poorly processed meat?

With that amount of damage, and an obvious country of origin, China has every right to investigate Ireland's standards, practices and regulations that lead to such deviation. It's in China's interest to do so, and if Ireland refuses, Ireland would look downright evil.

But when the roles are reversed, somehow it's unacceptable to investigate? Because international events originating from a country aren't worth investigating because, it would hurt Xi Jinping's feelings, I guess? Yeah, about as much as investigating mad cow disease would hurt Queen Elizabeth's. 

If there was nothing they could do, fine, but to know that, there must be an investigation. Because, big surprise, to most people, and remember, the EU is a democracy made of democracies, life is more important than some vague, undefined idea of sovereignty preventing us from knowing why our loved ones are dying. A country's pride is not worth that, nor is the EU's. If wanting answers to relevent questions that could save lives somehow infringes sovereignty, then the idea of sovereignty needs to be disposed of. It's killing. It's killed. It will kill again.

No? Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina have negligible oil reserves.

Most of Romania's oil reserves are in Wallachia. Taking Bessarabia and Bukovina was purely about reestablishing the Russian Empire.

1630,"So you prefer to keep refugees in a authoritarian nation? I see Europeans complaining on how Turkey is also very authoritarian. Look my point is, Europe is showing its colors with its double standards. Turkey cannot support this many refugees. It's economy isn't viable for that, Turkey isn't responsible for holding the refugees either, it can't force people to stay in Turkey also, especially non-citizens.

The border area is also marked high risk because it's close to a active military zone. People love to think how the refugees are in Turkey and that they are safe but a majority of these refugees still live really close to the Syrian border, the refugees cannot be looked after effectively because it's a huge logistical problem that Turkey has a hard time affording. Now don't say that Turkey received money from Europe because where that money goes should be investigated but probably never will be.

Turkey has active terrorist organizations in its borders, so it is technically at war, there is no natural disaster currently but this refugee crisis is another disaster in it's self. It's easy for European citizens to say ""They entered Turkey a some what safe country so they should stay in Turkey"" but turn a blind eye when their said country is supporting and aiding organizations in a country furthering the displacement of people.

&gt;That wasn't diplomacy, it was just invasion.

ALL WAR IS INVASION.......that is where we start, that is the baseline when talking about war, that IS the implication

if it isn't an invasion, we add qualifiers to the word war, like cold/economic/attrition etc

what happens before that is usually called ""diplomacy"" and it's usually failed is if it leads too war

those with power in any negotiation will have the balance in their favor so usually ultimatums are given, are you serioulsy saying that any power as the USSR was is actually doing ""diplomacy"" anywhere in the world even today?

by the mere virtue of their power there is implied coercion (edit: aka **soft power)**

&amp;#x200B;

it is what America does, it is what England did etc

the fact that the ""diplomacy"" part wasn't very ""diplomatic"" is a moral bias

1677,"Crying about how Turks are forcing refugees to the Greek border and forcefully trying to make them go to Europe then saying safety is #1 for refugees does that make sense? I don't think someone would feel safe or would be safe if they are forced to do something.

Bullshit arguments you're talking how safety is important, and I'm telling you how Turkey isn't safe. What is today opposite day? If a someone said Turkey is much safer than France you'd see complaints how that is false. What now Turkey is safe enough for poor refugees?

So it's not a money problem you just don't want refugees in your country and prefer them in another country. Explain why Turkey should want these refugees, refugees go until they find safety. A strained system is not good for anyone which is what Turkey has.

Tell me this, if Turkey closed it's borders and didn't let a single refugee in. Would you be talking the way you are talking or would you be complaining how Turkey is evil and this is just another Friday for the Turks? Do you literally not see any double standards in this. Do you genuinely believe that Europe does not have double standards in this situation?

What ever Turks do its never good enough. They let refugees in, but when those refugees leave they're the bad guys. They don't let refugees in they're the bad guys.

Edit: I'll be honest, I don't care about Turkey much as you can see from my flair I live in the USA, but what pisses me off is how Europeaners like your self see yourself as right and all of a sudden see Turkey worthy enough of doing something and that It's not Europes problem. Then claiming to be a advanced society but then not doing everything you can to stop refugees from entering Europe. Like you said it's not a money problem so Europe shouldn't have any troubles taking care of these refugees. Don't pretend to be the good guy when you're hiding behind statements like ""They're immigrants not refugees"" when in fact I'm wiling to bet its a racially motivated statement.

Like the labour conditions in your country in the 19th century, what societies were like then and how hard trade unions and individuals fought to better the lives for most of the contemporaries. Entitlement is not equal with communism or it shouldn't be equated with it. If in doubt, it is your stock-holders who ship your job, source of your livelihood, to Vietnam or Laos, where labor is even cheaper then it used to be in China. And those people´s conditions are much worse than yours. International solidarity is one of the only ways out of the current globalization mess. Unless you organize, no one cares about you. And please also think about the person who sowed your US-$ 1 T-Shirt in India or Bangladesh. Those people have needs and dreams just like me and you but are truly xxxxxed for life.

1741,"&gt;You're talking about authoritarian regimes' insensitivites to peoples suffering and diffrent countries' work cultures... 

Japan and South Korea are not authoritarian regimes unlike China. Also, ""different work cultures"" is just another word for exploitation in the context we are talking about. 


Most of Europe's expansion in a welfare system was developed as a competition between the US and Europe for workers during the early 20th century. After WW2, with Europe devastated,  governments enacted policies that increased welfare and workers rights in an attempt to counteract any attraction the US job market had over European citizens who had lost so much and did not have much left to keep them in Europe.

 Socialists get to act like they were the biggest part of that development, ,but where are they now? Welfare is being cut in pieces years over years in western European countries and they are standing by, what are they waiting for?

The workers rights that are eroding? The UK, France, and Sweden all had more generous workers rights in the 90s than what they have at the moment. I wouldn't be surprised if other European countries are also declining in worker rights and welfare. If anything, the socialist movement is sitting on decaying laurels that they didn't deserve in the first place. The socialists have not even done close to enough to guarantee all people and their descendants a better living.

 They think they are solely responsible for the workers rights and welfare expansion that happened in most countries after WW2. In hindsight, it was self-conscious governments themselves who put most actual legislation into action for fear of losing even more workers immigrating to the US after they suffered severe economic losses during ww2. So some politicians upped the ante on workers welfare and rights to others in parliament  to compete with the wealthy US job market. It was easy for socialists back then to say they were responsible since they were the loudest and most demanding even if their efforts did not affect things much without European politicians fearing the attraction of US job market towards their own constituents.

There are countless other examples like that.

&gt;which is what gives wiggle room for current communist and fascist parties to still operate there. 

It would be no problem for communist parties to operate in Germany in theory since the GG doesn't fix a economic system and communism is compatible with human dignity. Fascist parties? not so much. 

Yeah, the NPD were not banned despite being in clear contrast to it because in the first attempt, the influence of the Verfassungsschutz were too big and in the second attempt the constitutional court deemed them to unimportant in their current form.

However we have currently a fascist party in our parliaments who is quite openly against our constitution.

&gt;the forces of Capital have illegally undermined every single Socialist movement in history

lol.. no the forces of Capital have intrinsically opposed every single socialist movement in history, but every single socialist movement itself has been internally fragile and most have been abhorrently violent because Socialism is inherently flawed and built on a completely false premise. This is becoming incredibly tangential as you can't really help but bring up you cultist warship (see what I did there, classified you as a cult just like you did to the people getting their kidneys confiscated from them). The topic at hand here is that the CCP is largely at fault. I don't give a damn if you worship them for their pseudosocialism or whatever tf it is you have going for them.

&gt;Do you know why children are given word limits when they are asked to write? They lack the critical thinking skills to decide what is and what isn’t necessary to further their argument; clearly you skipped schools those days.

Your army getting openly bombed, tens of soldiers killed, erdogan talked big about his ""big opeartion"" and ""back to the sochi lines"" ended up a half ass assault against a town that was taken back a few days later, and a humilating ceasefire for Turkey, Turkish observation posts surrounded and the SAA giving up absolutely zero gains, just setting up the conditions for another offensive in the future. Neo-ottoman ambitions crushed, Turkey and Erdogan humiliated, and now Turkey is fighting against the groups it was funding and protecting, a shit show of a situation for the wannabe superpower of the region.

Sure, but knowing is one thing, and having an official legal court decision is something completely different. It's much harder to ignore than knowledge.

&gt; It's unlikely that this was a war crime, but simply a mistake.

Mistakes like that still may qualify as war crimes depending on the interpretation of the Geneva Convention and other international laws. But even if this particular case will not be seen as a war crime eventually, a legal decision about Russia waging war in Ukraine could open the way for investigations of actual war crimes which Russians did commit for sure in Ukraine.

2168,"&gt; You implied that the US is some foreign power poised to invade the Netherlands, I view things very differently

No, I said the US passed a law to invade the Netherlands should we try their war criminals. If China did so, I'm sure you would be outraged, but because the US passed such a law it's A-OK?

&gt;The US is our strongest military ally and has no track record of hostile actions against any democratic European nation, instead, they have a track record of aiding the democratic nations of Europe.

First off, that does not make them not a bad faith actor. Just because they are supposedly allies of the Netherlands doesn't absolve them of *any* of their crimes. 

Secondly, they don't have a track record of hostile actions against democratic European countries? The US directly meddled in the elections of Greece, Germany, Italy, Albania, France, etc. Just to give you an example of how the US acts in Europe, here is an example of a US president talking to a Greek ambassador in response to the amassador saying that Greece will never support partitioning Cyprus with Turkey:

&gt;[""Fuck your Parliament and your Constitution. America is an elephant. Cyprus is a flea. If these two fleas continue itching the elephant, they may just get whacked by the elephant's trunk, whacked good.... We pay a lot of good American dollars to the Greeks, Mr. Ambassador. If your Prime Minister gives me talk about Democracy, Parliament and Constitutions, he, his Parliament and his Constitution may not last very long... Maybe Greece should rethink the value of a parliament which could not take the 'right' decision.""](https://books.google.com/books?id=d_Kua_fO8WoC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196)

The US apparently thinks that they have a right to split up European countries however they like.

Or how about letting Americans kill European citizens and then helping them escape justice?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalese_cable_car_disaster_(1998)

&gt;The Cavalese cable car disaster of 1998, also called the Strage del Cermis (""Massacre at Cermis"") occurred on 3 February 1998, near the Italian town of Cavalese, a ski resort in the Dolomites some 40 km (25 mi) northeast of Trento. Twenty people died when a United States Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler aircraft, while flying too low, against regulations, in order for the pilots to ""have fun"" and ""take videos of the scenery"", cut a cable supporting a gondola of an aerial tramway. Joseph Schweitzer, one of the two American pilots, confessed in 2012 that he had burned the tape containing incriminating evidence upon returning to the American base. The pilot, Captain Richard J. Ashby, and his navigator, Captain Joseph Schweitzer, were put on trial in the U.S. and found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide. Later they were found guilty of obstruction of justice and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman for having destroyed a videotape recorded from the plane, and were dismissed from the Marine Corps. The disaster, and the subsequent acquittal of the pilots, strained relations between the U.S. and Italy.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Calipari

&gt;Nicola Calipari was an Italian major general and SISMI military intelligence officer. Calipari was killed by American soldiers while escorting a recently released Italian hostage, journalist Giuliana Sgrena, to Baghdad International Airport. During the 1990s, he was involved in several rescues of people kidnapped by 'Ndrangheta and other criminal organisations. He had spent most of his career in the Italian police, rising to a senior position, before joining the Italian military Security and Intelligence Service (SISMI) two years before his death.


https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/130447

&gt;Teo Peter, one of Romania's best known and most beloved rock musicians, was killed on December 4, 2004, in a Bucharest car accident involving the taxi he was riding in and the official Embassy vehicle being driven in the early morning hours by former Bucharest Marine detachment commander Staff Sgt. Christopher Van Goethem. Van Goethem departed Romania within a few hours after the accident, under the terms of his diplomatic immunity, but many Romanians viewed his abrupt departure before local investigators had the opportunity to question him and conduct tests on his blood alcohol level as a slap in the face and an effort to shield the Marine from justice. Demonstrations were held outside the Embassy, and an effort was made to rename a nearby street after the deceased musician. Sgt. Van Goethem did subsequently face a range of charges in the U.S. military justice system. A military courts martial concluded in January 2006 that while he was guilty of making false statements and obstructing justice, he was not guilty of the more serious negligent homicide charge. The jury, somewhat unexpectedly, limited the Marine's punishment to an official letter of reprimand. This news brought, in turn, another wave of protests.

Or what about the US continuously trying to undermine European laws and our industry or committing crimes on European soil? Or how about the US, like China, [committing mass industrial espionage against us?](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2013/06/28/the-nsa-and-cias-dilemma/) They're literally stealing our trade secrets and giving them to US corporations.

 &gt;I want the best geopolitical outcome for Europe, China is increasingly positioning itself as an adversary. They're fundamentally authoritarian and keep pushing the limit.

Good, I want the best outcome for Europe as well. Being fundamentally authoritarian is irrelevant to Europeans, cause we don't live in China. Their domestic system is irrelevant to us.

&gt;We (Europe) should partner with the USA to isolate China, we have shared interests. 

We also have shared interests with China. Both the US and China are bad faith actors. We should cooperate with them where it benefits us and act against them where it doesn't. You seem to want to make Europe an American vassal instead.

&gt;Wars many European nations are active participants in and share responsibility for. 

Absolutely.

&gt;America is not perfect, it needs an economic counterweight in a prosperous EU single market

""Not perfect"" is quite an understatement. It's directly responsible for the deaths of millions of people. And it doesn't just need an economic counterweight, it needs a military one as well.

&gt;yet they're incredibly powerful 

So is China.

&gt;and a historical ally

I disagree, their history in Europe is extremely shady if you read a bit about it. Giving countries money so they buy your products, placing your military there to protect your interests, and bribing/threatening politicians to do what you say is exactly what China is doing in Africa.

&gt;Not working with them on shared interests would be idiotic.

I wanted to add a little anecdote to that. When I studied, cash was scarce. Go and earn your own, my father told me, so I did. The best pay in town was at a chemical factory. I was doing really shitty labor there. And was the only german in my shift. That alone taught me something. After a while, I made friends with my work-mates who then took me to bad parts of town, where rent was cheap, dwellings poor and again - few germans there. The restaurants they took me to catered to the needs of ""locals"", foreign workers, who missed home. My favorite turned out to be a greek taverna that served lots of meatless dishes.Names? I forgot. But I will never forget the pork-roast in lemon-sauce with steemed potatoes and spinach. Darn, that was good food. Most of those places ""turned"" with the years and cater to german audiences now.

Germans saw how bad the soviet soldiers (occupation forces) were treated by their own country and officer. The fact that a few years after the war the living conditions for germans were better than for the soviet winners, did not even cause Schadenfreude. It just caused a feeling of being pity.

Soviet soldiers of the occupation forces were not really welcome by east germans because there were a lot of troubles with drunken privates stealing. But even that was somehow accepted as the Germans knew what happened to them in the barracks.

""Communism naturally leads to totalitarianism"", ""more communism is worse"", ""more capitalism = freer aka better"". One could just as loosely say that more capitalism leads to extreme indignities towards working people, only aiming to maximize profit for mega-corporations and owners thus naturally leading to people also starving etc. It's not quite as simple as that and that over-simplification is quite cringy.

It isn't a linear system where in one side you have capitalism with a (+) and then on the other you have communusm with a (-)  and the more you close to one side the better it is and the more you close to the other side the worse it is. That's a fallacy. Capitalist regimes with social benefits are not socialist as you said but they're definitely more to the left than absolute capitalism and they're way better systems. The Paris Commune albeit very short-lived was better than some right dictatorships. 

You use the ""Russia prosecuted minorities"" argument in order to blame these incidents on communism and then you use a completely flawed logic of ""more capitalism = good so Turkey didn't exterminate millions because of capitalism"" in order to escape your first mentality even though both those incidents are unrelated to the regime. 

&gt; The Western commies I see here are the exact same trash as the murderous commies of my country. They're incessantly lying, gaslighting, denying crimes, manipulating, they have no respect for the human lives their ideology has taken or could take. They are completely incapable of self-reflection and are as propagandistic as you could get. 

If you can't see how that paragraph could also be used the other way around for some right-wingers then you're too far lost inside your anti-communist propaganda man. I mean, sheesh read what you're typing again. You're bagging people that might be following certain ideals as they were written, not as they were executed in some countries, to describe them like that. This is exactly why i object to such generalizations. I happen to know people in the ""west"" that are communist but don't advocate for totalitarianism or the shit the USSR did but you'd hate them just the same because somehow in your head ""commies naturally become like that"". 

The funny thing is that they could also say that same thing about you cause in that part you sound a lot like some right-wingers we had over here that were fans of the Greek Junta (a military dictatorship) that hated all leftists, commies etc. Now don't get me wrong, i'm assuming you're not exactly like that and you'd probably object to that it's funny that you'd object and yet you show no sign of giving the benefit of doubt towards communists that might stick to the actual theory which isn't evil, and they aren't the reincarnation of Stalin or support his policies :)

One of the aim of the rebel groups that the Syrian government have been fighting against is the eradicate the Shia/Alawite presence in the region. Moreover, sectarianism does not explain everything for sure. The Alawitism might be a brunch of Shia, but it is actually very much unorthodox and completely different than regular Sunni/Shia Islam. So the idea that Hezbollah acted with sectarian motive is not true at all. Let alone everything, there are Sunni groups that are fighting with the government such as Al-Quds Brigades. Also  the government forces are not formed entirely Alawites. It is much more diverse and there are Alawite, Sunni, Durzi and Christian presence in the army.

2323,"&gt; I wonder if you know how many Germans were killed ny the nazis. Youre also wrong to think that the clear wehrmacht myth and nazism = Germany is anywhere near the same thing.

Sure, they killed some Germans, but the majority of Germans supported that. 

&gt; Just looking at the historical evidence and statistics shows how wrong you are. How many % of all living Germans, including children, do you think voted for Hitler?

Enough to make him chancellor. There was no resistance or even opposition in Germany during the Nazi years, so even if all people didn’t vote for him directly, enough supported him, or at least tolerated him. Also, you are doing the same mistake again, Nazi Germany wasn’t only Hitler. It was a vast popular movement. 

&gt; Its strange how you people dont realize what youre doing by making these statements. Youre enforcing a ""us vs them"" sentiment. ""All Germans are responsible for the crimes commited by any German"" is what youre saying.

No, the people living in Germany today were either too young or not yet born during the war. They are not responsible in the slightest. This was not the case in the 50’s, 60’s or 70’s, which is why this myth was “needed”. 

&gt; Even if 99% of Germany was fascist and nazis, your sentiment would be incredibly harmful. Becausw it will lead to that 1% of innocent Germans (children for example) being grouped together with criminals, and you and your sentiment encourages punishing those children for the deeds of others.

I agree that children at the time are not to be held responsible, which is why I specified adults. 

And sure, there might have been a couple of thousands that were against it. But the myth is that Germany and Nazi Germany is somehow two different entities and that the population was never behind what was done in the name of their nation. 

&gt; Germany as a entity and nation was fully and completely responsible. Not all its inhabitants/civilians. Many, many where. Especially those serving in any army, be it wehrmacht or SS. But many millions of Germans also werent. And many 100.000s of Germans were killed directly by the nazis, or indirectly trough allies bombings and raping and killing Soviets.

There were not millions of Germans in opposition to the Nazi.",,/r/europe/comments/gahkab/on_30th_april_1945_75_years_ago_on_this_day_adolf/fp20o35/,BalleBalleBengBong,1588252617

Sorry man but you are a typical uneducated Westerner who is subject to typical Western-propaganda, antisovetism and Russophobia. A simple test for you - answer whom Crimea belongs to ?

All of post-civil war history of USSR is the modernization to prepare country for continuation of WW1. Higher management of Soviets understood war against Germany is imminent (and it was the good option, the bad option would be war agasint intervention of whole West) and tried to modernized country to stand against European Union v1.0.

Assault on 22 June 1941 wasn't total surprise, mobilisation of Red Army had already began prior to 22.  Anyway, measures weren't sufficient and it is clearly a fault of Stalin and higher management of USSR and army. On other hand, USSR spend only about 10 years for modernization: civil war ended just in 1922. USSR could not match army of  the most advanced European nation supported by half of Europe.

2514,"&gt;italy is less civilized than northen europe regions.

Depends on your definition of ""civilization"", I presume.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;for example: gay rights ! you cannot even keep pace with germany...

Gay people, just like all other people, enjoy all the rights guaranteed to citizens by the Constitution.  


&gt;then germany surprised everyone and gave what other northern countries already had... and italy is left behind, civilization my ass.

I have no idea what your point is.

Italy recognizes [civil unions](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unione_civile_(ordinamento_civile_italiano)), which gives same-sex life partners key rights -- financially, in case of sickness, bereavement, etc.  
They're a great thing.  
I wouldn't want to live in a country where my life partner can't take care of me if I get sick.

Yet, this is not considered marriage, which is okay, since it's... a different thing.

In Italy, ""marriage"" is roughly defined, culturally, as that thing that a man and woman enter, then they fuck, have kids and these kids will have a parent of each sex, barring death, illness and tragedy.

Which in my view (and in the majority of Italian's) does certainly not make Italy a *less* civilized country than the fucking Netherlands.

And from what I saw their terror bombings against civilians were in some cases done with only Junkers Ju 87s, which had a bomb carry load of 0,5 to 1,8 tonnes in late war models.

Precisely. They are building those cheap, low quality buses in our country, because EU countries don't wan't to import them from outside single market. They'll probably even win a few lowest-bidder tenders.

&gt;Let's not compare Solaris (that I've literally never heard of) to MAZ -

&gt;lol, another person that doesn't understand the meaning of the term ""occupation""

The legal Polish government remained in exile in UK, and was not allowed to return to the country until 1990. In the meanwhile, a quisling government brought in 1944 from Moscow was ruling the country. Soviet troops were stationing all over the country for 40 years, ready to intervene in cause the position of quisling government was to weaken.

Occupation is a correct word to describe the situation of Poland during the cold war.

&gt;was a very high-quality product

Yeah, I'm sure they produced very high quality 1971-like products... in late 80s.

&gt;Musicians throughout the Union fought over the opportunity to get it.

Well, nothing better was available, so obviously they did.

&gt;Again - it's fine. You got subsidised for rabid anti-communism and eventually brought into a place where you'll be subsidised pretty much no matter what you do now

Stop it, I can only get so erect.

&gt;put judicial system under party control, 

Belarus in charge of judical system advice xDDDDD

&gt;and retain their industry.

That industry would have not to be worthless in the first place, for retaining it being a good idea.

&gt;Yes. Because you were subsidised HEAVILY in the 90s. 

And glad we were, because it allowed us to recover from communism quicker.

&gt;Plus you've had a large number of people that went gastarbeitering to America and whatnot, being able to bring back money and build stuff up

Yeah, but they did that in 80s too. And in the 70s. Now they were allowed to bring their money back though.

&gt;Basically you avoided the ""true"" 90s that everyone to the east of you had - trust me on that.

We had ""true 80s"" to make up for that.

Jedwabne pogrom in Jedwabne, carried out by its Polish inhabitants on 10 July 1941.

Lviv pogroms in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine), perpetrated by German security forces and Ukrainian nationalists from 30 June to 2 July 1941, and from 25 to 29 July 1941.

Szczuczyn pogrom in Szczuczyn, carried out by its Polish inhabitants in June 1941.

Tykocin pogrom in Tykocin, perpetrated by personnel of Einsatzgruppe B on August 25, 1941.

Wąsosz pogrom in Wąsosz, carried out by Poles on 5 July 1941.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland

&gt; Some of these German-inspired massacres were carried out with help from, or active participation of Poles themselves: for example, the Jedwabne pogrom, in which between 300 (Institute of National Remembrance's Final Findings[193]) and 1,600 Jews (Jan T.

2755,"From the large forest and mountain regions in the Nordic countries to the sprawling life in the inner cities, there are large differences in how close together people live across the regions in the EU. The social distancing measures imposed across Europe to limit the spread of the coronavirus are particularly critical in regions with high population density, where it is difficult to go outside, go shopping or use public transport without getting close to your fellow citizens.

In contrast, in and around most capitals and other large economic centres, there tends to by a high number of people living within the limited geographical area of the region.

In 2018, the ten NUTS 3 regions with the highest population density were dominated by large capitals and their surrounding areas. In Paris, there were on average 21 044 people living per square kilometre (km2) of the city, by far the highest in the EU. Several of the regions surrounding Paris also made this Top 10 list, including Hauts-de-Seine (9 371 persons per km2), Seine-Saint-Denis (6 979 persons per km2) and Val-de-Marne (5 774 persons per km2). 

The second highest density in the EU was registered in Central Athens (Kentrikos Tomeas Athinon), with 10 436 persons per km2, with South Athens (Notios Tomeas Athinon; 7 498 persons per km2) and Western Athens (Dytikos Tomeas Athinon; 7 114 persons per km2) also making the Top 10. 

The rest of the Top 10 list was made up by the Romanian capital city (Bucureşti; 7 917 persons per km2) in fourth place, the Belgian capital city of Brussels (7 472 persons per km2) in sixth place and the Spanish autonomous city Melilla on the North African coast (6 050 persons per km2) in ninth place.

It should be noted that population density is also dependent on the size of the spatial unit studied. For example, at a very detailed level, the most densely populated square kilometre in the EU lies in the south-western suburbs of Barcelona, within L’Hospitalet de Llobregat (53 119 inhabitants/km² in 2011). It is followed by the 18th arrondissement in Paris, not far from the Basilica of Sacré Cœur (52 218 inhabitants/km²) and Badalona in the north-east suburbs of Barcelona (50 287 inhabitants/km²). 

The large forest regions and barren subarctic regions in Finland and Sweden feature heavily in the list of the ten regions in the EU with the fewest inhabitants per km2 in 2018. 

 Lapland (Lappi), the northernmost region of Finland, only counted 2 inhabitants per km2. Its neighbouring region across the border in Sweden, Norrbottens län, counted 3 inhabitants per km2, just as another Swedish region, Jämtlands län, and the French overseas region Guyane.

Distant history dispassionately displayed draws didactic discourse. ""Objective Hitler"" in 2020 just asks for more troubles than it uplifts higher thoughts. For ever deep thinker who may draw a great theory from hitler's ideology, there are probably 10 people who just think jews are the problem, and are trying to remember WHY. and extra nuance to hitler may just give them the answer.

2789,"Your worst case scenario involves some, to put it mildly, significant exaggerations (like the claims of mass starvation in Romania or technological backwardness in Bulgaria). But your ""best case"" scenario would involve tens of millions of civilian deaths in occupied areas in Eastern Europe. The Germans caused the deaths of about 20% of the population in the occupied regions of the Soviet Union. Projecting this to the whole of the European USSR for three more years and they could easily triple the historical death count. And the Nazis having three more years in occupied Poland and Yugoslavia could easily lead to more civilian deaths than your estimate in each of them. The rest of your scenario is impossibly optimistic as well. Without the need to focus on fighting the Soviet army and all the resources of the Soviet Union, Germany will be much stronger in the west. They would be able to shift their industry towards the production of submarines and aircraft which would make any invasion of Europe a suicide and likely drive out the Allies out of the Middle East. No country would be any in hurry to quit the Axis, in fact other countries will join them, starting with Turkey. In the end it would like take far more atomic bombs than were necessary in Japan to compel the surrender of Germany and they would be used in Western Europe, which would also be devastated by regular bombing. And once the war ended, with no Soviet Union to serve as  adversary, the US would have no interest in rebuilding Europe.

From outside of Belarus - there was one ""little"" electronics company in Riga called ""Radiotehnika"". They used to build a huge number of awesome speakers, microphones, and all matter of other high-tech acoustic equipment, 35% of all production within the entirety of USSR - it was the highest quality and *extremely* hardy (I still have some speakers from them). Getting your hands on that equipment was damn-near impossible back in the Soviet times - everyone wanted them and they could only produce so much. Long story short - the company is dead. The abandoned high-tech factory floor was demolished in the beginning of 2018.

Yeah, it's all well and good to live off German subsidies and workers' transfers from Britain and Ireland like you and my former compatriots up north do. But in these few odd cases where Germans for some reason aren't willing to give away billions - for example to us - it's nice to keep some of that disgusting, evil, communist industry going.

This trade also effects certain regions like northern ireland more than the rest of the u.k wich could lead to major regional crises especially in northern Ireland. Despite this this is the area where Ireland is at a disadvantage.

However ireland also is vital for many strategic interests in the u.k wich make up for this. For example without Ireland the u.k doesnt have food security wich is vital in world with climate change and more diseases developing in not only humans but also animals. The second largest airline in the u.k with a rough 25% market share is irish while the other u.k airlines lease large amounts of aircrafts from Ireland and irish airspace is vital for transatlantic flights and the British airforce. U.k also imports large amounts of pharmaceuticals from Ireland. Also while no longer the case back in 2008 had the irish government let the banks go bust it likely would of braught down the u.k banks also.

Ireland is obviously reliant on the u.k in many sectors but so is the u.k on many irish sectors as a result both need each other as much as the other.

Well, if you loved the earlier mask a little more than it deserved maybe you’re also hating the newer mask more than it deserves.

See, this is the kind of cynicism that is so aggrevating. Because I have been involved with the US for a long time and follow the american domestic discourse for 20 years now.  And you see, there is a very interesting observation. 

Most americans used to believe their own propaganda just as the rest of the world did. They were convinced to be the good guys. Those infos I am talking about europeans became more aware of...the same happend in the US itself. The result, you would think, is americans getting a shock, put out their torches and pitchforks and demand politics to change course. 

What happend instead? You happend. ""We were always that bad. You poor naive souls. The problem is your idealism and trust.""

Instead of fighting what you found out in the US, you guys embraced it. The convinient way out. All it requires is doing ""nothing"", I mean, what more can you ask for?

The price you pay for that is this distrust and animosity. 

And for the records, I do not think Germany is that much better. But right now I speak as a naive and idealistic person who actually believes in human rights, the rule of law and good governance and saw all that in the US.

3250,"&gt;In view of the various expensive measures the EU has taken recently I find your argument not convincing.

I'm not sure what you're referring to in particular but these are all loans. 'Expensive' implies the EU is footing the bill. The measures you're referring would be payed back with interest.

&gt;So this is not a matter of some political reasons in Northern EU countries, it is a matter of democracy.

That's absolutely fine if you're content to suffer intense economic hardship as a point of principle. I think nobody foresaw what a shitshow the EMU would be and if offered the chance every single state would walk it back. The question is: now that it's turned into a doomsday device, and that 'solidarity' seems to have been a meaningless concept, what choices should rational, self-interested citizens on both sides make?

&gt;There has never been a majority among Northern EU taxpayers that would want to pay for Italian mismanagement in the 1980s and 1990s.

We're in agreement. Hence no side can budge politically. Hence Eurozone collapse. Some other points:

1. Let's be honest: the mismanagement was the entire concept of the EMU. Monetary union can't work in absence of a fical union. The Euro should never have gone ahead if the Dutch / Germans felt so strongly about any risk sharing. Prior to the Euro, Italian per capita GDP was growing in line with Germany's. The largest Italian / Spanish / Portuguese mistakes by far involved strapping themselves to a an economic doomsday device in the illusion there would be some sort of political integration.
2. In absence of the EMU I doubt you'd have called the south mismanaged. Spain and Ireland had low debts and low deficits uptil the GFC. Italy obeyed the fiscal compact from 1970 until 2007. After the EMU, Germany mismanaged its economy appallingly with the Hartz reforms and suffered 1.6% yearly real wage drops through the 2000s (according to Oxfam). And running a huge surplus that's left it in the current low interest / minimal growth export trap, refusing to restructure and watching as its debtors inevitably default, deeply harming German exports, will turn out to have been good management.
3. Obviously Germany is under no obligation to mutualise its debt: that's democracy. A person living in a democracy should want to be careful to avoid needlessly self-harming decisions, but to an Italian it looks like being asked to undergo a Greece-style depression either way. Yet democracy also meansif pushed Italy can drag the Eurozone down on its way out. Germany and Holland might consider that in a democracy one can always one's mind as one's interests become clear.
4. If Italy thinks it has more interest in redenominating and boosting its exports by issuing a devalued Lira, the damage to German trade is expected to be 8% of GDP. That's a decade of growth out the window. It will have born all the social costs of Hartz and seen almost no benefit for its trouble.
5. If you were Italian and had watched Greece be pastoralised by Schauble in 2008-2015, would you risk Scholtz/Reetz inflicting a similar fate by accepting the terms of their loans? I'd insist on keeping them out of my fiscal policy and public services even at the cost of redenomination, crashing the entire Eurozone, taking a large hit to my own output and the hit to German manufacturing. If you're going to be forced into a depression either way, you at minimum end up with a central bank.",,/r/europe/comments/g4zpx2/solidarity_is_not_what_europe_needs_by_yanis/fozc5sa/,aa1607,1588188194

3252,"&gt; Because you jumped to a conclusion as to what my statement actually says. I said the dissolution of the UK, not the creation of a United Ireland.

One would necessitate the other, at least referring to the UK in it's current state. That dissolution would then be compounded by Scotland's prolonged desire to leave as well.

&gt; The Ulster plantations, pretty much anything in Ireland after 1707? Great Famine, The Troubles, Easter Rising, Bloody Sunday, War of Independence? Scotland played its part in those. You can't be foolish to think that was all England right?

You can't honestly be sat here using that defense to me. They're less than a tenth of your size. Half some integrity. Yes, Scottish people were just as present in the plantation of Ulster as the English if not more so. They were not the driving force behind the British Empire, nor the United Kingdom, anymore than Belarus was the driving force behind the USSR.

I would consider the mass murder of civilians in Poland, Ukraine, Germany, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland again, the Soviet Union itself, China the rape of anything that moved between berlin and moscow and others I'm sure I'm missing. 

&gt;And the fact that the whole Western world silently watched and even pushed Germany to war in the east

The Soviet Union literally allied with Germany and actively assisted their rise to power, not only with the annexation of Poland, shipments of vast amounts of raw materials that directly fuelled the German war machine, but the USSR also actively helped with the development of the Wehrmacht's Panzer divisions by allowing them to train in the Soviet Union when ""the west"" was enforcing the ban on German tank training instituted at the end of WW1. The active help of the Soviet Union is more to blame for the rise of Hitler than the passive response of the west.

Likewise, 32 percent consider Russia a friendly country, up from 15 percent, while only 17 percent consider the United States a friendly country, down from 29 percent a year ago. Even more shockingly, **45 percent of Italians surveyed now consider Germany a “hostile country,” 38 percent consider France an enemy**, and 17 percent see the U.K. that way.

3279,"It was a partnership, rather than political support.

This organization, led by a boomer cult leader called Fethullah Gülen (who lives in US since 1999) has been active since 40 years and had relationships with every major clique and fraction in Turkey since then. But their major point was inflitrating everyting in Turkey, mainly the government, the armed forces, the legal system, the business world etc.

They eventually gained some power until 2002, when Erdoğan took over. But between 2002-2013, they had reached their prime thanks to Erdoğan.

Erdoğan and Gülen supported each other because they had   similar ideology and profits. And both of them increased their power and fame getting help from each other. Erdoğan even made an constitutional referendum in order to make Gülenists sneak easier to jurisdiction.

But both sides were so greedy that it was certain that they would become enemies. And it happened. Erdoğan ceased the activities of private teaching instutions called ""dershane""s, which were major sources of income and manpower for Gülen. In response, Gülen's men in police and jurisdiction started legal investigation against Pro-Erdogan businessmen, politicians and even Erdoğan's son.

However, they started to decline from power during this time period, and as a last resort; attempted to take over the country with their men on the Military on 15th July 2016, but ultimately failed. Most of their men went either on jail, escaped from the country or went undercover during this time period.

And the ruling party, AKP still has lots of Gülenists who either went undercover or still has symphaty for them. So, if  Erdogan goes down and AKP still survives, it is very likely for them to get back on their prime time, or at least they'll try.",,/r/europe/comments/gaanzp/turkey_classed_as_authoritarian_country_in_german/fozcopq/,Cruleonard,1588188446

It doesn't matter to the dead, but it does to the living, some motives are worse than others practically. If you target rich, criminals, teachers, cheaters, at least people can avoid being targets by making a choice. Nihilistic and unempathic, but it's true. 

And in some cases, while not proportional at all, it can at least be reasonably motivated, I doubt anyone would weep if someone was targeting child molestor's or other murderers. 

You can't, however, change your ethnicity/age/sexual orientation etc, so you have no chance avoiding being target, and there's no reasonable motivation to it.

Almost all the rights we have are granted by fucking World War treaties you are bound by, they don't come from the goodness of your heart.

If you want to look at the reality without the treaties look at the Csángó people, who still couldn't rebuild their education system, most of them have to learn Hungarian as a past time activity after school and the majority of them are too afraid to even declare their nationality in your censuses. They couldn't even hold masses in Hungarian because the Orthodox church forbade it. They made an exception very recently where they can have a Hungarian mass once per month yay only took 300 years.

3404,"&gt; In the wild as in irl? or in reddit? EU for instance uses * when addressing Kosovo, so does the CoE in it's documents etc. 

Nah, I meant on reddit, hence the ""I highly doubt it's going to be an issue for us mods, unless users throw it out to stirr shit.""

&gt;But if someone posts a picture of lets say Prizren, and posts Prizren, Kosovo* due to a Serbian church being there, would that be inflammtory or with inflammatory intent? The user may simply not want to offend either Serbs or Albanians

*In general*, to me personally, that sounds totally fine. 

With that being said, if there's suddenly an odd amount of quick upvotes and the thread is filled with users making very, very sure to throw ""Kosovo\*"" around as much as they can our approach might be different - but that's pretty much the same as for any other topic.

&gt;indeed about the rightfully one, that would be problematic, but what for instance, if someone writes Pristina,Kosovo and Metohija (as is written into our Constitution), would that be offensive or would that be a non-issue? 

Tougher one. Without diving deeper into it (if there's one thing I learned about the Balkans while moderating here it's that when in doubt the background is a gigantic mess) I'd say that'd also violate our rules since it's just ""Pristina, Serbia"" in different words. Add to that how [wikipedia phrases it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Province_of_Kosovo_and_Metohija) and I'd say that's a closed case: 

&gt;In February 2008, the Republic of Kosovo declared independence.[9][10] While Serbia has not recognised Kosovo's independence, in the Brussels agreement of 2013, it abolished all its institutions in the Autonomous Province.

The issue with all of this is, as you probably know yourself from those threads, that the second users smell what looks like a loophole it's highly likely it's going to be abused just to take a stab at other users. Sucks a bit for someone trying to navigate that minefield because we can rarely give very clear lines, but I don't think we as a team have a better choice.

&gt;Edit: After reading your replies and re-reading the thread, it seems the mods replying in that thread were being very inflammatory to everyone, if it was explained like you explained it to me it would be less dramatic

Let's just say that something like that sometimes is related to the amount of (death-)threats you end up getting on here when writing in green for a topic like this. Yes, that obviously should never be an excuse but in the end we're all still volunteers and (mostly) human.

In the end we expected (rightful) backlash over the actual announcement, but since it's aimed to be a temporary measure until we can find a proper solution to all the shitslinging with ""OTD""-posts (suggestions welcome) we didn't think it'd be a huge deal. 

What we *didn't* (foolishly) expect was a vocal minority seeing this announcement as some kind of pro-/anti-their-favorite-Balkan-country-policy.

In the future for an announcement like this we'll probably end up using a neutral account. An announcement like this always represents the stance of the team as a whole and not that of the individual mod who ends up posting it (not necessarily true for comments) but *usually* we don't have to be so precise about that.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/g9jpza/member_states_of_the_council_of_europe/foyiwhs/,rEvolutionTU,1588173343

&gt; How does 8% of people being uninsured hamper my quality of life?

I don't care about your life. We are talking about the life of all citizens in average, so if 8% are uninsured they have a shitty life compared to the European 8% which are insured.

The government didn't do anything for you, you had to yourself. Why are you defending them now, instead of hoping to improve the situation for people that are going through what you went through. Or do you want them to suffer like you did? 

&gt; The point is, Europe can be better for certain people, but it is mainly the poor.

It would also be better for the black people in the US, but we do not count them, right?

&gt; Because of our policies, we have the largest economy in the world with a lower unemployment rate than most European countries.

That is true, but irrelevant to our discussion. You don't seem to get any benefits of that, except for bragging about it now. Or did the richest economy on the planet cared for you while you were suicidal after all?

but you suffer much more from it as well.

For example, what if I tell you that in Europe people burned 100 tons per year. You will probably say that this is horror, but when you find out that this is the Middle Ages you will not be very surprised.

In the 20th century, from 1920 to 1938, the USSR was a very weak country, inside there were many separatists, bandits and groupings. The war with Poland, Finland. By the way, each has its own complex causes and consequences, and it is impossible to say unequivocally who is right and who is not.

For example, the first war with Poland, the USSR lost, and Poland launched a genocide, shot prisoners and killed many people. Therefore, only then, the USSR, along with Germany, calmly recaptured Lviv and acted equally equitably.

With Finland. At that time, the Nazis were in power by the Nazis in power, supported by Germany. Which staged the genocide of Russians on their territory and regularly carried out attacks on the border, while the USSR proposed pushing the borders away from Leningrad in exchange for other terriories. Do you know why? Because they were afraid that in the event of war the Finns would shell Leningrad. I think you have enough brains to read about the siege of Leningrad, and you will see that fears were not in vain, the Finns helped the Germans in the siege of Leningrad. Now look at how many people died in Leningrad. More than half a million people died of starvation.

Therefore, yes, I think the eviction of national groups that are capable of doing this was normal. Instead of eviction, the Germans created camps and destroyed the population, I think you can also google how many were killed in the Russian camps.

You know, to accuse Russia of genocide, it must be a complete asshole, we have tens of millions of people killed, and you have not mourned these losses for a day, but now mourn a couple of thousand who participated in the Russian genocide.",Moscow (Russia),/r/europe/comments/ga4wle/peoples_of_the_soviet_union/foyjt0t/,maxmydoc,1588173806

Ive been on this since i started highschool so its hard to convey the context and reasoning i have from years of development in this field efficiently without it sounding gibberish. But if i could give you my political memory as context it would be alot esier to get my point accross. I'll put it as simply and bluntly as i can from the beginning without the gibberish, my stance. I dont like the eu in its current form. I think its overbearing too centralized withiut any accountability. You dont have any say who rules the EU. The people who actually call the shots at the very top arent elected by the people, theyre elected by beurocrats, they can make a huge screw up and the people have no way of removing them. They will rule for life or untill they resign or get removed by the eurocrats which wont happen because the eurocrats are always on the leaders side. The european union doesnt have any differing ideas, its a huge echo chamber, the vast majority of the eu is hellbent on mass migration and turning the eu into some kind of united states of europe with their european army and euro currency. The eu will bully member states that dont comply with 100 % of their motives, i dont like that. Even before orban and poland did their arguably ""autocratic"" moves to control the courts, they were refusing immigrants and this was 2015 and the eu was talking abiut sanctions, poland and hungary already had refugees from ukraine and couldnt and wouldnt take any more for valid security reasons, the eu is hellbent of puting national security at risk to be righteous. Which caused hundreds of europeans to lose their lives to terrorists who came in with the refugees. Poland and hungary havnt had any terro attacks in the decade this crisis has been going on because they didnt take any. They have reasons not to take any. But the eu still tried to sanction them back in 2015. Not only this but the vast majority of these refugees are fighting age men. They should be home trying to fix their countries. Not living off of tax payers money. I dont like that. Point being i dont like central authority. Yes im nationalist but im not white supremacist, i just think hungarians should be put first in hungary, polish in poland etc. Hell theres even the news of the coverup of refugee rape gangs in the uk that the police covered up for fears of race relations break down, and they were doing this under the eu. The eu is doing all this shit which is bad for europe, its destroyed itallys economy and made greeces worse than it already is. Its cased mass demographic change which has increased poverty and inequality. You want to see what happens when you force people to live together who are different to each other in religion and culture, you get yugoslavia, kosovo. Bad shit happens.

&gt;It will take a long time for that to happen and we lose skills in the meanwhile, as well as an opportunity to keep worker movement and tourism flowing.

Worker movement is great for undercutting local wages, we should reduce that anyway. If you want to work here, migrate to here.

Second, you are going about this with the idea that communism and nazism are equal. They are not even close. One was a murderous ideology from its infancy, the other was twisted by the Leaders, that implemented it. Third, the Russian empire had a civil war, which resulted in the power grab by the Bolsheviks. It was not something that was supported by all the peoples in the empire. On the other hand, the antisemitic and antislavic sentiment among germans during those times was pretty much universal. Even the people which didn't outright support the nazis had nothing against their policies against jews and their veiws of slavs. They didn't care about the disappearance of their neighbours. They shared the same hatred and would have celebrated the great german victory, if the war ended in a different way. 

The only innnocent people in Nazi Germany were the kids, but unfortunately during wars children suffer for the crimes of their parents- the people that are to be blamed for that.

Moreover, it effectively erased the legal distinction between war and peace because the signatories began to wage wars without declaring them.[7]

I don't like to differentiate between mass murderers, whether you killed 1 million or 10 million people that's still an incomprehensible amount of human suffering and ""ranking"" it is pointless and one could even say disrespectful. 

So morally I think it's perfectly fair to compare USSR in its heyday under Stalin to Nazi Germany. 

Statistically yes the Nazis would've ended up with the bigger body count if they won, because of their insane racial theories, but Stalin was no slouch when it came to mass murder.

“Were enjoying the life and honestly loved him.” Oh, you fucking idiot. People were starving, their loved ones and themselves were in danger if they showed any hate for the regime. People were shot, because they had Estonian books in their home or the Estonian flag. The just fucking pretended to love Stalin just so to survive. 
20 million is impossible? Gulags killed officially 2.7million, but for about 10 years there aren’t any records. For example my greatgrandfather went “missing”. A lot of famous Estonians went “missing” in fact. Or “died of natural causes”. This was the case in all the soviet countries. People were starved all over the union (especially ukraine). Up to 7 million died of starvation (officially). A million of people, who posed a threat to the soviet union (politicians, authors, academics) were taken into prison and died there. There were so many “deaths from natural causes”. Historians all agree, that the number is much higher than the official report, just nobody can agree on the definite amount, because there aren’t proper records. Some say 10 million, some 20, others go up to 50 million people. You have to consider that Soviet Union was a murder machine for years and years. Many more years than Nazi Germany. While Nazis may have killed more people in a small amount of time, Soviet Union killed more overall. And affected many more people.
You say that a lot of people lived happy lives in Soviet Union, but the same could be said about Nazi Germany then.. nazis mainly targeted jews. Those who were not jews (or black or gay) could live a perfectly good life. In Soviet Union in that sense everybody, who wasn’t part of the communist party, was living a shitty life. My other grandfather was pretty well off, but they had to hide the fact, that they were doing okay, because there were several cases of people being killed or deported, because somebody said that they were rich or some other shit.

Drosten: Recovered Corona-Patients are immune

[Picture of Dr. Drosten](https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21746360-1588098910000/16-9/750/Drosten.jpg)

Sub-title: Virologist Christian Drosten is warning that a Immunity-Pass will bring social stigmatization.

**The WHO is warning Countries to assume that Patients who recovered from COVID-19 will be immune against the disease and cannot be infected again. Dr. Drosten doesn't share this presumption, and thinks that there are other reasons why the WHO gave this statement.**

Are you immune or not after you have recovered from COVID-19? A [recent Warning](https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/WHO-warnt-vor-Corona-Trugschluss-article21739769.html) from the WHO seems to give that impression. As they have published, there is no indication that a recovered patient is immune to further re-infections from the same virus. The Virologist Dr. Drosten disagrees with this - in a recent [Podcast](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/podcast4684.html), he stated that he still believes that there is an immunity, and that the statement from the WHO has to be interpreted differently.

[Figure of the Rate of Infections in Germany](https://imgur.com/tYQX3Nw)

Dr. Drosten continues: ""The Immunity after a recovery from COVID-19 may diminish after 2 years, of even a bit longer."" In some few cases, there has been a decrease in antibodies after just 2 months. But "" the antibodies are just a indication of immunity.""

""Antibodies are not the only factor in immunity. They are just an indicator of a recovered infection."" An antibody test does not prove immunity, only that the patient recovered from the disease. Without a ""technical clean test"", the probability of false tests are high.

**Immunity is diminishing**

After you have pulled through the infection, you are not necessarily immune against another reinfection, after a certain time, maybe 2 to 3 years, you can get infected by the same virus again. He refers to the Coronavirus that is responsible for the seasonal cold as an example, and thinks that the new SARS-Corona 2 won't be different.

He adds that a once very dangerous virus might not be as dangerous if you get infected by it a second time, instead of an Infection/Inflammation of the respiratory system, you just end up with a cold. A patient that gets infected a second also is not as infectious, since they do not spread as much of the virus, since the body is inhibiting the production of new virus.

**Wrong Test-Results possible**

Drosten believes that the WHO is not questioning the immunity. He is inferring that their recommendations are rather superflicious, they cannot go too much into detail. The WHO is only able to decide which general direction is appropriate. He further adds, that since it is such a short message, it doesn't convey the reasoning behind it.

[Corona - General Outline in Germany](https://i.imgur.com/C7ehIhw.png) (Cases: 1 per 1000.000 Citizen)

Drosten is thinks that one of the reasons is the possibility of wrong test results. It is possible that patients may have gotten a wrong test result, and are not immune - and then may get infected because they stopped following the safety precautions.

Also, there are the social issues a clean bill of health can bring with it, the WHO also issued a statement regarding the proposal of governments to issue an Immunity-Passport to a person with a positive antibody test.

**Social Anxiety is a menace to Society**

Dr. Drosten warns against the possibility of a Job Offer that requires the applicant to have a Immunity-Passport, since this would lead to people that are not immune becoming outcasts. Or that Health Insurance offers cheaper tariffs to immune people, because the treatment of COVID-19 is expensive.

It could also apply to private events, for example, you only will get invited to a birthday party if you are immune, and many other scenarious. Dr. Drosten thinks this will tear the fabric of society apart, and that this has to be prevented. That's why, in his opinion, the WHO issued their statement.

3724,"Don't even give that bullshit credence by talking as if ""herd immunity"" is even capable of being a strategy.

The way that both the UK and EU media, with many people following, latched onto that standard scientific expression and tried to twist its meaning to something horrible really demonstrated the level of scientific ignorance that is prevalent even today.  

The UK government presented the standard flatten the curve model and mentioned the words ""herd immunity"", and the next day people were talking as if the UK's strategy was something called ""herd immunity"" and that entailed doing nothing until everyone either died or became immune.

While retrospectively we will probably see that the UK's initial approach was overly optimistic (while acknowledging that at the time there was a problem with panic buying and a high risk of civil disorder), amazingly the UK's strategy was never ""do nothing"", as much of some of the current government's detractors would like people to believe that, which is what the term ""herd immunity"" has come to mean in the minds of many gullible fools.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/g9ulqn/why_boris_johnson_isnt_getting_the_blame_for/foxpri9/,kingofeggsandwiches,1588151971

3857,"""Normally Nithing pole should conclude a horse’s head instead of a sheep’s head..so this was probably meant to be symbolic""

As opposed to ""real"" magic, which never would dream of using symbols to achieve an end...

Oh movies, what you've done to us...

I am curious though if there is a deeper symbolism intended by using sheep, as horses in Norse myth tend to be a symbol of wildness, while sheep are just about as much a polar opposite to that idea as you can find.  It's entirely possible they were used out of convenience, but it seems entirely possible that their use here may connote the power of domestic civility being turned on the Alþingi who are the ones acting in a perhaps less honorable manner.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Incidentally, that wikipedia article you linked has an instance mentioned of another historical níðstöng that used a human head, rather than a horse's head.

&gt;The Icelandic Vatnsdæla saga records that when Finbogi failed to show up for a hólmganga (duel), Jökul raised a nithing pole against Finbogi for his cowardice by carving out a human head which was placed on a post with magic runes, killing a mare, and then placing the post into the mare's breast with the head facing towards Finbogi's dwelling.",,/r/europe/comments/fux7e7/a_níðstöng_nithing_pole_raised_against_the/foxj13t/,cykros,1588145521

I can point that out and also point out America wastes far too much on stupid foreign wars.  See how that works?

After only a couple of weeks of being painted as the ""bad guy"" of the EU, you had Dutch coming out of the woodwork all pissed off, actimg arrogant, attacking anyone that oppoaed them, and complaining of being made to look like the villian.  You Europeans just have no clue what its like to hold the type of responsibility the US does, and when you get small tastes, you usually react worse than the US.   And it is the utter arrogance and lack of self-reflection that makes it insufferable.  I see way more Europeans being arrogant than Americans. And if were being real with each other, I think iit is because Europeans havent admitted they have lost significant influence and power on the world stage.  I think it just pisses you off to no end the uncultured Americans dominated the prior zones of European control.  I dont hate Europeans, many are great people, but some need an ego check very badly.

Corporations that pulled it off to barely pay taxes (or none at all) but are still allowed to access all of the public infrastructure (for which they didnt contribute shit). 


Corporations that - despite all this - walk around and threaten public with them moving HQ if they are not allowed to exploit workers and pollute the environment.


Yes, they appear very powerful. Until their narrative of strenght gets ripped apart and the naked reality gets visible. 


And what do we see then? We see that their power relies on us believing that they are untouchable. If we start to change that, they are fucked. And they know this.


Because the (bigger) corporations and the public are in a relationship. And it is a brutally abusive one. The public gets beaten up, gaslighted and told to be happy about it. Otherwise they will be left alone. And who would want that.


Well, actually quite many people want to. And actually the public is - by far - strong enough to do this. Corporations can beat their chest about moving HQ all they want - in the end they are just a bodybuilder full of steroids with no real muscle. 


Why? Because they need to make money by selling their products. And none is going to buy these in their sweet carribean tax withholding retreats. Most of the money they want to get sits in us-american or european hands, when it comes to the western sphere. 



And of the US or the EU should decide to simply block those corporations from accessing their markets, these abusive fuckers are fucked. They can move their HQ as much as they want. The chinese market can't make up for that loss. In the meantime their services and products will be substituted by other law abiding companies in a matter of time and that is it.

The bigger issue is can any country afford a trade war with anyone now?

The fact is, the Eastern states are in the EU for the nice economic benefits it brings, they have absolutely no interest in Western ""liberal"" ideas.

4030,"Fitch has downgraded Italy’s credit rating to a single notch above “junk”, saying the jump in debt levels resulting from the coronavirus crisis will increase doubts about the sustainability of Rome’s borrowings.

In an unscheduled update on Italy’s creditworthiness, the rating agency said it expects the country’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product to rise by around 20 percentage points this year to 156 per cent, as a surge in spending combines with an 8 per cent contraction in the economy. 
“The downgrade reflects the significant impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic on Italy's economy and the sovereign's fiscal position,” Fitch said in a statement on Tuesday evening as it moved the country’s rating to BBB-. 

“According to our baseline debt dynamics scenario, the [debt] to GDP ratio will only stabilise at this very high level over the medium term, underlining debt sustainability risks.”
The Italian government provided additional information that resulted in a decision that was “different than the original rating committee outcome”, Fitch said, adding that the current crisis had caused it to bring forward its scheduled rating review from July.

Roberto Gualtieri, Italian finance minister, responded to Fitch’s decision by saying that “the fundamentals of Italy's economy and public finances are solid”. 

In a statement reported by Italian newswire Ansa, Mr Gualtieri said the decision did not take into account decisions taken by the EU, its member states or its institutions. “In particular, the strategic orientation of the European Central Bank does not seem to be adequately valued,” he added. 

The downgrade comes just days after Italy’s reprieve by Standard &amp; Poor’s on Friday, which held its rating at BBB. Fitch joins Moody’s in rating Italian debt at a single notch above junk. Italy would see its bonds thrown out of widely followed indices if two of the three agencies were to strip it of its coveted investment-grade status, forcing some investors to offload the country’s debt.
Italian bonds, which have rallied since the S&amp;P announcement, could now come under further selling pressure. 

Italy’s 10-year yield ended Tuesday at 1.72 per cent, down from a one-month high of more than 2.2 per cent last week. Despite the decline, Rome’s borrowing costs remain well above levels seen at the start of the year as investors worry about a deluge of new debt issuance to fund its response to the pandemic, and the reluctance of other eurozone members to share the financial burden of fighting the crisis.

The ECB has helped to stabilise the sell-off with heavy buying of Italian bonds under its €750bn emergency asset-purchase programme, easing concerns that the eurozone could be headed for a new debt crisis.

Fitch assigned a stable outlook to Italy’s rating, saying the support of the central bank should keep borrowing costs “at very low levels at least over the near term”. 
Even so, the downgrade could add pressure on the ECB to signal further stimulus at its policy meeting on Thursday. 

Fitch said in its statement: “Downward pressure on the rating could resume if the government does not implement a credible economic growth and fiscal strategy that enhances confidence that general government debt/GDP will be placed on a downward path over time.” 
Mike Riddell, a bond fund manager at Allianz Global Investors, said Rome losing its investment-grade credit rating is “a matter of when, not if”. 

“Italy’s debt is probably heading to somewhere upwards of 170 per cent of GDP next year,” he said. “These are the kind of levels where you get junked; it doesn’t matter how much of your bonds the central bank is buying.”",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/ga26g9/fitch_cuts_italys_credit_rating_to_one_notch/fox1gk7/,MelodicBerries,1588131825

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I typed out part of a reply but got distracted, then forgot all about this post. My apologies &amp; no offense would be taken on my part if you've lost the thread of the conversation &amp; don't want to continue. But i'll have a bash anyhow at some of your points.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; I will clarify it to refer to someone who believes that whites have inherently superior characteristics to other ethnic groups. I apologize for anything perceived as an insult, that isn't my intent.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We do have superior characteristics, and also some inferior one. In the IQ charts i mentioned north-east Asians scored higher, in fact North-east Asian immigrants to the US and Europe tend to outperform whites in almost every aspect of life, crime rates, school test score, economic performance, you name it. There are studies that show this to be true even regardless of environmental factors like undernourishment as a child, parents coming from poverty. East Asians just seem to turn out pretty smart.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;While i could see why you maybe wouldn't want to use my preferred term (race realist) given that you reject that reality, can you concede that 'white supremacists' has been a term invented &amp; used by our enemies purely to discredit my beliefs in the eyes of the wider public, &amp; shouldn't be used by anyone interested in good faith discussions?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; But essentially, someone with an IQ of 65 is essentially retarded  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;European with an IQ that low are likely to have some form of condition behind it such as down syndrome. For your average African this is not the case, &amp; thus they can function just fine at a certain civilisational level. Although on that note the US Army did have to lower their IQ threshold and what they considered to be retarded from 80 to 70 primarily in order to conscript black soldiers in any number (also note that 20-25% European admixture) and know that Africans DO struggle to perform many basic jobs, and maintain complex industrial or even agricultural societies, this is a patently observable fact. The only difference is that your side usually puts that down to environmental factors (often it's ascribed to racism, the legacy of slavery or colonialism) when really biology is the true culprit, however since I can't claim to be particularly literate on this matter i'd like to link you to a list of other studies beyond the one you mentioned which you can read at your leisure. (see your PM's)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; We know that individual variation in IQ is higher than variations in IQ between ethnic groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;And? If you're proposing that different groups be able to ix freely then the group averages matter,  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; I don't equivocate personal property to the right of being able to live within the same country. I think there are enough differences here to question the usefulness of the comparison.They are very different true, but you've not explained how we're 'making different groups suffer' by not helping them?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;For full disclosure i DO want to help people, i'm not a capitalist or libertarian (cold blooded lizards that they are). Fascism is all about collaboration for the common good, &amp; nations being able to aid each other is one of the wonders of modernity. However it can't be at the expense of our own people, and inviting them into our lands to exploit their labour by the millions, until we're a resented minority in our own towns &amp; cities doesn't seem like helping them to me, and even if it was the price would be too high. The concept would have been laughed at by people 50 years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;  In economics, it's known as the Lump of Labor fallacy (see relevant Wikipedia). In the US and most other large immigrant nations, we know that immigrants contribute more to the welfare system than they take out. This makes sense because a lot of these immigrants are coming to fulfill job opportunities, and tend to be young if not skilled (the main source of tax income).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It's not a fallacy, it's been proven that immigration depresses wages for the working classes. It's simple supply &amp; demand. I'm not of course arguing that it doesn't grow GDP, the almost religious concept &amp; basis of our capitalist system, worshipped by politicians &amp; economists. I assume i don't have to explain why limitless GDP growth is unsustainable in the long run &amp; destroying our planet?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I'd also suggest that immigration harms unionisation, the heights of the labour movements in Western nations were in the early-mid 20th centuries, when strong homogenous communities of workers could repeatedly use their collective power to force bosses to the table. Almost all of these unions were vehemently opposed to immigration &amp; were often openly racist (as were the communities they drew their ranks from) as of course the didn't want bosses being able to import anyone from across the world to undercut them, which eventually ended up happening, when white working class communites were destroyed &amp; largely jewish leftists subverted the labour movements into focusing on nonsensical concepts such as racial egalitarianism over worker protections.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;One more point, immigrants might be young &amp; working age, when they arrive, but they do grow old, &amp; have children, the studies that want to show immigrants as more productive than the native population seem to conveniently leave out this fact. Also it's dumb to group together the rich ones that pay taxes with the poor ones that don't, just because we take the former doesn't mean it's a good idea to take the latter.But It's not particularly important to me how skilled they are or not anyway, as i've said i'm not a capitalist. I'd be happy with perhaps a tiny number of experts to be allowed in that we simply couldn't train from our local population, preferably on a temporary basis.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; I'm an American with European ancestry. But I have an immigrant roomate and nonwhite family members. Why should I prioritize Europeans whom I have never met, and indeed, some of whom probably resent me over my own family and friends?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't ask you to prioritise Europeans that you never met, you should prioritise your fellow Americans, that are being screwed over by mass immigration. As a country you were 90% white up until very recent history, I propose that your country functioned better then &amp; you should try to return to your roots, but if you want to accept the situation as it is &amp; try and make it work as a multi-racial society i would understand. I, personally, could never accept it as a Scot/Brit/European whose ancestors have lived &amp; died on this island for thousands of years, but i get that America is in a different situation. You have to be pragmatic. Either way, mass immigration needs to end or your situation will continue to get worse, and anti-white discrimination needs to end. Look to pre-war Syria to see how different communities or religions and ethnicities were able to live together in relative harmony. Transgressions between communities were NOT tolerated, and the dominant sunni Arab group were heavily appeased, i.e the president had to be muslim, Assad married a Sunni &amp; didn't openly practice his Alewite beliefs.

&gt;I am still curious if you think the National Socialist German Workers' party was socialist or not.

National socialism is fundamentally anti-Marxist, and although socialism has been a name for a variety of movements - and the Nazis themselves clearly thought of themselves as a new socialist movement - Nazism is diametrically opposed to scientific socialism.

4172,"Celtic are from Glasgow, which was labour as fuck until the 2015 GE came around and the SNP won everything. Glasgow was very working class and still is, and as such has had a large left wing movement, notably Red Clydeside when tanks were deployed against civilians (one legend holds that the Scottish Soldiers in Maryhill barracks were locked in and English soldiers were brought in during one industrial dispute. Although this is probably just an Urban myth).

Celtic were formed by desperate immigrants and refugees from Ireland who lived some of the worse conditions in Western Europe, leading to Refugees Welcome signs everywhere.

Free Market and Laissez Faire Capitalism were some of the key factors to the Famine that led to the Irish fleeing en masse to Glasgow.

Both Irish and Scottish Nationalism are broadly left of centre. (See Sinn Fein, SDLP, SNP, Tommy ‘God bless Neil Francis Lennon’ Sheridan, and the party that brought about devolution and has misfortune as having the exact same demographic as the SNP, Labour)

Catholicism may be very right wing at times but sometimes it can also be left wing (see St Oscar Romero, Liberation Theology came from Catholicism, Preferential Option for the Poor).

Celtic are also great friends with St Pauli and often you can find Che Guevara flags at games. Basque, Catalan, and Palestinian Flags are everywhere. 

During the election the Green Brigade (Celtic Ultras) displayed a banner chastising famous Celtic Fan Rod Stewart for supporting the Tories.

1988 Scottish Cup Final; Thatcher gets booed to fuck by both Celtic and Dundee United fans.

TLDR Celtic are from a working class left wing town, founded by an oppressed minority, who traditionally follow a church that has a tradition of being kind to those in need such as the poor.

4294,"&gt;I understand your frustration. But at least you can vote in the German elections and somewhat influence the government.

Yeah I'm trying. I'm even locally active, which makes it's more depressing. 

&gt;""German bashing"", think of it as directed to those 4 states and conservatives voting for CDU.

It's not as you continue further down. Nobody even some German like to bash without information.


&gt;I want Germany to become carbon neutral as soon as possible, I don't care how it does it. And I will continue to critisize the German decision to not use nuclear power because it doesn't solve the GHG emissions problem, it makes it harder to achieve sustainable levels.

Nuclear is decoupled from that problem. All that coal states I mention no nuclear anywhere near. Immeaditly shutting down nuclear would mean close to nothing in North Germany and South Germany more imports from sourrounding neighbors especially France. 

I pesonally have no problem with nuclear, the waste is a financial and poltical big issue, with doesn't has many solutions in Germany.

But to think nuclear would change anything on our coal output is naive. Building new, even if the population and politics would be totally for it, would be to late massively, if ignore cost which would be much higher. 

The only way out for Germany is build renewable quick again and getting their Power to Gas solution ready, so we don't need to turn of renewables and have a deeper penetration in other energy sectors.


&gt;In the recent years the only reason why Germany managed to lower its GHG emissions was because they started switching from coal to natural gas.

That is wrong again.  We are not even on 2010 and before levels. Due Gas prices and low CO2 prices, the Renewables driving down the prices, killed Gas output a lot in Germany the recent years. Only with the new EU CO2 prices in 2019, Gas got far more profitable. 

I mean from 2018 to 2019 we had 8 TWh increase in Gas and 18 TWh increase in Wind alone. 

https://www.energy-charts.de/energy.htm?source=all-sources&amp;period=annual&amp;year=all


Also if your claim would be right, you should critize the UK and the US a lot. They predomitaly run on Gas.  In Germany Gas had a share of around 10% in 2019, while nuclear still had 13%.


&gt;Just my stance towards it. If Germany lowers its GHG emissions I will stop criticizing the German energy politics, until then I have every right to do it, because until today it hasn't been effective and sustainable at all.

Be my guest to critize them. But do three things for me. Do factual arguements and not hear say from reddit. There are reasonable arguement for the South to keep nuclear. That it would replace lignite/coal isn't one.

Point out the failure, instead of a general critique. Like Germany coal exit is too slow, the carbon tax is still not inplace and not high enough. The building of renewables is currently blockaded mostly form the administration. 


Don't argue about the past, especially long gone past. Yes sadly the FRG didn't build nuclear plants in NRW and sadly the GDR didn't build nuclear plants and saxony and bordering states. 


Also energy politics became much more effective and sustainable. To deny the progress made is weird.

Your first point is entirely besides the point of this discussion, but let's just say I find it interesting to see an attempt by the US to unfuck itself politically. Sadly, it will probably remain a complete shitshow for years to come. Call it schadenfreude if you will.

Calling the trans-atlantic slave trade a ""continuation of global slave trade"" is beyond a retarded take. It's deliberately obfuscating and honestly downright insidious. The slave trade was quite literally among the largest maritime migrations in all of human history. It was entirely unprecedented, as before then, there literally wasn't a ""new world"" to speak of with an almost infinite supply of business opportunities, and accordingly an almost infinite necessity of labour. Admittedly, I did make a mistake. I said the trans-atlantic slave trade was the result of capitalism. It'd be more accurate to say capitalism in fact formed from that cesspool of misery, violence and evil.

It wasn't a ""continuation of a global slave trade that had existed for centuries"". It quite literally couldn't exist without the triangular trade, something that was only introduced after the discovery of the new world. Its scale was immeasurably larger than any transaction of slaves made prior to that point. Moreover, the treatment of the slaves was far more negligent and malicious than most instances of slaves in human history. Please, for god's sake, read a fucking book on a subject before you go spouting nonsense.

But really, this is all besides the point. Your continuous insistence to focus on this ONE point only highlights that you have no argument against the fact that American imperialism is a direct result of its rampant capitalism.

4455,"I agree in a sense that everyone loses in a war and there is, as you point out,  a monument and a special recurrence day dedicated to that. 25th April is the anniversary of something else, it shouldn't even cross people's mind to celebrate the ""other side"" too... 25th April is not a mourning day in the sense of the Milite ignoto's recurrence, it's the Liberation, from the fascists. 

The fact that some parties are willing to overlook that small detail in order to subtly change the meaning of the festivity, that's very wrong imho because it leads to a slippery slope where Italians forget about the horrors of the fascism. It muds the waters, when the waters,  now more than ever,  should stay crystal clear. Have you noticed (as a more generalized trend, not only in Italy) that racism, xenophobia and hate speech doesn't seem *so wrong* anymore? It's being normalized by today's politicians... the racists and bigots you've mentioned,  they don't feel quite ashamed about their backwards world views anymore. It's important to keep the line, but that's just my opinion so perhaps I'm overly sensitive to the idea of mourning dead fascists in the day we celebrate our freedom from their oppressive and deadly regime. 

About working on the past, I think the issue is not how Italians acted towards the end of immediately after the war, altho as you say many people in leading roles (even just important clerks) went on as if nothing happened. I think the ball has been dropped in the last decade or two.  You can't ignore the rise of a more extreme right (the new right, as it's called), in a country where many people still have direct or very close recollection of the war, and pretend everything was fine in how it processed its fascist past.

My grandpa lived and worked as a machinist &amp; train conductor in North-East Italy at the time (now Istria, part of Croatia). He was spared from deportation as his role was considered essential due to his ability in running precious cargo around the local railways and due to his knowledge of the trains he drove. 

Despite this, towards the end of the war all the male citizens of Italian heritage from his Istrian village were rounded up and lined up to be marched to a place where they'd be shipped off to concentration camps.

Among them were my grandpa (whom I never properly met unfortunately, he died when I was just 2) and his cousin. As soon as the marching started, the line walked past a long road with a bend and a ditch by the side. When the officer at the end of the line was behind the bend, my grandpa flung himself into the ditch, risking on-the-spot execution. Luckily, he wasn't seen and just waited in the ditch perfectly still until the whole line had passed him and it got darker. He jumped out of the ditch and ran back to his village by foot.

Yes, I am repeating myself, because I don't think you read that.

The US invested hugely in roads and a comprehensive world-leading freight rail system. I can get in my car right now, and go anywhere in the US at a high speed, in safety and comfort of my car. We also have much lower taxes on cars and fuel than you so. Why the internal decisions of the US as to how to move freight and passengers is of such interest to Europeans like you, I will never, ever understand.

4594,"&gt;Germany may be compelled to bring back elements of its lockdown amid signs that coronavirus cases could be on the point of starting to multiply again.

&gt;The country’s virus reproduction rate, which measures how many people the average person with Covid-19 infects, has rebounded to a value of 1.0, the dividing line between growth and decline, according to government epidemiologists.

&gt;Angela Merkel has said that German hospitals will be overwhelmed by the end of June if the number rises even a little higher, and that a corresponding increase in infections would make a second “shutdown” unavoidable.

&gt;The figure is likely to exacerbate divisions over Germany’s coronavirus strategy as ministers prepare to discuss the next steps at a video conference on Thursday.

&gt;Over the past week the 16 states have begun to reopen shops, schools, zoos and even some churches but there are still strong disagreements over how fast to lift the curbs on society and business. Some senior figures in the chancellor’s centre-right party are pressing for more restrictions to be lifted in short order, arguing that the mounting economic damage is a greater danger than the risk of more infections.

&gt;Yet Mrs Merkel, 65, has dismissed the idea. “We have achieved so much, but we are not out of the woods yet, and we cannot gamble it all away,” she said.

&gt;She has placed the reproduction rate, also known as R0, at the heart of her approach to the pandemic. Any value below 1 means that the number of cases will fall; anything above 1 implies an exponential increase.

&gt;“If we get to a point where each patient is infecting 1.1 people, then by October we will be back at the limits of our health system in terms of intensive-care beds,” Mrs Merkel said. “If we get to 1.2 . . . then we will hit the full capacity of our health system as early as July. And if it’s 1.3, which doesn’t sound like much, we hit the full capacity of our health system in June. So you can see how little room for manoeuvre we have.”

&gt;Two weeks ago, when Germany’s 16 states agreed to partially relax their social distancing rules, the R0 had fallen to 0.7, from a peak of 1.3 in early April.

&gt;Today, however, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the government’s infectious diseases agency, said it had risen back to approximately 1. Lothar Wieler, the president, said it was hard to tell why or when coronavirus carriers had become more likely to pass the disease on.

&gt;It may have something to do with Germans beginning to chafe against the lockdown. Social scientists at Mannheim University have interviewed a panel of more than 500 people each day and found that both their fear of Covid-19 and their compliance with social distancing rules have slipped since mid-April.

&gt;Professor Wieler said the way the R0 had crept up was no great cause for concern on its own, describing the value as “an important figure, but not the only holy grail” of epidemiology. He pointed out that the number of new coronavirus cases reported in Germany had fallen from more than 6,000 a day in early April to less than a third of that number in the past week.

&gt;However, he urged Germans not to take their safety for granted. “We don’t want the number of cases to rise again,” Professor Wieler said. “We don’t want to have to treat more people who are seriously ill with Covid-19 in our country. We don’t want our healthcare system to be overstrained.”

&gt;Markus Söder, chief minister of Bavaria and the man who has overseen the strictest coronavirus measures in Germany, said he was concerned by the latest data. “The new figures on the reproduction rate worry me and they show that Bavarian caution is better than moving so quickly that you trip over yourself,” he said. “We need a strategy like breathing: when things are better, you can go faster. When things get worse, you must proceed more slowly.”

&gt;With Germany lurching towards its worst recession since the Second World War, however, those on the other side of the argument are lobbying hard for a bolder plan to unshackle the economy. Armin Laschet, the chief minister of North Rhine-Westphalia and one of Mr Söder’s strongest rivals for the chancellorship, has assembled a coalition of at least half a dozen states that favour further easing.

&gt;Appearing on Anne Will, a popular television panel show, Mr Laschet said 40 per cent of the intensive-care beds in his state were unoccupied and urged viewers to think of the effect the lockdown was having on children who had been cooped up at home for six weeks.

&gt;The other politicians on his side range from the Green party mayor of Tübingen, Boris Palmer, to the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany party. Yesterday Alexander Gauland, the AfD’s co-founder and joint leader in the Bundestag, appealed to Mrs Merkel to lift the restrictions with immediate effect. “The shutdown is threatening to inflict more harm than the virus itself,” he said.",Swede in the UK,/r/europe/comments/g9rfvw/germany_ready_to_tighten_lockdown_as_coronavirus/fov3cfq/,English-Breakfast,1588094709

&gt;You'll need to give the EU more power.

You seem to think I would have a problem with this, or that I am anti-EU for some reason. I'm not. A federal EU with properly defined power structures sounds like a sensible idea to me, and should be arrived at by consent. It will mean that the West (and North) needs to accept and compromise with the East (and South), though, not just ride roughshod over them because they have more money or because they have some sense of colonial mission (""their opinions don't need to be considered""- seriously??).

&gt;pay off bordering states to ensure that no refugee ships cross the Med  
&gt;  
&gt;Absolutely not, wtf kinda shit is that? You literally want to subsidize authoritarian regimes to keep refugees inside?

We do this already. We should just do it better and properly. There is a concern of allowing those regimes to turn the tap back on but with proper border infrastructure this would cease to be a problem. At which point the agreements can be renegotiated.

&gt;Allow dual citizenship to only be acquired by EU citizens  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a national affair. You'll need the EU to federalize first to get the EU to have a hand in this.

Yes, Germany does it already. Again, fine with the EU federalising, but also fine with member states doing this individually. Main thing is to limit pull factors to the EU by not giving people the false impression that they will be able to enter the EU and stay indefinitely with all the rights of citizens of the EU.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;allow for citizenship to only be passed on by descent  
&gt;  
&gt;No, definitely not. Citizenship doesn't depend on descent and the idea it does goes against modern European values.

Again, Germany had this kind of citizenship until the early naughties, I daresay other states within the EU still have it now, certainly other states in the world do. It's really not particularly radical, certainly no more so than the recent citizenship laws passed by Israel or India.

Increasing birthrates for EU citizens is absolutely relevant for better rates of integration. If we are going to have large numbers of children with a background outside of the host country (which we are) it's important that there are large numbers of host-country born children and parents to integrate and socialise with them in order to integrate the country. 5 kids in a class of 20 can be integrated. 10 kids is harder. 15 kids will lead to ghettoisation. Germany, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary all have policies to try and promote families and to get their birthrates up. Like lots of people, I prefer this than immigration or driving up the birthrate through large immigrant families, which I think is just laying the groundwork for future problems and destabilisation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;None of these proposals is all that outlandish  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of the ones you proposed are unacceptable and go against European values.

Most are \_already being carried out\_ or have been carried out be member states whilst they have been part of the EU. Who are you to define what 'European Values' are? You are happy to ride roughshod over the opinion of at least a good 30% of the electorate (probably closer to 50%), whose views you claim don't need to be considered- that is in my opinion a far worse violation of the European Value of democratic consensus building.

Insofar as my proposals violate the current framework of human rights there are two options- either you get round them, which is currently what the EU and member states choose to do, or you accept that the law is an ass and attempt to rework it to fit modern times. The law is after all, clearly failing to do what it was set out to do, whilst enabling what it was not supposed to enable. I prefer the honesty of the latter approach, and the fact that a British Prime Minister thought it might be up for discussion strongly suggests to me that such a renegotiation would be possible if Germany and France were both prepared to consider it, which is far from impossible given current trends.",,/r/europe/comments/g8xgmg/eu_granted_protection_to_almost_300_000_asylum/fouo7la/,Stralau,1588087601

here are the facts

Part of the report 

""After Nazi gold: Freeports, Fifa, HSBC... and human rights

 A wide range of secrecy-related scandals continues to plague the sector. For example, there has been widespread  concern  that  a  lucrative  freeport  in Geneva, where art and other valuables can be stored without incurring any taxes is increasingly being used for getting around transparency requirements and fostering criminality. This was underlined by news in 2015 that the Geneva businessman behind them had been arrested in Monaco for defrauding 7 Switzerland investors. An investigation in 2014  by  the  French  media group Médiapart reported:

“The Geneva free port is potentially a large laundry machine,” says one connoisseur of these places. “Most of the time, inventory controls are announced in advance by letter and  the  premises  are  not  immediately sealed.  If  you  have  something  to  hide, you can always arrange to store it with a neighbor” he explains. “There is often too much  cosiness  between  warehousemen and customs officials: they lunch together, build friendships \[...\] It seems that some customs officials do not want to hinder trade.” 

 Given the size of the Freeport – in the words of Nicholas Brett, an insurer, talking about the value of artwork held there - **“I doubt you’ve got a piece of paper wide enough to write down all the zeros” – this alone makes Switzerland a jurisdiction of major and ongoing concern for money laundering and tax evasion.

 That's an important difference. 

[Resolutions of the UNGA aren't even binding for member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly):
&gt;Although the resolutions passed by the General Assembly do not have the binding forces over the member nations (apart from budgetary measures), pursuant to its Uniting for Peace resolution of November 1950 (resolution 377 (V)), the Assembly may also take action if the Security Council fails to act, owing to the negative vote of a permanent member, in a case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression.


Analogue for something like Kosovo: Even though the *majority of members* clearly recognize it as an independent nation the *CoE as an organisation* doesn't say they do or they don't.

Moreover at the very least western Europe, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Nordic countries have had some form of 'de-nazification', no matter how limited they may have been, and an argument can be made about Eastern Europe having had some remnants of this from the Soviet-influenced era, but obviously it is a bit more complex in the latter case given the phenomenon of post-Soviet nationalism where suddenly you see support for 'nazism' in the name of a nation who actually fought real Nazism - but I digress.

But then you have countries which view 'Nazism' as something external to them, as something foreign, as a phenomenon only applicable to 'Europe' and not applicable to their own country.

[This is the Mansudae Monument](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Mansudae-Monument-Bow-2014.jpg), two giant copper statues of two murderous tyrannical bastards. Impressive, right? 

Do you think these statues should remain there after their murderous regime eventually falls? 

Because to you those might be ""unique interesting artwork"", but to many of the people living there they're symbols of their oppression. They look at the statues and are reminded of their dead relatives, tortured and murdered in some death camp by this unfathomably cruel regime.

So no, if some guy blows these statues up, because his entire family was carted off to a death camp where they were raped and then thrown into kennels where dogs ate them alive, he's not doing it for """"PROPAGANDA REASONS"""", he's doing it because they're a physical representation of his immeasurable suffering, and it's a tiny, tiny way in which he can get some measure of relief.

4941,"I think you seriously underestimate how widespread scepticism is wrt immigration from Africa and the ME.

There are the hardcore minorities that vote for the nationalist parties (frequently polling majorities in Eastern Europe and significant minorities in Western Europe) but that is just the tip of the iceberg- the people who are so outraged by it that they are prepared to vote for parties that are still not socially acceptable in many circles.

Attitudes on the centre-right are actually pretty similar, they merely balk at some of the radical solutions ascribed to the nationalists. Even attitudes in the centre and hard left (think SPD or Die Linke in Germany) are very conflicted on the issue. The only parties where you will find near universal support for the borderline criminal NGOs and for increased immigration is amongst green parties and the like, and amongst the professional political classes. That is, a shrinking minority, as was evinced by the last European elections.

Loaded survey questions (“Do you think people fleeing war should be sheltered in wealthy countries?”) can still turn up favourable results, but as soon as you put the question more realistically/neutrally (“are you in favour of increased migration from Africa/ME?”, “Immigration from Africa/ME has enriched the country-agree or disagree”, “The government should take a harder line on immigration” etc.) these results vanish.

What I find really disgusting is the ease with which people who buy into the mass immigration is a blessing narrative are prepared to demonise Eastern Europeans, who really _do_ enrich the countries they migrate to (according to an LSE study) and who should represent the great hope for the future of the EU, with their excellent education systems, high growth rates and work ethic.

Switching sides when things go south is a bit of a national sport, and fascism was no exception. So many people were quick to burn their black shirt and change into a red (or white) one as soon as it was clear Mussolini and his regime were done for and so was the country.

Piazzale Loreto wasn't a moment that should be celebrated, not even from the ""dead fascist = good fascist"" standpoint. Defiling a corpse is never justified, much less when it's going to give the few loyal supporters (and their epigons) the chance to claim foul play and to present themselves as victims.

An actual trial and THEN a death sentence would have helped the country to actually put it all behind, by closing a terrible chapter of its history with no ""buts"" or ""ifs"" and no ""well, actually...""

Instead they went for a private kangaroo court that gave nobody actual closure. Conversely, they also decided to forgive many of those who were involved and compromised with fascism, which didn't help matters and they've stuck around and resurfaced later.

It is illegal to fly swastikas or own copies of Mein Kampf in Germany with very limited accepted circumstances outside of Museums; France recognizes its crimes regarding slavery and abuse in Haiti and Indochina; the Uk recognizes its past issues like its involvement in the Slave Trade, which it abolished nearly 200 years ago and made illegal in an international sense, recognized its crimes in India, etc; the USA accepts the crimes it committed against the Natives and mandates educating kids about this topic in schools not to mention the constantly discussed and recognized and apologized for topic of American slavery; Belgium recognized its crimes in the Congo under Leopold II and his Force Publique, which has been public knowledge for over 100 years when he was removed from holding any authority in the colony and the Force Publique was abolished. I could go on, but to make the argument that Western Nations don't recognize their past crimes is almost completely false. I mean no disrespect by this; however, oftentimes Turks may try and point towards the shortcomings of many European countries' pasts to shift the conversation or say they are the victim of Western Imperialism when such ideologies are dead and these countries aren't guilty of covering them up anymore. Really all we want is for Turkey to recognize the genocide as it is rather than trying to take the moral high ground over false information; especially when such a ""high ground"" shouldn't exist in the first place. Everyone has made mistakes in the past, don't try to revise history to match your perspective and act superior, when instead, you can just accept what you've done like everyone else and keep living.

5160,"&gt;From about 1991 to 1998 Russia lost nearly 30% of its real gross domestic product (GDP), suffered numerous bouts of inflation that decimated the savings of Russian citizens. Russians also saw their disposable incomes rapidly decline. Further, the capital was leaving the country en masse, with close to $150 billion worth flowing out between 1992 and 1999.

In the midst of these negative indicators, Russia would manage to eke out 0.8% growth in 1997, the first positive growth experienced since the collapse of the Soviet Union. But just as things were beginning to look optimistic, the financial crisis that began in Asia in the summer of 1997 soon spread to Russia causing the ruble to come under speculative attack. The currency crisis would soon be exacerbated by the drop in oil prices at the end of the year, and in the middle of 1998, Russia devalued the ruble, default on its debt, and declare a moratorium on payments to foreign creditors. Real GDP growth became negative again in 1998, declining by 4.9%.

*Increasing*?

It's like you ignore literally everything that has happened since the fall of the USSR.

The response to that was to [expand Eastwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union), stop the people from looking for a better future in Western Europe by taking them into the club of the EU and elevate their country's economies and standards up with the rest of the EU.

5265,"So I’ve seen a lot of threads here about immigration and “asylum seekers” from Africa. I just thought I should share an answer I found on Quora where an African guy describes the current problem. So there’s 3 myths to be dispelled: 1) that African immigrants are mainly migrating to Europe (a lot of people there who think about immigrating migrate to other African countries); 2) that these people are “refugees” or “asylum seekers” fleeing from danger — no they are economic migrants; 3) that these people are poor — most are middle class.

It’s quite eye opening and worth a read:  https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-Africans-crossing-the-dangerous-shores-to-escape-to-Europe-when-they-could-just-go-to-another-prosperous-country-in-Africa-like-Ghana-Rwanda-Tanzania-Seychelles-Equatorial-Guinea-Mauritius/answer/Didier-Champion

I’ve pasted the contents here for those who can’t access it:

The simple answer to your question is plain ignorance.

Many Africans do not have a full picture of Europe. Our image of Europe is based on what we see on TV, what we learned in schools and NGO staff and workers from developed nations who work in Africa.

They are much more one might add but they all come down to a few things.

Lack of a full picture of life in Europe. Busy lives, harsh winter weather, work conditions, basic necessities and how much they cost.
Eurocentric education. Francophone countries are the worst. A student finishing up high school in Cote d’Ivoire might graduate knowing more about Paris ( the capital of France) than Abidjan ( his nation’s capital).
Fellow Africans who live in Europe do not help to educate their fellow Africans back home. The “show off” game is very big and very upsetting. This applies to those who have made it and those who are struggling to make ends meet.
African governments failing to inspire their citizens for their future in the country.
Imagine everytime your president gets sick, they go to London or Paris. There is no illness that South Africa or Mauritius won’t heal. On taxpayers money, they go to Europe in presidential private jets.
Imagine when you see that all the politicians’ children and those from the richest families send their kids to Europe or the US.
In the end, if you are unemployed, you have nothing to lose anyway. It is the sad reality but it is the truth.
The European Football effects.

On TV, we follow football. English Premier League is the most watched league in Africa. We watch games and keep up with players' salaries, how much they are getting bought by teams, and so on. When we hear that a player earns $100,000.00 a week, we just assume that we will be rich as soon as we land in Europe.

This is why many of West Africans crossing the shores spent between $ 3, 000-$10,000 trying to make it to Europe at all cost. This money could have been used to start a small/medium business in their home countries. Instead, they sell all their belongings based on fantasy dreams and overpaid soccer players.

The aid industry in Africa.

Many NGO staff who work in Africa lives like kings and queens. A big number of them earn western salaries while living in Africa. Imagine earning close to a six-figure salary and a bunch of bonuses while working in a developing nation. You really live a decent lifestyle in Africa. Big mansions, big cars, ravish vacations to luxuries hotel, you name it. The white savior mentality, etc. All in the name of “helping” the poor. All they do is to enrich themselves.

An average African assumes that they made all that money in their home countries before coming to Africa. The “LG ( Life is Good in Europe) mentality is very big.

For young people whose education systems have failed with record high unemployment rates, their eyes are faced towards Europe. Those folks are ambitious and want to make the best out of their lives. However, their governments and leaders have failed them big time.

Fellow Africans Abroad does not help.

To salt to the injury, those of us (their fellow Africans) who come to Europe do not give a full view of what life in Europe is. We like to show off big time. Our friends back home who follow us on Instagram, Facebook and elsewhere, get the idea that we have made it over there when in reality many are faking it.

Many Africans might be struggling to make ends meet. However, when our friends back home ask us the question: “how is life in Europe?”; many Africans will just lie. A fellow African might be homeless in Paris, but they will send their pictures in front of the Eiffel Tower on a borrowed smartphone, just to show off.

In the end, you end up with fellow Africans embarking on desperate journeys of shame and mediocrity. Some countries in Africa are very well-developed, but in our minds, any country in Europe is all milk and honey.

Many of those folks don’t know the difference between Portugal and Germany, Hungary and Italy, France and Latvia, Europe is Europe and that’s all that matters. Given a choice, an African will go to Hungary before Botswana or Mauritius. They just have no idea of the economics of other African countries. The Europe they see on TV based on football, and a few other things are all milk and honey.

Those folks might hear that the minimum wage is $15 an hour. They would convert into local currencies and get excited about the money. They might not know that the monthly rent of a one bedroom apartment might be $ 1,000.00-$1,500.00. Without even thinking about work visas and other legal pathways, they start dreaming and fantasizing about Europe. For those who have not traveled to other countries, the concept of “cost of living” is very hard to grasp.

So much more examples to add but hope this is a good summary for you.

How to help.

Access to information about real life in Europe can help.

We can only reverse this trend by educating our fellow Africans. At least, teach them how things work in Europe ( the good and the bad). Learn about other African countries who are doing well and what they have done to get there.

People can make their countries’ economic situations better instead of dreaming about the fantasy Europe. For those who move there illegally, their dreams turn into nightmares. See the story below and learn more.

I sold all I had to go to Europe - now I'm home, and broke

My Personal Story

A few months ago, a good friend of mine from West Africa reached out to me. David is a very good friend of mine. When I moved to Ghana for my days in research. I had no idea of what Ghana was all about. Throughout my days there, he helped me to navigate through lots of things in Ghana. Without him, I would have been lost. He would translate for me, teach me how things work in Ghana, etc.

When the vehicle at the research center was not available, he would help my team to find an alternative. David is a very smart and ambitious guy. We are still best friend, 3 years after I finished my work there. David has an MBA in finance, from a local university in Ghana. He teaches business and entrepreneurship in high school. In addition, he has a taxi business to take people from places to places. When I was in Ghana, he was kinda like my private driver for personal leisure trips and a tour guide.

He took me to the airport multiple times. By the time, I left Ghana. We had become really good friends. A couple of times, he expressed his interests to advance his studies in the US. However, prior to meeting him, he had applied so many times at the US Embassy in Accra ( Ghana) that they could not even give him a student visa.

After 3 times of getting rejected, the embassy gets overwhelmed and you get blacklisted. I assume he lost lots of money on application fees and travel to Accra. They are not refundable and three times require some dedication.

At the time, I initially thought I could help him navigate through grad school application to some US universities. Help him study for GRE and do better to make his dreams come true. After all, I moved to the US with a full scholarship in ‘08. However, the US was not an option for him at all. At the time, I did not know that much about European education, so I was of no help.",,/r/europe/comments/g9ge3z/perspective_on_african_migrants_to_europe_from_an/fot94st/,FirstAmount0,1588047554
5266,"Fast forward 3 years later, I stayed in touch with David. This summer, I got the following message. It was very unusual for David. We talk about anything, from women, money, investment, personal development, and so on. The message was as follows.

Sometimes I get confused about what to do with my life... I know I want to be successful.. I work hard every day to become financially independent.. But I don't know why.. I don't appreciate my effort here ( Ghana) but keep thinking of having plans to travel to Europe.. Any advice?

Knowing David, I knew I had to move on and respond fast. He is a very determined guy. Really smart and a true hustler. Prior to sending this message, he told me that now he had switched his priorities. His business has been doing very well and had been saving all the monies he made from our research team, and elsewhere. He had saved between $5,000.00—$7, 000.00. This is a lot of money in Ghana.

David is really smart. On this issue, he was just misinformed. As far as moving to Europe, just like many fellow Africans, he was quite naive and ignorant too. I asked of his plans to come to Europe. Truth to be told, he had no plan at all. He had saved all that money to make it to Europe at all cost.

In his words, he just wanted to come to Europe and hustle from there. I have been working in Germany for 2 years now, so I knew it was time to help him explain all the procedures and what is needed to come to study or work in Europe.

Initially, his plan sounded like those of who embarked to the Mediterranean journey. So, I started explaining how Europe works from A to Z.

As you know, Finding your niche and success is not an overnight success. It takes so much time, effort and determination, which I know that you have from my encounter with you in Ghana.

Now that brings me to the last part of your question. Where and how to be successful?

Deciding to travel to Europe, US, and other developed world is a good idea. However, you really have to think hard about it. The key to any question is how to live and adjust there?

What are you going to do and do you have the necessary requirements to do that?

Initially, David responded.

I know I have what it takes to hustle there. My only concern is how to get there. I have enough money and can get up to $10K if I sold my 2 cars.

At this point, I felt obligated to help my best friend out. Give him a full picture of legal versus illegal migration, student and work visas in Europe, the best way to achieve his desired wish and goals, and the consequences of moving to Europe, illegally.

This last question is the most important of all. How to get there?

Life in Europe or the US is really hard. You can struggle and survive if you have something to do. But if you don't, you will live miserably here. I meet so many Africans in Europe who cannot even find a one-way ticket back home because they came here and overstayed their visa.

But now, they cannot find work or don't have other means to make a decent living, so they end up in the streets. Lying to their families and friends back home. But in reality, they are struggling to make ends meet, living much more miserable lives than what they were living in Africa.

Then our conversation went very real about Life in Europe. I felt guilty because David is my best friend in real life and on any social media. I felt like my post about my travels had portrayed a “lavish” lifestyle of milk and honey. When in reality, it is far from that. Like my best friend, I gave him both sides of the story.

One of the big misconceptions is that once you make it to Europe, you can hustle. But it is not true. You can hustle if you have the right legal paperwork such as work visa and permits to work.

The EU have tightened up their rule and regulations so nobody can work without a work visa. This is very different from our situations back home. Here any employer has to get your work visa before employing you. Once you don't have it, nobody can employ you on the job market. You are simply illegal and you are viewed as a criminal. It is very dehumanizing, to be honest.

The Africans I have met in Spain or France, with no papers, are not lazy. They come here with dreams and aspirations. But the complicated part is that they cannot get legal paperwork to work because they came via inappropriate channels.

If you can find a good way to come to Europe legally, that would be awesome.

David responded.

I appreciate the honesty bro!! That's the beginning of my problems.. How does one get the necessary legal paperwork and visa permits in order to be able to get the opportunities.. to realize one’s dreams

Honestly, I have enough savings and investment I made just to make this dream a reality.. I just want my daughter to have a better life and experience than I have growing up..

That last sentence hit me hard. We all want the best for our families. David is just as ambitious as me ( if not more). Heck, he even has more net worth than me. Do I have $10K laying around? Nope. Back in Ghana, David does not rent. He lives in his big brother house. He has his own place. I used to visit him on weekends and watch premier league games with him.

On paper, he is even way richer than many fellow Americans. How many percentages of Americans who have $5K cash in savings, laying around. Ready to use for any emergency. Not that many. We just use credit cards for everything.

Back to the story. I continue to explain how he could make it to Europe, legally. I don’t believe in caging people in one location. The universe knows I am a nomad myself. I have lived in 4 countries for the past 10 years. Not just visiting, but actually working and living. I am all about the free movement of people as long as one abides by local immigration rules and regulations. The outcomes are better that way.

Below is my solid advice to David.

One way to do that is applying to a university in Europe. If you already have a bachelors degree, apply for a master's program. Universities in Europe are not as expensive as those in the US. But the living expenses are really high though. Some might even offer you scholarships once you get admitted. Come here as a student, go to school here and FINISH your degree. Then, apply for a work visa after your education. It is the most realistic way I know. It is not easy but it can be done.

But understand that the grass is not greener in Europe too. Life is quite tough too. You will have some challenging times and struggle as well. But whatever you do, take your time. Do your research. Analyze your plans. Don't rely on what your friend's friends told you or what you have heard from people. I have been in these countries for a while, so I know more than I can tell you in a Facebook post.

Our conversations went on for a while. Talking, texting, through multiple platforms. Whatsapp, facebook, you name it.

After two weeks, David himself sent me this link about those fellow Africans who have been hustling in Europe. This is when I knew my conversations had been very productive. I would be lying if I told you that I did not breath some fresh air of relief. My social media posts almost got my best friend in the wrong direction.

Here is the message David sent me with the link.

I sold all I had to go to Europe - now I'm home, and broke

He had been researching more about this topic and had a good understanding of migration to Europe. David finally told me;

All the glitters are not gold.

Thank God we had people like you to provide good and informative advice.

Some of us would have made similar mistakes.

A lot of lessons to be learned.

Their stories were very pathetic bro.

My response to David.

In the end, knowledge is power.

It is only with enough information that you can make well-informed decisions about your life and future. I myself am living in the West, but I would not lie to anybody about the shiny objects with darkness inside.

In the end, David changed his mind and decided to invest his savings into his 3rd taxi car. He lives nearby a research center where lots of researchers come to work. Many of my American and European colleagues still work and travel there. Whenever they are about to come, or new researchers, I recommend David for their transportation needs, and intro to culture and how things work in Ghana.

David has been balling for a while now. We are still in touch and can’t express my gratitude that with enough information, he made up his mind to stay in Ghana.

What angers me is that there are many folks like David, who are really smart and have been sold the wrong dream. A nightmare of success in other people’s lands. The fact that guys like David who are very successful ( in their home countries) see their future in the West is a big problem.

This is where African leaders and governments are making big mistakes. They have failed to inspire their young millennials. David is a little older than me but he is still hella young, ambitious, and energetic. We have gone back and forth about the problems in his community, from corruption and unpatriotic leaders, youth unemployment rates, and a multitude of African issues, etc.

He loves Ghana very much, but his definition of success had been shaped by going abroad to hustle. Until recently, It might have been the case.

I work in Germany today. I don’t kid myself about my “success”. Real success is what you have earned and built in your home country. Whatever country you are most connected with, by heritage or other personal connections. For me, that country is Rwanda, my Wakanda. Whatever I have in the West is very temporary. What I have and build in Rwanda is permanent. It will be there forever and ever.

Estonia has a media literacy score of 70, while Germany has 64?  It could be...but there's nothing in this black box methodology that makes me believe it's true. Or false.

This black box is worse than most because it includes as criteria the results of two *other* black boxes. 

I mean, why should *Pisa* scores count for 40%, while university education counts for 5%? Does ""resilience"" really mostly depend on how well 15-year-olds do on a test?

Or, better still, do a poll asking a representative sample of people from each country questions from Hans Rosling's ""Factfulness"", which is exactly about how to combat fake news.

The problem is, of course, that it's much easier to just create a formula to which you can plug in things you can easily find on the internet...and you can tweak the numbers so you can give a scientific looking ""score"" to each country.

From their lead story:

&gt;Trump made a bold bet: that by breaking precedent and engaging directly with Kim Jong Un, he could convince the brutal young autocrat to give up his nuclear arsenal in exchange for future economic gains.

&gt;But the approach, which has included three face-to-face meetings, has resulted in no such breakthrough while arguably disempowering top aides to Trump as well as U.S. diplomats. Some U.S. officials have found it hard to even get in touch with their North Korean counterparts; in some prominent cases, they’ve been publicly scorned. Trump’s game plan also essentially sidelined U.S. allies in Asia, as well as U.S. rival China, all of whom have a great deal at stake in Pyongyang’s future.

Oh please, the Soviet system was some dysfunctional shit and extremely brutal when very brutal men where in charge, but Yelstin being crap was mostly on Yelstin, and Yelstin being shit (and the US sitting on its arse being stupid because they thought that history was over) brought Putin. Central Asia was despotic as it is viewed hard to control and today is overall despotic.

The Caucasus has been a free-for-all before Russia got there and a source of constant bloodshed since the ancient Roman Empire due to its strategic position and features some very ancient nationalisms. Most of Eastern Europe had been a slaughterhouse long before the Soviet Union appeared. 

The fall of the USSR was no great thing due to the geopolitical mess it created, in the same way the USSR was nothing good as it was an oppressive totalitarian regime, and what was before wasn't something good and what is today is regressing back to the past.

US policies are incredibly complex, do people think the US became a superpower by accident? I mean geographic destiny, historical luck, all played into it. But the US didn't win the cold war by being stupid. It has many decisive wins(regardless of their morality) in Europe, in Latin America, in Korea. The US support for the three seas initiative, TPP,  Asian Pivot were all started under President Obama. Obama was a very good strategist. Now Trump was elected and has tried to burn a lot of it down(TSI he's surprisingly supported though), but having an incompetent President doesn't mean US strategy is fundamentally bad. 

And yes, American foreign policy does tend to prefer more binary relationships because that's strategically smart for the US. Of course the US would prefer if it's allies only followed it's policy. 

And anyways, US policy in Europe is working depending on what you're goals are. If your goal is to make eastern europe more independent, sow dissent in the west vs. eastern factions(which France helps handsomely). One of the best skills of US foreign policy is taking advantage of local conflict and using it to improve the US position in the region. The US doesn't force local conflict usually, it just rides the wave of whatever side it thinks will win. Of course in some cases(like Latin America during the cold war) the US was quite a bit more forceful, but I digress...

5571,"Boris Johnson has warned EU leaders they will have to change tack if there is to be a post-Brexit trade deal, with just two months to go until both sides take stock of whether an agreement is possible.
Downing Street said Mr Johnson believed that while talks might continue, it was unlikely both sides could come to an agreement that did not recognise the UK’s status as “an independent state”.

“Clearly there will need to be some political movement on the EU side,” a Downing Street official said on Monday, suggesting that heads of government would have to intervene to revise the bloc’s negotiating position.

Meanwhile Michael Gove, Cabinet Office minister, told MPs that the business turmoil caused by coronavirus would not cause the government to seek an extension to Britain’s post-Brexit transition period, which ends on December 31.

“Coronavirus in some respects should concentrate the minds of EU negotiators in underlining the importance of coming to a conclusion,” Mr Gove told MPs on the House of Commons committee looking at trade talks. Experience from years of Brexit talks with Brussels showed that “whenever a deadline was extended, the light at the end of the tunnel was replaced by more tunnel”, he said.

Mr Gove said that a prolongation would require Britain to make a financial contribution to the EU budget that “could be spent on our NHS”. The UK would also have to apply any new European laws “over which we would have no say”, he said.

Britain is adamant that Brussels must scrap core planks of its negotiating stance if a deal is going to be possible, including demands that the UK guarantee long-term access to its fishing waters and sign up to a regulatory “level playing field.” The UK is also opposed to the EU’s desire to place the whole relationship under a single treaty, complete with a governance system.

Britain insists that its vision of a relationship based around a standalone trade deal is grounded in international precedents; the EU argues that the UK wants unprecedented market access for a country outside the single market, and that the EU’s proposals reflect the unique circumstances of Brexit.

Mr Johnson, who returned to work on Monday after a serious bout of coronavirus, is expected to take a bigger personal role in the talks as they reach a crucial phase. Two further negotiating rounds are planned before an EU-UK stocktaking summit in June.

Access to Britain’s fishing waters has become a particular flashpoint. 

The EU wants the UK to agree to a treaty that preserves at least a large part of the bloc’s existing fishing rights; Britain insists that it will not go beyond the kind of agreement the EU has with Norway, which leaves access to waters up to annual negotiation.

“Their behaviour suggests that they regard the UK not as a fully sovereign independent state,” Mr Gove said.

He said the EU’s approach to the future-relationship talks was to treat Britain similarly to a country seeking closer relations with the bloc, “like the Ukraine”.

Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, warned on Friday that the bloc would never sign a trade deal without guarantees on fish.

Mr Gove addressed the EU’s insistence that Britain commit to continue upholding the European Convention on Human Rights as a precondition for a future security partnership, confirming that the government would not leave the international accord.

But russia (just like france), still has the ambition to remain relevant,and thus independant. If we offer them a deal that is different than what the chinese are offering (basically becoming a puppet state of Beijing), the russian would surely accept it. Of course, before any of it can happen, we need to reset relations.

You underestimate our softpower abroad. It's a fine weapon, if you invest in it that is.

Russia is openly against the EU because it served american interests. If we were to distant ourselves from the US, surely russia would change its tone. The EU has always been the first investor in russia before the sanctions (that too is a fine weapon if you you it correctly).

The marshall plan was created to avoid to spread of communism, it wasn't out of good grace. The US keeps its interest in mind, and we should keep ours too.

You fear the past, and I completely understand it. But be careful not to let it blind you.

The USSR only created the tsars wet dream. You mistake interests with ideology.

5607,"&gt; Why do you think the US's economy is so large? 

Lots of reasons, but starting off with an entire continent's worth of untapped resources was one big reason. And an open market of 327 million high income people does not hurt. Also, the US worker is one of the most productive in the world.

&gt; Because the US has had exclusive trade treaties with half the world.

No, not true at all. The US has run a significant trade deficit ever since the late 1970's. 

&gt;Why did the US have these treaties?

Well, the US did not. Post-WW2, the US sold a lot of goods because we had the only large functioning manufacturing economy left. Since that time, the US has consistently backed Free Trade Agreements.

&gt;Europe bought Oil from the US, not the USSR, go figure.

Only recently has Europe bought oil from the US.

&gt;US crude oil exports have risen sharply since Congress voted to lift the export ban. In January 2016, in the immediate period following the lifting of the crude oil export ban exports of US crude oil were just 490,000 barrels per day with all volumes destined for Canadian refineries. In the first eight months of 2019, total exports surged to average around 2.8 million bpd, a five-fold percentage increase in three years, based on data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Russia is the main supplier of oil to Europe, by the way. (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2c.html)

Where are we?

&gt;Armament was the US's strategy to get access to markets which they couldn't simply subdue and exploit like their colonies in South America.

OK, that was good for a laugh. No, the US has no ""colonies"" in South America. Have to be honest, that took away any desire I have to talk to you, but I might as well finish this out.

&gt;Without the US as its protective power the middle east is being ravaged by Russia, SA, Iran and Turkey, resulting in a never ending war, cruel genocides and countless victims. 

Ah yes. The peaceful Middle East. Shattered by the US. What does South Africa have to do with the ME, though? And why can't Europe defend the interests there? I am so glad that we are finally kicking the sand of that particular corner of the world from our boots.

5660,"I believe the angry messages of our prime ministers are because of the following:

Italy and Spain are coming from years of government budget cuts to stay in the ( not always reasonable) european fiscal compact rules.

Specifically Italy is using a lot of money to maintain the payments on the debt interest and those are in big part a result of interest rates.

Italy is dancing financially to keep those interest rates as low as possible and in the moment of a big crisis (covid in this case) there are out there many people trying to speculate on the capacity of italy to maintain this debt.

Italy has then demanded some messages from Eu ( ECB)  telling to the markets that situation will be kept under control at any ( possible ) cost, what ECB said? Nothing! At the same time I believe the Dutch PM told something like Italy has many problems and Europe will not give a cent.

This results in interest rates beggining to climb up, the last think a country in the middle of a shutdown need!

This is not to say that italy need a big gift from eu but certainly need some reassurance from Eu and central banks in those kind of moments ( even fake).

This is why at some point our president mattarella went out of his way to tell that this is not how eu is supposed to act during those kind of moments, apologies from EU has followed.

I'm half Dutch myself and my Uncle is a middle rank employee in the Dutch retirement fund, last time I have visited him he told me the same things as you did, cities pushing out citizens with exxagerates cost of living,housing etc.. Utrecht is a good example.

In my view I would suggest Yanis Varoufakis speeches against broken current Eurozone system, there are plenty in YouTube.

Some of his thoughts ( which I share) are as follows

Italian economy seems to be not capable to stay in the current European jacket.

Italy seem condemned to a more prolonged economic stagnation, because the local companies are not being competitive as a whole, incapable of saving capitals to invest in productivity growth and doomed to failure ( there are exception in the north of Italy) against northern competitors.

In a world without Euro, the local currency of Italy would become cheaper and the northern ( German) woul become more expensive to the point that import from Germany would increase and italians would decrease within the Eurozone balancing out all the differences in productivity.

In the Eurozone this is not happening:

In those conditions of Eurozone, capitals from Italy move to Germany and pile up over there, as a result Germans ( and Dutch) has a lot of money that doesn't know where to go, at the end much of the money is being invested(with loans)  back to southern europe because it has a higher yeld than the north.

As a results also Italian banking sector become a zombie because the internal demand is weak, a lot of companies go bankrupt messing up everything.

Normally zombie banks are bailed out by the state adding up to public debt.

From time to time we can see an economical crisis and suddenly the southern ( or periherical) economies ( think Greece, but also Ireland) will not be able to pay those loans back to the north.

As a result I believe that neither Dutch Germans and Italians are gaining from this game.

The more we continue saving the Eurozone the bigger the collapse we will see.

Somehow the profits from the north has to be collected in a Federal government and has to be spent to rebalance this kind of imbalances within Eurozone.

I'm worried this will not happen anytime soon and so some are suggesting that Germany ( and the Nederlands ) should try to leave the Eurozone as they are the countries most in shape at the moment ( with merits but also with some Eurozone help) and at the same time a big problem and let the Euro be used in more homogeneous economies as France, Italy, Spain and Eastern Europe.

5706,"In the 1800’s and early 1900’s there was an economic policy was economic liberalism. Economic liberalism was about reduced tariffs and more economic competition between companies in a lightly regulated economy.

Economic liberalism decreased in practice after the Great Depression in the 1930’s and during World War II when economies became much more tightly regulated. Then in the 1970’s both the US and Europe started privatizing state owned assets and reducing what were seen as excess regulations. Basically, an policy meant to have a more competitive private sector.

So like in 1980 the US deregulated the railroad industry and allowed railroad companies to choose whether to use their rail lines for freight or passenger traffic, where before they were required to carry passenger traffic. That was neoliberalism. Or when the EU enforces competition law, that is neoliberalism.


Or... there used to be environmental laws to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from factories. Each factory was only allowed to pollute so much. Then people realized that some types of factories can reduce pollution more than others, so a pollution cap was set for the whole industry and then the individual factories could be and sell the right to pollute between each other. So like if one factory could reduce pollution really cheaply, then they would do so, and sell their excess pollution rights to other factories. That was a classic neoliberal policy introduced in the 1990’s so that factories had an incentive to reduce pollution in the most efficient way. 


In practice, modern people usually just use the term “neoliberalism” to many any policy that is remotely capitalist. Like if some politician wants to reduce regulation, the opposing people don’t want to say they are “pro regulation” because that doesn’t sound good. So instead they say they’re “anti-neoliberalism”, because it’s easier to say you’re “anti-neoliberalism” than say you’re “anti-capitalism”",,/r/europe/comments/g8vffg/chomsky_on_covid19_the_latest_massive_failure_of/for87no/,CheWeNeedYou,1588007833

When did we say we will not make a stand against China on millions being forced into camps where they're brainwashed, raped, tortured and even killed for simply being of a certain regional and religious background?

When did we become cowards? Before you begin to blame our leadership, perhaps look at one another, the actual citizens. 

Everyone here is constantly reminded of how perfect Europe is through fluffed charts and filtered photos but at what point exactly do we stop calling everyone else in the world sheeple and start taking *our* blinders off? 

If you think the ONLY way to fiscal prosperity is through China, that there are no other Asian or Western European countries capable of manufacturing, it MUST be China then you are part of the problem. Similar to how if you think Nokia's 5G is not a solution, it MUST be Huawei's 5G, EU cannot create and should not create our own infrastructures - again, you are part of the problem. 

For all of our pride, all of our so-called 'intellectual superiority' we sure have become used to the idea of being the 3rd pillar of the world, not the first. Meanwhile US and China are in a league of their own, but EU competing.. nah.

where do we claim jurisdiction over the US? if we don't like what the US companies are doing in the EU we curtail them. that is EU having jurisdiction over the EU. you seem to think not taking it in the ass is having jurisdiction over the US?

&amp;#x200B;

Due to a trip to Taiwan, the late Senate President Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) was under enormous pressure. Three days before his death, the Chinese ambassador spoke to him alone at the embassy reception to celebrate Chinese New Year. According to his wife Věra and daughter Vendula Vinšová, these circumstances contributed to the deterioration of his health and death. As they said on the ČT 168 hours program, the former chairman of the Senate behaved abnormally in the last days of his life.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly he was really different, he wasn't talking, we could hardly see him. Or we saw him, he made coffee, he left and he didn't talk. My mother also complained that she wasn't talking, that she wasn't used to it, they had been together for a very long time. Suddenly, my father did not speak, ""the daughter Vendula described Kuber's last days in the Czech Television's 168 Hours program.

&amp;#x200B;

According to his wife Věra, his behavior changed after a New Year's lunch with President Miloš Zeman. In addition to them, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Radek Vondráček (ANO) and the Castle Chancellor Vratislav Mynář also took part.

&amp;#x200B;

""He came home from that lunch, and other times he always told me everything. He didn't tell me anything this time, just that it went normally. He was sick, he walked around the garden in the evening, he was nervous, which I was surprised, because maybe it happened for the first time in my life in 52 years that we were together, ""described Věra Kuberová.

&amp;#x200B;

It was at this lunch that he was to receive a letter from the Chinese embassy.

&amp;#x200B;

Further pressure on the then President of the Senate was to take place three days later directly at the Chinese embassy. ""When we arrived in Prague, they divided us. The husband was taken to a room where he was only with the ambassador and the Chinese translator. No one else of our people was allowed there. I was taken to the hall, the program was extended by 20 minutes before it started. My husband came, and when I asked him what was happening, he said, 'Nothing, the ambassador will be recalled because I did not back down,' Kuber described.

&amp;#x200B;

The event was also attended by the director of the secretariat of the President of the Senate Petr Kostka: ""The meeting lasted ... I do not know ... half an hour and then we just quickly joined the other guests and went to the performance for the new Chinese year. He just whispered to me that he would probably be recalled. I suppose he meant the ambassador, and I deduced from this that the ambassador had told him that if he insisted on the road or carried it out, he would have a problem as an ambassador. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier heart attack

Three days later, Jaroslav Kubera died. Probably for a heart attack. ""According to the doctor's information, the heart attack was already from Friday or Saturday. There was an ODS congress on Saturday, and a meeting at the Chinese embassy on Friday. So the heart attack was older. It corresponds to that stressful situation, I think. I'm so proud of Dad. I'm proud of him because he didn't back down. He didn't back down and we really perceive it as costing him basically his life, ""added Vendula Vinšová.

Three letters to the Castle

Mynáře was previously defended by President Miloš Zeman. ""The Chancellor has publicly stated that Diary N is lying and that nothing like this has happened. So what do you want more? ”He said on Frequency 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Where the letter from the Chinese embassy came from, which lacks an introduction and signature, the foreign committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Miloš Vystrčil (ODS), is also trying to find out. He had already sent three letters to the Castle asking for an explanation. He received the answer only once, but it was the same statement that Mynář sent to the media.

&amp;#x200B;

He pushed out on Twitter on Monday that he continued to demand an explanation of the whole case: ""I will continue to deal intensively and fiercely with the origin, purpose and consequences of the Chinese document. I will do my best to make the truth come out. I owe it to Jaroslav Kuber and his family. At the same time, I consider it absolutely essential for the preservation of our sovereignty and freedom.
