0,"Sorry, but this is the most fucked up idea humans could came up with. We still don't understand entirety of how Earth's ecosystems work. Each of our estimates about the rate of global warming were underestimating it. Scientist are being surprised each year. They didn't think permafrost melting could be happening at this rate in current year, but here it is. They didn't expect Amazon forest to release CO2 instead of absorbing it so soon, but here it is. They didn't expect the east side of Antarctica to melt so fast, but it already is. I could go on.

So yes, we should totally play with dimming the Sun? What the worst that could happen? Let's see... a massive dying out of a phytoplankton, causing massive starvation in Oceans, breakage of entire food chains, and lowering oxygen production in Ocean which would only speed it up.

86,"It has only broken the record of 1927 in the Netherlands. We don't know how things went before that because we don't have the data (but we do know that it happened only a few times in recorded history). The fact that the records aren't new underlines how much of a freak accident this is. Its an outlier to a pattern but not part of the pattern itself.

In the Netherlands the dikes around rivers need to withstand 1 in 1000 year events up to 1 in 5000 year events in critical areas. So whenever something floods, you can be pretty sure that its a freak incident that is pretty hard to predict and pretty hard to fix. For the sea the dikes need to withstand 1 in 5000 to 1 in 10000 year events. Hence why the Netherlands hasn't flooded there in a long time and probably not will in a long time too. 

Records that double or more, mind you that you are probably talking about a record set in winter, not summer, are outliers. Its the same reason why New Orleans hasn't been hit by a tornado like in 2005. Those events don't happen that often. Same as in the Netherlands that had a massive storm in 1953 that we haven't seen before or after that. This summer it has been raining a lot more than ever before and when its breaking winter level records on how much water flows down. Its not climate change. Its a freak incident that will not happen again in a long time. But these have existed for all of humanity and there's not a major effect from climate change that you can predict.

102,"Well, the French town is also a *lot* older than 1992. Like I said, there's a *Roman* bridge in it that resisted flood after flood when more recent structures didn't.

But the French town did three crucial mistakes:

1. They walled the riverbed in concrete and denied it its *floodplains* and natural range. This gave them an illusion of control, when it had the opposite, aggravating effect.  
2. They built their houses closer and closer to the riverbed. Right onto top of it, even.
3. They allowed a lot of hills along the river to be deforested. For development among others. The trees held the soil in place. Without them, there was erosion and an increased risk of landslide.

All it took was one particularly rainy year for the dominos to fall one after the other.

I have no idea who the people you're talking about are. You know nothing of Roma history. If you actually want evidence, fine:

Read Dicionário da História de Portugal by Portuguese historian Joel Serrão. It has a chapter on the history of Roma people in Portugal. They have been discriminated since the beggining. Do you speak Portuguese? No? Fuck, maybe that's why I didn't give you my source.

Besides that, I'm talking about my own experiences with Roma people. I gave you an example. They can't get jobs. I think that's a pretty big caveat. I never said there weren't any problems with their culture. There are, obviously, but isolated communities only become more isolated when faced with system oppression and discrimination.

Even Roma who do not follow Roma culture and lifestyle face discrimination and oppression all over Europe. That's a fact. I know this from my own experience as someone from Europe.

Also I hope for your sake that you see the irony in this:

404,"Youre right, and if you look at the picture youll see this river didnt cover the mountains. The point is that basically every river has a flood plain which a relatively flat area extending out from the river. These areas will be flooded every few years to varying degrees. You can also look at a FEMA maps for a river near you and they will map the 100 year floodplain for insurance companies. Other things to keep in mind is the topography, this looks relatively mountainous so this might not be a major river such and as such has a much lower time of concentration which makes it much peakier and thus more prone to flooding or even flash flooding. The advantage is that the flooding is contained to the valley. The opposite end is flat areas like the midwest where floodplains are absolutely massive so large areas will get flooded, just usually with not that much water depth. These areas will also usually have higher time of concentrations due to the flat slopes, so it has to rain for days and days to get major flooding.

&amp;#x200B;

Also side note its probably a flood plain, it doesnt have to be a river bed. Sediment is usually deposited during flood events since very fast moving water in the channel erodes sediment from upstream and when it gets over the flat vegetated plains it slows down. This combined with the fact that flood waters recede they will drop off sediment over time. This leads to very fertile ground as well which is why many civilizations grew up around rivers such as the nile and tigris. Its also part of the reason the midwest has very good soils, because again the mississipi has massive floodplains that cover a lot of area, as well as other rivers in the region.",,/r/europe/comments/okz0yb/the_before_and_after_image_gives_an_idea_of_the/h5c5ok5/,deftwolf,1626393183

Sure, man can build dams and levees and reservoirs, but if a river wants to flood, it’s going to flood. Our species has made these floods more likely. The economics will, at some point, make rebuilding non-teneble. It’d be terrible if large chunks of my childhood town went underwater, but that’s the reality now.

If something is not sufficient to cause x, how will it always result in x? 

&gt;What no one can deny is that the Plaza Accord had a major role in it.

Except economic consensus on the matter is that Plaza Accord was a small external factor and not the main vector of cause. Similarly how large east Asian central bank inflows into US prior to 2008 helped cause the subsequent financial crisis.

&gt;This is pretty ironic considering the people that have been ""clutching their pearls"" have been Westerners wishing for the Chinese bubble burst since 2001. Don't miss this year's ""The Coming Collapse of China: 20th edition"".

They might as well have. The parallels are many, as are there important differences. Chinese system is much more regulated than Japanese, they do not have a free float for example.

Austria that dominated german state policy for centuries both as its most influential state and as its self proclaimed protector until prussia kicked them out.

And they were part of the german realm and the holy roman empire LONG before Hungary and Austria became an entity. For most of its time the Austrian Empire was made up of modern Austria and Bohemia (modern Czechia) + later Silesia.

Both Vienna and Prag were, as part of the Austrian empire, the defacto capital of the Holy Roman Empire for centuries as well.

During the 1848 revolution german nationalists also rose up in austria like in the rest of germany and the ""greater german solution"" (prussia and austria into germany) was a valid point and scenario of reunification untiol prussia decided they didnt like that.

The austrian part of the habsburg empire was part of the german confederation right until germany was founded in 1871. That is barely 62 years until Hitler took power.

Saying Austrians are not german is some serious denial of history.

People would give you an answer if you asked, but they really wanted to talk about the economy, the NHS, welfare/benefits and then migration.

The problem was that Farage's UKIP was drawing votes from a small minority of people. Not enough to ever win a seat, but enough to slightly split the right-wing vote and give Labour a better chance of winning. So David Cameron promised a referendum - most people didn't care, most people thought we would vote to stay, but that killed off the UKIP threat.

But then when we asked people to vote, we first had a year of David Cameron ""negotiating"" a better deal with the EU...which went down like a lead balloon. Then we had a  year of toxic bullshit that forever split the country. And so came Brexit.

&gt;If the Council agrees to open negotiations the screening process then begins. The commission and candidate country examine its laws and those of the EU and determine what differences exist. The Council then recommends opening negotiations on ""chapters"" of law that it feels there is sufficient common ground to have constructive negotiations. Negotiations are typically a matter of the candidate country convincing the EU that its laws and administrative capacity are sufficient to execute European law, which can be implemented as seen fit by the member states. Often this will involve time-lines before the Acquis Communautaire (European regulations, directives &amp; standards) has to be fully implemented. 

&gt;Ease of accession depends on the state: how integrated it is with the EU beforehand, the state of its economy and public institutions, any outstanding political issues with the EU and (historically) how much law to date the EU has built up that the acceding state must adopt.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/okq970/eu_sues_hungary_and_poland_over_lgbtq/h5auwzw/,Canal_Volphied,1626371837

762,"&gt;Ostentatiously assassinating an important journalist is a typical trait of third world rotten states: the Netherlands appears to be a mafia-captive state and a drug heaven.

So because a big drug criminal is able to do this my whole country is a 'third world rotten country'?

&gt;But you are right: this mafia assassination doesn't seem to have been sanctioned by your government. Congratulations!

You said that Hungary's discriminatory laws are the same as a criminal killing someone. My government didn't do this, if it did your comparison would make sense but this crime has nothing to do with my government so your comparison is worthless.

&gt;Your government seems only to be a captive of the drug mafia and theoretically ""is against these groups and the crimes they commit"". You are not (yet?) directly governed by the drug mafia. Congratulations!

My country's leadership and police are actively going after these criminals so another worthless point.

&gt;What I see, is the demagogic political clown Rutte arrogantly deciding who belongs to Europe, while heading a mafia-captive government of a country where a key journalist is shot dead in the head on the street.

Rutte is an idiot at times and I personally don't like the guy or most of his policies but he's correct in saying that if your country wants to discriminate against whole groups of people they can fuck off from the union.

There might've been more rain than usual and the temperature might be higher than usual, but an area having more flooding than normal isn't climate change. Thats just climate.

1048,"The Catholic Church exists today, all over the world.  It was established and modified by Rome prior to its ""fall.""  The Catholic Church was an every day factor in European politics and society up until the Protestant Reformation, and the Renaissance in general.  The Church was evicted from a large number of north European countries or simply lost political power over strong monarchies involved with global commerce and military might.  But before that, the Catholic Church made enormous amounts of money off the huge tracts of land they owned and controlled all over Europe.  It dictated noble marriages and divorces, the outcomes of war and treaties.  Profoundly powerful.  All that changed after the Reformation, and the Church became more of a religious institution, although a powerful and underhanded political influencer.  Even today it's trying to undermine Joe Biden's influence, by questioning his commitment to his faith.

The Byzantine Empire was certainly an important political entity throughout  the medieval period, particularly in the Middle East, and southern Eastern Europe.

1163,"Maybe it's 12% across the board for average companies but it is not 12% at the large corps with HQs there. I worked at Google Ireland for a time and the effective rate was closer to 3%, the system it set up in particular to cater to those large corporations so long as they agree to maintain a large presence on the island.  

They used to use the double Irish to do this but the loophole was closed out for existing users in 2019. Since then, the big corps have started using Bermudan holding companies registered from Ireland. In that year (2019) Google Ireland paid 263m in tax, it also funnelled revenue through to its holding company so THAT company booked 13.7 billion in profit. All of which is tax free. The Irish tax system enabled all of this behavior and has actively fought against measures to curtail it because they know where their bread is buttered.

It's not some grand conspiracy on Wikipedia, just talk to anyone who works in accounting at FB, Google, apple or any huge Corp with an HQ in Ireland.

* China continues to lend in situations when Western loans aren’t being offered. 

For example, Sri Lanka was refused loans by the West because it was already extremely highly indebted and the business case for what it was planning to spend on wouldn’t pay back.

Similarly, many of their loans in Africa are made to countries with human rights abuses, or are being used to fund coal plants (for example). In these cases, Western banks would refuse any lending at all.

* There’s also a massive difference in the terms, such as higher interest rates and very brutal clauses if you fail to pay (though these are arguably a function of these countries having no alternatives to get the funding)

* Also, scandals. There have been a bunch of accusations of corruption and bribery in politicians accepting these loans (including in Montenegro).

You should know how Babiš came to power and that he was very likely the one who ordered prosecution of PM back in 2010. He was unfortunately dumb enough to resign althought he was behind immunity which as we can see was extremelly retarded. Babiš got into power as a result and he did it because that government refused to do favors for him that all previous governments did and instead appointed people in police that started investigating his activities. Former PM has always been free of any crime and did nothing wrong and he is completely irrelevant.

I think English is not your native language because your parents spoke Russian with you when you were born, since most people speak Russian in Lithuania. Listen to what I say, I gave you 5 links already.

Every NATO country have to spend %2 of it's GDP for military budget. Did you understand that? 21/29 NATO members in Europe DID NOT for 40 years until Trump spoke publicly and told them to do their share.

Are you following me or should I say in Russian for you to understand better? 

&gt; NATO didnt participate in Iraq, its your war, you should know your shit mate, im dissapointed. You had a few countries to help.you, but thats about it. Poland gave you some support with your english speaking homies. Far from whole NATO, and as an organisation, NATO wasnt involved. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War

As usual, you don't know anything. USA-UK-Italy-Netherlands-Australia-Poland are in NATO.

Did NATO help us or what, now? As usual, Wikipedia shows you that you don't know anything you're talking about HAHAHAHA. I mean according to you, Russia didn't win the war against Georgia too. It's ok, in your belief, you can believe Nazi Germany beat USSR in World War II and Nazi Germany ruled Lithuania, not USSR for 50 years.

&gt; you should know your shit mate, im dissapointed

Of course, I know. Link proved you wrong again. I think Poland-Italy-UK-Australia are NATO members and they supported us as link shows. You're going to do what we tell you to do. Always listen the Daddy, alright Ex-Soviet? LOL

&gt; In Afghanistan, it was different, because you got attacked on your soil, which activated the mutual defense clause. So intervention in Afghanistan could be counted as defense. Unless yoi dont consider razing the twin towers in New York relevant to you. 

What happened to ""defense alliance""? Hahahahahahaha. Maybe we went to Afghanistan, 15.000 miles away from home, to DEFEND, right? LOL. What happened to your claim, defense alliagance? Hahahahahaha. It's ok, Soviet. You don't know how NATO works because you just joined 15 years ago. We're here for past almost 70 years. Of course, we know more than you. You spent your 50 years as Soviet.

Yes. We did DEFEND so well against Afghanisan and NATO helped us, because they have to. Right? LOL. You're going to do what we tell you to do. If we go to Venezuela ""to defend"" in near future, NATO will have no choice but to come with us. This is Daddy Speaking.

&gt; Yes, we were actually defending New York in Afghanistan, not Iraq though, but what can I do, you're a slow learner, but you're getting there dude, good for you.

Good boy. You're gonna defend wherever we tell you to defend. That's what ""defending"" means, if we say, lets go to Venezuela, we'll ""defend"", you will come to defend with us since NATO is ""allegiance of defense"" right? LOL.  Poor guy has no idea about what's invading and what's defending hahaha.

What the hell are you talking about New York and Afghanistan, my Soviet friend? Out of 19 terrorist that hit buildings, NONE was Afghan. 16 were Saudi. What defending are you talking about? LOL.

&gt; Haha, trying to change subjects again? But its good that you acknowledge that your budget isnt NATO's budget, so you can shut about the percentages. You're spending your money on yourself, thats just obvious and official to everyone. 

Why are you afraid to compare numbers? How much are you spending on your budget? Is it $1 billion? LOL. What can you defend with that? Your house? Dude, Bill Gates spend more money to defend his island than you spend to defend your country, man. What the hell is $1 billion? hahahahaha. How long can you last to Russia with $1 billion budget? Can you last 10 minutes?

&gt; Learn the words purchasing power parity. While your economy is big, you're just 15th in the world. Dollar means nothing, I can buy 3 houses in my country for the same amount of money, your GDP is inflated without any real worth behind it. You know it. And by PPP the GDP per capita of Lithuania is almost the same as Mississippi, which is pretty sad as you never had a war on your soil and were never occupied. 

Learn the word, GDP. We're the #1 in the world. Bigger than everybody as we speak. Should we speak Lithuania? Even Bulgaria have bigger GDP than Lithuania. LOL. Should we stop talking at this point or should I also say that Belarus have bigger GDP than Lithuania too? hahahahaha.

Yo, forget about Bulgaria and Belarus, man. New Jersey are 10x richer than your country and it's one of the smallest state in US. LOL. New Jersey, man. 10 times richer than your country, man. How do you feel?

&gt; and by PPP the GDP per capita of Lithuania is almost the same as Mississippi, which is pretty sad as you never had a war on your soil and were never occupied. 

Mississippi have bunch of rednecks who are high-school drops out's mostly even they're way richer than Lithuania because their GDP is $99 billion and Lithuania's GDP is $52 billion. Thanks for the info. I just checked it now. Even the poorest, worst education-farmers are making %200 more money than Lithuanians hahaha. Yes, nobody can invade us because we're not a weak and poor country like you. Nobody CAN invade us, like they invaded your country for 50 years. No, in Mississippi, there's no borsch or kefir or sashlik or dacha. It's in Lithuania.

&gt; Sad applause for this non my text related monologue. Have you been writing it to me? Cause you made no sense here dude. But its good you acknowledged that you spend your money on yourself and dont care about the allies, I appreciate the honesty.

Why can't you answer? Why do we have soldiers in your country and defending your country since you're so technologically advanced? Do you protect our country with your soldiers? No. Why do we protect yours? I'll tell you, you're poor, Eastern-bloc country who can't even protect yourself. That's why.

&gt; Dunno, if you can count, but 2.7 million equals to 3 million, not 2. But I know thst maths is not your strongest skill, so no worries here, you're forgiven. And yes, Lithuania is a country that couldnt be erased by hundreds of years of wars and oppresion. When you drank tea and ate steaks, we killed each other in Europe year from year, but still survived. Thats how we are so united against oppressors, and you're so divided you storm your own capitol lol. Who needs enemies, when you have trump supporters? Lol.

You don't have 2,7 million population. You have 2,7 million Lithuanians in the world but they're not living in Lithuania, bro hahahaha. They all left to UK and other EU states. There's no 2,7 million people living in Lithuania.

This is why your country got invaded because it was a piece of cake for USSR. This is why your culture got changed to dacha, sashlik, borsch. They controlled you so long.

&gt; Oh man, so does land pay taxes? Is population density a known term to you? Is term per capita known you? Even our broke ass nation gives free healthcare and education, has an equivavelnt GDP of some of your states by purchasing power even after 50 years of communism. You had all the conditions in the world to be the best, but you're still behind western Europe in more or less all metrics. The fact you flex your economy against us, looks pretty desperate dude. How about you compare yourself to a country which didnt have a war on its soil too? How about Switzerland mate? Oh man, thats a shame, Switzerland makes 68k gdp ppp per capita, and USA only 62. With all those billionaires, you couldnt even keep it up. 

I'll enlighten you.

Switzerland: 703.1 billion USD (2019)

USA: 21.43 trillion USD (2019)

Yes, my country is roughly speaking 30 times richer than Switzerland. Thank you very much. Just like how New Jersey (3 times smaller than Lithuania in terms of area) is richer than Lithuania 10 times. Thank you very much. Numbers never lie. 

New Jersey LOL is 10 times richer than Lithuania. Let that sink in. 

&gt; Firstly learn to count. Secondly, you dream about us getting wrecked in 7 minutes, but all Russia could do in Georgia in 5 days is getting their soldiers killed and planes gunned down. The Abkhazia Ossetia conflict was a long skirmish already, with or without Russia it was constantly a problem for Georgia. For Russia to win this, they should have wrecked Georgia in 1 day up to Tbilisi. What they did, they acknowledged some already disputed territories while having a 7 times bigger army than Georgia deployed. And yes, Lithuania would keep it up till NATO arrives. Our panzer haubitzes would be enough to make a problem for russian tanks and artillery. 

Dude, as link showed, you have no idea what you're talking about. Either Wikipedia is wrong or Ex-Soviet in Lithuania is wrong. We know who is wrong. You said, Russia didn't win that war in your opinion hahahahahahahahaha. Link says, Russia won the war, built bases in Ossettia and kicked Georgians out. So, your war history lessons are not very helpful.

Lithuania can't keep up 7 minutes against Russia. You have less than 2 million people in the country, mostly are old people or women (since your women ratio is so high. You don't have healthy men left) Russia would take Lithuania under 10 minutes as usual. History always repeats itself, they did invade your country in 50 years.

I see that your memory is getting overloaded dude. And yeah, we eat sashlik, which is a traditional georgian and armenian food, which are sovereign nations dude. You should try it too. Its less fattening than your burgers, we dont have the obesity crisis by eating meat and veggies. 

Yes, I have, 3 times. That's how I know, Lithuania is Mini-Russia. Evrything is as same as Russia. From how people look to churches, from your food to traditions. Everything is pretty much same, just like Belarus. Well, Belarus is technically different country than Russia too but not really. 

Did Georgians ever invade Lithuania? How do you think, that sashlik came to Lithuania? Because I haven't seen sashlik in almost every restaurant in Paris, UK, Italy or Spain. Is it because those countries haven't been invaded by USSR? And you have. Is it because Georgia and Lithuania were part of same country for 50 years under USSR? Ahh I see, why now. You guys were same country just 35 years ago. That's why, you guys eat same food.

&gt; And yeah, we eat sashlik, which is a traditional georgian and armenian food, which are sovereign nations dude. You should try it too. Its less fattening than your burgers, we dont have the obesity crisis by eating meat and veggies. 

It's not Armenian. LOL. Obviously you don't even know what it is. It's Georgian. Yes, sashlik came to your country because Georgia and Lithuania were under Soviet Union. Sashlik didn't come to Lithuania in 1995 when Georgia was independent. It came in 1960's and 1970's when you guys were same country LOL. Same country, same traditions. Just like all over Soviet countries.

&gt; Huh? You mean these parades are banned in Lithuania? You better tell those people LOL. They seem not to feel banned at all. Lol. Use wikipedia, you look smarter that way.

As you say the area was occupied by nomadic and semi-nomadic groups among which were slavs, the major religious institution practiced church slavonic. Yet somehow the language won out, without any significant political power as with the Hungarians or cultural influence as with the slavization of the Bulgars.

1438,"I totally agree that there is no written sources by the romanians, so it's hard to have bulletproof fact. But according to some more recent historians who studied written history by other neighbors or even further, there was some sort of similar naming by some greek or italian mentioning, other than Wallachia.  

Anyway, my personal opinion, when the term appears in 16th century in more sources, including external, it's hard to believe that they had another term for themselves just before 16th century and quickly changed to the term rumân or Țeara Rumâneasca. They were not an entity by themselves, national or even ethnic identity were not really a thing, so hard to get people together by an identity that wasn't really a thing, all they identified themselves were more after being a christian or not. They were romanians, slavs and all others ethnic groups together against the pagans (mostly muslims at the time), because the church was the center, there was not really a romanian unity. Other major factors that worth mentioning, they  were illiterate, so hard to propagate news, and the means of communications and propagating  teachings like these would have been hard in such backwards times. And what and how they called themselves wasn't of any big importance for anyone back then. So adopting new titles seems quite hard to believe. It's more plausible that prior to writings, oral teachings from generation to generation existed in families and this is how they got the knowledge prior to 16th century. Same as the language was taught and preserved from generation to generation without any writing existing in place, same as some of our latin vocabulary persisted without the interaction with french and other sources.

Another thing to mention, a lot of things are known about our history prior to 16th century when we had written stuff, quite from the dacian times and before, but they were written for other historians (greeks etc). The term rumân existed in the middle ages, without us writing it down, it went on with the language and generations, and from what I read some sources mention it.  This word was all over the place in Europe, with different meanings, I mean, at the south of us today there was Rumelia before Tara Romaneasca existed, something like the country of the rum people. 

But anyway, it hard to form an opinion about the past because we tend to get caught in the present perspective and we tend to see things from today's perspective. Although they were defined, try imagining no real borders like today and you could just go and live there at any point. I mean, lots of vlahs did live in the south of Danube  same as many slavs lived at the north of Danube. Try imagining no national identity (mostly a new concept for everyone, not just romanians), and not much of an identity other than christians and pagans. Long story short, It's not hard proof but I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be real of historians settle it like this for now, until further discoveries.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/okfkyp/countries_that_have_at_one_point_claimed_to_be/h58kpu6/,vasile666,1626322382

But there's nothing wrong with saying ""I don't know"", despite how politically charged that has become over the centuries as identity politics came into play together with politically-motivated historic revisionism. Because, we honestly don't know and can only guess. That's a pity and shame, but it's the accurate state of affairs as of today and the illusion that we do know is, in my opinion, slightly destructive because it stop us from going deeper into that great unknown that is Romanian pre-history.

Also, just as a minor note, Muslims do not consider themselves pagans since they are People of the Book, and recognize both Christians and Jews as part of the abrahamic tradition unlike genuine pagans. Admitedly, largely irrelevant except for actual pagans that felt the difference quite acutely.

By the time of 16th century, most foreigners  have written about it as Wallachia but some did mention a similar name to what the people called the place around these parts. The term *rumân* is quite old around these parts, from the middle ages, meaning basically peasant and often confused with slave, but these people called the province later the romanian country (Țeara Rumânească), from around 13-14th century.

There is no such thing for the covid vaccine. Why do we need to vaccinate the entire world? This is unprecedented.

I never said Ivermectin is a miracle cure. I think there is no money to be made from it which is why it is being suppressed as a possibly effective way of lowering mortality or symptoms.

Vaccination also doesn't preclude that it can't be spread. So if people want to take the vaccine that should be their choice and it should be an informed choice if they believe it will protect them.

ironic that you bring it in the first place, since it was US under Nixon that opened up relations with China and also sponsored the entry of China in the WTO during the Bush jr presidency. The reason China is so bullish in its trade war is because of the failure of the US to contain it.

feel free to provide Germany with liquified gas at below cost then, because Germany has every right to look for fuel to heat up their homes and produce energy.

See how well that turned out to be).

Directive, its goal is to promote renewable forms of energy as one important part of the
Union’s energy policy. The Directive should continue to focus on this main objective. The
priority for the EU is to develop renewable fuels such as hydrogen produced from renewable
electricity and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels since renewables are projected to develop very
strongly in power generation already in this decade (and even more strongly afterwards)
while nuclear and CCS have more limited potential and, in some Member States encounter
public acceptance issues. Low carbon fuels will continue to play an important role to
decarbonise the energy sector for some time in particular in sectors where direct
electrification is not possible or renewable fuels are not yet available. This will be addressed

That is not to say that European countries are not very comfortable, but someone from say, Latin America, might find Germany or Finland very same and comforting, but eventually find it stifling, socially isolating, and drab and become unhappy living there.

On the other hand, Germans and Finns might find living in some Latin American countries where spontaneous music, dancing, and laughter are commonplace to induce happiness at first, but quickly grow weary of dangerous streets, oppressive governments, and food or electricity shortages to nagatively affect their happiness.",,/r/europe/comments/ojzmfs/the_happiest_countries_in_the_world/h56he7t/,Historical-Beach-393,1626285529

2043,"&gt; Yeah, but this isn't about the US.
&gt; 
&gt; 

I get that.  My original statement was that this list looks like someone took all the countries and ordered them from most white to least white.

The context I'm trying to give you is that to me, you sound like one of our super-racists.  Our super-racists care about national heritage on top of whiteness and our regular racists care about skin color.

&gt; It's funny how you Americans care about lack of diversity in Europe, but you don't care about literal ethnostates like China, Japan, SK or indeed, many African countries.

It's because 

* China owns kind of a big chunk of America.

Whether they're buying up our land (there's a bill in congress now trying to prevent this) or our celebrities publicly apologizing for calling Taiwan a country or our president excusing the genocide by calling it ""cultural differences"".

* We think of the world as North America and Europe and Australia.

Our public education focuses almost exclusively on western civilization.  Like if you give an average American a blank World Map, they'd be able to fill out North America, Western Europe, Russia and China but if you ask them to find Croatia or Laos on a map and they'll never be able to.",,/r/europe/comments/ojzmfs/the_happiest_countries_in_the_world/h560l6n/,AnythingAllTheTime,1626278223

But, I know you would have agreed with the thesis! You just did not think you needed to state it.

I generally do not understand this method of debating that some people use where they cannot seem to try to relay information that they share with the other. It smells like machismo or the idea that one should never agree bc that would weaken one's position. This approach is so immature, but even adults use it. It is true that our society (media) would jump all over someone if they were to admit that they are wrong and that this one expression would apparently destroy one's whole thesis or several theses or maybe even one's own whole reputation on everything related or not.

2202,"&gt; The UK is an almost perfect analog for former Yugoslavia.

You need almost perfect ignorance of the UK to think there is a good analogy to be found here. 

&gt; A country that thinks it's God's gift to humanity and thinks that they're equals with their sugar daddy (the US and Russia)

I've travelled extensively, lived on 3 different continents and have yet to meet a people as self-deprecating as English - though the Scots come close. 

'Thinks they are God's gift to humanity' - this is what happens when your entire view of a country is warped by the retarded online Brexit lens.

&gt; Then we have the one with the strange language everyone always forgets, Wales and Slovenia.

Name a major European country and I'll point out a region that speaks a funny language and that generally gets ignore. Wales actually has devolved power and gets recognised at international sporting events (such as football and rugby) which is a hell of a lot more than can be said for the other 'strange language' parts of other European countries. 

&gt; Macedonia and Jersey, the ones everyone really forgets about and when mentioned by name you need to point out that you don't mean their more famous counterparts.

Jersey isn't even a part of the UK...

&gt; And finally Scotland and Croatia, absolutely normal while living in a madhouse and no, we most certainly do not have a complex regarding that one particular other country that thinks it's soon fucking great. 

Yeah, Scotland is 'absolutely normal while living in a madhouse' is so consistent with roughly half of their population taking a look at Brexit (and the economic cost associated therewith) and deciding, 'sure, I'll have that again but on steroids please'. 

&gt; And them taking over was just pure luck and really we don't even think about them all the time at all.

Except that two kingdoms were united via succession, and then Scotland practically led the empire in conquering and subjugating the rest of the world.

Yugoslavia was a modern, geopolitical and ideological venture wrought from the ashes of spent empires.

2211,"I just want to point out that the ECHR is not a part of the EU legal order and both the Charter and any case law stemming from the ECtHR is not binding as EU law. While many EU countries are also signed up to the Charter this does not mean the ECHR enjoys the same legal weight as actual EU based law - ie. the treaties, regulations, directives, opinions and judgments. The ECHR is a delegate and distinct legal order.

A6TEU does reference the Charter so it is in an informal authority but it is not explicitly EU law. There were attempts to ratify the Charter as EU law in the initial Lisbon draft and there were more recent attempts however many EU states are hesitant to fully include the ECHR into the EU legal order.

ECJ does reference the ECHR a lot tho, however this is in specific contexts and still should not be construed as formal endorsement via precedent. An example is the frequent conflation of judicial Independance within the context of A19TEU, A267TEU with A47 ECHR. The ECHR is used as a guiding tool if anything but it is not used in a general capacity. 

I frequently see people misunderstanding the nature of the ECHR and it’s position vis a vis the EU as a whole. Any issues or criticisms directed at the ECHR are often attached to the EU despite the EU having absolutely nothing to do with the ECHR. 

The EU is again considering the ECHR as a legal authority. You can read more on this development below;

2233,"Freedom of speech fears have been raised after senior MSPs demanded all journalists in Scotland undergo compulsory training “on the role that the media play in fostering Islamophobia”.

The first public inquiry into bigotry north of the border found that racism against Muslims had increased and made recommendations to tackle the problem, including demanding for guidelines that apply to written reporting and “the use of visual imagery” are followed.

John McLellan, director of the Scottish Newspaper Society, said: “The report raises some grave issues and will need time to be properly considered. We take our responsibility to avoid prejudice very seriously, but we must ensure it continues to be tackled without either compromising freedom of expression or introducing statutory regulation of the press.”

The report, produced by Professor Peter Hopkins, of Newcastle University, calls for institutions such as the media and police to recruit from diverse communities. It was commissioned by Holyrood’s cross-party group on tackling Islamophobia, which is led by Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader.

The report found that verbal and physical assaults have intensified, especially on public transport, with more participants in Glasgow experiencing abuse. Participants said they were most commonly abused in the street.

Sarwar called for all parties in Scotland to adopt a “no-tolerance” approach to Islamophobia. “There are people who feel scared to leave their homes for fear of verbal or physical attack, and feel they are outsiders in their own country. This should shame us all,” he said.

Hopkins, who has been researching racism and Islamophobia in Scotland for 20 years, said: “The evidence submitted to this inquiry makes it clear that Scotland has serious issues to address.”

A Scottish government spokeswoman said: “We will carefully consider [the] inquiry’s recommendations. New hate crime laws ensure our police and courts will have the powers so those who would deliberately target others can be prosecuted.”",,/r/europe/comments/ok2sv9/msps_want_journalists_to_undergo_training_on/h5584q9/,quixotic_cynic,1626263820

No. Really not.

- Russia: russian revolution and subsequent civil war

- Germany: Revolution in the wake of WW1, several local civil wars, ultimately ending in a reactionary coup and the rise of fascism.

- Austria: Revolution in the wake of WW1, ultimately ending in civil war and fashism.

- Spain: attempt to overthrow monarchy temperorily successfull, ultimately leading to civil war, defeat if the republic and fashism lasting well into the 70s and a corrupt constitutional monarchy lasting until today.

- Brittain: revolution, civil war, ultimately ending in defeat and restoration of monarchy.

- Italy: Monarchy ended after the regime the monarch supported was completely and utterly defeated in WW2. 

List goes on and on and on. Monarchs didnt leave by themselves. People had to make them leave, with violence. The only reason some revolutions were initially less bloody (e.g. in germany) is that the balance of forces was entirely against the monarchy.
 The french revolution was simply more protacted because it was one if the first, at a time when essebtially everyone (even their temporary allies) stood against their revolutionary ideals.",,/r/europe/comments/ojwkgx/14_july_1789_the_fortress_of_the_bastille_in/h558spv/,Lev_Kovacs,1626264272

2300,"I see two reasons.

1) Common foe. There is no reason why deciding to leave the EU would worsen British feelings toward European countries. A negative attitude was a prerequisite for Brexit, not a result. That's not true the other way around. The EU wasn't given a voice in that years long internal process, but we watched it unfold. Every country unfairly blames problems on Brussels to some extent, but with Brexit it took a very different tone. Brussels felt much closer to me when I saw the incredible arrogance and disdain people like Nigel Farage showed toward EU institutions. Farage, Johnson, May, Gove, Rees-Mogg etc. were the faces associated with Brexit. The most EU positive was ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" May, and she was cut off for it. How do you think the EU should perceive the UK if that's what it sees? But without a EU voice present in the UK, there's no way for you or your countrymen to see that shift in attitude. So the Euros and polls like these are only pulling back the covers on something that's been brewing for years and that you were simply unaware of. It's not a development in itself.

2) Different cultures. ""We send the EU £350m a week"", remember that? Leaving aside the lie for a moment, obviously the idea of sending money to other countries was a significant driver in the Brexit vote. But here the UK is willing to offer financial aid. To me that doesn't make sense. Net EU funds recipients are poorer countries. They may not be experiencing a major crisis, but they are worse off than we are and can be supported very effectively and sustainably in the EU framework, while financial crisis aid at best offers only a temporary reprieve.

I believe the reason is a similar attitude as that in the US. Charity is viewed as admirable, handouts aren't. The gesture of providing help to friends in need is a more significant driver than in other cultures, where perhaps the more prevalent attitude might be that it's not my problem.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ojo14h/europe_how_willing_would_you_be_to_help_another/h54yrxk/,banana_liver,1626256346

2375,"&gt;And how many random people do we NOT know about.

This is not an argument 

&gt;How many contemporary Roman citizens in Italia will we never know anything about? The fact we have some doesn't prove the lack of records is abnormal. And Jesus didn't live in Italia. He lived in Judah and records there were much worse and more likely to have been destroyed. He was supposedly a carpenter's son and effectively a cult leader. Aside from census records at the time which are spotty there's pretty much nowhere he'd even be recorded.

None of this is any argument for the existence of a historical Jesus.  My example that we have some historic evidence of some common people from ancient times is not to make a claim that that should be expected for anybody in history, but to give an example of some people from which we have historic evidence....  To show you WHAT that is...  Historic evidence..    You know.  Evidence that somebody actually existed!   We don't have that for the mythological carpenter son turned cult leader, but we do have that  for Marcus Vecilius Verecundus who was a workshop owner (felt maker)  in Pompeii who sold clothing.  To give an example.  Once again, this does not mean that we expect to find such evidence for any person in history. Evidence is very rare.  

&gt;Flavious Josephus mentions him in relation to John the Baptist and John's death which is generally accepted as historically valid.

 Yes, but that passage could be used as evidence for the existence of John the Baptist  and doesn't mention any Jesus.  (I know Jesus / Christos  is mentioned in other passages but those are all under debate and non can be seen as a watertight case for the existence of Jesus 

&gt;That is a different statement than he didn't exist

Yes, but that's all the claim I make. I don;t have evidence that he absolutely did not exist, I am just saying that we don't have any good evidence that he did.  Did the Jesus as depicted  in the New testament exist?  My answer would be: No, because it's a religious myth full of impossibilities  and inconsistencies. Did some preacher guy exist on which the  myths are based? Yes, probably, or maybe more than ne guy and stories were merged.  We just don't know for sure. 

But we do know Lucius Iucundus Caecilius. We even know how he looked, because we found 2 busts in his house in Pompeii. He was a banker and had a wart on his chin.   On the second floor of his house he kept a chest with 153 wax tablets with financial transactions.  His father was Lucius Felix Caecilius, which indicates that he was born a slave ( Felix) and gained the status as a free man later in life.  He founded the bank.  This shows you could move up rather quickly on the social ladder, the financial transactions are rather detailed and show that the family was quite wealthy when Lucius junior took over.

2378,"Well, suicide in the Nordic countries is decreasing https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23293897/
For instance Finland is quite close to European average. 2019 13,4 /100 000 population. 

Main point is that in the numbers. Suicide, how bad it is, is still marginal problem. Let us compare this to, for example Portugal with 7,1/100 000. So Finland has (roughly) 6 deaths more. Bad right? But suicide isn't the only tragical death. Traffic deaths in Portugal are 5,6/100K and in Finland 3,8/100K. With the same rounding, Finland ""leads"" with 4 deaths. Then we'll take something really sad, infant mortality. Finland's rate is 1,59/1000 births. Portugal 3,1/1000 births. Each and every one of these cases spread sadness around them. The difference around tragic deaths are getting quite small. Let's say that every deadh affects on ten person (I know, a modest number). Then there would be roughly few dozen persons more mourning and propably quite sad. Out of 100 000 there are still 99 900+ who are undecided. In Finland that is the mass who are positive about their lives, loving low corruption and functional systems, loving nature, having access to education, financial and health security. If those 99 900+ estimate their happiness even a fraction more happier than people in Portugal, they will easily outweight the negative difference (not total, but the difference) between those countries.

At the end:
In much of the world, suicide is stigmatized and condemned for religious or cultural reasons. In some countries, suicidal behavior is a criminal offence punishable by law. Suicide is therefore often a secretive act surrounded by taboo, and may be unrecognized, misclassified or deliberately hidden in official records of death.

And then the whole conclusion of the piece is also not shocking: “south and eastern europe tend to be in favour of more financial aid in europe than the western countrys”, ofcourse they are. Its because the west pays more and the south and the east recieve more.

After that euroskepticism peaked. That was the time when EU came to the brink of collapse.

EU soft Power fucked up so much that Sheuble said he was wrong about Italy and Von Der Leyen publicly apologised to Greece. Greece Is a Tiny nation, but Italian economy Is an Undercover juggernaut, so we are still here. 

I think Germans (and Dutch too) still don't understand how crucial those actions were and how much they still reverberate today.
And even during covid, even when times were darkest german sponsorship to helping Italy was feeble and undertone not to lose shares in the polls.

To me apologizing was ok, I love Germany and the EU and what Is past Is past.
Not to most of Italians though. To them 10 years of neverending crisis are a sufficiente reason to say: ""why don't you help yourselves?

The media and our politicians are the ones happy to paint the image and it does indeed work, the daily mail is a very popular newspaper that keeps perpetuating a Us vs Them with EU even after leaving. 

Our Government turned down an offer for musicians to tour around Europe as well as Erasmus… those seem like pretty harsh cuts from the UK. 

The vaccines are a grey area too… the EU signed a contract ahead of the UK with AZ, they have facilities to produce as well and invested as the UK did in development for the vaccine. Either way, you didn’t have to follow either as Hungary showed, so it’s a bit of a moot point. I won’t be surprised when some time in the future we see some odd movements between AZ, Tories or some document comes out explaining AZ’s behaviour either. 

I didn’t say the EU was a bastion of Socialism, it isn’t and I said a lot of things Socialists care about were protected by the EU.

2514,"Exclusivity? A bit unsure what you are referring to here. What I can say is that oil and fish are exempt from the EFTA-agreement. Norwegian fishing, and especially fish-farms, are extremely competitive however. Too competitive at times, according to the EU.

As for petroleum: it’s argued that it doesn’t go within the scope of the EFTA-agreement either, as it isn’t technically within Norway’s borders. This has never been contested in court.

Norway’s riches from petroleum, however, comes a large part from heavy indiscriminate taxes on extraction of foreign and national companies. Smaller petroleum-related contracts, however, with certain origin demands, may have been in violation had they been included in the agreement. The role of Statoil perhaps as well (which I reckon is what you are referring to with exclusivity).


What Norway has traded for this, however, is sovereignty. They always talk about how the EU isn’t democratic enough, and it influences a lot. Norway is subject to the same influence, but without any say whatsoever in the decision-making process. When a directive is made in Brussels, Norway can just stand and watch, but must adopt it if the directive is created. 

Whether this lack of participation and influence is a fair trade for what we’ve gained, mostly protectionism on inefficient farmers (on a global scale), is a matter for much debate. More aspects can be drawn in to that discussion as well, like the need for a certain degree of self-sufficiency out of strategic reasons (the need of which was demonstrated by the start of Covid).",Norway,/r/europe/comments/oj89i6/european_union_territory_in_the_continent/h54j86a/,Gerf93,1626242395

2538,"&gt; obviously people in the UK likes European countries

So can we drop this bunk that the UK has took a dump on the EU or European countries because it voted to leave it?

&gt; roaming charges

Not really an issue. Data cap is 25gb and if your on holiday for 2 weeks your not going to go over that. Anyway, I’d say roaming charges are far down on my list of priorities. 

&gt; The media and our politicians are the ones happy to paint the image and it does indeed work

How much does it work though? Look at this poll. Look at similar polls. It’s always the EU countries who view the UK negatively not the other way about. This idea that the UK has took a dump on the EU stems down to voting to leave. Which clearly isn’t the case. 

&gt; Our Government turned down an offer for musicians to tour Europe as well as Erasmus

No objections there and there is nothing stopping future governments renegotiating on that. But to me personally, that doesn’t justify the UK’s membership to the EU. 

&gt; The vaccines are a grey area too

No it wasn’t. I’m not talking about not joining the EU Procurement Programme, I’m talking about the EU’s threats of blocking exports and downplaying the efficacy of the AZ jab. You can talk all you like about how we should have been exporting but we were clear from the start that we wouldn’t export until we vaccinated our population and (as you mentioned) all vaccines produced in the UK belonged to us so we wouldn’t be blocking anyones vaccines - the EU did. 

&gt; a lot of things socialist care about were protected by the EU 

And they’ll stay protected in the UK. We got told the sky would fall in when the UK voted to leave. It didn’t. Then we got told it would be in 2017. It didn’t. Then it would be 2018 and 2019, then it would be after we officially left. So far, with the disaster that was predicted has failed to materialise.

2568,And why is that? Why is it that UK military was pathetic despite Hitler being obvious threat for years? That aside. Your country signed off something called Munich Treaty without country that it was about. My country. Unlike your pathetic appeasment we built border defenses and fortresses and improved on military because our government back then was not retarded like yours. We also had modernized army unlike Poland. France had mutual defense pact with us. With your help Hitler could have been stopped right there because we had mountains and means to hold him off long enough for help to arive and defeat Hitler right away. And what you did you signed Munich Treaty with Germany. You have us ultimatum to give up territory with our built on defenses and on top of that you threatened us that if we dare to defend ourselves then we would be those who started war. USSR was willing to help back then (despite them occupying US later on). It would have been easy to defeat Hitler with this much force if you and France joined. Your pathetic cowardiness made Hitler what he was so do not you dare to defend appeasment. You were just pathetic and you still are because you do not even know the true history as it seems.

2620,"The Storming of the Bastille (Prise de la Bastille) occurred in Paris, France, on the afternoon of 14 July 1789. The medieval armory, fortress, and political prison known as the Bastille represented royal authority in the centre of Paris.

The Bastille was medieval fortress on the east side of Paris that became, in the 17th and 18th centuries, a French state prison and a place of detention for important persons charged with various offenses. 

The Bastille, stormed by an armed mob of Parisians in the opening days of the French Revolution, was a symbol of the despotism of the ruling Bourbon monarchy and held an important place in the ideology of the Revolution.

On the morning of July 14, 1789, when only seven prisoners were confined in the building, a crowd advanced on the Bastille with the intention of asking the prison governor, Bernard Jordan, marquis de Launay, to release the arms and munitions stored there. Angered by Launay’s evasiveness, the people stormed and captured the place; this dramatic action came to symbolize the end of the ancien régime. The Bastille was subsequently demolished by order of the Revolutionary government.

Bastille Day, celebrated annually on July 14, was chosen as a French national holiday in 1880.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/ojwkgx/14_july_1789_the_fortress_of_the_bastille_in/h54an9d/,filosoful,1626236214

2655,"As a Scot I completely agree, it’s ridiculous. If I tell an American or a European online that I am British they are often none too happy about it, but the moment I mention I’m Scottish the reaction completely reverses and are more than happy with me.

And yet our nation shares many problems with the rest of the UK and Europe - we smash things over dumb things like football, we have racists and sectarians and homophobes, we have unwarranted prejudices, and we always hope for the best for our football team even though deep down we know they will get trashed badly.

The rampant Anglophobia online is disgusting frankly, and I’m appalled at the many ways in which my fellow Scots work to propagate it. At school, at work, at the pub at the weekend, in many places I hear terrible things said about England and English people. I know people that were genuinely furious over England winning games at the Euros - people literally screaming and shouting because a completely different team was winning games. Remember that statistic about how domestic violence in England increases every time England losses a game? I would bet money that domestic violence in Scotland saw an increase for every game that England won. It’s pathetic.

At best people here try to justify it, we apparently hate how “cocky” England fans sound or how they are always banging on about the 1966 World Cup. Shit excuses, especially given the ridiculous optimism we had for Scotland in the Euros. Often though, we simply just hate the English - but of course that’s just a joke, we don’t *really* hate the English. I don’t doubt some people when they say this, but all too often this is just used to veil genuine hatred and recently this has become highly evident. We would raise eyebrows if somebody joked so much about hating Muslims, or Nigerians, or Italians, but it’s just England so obviously it’s ok.

Reading through Scottish Twitter and Facebook can sometimes be entertaining. Occasionally you’ll see people justifying their hatred of England through history. I really like history, I’m studying it at uni in fact, so I can usually easily pick up on some terrible takes. Generally, these nationalist “historians” work to portray Scotland as a poor subjugated nation that was brutally oppressed by the English, a colony if you will, and not the willing participant in the British Empire that it was. Even if half of what is said is true, it doesn’t justify hatred of an entire people.

I was and continue to be completely opposed to Brexit, but this elitist view taken by many Europeans and others that they are better than England is exactly part of why the message of Brexit appealed to so many. English people are acutely aware of what people in Europe often think of them, more so perhaps than younger progressive remain voters. This attitude is exactly part of why many English people don’t warm well to Europe.

This kind of nonsense is antithetical to the founding values of the EU, and the values of any respectable person who tries their best to suppress their prejudices, and yet here we are. It’s hard to support the EU when this is how people in your country are wrongly viewed by many within the EU, why should we look to integration in a union that doesn’t want to view us with any kind of respect or as an equal, rather just as the drunken idiot of the crew when really we have our affairs in order a lot better than most European countries. We’re prepared to do far more to protect Europe from armed aggression than most European states are for god’s sake.

I apologise as much as I can for my fellow countrymen’s role in spreading this disease, and hope for the best for England. I have family down in England and my own dad is English and god knows they don’t deserve this shit. I know somebody at work who is English, and I alone have been in the presence enough to hear people challenge them - a lone English person who hasn’t been to an England game in their life - over England fans.

2675,"\&gt;The real question is why do you care if people are allowed to treat their native language with the same importance as the language which was violently imposed upon them? Why do you care if a child is taught that Occitan, which their ancestors spoke for a thousand years, is treated with dignity?

I agree that it would be nice to do, but is it necessary. In a perfect world, it should be. But  neoliberal capitalism spread by the Anglo-Saxons puts pressure on people. Because I am bilingual and I know that languages can be weaponized to keep people down. I am happy to speak both languages and I would not cry if tomorrow someone told me that I had to just use one FOR WORK. I am suggesting that they can keep their oral dialect to chit chat with their friends and relatives. Accents can keep people down and the majority knows it, especially the racist types. Local idioms can too. Asking people to learn many languages before or alongside the official language of the establishment and the majority plays into the hand of that majority and that establishment who need weak and cheap labour that they can discriminate based on poor language skills (which they make a resume/job test criteria). It is all very subtle and the majorities do not get how some people use systems and languages to ostracize or discriminate. The Spanish-speakers who do not need to learn a patois have an advantage. These regions could separate, which they have tried to do. They might benefit or they might not. The systems (legal, electoral, economic,,...) are created to enrich the majority and the elite usually, assuming they must comply to the rules and laws that the minority must adhere to. AGAIN, I am not against regional languages (as languages), but to push the learning of the written part is not pragmatic in a neoliberal world.

\&gt;Somehow large regions in Spain are able to educate children primarily in their native tongue, while also teaching them fluent Spanish, and English or French as well.

That is true! Tell me something I don't know. They probably are, but  the devil is in the details which you are not going to give to make your argument stick. (I hate when people cannot have a debate, but maybe you just don't know the other side of the argument or are persuaded that your side is right.) Local dialect and Spanish are not that far off. Spanish and French are related linguistically, so it is easy to learn. Do not make it as if it is that it is that hard, but it takes more time to do. That is the point that you are not getting or do not want to. Learning French makes more sense than English geographically btw. Most children and adults would have access to French channels and can travel there. So, it is moot. You did not say they were fluent in French or English. It is easier to be fluent in French than English for Spanish-speakers. It is obvious that if you learn so many languages, you must neglect some other topics or subjects. I know. I am a teacher with 25 years of experience teaching 2 languages as native-languages in a country that offers this. Re-read the above argument until you get the main thesis. Do not reply if you cannot acknowledge that I have a good point at least. I am tired to explain something that is so elementary.   
Are you claiming that the French education system cannot match the results of Spain's?

Results of what? What part of the education system? PISA tests? It all depends what you measure. I am sure the analyses would be pages long. Just PISA evaluations on a few subjects are. 

Let's agree to disagree. You view this from a principle or moral angle. I view it from a pragmatic angle. I am not taking an extremist point of view like you though. I do not suggest all local dialects should be prohibited. I am just stating that learning formally the written part is not that important and might actually negatively impact the lives of people (especially the disadvantaged who are already at a disadvantage usually).",,/r/europe/comments/octzh3/macron_steps_up_his_war_on_identity_politics/h54f0bn/,PeterDmare,1626239198

2715,"&gt;Remember how the UK balked at the whole thing and worked on ""exemptions"" (doesnt sound familiar at all, does it).

That's a bit of a daft representation (although it does tie into this...) because of the way financial services are regulated banks already have to capitalised appropriately in every jurisdiction they operate, the local units of global banks already declare profits and pay tax in the countries where they are operating, and where their business take place.  This has been a fairly well accepted point in the discussions running up to the global agreement (that includes the exception by the way..).  The risk to the UK was firms paying less tax to the UK, on business carried out in the UK, and more tax outside of the UK where they were already paying an appropriate level of tax...

The counterpoint to that is that tech firms, that don't pay tax where they make their money, were being taxed by the UK (and latterly France and Italy) separately to deal with that discrepancy.  That's where this ties in, the US had wanted the UK, France, Italy etc..  to abolish their digital services taxes the moment the new global tax rules were agreed, something that the UK and the French were not particularly happy with (because of the potential lag between agreement and implementation among other things), so the agreement in the end was a staged removal of the digital services taxes, as the US implemented the global tax agreement..

So while the EU has put its plans on hold, you could argue that France, Italy and the UK were able to leverage their national approaches to ensure US compliance (it also gives the US something of a political win, even if it essentially re-levels the playing field..) and can hold that while the global package is approved, and it means that they can use that to ensure that pressure remains in place as the US implements, doubly so gien it'll require approval the 130+ countries that signed up to it too (so its not instant by any means).

This isn't a case of the UK having carved out some sort of sneaky opt-out for themselves, or taken a position that is unfair or unreasonable, but it does seem clear that at least some of the pressure on the US came from countries showing that they'd act even if there were no global agreement, in that context this is very much the EU not leading, and now having to follow France and Italy (in an EU context) and the UK (although I still don't wonder if the EU bringing in a bloc wide digital services tax, with the same phased approach to removing it if the global agreement does come in, wouldn't have been better all round).",Ulster,/r/europe/comments/ojatyd/eu_puts_its_digital_tax_on_hold_after_us_pressure/h53x62h/,marsman,1626228330

We have a global agreement at this point, but it isn't implemented, putting the EU's approach on hold seems like a mistake until it is actually in place. That is assuming that there isn't an internal EU barrier to that approach (which there might well be with Ireland, given Ireland has also decided it won't take part in the global initiative and so creates a potentially major issue given the way EU member states operate internally within the block in relation to taxes....).

While Lutheranism has not really evolved that much, the Reformed branch has spawned a lot of new movements, such as the **Presbyterians** or the **Baptists**. There's also **Anglicanism**, which famously started because Henry VIII wanted a marriage annulment and as such started as a bit of a separate movement, much more inherently political.

This is all extremely complicated and there are literal hundreds of denominations, but these are probably the most common ones. Evangelicanism, as I said, descends from Anglicanism and is tied to a general period called the ""Great Awakenings"", which arguably contributed to the ""intermeshing"" of religion and society as we have today in the US.

The moment that there is no longer a credible threat to our healthcare system, these otherwise unconstitutional restrictions must be lifted. Some restrictions (e.g. mask mandate in public transport) are not unconstitutional and can be kept even after the special legislation expires.

3089,"&gt;So no one should ever be outvoted?

Yes, we should negotiate first and gain support of all. We should never pull unthought decisions whiteout care for interest of other groups, because for those groups those decisions are then forced. That is reality of Bosnia, if it wants to function. Pulling moves supported by by only 1 (or 2) groups only lead to breakdown of state. 

&gt;We should all cast our votes carefully and deliberately so that it's 1/3 for everyone?

No, we should try to gain consensus for policies, not outvote each other.

&gt;What's the point of a referendum?

On national level in multicultural state like BiH, there is really no point of it, specially when it splits own population on ethnic lines. 

&gt;What's the point of expressing opinions?

There are better places to express one. 

&gt;Where's the Bosnian entity for the Bosniaks of Sandžak?

BiH is state of all three ethnic groups (Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats). Serbia is national state of Serbs (which is also committed to respecting rights of ethnic and national minorities). Completely different situations.

&gt;Aren't they getting outvoted too?

No, because they have guarantied minority rights by constitutions, which are according to what we know respected.

&gt;I'll tell you what I believe. If you have a minority in your country, and you repress them, try to wipe out their identity, in some cases, you murder and try to ethnically cleanse them, then they should get the right to split away to protect themselves, even if it means taking that country's land, because the country lost the moral authority to govern that area.

We can then say similar thing for Republica Srpska and Serbs in BiH, because in there eyes, Sarajevo lost all authority to represent and rule them.

&gt; if we tried to wipe out their identity,

Which members of your nation did try in the past and even try today whit so called ""orthodox Bosnians that forget there nationality"". 

&gt;Bosnia is the most multi-cultural EX-YU republic

While Bosnia is multicultural, Bosnian multiculturality does not function at all, as all three groups do not trust each other after centuries of on and off interethnic conflict and guest for domination over others.  

&gt;Bosniaks live in Sandžak, but they don't have their own entity in Serbia, are they in some sort of danger because of that?

Again, no, because there minority rights are largely respected. In Bosnia, rights of constitutive nationality where not respected.

I get that the Rafale C has the advantage in terms of thrust to weight and max speed as compared to the F-35A but the F-35A is superior in those aspects to the F/A-18E. And in maneuverability the Super Hornet is a 7.6g jet as opposed to a 9g capability of the Rafale C and F-35A. Though there are other aspects to intercept capabilities.

What other Union purported to be sharing the same values allows that to happen with nary a red face?

3151,"&gt;Internment and killing people isn't genocide. There was no plan of action on behalf of the British government to systematically destroy the Mau Mau as a people. You can't prove the intention. 

1st of all, there are no Mau-mau people that was the name of the rebellion
2nd the Kikuyu, Meru and Embu people were interned, killed and targeted for atrocities systematically based on their ethnicity and racial group. The British people had intent to destroy at least part of those people seeing as they were in active rebellion. To that end, they separated families and interned civilians.

Genocide.

Let's end this. You are just going to continue moving the goalposts and play semantical games with your definition of intent. If getting on a boat and sailing across the world to kill a large portion of an entire ethnic group doesn't show intent - then nothing will bar a British government memo saying genocide these boys - which if it did exist would have been destroyed by the government along with all the other evidence of British wrongdoings.

To a certain degree a myth... A relatively small part of the norwegian population work within food-industry (agruculture and likewise). So it gives no meaning that an industry few people work within should have that impact.. Norwegians spends billions each year buying food in sweden. 

Main reason for not joining eu is that economy is good because of the incomes from the  petroleumssector. Sales of oil, gas etc are not a part of the eu-deals.. You see it well if you disect the numbers.. Norways biggest trading partner is EU.. But within the EU it is germany.. [Norway](https://tradingeconomics.com/norway/exports/germany)sell oil, gas etc for 6.2 billion to germany.. Fish amounts to 376 millions.. Norways income from oil is 17 times that of fish if you take over biggest trading partner.. 

If norway was like sweden (with no oil) , they had probably been member of eu today... Remember that back in 1994 when norway voted no to eu.. the revenues from oil industry was not that big (like it is today) ..

3180,"For more detail:

- Protestantism is the general umbrella for Christian practices that stem from the Reformation, the period that started with the whole ""Martin Luther nailing his 1-star review of the papacy on the door"". That's roughly 1520 AD.
- Evangelicalism is a subset of Protestantism that appeared in the 1700s, and is itself an off-shoot of Methodists, themselves borne out of the Anglican church. I can't spell out all the differences between ""OG Lutherans"" and Evangelicals, but there are two main ideas that Evangelicals espouse: 1) you should go and spread the Good Word, and 2) acts of charity and similar actions are what can bring you salvation. It became particularly popular in America because its message of ""go and do good work and you'll get rewarded"" jigsawed pretty well with the Lockian concepts the US were founded on.

It's made more complicated by the fact that Martin Luther himself used the term ""evangelische Kirche"" (evangelical church) to refer to his brand of Chrtistianity, and nowadays in Europe a lot of Lutheran or Reformed movements do have ""evangelical"" in the name.

This might seem like a small nitpick but both ""factions"" have very different takes on society. For instance, according to a French poll:




I'm cool with... | Lutherans | Evangelicals
---|---|----
Abortion | 87% | 40%
Blessing civil union couples | 58% | 32%
Blessing same-sex couples | 46% | 14%
Euthanasia | 62% | 27%

Furthermore, most modern ""American-style"" preaching, megachurches and the likes come from Evangelicalism and many non-evangelical Protestants don't vibe with that.

TL;DR: The term ""protestantism"" includes a *lot* of different belief systems, and the modern English term ""evangelicalism"" is only a subset of them. In that graph, yellow is certainly protestantism.",Lorraine (France),/r/europe/comments/ojdt3l/followers_of_the_main_religions_in_the_biggest/h5290gt/,Calembreloque,1626199292

3208,"The article goes quite in depth, even listing all the alternative routes that were considered. A very very brief overview is this

&gt;The waterway would offer a much faster and lower-cost route for cargo destined for Europe from the East.

&gt;Development of the new waterway would offer a transportation link from the East Mediterranean directly to the heart of Europe, via the Axios/Vardar, Morava and Danube rivers.

&gt;Cargo would no longer need to be shipped all the way to Gibraltar and from there up to the Netherlands, or be held up in the narrow Bosporus strait.

&gt;Some early studies have indicated that such a route would work out to be three-and-a-half days faster compared to the existing option via Rotterdam.

&gt;At a speed of 10 km an hour, cargo vessels from China need eight days to reach their European destination. Using the canals, it would take a little over four hours.

&gt;China’s canal trade route through Europe is not only far more cost efficient, it is also environmentally safer as well.

&gt;Fuel costs for the number of trucks, trains and/or planes required to carry the goods across Europe will be slashed considerably, let alone that pollution will be limited.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/ojh9dh/chinas_extravagant_plan_for_canal_trade_route/h51ri0j/,Dimboi,1626191591

I think education of younger generations is the key thing to change that mindset, elementary is obligatory and all of Roma kids finish it but they mostly don't continue education, although in recent years several non-gov org (but paid through gov projects) work hard on providing better conditions for them to continue education after elementary school. They have quotas in gov institutions and companies to hire Roma peoole, same for University where they have guaranteed free tuition.

For example in my hometown (Gornji Milanovac) where we had gypsy slum city 15 years ago its now past,every family got their home and are integrated fully into community, since local gov didn't just give them homes and funding but also monitored for years after, and helped them find a job and keep kids in school.

3253,"&gt; Imo badunitedkingdom are the exact same as the spastic Irish redditors with Chips on their shoulders.

It's definitely not a consistent subreddit. Generally it trends conservative, but that ranges from centre-right to far far right. Most of the posts on that sub draw attention to comments across Reddit which most rational people would agree are insane. So for example if we look at the top posts this month, they are (A) about thousands of people on Reddit pretending Italian fans are saints and English fans are evil, (B) Oxfam saying that reporting rape harms black and marginalised people, and (C) Someone on Twitter mocking GB News (despite the fact that this person applied, and was turned down for, a presenting role). 

None of these are unreasonable things to make fun off. And it makes sense to have a /r/shitamericanssay style sub about Reddit's general anti-British leanings. But when you look in the comments, there are always one or two people who are clearly much more extreme than average. 

However I do think that overall /r/badunitedkingdom gets more shit than it deserves. People talk about it like some hive of scum and villainy, when in reality it's not that bad.

I too am not happy that Westminster had to legislate on the above issues but that only happened due to DUP abuse of the 'Petition of Concern', which is a proviso (and one of the major inherent flaws) of the Good Friday Agreement. Which was negotiated by... the British and Irish governments. In both cases the public overwhelmingly supported the law being changed by roughly 70 odd per cent off the top of my head, but a loophole allowed the most reactionary party (who, remember, in a coalition govt reflect less than a third of the vote share) to block it

You can say ""whatever the sordid history"" as if it shouldn't have a bearing on things and in an ideal world maybe it wouldn't but the fact is that it's *all* connected

For what it's worth I dont entirely agree with the poster above that Conservative voters (who I'm loath to let off the hook for anything) are directly responsible for bonfires not being properly policed given that the party only remembered the 'Unionist' bit of their name when it suited them, but their broader point is a valid one; for as long as part of Ireland remains in the UK, politicans, the media, and yes, voters in GB cant really play the ""devolution means it's not our problem any more"" card - especially if they're embarrassed or appalled by things like bonfires

3314,"&gt; Haha, thats not what you said at the start. Its nice you're learning boy, good for you.

Yes, that's what I said. Every NATO member should spend %2 of it's GDP to military. Only 8/29 did it until Trump came out and span whole European nations in front of the world. Why did 21/29 not pay %2 of it's GDP for 40 years? You must obey to the agreement.

Then you said do you trust Trump? I showed you from German sources confirming Trump, now you look like a fool. Was Trump right or not? Do you still have a doubt?

&gt; Oh well, you still dont get it. :D your military budget is not NATOs budget dude. You spend more on military bases in pacific, which has nothing to do with NATO, than to bases in Germany. 

NATO have a budget, meaning, all member NATO countries spending military = NATO budget. Our spending makes %71 of NATO budget. Rest are what other countries are paying. How thick your skull, bro? You still didn't get it?

Why are we having our soldiers in your country and you don't have any soldiers in our country? Who's protecting who? Are Lithuanian soldiers protecting USA from Canada or are American soldiers protecting Lithuania from Russia?

&gt; We are paying the 2% for quite a while now. And even before Trump. But its ok, I know its hard for you to know so much as an american. 

Yes, Lithuania does because Lithuania is our puppet. They have to do what we tell them to do. This is why I said, only 8/29 countries have been keeping their word. 21/29 didn't but oh well, you can't read LOL

&gt; Learn the term buffer zone. You need us more than you think you do. We wouldnt be in NATO if it wouldnt be like that.

Hahahahahahaha. We need Lithuania, yes sure. USSR existed and invaded your country for roughly 50 years. Buffer zone was Berlin. What happened? We beat USSR in Cold War anyway. Who cares if buffer zone is Lithuania? If USSR take you again, we can make Poland as a buffer zone. If Poland doesn't exist, we can make Berlin as a buffer-zone. Who changes? Nothing much. We beat USSR once, we can beat them again.

If we cared about buffer-zone that much, we would have included Ukraine in NATO long time ago since Ukraine is way more powerful country than tiny Lithuania LOL. Looks like Daddy America don't give a shit about buffer-zone, that much.

But I like the idea of Lithuania of being buffer-zone, that means, if war break out, highest casualties will be from Baltic states, since they're being the bait.

&gt; As I told, we spend 2% for defense for years now. And we are increasing that above it to 2.5%. And not because birdbrain trump thought its a payment to nato directly, like you did here too. Its because we understand why we should invest into our own defense. 

Good job. Listen to Daddy America all the time. When we tell you to do something, you must do it or you'll face the consequences. Do you want to eat sashlik and borsch all your life? I don't think so. You better listen to us or we'll push you right back to Russian arms. By the way, what's Lithuania's GDP anyway? According to 2019, it's $54 billions. 

You pay %2 of $54 billions. LOL. You can't even beat 2 F-35 from us with that budget, man. hahahahahaha. It just means $1 billion LOL. I think you should pay %40 of your GDP to military. 

New Jersey is one of the smallest state we have in US. New Jersey's GDP is $535 billions in 2019, which means, almost 10x more than whole Lithuania LMAO. I 

&gt; Russia couldnt even do anything to Georgia for days. You overestimate their IQ to attack something. We would be fine up to time NATO reinforcements arrive, I'm sure.

If that doesn't help to divide and alienate an already minority nationalist population in these towns, I don't know what will.




Then there's other smaller things that just increase spitefulness. I'm not sure how familiar you are with NI politics but in June 2020 a large proportion of Sinn Fein (the nationalist government in NI) including the Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill attended the funeral of Bobby Storey, who was the head of intelligence for the IRA with a string of violent accusations against him. Of course, honouring an ex-IRA man generally tends to rile up unionists, but since this was also in the height of lockdown restrictions when the public weren't allowed to go to funerals, this was quite the scandal. As you probably rightly assume, the lads out lighting effigies and flags on bonfires don't care about lockdown restrictions, but here both sides will latch onto any accusations they can to slander the other side.





I personally believe the whole funeral thing was a big contributer to why this year is a bit more aggressive than others, but it's also fueled by unionist uncertainty because the leader of the DUP (major unionist party of NI) and First Minister resigned, along with general uncertainty about Brexit and the pandemic. These lads have spitefulness and hatred drilled into them through their entire upbringing, and as the adults are getting more cynical and alienated from the predictability of their everyday lives, this is just getting more and more aggressive right from home and among young, impressionable, angry, typically poor teenagers.",Northern Ireland,/r/europe/comments/oj2dt6/irish_flag_flies_in_the_flames_during_the_uks/h50zs3n/,Pedro95,1626177309

Also, if you look at people in positions of power, I think I see WAY more minorities in positions of power in the UK and in the US. Just saying. Whereas in Germany, I rarely see women in certain positions, not to mention minorities.

The UK is likely the least racist country in Europe, or at least one of them. Every study I've ever seen on the matter shows the UK has some of the lowest instances of racial abuse and some of the highest acceptance of things like interracial marriage.

I voted to remain but I fail to see how Brexit has anything much to do with racism. While in the EU, Europeans, who are mostly white, had privileged access to migrating to the UK.

3906,"&gt; You have a nerve. The UK will take no lessons on racism from a country like Hungary.


Oh this aged very well, especially what happened 20 hours ago. Whole world saw what a racist country England is. Sending over 550,000 monkey emoji's and gorilla emoji's to 3 black English players to the point, whole world saw it. Even Rashford realizes what a racist country he has to live in. 

So, you wanna ask the world especially after last night's incident, which country is way more racist? UK or Hungary? I bet, no black player or anybody black in Hungary was racially abused 550,000 times by gorilla and monkey emoji's in one night. Only happens in England.

What do you expect from a country that started slavery in Africa? Of course, England are very racist nation. Everyone knew that and last night just confirmed, by sending half million monkey emoji's to 3 innocent black players. I think you shouldn't talk about racism at all. You're the last nation on Earth to talk about racism.

Hungary never racially abused black person 550,000 times in one night, only England could have done that and did that. Hungary never invaded even one African country and sell them as slaves. England did way more than 20 African countries. Look at your racisy, bloody, dirty history and shame on you.

&gt; It happens everywhere. Even in the Netherlands. I have been all over Spain, and you are so wrong about it, it's laughable. Every survey has Spain high up in the rankings of gay acceptance and friendliness

Should I believe to you or should I believe to 55,000 Spanish people protesting about gay rights on last Friday saying LGBT members have no freedom in Spain? I think my answer is obvious. I trust Spanish people about Spain, not you Brit. According to you, there's no racism in UK too. That's not what WORLD SAW last night.

&gt; Funnily enough, I didn't stop people in the street to ask about their views on homosexuality. In any case, if the majority support repression of a minority then it is a matter of national shame, not pride. I couldn't give a fuck if it's 100%.

That's how polls work, if you didn't notice. You don't need to be Einstein to understand that majority of the people in Sweden-Norway-Netherlands are PRO-LGBT and countries are like, Bulgaria-Romania-Spain-Portugal-Italy-Romania-Hungary-Czech Republic-Slovakia-Ukraine-Belarus-Russia-Lithuania-Latvia-Lithuania are ANTI-LGBT. Do you need to talk to everyone in the country to come up with that conclusion? I don't think so. 

&gt; I'm not talking about that reptile Orban

Oh I knew it. Dude believes into reptiles, acting like humans. He's conspiracy theorist hahahahahahaha. There are rumours that your Queen is shape-shifting reptile too, you know that right? LOL.  

&gt; No matter how much you try to repress, it has absolutely no effect on the number of gay people

Then, why are you moaning about Hungary and Orban? This law shouldn't bother you at all, since you think ""no matter how much you try to repress it, it has absolutely no effect."" Hahahahahaha. Why are you moaning so much? Don't mind the law that Hungary passed then? What you're saying and what you are doing two totally different things.

&gt; Firstly, let's see the evidence. We all know it's the minority of the planet which is progressive, civilised, affluent. I am very privileged to be born and bred in the minority.

It was posted on WorldNews subreddit last week. I think I can find out from there again the link. Only %13 of the world, gays feel comfortable and it's only in few countries. Majority of the world, %87 of the world, gays don't feel comfortable or there's no laws to protect them. If you look at it on the paper, Turkey legalized being gay almost 100 years ago but go ask a gay person in Turkey, if he feels safe or if there are any laws to protect him. Not really, law is on the paper only.

&gt; Ah, so it's a ""problem"" is it? 

it's not your problem, remember Brexit? That's why, it's not your problem. You don't have a vote in EU, therefore, there's nothing you can do other than moaning on Twitter and Reddit. I'm sure, Orban doesn't really go to Reddit to read what ""VelarTAG"" has to say about Hungary LOL. Instead of spending your energy where you don't know their traditions, their language or have a vote, you might as well spend your energy on your racist country, so 3 black players wouldn't get abused by half million comments based on their skin color.

Why don't you be useful and work on that and leave Hungarians to deal with their domestic problems? You're yet to solve your own domestic racist problems in UK yourself.

That flag being burned by that group is representative of more than some cloth going ablaze - as it is with all flags representing a nation and its people.

Those bonfires burn the Irish flag, photographs of politicians, photographs of the pope, flags belonging to other countries(a lot of Palestine flags). In my local area, a local political representative was celebrating his 21st birthday while his photograph was burning on a bonfire. That is not culture. 

Year after year the same people burning these bonfires, these flags, these symbolisms - they are the same people who want so desperately for Northern Ireland to identify with the rest of the UK, so much so that the unionist politicians bend the knee to any British political party that promises to benefit them.

3964,"Because of timing...

1. Those people I mentioned have already been fully immunized with 2 doses a while now. Romania opened for general population in the middle of march while other countries were stockpiling still and going to finish their second act. Basically this means that most countries have just vaccinated their younger population despite having high rates right now. A month ago when most of western countries saw influxes of cases or tourists the percentages of young people fully vaccinated in them (and a week or two past for full immunity) were lower allowing the Delta variant to grow and probably infected hosts to travel between countries.
2. From the very start countries in Eastern Europe had different period of time for their waves that didn't match the western countries, mostly a bit delayed then western countries that generally have higher influxes of population and more crowded areas.
3. Because of the way we gave out vaccines even our international truckers, bus drivers, etc.. were vaccinated sooner. Most people that went out of the country vaccinated because it was easier and safer (so they don't risk two weeks quarantine when they get back). Hell, it's been two months now since anyone can get a vaccine regardless if he's a tourist or not as long he has any EU residency. And from the outside we maintain our own list of who gets to be quarantined or isolated and who's not.

So we're not models to follow and I'm very afraid that when the Delta variant eventually gets here we'll be highly fucked but, by dumb luck no one could have predicted, we've made it so not many infected hosts can enter the country despite not conducting PCR checks on the border.

P.S. This is just my personal opinion and most of what I'm saying would be difficult to prove academically (and a waste of time), but it just makes sense that we don't have cases because of what we did differently...",Europe,/r/europe/comments/oiq3fo/bulgaria_has_only_16_new_cases_todaytest_positive/h4zu2be/,SmokeyCosmin,1626144366

The Eurofighters were initial thought of in the 70's. The F35 is new, the Rafale and Eurofighter are the last of a great generation. 
 
The smaller the plane, the more manoeuvrable it is if the same money is spent on them. FCAS will be a bigger plane, tempest will be a smaller one.

Tempest will designed  as a air-superiority fighter as it's first role, FCAS as a multi-role.  

FCAS will be strengthened for carrier landings, strengthened for nuclear armaments, tempest does not need this. The other option is to spend more money on design for a separate variant for carrier based designs, this increases the cost. 
 
A multi-role will never be as capable as a dedicated superiority fighter, unless extreme amounts of money is spent on it. So unless FCAS is going to be a money pit, it will be a better multi-role than tempest, but a lesser air-superiority fighter than tempest.

4061,"To be fair, the modern world makes it pretty hard for native English speakers to learn a foreign language.  Most of the internet is in English, and there's so much English-language media compared to other language media. And when you go overseas to immerse yourself in the language, everybody you meet will complement your language skills before immediately switching to English 'to be welcoming' or 'because I want to practice my English' so you don't actually get as many benefits of immersion as you'd hoped. (Funnily enough the only ways around this that I've found are to head somewhere hopelessly rural where most of the population is extremely old or to have already polished your speaking skills up to a level where you can speak fairly fluently with minimal accent.)


There's also just not so much of a need to learn foreign languages for English speakers.  People with other native tongues have more motivation to learn English (useful for travel, global language of business, a lot of media and academic content is only available in English (or there's a lot more of it available in English)) and resources for learning English are everywhere, so people with no particular interest in learning a foreign language will often learn at least some English on the way to accomplishing one goal or another. Native English speakers who learn foreign languages are normally doing it out of personal interest rather than need, so there's a lot less of us.


But that's a lot of words to say: yeah, the stereotype is true. English-speaking people generally don't learn foreign languages to any useful level.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ois4v4/all_people_applying_for_welsh_goverment_jobs_will/h4zdvvb/,himit,1626135784

4072,"The EU economy will experience its fastest growth for decades this year according to the European Commission, which has boosted its forecasts for this year and next as the relaxation of pandemic-related restrictions fuels a rebound in activity.  

Growth across the EU will expand by 4.8 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent next year, Brussels said on Wednesday. That would be the most rapid expansion seen since 1976, although back then the bloc contained far fewer nations.“The EU economy is set to see its fastest growth in decades this year, fuelled by strong demand both at home and globally and a swifter-than-expected reopening of services sectors since the spring,” said Paolo Gentiloni, the bloc’s economics commissioner.The EU economy was hit by a 6 per cent contraction last year — the worst since it was formed.Germany will log growth of 3.6 per cent this year, while France will expand by 6 per cent and Italy by 5 per cent, the Commission forecast. Romania is tipped to chalk up the most rapid expansion, at 7.4 per cent.

The euro area’s gross domestic product will also expand by 4.8 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 2022, compared with previous forecasts of 4.3 per cent and 4.4 per cent.  

That would take real GDP back to its pre-crisis level in the final quarter of this year — sooner than the Commission had predicted as recently as this spring.The improving outlook is being fuelled by rapid progress with vaccinations, which has enabled many European countries to ease restrictions, boosting service businesses in particular. Tourist travel within the EU is also beginning to revive, aiding consumer spending.More than 62 per cent of the adult population in the EU and European Economic Area have received at least one vaccine dose.However Gentiloni warned that it was “essential” for member states to “maintain policy support as long as needed” in order to “keep the recovery on track”.“We must redouble our vaccination efforts, building on the impressive progress made in recent months; the spread of the Delta variant is a stark reminder that we have not yet emerged from the shadow of the pandemic,” he said.The rapid expansion, coupled with rising energy prices and production bottlenecks, will push consumer prices up this year, the commission said. Euro area inflation is expected to average 1.9 per cent this year, but it predicted the pressures would moderate in 2022, bringing the rate back down to 1.4 per cent.",,/r/europe/comments/oj47a1/eu_recovery_boosted_by_fastest_growth_in_decades/h4ze8zq/,Winstonoceaniasmith,1626135972

Says who? So you believe the Russian made census and the propaganda that they all like the Russian occupation? How free are the people to think for themselves when they have guns pointed at their heads? Can you be less naive? Do you also believe the Crimean census about joining back Russia with 90+% voting yes?

&gt; The Dacian empire (which many Romanians identify with), used the Nistru river as an Eastern border

We don't know that for sure.

&gt; And they will likely not even bother to speak Romanian to Romanians since they hate them so much.

Again, Russian propaganda. You can spit that somewhere else.

&gt; Not to mention the land there is trash. Like what production do they have? Steel, counterfeit money and textiles? I can't think of any other good use of their land.

That's very shallow and immature thinking. They have electricity and all the industry from Moldova was moved there during the Soviet times, so some industry is still left. Also you could say the same for example about other areas of Romania that don't have much industry going on, like Vaslui, Botosani, or most of the South from Oltenia and Muntenia. Why are they even in Romania, according to your logic?

4105,"&gt;You don't see Londoners bitch and moaning (well maybe you do actually).

Is the United Kingdom one country or two with an additional two appendixes? And does its government treat the whole country as one, or does it prefer to cater to... say... England... while ignoring Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland?

Yes, the last question was a leading one, but more importantly, the current government is probably a great one for a majority of the English. At least if a great one is one which caters to its immediate needs of feeling like a ""global"" power again, while ignoring the lessons learned from the early stages of a post-manufacturing or heavily-automated future.

But the big question will be if there will continue to be a United Kingdom, or if it will be reduced to Wangland costisting of Wales and England. Does the people of Northern Ireland really feel as a part of the U.K. after a Brexit which became much harder than any Leave campaigner proposed during the referendum? And being dragged out of EU on the votes of England, does it invalidate the first IndyRef since the main Remain argument was to that it was the only way to remain within the EU?

I'm intentionally asking the difficult questions, as to show that an unequal union will always remain unequal and create tensions. But more so, English nationalists pushing for the hardest of Brexit on some dream about the old times will always be English nationalists. Reacting with anger when EU takes backs control of its border, while expecting to be able to take back control of U.K.'s border, is one example. Ignoring the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland because it doesn't suit the British government, while at the same time giving yourself the right to trample on the sovereignty of 27 individual countries, is nothing outside pure disdain for those countries. But British exceptionalism, right?

It goes into the exact same pattern as all the other verbal attacks from the British administration against the EU, the EU27 and the citizens of the EU27. It caters to a group of English nationalists who need an ever more extreme view of... Brexit Britain... while tearing apart the foundations of society. But who cares, right?

4235,"And finally…

The point you have missed is that you’re inferring and assigning political viewpoint based on apolitical issues - issues that aren’t political in nature but have been politicised by those with an agenda (both on the right and on the left).

Therefore calling me right-wing without knowing my political views is ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is you calling me right-wing simply because I explained how there are no barriers to trans care and rights in the UK, how the GRC issue is a red herring, and that transition can easily be started without being on the GIC pathway.

Not everybody on the left agrees with each other and not everybody on the right agrees with each other therefore assuming political allegiance on a few points is ridiculous.

More accurate signs of political compass are opinions on the traditional political issues of taxation, foreign policy, militarisation, big v small government, public spending, the judicial (and rehabilitation) system, privatisation v nationalisation, access to healthcare, capitalism v socialism v social democracy. 

But you haven’t bothered to enquire about those. Instead you have chosen to label me as transphobic, hateful, narcissistic, cruel, racist, bigoted etc because I disagreed with you and said there aren’t barriers to trans care and rights in the UK. Because I pointed out the various, immediate options to transition (socially and medically). Because I called out those who moan that their lives are a misery in having to wait years to transition for free when they could easily attain their heaven simply by cutting back on a few token luxuries. When people complain they can’t afford transition themselves, whilst splashing £100+ every Saturday night out and buying the latest designer gadgets and smartphones, it’s not heartless to point out their hypocrisy.",,/r/europe/comments/ohzgnc/poll_in_denmark_on_who_they_want_to_win_the_uefa/h4yhczr/,SixGunsLoaded,1626119914

&gt;The US had initially wanted the UK, France, Italy and other countries with digital taxes to abolish them the moment the new global tax rules were agreed, but this faced strong opposition from London and Paris.

&gt;One ally of Sunak said: “That’s a bit like handing over the keys to your car before you’ve got the cash.”

&gt;But UK officials recognised there would need to be a staggered process, with countries with digital taxes taking a series of steps to remove them, while the US at the same time makes moves to implement the new global tax system.

All kinds of people are being hospitalized including vaccinated people.

There is a message passing around, and IMO it is a very american one of ""personal responsability"", that vaccine gives you 100% invulnerability. It does not sadly, and even if these rates there are still a lot who can not be vaccinated yet (under 25 year olds in Portugal get not a booking yet!).

&gt;restrictions shouldn't be kept in place to protect anti-vaxxers.

Another important point, NOT EVERYBODY can be vaccinated. It is not like not being vaccinated is being an anti-vaxxer. Babies and childre, transplantees, a number of others as well. And let us go back to the vaccines do not 100% protect all who have been vaccinated. We need to decrease the number of virus circulating, decrease its r, in order to protect everybody.

&gt;If the vaccine isn't enough to remove restrictions

Not at these levels it is not! We might need as much as 80% of the total population. For measles we kind of need 93% or more to guarantee no outbreaks - but measles is specially, notoriously contagious.

4448,"&gt;Strawman. Nuclear energy is not a magical solution. 

Then why do you require a magical solution to replace it?

&gt;It is merely the most environmental solution we have for the coming decades, 

Again, it's only ""environmental"" if you brush the nuclear problems under the rug. It's fine to disagree, it's not fine to pretend everyone who disagrees with you is a lunatic.

&gt;because the technologies to replace it are not ready yet.

They very much are, with other tradeoffs than nuclear of course. In many ways there are superior to nuclear power.

&gt;And your flexible is what exactly? Oh right: polluting gas plants. Great solution! /s

First, nuclear plants also requires gas plants for support. In Belgium nuclear power never did better than 66% of electricity supply, with 33% being provided by gas and coal plants.

Second, there are many more ways to increase the flexibility of the grid than on the supply side. One of the failures of the conventional energy policy is that they refused to address that.

&gt;Have you ever investigated the massive pollution caused by solar panel fabrication? I advise you do so, it'll be enlightening.

That's a function of the environmental legislation in the fabricating countries, not a necessity for its production. But of course, if you're going to bring that up, do realize that nuclear plants not only also require a bunch of exotic metals, they're once through and can't even potentially be recycled.

And finally, if you think that producing electronics is problematic, then the real elephant in the room is that we should limit the use of electronics. That will solve the electricity production problem too, of course.

&gt;Because we do not need new plants. Our existing ones can last for decades more while we develop and deploy renewable alternatives and work on better energy storage.

No, if we prolong the existing plants, nothing will happen, because the existing plants compete everything away. Their existence puts a damper on the investments. We've seen that in the past 17 years. You wanted to delay it to better develop renewables and storage? *You got your wish*. Now move over, time to do something.

&gt;The mess was created by the Greens, nobody else. Not just in forcing the initial decision for the kernuitstap

Everyone else had 17 years to deploy whatever magical alternative policy you think is available. They didn't, or couldn't. Moreover, the initial decision for the nuclear exit intentionally and deliberately provided ample time to prepate and organize it, because it was recognized this would not 

&gt; but also in decades of poisoning public opinion with their scaremongering and propaganda which made reversing that kernuitstap political suicide.

Why doesn't everyone just realize that you are right and they are wrong, wouldn't that make everything so much easier? /s
Do you realize how pathetic it sounds to paint everyone who disagrees with you as brainwashed?

&gt;We've been storing nuclear waste for decades now with probably less environmental impact combiend than a single year of a single Chinese solar panel factory.

Too bad we need to do so for centuries, not decades. And given the fact that we already have seen at least one storage solution being fucked up and in need for replacement, why should I trust your word on that? Everyone who profits of nuclear energy now will be dead by then, leaving everyone else to pick up the bill and suffer the consequences. That is just ethically not acceptable.

&gt;probably 

This says everything, you don't care about the effects or the risks, just the plausible deniability.

&gt;Are they or are they not building gas plants right now? 

What is decided right now is that there will be an auction of the reserve capacity in autumn, which will allow to decide on the production for the coming few years. Then there will be another auction for the next decade.

While it is expected that some gas will be part of that capacity (that was already virtually inevitable in 2016), expectations are already reduced from 7-8 gas plants to 1-2 gas plants.

So no, no gas plants are being built right now. You're confusing alarmist worst case scenarios with actual policy.

&gt;The reason these Greens are idiots and a danger to the environment is not because they want to replace nuclear power, it's because they want to do so before a viable alternative is ready and so have to rely on polluting gas plants in the mean time.

Last time they trusted their successors to have a reasonable energy policy, it just resulted in 17 years of postponing decisions and a total lack of preparation for either renewables or even new nuclear plants. So, if you want something done, you have to do it yourself.

&gt;I'm placing the blame squarely on those who caused this scenario.

Then you should place it on the ones who had the responsbility to prepare either the nuclear exit or commit to an alternative, but who failed to do so.

&gt;Besides, they also had 17 years to prepare and never got further than empty buzzwords and gas plants.
&gt;Not once has either Green party set out a policy in their party program on how to prevent this situation.
&gt;In fact, without 17 years of other parties recognizing reality we would have had 17 more years of ""Green"" pollution.

The inital nuclear exit provided a decade of preparation. 

Real policy involves actual work, not wishful thinking like ""just pretend the nuclear plants can be extended indefinitely for free!"". If you want cutting edge solutions and real innovation you can't just write a program in 2000 and pretend nothing will change in 20 years.

It's funny, you manage the blame the Greens for policy during a time they weren't in any government coalition, and not even in parliament for a time during that. If it still needed to be made clear you're just looking for a scapegoat rather than a solution, here it is.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/oin5rg/belgium_the_worlds_most_successful_failed_state/h4xktha/,silverionmox,1626105709

You group people into identities of your own making, completely disregarding the wishes of Indigenous people in order to better order your empire and personal world view.

4548,"&gt; But marking nuclear power as ""sustainable"" will impede that process, without helping us get out of fossils.

What makes you say that?     
Nuclear is so far (beside major hydro like Iceland or Norway) the only way a counry has reached 50g/kWh. All those who tried ended up with higher values. Sure, some coal has been closed, but nat gas is still having a great time and will be happy to oblige when renewable plateau at 30% of the generated power (the media will of course insist that they make up 80% of installed capacity, and nobody will point out the nuance).   


The ""processess"" that is surely ""impeded"" is the mental realisation that we need to make compromise. Selling wind/solar is only making people complacent with regards to their comsuption: ""no need to refrain from consuming if my power comes from the greenest of techs anyway"".    

Physics teaches us that in a finite words anthing the continuously grow isn't sustainable.      
In a magical dream world, when you tell people they have access to a cheap and clean energy they'll say ""sure, but I'll only use as little as possible"".     

If Greenpeace and the like change their tune tomorrow from ""100% renawable is possible"" to ""we redone all the math, if we dont divide our consumption by 3 in 10 years we will have no.other.choice but to rely on dirty scary dangerous nuclear"", not only will coal be gone by then, maybe we'd have reluctantly some NPP being built, but we'd finally be on a sustainable trajectory.",,/r/europe/comments/oip3m8/meps_call_on_european_commission_to_recognize/h4x5rfz/,233C,1626098355

Gaugazia is a tiny state that has a population that is no bigger than 150 000 people. It's the size of a medium-small sized Romanian town like Botosani or something.

Additionally, they'd be landlocked if they declared independence or autonomy. I \*really\* doubt Ukraine (with whom they share a small border) would do anything to support an independent or autonomous Gaugauzia.

4893,"No offense, but I imagine you don't know too much about us.  Healthcare is not just for the wealthy, that is an idea that weirdly persists among Europeans.  My mom was a muddle class woman, and her insurance paid for her to have aneurysm surgery at Mayo clinic with the number three neurosurgeon in the world.  It was well over a million dollars all totaled, and we were required to pay the 5,000 out of pocket.  I have the same blue cross blue shield insurance, and I get the same type of benefits.  I have access to many more doctors and often far better treatment than the majority of Europeana.  I could walk into any one of twenty urgent care clinics whenever I want to.  Waiting for a psychiatrist would be a matter of two weeks, maybe less if I had pressing issues.  Honestly, when I look at the limited options and waiting times of Europeanzs, not to mention how old much of the equipment looks, I am pretty thankful I have my healthcare.  Appts are usually 20 dollar co-pays.  Any prescriptions are 10 dollars.  And this is all on a standard insurance plan for a lower class 55k a year job.  Europeans hear about the 8% that have no health insurance and then make ridiculous assumptions about everyone.  Suffice it to say, it is most definitely not just for the wealthy.  

Education loans can be expensive, but if you are smart about it and you don't get a degree in philosophy, you can easily pay it off and then make far more than in Europe because of our higher wages.  A lot of nurses make 80-100k here, some even more than that, so when I see the 25-30k salaries in England I just feel bad for them.  

Maybe we have high depression rates, but so do Nordic countries, I don't get the big deal about that.  We work a lot, but we are well compensated.  

We only spend a little over 3% of our GDP on our.military, it isn't some ridiculous amount.  We just have a massive GDP.  And I actually am proud of the *Pax Americana* we have ushered in.  Who wouldn't be proud of creating and maintaining a world order, anyone else from weaker countries saying that are most likely lying.  Plus, we never have to worry about feeling unsafe, there isn't a military on the planet that would mess with us.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/oiejl8/the_last_four_countries_to_win_the_euro_cup_were/h4wd0eb/,quaternaryprotein,1626077009

There are definitely niche circles that are man-hatey, but they tend to be filled with domestic abuse victims and they don't involve themselves in much activism. I think you can get lost in the weeds when you use nitpicked examples of the worst shit posted online as your basis for hating something. 

Feminists have effectively spread themselves between multiple humanitarian progressive movements that enact real social change. I just don't see even an attempt of this from terminally online MRAS.

5037,"Affirmative Action and Gender Quotas in certain situations can be quite the obstacle. I lucked out being nonwhite but I guess my ""male privilege"" cancels it out. It's not just early retirement dude. The draft still A: exists and B: is male only in the united states, where feminism is very popular. Circumcision is still the default there too. Didn't france also just have a ""gender equality summit""? Not once was discrimination against males discussed. The only time ""male"" or any of its synonyms were mentioned was in a negative way. It's laid out plain and simple the absolute state of the progressive movement when it comes to men. On a world scale, it's not much better for us either. Corporal punishment, is mostly only applied to boys. Most countries which mandate military service, only do so for males and when they do for both in the case of countries like korea, the time required to serve is far more for males. It's not a competition, but if y'all wanna make it one, I'm down.

Look, when I see feminism, there are only three things I have to understand what its intentions are. It's definition, comparisons of results of changing different aspects of discrimination, and my own anecdotal experiences with feminism. For the few feminists that aren't the stereotypical man-hating asshole, they seem to be for equal rights, but are oblivious to historical and current inequalities we face. Maybe it's not wilful ignorance, but it's ignorance nonetheless. Maybe this is just a casual feminist thing, and feminist scholar-types are more aware of these issues. But how many are casuals and how many are those scholar-types? Which one has more influence, more marketability? I don't know. When you compare what feminism has done for women's rights to what they've done for men's rights, like lmao, even in this list you gave me, half of the things were intended to help women and just happened to help men as a side effect. Good on Ginsburg though, if only all of you were like that one individual, caring about both.

 This man-hating trope is not a new thing either lol. Plenty of historical feminist figures display these views. You guys make yourselves our enemies by allowing such sexist shit run through your movement. Call out misandry the same way you do misogyny. Stop trying to justify the former, or act as if the former is ok or acceptable. Don't give me that bullshit, give me equality. If feminists can't even perpetuate equality on their own, how do you suppose that they make everyone else believe in equality?

I don't deny toxic gender roles either. But it seems to me the fight against them is quite weak on one front and very strong on the other. I sincerely do hope that one day this can change. That there can be real equality. But I'll believe it when I see it happen.",,/r/europe/comments/oh2m8o/male_civil_servants_in_france_lose_fight_to/h4vvg1v/,reddut_gang,1626062774

And they're all so young, don't leave them last. At least have them shoot 2, 3, 4, with experienced players shooting 1 and 5. Maybe I am talking out my ass, cause I don't know much about football, but that's how it seems to me.

IMO they shouldn't be blamed much if at all. Too young, too unexperienced to be thrown into the pressure of a EURO finals. If it was a quarterfinal or something, I might understand.

Hopefully, being 3 guys who missed, there won't be just 1 guy taking all the shit from fans and media.

I mean here in germany the former communist party from east germany reformed itself several times and merged with the leftist parties from west germany to now for the party ""the left"". They get around 10% every eelction. The focus heavily on social topics like affordable healthcare/hosing, workers rights, etc. Only the really ahrdcore part of the party wants to really go back to communism...most are jsut a bit more left leaning then the socialist parties which are basically center left.

So you cant just conclude ""evil, bad"" based on the name on their policies. This is basically like the right wing idiots calling everything communist in the USA that is by european standarts at least center or center right policies.

Bosnians want everyone to rule Bosnia but the Serbs don't wanna live in it and Croats are mostly fine with the election law being agreed on now.

You make it seem like Dodik isn't the only one stopping Bosnia from recognizing Palestine or the Armenian genocide, he simply doesn't want the state to function while all Bosniak and Croatian leaders at least try to, ignoring the corruption.

Bosniaks siding with the occupator? Which one? Ottomans maybe because they brought the religion.

Austria-Hungary made hundreds of thousands flee to Turkey and Albania because they were scared and it wasn't until 1909 that Orthodox and Muslim people got religious autonomy from that Catholic empire.
Occupator Croats sided with.

Then SCS/SHS comes along ""reforming agri-land ownership"" which was stealing land from the Muslims and nationalising it, pushing all money to Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia tried to suffocate all individual states independence ambitions by making regions including multiple previous countries. Occupator Serbs sided with.

Tito's Yugoslavia was an attempt to fix it but it again started to be a Belgrade oligarchy.

5517,"&gt;Most western countries - not true

Most **Western European** countries

Most /məʊst/ - greatest in amount, quantity, or degree.

Here are some common definitions of Western Europe:

Western European and Others Group - 13/24 countries engaged in colonialism

UN Geoscheme - 5/9 countries enaged in colonialism

Geography: Realms, Regions, and Concepts - 7/12 countries enagaged in colonialism

CIA classification - 4/7 countries engaged in colonialism

EuroVoc - 6/12 countries 

so we can see in almost all the classifications, countries engaging in colonialism have the majority share. Thanks for playing.

&gt;You have all the rights to have that discussion in English society and I would defend you there.

I have absolutely no interest in you co-opting an important global discussion for your own selfish agenda. You clearly have not a single care for the people subject to colonialism in the past.

You also have no business speculating about timescales - I have living relatives with memory of British colonial rule. Your baseless conjecture and arguments springing from it have no meaning whatsoever.

Additionally, you seem to really bizarrely be conflating colonialism with slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. While they are often intertwined, they are not the same thing. More evidence of your agenda here.

You clearly did not read about Finnish settler colonialism in detail, or any further than page 169. I would recommend you do so.

&gt;there was nothing close to the 5% population enslavement that the Russians enforced upon the Finns.

whataboutism

&gt;You were writing untrue things.

Which ones? Nothing untrue has been said. 

&gt;I then added the fact that danish fans were spat on and harassed, all the way to families with children. It's morally reprehensible. From your lack of responses on that I gather you don't care at all.

This is just a poor way to try and divert the discussion from its actual topic - that using colonial history as a point scoring tool in football discussion as you are doing is a morally reprehensible. You still are repeatedly avoiding this point with some weak derail attempts or accusing me of defending XYZ when I haven't once mentioned them. This discussion is not about fan behaviour, it is about the inappropriateness of using colonial comparisons in football talk.",,/r/europe/comments/ohzgnc/poll_in_denmark_on_who_they_want_to_win_the_uefa/h4tvva2/,SCC_DATA_RELAY,1626026082

5596,"1970s - Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg oversees a case relating to Oklahoma gender-specific drinking age, which allowed women to drink at 18 while men had to wait until they were 21. This law was in place because men were considered inherently more reckless by Oklahoma law, and was struck down because it was made unconstitutional to treat women and men differently in the constitution.

Moritz Vs. Commissioner - Ruth Bader Ginsberg and her husband argued that a caregiver tax deduction should include single men and not just single women and previously married men. 

""Rape is Rape Campaign"" - Fought for the FBI to change their definition of rape, which only included a few mentions of penetration against women, to instead include all forms of penetration, including against men. 

Family and Medical Leave Act - Fought for massively by feminists, includes paid time off for mothers and fathers. 

Highlighting sexual assault within the military - Feminists were at the forefront of discussing the prevalence of rape and sexual assault within the military. Although the focus was on woman victims, it enabled numerous male soldiers to feel safer coming out with their experiences. 

Male Survivors - You can find many feminists within organizations such as ""Men Can Stop Rape"", whose goal is to prevent sexual assault and rapes by empowering young boys instead of focusing on self defense for young girls. Feminists have normalized discussions of rape in general. Although the resources for male survivors are far more limited than women, they used to be non-existent. Now you can find online support groups, therapy, and discussions about opening gender-neutral help centers have become mainstream. 

Civil Rights - Within the leadership of every civil rights movement I can think of there have been prominent feminists. Racial justice includes men, who are often the biggest victims of state sanctioned violence. The Prison Rape Elimination Act was fought for by feminist activist Lovisa Stannow. This policy overwhelmingly helps male prisoners, who suffer the most from prison rape. You can't walk 10 feet into a human rights organizations headquarters without running into a feminist.

Hate Crime Prevention Act - The National Organization for Women fought to change the definition of Hate Crimes to include gender and sexual orientation. The neutral language of this bill not only helps LGBT men, but any hate crimes suffered by men in general. Unless you don't consider LGBT men to be worthy of mens rights, its a positive change for men. 

Planned Parenthood - Although known for helping women, it provides health services for males. 

Gender Equality - Men who reside in nations with higher gender equality have lower mortality rates, higher well-being, lower rates of suicide and injury. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is my belief that MRAS would help men far more if they did not so dogmatically exclude themselves from feminists and instead worked with them to expand gender equity. Feminists are not rabid dogs that attack any discussion of male issues, but funding is notoriously difficult to acquire and organizations can't spread themselves too thin. 

If MRAS stopped distracting themselves with anti-feminism they could even co-opt gender-neutral humanitarian movements the same way feminist groups have in the past to achieve their goals. Prison reform, immigration policy, workers rights, child care policy, etc... These are all issues that effect billions of men on this planet but I don't often see discussed by MRAS. This is likely because many MRAS are anti-progressive and socially conservative, an ideology that is antithetical to human rights, including men.  

Take an issue like bias in family courts. The only reason men are empowered to discuss this issue is because of gender equality laws passed by feminists. Mras spit on the stepping stone that was necessary for them to even have the discussion.",,/r/europe/comments/oh2m8o/male_civil_servants_in_france_lose_fight_to/h4twq4j/,dolerbom,1626026511

5671,"&gt; Yes, we do have a dark past in the UK, but we have realised how wrong it was and have changed it completely.

No, it hasn't changed it completely. What are you saying? Your Queen and family were nervous if baby is gonna be ""brown"" just few months ago, revealed on Oprah show. Who said, it changed? England is still racist country. Have you ever had any Black Prime Minister? No. This is why BLM protests were popular in UK because everybody knows that UK is a racist country, even today. Bro, you still have Churchill statues everywhere and he said: ""Black people don't have much brain."" What are you smoking dude? What have you ""changed completely""? Black people don't agree with you on that issue for sure. You didn't change anything.

&gt; I had a wild time in a gay bar in Budapest. I've travelled more than you could ever dream of, including extensively in eastern Europe.

Sure, a lot of gays have ""wild-time"" in Tehran too. It's free to bullshit on reddit anyhow. If you have been there, you should have known that %86 of Hungarians are against LGBT content and they're agreeing with their Prime Minister. In democracy, majority rule the country. They're the majority. Why are you so shocked if you've been to Hungary? 

&gt; Spain is incredibly liberal about gay rights and hugely gay friendly.

Spanish people don't agree with you. Do you read the latest news what's happening in Spain about homosexual guy being killed because he was homosexual? I bet, you just went to Barcelona and La Rambla, you think whole Spain is like that. Why do they say ""Enough violence against homosexuals"" if Spain is ""incredibly liberal about gay rights""? Do you know Spain better than Spanish? I don't think so lol. I can tell you don't speak Spanish to begin with.

&gt; No, by 2021, 2022, 2023.

Orban is not going anytime soon. You can forget about 2021 or 2023. He's there minimum 10 years and Hungarian people generally support his ideas about LGBT community.

5677,"&gt; I'm not sure how much of England's games you've seen, but Gareth has been very tactical overall and when we have a lead towards the end of a match we tend to switch to quite a defensive and conservative approach. 

That's true, but it doesn't change the fact that Denmark had made a very aggressive round of substitions, subbing Vestergaard for Jonas Wind, but that going out of the window as Mathias Jensen had to leave the field due to an injury sustained shortly after. 

That the England team, that had bombed the Ukrainian team with 3 goals within 15-20 minutes, didn't manage to take more advantage of numerical superiority against a gimped Danish defence suffering from a huge moral setback from the penalty as well as the evident metal fatigue that has set towards the end of the tournament. 

&gt;All I'll say here is that everyone in England agrees these people should be banned for life. Apologies for the scumbags, no denying we have our share.

People know that of course it's not representing of the English people, who most people in Denmark consider to be on the exact same wavelength as us, but it just unfortunately leaves an extra layer of bitter taste that influences the experience.

5717,"&gt;You can cherry pick the countries as you want

a) It's literally a list of the countries that make up western europe or the countries playing in Euro 2020 knockouts, of which over half have a history of colonialism. How can that be cherry picking? Are you dense?

&gt;the British were the most atrocious in their slave trade both in scale and human decency.

b) Absolutely, I said nothing to the contrary of this. The British empire was the largest single act of colonialism in history, though, it should be noted that Portugal is known for having transported the most slaves.

&gt;I am disgusted by English football culture. Is it possible that this culture is derived from some larger general toxic culture? How did the Brits justify shipping Africans away from their homes against their wills while simultaneously whipping them and continuing the shipments knowing fully well that most would die on the way from the absolute shite conditions?

c) This is abhorrent, you're a disgusting person to be using slavery as a tool to score points against football fans. You need to take a long hard look in the mirror, it's exactly the point I'm making. **This clearly means nothing to you in terms of the victims of colonialism, it means everything to you as a way to put others down.**

&gt; I'm responding to your clear downplaying and whataboutism of the horrific historical event that was the British slave trade.

d) I'm not making whataboutism at all, I'm commenting that people are making points about colonialism in regards to the football match, ignoring the huge aspects of colonialism in their own countries or the ones they support. I'm saying that football rivalry aside, using the suffering of people like this is a disgusting behaviour and only belittles their plight. Just like you did above, you can't even see something as disgusting as slavery as anything other than a way to shit on english football culture.

&gt;Finland has absolutely no history of slave trade or colonialism.

e) I said that there there is plenty to be said about Finland and colonialism, and there is - despite never having held a colony. Here is some literature about settler colonialism. Finland was also a major exporter of pine tar, essential for shipbuilding, and thus a direct beneficiary of colonial expansion elsewhere. The idea that Finland sat there not getting anything from or engaging in any colonialism whatsoever is a nonsense one.

After selecting the commission president, each member state suggest a commissioner from them. These commissioners are usually members or associated with the largest governing party of member state, so this way the elections in member states influences the party membership of their commissioners.

Then commission president together with leaders of member states forms the candidate new commission. Each commissioner candidate is interviewed by EU parliament. If the parliament is not happy with some candidate, they will reject the entire commission. Usually this is not necessary, since the candidate is replaced in the commission before the vote. For example in the von der Leyen commission, Parliament rejected the original commissioner candidates from Romania, Hungary and France. So those countries already lost votes in the parliament. Also Parliament has once fired the entire commission.

5957,"Nah, it's more than that. I'll state this outright, I hate football and always have and I think a large part of that is the attitude that goes along with it. In my late 30s so when I was younger it was at the height of _British_ (not ""English""...although to be fair, I don't hear much about Welsh fans) hooliganism and I thought it was abhorrent. As I grew older though, English hooliganism started to take a back seat to how it use to be (and yes, it _obviously_ still exists) and due to both age and the internet you start to become more worldly, and rather than seeing British hooliganism with football, you see it from all over. Russian/Ukrainian ultra's, Polish nationalists...I'd be here all day if I listed all the countries off, but I will say I haven't seen much from Sweden/Norway and Denmark (maybe it exists, but they are small pop nations so less fans to make headlines) The thing is, I've seen some absolutely disgusting behaviour from Italy, NL etc. 

I'm ashamed and embarrassed by how some of the fans acted for England and I'll be honest, I care so little about the sport I don't care if we lose and part of me thinks we deserve to because of those fans but, they are an absolute minority and it isn't fair to them either, however, seeing how this sub really does go out its way to shit on England, I think it has little to do with these fans giving them a bad name (because if it were, then they _would_ be acting just as outraged over the other nations) and it's just more of an excuse to have an excuse to hate on the English.

People don't seem to understand (or I guess care) that hate breeds hate. As someone who dislikes football for it's attitude and utterly condemns the fans for what they did, someone who voted remain and has never voted Tory, I sure do get a lot of hate for just being English...despite the fact, three quarters of the UK _didn't_ vote Brexit (literally an overwhelming majority) and a majority does not vote Tories (43% thanks to FPTP) and I'll assume the vast majority of fans did not act like the few abhorrent ones) I'm far from an outliner, but here and all across reddit it seems to be not only accepted but encouraged to hate on British because of those reasons or the past which had nothing to do with any of us, while ignoring any of the good stuff (which has really shaped the world and many of you benefited from) or ignoring the fact pretty much every country has done as bad, if not worse, and still does. 

It's also often accompanied by ""it's just a joke"" when it clearly isn't, just an excuse to be racist/bigoted etc.

It is something that has never bothered me and just makes me roll my eyes but seeing it on this topic the past week has shown an astounding amount of hypocrisy.",,/r/europe/comments/ohzgnc/poll_in_denmark_on_who_they_want_to_win_the_uefa/h4sltph/,MrSoapbox,1625997357

And now that they get quite a lot of hate from other countries‘ fans they‘ll claim that it‘s only because of xenophobia and because the other countries‘ fans couldn‘t possible understand this British humor.

Then you had some idiots call the crying German girl a nazi cunt and whatever (but you could also probably find tweets like that by people from every country, still vile).


Then you had the laser pointer and the dubious penalty.
