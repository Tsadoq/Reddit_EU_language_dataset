32,"China is the least dependable ""ally"" on your list. Both Russia and the US are more realistic options as allies. Yes, our current relationship with Russia is terrible, but people also tend to forget that back in the early 2000's some EU leaders were unironically speaking of a Russian entrance to the EU within a decade or two. And after that we did become closer to Russia, slowly but surely we integrated. But then Ukraine happened. Our geopolitical interests do not necessarily clash. They do right now, though, so that requires probably a multi-decade effort to mend again to pre-Ukraine levels. And then a decade or two more until EU-membership is even possible. A truly unified Europe would be an interesting (and geopolitically possible!) prospect, but it's some serious long term work. Geopolitically this would make the EU insanely powerful though, so perhaps it's worth it. 

As for the US, they're a pretty shitty ally (""why yes, let's start a civil war in Syria, a country that borders our main ally, what could go wrong?"") but our interests are more or less the same. Problem is that the US basically does what it wants (nothing to do with Trump either) regardless whether it benefits us and it definitely is no equal relationship. The only reason we're even still in it at all is all the free stuff we get tbh. And even with that, EU leaders have now committed to a more independent foreign policy. The US is okay as an ally, but not much more. Just have to put up with their bullshit foreign policy now and then, tag along sometimes and the relationship remains stable. Yes I think US foreign policy is a disaster for the world, but that doesn't mean it can't be beneficial for the EU to condone it in exchange for other benefits. All in all I hope we ditch the US though.

 China... is miles away from us in terms of morals. We can't have an ally that we need to keep in check all the time. It'd just lead to infighting and an incredibly unstable relationship. Unless we're willing to forfeit our morals even more than we have with US foreign policy and ignore China's crimes. Not a fan of that. Besides this, China is en route to become the next global superpower. This makes them a direct competitor to the EU and not really a logical ally. In a relationship they'd try to become the dominant partner too. We already see investments made in EU countries to make them dependent on China.

Finding better methods to power agriculture machines (electric) would cut this share drastically. Finding better ways to package and transport the meat and diary would further put it down.

Also. we can always lower the emissions if we will replant pastures with the right grasses. Right now, the farmers have planted ryegrass (which is growing fast and has a good yield) but has a nasty effect on cows, forcing their digestive system to produce vast quantities of greenhouse gases.

In 2014, a UK study published in the journal Climatic Change found that eating a diet high in meat came with a cost of 7.2kg of carbon dioxide emissions per day, compared with 3.8kg for vegetarians and just 2.9kg for vegans.




According to scientist Joseph Poore of Oxford University, worldwide conversion to veganism would shrink the amount of farmland needed by 3.1 billion hectares, the size of the African continent. That land could store carbon instead, in trees for example. Poore estimates worldwide veganism could also help cut greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter.

210,"During the third quarter of 2020, some 111 700 first-time asylum seekers applied for international protection in the Member States of the European Union (EU). This was up by 132% compared with the second quarter of 2020. However, in spite of this increase, the number of applications was still lower than for the pre-COVID-19 reporting periods of the third (159 900) and the fourth quarter of 2019 (172 200).

**Most applications from Syrians, Afghans and Venezuelans**

With 18 100 first-time applicants in Q3 2020, Syrians remained the largest group of persons seeking international protection in the EU Member States, ahead of Afghans (11 200 first-time applicants) and Venezuelans (9 600). Citizens of these countries comprised the three main citizenships of first-time asylum applicants in the EU Member States, and accounted for over one-third (35%) of all first-time asylum applicants in Q3 2020.

**Most applicants for asylum in Germany, Spain and France**

The highest number of first-time applicants in Q3 2020 was registered in Germany (with 27 200 first-time asylum applicants, or 24% of total first-time applicants in the EU Member States), followed by Spain (26 900, or 24%) and France (21 700, or 19%). These three Member States together accounted for over two-thirds (68 %) of all first-time asylum applicants in the EU in Q3 2020.

**Highest number of first-time applicants relative to the population in Cyprus**

Compared with the population of each Member State, the highest rate of registered first-time applicants in Q3 2020 was recorded in Cyprus (1 848 first-time applicants per million population), Malta (1 320) and Greece (799). In contrast, the lowest rates were observed in Hungary (1 applicant per million population), Poland (8) and Estonia (9). There were in total 249 first-time asylum applicants per million population in the EU in Q3 2020.

**Almost 800 000 asylum applications still pending**

Pending applications for international protection are those that have been made at any time and are still under consideration by the relevant national authorities at the end of the reference period. In other words, they refer to the “stock” of applications for which decisions are still pending.

At the end of September 2020, 790 800 applications for asylum protection in the EU Member States were under consideration by the national authorities, a decrease of 14% compared with September 2019 and a decrease of 6% compared with June 2020. With 268 200 pending applications at the end of September 2020, Germany had the largest share in the EU (34% of the EU total), ahead of France (154 300, or 20%), Spain (101 400, or 13%) and Greece (75 700, or 10%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/kffqje/firsttime_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_up_by_132/gg86h0u/,filosoful,1608272513

**Additional statistics**: Combining pastures used for grazing with land used to grow crops for animal feed, livestock accounts for 77% of global farming land, but only produces 18% of the world’s calories and 37% of total protein.

**Explanation**:

* Animal farming requires lots of land space to keep and feed the animals and also requires lots of land space to grow crops to feed the animals, either as supplementary food or as their entire diet. Lots of land space needed for animal farming leads to the destruction of wildlife habitats.
* More land farmed means more water, pesticides and fertilisers are used, these along with lots of animal waste produced runoff into ponds, lakes and rivers, destroying aquatic life.
* Also, overfishing is a problem.

**Note**: Common methods of livestock farming today does NOT achieve species-rich grassland. Species-rich grassland requires much less grazing animals so produces little food.",England,/r/europe/comments/kfgctq/carbon_footprint_of_diets_across_the_eu/gg89wx0/,bclimit25,1608275330

&gt; The EU is insisting they must be maintained when it comes to regulations involving workers' rights, environmental protection, taxation and - in particular - state aid (or government subsidies for business).

&gt; *It refuses to guarantee the UK the best access to the single market - with no tariffs or taxes on goods crossing borders - if there is a possibility that companies based in the UK could be given state support to undercut their rivals elsewhere in Europe.*

559,"You still didn't provide a source for your claim btw. Why should I if you refuse to? The reason is : there is no source for that, it's a bad flu season with a media campaign.

Just google that the ""CDC estimates that real cases might be 8x as high"".

&gt;Every country that did a lockdown did so because ICUs would not be able to handle more covid patients for much longer.

Not true.

&gt;Contrary to your belief governments do not choose to make their economy collapse by ignorance.

This makes me believe that it was on purpose, to push the idea of a Great Reset as detailed by Klaus Schaub of the WEF in his book (and read, then parroted by leaders such as Trudeau).

&gt;I'm sure if ""buy everyone vitamin D supplements and mandate rigorous excercise"" was sufficient, then you would have seen a country succeeding with that kind of policy

This is wrong, because it argues that politicians care about your health. They don't give a shit about your immediate or lomg term health. I can guarantee you that virtually none do, especially at the top.

I can see a lot of doctors arguing for strenghtening your immune system, showing how fit and healthy people are a statistical anomaly if they get hospitalized.

There is also a staggeringly small amount of cases of infection in gyms and restaurants (google NHS data for that). The truth is - asymptomatic transmission is extremely rare (Chinese study), it's R0 Is close to 0. This is also corrobated by Fauci, who argues that asymptomatic spreaders have never ever driven a pandemic in the history of respiratory disease.

I'm going to leave Brexit for what it is, because though I am fascinated by the whole thing, I am not convinced it is really about the EU at all, certainly not in the way a Polish one party state is.

So let's get a couple of straight, article seven hasn't failed, it has stalled. Like a lot of EU processes it may get going again. The EU has failed because right now Poland and Hungary can keep each other covered on their paths to dictatorship, but the regimes there didn't come into power at the same time. The EU shrugged off Orban's power grab for years when it would have been relatively easy to act, now PiS is there too and as action became more urgent it also became a lot more difficult. That's also why we can't just wait and see, what if more illiberal nations pop up?

I would also urge you not to underestimate the risks that PiS poses to your nation.

840,"&gt;With views of Germany on one side of the mountain and Austria on the other, the Berghof was the most public of Hitler’s private homes, and it exerted a powerful hold on the Nazi imagination of empire.

&gt;Hitler and his publicists drew on mountain imagery from Germany’s literary and artistic movements (particularly Romanticism) to mythologize the Führer as a mystic leader who immersed himself in – and embodied – the terrible and magnificent forces of nature.

&gt;At the same time, the mountain served as a means to humanize Germany’s leader through his contact with animals as well as with children. In officially produced postcards, magazines and books, Germans consumed fantasies about an ideal domestic life rooted in the natural landscape.

&gt;In the expansive Lebensraum and pure mountain air, where the sun shone and blond children frolicked, the Nazis encouraged Germans to envision a blissful future in exchange for sacrifices to their pocketbooks and freedoms.

&gt;The rise of celebrity culture in the 1920s and 1930s created a voracious appetite for information about the daily lives of the rich and famous. Hitler’s team was quick to realize and exploit the public’s hunger, pioneering PR strategies that are commonplace today.

&gt;Journalists writing for the English-language press gobbled up the propaganda, fueling a false image of Hitler by publishing glowing stories of the Führer, even in the face of disturbing counter-realities.

&gt;On May 30, 1937 – a month after German planes bombed Guernica, Spain – The New York Times Magazine published a front-page article on Adolf Hitler’s idyllic mountain retreat.

&gt;In this admiring piece, penned by foreign correspondent Otto Tolischus, the skies were depicted not as a means of delivering destruction, but as a rarified topos of meditation, beauty and the simple life.

&gt;The article described how, surrounded by Alpine peaks, Germany’s leader communed with nature, contemplated the Reich and indulged his sweet tooth for chocolate. Hitler’s attack on Guernica and the suffering of its victims, later memorialized by Pablo Picasso, went unmentioned.",,/r/europe/comments/kf11xl/nazi_propaganda_showing_adolf_hitler_feeding_deer/gg5xjog/,Inner-Carrot8299,1608229035

1009,"&gt;You know Swedish police still estimates it takes 24h for a criminal to get hold of a full auto Kalashnikov here, right?

And yet they almost always rather opt for handguns, which is what’s infinitely easier getting your hands on in the Czech Republic.

&gt;It's not like our laws stops the shootings we have, because the guns are smuggled in from places like former Yugoslavia.

Yeah, that’s just… of course no law stops the crimes that *do* occur. If they’d stopped them, those crimes wouldn’t have happened, would they?

&gt;Most countries in Western Europe with laxer laws than the UK has a lower homicide rate. Belgium (who have stricter laws than we do) is the only country in Western Europe with a higher homicide rate than a state in the US. Russia has some of the strictest laws in Europe and they have a homicide rate through the roof.

Yes, I completely agree with you. Firearms offences are incredibly complex crimes that involve a lot more aspects than just access to firearms.

But that doesn’t mean that regulating and restricting access to firearms, especially handguns, and their presence on the streets isn’t part of that.

Czech society is exceedingly safe and calm, but linking that to concealed carry permits is absurd and completely devoid of scientific support. 

Switzerland for example is yet safer… but they have reasonable firearms legislation. You’re not allowed to walk around on the street with firearms “just in case”. Access and handling of ammunition is strictly regulated as well.

Permitting both liberal access to handguns, and carrying them around loaded and ready to go outside of shooting ranges serves no productive purpose. Even if a country does think it proper that handguns can be easier to purchase, it can be made safer by not allowing idiotic nonsense such as concealed carry permits.

Say that we made it as easy as the Czechs to buy handguns. Gang members still wouldn’t be better able to carry them around in public, because doing so would get them arrested and charged in court.

&gt;It's not like we lack legal firearms in the Nordic countries and they're generally some of the safest to live in too.

You’re technically correct, but consider the type of firearm. Almost all firearms in Sweden are bolt action hunting rifles and shotguns. Handguns and assault rifles especially are much too restricted for them being worth acquiring legally by criminals. That takes us back to practical considerations. Sure, they can relatively easily gain access to them anyway but since it’s illegal, that’s another troubling dimension for them. The weapons have to be kept hidden, they’ll be confiscated if found and people might go to jail just for having them. Getting to your weapons takes longer time, you can’t train with them as much so the criminals killing people with them won’t be as likely to succeed, etc.

Also take note of *which* criminals are using firearms here. It’s almost exclusively gang members. Junkies and other petty criminals have almost no chance of acquiring one, which results in holdups, robberies, burglaries, etc. being far less lethal than in e.g. America where they often do have handguns. Some crimes such as carjackings are practically nonexistent here because they’re entirely unpractical to carry out without access to firearms.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/keiowk/czech_senate_right_to_keep_and_bear_guns_will_be/gg54nqn/,LazyHussar,1608214338

1181,"You most likely know this, but back in the days (before 1930s), every bank notes was backed by gold in the corresponding national reserve. Then, governments choose to separate themselves from that constraint (though others have been in play).

Backing up paper money with commodities is pretty old, and it was necessary to ensure that people were willing to give up said commodities against bank notes. There has been a few crashes of confidence for paper money throughout history, with revolt and people paying themselves back (in France, where I live, they pay themselves back with church property I believe, before gold was used for that purpose). 

Nowadays, nobody wants to have their economy tied to the amount of metal they can unearth, this would be a pretty random limitation. But still, banks and national banks have obligations of keeping a level of reserve in their coffers in case of a big drawback (but they aren’t required to have bank notes or commodities, simple scriptural money is good).

The UK cabinet office has rejected a £33m proposal to double the capacity for French government passport checks at the port of Dover, raising the prospect of long delays for passengers after the end of the Brexit transition period.

The English Channel port, which handles 2.2m passenger vehicles every year, had requested the funding as part of the £200m Port Infrastructure Fund announced by the government in October to pay for additional border facilities required as a result of the UK’s departure from the EU.

According to a person familiar with the matter, Dover applied for £33m to double the number of French government passport booths from five to 10 in anticipation of more stringent requirements including stamps in passports after January 1.  The application was rejected, however, with Dover receiving just £33,000 for an unrelated project, according to a list of the PIF awards seen by the Financial Times.

Dover has repeatedly warned that it will need to substantially boost capacity for French controls, which under a reciprocal bilateral agreement enables passports to be checked before boarding the train or ferry to France in order to ease traffic flows.  A National Audit Office report released last month said the government’s reasonable worst-case scenario was that passenger queues could last one to two hours after January 1, but warned that in the summer “the queues and delays could become much longer”.

Tim Reardon, the head of EU exit at Dover, echoed those warnings in evidence to the House of Lords’ EU select committee last month, saying that French controls would become “more intrusive, and therefore slower” after January 1.  “That means we need more French kiosks in order to maintain the rate of flow,” he added, confirming that Dover had applied to the Port Infrastructure Fund and was “hopeful” of a positive response. 

However, Dover was disappointed when the results of the fund’s bidding process were detailed in a letter to affected MPs ahead of an expected public announcement on Wednesday.  France is deploying 700 extra customs officers and veterinary inspectors to its Channel ports, including the entrance to the Channel Tunnel near Calais, and has spent €40m on a new IT system and handling facilities. New parking zones have been paved and set aside for trucks without the correct paperwork. 

French government agencies have also conducted test runs of the control systems that will be in place at the borders regardless of whether the UK and EU reach agreement on their future trading relationship before the end of the post-Brexit transition period.

One official in Paris with knowledge of the customs plans this week expressed surprise at the “mess” and apparent lack of preparations for January 1 on the English side of the Channel.  In its letter, the cabinet office explained that the PIF had been more than twice oversubscribed, receiving 53 applications totalling £450m. 

After discounting ineligible bids, such as those deemed to be supporting the development of “wider commercial opportunities”, and forcing reductions on some other applications, the fund allocated £194m to 41 ports across the UK.  Among the big winners were the east coast ports, including Harwich which received £22.9m, and the Humber ports of Hull, Immingham and Killingholme, which received a total of almost £56m. 

However, the government said that the oversubscription to the fund had required it to finance only 66 per cent of the value of successful projects — leaving even some successful bidders disappointed.   Those warning of being underfunded included Portsmouth, which received £17.1m — a figure which the city’s Labour MP Stephen Morgan said still fell “far short” of what was required. 

“The funding awarded is not enough to cover the major infrastructure work mandated by the government’s own border operating model, and without additional contingency funding it cannot be completed in time,” he said.   Port of Dover and the cabinet office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/keuvmr/uk_rejects_dover_funding_bid_for_more_french/gg4npoy/,Hematophagian,1608200175

We can either choose to rely on offshore wind as the backbone of British power, linked to a smart, flexible, 21st century grid. Or we can opt for a nuclear revival based on the old-fashioned concept of baseload power. But we cannot rationally do both.

One cuts across the other. Big nuclear plants run 24/7. They cannot be switched on and off to match the intermittency of renewables. Trying to do both at the same time delays the cost gains of critical scale. It slows the push for a modern digital grid and cheap energy storage. It confuses investors.

There is no commercial case for giant new reactors in any developed country. They cannot meet post-Chernobyl and post-Fukushima safety demands at viable cost and have been priced out of the global energy market. Precipitous falls in renewable costs over the last five years have rendered the technology effectively obsolete in the West.

Existing plants are closing early across the US because they cannot compete. One reactor at Indian Point in New York closed in April. Its sister unit will go next year. The V.C. Summer project in South Carolina has been abandoned at a cost of $7bn. In the US the competitor is shale gas. In the UK it is offshore wind. In much of the world it is now utility-scale solar.

China still wants nuclear plants to wean itself off coal and at the same time to avoid being left at the mercy of a US energy blockade (like Japan in 1941), but China’s industrial strategy is not remotely linked to price signals.    

The Government’s White Paper on energy released this week finesses the question of cost by ignoring it. Previous White Papers at least tried to guess the future costs of different technologies. These estimates were badly wrong, vastly understating the falling costs of wind and solar. But at least they put something on paper. This time there is silence.

The reason is that Britain’s decision to press ahead with nuclear expansion - almost alone, along with France - has nothing to do with energy supply. The true motive is to underpin the military-industrial complex. The Government is being coy about admitting this. “They are willfully concealing it. The energy debate is being rigged and it’s not healthy,” said Professor Andrew Stirling from Sussex University.

By contrast, President Emmanuel Macron openly stresses the military rationale. Last week he cited the need for a flourishing French nuclear industry to sustain the country’s fleet of submarines and its next nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. ""Our strategic future and our status as a great power depends on the nuclear nexus,"" he said.

Personally, I back the UK’s independent nuclear deterrent, especially now that China's Xi Jinping has shown his true colours. But if there is going to be a large cross-subsidy for the military budget, we should have the debate out in the open, properly costed, and subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.

Critics have long claimed that the Ministry of Defence relies on civil reactors to generate uranium 235 and plutonium 238 residue needed in nuclear weapons. This is a canard. The UK has a stockpile of these fissile isotopes already. It might at a stretch need some fresh tritium for warheads since the half-life is short. 

“Where the rubber really hits the road is in nuclear submarines, and in the future for entirely new battle-field reactors to power the pulse for lasers and directed-energy weapons,” said Prof Stirling.

To sustain this military machine you need specialised skills and a stream of nuclear engineers coming out of the universities. “Without civil nuclear power, the costs become prohibitive,” he said. 

We rely on nuclear submarines because they are silent and hard to detect in the open sea, or at least they used to be before drone technology caught up with them. The transparent ocean - as it is known in naval circles -  may render them as vulnerable as battleships in World War Two, like the brand new HMS Prince of Wales sunk almost immediately by Japanese fighter-bombers. 

Should we lock ourselves into nuclear power plants lasting until 2080 in order to support a submarine deterrent that may be obsolete in ten years? I don’t know. But let us thrash it out in public.

On strict cost, there is no contest between nuclear and renewables. The strike price for Hinkley Point is £92.50 per MWh (2012 prices, inflation-indexed). The latest auctions for offshore wind on the Dogger Bank came in at £40 -  down from £117 in 2015 - and will become cheaper yet as giant turbines reach 15 megawatts and hi-tech blades push the capacity factor above 65pc. 

Of course, you are never comparing like with like with like. There are other costs, as there are for nuclear too. But even once you add in the burden of maintaining natural gas plants to cover variability and winter doldrums, the latest offshore wind farms are still far cheaper.  Moreover, the cost of energy storage from compressed air is tumbling and that can provide back-up power for days or weeks. 

Nor do they take an eternity to build. The towers are shipped in six-packs from Hull to the Hornsea field and installed along with the blades in a single day. The system is switched on the next day. The power is instantly in people’s homes. 

By 2030 it will make sense to overbuild offshore wind, harvesting the excess gigawatts to make green hydrogen at mass scale from electrolysis. This will be used for back-up power, for trucks, ships, and synthetic ‘jet zero’ aviation fuel, and for steel, cement, chemicals, and fertilizers.

The White Paper not only recognises this, the text passionately proclaims it. That is why the Government aims to quadruple the UK’s offshore wind capacity to 40 GW by end of the decade, and why the Committee on Climate Change wants 75 GW by mid-century. The near perfect wind flows over the shallow sand banks of the North Sea happen to give the UK a global competitive advantage.

So why the awkward section on nuclear power, and the promise to sign off on a £20bn Hinkley replica at Sizewell C with EDF under this Parliament  even though China’s CGN has hinted that it may pull out the project? That will leave a gaping hole in funding. The taxpayer will have to dig deep.

The Government says costs will come down. That is always the pitch. What we know is that the two prototype EPR reactors at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland are a decade late and shockingly over budget, struggling with the Sisyphean task of trying to meet safety demands.
An EPR nuclear reactor in Flamanville, France

The French Cours des Comptes has issued a blistering report, calling the project a “failure” that will ultimately cost four times the original plan. The spending watchdog poured cold water on promises by EDF that future models would be much cheaper, stating that it could not validate such claims “with a reasonable degree of certainty”.

The Government’s White Paper makes much of Britain’s push into small modular reactors (SMRs). But quite how a smaller version of a big plant can be cheaper per megawatt hour is a mystery. It violates the law of economies of scale. 

Perhaps there are advanced SMRs with radically different technology, such as molten salt or using convection, that are cleaner, more flexible, and can pull off a quantum shift in costs. But if so, why waste finite money on white elephants such as Sizewell C and Bradwell B?

If we are to commit to a fleet of nuclear plants at £20bn a shot and lock in high tariffs for consumers as far out as the late 21st century, we citizens deserve a better explanation. By all means let us fund a robust nuclear deterrent - within reason - but please stop pretending that it is energy policy.",,/r/europe/comments/keqdx2/britains_push_for_nuclear_power_makes_no_sense/gg48a7t/,dhyana,1608185978

1531,"If you own (and live there) there is a notional rental value calculated for your property, which you are then taxed on.

However your mortgage interest (and other value maintaining work on the property) are tax deductible, so it is often cheaper to never outright own your home.

Once you’ve reached about 35% equity of the original purchase price, banks are typically happy to let you pay interest only, rather than amortize the principle. As interest rates have been very low for years, people usually take this risk although most owners I know have &gt;50% equity.

So you can end up living in a family-sized place and only pay 1000chf a month interest (for example) which is then mostly or sometimes fully deducted against your property tax / rental value tax.

In theory you would use this significant monthly saving to invest in your retirement,

\- They tax you for a rent that you don't actually earn, but as a consolation allow you to tax deduct your mortgage payments.

\- If you pay off your home mortgage you have to continue to pay a tax as if you are deriving a rental income from the home.

\- So in retirement you will either continue to pay a mortage or pay the whole rental value tax.

Some more questions if you don't mind:

\- Is the rental value usually market rates?

\- Is this rental value taxed at your marginal tax rate?

1616,"&gt;It also means a lot of people have money to spend in the US, which means a huge amount of foreign investment in the US, and it's easy for US firms to borrow to grow. The dollar almost certainly is somewhat over-valued, but it's hardly unique in that, it does have an issue in that it tends to see a flight toward it when there is a crisis (but then that's true for Switzerland too). All in it almost certainly doesn't undermine growth.

People want to invest money in the US because the US market has had much higher returns over the long term. That’s been the case for the past 120 years, even before World War II. The US is less risky because it’s more stable than Europe, and has more solid economic fundamentals. People know that Switzerland and the US are safe investment locations because they have long, long track records for both political and economic stability. 


&gt;It has been happening for decades though, the relative power of the US and the dollar has fallen as other economies have grown and the US share of the global economy has shrunk. It's still by far the most dominant (and frankly the Euro isn't going to get close unless there is wider adoption and the EU manage to link various bits of policy that currently aren't and can't be, given the mess that is the Euro's underpinnings at this point).

The relative power of the US has been increasing compared to Europe. Even 10 years ago the EU’s economy and as significantly larger than the US, but the US surpassed Europe in GDP a few years ago even before the UK officially brexited. Which currency is going to replace it? The Yuan? It’s not even traded internationally. 

&gt;It doesn't have to be replaced.. It'll just be a smaller share in global reserves, and more transactions will happen with other currencies. That's hardly novel or unexpected, we've seen it before (the Pound for a while, the Dutch before that etc..).

Maybe, maybe not. At a certain point it’s not very important what the unit of measurement is, so much as it’s just important to have a unit of measurement. 


&gt;Absolutely, the Eurozone will be a competitor, but it won't come close to being able to supplant the dollar or replace the US in its current position, indeed I don't think anyone will. But that doesn't mean that the direction of travel isn't away from dollar dominance.

Maybe 

&gt;Absolutely, and I agree on the double dip too, but the US does have vastly more scope for QE and for borrowing (certainly in absolute terms) than most, and doesn't see the negatives to the same degree. I mean the US now has something like 140% debt to GDP (both due to the tax changes and the pandemic..) and its unlikely to see any issues as a result, to the point that there doesn't seem to be much interest at all in addressing that. Obviously Euro countries aren't easy equivalents (not managing your own currency is a rather interesting, if scary approach..) but there is still a risk there for the US.

Where are you getting the number 140% from? I don’t think you understand what the actual figures are. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the U.S. federal debt held by the public will reach 98.2% of GDP, or $20.3 trillion, by the end of 2020. And that’s gross debt, not net debt, because like 15% of it is owed by the US government to itself.

It’s not more indebted than Western Europe is. It makes complete sense to borrow gigantic amounts at near zero interest rates to stave off recession. That’s why US GDP isn’t projected to fall nearly as much as European countries.",,/r/europe/comments/kecb5w/us_declares_switzerland_to_be_currency_manipulator/gg3ku7k/,JSanchez504,1608171736

1622,"Portugal almost lost its independence during the Middle Ages when a king of Castile tried to enforce the claims of his wife, daughter to the late king of Portugal. The Portuguese crowned an illegitimate son of the dead king instead and resisted the Castillian invasion.

During the sixteenth century there was another war which effectively ended Portugal's independence. Again, the cause was a king that died without legitimate heirs. Philip II of Spain claimed the throne through his mother, who was a Portuguese Infanta and sent an invasion force commanded by the Duke of Alba. The country was subdued, but not annexed to the Castillian crown and kept separate institutions and laws. Philip was crowned as King Philip I of Portugal, title that passed to his son and grandson.

A revolt in the late 17th c restored Portuguese independence. The Spanish crown was exhausted, as it had to smash rebellions in Catalonia and was fighting against the Dutch at the same time.

Both wars were ""I'm gonna conquer all your shit"" wars.

1658,"&gt; People want to invest money in the US because the US market has had much higher returns over the long term. That’s been the case for the past 120 years, even before World War II. The US is less risky because it’s more stable than Europe, and has more solid economic fundamentals. People know that Switzerland and the US are safe investment locations because they have long, long track records for both political and economic stability.

Firstly, Switzerland doesn't come close to the level of FDI the US sees, the US, UK and Netherlands top the list (all countries that are politically stable, albeit with varying long term growth). The US is certainly seen as safe, but it is coupled to the dollar in the US context because it allows foreign entities to hold dollars (which in many cases they need to do for trade) and see a return.

&gt;The relative power of the US has been increasing compared to Europe. Even 10 years ago the EU’s economy and as significantly larger than the US, but the US surpassed Europe in GDP a few years ago even before the UK officially brexited. 

I assume you mean the EU not Europe, and yeah, I agree, Europe is failing to make use of its size effectively and likely won't be able to unless it integrates significantly, I can't see it doing that rapidly enough.. China however has seen it's share of global GDP skyrocket, India has seen it's share double (although it is still small..). The US continues to fall and more and more transactions are not carried out in dollars. In terms of the global reserve, it dipped on the introduction of the Euro (and recovered when the DM was binned), but has been falling pretty steadily since.

&gt;Which currency is going to replace it? The Yuan? It’s not even traded internationally.

Again, it won't be replaced by a single currency. But it almost certainly will see itself drop as a share of all reserve currencies, quite likely below the 50% mark. The same goes for dollars use in trade, it won't find itself replaced by a single currency, it will simply hold a smaller and smaller share of total transactions.

&gt;Maybe, maybe not. At a certain point it’s not very important what the unit of measurement is, so much as it’s just important to have a unit of measurement.

It's important in that it gives the US outsized control over non-US dealings, because it controls the currency in which those dealings are carried out. The need to hold dollars gives the US an edge too. That isn't going to disappear, but if it weakens, the US's influence weakens too, and not in the sense that some other state will replace it, but rather that it will have less capacity to impose, it'll mean that the US has less of an ability to dictate (or at least dominate..) international trade norms (although you could argue that Trump already undermined that to a large extent, we'll see where that goes next).

&gt;Where are you getting the number 140% from? I don’t think you understand what the actual figures are. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the U.S. federal debt held by the public will reach 98.2% of GDP, or $20.3 trillion, by the end of 2020. And that’s gross debt, not net debt, because like 15% of it is owed by the US government to itself.

US public debt ([As per the the US treasury](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2020/opds112020.prn)) sat at 27,446,288, that includes intergovernmental debt,  (so that's the various trust fund liabilities the US actually has and the bits the government owes to itself). But you can pick any of the various metrics, Government debt works just as well, it's not so much the total proportion, but the recent increase and direction of travel after all.

&gt;It’s not more indebted than Western Europe is.

Western Europe isn't a country obviously, and a lot of the very high debt countries (and those that have seen significant increases in debt) have had massive issues over the last decade because of that debt. Not an issue that the US has to contend with.

&gt;It makes complete sense to borrow gigantic amounts at near zero interest rates to stave off recession. 

It does if it is spent sensibly (and I wish the UK government was looking at it in that way at the moment..), but that doesn't work for a lot of countries (and gets more complicated with the Eurozone...). Most governments have access to low interest rate borrowing at the moment, but they can only take up so much of that before it ceases to be low interest. The US on the other hand has vastly more scope, at least in part because of the demand for the dollar.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/kecb5w/us_declares_switzerland_to_be_currency_manipulator/gg3ornu/,-ah,1608173787

The US is certainly seen  as safe, but it is coupled to the dollar in the US context because it  allows foreign entities to hold dollars (which in many cases they need  to do for trade) and see a return.

I think the FDI figures in the UK and Netherlands are heavily skewed. If you look on like Wikipedia it says that like the Netherlands had $800 billion more FDI than the US. That sounds like some tax haven financial engineering that only exists on paper.

What I'm saying is that Europe share of global GDP (or the EU's share because this applies to both) is falling ***even faster*** than the US's share of Global GDP. The US has a larger economy than the EU (including the UK), and is growing faster. And China's increased GDP still hasn't caused anyone to use the Yuan outside of China.

It does not give the US outsized economic control over anything. Otherwise, the US wouldn't be running such a huge trade deficit if it had some way to stop that. It's irrelevant to the US economy whether the US sanctions Iran or not.

Government debt ***does not*** work just as well. You can't just do your own bullshit back of the envelope calculation of US government to say it's 140% of GDP when it's really 98% of GDP once you strip out money that the US government owes to itself. 

&gt;Western  Europe isn't a country obviously, and a lot of the very high debt  countries (and those that have seen significant increases in debt) have  had massive issues over the last decade because of that debt. Not an  issue that the US has to contend with.

It's irrelevant that western Europe is or isn't' a country. France is a country, Spain is a country, Italy is a country, the UK is a country, all these countries have near or larger debt than the US to GDP. 

The UK has had the same massive increase in debt as the US. That's exactly why the US and UK economies did so much better than many other developed nations. You're conflating the cure with the disease. 

&gt;It  does if it is spent sensibly (and I wish the UK government was looking  at it in that way at the moment..), but that doesn't work for a lot of  countries (and gets more complicated with the Eurozone...). Most  governments have access to low interest rate borrowing at the moment,  but they can only take up so much of that before it ceases to be low  interest. The US on the other hand has vastly more scope, at least in  part because of the demand for the dollar.

The US is in the same boat as the Eurozone. The difference is that the US has more competent economists working at its central bank compared to the Germans who have some much sway over the ECB. You want to know what economic incompetence looks like is when it comes to monetary policy? The Eurozone.

&gt;  
&gt;The record-setting television deal was, in hindsight, far too good to be true.  
&gt;  
&gt;The billion euros the upstart media company had promised to pay to televise French soccer matches each year represented an increase of 60 percent on the league’s previous television deal, and much more than any other bidder had offered. It was a sum so large — about $1.2 billion a year — that it led officials from the league and the club executives on its board to ignore obvious warning signs; to brush aside the fact that the company making the offer, MediaPro, had no history in French soccer; and to close an agreement without the type of bank guarantees that might have ensured that all that money would eventually arrive.  
&gt;  
&gt;And then the deal simply vanished.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, arbitration talks between the Ligue de Football Professionnel (L.F.P.), the governing body for professional soccer in France, and MediaPro, a Spanish broadcaster now controlled by Chinese interests, ended with the company handing back the four years of rights under its control and less than a third of the more than 300 million euros it owes for games this season.  
&gt;  
&gt;The resolution has left league officials frantically searching for a new television partner, and teams facing a very different financial future.  For the clubs, the repercussions may be immediate. Instead of being flush with enough cash to build teams to rival those in Germany and Spain, most French teams are facing restructuring measures, starting with the sale of players when Europe’s player trading window reopens in January.   
&gt;  
&gt; For the clubs, the repercussions may be immediate. Instead of being flush with enough cash to build teams to rival those in Germany and Spain, most French teams are facing restructuring measures, starting with the sale of players when Europe’s player trading window reopens in January.   
&gt;  
&gt; One team director described the situation as “a total disaster.” The chief executive of another one said the situation — coupled with the continuing financial effects of the coronavirus pandemic — was “hugely damaging.” The president of the French champion Paris St.-Germain, Nasser al-Khelaifi, asked the league’s new leaders to conduct a full investigation into the process that ended in catastrophe for France’s teams. Al-Khelaifi is also chairman of beIN Media Group, a rival to MediaPro for rights.  
&gt;  
&gt;What may hurt most, at least from the teams’ perspective, is that it is a crisis of their own making. The trouble began in the spring. As all of Europe’s major soccer leagues plotted ways to reboot, the French league announced it would be the only one not to complete its suspended campaign.  
&gt;  
&gt;A government decree ended the season early, forcing Ligue 1 to tap a national loan program to ensure its teams did not fall into financial ruin. Only the prospect of record-breaking broadcast revenues, set to take effect with the start of the MediaPro deal this season, softened the blow.  
&gt;  
&gt;The agreement, signed in 2018, had been trumpeted as groundbreaking then, a contract worth more than a billion euros per season (about $1.2 billion) for rights to matches in France’s top two domestic divisions. That symbolic figure was one that team executives had long hoped to realize, and one so large that it led them to part ways with the league’s partner, Canal+.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the financial boost — MediaPro had agreed to pay almost 60 percent more than the previous agreement — also led teams to spend more on recruitment in the last off-season, a decision that many are now regretting.  
&gt;  
&gt;“They had anticipated the higher TV rates, and this comes as a shock for most people,” said the chief executive, who asked not to be identified because talks to stabilize the league’s finances continue. He predicted some clubs would look to foreign investors to bail them out in return for heavily discounted equity or outright sales.",,/r/europe/comments/kelle1/french_soccer_faces_financial_crisis_after_record/gg365yy/,KevTravels,1608163866

1810,"okay

you got me there

i was never aware of chlorine washed salad/why there was a ban on chlorinated chicken in the first place so i did a quick google search (no i'm not an expert so take everything i write with a grain of salt)

okay, so there are 2 sides to this argument and i'm still against chlorinated chicken just to make this clear

it looks like chlorinated chicken was banned from using in the eu and by extention the uk in 1997 and the reasoning back then was that if chlorine washed chicken would be an normal practice the hygene practices could and probably would be lowered to save on costs

so it looks like all the time i had the wrong opinion on why chlorinated chicken could be a bad idea but i'm still against it because i like to eat food which was raised in a good hygiene enviroment and it seems like our chicken here in europe has less bacteria than chlorine washed chicken in the us

i'm also a big proponent of eating food from localy raised animals and grown food so i'm not really in favour of food from abroad

and yes, I might be in the minority with this opinion (I only buy meat from the supermarket i buy organic but then again i'm not eating thst much meat anymore why i can afford to do so) but i like my meat to be of the highest quality which i can afford and i don't like to have the quality of life for animals to go down (they are allready bad enough in most cases)

My point stands, all your examples were mere evolutions of an already existing product without a significant overhaul behind them, hence no true inventions.

The only two inventions you indirectly pointed out were smartphone (yes, an evolution of a mobile phone, yet far more revolutionary) and gig economy. But, instead of identifying actual innovations, you just picked random brands that operate those.

&gt; The last Labour Government provided only limited help to
miners leaving the industry. For example, men over 50 received no capital payments
before 1979. Greatly improved terms have been introduced by this Government
through the Redundant Mineworkers' Payment Scheme. Today a miner of 50 receives
£1,000 for each year of service and a percentage of his wage until retirement. For
those under 50, a capital sum of £1,000 for every year of service has been available.
In line with the industry's commitment to return to complete financial independence
the Redundant Mineworkers' Payments Scheme will end in March 1987. In its place,
under the terms of the Coal Industry Act 1987 the Government will have powers to
pay grants towards costs incurred by British Coal in redeploying and reducing their
workforce, and the maintenance of concessionary coal and welfare arrangements.",England,/r/europe/comments/kb4yz1/macron_on_euuk_fishing_feud_im_not_giving_my/gg1ycox/,my_october_symphony,1608142543

2086,"That is incorrect, and very off with the timeline. How could the French cover the retreat before the breakthrough that caused the retreat?

Reconnaisance planes spotted and reported the huge column of German military vehicles and men leading to the Ardenne. The French generals ignored it because they just assumed that the terrain was too rough for the Germans to get through. Nothing was done about the reports, and the area around the Ardennes was left very lightly protected. Even after the breakthrough and capture of Sedan was reported, French generals delayed for far too long before counter attacking. The speed and distance of the breakthrough left the German's very vulnerable, but the opportunity to annihilate it was missed.

That's why the breakthrough succeeded to such a huge degree. France and the UK would not have needed to retreat without Guderian's plan and the fact that it was reported but ignored by specific French generals.

The French armies that were also cut off provided rearguard actions after the breakthrough, and did very well.

2114,"u/nonstoptilldawn is right. God in Arabic is Allah. Here's the following from Almaany Arabic Dictionary:

الله : (معجم الوسيط) : (معجم الوسيط)

 الله  : عَلَم على الإله المَعْبُود بحق. 

 أصْله إله، دخلت عليه أَل، ثم حذفت همزته وأُدغم اللامان.

The word ""Allah"" comes from the word ""ilah"" (which means: a god, unspecific; indefinite), in it, ""Al"" (definitive ""The"" in Arabic) was added, then the Hamzah (this letter: أ) was removed then idgham (don't know how to translate it to English, but [here's ](https://youtu.be/urHp2jaMENw)a video explaining idgham) was made through the two Laams (this letter: ل). 

&gt;""Hum ya'budon allahatihm"" (هم يعبدون اللهتهم)

Here we don't say Allahatihm because in the first place, there is NO plural word for Allah. As the definition from the dictionary explains, Allah means the God that is rightfully worshipped and it is used by Arabs generally.

More evidence, if you search the word Allah (الله) in an Arabic bible you will see that it is used thousands of times, I will list just three instances here while writing in bold the Arabic and English:

تك 1في البدء خلق **الله** السماوات والارض

Genesis 1:1 In the beginning **God** created the heavens and the earth.

فدعت الصبي ايخابود قائلة قد زال المجد من اسرائيل لان تابوت **الله** قد اخذ ولاجل حميها ورجلها.

1 Samuel 4:21 She named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The Glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of **God** and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.

Not even close, and then we're not even talking about social acceptability. And no, your claim doesn't hold as prostitutes in those countries have a much stronger socioeconomic position than elsewhere, despite human trafficking still existing.

2239,"You do realize that it's about the same word in different languages, right? This map shows the differences in etymology of the word election/verkiezing/Wahl/etc. between all the different European languages.

But to answer your question:  


&gt; **Irish** *toghchán*, **Scottish Gaelic** *taghadh*, **Dutch** *verkiezing*, and **Icelandic** *kosningar* all come from Proto-Indo-European \*ǵews- (“to taste, try, choose”), which is, by the way, also the origin of the English word “choose”. 

while 

&gt; The **English** word “election”, **French** *élection*, **Spanish** *elección*, etc., come from the Latin word *ēlectiōn*, which in turn comes from *ēligō* (“I choose”), which is a contraction of *ex-legō* (literally “from-choose”), from Proto-Indo-European \*leǵ- “to gather, collect”. This form makes it clearer how it is related to **Greek** *eklogí*, **Romanian** *alegeri*, and **Albanian** *zgjedhje*.

Legalizing safer alternatives offers a solution to prohibition. Want to undermine the black market selling heroin? Legalize methadone. It's a dangerous, addictive opiate in its own right. But nowhere near heroin. 

Want to make people use meth? Decrease the availability of its alternatives the way we're trying (but luckily failing miserably). If coke, MDMA and amphetamine aren't available, certain people will start cooking meth instead. 

That said, we do definitely need strong regulations. Advertisements for drugs should never be allowed, for example. Imo sale to consumers should be state monopoly; and each drug should be taxed at a rate that minimizes harm to society. In effect that means artificially increasing the price of more harmful drugs (i.e. heroin) until it's vastly above methadon.

From the modern perspective it sounds absurd given this was also the era of mass slavery and we see exactly how colonies became massive cash cows - funneling resources off to Europe.

For the native peoples at the bottom of the social order it probably didn't make much difference - a foreign ruler syphoning off wealth is much the same effect as a local ruler doing the same.

As to who ended up as foreign service from Scotland and Ireland - the social order was maintained. The officer class came from ""gentlemen"" - the trope of the 2nd or 3rd son of the Laird going off to make their fortune abroad is somewhat true. Certainly in Ireland, a large number of the common soldiers joined because it was one of the few reasonably paid jobs which was available. It's difficult to allocate blame there as discipline was typically brutal and they had almost no influence on policy.

It's worth noting that the Celts in what's now Ukraine were on the very fringe of the eastern Celts and probably assimilated into the surrounding populations fairly early. It's not even clear if they spoke a Celtic language or if they just had a very Celtic influenced material culture. 

So there may have been early Slavs in the same region at the same time as well, it wasn't a Celtic region overall there were just some Celts present around 300BC.

2567,"An explanation i found on the internet. "" The reason why Portuguese and Spanish sound so different is the Gaulish people, and its predecessors, the Celts, held strongest in the Northwest Iberian peninsula of what is modern day Galicia and Northern Portugal. During the Reconquesta, those same people of North West Iberia branched off into modern day Portugal. Its a fact that Suebi and Visigoths dominated Northwest particularly for 300 years, they fully integrated and lead the reconquest to the south. It is my opinion based on this modern evidence that all of Northern Iberia peninsula sounded like modern Portuguese, but Spanish today is highly Castillianized from politics reasons. Thats why Portuguese sounds so similar to the French, who have a strong Gaulic/Celtic past. Equally, the Celts and Gauls were also in East Europe in modern day west Russia, the tail end of Mongol control. It seems to me that the Gauls/Celts in North iberia influnced Portuguese like they also influenced Russian language. Today, the dominent Celtic gene for red hair is strong in a particular region of West Russia, being just one example of similarity ""

2768,"&gt;Excuse my Wikipedia mouth, but Armenians are also one of the genetic isolates of the Near East who share affinity with the Neolithic farmers who expanded into Europe beginning around 8,000 years ago.

There's a difference between autosomal ancestry and your haplogroup. Your haplogroup is just chromosomes which doesn't effect your autosomal genetic makeup. Also, while haplogroup R1b is the ""majority"" in Armenia and is thought to be associated with the expansion of Indo-European speakers, only 28% of Armenians have this haplogroup. The next most common haplogroup among Armenians is J2, which is 22% (pulled from Khazaria). Other studies have slightly differing allocations, but all in the ballpark of 26-30% and 20-25%. 

You also find various types of peoples with this R1b haplogroup. The Fulani peoples in Cameroon for instance (a black African peoples) have far higher percentages of R1b than Armenia for instance. You can also find an enormous concentration of R1b among Turkmen peoples... It's pretty irrelevant. The only thing all these people have is a common ancestor who lived on this planet 10000+ years ago.

And making that legal to consume, that also means that we can recognise that it exists and can make policies to do prevention and to accompany the ones who want to stop (aka the majority). If you just criminalise everyone, you cannot offer proper prevention because “it does not exist” in your country. Plus, people will not seek for help to stop because they will be put in prisons. 
There is also the question of public Health and sanitation about the places for hard drug administration. If it’s legal to consume, you can create safe spaces to have a direct access to the people addicted and “hide” it from everyone, while if you have not, drug addicts will do that with unhealthy means and will leave their syringes in places where children could find and hurt themselves.

2951,"&gt; go ask your religious leader 

I mean, part of the problem might be that I don't have one.

&gt;10 commandments ? - literally the foundation of Christian and Judaism faith?

Are they the foundation of Christian faith, I thought it was that ""Jesus as your lord and savior"" stuff? Anyway, they say you should ""honour the sabbath"", but from what I can remember that involved more building fancy altars than specifically going to church.

&gt;There is a rule implied that if you do not get born from Scotish parents or at least get raised in Scotland you are not one regardless how strong personal opinion you may hold. Since this is organized religion that has rules - they expect you to follow them. Its actually ridiculus I have to explain that.

&gt;I.e - No true Christian worships Buddha - total fallacy because it starts with ""no true"" right? You can totally worship him and mark ""Christian"" at government census.

I don't know what you're about. There are plenty of variation in organised religion, some of them might worship Jesus as a buddha, others don't consider him divine (say, unitarians), and so on.

Point being, there are lots of rules, but they seem to vary a great deal, and which ones you're supposed to follow likewise.

But since people keep telling me that, I'll grant there are many denominations that actually require regular church attendance. In my defense I wasn't familiar with any of them.",Gifu,/r/europe/comments/kdn6iw/percentage_of_population_who_seldom_or_never/gfzaxx8/,Rotanloukku,1608078398

3018,"&gt;ABSTRACT Data from recent studies have shown an increase in substance use and addictive behaviours in Singapore. However, training and services still lag behind this trend, which means the provision of adequate treatment is lacking in spite of good evidence that treatment approaches for addiction disorders are effective. There is a need to train more manpower for this purpose, especially in primary healthcare. Another challenge is to ramp up services as quickly as possible to manage the growing number of addicts. Research should also focus on special populations, while public health education and national policies can be improved, particularly to curb binge drinking. We need to be open to the use of harm-reduction therapies and substitution treatments, as addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder with significant health and psychosocial morbidity.

I’m laughing at you, putting your emotions forward when commenting on international politics. I understand you hate our country, most people here do. But international affairs are no joke and should be handled with utmost caution and with rational thinking. Just because you hate Turkey does not mean that United States will kick them out of NATO. Turkey is #2 military in NATO and is located so strategically to initiate Middle Eastern operations. So United States cannot take a risk of losing such a precious ally. Putting all of this aside, I really doubt United States will listen to a state who cannot even eat or drink without Russia’s express consent. (No offense) 

When it comes to Greece, yes, I agree that Erdogan is pushing his limits to get on Greeks’ nerves. But he does that intentionally because he knows that he is losing votes so rapidly because of economical problems. He knows that the best way to unite the people is to create an external threat.

Basically speeding the process up by guaranteeing agreement in all by removing everyone who disagrees. A charade of democracy, if you will. Is that the plan?

Why co-opt this union though? Why not create the federation you're clearly asking for? It could even join the EU.

As for the rest:
Power proportional to population or production would only lead to resentment, which would force the weak countries to ""unionize*. There's a reason that's not how federations usually/ever work.  
  
Countries are already using the stability of the Euro to borrow. It might even be a contributing factor. Any guarantee without the federation also taking direct control of the member state's economy stand little chance of being anything but debt sharing in practice. Additionally, the shared trust goes both ways.

Are you talking about the value of France and Germany not fighting eachother? Do they want protection money? If not, then NATO offer way more protection than the EU currently does. No one is pinning their hopes on the EU. Not Germany, and not the only nuclear power left in the union.

3479,"Croatia is one of the countries where this is practiced very often.

The thing is, Croatia, as Italy's neighbor, was the core tenant of the Roman Republic/Empire for centuries, and we have an insane amount of Roman/Ilyrian historical artifacts from that era and many monumental architecture pieces.

For instance, we have three significant historical Roman landmarks in Croatia. One is the Colosseum in Pula, one of the only two made. Not as famous, big or widely recognized as the Roman Colosseum, but Pula's Colosseum is also a historical monument.

The second one is the Diocletian in Split, a personal residence of Roman Emperor Diocletian built at the start of the 4th century AD, that is still preserved and forms much of Old Town in Split.

The third, largest, and the most famous site, thanks to being prominently featured as the filming location for King's Landing in GoT, is Dubrovnik, where the entirety of the Old Town is considered an UNESCO heritage site.

There are simply so many fucking archeological digs and sites that it would drain too many state resources if we were to uncover them all, and not enough archeologists to cover them properly, and many of them are underneath our cities and sometimes, the findings aren't significant enough or they simply provide us with something already written and well established.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/kdgm08/illyrian_helmets_over_2_thousand_years_old_are/gfx8p6n/,Phtpnk,1608042301

The members of ASALA, an Armenian association that targeted and murdered Turkish diplomats all around the world and, as such, are recognized by many countries (including the United States of America) as a **terrorist organization**, are honored as national heroes in your country.

Monte Melkonian, one of the leaders of ASALA, is [glorified](http://westernarmeniatv.com/en/46432/june-12-as-the-commemoration-day-of-monte-avo-melkonian) by Armenians for having killed Turkish diplomats and for playing a leading role in Armenia’s war against Azerbaijan. Since Armenia gained independence in the early 1990s statues have been built in his honor, also his name has been given to educational institutions, and even a [foundation](http://westernarmeniatv.com/en/46432/june-12-as-the-commemoration-day-of-monte-avo-melkonian) named after him. In the cemetery where he is buried, there is a memorial built in honor of ASALA. In 2014, in a live broadcast, another ASALA memorial was [unveiled](http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/photoset/5643/43951) in the Armenian city of Vanadzor with the participation of the priests of the Armenian Apostolic Church and the national church of Armenia.

Varoujan Karapetyan, another ASALA member and the head of the organization’s French branch, was welcomed in Armenia as a national hero, after having spent nearly 20 years in jail in France, for [the fatal bombing attack](https://www.jpost.com/Blogs/Think-With-Me/Varoujan-Garabedian-Armenias-Adulated-Terrorist-507805) against Turkish diplomats at Orly Airport in Paris. The eight victims of the attack were not only Turkish citizens: apart from two Turkish nationals, four French, one American and one Swedish lost their lives in that incident. But this did not keep Armenian politicians and intellectuals from campaigning for his early release and heroizing him at the highest level.

Not only the members of ASALA are commemorated in such vehemence, but also and maybe even more dangerously, the people who collaborated with Nazis and exterminated thousands of people are honored by Armenians.

Most prominently, Garegin Nzhdeh, a wartime Nazi collaborator from Armenia and founder of a supremacist ideology called [Tseghakronism](https://www.turkishnews.com/en/content/2016/06/27/what-is-tseghakronism-fascist-doctrine-of-garegin-nzhdeh/) (the combination of two Armenian words for “race” and “religion”) is continued to be glorified, [despite international condemnation](http://www.ng.ru/kartblansh/2018-02-06/3_7166_kartblansh.html). In 2016, with the attendance of the President, Prime Minister, Speaker and Deputy Speakers of the National Assembly, Armenians unveiled a statute to Garegin Nzhdeh, in the center of the capital city, Yerevan.

In addition to this, one of the most recent monuments dedicated to a war criminal was [erected](https://jam-news.net/gurcustanda-qarabag-muharib%C9%99si-q%C9%99hr%C9%99maninin-abid%C9%99sinin-acilisi-%C9%99trafinda-qalmaqal/?lang=az-AZ) this year in the Armenian-dominated region of Samtkhe-Javakheti in Georgia. On January 20, the day of which the Azerbaijani people mourn the victims of a massacre [committed](http://www.visions.az/en/news/103/76d93934/) by Soviet troops in Baku in 1990, Armenia opened a monument of Mikhail Avagyan with a ceremony, who was an Armenian military officer who took part in the extermination of hundreds of people in Khojaly village in Azerbaijan in 1992, the largest massacre committed during the conflict according to the Human Rights Watch.

Taking into account ongoing conflicts, the erection of statues of “national heroes” who fall into the category of ‘war criminals” by international standards, undermines the efforts promoted by the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs “to prepare the populations for peace”, an initiative which deals with the resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and, in general, the international efforts for promoting reconciliation in the region. On the other hand, and more dangerously, these types of monuments justify and legitimize terrorist tactics in the pursuit of alleged national causes and encourage the next generation to follow suit.

Ostensibly, the memorials and statues to terrorists and Nazi collaborators do not naturally revive the past; on the contrary, they honor a specific vision of the attitude of society toward the past and shape the collective memory in an unproductive way. 

The removal of these memorials from Armenia, following the example of the [removal](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/sep/26/statue-wars-what-should-we-do-with-troublesome-monuments?fbclid=IwAR1a320hk5fO4MIKgVf0NPiBnrMFY23WYlaew7mhcFLl13ZIGKKRpUQOp_k) of statutes to questionable historical figures around the world, is necessary to give due respect to thousands of victims. It would also be a good starting point for reconciliation between Armenia and its neighbors, making an important contribution to the settlement of the violent conflicts in the region.

The man who is endowed with important personal qualities will be only too ready to see clearly in what respects his own nation falls short, since their failings will be constantly before his eyes. But every miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud adopts, as a last resource, pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and glad to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority.

I have no doubt the assassination of that general was to try to provoke Iran into some kind of retaliatory action that could be used as a casus belli.

3672,"Not to you, but to the field of archeology, it does. 

When your entire study and carreer has been about the rise AND fall of entire sophisticated civilizations, loss of documents etc, you ll be much more open to the possibility that its not 100% guarenteed that archeologists digging the same site in a few thousand years can be considered ""our"" civilization.

We have lost many documents, artifacts etc because we centralized their storage and then that storage was plundered, went up in flames or simply forgotten about. Most famous example is the library of Alexandria, but also the fire of the 200 year old Museum in Rio de Janeiro last year. 100s of artifacts that will never be accesible again. They wouldve been safer in the ground.

Yes, to our individual lifes accidents like that are rare. However thats not the case when you take a step back and look at human history as a whole. Hundreds, if not thousands, of libraries, museums and private colletions will go up in flames before the year 4.000. 

""Just take pictures and google it"" is true, but is based on the assumption that our civilization will last, that we will be able to pass on all that we know to the next generation, for thousands of years to come. 

A few global disasters might easily change that. Archeologists are a bit more accepting of that possibility than the average joe, maybe too much. But they consider it their duty. 2020 will just be another year to some archeologist in 4020.

Sadly, slavery is not as much of a ""replaceable"" practice as you'd think, not in this society. You may not like it, but I can safely say that you, personally, have benefitted from slave labour.

As for the other part: i think we have agreed that both men and conservatism are 2 constant factors. But why do you stop at those 2 if there's a third factor (being muslim) which seems to make the chance that you radicilize ten times as big? Why do YOU feel the need to defend that group?

Also: the fact that you're talking about Christian and atheist terrorists on top of that is the ultimate proof that you're defending your own world view and won't ever listen to the facts. They are nothing in comparison, You're comparing  an ideology which literally 'spreads through sword' vs one that says to turn you other cheek if someone slaps you.

Why do YOU make it suddenly about conservative men? Why are you stopping at that and are you refusing to narrow it down even more? Could it possibly be related to you gender and politics?

3756,"&gt; Have you ever heard of a common culture, or a national spirit?

its all emotional things that dont actually mean anything in real life mate. It's what you have in football match too, tribalism essentially. 

Also ''common culture'' is a very tricky one......Scots are very different in culture to English, yet they are ''same nation'' or something. Of course they are not, it was artificially started like that to keep it under London control. And its like that with vast majority of countries. Very very few ''nations'' are fully homogeneous, and where ''their nation'' ends and another one begins is completely subjective thing and depends on who is talking and of course who has the power. There are no rules or set parameters there 

&gt;And your claim suggests that, if a country stops existing, it will never exist again, wich is absolutely false, just look at the partitions of Poland, for crying out loud

Poland is a good example, because for 300 year period nobody saw it as a country (it was Russia, Prussia and Austria) and you would get into trouble for even suggesting it. So again, it was completely subjective thing that depend fully on who had the power and who wrote the rules.

In year 1921 Poland finallyquired that power themslves when their forces defeated Soviets in a brutal military battle near Warsaw, and that was the only reason why ''Poland'' returned as a country and nation. What you or anyone else thought about the subject meant nothing, Poland came back into existing because they had raw military power to punch in the face those who wanted to say otherwise. Had they lost that battle, you would be telling a completely different story right now and there would be no Poland. Hence my point. Guns and violence creates nations and countries , not some kind of ''national spirit'' or ''common culture'', all of that can be conjured up later and done however the one who has the power wants it to be",Latvia,/r/europe/comments/kcu6uq/what_percentage_of_europeans_believe_that_parts/gfwkiqw/,angryteabag,1608020801

Because men hate to be told the obvious: that they're the problem. 

&gt;Or are you arguing there is no radicalization problem within the muslim community?

Of course there are. And the problem pretty much exclusively affects conservative Muslim men, just like in any other case of radicalization. So we've got three variables, 2 of which apply to all terrorists (being male and conservative) and one of which doesn't (being religious) yet you focus exclusively on the one trait that's not shared by all terrorists. Why is that? I'll tell you: it's because you don't care as much about stopping terrorism as you care about incriminating Muslims. If you incriminate conservative men instead, you still incriminate every single Muslim terrorist and get the Christian and atheist ones on top of that.

First, not many Slavs died. Twice as many Slavs died as Jews at the hands of Nazi camps, executions, roundups, labor camps, and starvation. Again, not many. 

Second, the total number of Poles that died at camps exceeds 1.2 million. At least 3.3 million Soviet POWs died in death marches or camps (although most were killed in death marches). How on earth is stuffing humans in a shower ""mass-processed"" but not forcing humans to walk to death not ""mass processed""? Is 4.5 million too little for you?

3982,"Are you being intentionally stupid? Why would politicians use the Turkish version of the same word? Smyrna is literally the same word as Izmir and same goes for Trabzon/Trapezounta. Why wouldn't we use that word? For your information, we use the Hellenized versions of the names of pretty much every European City. We call Paris, Parisi and Berlin, Verolino. Does that mean that we claim the French and German capitals as our own? No. We just use the words we are familiar with and follow the rules of our language. Imagine being so insecure over a bunch of names that have the same root and an idea that died 100 years ago. Also, no politician actually claims those cities or anything that belongs to Turkey. That screaming you're describing is not a thing. You probably fell for Turkish propaganda. The occasional nationalist fool that screams that stuff on TV channels that no one watcheo has no power. Only one major politician fits that description but he still has not power over foreign affairs. I can't say the same for your side. Every two days, Erdogan, Çavuşoğlu and other high ranking government officials threaten with war. Please show me our president or prime minister doing the same, since you follow Greek TV. Take a good look at what your government is doing before yoy accuse ours of the same stuff.

You really picked the worst possible comparison. New Amsterdam was RENAMED New York. Izmir was not. Izmir is the same as Smyrna. It's the Turkish version of the same word.... Really dude, pick up a linguistics book! That argument only works for Istanbul but I'm pretty sure politicians call it that when they're abroad. Here, we're used to the old name.

You clearly have no idea what the Megali idea was.... I wonder why I keep talking to you.... You do realize that if what you said is correct, then we can accuse the Turkish side of not using the recognised names of the Greek cities? What stops me from saying that ""Our capital is pronounced Athena, not Atina! You're trying to recreate the Ottoman empire! It's Kriti, not Girit!"" Do you realize how stupid this sounds? Also may I remind you that some Turk actually wants to change the name of the Aegean sea because the name is too Greek for his liking? You're talking about us and the Megali Idea which isn't a thing but you excuse that? 

Smyrna was in Greek control about 100 years ago and there were many Greeks living there before the Turkish war of independence or whatever you call it. That is why I say it's only been 100 years. Unless you have forgotten...

My highness hasn't forgotten her tribe. 1) Those tribes are not a thing anymore. Nobody can divide modern Greece according to those tribes. The term Ionian is not correct anymore, unless you are referring to the Ionian Islands. Even then, nobody referes to the people living there as Ionians.
2) If we could still divide Greece according to those tribes, then I would be a Dorian. That means that not all of us would be Ionians. The term would be incorrect once more.

4012,"&gt; Earlier this month, Migration Minister Notis Mitarakis said in a news brief that more than half of the people arriving on the island of Lesvos from Turkey in November were from Somalia. The Minister said that out of a total of 214 migrants arriving on Lesvos during the previous month, 142 were from Somalia.
&gt; 
&gt; Somalis aided by Turkey to enter Greece
&gt; 
&gt; According to a joint report from Greece’s National Intelligence Service, Police and Coast Guard, the well-organized network transfers migrants from Somalia to Greece, via Istanbul.
&gt; 
&gt; More specifically, the network is said to involve the Turkish consulate in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, the City University of Mogadishu, and the Erdogan Hospital (also located in Mogadishu) as well as Turkish-based Islamic non-governmental organizations.
&gt; 
&gt; In order for Somali nationals to travel from Somalia to Istanbul they have to acquire a student or medical visa. This is obtained either by a fake diploma from the City University of Mogadishu or by false medical certificates from a hospital — incredibly, using the code name “Erdogan.”
&gt; 
&gt; One such certificate was recently found by Frontex executives in the possession of a Somali national. Invitations from Istanbul universities or certificates of hospitalization from Turkish hospitals are still required for the approval of the student or medical visa.
&gt; 
&gt; The report cites testimonies from illegal migrants, according to which Turkish soldiers from the Camp TURKSOM military base in Somalia approached English-speaking Somalis and instructed them on how to obtain a visa and a subsidized ticket for their trip to Istanbul.
&gt; 
&gt; The procedure is handled by an agency at a cost of 1,300-1,500 euros, including a plane ticket, which is allegedly subsidized by the Turkish state and costs about 100 euros.
&gt; “Come join our students and get a student visa for Turkey at reasonable prices and in a short time,” says a travel agency advertisement in Mogadishu.
&gt; 
&gt; Statements by Somali immigrants also indicate that the process is often assisted by two Islamic non-governmental organizations, one based in the United Kingdom and the other in Turkey. The report of the Greek security services states that these two organizations have been investigated in the past, and they are connected with the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that has good relations with Turkish President Erdogan.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon arrival in Istanbul, Somali migrants are welcomed by their compatriots. They are taken by van to city apartments, where they stay in groups of 15-20 people until their safe transportation to the west coast of Turkey can be organized.
&gt; 
&gt; From migrants’ testimonies, it appears that the networks of mainly Turkish and Syrian migrant traffickers direct the Somalis to Smyrna and Dekeli, from where the passage to Lesvos is easier.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Mitarakis, who cites the security services report, currently some 2,500 Somalis are in Izmir waiting for the proper conditions to cross over onto the Greek islands. Each individual passage to Lesvos and Chios costs from 500 to 800 euros.
&gt; 
&gt; Somali migrants testified before Greek authorities that Turkish police do not arrest them, unlike they do with migrants of other nationalities, due to the close cooperation between Turkey and Somalia.
&gt; 
&gt; “Anarchist groups” involved
&gt; 
&gt; The boats carrying Somalis to their illegal crossing to Greece are aided by Turkish Coast Guard boats. If the boats are detected by Frontex or Greek Coast Guard vessels, they are asked to return to Turkey. There have been occasions when the boats have capsized, and Turkey then of course accuses Greece of “sinking refugee boats.”
&gt; 
&gt; Once on Lesvos, there are international organizations and humanitarian non-governmental organizations that direct the migrants and instruct them to follow asylum-seeking procedures. According to the report, some of the people aiding the Somalis belong to migrant-trafficking networks — and even anarchist groups.
&gt; 
&gt; Four non-governmental organizations operating on Lesvos have been investigated recently by the Hellenic Police, the Hellenic Coast Guard and the National Intelligence Service for  aiding the illegal passage of migrants to Greece.
&gt; 
&gt; Turkey’s presence in Somalia
&gt; 
&gt; Turkey clearly has a strong foothold in Somalia, a fellow Muslim country. In September of 2017, Turkey established Camp TURKSOM, a large military base and a defense college in Mogadishu. It also serves as the base of a Turkish-Somali task force called “African Eagle.”
&gt; 
&gt; At Camp TURKSOM, Turkey ostensibly trains officers of the Somali Armed Forces in order for the country to build an independent military. Allegedly, at the Turkish-run army academy, cadets are also taught to sing Turkish military anthems.
&gt;

""Dear Leader, Who is a Perfect Incarnation of the Appearance that a Leader Should Have.""

That's one of the North Korean leader's official titles. Is it not strikingly reminiscent of a royal title? Contrast it with the somewhat ridiculous official title of QEII:

""Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Defender of the Faith""

Or the title of Napoleon III:

""By the Grace of God and the will of the Nation, Emperor of the French""

Other official title's of the North Korean leader are:

* Great Man, Who Descended From Heaven
* Great Sun of The Nation
* Beloved and Respected Leader
* Father of the People

4306,"What do you mean by hungrian museum culture? (Sorry I honestly don’t know this term)

Why we are focusing on the past rather than the future? That’s a good question which I could never answer fully. I think we focus on both. Since the kindom of hungary was formed around 1000 by stefan I., which indeed killed all our former pagan nomadic culture and made us a christian nation, we have been never in such a poor shape as a country as after WWI+II (maybe except the ottoman occupation, which lasted for 150 years in the 16-18th century). As every nation we have shameful periods in our history, and I would never deny that. 

But I don’t get why we disregard the future? We try to build our future with consideration of our past. I mean should we rather put a glass dome on the top of the castle like on the Reichstag building? The Palast der Republik, the parliament of the GDR in Berlin was demolished not so long ago due to “asbest concerns” and what did they (re)build in it’s place? the Berlin palace. Is this not the same?

We like to be nostalgic about the hungarian kingdom, because we were a great nation back then. It had it’s flaws of course but according to it’s place in history. Where nationalities did not matter, just if you are noble or peasant. And we created our own downfall when we started a nationalist movement against the austrians in the 1800s. Every nation in the multicultural kingdom of hungary wanted it’s own rights after that. So fuck us thats right.

I believe we are building on top of our history more than germany for example which does not look at it’s past, just that they were the evil guys in WWII and everything derives from that. And do you know what? You mentioned:“Picking the best elements, disregarding the worst” that’s how evolution works.
I will never deny what gruelsome things we might have done in the past, but I will ever look upon the great deeds we did to become a strong nation nonetheless. 

I think that’s the correct way - know your past, learn from it and build your future",,/r/europe/comments/kccn53/the_communist_deprussification_of_the_royal/gfugyl6/,SerIstvan,1607976764

4349,"The animus became reciprocal. Malta’s future would be shaped by two people who lived an olive grove apart. “There was this real sense that everything was hanging in the balance,” Andrew recalled. The Labourites, seeking to appeal to Malta’s less educated, non-Anglophone population, spoke of Daphne and the Europhiles as stuck-up globalists. Meanwhile, European governments fretted over what might happen if Labour returned to power. “They remembered Mintoff,” Andrew said. “They worried about the risk of having this sort of Trojan horse in the European Union.”

The Europhiles won, though by a slimmer margin than in any of the several other countries voting on E.U. membership that year. Daphne’s sons were in their teens. “She thought, This is it—we’re finally home,” Paul told me. Andrew joined the Model European Parliament at school; Matthew’s friends started studying and working on the Continent, as the stores in Valletta filled with new kinds of chocolates and trinkets and clothes. “The change is amazing, if you think about it—it’s like physically joining a landmass,” Paul said.

Daphne told her children that the threat of returning to systemic corruption was mitigated by supranational safeguards. “The draw was that we were joining a community of well-governed nations,” Paul said. But the inverse was also true; just as the E.U. purported to serve as a buffer against institutional backsliding, it also acquired the defects of its newest member states.

Refugees and migrants started arriving in Malta by boat from North Africa. Daphne defended the E.U.’s asylum law, as her countrymen advocated sinking the boats at sea. The phrase “Daphne sucks black cock” appeared in spray paint on a wall in Bidnija. Then the arson attacks began—on a human-rights lawyer’s car and on the cars of people who worked for a Jesuit refugee service. One of the Caruana Galizias’ dogs disappeared. Another was shot. Paul, who was in high school, returned home late one night to find that a group of men had tried to burn down the house. They had stacked Molotov cocktails in tires and set them alight against glass patio doors overlooking the valley.

Daphne’s sons attended university in Malta, then moved away. Matthew developed news apps for the Financial Times, then followed a girlfriend to Costa Rica, where he built Web sites for investigative-reporting outlets. Andrew joined Malta’s foreign service, and worked in embassies in Berlin and New Delhi. Paul moved to London and pursued a Ph.D. in economics.

Daphne’s world grew smaller, madder, more constricting. In a country that was ninety-five per cent Catholic and hadn’t legalized divorce, she wrote that she’d rather sip prosecco than go to church on Easter Sunday. “The harassment changes with technology,” she noted, shortly before her death. Fewer ranting phone calls to the house, fewer envelopes filled with shit. An old man sent typewritten letters, which Daphne shared with the boys: “I used to tell them, ‘Look, the crazy old man wrote again.’ And eventually he must have died, because they stopped.”

As the threats shifted online, devoted readers tried to help. A breeder of Neapolitan mastiffs gave her a new guard dog. But an aging bandit who lived nearby said that the dog was too easily won over with treats. “Signora, you need a goose,” he advised.

One day in March, 2008, when Matthew was in Bidnija, Daphne decided to set up a blog. She had grown frustrated with the editorial constraints at the local paper, so Matthew helped her create a WordPress site. Her first post, “Zero Tolerance for Corruption,” was a critique of the Labour Party leader which ran close to four thousand words. The post drew so much attention that the server crashed. Six days later, Malta held its general election. Labour lost.

Later that year, Joseph Muscat ascended to the role of Labour leader—a move that placed him back in Daphne’s crosshairs. He had reacted to Malta’s E.U. accession by reversing his position and becoming one of the Labour Party’s representatives to the European Parliament. Daphne vilified him, for this and other fumbles, in an increasingly vituperative tone. In his first month as Labour leader, she described him as a “cocky shrimp” who was “already proving that his party has promoted him beyond his abilities.” He was, she wrote, a “quintessential empty vessel,” his voice a “nasal whine, which makes him sound like a twerp protesting that he’s been waiting too long in the queue at a nightclub for a vodka-cranberry juice.” Muscat’s supporters were “sub-literate,” his wife’s behavior like that of “the worst sort of vulgar, common and pushy person,” she wrote. “And his aides—oh dear, his aides—don’t really have that much going on upstairs.” The Labour Party portrayed her as a partisan hack. But her attacks were indiscriminate; she once dedicated a post to her sudden realization that Muscat’s opponent—whom she also despised—bore a “truly astonishing resemblance” to a beluga whale.

Muscat set about trying to modernize the Party platform by making it socially liberal and Eurocentric, and in the next few years he won over many of Malta’s youth. He campaigned in favor of bringing women into the workforce and legalizing divorce, and—after a divorce bill narrowly passed, in 2011—he voiced support for gay rights.

In 2013, Muscat ran for Prime Minister on a pledge to reduce energy costs by at least twenty-five per cent, through the construction of a new power station near the island’s southern harbor. Malta’s electricity came from heavy fuel oil. Muscat’s proposed station would run on liquid natural gas, which is cheaper and cleaner. At a campaign event, a woman who lived near the old power station told him that her husband had died of cancer, and that eight of her grandchildren were asthmatic. “She brought tears to my eyes,” Muscat told the press. “Under my watch, I will close this cancer-and-asthma factory. We have to save these people. I don’t want to hear of one child who gets sick.”

By then, Daphne’s blog was getting more than half a million visitors each day—more than the population of Malta. The night before the election, a homicide detective named Keith Arnaud was sent to arrest Daphne at home. Under Maltese law, news outlets were prohibited from publishing election-related content within twenty-four hours of a vote, and Daphne had just mocked Muscat on her blog. Upon her release, she told reporters, “You don’t expect to be in an E.U. member state and have the police investigating and interrogating people for writing about politics on the Internet.”

The next morning, Labour won the election by the widest margin in post-colonial Maltese history, and Muscat became Prime Minister. He was thirty-nine.

In early 2016, Matthew was living in Berlin, working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on an unprecedented data leak. Someone with access to the e-mail servers at Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian legal firm, had turned over to reporters more than eleven million documents exposing the inner workings of the global offshore financial system. The resulting investigations of the documents, known as the Panama Papers, triggered protests and money-laundering inquiries on six continents. “This is how most money in the world is stored, and how it flows,” Matthew said. “Offshore banking, offshore shell companies, offshore accountancy firms. Underground rivers. When you see a bank branch on the side of the road, what you’re looking at is really just the hair on the top of the head.” Under Muscat’s leadership, Malta had become an epicenter of such activity, drawing in vast sums of foreign money while turning a blind eye to its provenance.

The I.C.I.J. partnered with more than a hundred journalists from eighty countries to sort through the information. But Matthew, who reviewed the files after he was hired to build the Web site for the project, advised the consortium against sharing documents with Maltese reporters. “I identified very early on that the managing director of the Times of Malta was in a criminal relationship with Keith Schembri,” Muscat’s chief of staff, he told me. “It was a classic kickback scheme.” Schembri, who owned a printing-and-paper company, overcharged the Times for services, and directed a portion of the profits to a shell company owned by the newspaper’s managing director. (The director, who resigned soon afterward, denies any wrongdoing.)

Matthew called his mother and told her that he had discovered in the data that Schembri had a shell company of his own. So did Muscat’s energy minister, Konrad Mizzi, who was now in charge of the power-station project that had been central to the Labour Party’s campaign. A Maltese accountant had begun setting up the companies in Panama five days after Muscat won.

Daphne had felt for years that the power station made no sense. The previous government had approved the construction of an undersea cable to Sicily, which now connected Malta directly to the European power grid. Muscat’s power station, she thought, was superfluous, costly, and unreliable—and was likely set up as a kind of cover for distributing taxpayer funds to political allies and friends. “In Malta we take it for granted that people and businesses finance political parties so as to have their ‘stooge’ in government and get a return on their investment,” she had written a few months after the election. “Elsewhere, this is called corruption.”

Matthew asked his mother to remain quiet until April, when the I.C.I.J. planned to release the Panama Papers. But, in early February, after a tense encounter with Mizzi, the energy minister, she posted a cryptic note about members of the Labour Party wearing Panama hats. A leak turned into a flood of new tips. Then the dam began to break.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/kd5jgy/murder_in_malta/gfui0v4/,but_what_about_3G,1607977261

4499,"&gt;Taxing pensions is a thing for example, and if these old pensions were taxed more highly I don't see how that would go against anyone's rights.

There have been a number of reductions and taxes on pensions based on their amount, plus most pensions are automatically reduced since they are not fully adjusted to inflation. More cuts are planned, but taxation in Italy should conform to the constitutional principle of proportionality, taxing an income more simply because it was granted before one that is the same doesn't follow that. It is about the money given out in the past indeed, because those people received money for many years from the State instead of giving it as taxes, right in the prime of their working years; this has left a big gap in productivity and there is no way of taking that money back or reducing those pensions without bankrupting those people. The problem is not that the pensions are too high but that too many were granted when unwarranted, but now they are warranted as those people are older and you can't leave them with no income.

&gt;""the neoliberals ordered"" So what, you disagree with this?

I don't disagree with it, but it was them who did it. So it's a ""neoliberal policy"" that was indeed implemented in Italy, together with many others. However the problems I described above arise, because policy based on cold numbers and economical analysis usually ignores the actual facts and situations of the people, and it's mostly useless.

&gt;Taxes can be evaded yes but if Italy has one of the highest state spending levels it also must have have one of the highest tax collection levels even with tax evasion.

Unfortunately if the perpetrators are dead, their children are dead and their grandchildren are dead or almost dead, the only things we can do is to give state support - may I remind you the World Bank hilighted the UK as the only country to continue meeting its obligations to the world's poorest during this crisis - and that's that.

Do the British compensate Guangzhou for opium and then have Guangzhouren compensate Hong Kongers for taking away their freedom, and then have Hong Kongers compensate Xinjiang for buying from companies using Uyghur labour, and then make Uyghurs compensate Hui for attacking them, and then and then and then ad infinitum.

Many of the manufacturing processes for those products are now automated. There are far fewer ""slave-like conditions"" than there were 40 years ago, hence why salaries of the median Chinese person have grown faster than practically anywhere on the planet over the last 3 decades.

&gt; i don't agree on chinese goods being reliable to be honest, that's cheap, shoddy stuff that you don't know how long it will work or if at all. 

A lazy trope from the 1990s. If they were that unreliable why would they be so popular on a global level? After all, buying cheap can often mean buying twice or thrice, which may ultimately be more expensive.

I'll grant you there's some historical prestige around meeting a royal vs a president but that's just part of the outdated beliefs. If there were no monarchies there would be no perception that they're somehow more prestigious.

4906,"&gt;In a decision dated December 7, 2016, Italy’s Supreme Court – the *Corte di Cassazione*  – confirmed that the dismissal of an individual employee for redundancy  can be legally grounded solely on business-related reasons, such as  improving the company’s competitiveness, reducing costs, or increasing  profits. The decision was based on the constitutional principle of  “freedom of private enterprise.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite many significant labour law reforms in Italy in the past  couple of years, **the definition and rules regarding redundancy  dismissals date back to 1966, and have never been changed.** This type of  dismissal, unlike dismissals for serious misconduct (so-called “just  cause” dismissals), is based on “reasons related to productive activity,  work organization and its regular functionality.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The burden of proof in the event of a dispute regarding the validity of a redundancy dismissal will always be on the company.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although there is no statutory requirement that the company  demonstrate that the dismissal was required to avoid a crisis situation  or prevent the negative economic health of the company, a stream of  Italian case law decisions held that in order for the company to  demonstrate the validity of an individual redundancy dismissal it had to  prove “the need to tackle unfavourable **and not transitional economic  trends of the company.**” The recent decision of the Supreme Court, as  well as a series of other recent decisions, **indicate a shift away from  this approach by clarifying that while the court will check whether the  reasons listed in the dismissal letter are true, it is not permitted to  scrutinize the reasonableness or correctness of the economic or business  reasons upon which the company grounded the dismissal.**

The incident involves an individual who is a secretary at the office of the Turkish consul in the city of Rhodes, and another one, who was a chef on a ferry that was conducting local routes between Rhodes and Kastellorizo.

According to Greece’s Kathimerini daily, the chef was allegedly taking photographs of Greek warships, soldiers, and other military sensitive information in the broader area of Rhodes, following orders from the Consulate’s secretary.

He was then sending this information to the Turkish consulate of the island, in an obvious attempt to spy against the country.

4942,"&gt; Currency speculators at some of the hedge funds in Mayfair may be feeling quietly pleased. Trade experts will be relieved that their lucrative consultancy gigs will keep on coming. Heck, even financial columnists can safely pontificate about the possible outcome for a while yet, while the FBPE mob on Twitter can carry on predicting the apocalypse every time Nissan adjusts its production schedules. There are a few people for whom today’s agreement between Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to carry on discussing a trade deal will come as a relief. For the wider economy, however, it is little short of a disaster.

&gt; It is hard to know exactly what there is still to discuss between Britain and the EU. Four years after the referendum, and heading towards its fifth anniversary, there can hardly be a wrinkle on level-playing fields, a species of fish, or a sub-clause on regulatory alignment, dynamic or otherwise, that hasn’t been discussed in exhaustive detail. Even so, the two sides have agreed to carry on talking. And at this rate, maybe they will carry on through January and February as well.

&gt; Sure, most businesses would prefer a deal with the EU. Tariffs and quotas don’t help anyone, and neither do queues of lorries at Calais and Dover. If we can get a free trade agreement with the rest of the continent, then so much the better. Even so, that doesn’t mean that it is worth discussing it forever and forever. Here’s why.

&gt; First, it simply prolongs the uncertainty. That is fine for the hedge funds who can bet on the outcome one way or another (although it is worth noting the currency markets are so bored by the whole thing they hardly move anymore). That simply makes it more difficult for any company to plan ahead. Whether there is a deal or not, adjustments need to be made to stocks and supply lines. At a certain point, it is better just to know what needs to be done and get on with it. Next, and more seriously, companies also have to plan for two outcomes, deal or no deal. You don’t need to be a genius at maths to work out that doubles the cost. Finally, with no deal already priced into sterling, and with most companies having already been forced to make preparations, there is vanishingly little upside left to a free trade agreement anyway. Our negotiators are discussing margins within margins. As the months go by, less and less is a stake.

&gt; In truth, there is a hit to the UK economy from not reaching a deal with the EU. But at this stage it is relatively minor. The costs have already been absorbed. There may be some political benefits to continuing the talks, but the economic advantages have already evaporated. It would be better to move on with building a post-EU economy rather than dragging on the discussions indefinitely.","Glory to you, Putin our saviour",/r/europe/comments/kctsge/more_brexit_talks_are_the_worst_possible_outcome/gfslys9/,coffeebiscuitsandtea,1607934464

4946,"&gt; Given your own Chinese heritage, are you a supporter of the monarchy and what it represents?

Absolutely, yes, I'll take consitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with its checks and balances over a Presidential system any day (revolution and a republic did *not* end well in China). The British crown in particular historically had strong Chinese loyalty, in Malaysia and Singapore they were known as 'the King's Chinese' because of their support for British rule over local Malay Islamic despots. London was no different to Beijing in many ways in terms of being so far away and having a different language and ethnicity (Qings were Manchu, not Han), and the Chinese, like other communities like the Parsis in India, prospered immensely under Britain as a mercantile community with a strong emphasis on education and the importance of the law. And so to the present day, the monarchy is not perfect but it works very well as a system of checks/balances, it helps keep the State apolitical, separates power into three branches (state, government and legislature) and is a link with our past and history/traditions here in the UK. Again, the Chinese community as immigrants in the UK tend to raise their children to be very 'British' (there was a good post on AskUK a while ago from another BBC born there in the 60s talking of being raised as a 'patriotic Englishman') partially deliberately and partially accidentally so I do feel a strong connection to this country and its culture and I'd be sad to see that homogenised. China has been utterly homogenised by communism (it had a movement to 'get rid of the four old things': habits, thought, culture, behaviour and now almost nothing of its traditional culture, architecture, habits, social organisation remains compared to our neighbours).",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/kc6hja/queen_elizabeth_ii_who_is_on_the_throne_for_68/gfsm0q5/,palishkoto,1607934517

5020,"&gt;And tbh, it’s well known about the other peoples slaughtered by the nazis. More Russians died than Jews.

This is not true... It's very well known jews were systematicaly exterminated on an industrial scale, but the Genocide and Generalplan OST are barely known in comparrison, and the post war exodus and revenge murder of ethnic Germans who either lived as diaspora for a century or got resetled duting the war, is even less known. 

The reason is simple, makes sense and does indeed show the true state of things. The U.S and Britain, had the most cultural influence on the western world for all of the post WW2/Cold war period and even today. A great many jewish people settled in the U.S, and these people wanted their story to be told and told it. 

The exodus and revenge killings of Germans would stand in stark contrast with that and garner sympathy for Germans and possibly Nazi ideology(that was the fear), so the information was supressed.

In the same way information about the genocide on Slavic people was supressed, especially in the first decades of the cold war, the Slavic peoples of Europe were communist, and communism was the next great threat, portraying them as monsters rather than victims was state policy. 

The trend is changing today but still continues, and the result of more knowledge about the truths regarding the suffering of the Germans and Slavs(as a wider ethnic group) durring and after WW2, indeed brought on that which the western capitalist democracies were trying to prevent, which is sympathy for the communist and nazi sides and creating gaping divisions among the populace.

Nonetheless, the most widely known atrocity is the Holochaust, while the other larger atrocities aren't well known, and often times, are not known at all.

On a side note, the industriized nature of the Holochaust doesn't change much in terms of brutality.
Whether you have people herded into gas chambers and gassed, or entire vilages of people jammed into a wooden church and set on fire to burn them alive(as it was done in the Soviet union) can you really measure which was worse?

Additionally, when people hear Holochaust, they think mostly about the genocide against jewish people, not thinking of Polish, Yugoslav or other Slavic people who were exterminated in the same manner inside the same camps camps.",,/r/europe/comments/kccn53/the_communist_deprussification_of_the_royal/gfsdyu3/,YourLovelyMother,1607927106

&gt;Sharp rocks and ice and snow no man can stand

the only thing sharp here is the mountains. the rocks on the shore are smooth from weathering. there’s little ice since there’s little fresh water, the sea water is kept liquid due to ocean currents and salt concentraition. there’s snow, but not alot, just usually a dusting since there’s not alot of precipitation to begin with.

&gt;Blistering winds and darkness

this is the only ones that are true. during the winter months there’s no sun in the sky making the brightest moments during the day when the sun almost rises. but it’s only a partial truth, as in summer there’s constant daylight. Blistering winds is true throughtout all of winter.

""calls upon the Government of Armenia to use its influence to achieve  compliance by the Armenians of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the  Republic of Azerbaijan with resolutions 822, 853 and 874 ""

Oh yeah, no mention of this region at all. It is not like its right there introduction of the document.

\&gt;  Expressing its serious concern that a continuation of the conflict in and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic, and of the tensions between the Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijani Republic, would endanger peace and security in the region

Oh...karabakh is named explicitly, whoops.

\&gt;  Reaffirming also the inviolability of international borders and the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territory 

Ok, that's invasion, but they didn't SAY invasion, still good

So using arms to further military gains is not...invasion? What is it, a peaceful concert?

Forming a breakaway rogue state (by definition) with an armed force and help of an outside country is what exactly? An opera?

Oh it is invasion by definition? And that region is named explicitly? But it doesn't fit the genocide narrative. So..just dishonesty then? That is what I thought.

If you read the news in Brazil or France (I say Brazil because I live here atm, but the same applies to Spain or Argentina or Italy and so on), the US-UK are collectively referred to as ""Anglo Saxons"" sometimes, but in the actual USA and UK this term has fallen out of fashion (when used to describe themselves in the present day) because it has connotations with racism and such. Nowadays, Anglo-Saxon is used almost exclusively when referring to the culture that existed between the 6th century and the 11th century.


I've also noticed that modern day English-language media tends to downplay the Anglo-Saxons, even portraying them as weaklings and cannon-fodder to be slaughtered by others. The Vikings TV show uses them as props for the Viking supermen to cut down, the new Assassin's Creed game portrays Alfred the Great as a bad guy, there is zero ""Anglo-Saxon"" merchandise or branding (whereas the Graeco-Romans or Vikings are always used to advertise products or costumes), etc.



Maybe it's because I am a fan of JRR Tolkien, who was a Saxon enthusiast, but I've found it quite weird how their cultural legacy in today's English speaking world is so often forgotten and generally ignored.

5254,"No, they weren't done by Russian forces, read them again. One was with Russian help, nothing more. 

Sumgait and Baku massacres happened before the war. 

Armenia is not mentioned as occupyting force. 

"" *Forming a breakaway rogue state* "" has happened via lawful referendum, which Azerbaijan illegally didn't accept. As a autonomous outblast, NK had the right to break away as per Sovier law. It was only after Azerbaijan started massacres that force was used. Force for defense, not invasion.

No one says those massacres were a genocide. Aside from Azerbaijan which claims that killing 200 people in a war was. 

Now lets analyse the four links you mentioned: 

1. [March\_Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_Days) happened in a course of WWI. And they were followed by [September\_Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_Days), also during the WWI. 
2. But you know what massacre didn;t occur during WWI and killed 20  000 Armenians? [Shusha\_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha_massacre).
3.  [violence\_in\_Shusha\_and\_Stepanakert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_violence_in_Shusha_and_Stepanakert) killed one Armenian, wounded 33 Armenians and 16 Azerbaijanis. Why would it be on the list of Armenians made massacres? 
4.  [Fanis\_Ayrum#Capture\_and\_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C4%9Fanis_Ayrum#Capture_and_massacre) page has only Azerbaijani propaganda outlets as sources and wasn't confirmed by any other source. And no, hat one New Yorker source doesn;t talk about any massacre, only about the village being captured later.
5. [Black\_January](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_January) was  - as is written in your own link that you claim you read - done by Russians. Not Armenians.

Konrad Adenauer was a practicing Catholic (and leader of the *Christian* Democrats), as was Robert Schuman https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schuman#European_politics

&gt;Schuman was a Christian Democrat (Popular Republican Movement) political thinker and activist. Twice Prime Minister of France, a reformist Minister of Finance and a Foreign Minister, he was instrumental in building postwar European and trans-Atlantic institutions and was one of the founders of the European Union, the Council of Europe and NATO.[1] The 1964–1965 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.

&gt;Schuman was intensely religious and a Bible scholar.[14] He commended the writings of Pope Pius XII, who condemned both fascism and communism but whose leadership of the Catholic Church during the war remain the subject of controversy, including allegations of public silence and inaction about the fate of the Jews.[15] He was an expert in mediaeval philosophy,[14] especially the writings of St Thomas Aquinas,[16] and he thought highly of the philosopher Jacques Maritain, a contemporary.[17]

No he wasnt. This is a common misconception that betrays your obvious ignorance of history

The nazi party won a minority of seats in the reichstag leading up to Hitler seizing power. At no point did those electoral victories lead to Hitler taking any elected position. The nazi party took power when Hitler was *appointed* by Hidenberg.

They bring in money from tourism. I'm also not sure democratically elected leaders are known for their frugality. 

&gt;perpetuate outdated beliefs, 

Constitutional monarchy is much newer than Democracy, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with a belief being old. 

&gt;their lack of power means they're completely unnecessary. 

There are a few cosmetic monarchies, but the English one certainly isn't. The Queen has quite a bit of power. 

&gt;And if they did have power that would be anti-democratic

The majority of people like the Queen. 

Having an 'anti democratic' system is can good thing. Hitler was put into power via democracy. It's the classic quote, ""The best argument against democracy is a 5 minute conversation with the average voter"".

I believe in a system where there are three branches of government, like the U.S. One is Congress, which would be made up of representatives elected from each state, The Supreme Court (Instead of being appointed, they would be proposed to the public and would need a 60% majority to enter), and finally the President, which would be a hereditary position.  
The three branches would have equal power. One is pure democracy, one is monarchy, and the third is a mixture of the two. 

This system would keep the political divisiveness down, while still giving areas a democratically elected voice in the government.",,/r/europe/comments/kc6hja/queen_elizabeth_ii_who_is_on_the_throne_for_68/gfrd8k5/,GigaVacinator,1607905126

5655,"&gt; SUMMARY: For Johnson, it meant a festival of xenophobia: first insulting the French, then threatening to use gunboats to fight EU fishermen, and finally causing deep offence to Angela Merkel and the German people. If Britain and the EU are to allow unfettered access to each other’s markets, then there must be mechanisms in place to prevent undercutting – whether it takes the form of a race to the bottom in stripping workers’ rights and environmental protections, or artificially lowering the costs of production with direct or indirect state subsidies. In truth, English fishermen sold off their quotas to foreign operators in the 1990s – in contrast to Scotland where 96% remains in Scottish hands. It is the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that requires Britain to negotiate access to its waters for its neighbours – and there is little chance that a politically and economically significant trade deal will be scuppered over fishing.",,/r/europe/comments/kcfjkw/never_mind_the_brexit_deadline_drama_the_shape_of/gfq0855/,Pessimist2020,1607883523

No, they were withdrawn after almost **2 decades** of being in Turkey for free. Nice gratitude towards the alliance, especially the US, Germany, and the Netherlands.

You are simply repeating propaganda. The Patriot and European Aster missiles were offered for **decades** again before the S400 was purchased.

I suggest you read a CAATSA and what it says. It's not an ""excuse"", it is a US law passed with overwhelming support in Congress (98–2 in the Senate, 419–3 in the House). You were warned, you ignored, so stop whining about the repercussions. 

&gt;Your hate of Turks is not about Erdogan either. 

It isn't about Erdogan alone, that you're correct about. Aggression, international and human rights violations are a staple of every Turkish government. 

&gt;your European masters were praising him to be this new muslim champion

You realize he's been supported by your countrymen over the past 18 years, correct, damn any ""praising"" done by any actors outside your country? Unless your argument is that his voters support him because he was or is ""praised"" by ""European masters"".

As for having a ""master"", that is something only an Ottoman ancestry could entertain (imagine having an identity of your ruling family). You can't even insult your master Ergodan or your long dead previous master without ending up in prison. *""To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize"".*

&gt;It is fun to see you Greeks sobered up by realpolitik. 

I don't think any Greek or frankly any neighbor of Turkey not being pragmatic about realpolitik. Turkey is the cheap labor market for many European manufacturers and have a huge investment exposure there. Those countries will never move a finger unless forced to by the US (and even then to a certain degree).",,/r/europe/comments/kayyxo/merkel_and_borissov_blocked_eu_sanctions_against/gfq08b2/,GeorgePapadopoulos,1607883525

&gt;U.S. investors understand the power of disruption

Yes, and we are all paying for that disruption now with companies like Google, Facebook, AirBnB, Uber, Amazon, Twitter and more creating all kinds of issues. Which also prevent competitors from entering the market, which is a good reason you see less European tech companies. Good luck competing with Amazon when they decide to just rip all your data, sell at a loss for years and wait for you to go bankrupt. Good luck competing with Google if the default search engine is mandated to be them on a ton of devices.

The answer right now is not that Europe needs ""to do better.""

Yeah... so even this study that u cited to prove that ""it's not so bad for gay ppl in Poland"" says that we are far worse than EU on average lol

You literally cherry-picked a data from the survey that is supporting your viewpoint. After just looking briefly at the report, Poland WAS IN 2014 still one of the worst places in Europe according to this study. You might be saying that it was only ""few percent"" more than certain countries u put as comparison, but the constant is - Poland was doing worse than EU average.

Like, you can cherry-pick a data, then made an argument that there is openness for being LGBT in Poland, and then a data suggesting otherwise you simply explained with ""people being a snowflake"" (as if not constant homophobic remarks could make someone scared of coming out).

If your takeaway from that study is that ""it's not so bad"" when it constantly  put Poland in top 5 worst countries for LGBT people in EU... then i think you simply looked at it with your mind already made up.

AND NOW

THE CRUCIAL PART

You compare a data from 2014 to make an argument about situation of LGBT people in Poland in 2020. So basically, this data ignores the impact of comments like ""these people are not equal to normal people"" of Czarnek or president of the country calling LGBT an ideology or the entire hate propaganda of church, the LGBT-ideology free zones etc.

So you literally a cited a study from 2014, when propaganda surrounding LGBT came in after PiS came into power (after 2015)... EVEN THOUGH THIS STUDY STILL PLACES POLAND AS ONE OF THE WORST COUNTRIES FOR LGBT IN EU (regarding violence, offensive language of politicians, holding hands in public, avoiding certain places at fear of being harassed etc.)",,/r/europe/comments/k94acg/french_europe_minister_comes_out_as_gay_will/gfpjmq0/,futurerank1,1607876048

It's in the UK's interest to go along with proceeding to avoid playing into the EU's hands and getting even more negative press.

The truth remains that the UK is asking for nothing that it wouldn't be perfectly reasonable for any other 3rd nation like Canada or Japan to ask for. If the EU wants tariffs, so be it. If the EU doesn't want easy financial services across borders, so be it. 

This has been the UK's position for ages. We don't care what it costs, we want to be entirely a 3rd nation like Japan or Canada. If we can reach an agreement that beats WTO rules, great, but rather WTO than give the EU any special power in UK law or access to fishing waters. 

Furthermore, the UK has shown good faith by signing the withdrawal agreement and agreeing to put the sea border inside its own territory for the good of Ireland.

Eventually, Europeans are going to wake up to this reality and realise the EU actively wants no-deal as their way of punishing the UK for leaving. 

When job losses occur in Europe due to trade with the UK falling under WTO rules, people might do enough research to realise that the EU are no the bastion of holiness many media outlets have presented them with and they've been creating a no-deal outcome from the start.

She has to accept a majority Prime Minister, but if no majority/coalition is formed, then she theoretically could appoint someone besides the choice of the largest party.

She also has the ability to, in theory, to unilaterally dismiss the Prime Minister, although the last time that happened. Until 2011, she had the power to dissolve Parliament as a whole, but she retains the power of ""Prorogation,"" which allows her to force Parliament to be out of session for specific period of time.

There is also the concept of the ""royal prerogative,"" which theoretically rests most executive power in her, but effectively hands that over to the Prime Minister.

5859,"&gt; This is the article. It goes on and on about how there is having sex with men, and being gay. It asserts that being gay is a distinct ideology with its own culture, and that having sex with men doesn't make one gay.

CTRL+F ""ideology"", results:


&gt; Some Republicans and media portrayed Thiel’s statement as progress: The party had embraced an out gay man, and the convention **had reflected the diverse ideological identities of LGBT Americans**.

&gt; **This does not mean that LGBT culture is homogenous or that all LGBT people have the same ideological viewpoints or values**, but it does mean that they all understand, on some level, the notion of gay culture.

and this after reading the article:

&gt; contrary to conventional wisdom that LGBT people rejected religious institutions, many founded their own churches and synagogues and sought refuge in worship.



Yeah, this article goes exactly against your own words. This article doesn't connect LGBT with any kind of ideology and elaborates on completely different issue. You really though I would not read it or are you a special kind of stupid? Try your bullshit elsewhere, where people might actually believe in your raving.






&gt; That's not the opinion of many gay people of the sort that wrote the article. It's not an uncommon sentiment among people who consider themselves a part of the ""LGBT community"".

Did I fucking stutter?


&gt;  but it's non the less a fact that this is how many people see themselves.

Nah, it's like you and others see those people.



&gt; The opposition to the LGBT ideology (...)

LGBT what? There isn't such thing as LGBT ideology. Deal with it.

&gt; Like I said, when we talk about LGBT as simple descriptions of sexual orientation, this is absolutely true. But this term is something that had been coopted to create an ideology that comes with many political implications. 


Nope. It's a substitute term for just ""LGBT"", but adding ideology makes it easier to attack and decieve citizens as if it wasn't about the people. So according to this when you're not attacking people (especially for your own gains, likely political), then you aren't doing anything wrong. It's hiding your own malice and bigotry. Your bullshit will not work here.



&gt; Wanting to be left alone is one thing. However, as many LGBT writers insist, LGBT isn't just a sexual orientation.

Doesn't matter, LGBT is by definition about sexuality and gender identity.

&gt;  It's a system of beliefs that seeks to restructure society in accordance with radical leftist politics.

Actual, real definition:

&gt;  LGBT, or GLBT, is an initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB, which began to replace the term gay in reference to the broader LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. The initialism, as well as some of its common variants, **functions as an umbrella term for sexuality and gender identity.**

Treat your delusions at psychiatrist. 






&gt; I can hear them fuck sometimes.

With your head, I suppose.


&gt; you got detracted 

Except I didn't.  If you don't have arguments then say so, instead of forcing your bullshit narrative.

&gt; and talked about how opposition to LGBT is an ideology,

Oh, so pointing out the irony, hypocrisy and lies then explaining LGBT doesn't have anything to do with ideology is now detraction. Or maybe you got caught on your bullshit and couldn't muster a single argument?

Sounds like way more probable option, since you already did that in my previous comment when it would crumble your narrative completely.


&gt; and your opinion on gender roles,

Also not my opinion.

Brexit, from the beginning, has been led by the ERG party and their constant screams of betrayal and ideological purity. It's the XXI century version of the communists who said that communism is a good idea which unfortunately was badly executed by the Soviet Union.

5978,"&gt; They could shoot it down either by themselves (to obviously blame Russia)

Conspiracy. Here is what the actual investigation led to:

&gt; The Public Prosecution Service (OM) alleges Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov, Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko obtained and deployed the BUK TELAR at the firing location with the aim of shooting down an aircraft.

Three out of four are Russian citizens and military men.

Why would they make an exception for the UK, especially when those who campaigned couldn’t be honest with the voters that they wanted to have a no deal Brexit since 2010. Even before David Cameron agreed to the 2016 referendum. They wouldn’t have won would they. I didn’t fall for the lies and the Boris the Buffoon act.
