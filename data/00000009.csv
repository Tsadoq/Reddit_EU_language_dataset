If  you just wrote that US life expectancy is not drastically lower than the European countries and left it there - I'd left it there. But then you wrote all that barely related stuff and that is what has spiked my k interest/ suspicion/ concerns.

* I haven't actually claimed ""drastically"", I have claimed lower, which [CDC seems to confirm](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2488300?resultClick=3), or [even this map on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2kqq03/life_expectancy_in_europe_vs_usa/) - decade old though
* The paper you are referring to comes from a series of two ([1](https://repository.upenn.edu/psc_working_papers/13/), [2](https://repository.upenn.edu/psc_working_papers/11/)) basically on the same topic, both from 2009, both same authors. They claim they are peer review. Reading through them - I feel like reading those studies proving that Global Warming doesn't exist. First you setup very tight constrains and then you tighten them even further until you get what you want. The Abstract is IMHO misleading. What the study really proves is that if money is not an object, The USA has the best healthcare in the world. Again - I don't deny /dispute that. The issue here is that none of the studies takes in account affordability of those prostate cancer tests and if you didn't take the test  - you won't show up in the statistics. Affordability [seems to be an issue with prostate cancer tests](https://health.costhelper.com/prostate-cancer.html)
* Another strange thing is the Forbes article. I just don't understand. Can anybody explain meaning of the second sentence here?

&gt;A number of mathematically astute readers have asked why some countries have increased average life expectancies once you take out fatal injuries. I asked Robert Ohsfeldt about this, who responded that the adjustment factor was based on fatal injury rates relative to the average.

Also, in the only version of the presentation I've found (se below) lacks the ""adjustment"" you (and the Forbes article) are talking about.

The original link to Mr. Ohsfeldts work doesn't work, but is [still available at archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20111215210009/http://www.aei.org/files/2006/10/17/20061017_OhsfeldtSchneiderPresentation.pdf) and is nothing more than a Powerpoint presentation full of questionable arguments like ""we can take the cost because we have the coresponding GDP"" (interpreted) - no mention about how the income gets distributed around the nation.

Finally there are pet peeves like

* all the referred material is pre Opioid crysis
* if you remove minorities and immigrants from the US population in order to improve life expectancy you are no longer talking about the map/ comparison above

I live in Prague CZ. All of the Americans I've talked about it - and it is a really popular topic - are positive about our healthcare system. It is in no way perfect (famously - the food sucks), if you really feel you need preferential car you can pay for it but it won't leave you hanging - no matter what. Even if you are homeless, even if you aren't citizen. When it does even by accident, somebody is going to loose a job or better yet -  go to jail.

My English is limited, this is a really complicated subject I've already spent on it much more time than I would prefer - but no matter how I look at it the US heath care system still seems to be [the Elephant in the room](https://ourworldindata.org/us-life-expectancy-low)..",,/r/europe/comments/ogcjtg/average_age_in_us_and_eu/h4s8sb1/,BarkingDialectics,1625984907

502,"If that's what you've been telling your family then you have a rather limited understanding of Dutch politics. 

The voting base of the VVD is on the affluent side and well educated. While you can question the morality of voting for him and his party, it certainly isn't a case of 'the stupidity of the average person' voting against their interest - leaving aside the oxymoronic nature of that statement, the vast majority of people who vote for the VVD do so in their genuine best interest.

Bear in mind the VVD even in the last election only got 22% of the votes, but that still makes them by far the largest party in our 17 party parliament (a record number).

He's by any measure an extremely gifted politician who only relatively recently really lost credibility with the majority of his colleagues, and that of a large share of the population.

And while his corona policies have been abysmal, embarrassingly enough they've consistently garnered support from a vast majority of political parties across the spectrum.

I know it sounds like I'm defending Rutte; I want him gone, both for his Corona policy, his completely loss of integrity and especially because of the damage his long reign has done to the opportunities for an increasingly large amount of people - but don't make the mistake of thinking his voting base is an ignorant bunch of people; it's incomparable to a republic party where people vote against their personal interest for ideological reasons.

542,"Russia is probably the world leader in short range air defense, and both Russia and China are leaders in hypersonic weapons. Why? Because short range air defense is a task that we have historically allocated to our air force, which is evident today in both numbers and quality of US/Western air forces vs. Eastern ones. 

Side note: Russia and Slavboos love parading the maps of Russian air denial but it's worth remembering that range of detection does not equate to range of engagement, particularly against stealth aircraft. 

What about hypersonic weapons? These new types of missiles arose from a need to defeat US medium and long range missile defense, a category in which we are the unquestioned leaders. BMD systems such as Aegis are now advanced enough that they represent a significant degradation of nuclear deterrence for smaller arsenals such as China's relatively limited supply of ICBMs capable of hitting the US mainland. The Defense Department understands the threat of hypersonics, and while we are late to the party we are now also developing our own missiles. 

The greater issue with Russia, however, is not their general bleeding edge technology ‚Äì it's that their economy is smaller than that of Italy's, and as a result they cannot actually buy and field much of their newest gear. News media may fearmonger about their vast numbers of tanks, or the new T-14 or Su-57 (the latter of which is likely not truly 5th generation), etc. but the fact is Russia's forces have a large discrepancy in what the latest technology is on paper and what troops are equipped with on the ground. 

But yes, Patriot had a rough start, S-300/S-400's latest variants are extremely competent and likely the best short range air defense, and currently Russia and China are ahead of the US in hypersonic weapons.

671,"There is a secluded section of the American cemetery in Oise-Aisne where just under 100 men are buried, all of whom were convicted and executed for various crimes. Some murdered their fellow soldiers, some committed rape (and usually murdered their victim), and some murdered civilians. 

The US Army did execute soldiers for crimes against enemy civilians if there was sufficient evidence. For example Louis Till (father of Emmmet Till) was tried and hanged along with Fred A McMurray for raping an Italian woman and murdering two others. 

One of the general assumptions why reported rapes were comparatively low was that allied servicemen from the western powers could generally barter for sex. Most of these people had spent years with adequate access to food (much less luxuries like good alcohol, sweets, joyrides in cars, and even nylon stockings), which left many young women well acquainted with the hard reality that sex can be a commodity- even if they didn‚Äôt offer themselves up during this period, they were likely propositioned or at least knew of someone who did. 

Between the relative abundance of western soldiers and the pent up desire for good times by a population who experienced years of rationing and reduced living standards, it wasn‚Äôt entirely implausible that finding a willing partner was easier than it normally would have been.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ohn4lf/while_you_are_away_nazi_propaganda_poster_dropped/h4qh75c/,Kahzootoh,1625947397

712,"Person to person, Scottish people and English people get on just fine.

When things switch to the level of Scotland and England, a lot of Scottish people feel misunderstood, poorly represented and ignored. So the more oblivious English people are to Scotland‚Äôs frustrations, the more aggravating that becomes.

Scottish people perceive English people as not understanding Scotland, their history, their identity and their culture. Scottish people often feel their voice is muted across the UK and do not have a fair say.

For example, Scotland sees itself as unique and distinct from England, but is often lumped in the same pot - one common accusation being that British identity, closer represents what being English means and doesn‚Äôt really include how being Scottish feels.

So, when it comes to UK media making a big song and dance about 1966 (almost on every terrestrial channel in all the countries across the UK, so difficult to avoid) it aggravates those feelings, as 1966 just is not a celebrated year for most Scottish folks. So it‚Äôs received by Scottish people as ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs important to England is important to Scotland‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs important to Scotland is not important to England‚Äù.

1966 being one example, there are multiple others.

After a while that grinds you down.

Scotland‚Äôs dislike for England says more about how Scotland sees itself.

It's about how the media is constructed in the UK. When you turn on a TV in the UK it's English TV you are watching. The wall to wall English people.


When Scotland or Wales weren't on this tournament. It was an English presenter, English commentary, English pundits. 


Everything is framed with regards England.


Imagine decades of this. I remember wanting England to do well in 1990. Decades later of listening to them taking about themselves to the rest of the UK as if they are the only ones in the room I don't.

Imagine that in a small percentage of people, the mRNA for some reason gets translated into DNA and inserted into you genome. From now on, you'd be producing spike proteins and your immune system would run wild. Or it would be inserted just at a random place and your chances of getting cancer would be much higher. To make it clear, this is not possible as our cells do not produce the reverse transcriptase enzyme that would be needed. 

Others believe the vaccine contains toxic substances. There is a little bit of substance as traditional vaccines contain so called [adjuvants](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html) that boost immune responses and the aluminium-based ones might not be the most healthy ones. Anti-vaxxers usually claim adjuvants are either mercury-based or cause Alzheimer in case of the aluminium compounds. It's not true, but the meme is out there.

My 82yo aunt simply believes that she gets fever and is ill for roughly a week after each and any vaccine, so she avoids them. I've been pleading with her to cut the nonsense (at her age, contracting COVID is likely to be worse), but she's too afraid and gets stubborn the more I talk to her.

That a society can come to reaslise some of what it's always done is wrong and change shows strength and confidence. And don't try to pretend Hungary is in the mainstream.

I can promise you one thing; at the end, Hungary will have the same percentage of gay people as places like NL or UK. The only difference being the misery the Hungarian kids have had to endure. I have one big Ace in this game: I grew up gay and you didn't. I had zero exposure to anything remotely ""gay"" as a kid, and was surrounded by culture promoting heterosexuality. It makes no difference, as gay people have no more control over their sexuality than black people do their skin. 

You wouldn't dare adopt overt racism as publicly stated ""value"", would you? Not that you need to. 

I can't ""force"" anything on Hungary. If the country wishes to parade its paranoia worldwide, then it should be expected that the more sophisticated countries shun it.

1020,"&gt;The biology teacher who claims to have been punished ""for teaching that there are only two sexes"" to his students of 1st ESO has filed a criminal complaint against the director of the public high school in Alcal√° de Henares IES Complutense where he taught and against the inspector of Education of the Community of Madrid who opened the file.

&gt;A biology teacher investigated for saying that there are only two sexes: ""It is scientific ""A biology teacher investigated for saying that there are only two sexes: ""It is scientific ""A biology teacher investigated for saying that there are only two sexes: ""It is scientific"".
Professors call for a plan to implement the Cel√°a law in the face of the ""science fiction"" of 2050
In the hand of the Christian Lawyers Association, Jesus Barron, so called the teacher, has filed a complaint Thursday before the Court of Instruction of Alcala de Henares against the two professionals for ""possible crime of prevarication with aggravated discrimination"".

&gt;Beyond the contentious-administrative route that is open until the Community of Madrid resolves the file opened against this teacher on May 31, for which he is provisionally removed from teaching and has reduced his salary by 600 euros by not collecting extra complement, Barr√≥n has turned to the criminal route.

&gt;According to the complaint, to which Vozp√≥puli has had access, the teacher explained a ""biological reality"" to the minors.

&gt;According to the complaint, to which Vozp√≥puli has had access, the teacher explained to the minors a ""biological reality"" such as the ""existence of two sexes, male and female, with their corresponding XY and XX chromosomes"", a teaching included in the usual didactic programming and for which he used didactic material ""proven and that had never caused any problem"".

&gt;The text indicates that Barr√≥n is an interim official of the Corps of Secondary Education teachers specializing in biology and geology and that as a professional of that body has exercised his functions in the IES Complutense de Alcal√° de Henares. ""He has always enjoyed the esteem of his colleagues and students, having been in the exercise of his teaching vocation an educator without blemish,"" says the letter.

&gt;Proven"" material from Editex
&gt;The complainant defends that he gave class to students of 1st of ESO within the usual didactic programming, concerning the topic The systems and apparatuses of vertebrate beings (section 9 of topic 9). ""In this topic, issues concerning human sexuality were discussed always within the biological perspective, with proven material that had never caused any problem; moreover, this material is within the sanctioning file and can be checked, it is from the Editex publishing house"", specifies the complaint.

&gt;In addition, the professor defends that the material ""not only does not contain polemic points, but that it is taxative in its defense of women and contrary to sexism and machismo and is respectful of the rights of the LGTBI collective"".

&gt;""What Jos√© Luis Barr√≥n L√≥pez defends is the biological reality of the existence of two sexes, male and female, with their corresponding XY and XX chromosomes. Something evident and within the logic of the subject, without the appearance of any ideology,"" the complaint highlights.

&gt;The Department of Education acknowledges having opened a file against the teacher ""due to the complaints of the families"".

&gt;According to the teacher's defense, as a result of the complaint ""from a student of whom we know nothing, since the file does not yet contain any charge sheet"", Barr√≥n has been subjected to an investigation which resulted in a Report of the Educational Inspection Service and the subsequent initiation of disciplinary proceedings.

&gt;The Ministry of Education of the Community of Madrid acknowledged Wednesday to have opened a file to the teacher, but defends that it was due to ""complaints from families"". ""There were complaints from families saying that they did not agree with the notes that were due in that class, with the teachings that occurred because they considered that they were not consistent with the curriculum of Biology,"" explained the counselor Enrique Ossorio after clarifying that the teacher had not been expelled nor had he been suspended from employment for six months. A different version to that of the complainant.

&gt;Suspended from employment
&gt;When something like this happens, Ossorio said, the Inspectorate goes to the center and checks what has happened. In view of the circumstances, the Inspectorate ""took a precautionary measure that consists of the teacher ceasing to teach, although his basic remuneration has been maintained"".

&gt;Christian Lawyers insists in denouncing that ""within the sanctioning file, the tremendous precautionary measure of suspension of employment and salary for six months, the maximum possible, has been imposed"".

&gt;And they add in the complaint that ""everything has been done in clear violation of the honor of the defendant, as well as with manifest ideological animosity, in a summary and persecutory manner"". ""The two defendants have shown from the very beginning an evident iniquity against the plaintiff, as can be seen in the open file and in the precautionary measure taken, both of which cannot be understood without an ideological persecution in the background"", they consider.

&gt;During the statement of the defendant made before the plaintiffs - the complaint points out - impertinent questions were asked on subjects that had nothing to do with the object of the interrogation, exclusively political and ideological questions, and in addition, during the interrogation the inspector even said that if one of her children were in the defendant's class she would go and report him to the police.

&gt;The teacher's right to honor
&gt;""The public image and the right to honor of the defendant have been irreparably damaged. Economically, a father of a family is deprived of his livelihood, a tremendous measure, which, if withdrawn, will oblige the administration to return all the money with interest,"" reads the document.

&gt;The teacher's defense alleges that the actions of both the director of the center and the inspector ""have violated his constitutional rights of effective judicial protection, academic freedom, freedom of expression and the right to information"".

&gt;In this way, he considers that both would have incurred in a crime of prevarication under Article 404 of the Penal Code with aggravating circumstance of discrimination, for having adopted this ""unfair"" decision knowing it to be so because of, allegedly, the ideology of the teacher.

‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ   Reckless is when a player acts  with disregard  to the danger to,   or  consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned 
‚Ä¢‚ÄÇ   Using excessive force is when  a player exceeds  the necessary use of force and/or  endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off""

The duke takes even more money from the people and orders building of something that is way to expensive, giving it's purpose - promoting humbleness and basic decency.

Mangart saddle, Slovenia  
Nature always has an upper hand. Uro≈° Fink and I started to plan and discuss this composition in December of 2020, but there were still many unknown factors in play - such as the accessibility of the location, because there was still snow on the road leading up to the saddle. In the past few years, the road got opened in mid May, but this year if feels like all four seasons shifted for a month. Also, July is the last month when a pano like this one is possible. Luckily, the road was cleared all the way on the very same day we decided to go, tho constant changes in weather forecast made us think we should postpone our trip for a day. But on the end we decided to give it a go, since the forecast for next day didn't promise any better conditions.  
When we parked the car, we were greeted with a few clouds (and a free coffee from the caretaker of the hut at the saddle). 
Wind was just relentless on our location - because of that, my original plan to use a star tracker was out of the window, so I had to do untracked panorama shots with my 35mm lens. I set my exposure time to 15 seconds. I knew this would give me some star trails, but that is not a problem if you are going for a huge panorama, becuase everything shrinks down (even the noise is not as visible). All in all it was absolutley great experience - it was great to meet Uro≈° in person for the first time after chatting online for quite some time now. I am also very very happy how this image turned out (this is in fact my first ""serious"" panorama).  
The road to the Mangartsko Sedlo is the highest-lying road in Slovenia, climbing up an elevation of 2,072 metres (6,798 feet) above the sea level. The Mangart Pass is located on the border between Italy and Slovenia in the Julian Alps.  
Mangart is the name of the mountain range between the Koritnica Valley and the Mangart Valley, with the highest peak Veliki Mangart (Big Mount Mangart - the mountain in the middle of the composition), 2,679 m (8,789 ft). Starting in Bovec, roads to get the summit are number 203 and number 902. Both have many switchbacks, tunnels, hairpins, and a wild average percent in many sections. According to several informations, this is the highest road in the country.

1251,"Simply provide sources for your claims and perhaps people would be more inclined to believe you. 

You are making wild claims that are contradictory to how MMF contributions work. You are also blaming free market activity on the EU. This has nothing to do with the EU. The U.K. uses the Crown Dependancies and the Caymans as a method to circumvent taxes. The funds you are blaming the EU for in fact exist because the British government permits them to.

Gabriel Zucman‚Äôs  Hidden Wealth do Nations is a good place to start. 

98% of money contributed by member states into the MMF is directly used to fund development projects in the EU, including the U.K. who received more than they paid over 40 years because this is how the MMF works. 1% is used to cover EU running costs and another 1% is used for wages and pensions. 

The U.K. is not the biggest contributor nor does it carry the weight of the EU. Total propaganda and a nationalistic fetish for the unintelligent who can‚Äôt be bothered to research and instead like to be spoon fed by angry shouting men in nice suits on the television. 

If you‚Äôre a troll then okay, this is just a fact of life now. If you‚Äôre being sincere then good grief, you‚Äôre actually one of the dumbest people I‚Äôve ever read a comment by on this subreddit.

Our constitutional court last year dismantled the main Anti-Corruption Law, just like that. Any law or institution can be dismantled. They did that because at least 4 judges including the head of the court had a conflict of interests.

From my personal experience, everything ""done later"", rarely happens at all, and anything temporary becomes permanent.

&gt;It can happen later on and would be easier to be implemented with the europressure, or not?

Look at Hungary, Poland. Euro pressure works only if you are not in EU. Then you can just Veto all and any resolutions you don\`t like.

[Clinton] relayed how Boris Yeltsin's late-night drinking during a visit to Washington in 1995 nearly created an international incident. The Russian president was staying at Blair House, the government guest quarters. Late at night, Clinton told Branch, Secret Service agents found Yeltsin clad only in his underwear, standing alone on Pennsylvania Avenue and trying to hail a cab. He wanted a pizza, he told them, his words slurring.

When Branch asked Clinton how the situation ended, the president shrugged and said, ‚ÄúWell, he got his pizza.‚Äù But the next night, Clinton recalled, Yeltsin tried to do it again.

The next night, Yeltsin eluded security forces again when he climbed down back stairs to the Blair House basement. A building guard took Yeltsin for a drunken intruder until Russian and U.S. agents arrived on the scene and rescued him.

The Washington Post has reported that during the 1995 press conference where Yeltsin called the U.S. press ‚Äúa disaster,‚Äù he was drunk on white wine. In another Post article, the former deputy secretary of state under Clinton suggested that the reason the U.S. president  had laughed so hard at Yeltsin‚Äôs ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù jibe was because he was trying to cover for how drunk the Russian president was. Another time, Yeltsin reportedly called Clinton while inebriated and asked him to hold a secret meeting on a submarine.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ohcqux/on_this_day_in_1991_boris_yeltsin_takes_office_as/h4ochn4/,usmilitarythrowaway1,1625897544

1530,"&gt;I am not very familiar with their politics, except that GERB and BSP are extremely corrupt, both are generally conservative, and DPS is GERB's partner in crime.

GERB and DPS are not just corrupt, they are working towards a complete takeover of the country and in many ways they had succeeded - insane syphoning of funds, control of judiciary and media, threats against business and even jailing business owners that do not bow, police control, feudal control of rural areas and on and on... Lets just say that if we weren't in the EU we would be looking a lot like Belarus right now. (despite all of this Manfred Weber, Kurz, Plenkoviƒá and Jansa today send Borissov personal video clips urging Bulgarians to vote for him again... the EPP is corrupt to the core, they are Borissov's last lifeline and they keep supporting him - you can see them on Borissov's facebook page, I can't link it as my comment gets automatically deleted)

DPS is a literal feudal structure with a feudal lord in ""Ahmed Dogan"" exploiting the rural Turkish minority in Bulgaria and using them as leverage by lowkey threatening ethnic tensions, war etc... while residing in [Sarays](https://www.capital.bg/shimg/zx952y526_4072293.jpg) (Turkish for palace)

Overall they alongside BSP simply inherited and continued the communist totalitarian structures. They simply split up the country in a feudal manner and pretended to be in opposition while continuing to rob us blind.

&gt;ITN is like a Bulgarian Zelenski I think?

Well intentioned (for now), but retard and mostly populist with a leader that was a top talk show host for 25 years - [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thduWjEjI6A) . They win votes by staging concerts, not so much offering policy. Only hope is that they bring in some good experts to run the show.

&gt;Is there any Bulgarian party that is progressive ? What's the deal with DB and ISMV?

DB is socially progressive and fiscally conservative + greens, it really is the only good choice, filled with many long time and well respected corruption fighters, journalists etc. Not perfect, but they deserve a chance.

ISMV another new party that arose from the 100 day protests, mixed bag of all kinds of people and structures and unfortunately quite a few political chameleons that can't be trusted. Still overall better than GERB, DPS and BSP.",Europa,/r/europe/comments/oh2mk5/bulgaria_market_links_poll_fieldwork_18_25_june/h4nqypf/,dothrakipls,1625883064

&gt;	Unfortunately if you do not play this game you are bound to lose it - it would be best to leave history to the researchers, but not while everyone else plays ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù - because then you‚Äôre placing yourself on the losing side. In today‚Äôs times it is very dangerous as we are in a state of ‚Äúmoral panic‚Äù that can justify atrocities / war if a given country is percieved as bad / naughty - the risk is too great.

I think this is the crux of the issue. Agree that Israel and Russia are playing very dirty politics with history. I know of only one German researcher who was banned(? Don‚Äôt recall exactly) in Poland for simply talking about things that happened. 

Politicization can go in at least two main directions: Propagandization of heroics and suffering, or to come out and deal with the more muddy/difficult things that were kept under wraps post war. 

Most western nations are slowly but surely dealing with the hard things, with Germany as the objectively most thorough in self-examination. I think this is why Poland‚Äôs (slow/backsliding) process is a bad look.  

To give a very recent example from Norway. It recently came to pass that our biggest heroes (Home Front/Resistance‚ÄùHjemmefronten‚Äù) probably knew about the deportation plan for our Jews in advance, but didn‚Äôt warn anyone or did anything about it. Maybe they didn‚Äôt mind?

It caused quite a stir, and the matter is not settled yet. In many people it dirties the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù picture we have painted for ourselves about our war. 

It‚Äôs hard and some families will feel their names tainted, but now that the actual heroes are mostly dead it get easier. 

I understand the scale, cost and generational pain is not comparable to Poland.

PiS is capitalizing on all this with the surrounded by enemies deal. If Poland would honestly deal with its history it would win far greater sympathy abroad than the current strategy which is meant for internal support. 

In the end it‚Äôs the attitude towards honest history and willingness to deal that brings nations forward.

Their issue is hesitation before the keeper. They play like perfect team players, where sometime there is only one striker in front of the goal. So he passes or looks for a team mate.

1684,"&gt;The Polish reform was challenged on two grounds by the Commission. First on the ground that the new law prescribed mandatory retirement ages for female judges, by the age of 60, and male judges, by the age of 65, whereas those ages were previously set at 67 years for both sexes. According to the Commission, *this infringed the principle of non-discrimination based on sex* in primary EU law of Article 157 TFEU, and also secondary EU law as by the ‚Äòequal pay for equal work‚Äô Directive  2006/54. \[1\]

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The European Commission maintains its position that the Polish Law is incompatible with EU law because by introducing a different retirement age for female judges (60 years) and male judges (65 years), it discriminates against individuals on the basis of gender. This is contrary to Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Directive 2006/54 on gender equality in employment. \[2\]

If the French were Polish, the EU would blame it for going against fundamental European values, call for starvation of EU funds, kicking it out, etc. The Polish matter is more complicated of course. This just shows how logical and equal the union and its institutions are.

I'm worried where this will lead. Sheer injustice in your face won't be tolerated forever. And it just keeps building up.

&gt;Feminist group protested in the premises of ""Oe24""
&gt;
&gt;Several activists were temporarily detained by the police because of the protest against ""racist femicide reporting"" by the Fellner medium
&gt;
&gt;Vienna - A feminist group broke into the premises of ""Oe24"" on Wednesday afternoon to protest against what they said was ""racist femicide reporting"" by the Fellner medium. The Vienna Task Force Feminist Alarm Department (WEFA) also posted its action on Twitter. Several activists were therefore temporarily detained by the police during the secession, but then released again.
&gt;
&gt;A banner read: ""Here you have your war of the roses! Man (s) do not kill for love"". The group also announced on Twitter its support for former employees who accuse editor Wolfgang Fellner of sexual harassment. Fellner denies these allegations as false and ""fictitious"", several proceedings are pending on the subject.
&gt;
&gt;In an initial statement on the action, ""Oe24"" managing director Niki Fellner stated that ""Oe24"" condemned ""this violent entry by masked extremists"" in the strongest possible terms. ""We will not let anyone - and certainly not from such actions - hinder our critical reporting,"" said Niki Fellner. ""Oe24"" played a leading role in ""uncovering the judicial failure of the recent murder of women by four Afghans"" and will ""not allow itself to be silenced by any action."" They condemn ""in particular the attacks on our female sales employees who were terrified by the activists"" and demand the strictest consequences from the executive.

If you think Germany and France would willing to pressure a key country for Croatia you are beyond delusional if that were the case Hungary and Poland would be playing along with EU and both have much more in stake for France and Germany

And Bulgaria and Romania would already be in Schengen and Eurozone but a simple No from Netherlands is more than enough to block them out. And as much as Germany and France want them in, Netherlands is a firm no. And relation there is different they could much easily pressure them. 

In the end a Slovenian PM would have to say Yes and no Slovenian PM will say yes. It also an issue that can be forced to a referendum which would never pass.

EU concluded, arbitration integrity was not compromised and is still valid. ECJ confirmed it as binding pending implementation and so council cannot even vote on the Croatia joining until the arbitration issue is resolved.

You literally have an impossible path to joining without signing. Council cannot vote on Croatia joining until arbitration agreement is signed and all border disputes with Schengen members solved. 

This is EU law, so vote on Croatia joining cannot even be called or happen until ECJ concludes the matter. There is also EU article that states that border disputes need to be Solved first.

After that there is still the vote in Council. 0% chance of Croatia joining especially with our current PM who is strongly taking us towards an alliance with V4.

It is simply a fact that many of todays slavic nations had a German speaking population. Maybe you mean the ""ethnic maps"" floating around?

2172,"&gt; The plan is just what you described, it just isn't working because of European bureaucracy, corruption, general incompetence and other, more complicated and subtle, obstacles

The plan is probably some loan to do that and use Chinese companies to do it for them, well in this case they can just skip this part and use China directly without needing EU financing. But would EU companies move there instead of just shoving money at them? Doubt it, they dont want to take the risks. The reason why China became succesful is because they were not afraid to take risks, go into any crack of the market, and sell with tiny profit margins until they overtake the market, and government subsidies also helped, which the EU can't do out of principle. China's power didn't fall out of the sky, they worked hard for it and took extreme gambles, others are not willing to take those risks.

&gt; contract the communist party signed with its people 

They didn't sign anything. They promised a new way to handle things and prosperity, and they delivered this. So you can't throw the same old tropes at them that ""communism creates famines"" and stuff like that. Your average Chinese schoolkid is probably better fed than your US one, despite the population challenges. Just face it on the social welfare front, they massively outdone even most of the ""Nordic model countries"" as well. So now on one side  you have people denying this and saying that China is more market oriented, while others just say that China could have done more without the CPC, but the truth is that neither is true. Precisely a half-market half-state hybrid economy is what made them succesful, and the 1 party system prevents political rivarly so decisions can be done quicker, like how they are able to build a hospital in 7 days while we can't build a hospital in 30 years. I don't say we need authoritarian 1 party system in europe, no god forbid, but you also have to recognize that maybe they do have some inherent advantages from this.

&gt; Automation breaks that because the more automation, the less people employed, the less money those people make

Yeyeye that is true everywhere, except that they, in their current position are the only ones willing to challenge this problem, which I don't thnk not even South Korea or Japan can. Which is that they have infused mass automation with mass welfare programs as well. One doesn't come at the expense of the other, society and technology growth simultaneously, this is what they mean by ""harmonious society"". If they were to automate stuff tomorrow, they will also ensure that people are retrained and have the necessary opportunities to adapt to the new economy. What they probably won't do is UBI, because that is a misdirection, shoving free money into the pockets of people is probably not good and it's a desperate western social-democrat attempt to save social welfare, but a strong leadership like that of China would probably fix the economy and create the opoortunities for people to retrain themselves instead of just shoving free money into your mailbox. This is why the west is not able to challenge China, they do everything the wrong way, it goes from the extremes of brutal neoliberalism into virtue signalling SJW with free helicopter money, but neither of them works. When Trump gave free money to tons of Americans, it was literally the most hilarous thing to watch, because the US is extremely against social welfare (which I critique too but not the actual safety net programs), but seeing Trump be the first guy to give free money even though he was the most outspoken anti-socialist out there is ridiculous. It also didn't helped anything and it was just a form of virtue signalling, so no matter how many UBI parties you vote into power here, they will also fail and make a joke of themselves. The only solution is to reorganize the economy and fix the demand supply gaps.

&gt; a huge swath of the population still lives in mass poverty in the rural areas and it's unlikley they will ever escape it

This is a false statement, in the past 10 years they have done extensive welfare programs especially aimed at rural development programs that help rural people.

&gt; They are trying to stop India by constantly challenging their border and becoming a patron of Pakistan - which obviously makes India hate China all the more.

They were hostile from the getgo, this is not going to change anytime soon, but will probably lead to stalemate, China can't invade India and India can't invade China so it's a stalemate between 2 large powers with massive populations. However India has it worse due to shrinking water supply from the Himalayas that China control. China did build massive pipe systems to bring water to critical areas, knowing about climate change issues in the future. India didn't, so either India does this quick, or they will have massive problems, drought and worse in the future.

&gt; The real plan was the belt and road initiative, 

I don't think that was their plan with BRI, and I am pretty sure they expected east europe to not join because we do whatever the EU tells us and many people like Macron and the Italians weren't very delighted, although the Germans would probably not care that much. The BRI was just a proposal, they put forward and some of it will stick some won't, it was a gamble. But I think they focuse more on the 3rd world anyway, they don't care about Europe or the US that much, they care about Africa and their vicinity in Asia more.

&gt;  which has made countries like Kenya, Sri Lanka, Indonesia or Ethiopia hate China and try anything possible to cut their ties with them

Not sure about this, but it's clear that China doesn't have good diplomatic skills. It's not like Russia which had a big baggage on itself, China could have used this and posed themselves as the diplomatic messiahs,but they failed there miserably, their diplomacy is just simply not good. Russians are better tacticians at this (probably their Cold war experience helped) but Russia is at a serious disadvantage due to the general warmongering attitudes, whereas China could have capitalized on this, they are not warmongers so they could have focused solely on good diplomacy, but they haven't, they messed up this part. They are good in economics but their diplomacy is bad.

&gt; They do have the power. Japan's navy is way more powerfull than Chinas

Might not be but half the US fleet being nearby is definitely overpowering, which is why they are working on their navy from what I read. I mean they could deter any invasion or land battle in their sea area with their missile defense, but they can't really project force beyond their territorial waters, no mobile ship fleet for that.

&gt; stop oil shipments from Saudi Arabia 

Which is why they are shifting more toward Iran from what I heard, they are moving fossil fuel through land from Iran, and that is why the US is in the area to sabotage that.

&gt;  it cannot sustain its energy output on its own

But they are building tons of hydro power plants, and even focus on fusion research, if they realize that, they will be extremely powerful.

&gt; - the fact that one is shia and the other sunni deppens that rivalry

But religion is going out of trend slowly but steadily around the world, surely they won't risk a major war in the modern era just because of religion. A competent leader and negotiation with enough power might be able to make peace there and resolve the conflicts, it's just question who gets there first Russia or China (some some other terciary power, the EU or India or whatnot) because it's clear that the US wasn't either willing nor capable of resolving this conflict.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/ogcjtg/average_age_in_us_and_eu/h4lbily/,linux_user__,1625839305

2230,"&gt; What the actual fuck are you on about? What jacobins and what jacobin agendas and jacobins actually with power or let alone in any significant numbers? 

Jacobins were the radical liberal faction in the French Revolution who sought to abolish absolutely everything tied to the old regime. Of course politically a lot of reforms were needed, but they went way beyond that, liberalizing society itself, introducing mass sexual revolution, prostitutes, and whatnot. This is exactly what happened in Weimar, and what is happening today as well. You can do reforms, certainly a lot of old stuff is bad, but when you start to chop off the pillars of society and without replacing it with sometihng equally sturdy, it will collapse. 

Take religion, I am an atheist so I won't cry for them,but I do recognize that religion did have some role in society and this fanatic abolishment of it, the so called ""new atheist"" movement is causing only more harm than good. In some cultures this is the only thing that keeps people together. And what are these new atheists talk about? Sex. That is literally all they talk about, every single fucking atheist youtuber is talking 99% about sex and 1% about the problems of religion. So we can see where this is going. We could make a stable atheist society too, but we choose not to, and we instead create mass sexualization, especially of children as well, and then wonder why fundamentalist Christians are getting angry? Like check yourself dude.

&gt; they just hate leftism and any other immigrants and/or other cultures/religions. 

I never blamed immigrants/emigrants, but I blame the elites who are using them as pawns in their game. Mass immigration is a phenomena is bad, but it's not the immigrants fault, they are just seeking a better life, but they are also used as pawns on a chessboard.

&gt; which is borderline racist 

I haven't even mentioned any race or ethnicity, so as far as you are concerned barbarity is a choice, it's a lifestyle, you either accept it or reject it.

2253,"&gt;The vaccines work but your claims are false, which the links you provided showed.

Not really?  It might not amount to 99% in those links, but close to it.

&gt;The issue is that there are reports from Israel that says the protection is only 70%

Yes, for the infection chance on the delta variant. But once you get infected the vaccine still helps to prevent you from getting seriously ill.

&gt;If the effect was 99% they wouldn't produce a booster dose.

Stop mixing infection chance and hospitalization rate.

that 99% is not infection chance, its the chance to develop serious symptoms after infection. So vaccinated people can still get and spread the infection, especially the Delta variant. So a booster in this case it to increase herd immunity even more and protect the un-vaccinated.

And like I said, its not 99% against the delta variant.

&gt;People exclaim with so much self confidence that the vaccine protects you from it 100%

No they dont. The media is full of 60-70% (Janssen) to 90-96% (Pfizer/Moderna).

&gt;It's all bro science

I wont know what this means.

?

Yeah and everybody knows this, especially governments. The difference is that this time the hospitals are expected to remain relatively empty even without lockdown measures.

2545," as an English fan, both sides played pretty well and people need to remember it would have probably not gone to penalty shootouts without the ET penalty, so people saying England only won due to a wrong ref decision are assuming there was no way they would've scored, as in the last 40 or so minutes Denmark began to fall apart - although they played great in the first half.

Even then, a Harry Kane penalty was denied earlier in the game that was more clear, although it wasn't given in the end. Plus, it's football, most footballers would've dived in that situation, and it's not our fault it's a penalty.

Penalties aside, the better team with the more attempts seemed to be England anyway, especially in Extra Time. Regardless, the 1-5% of super shitty England fans do not speak for the rest of us and in a strange way I almost hope we DO lose just so those types of people are shut up. They make me embarassed of being English sometimes...

I think part of the problem is that all of Europe is so anti-england that it makes the 1% worse, and our fans more obnoxious. Give us a break, we haven't won in 55 years! Denmark was a tough side, massive respect, and I only hope our fans arent this shitty in the final.

It is simply the spilling over of the same culture of violence that inhabits our nightclubs, our bars, our pubs, our street partys, our raves. Jesus christ, has anyone been to Creamfields!? My god, it's like going back to Roman times for the levels of depravity and scumbaggery going on.  


Trust me European friends, the English know that these fucking people exist, we tolerate them all, because we don't want to be the next ones glassed.  


And you know what? You can blame our Police force who now simply patrol social media and not the streets. 95% of crimes in our country go unsolves, and ALL types of violent and anti-social crime is up, because guess what, our Police just arrest people for saying stupid things on social media, instead of actually arresting violent twats who can be found outside every pub. And people don't press charges anymore, because there are no more free lawyers.  


Our country is a fucking mess, this has been going on for decades, and everyone blithely accept it for what it is. I've been to enough pubs/clubs/schools to learn that the thing you're witnessing in the football stands is a problem this country has had for probably hundreds of years.

When a family only has one child, and grandparents only have one grandchild- that child tends to be showered with attention and gifts, making them relatively spoiled and soft. 

None of its recruits (or at least very few of them) had the kinds of experiences that make good soldiers. None of them ever had to stick up for their younger brothers and fight someone they didn‚Äôt even know, none of them had an older brother they looked up to, none of them had to share things with their brothers, none of them had to learn to forgive their brothers after quarreling, they didn‚Äôt have to share a room with their brothers. 

The result is soldiers who have problems with some of the basics of soldiering. Some of that can be addressed with training, but training as adult isn‚Äôt a complete substitute for qualities that were not formed as a child.

2718,"Africa is actually growing faster than you would think - in general developing nations are advancing much faster nowadays than in the past in part due to technology. In any case, my point was that Europe is not helping Africa - or a part of Africa, since Europe does not have the resources to help 50 countries - to develope faster. It could do it by focusing on a number of countries (Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia) that are developing at an impressive pace. And in truth, Europe is trying to do just that, but it is failing miserably - Macron especially wants a Marshall plan for Africa, but Merkel turned him down (at least according to a book about him) and his individual attempts so far have not been particularly successful.

As for East Asia, yeah, I know about automation and all that - Japan is already doing it, as well as moving some of their operations to young countries that buy their stuff (which is what Europe could be doing with African countries if Europe was not so incompetent at it). But in China's case, the fact that they relaxed the one child policy is pointless because it takes 20-25 years until those children can actually, you know, contribute to the work force, automation is in danger of destabilizing its manufacturing and export based economy and then there is it's biggest issue: all of its neighbors hate it. India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong all would love to see China fall, and they are doing everything in their power to destroy it.

As for the Middle East, yeah, The West did a lot of bad, but it's not like it was a peacefull or stable place before that. Saudi Arabia and Iran will not stop fighting if America and Europe all of a sudden leave. Saudi Arabia will still fund various terrorist groups and islamic extremists because they know that they cannot beat Iran in a fair fight, so their strategy is to burn every country around it in the hopes that they take Iran with them.",,/r/europe/comments/ogcjtg/average_age_in_us_and_eu/h4jmaei/,MikkaEn,1625795875

Being made to feel ‚Äúunwelcome‚Äù is an ‚Äúextremely subjective‚Äù metric to measure in the first place. Polls consistently put the UK at the top end of tolerance in Europe. 

&gt; it also shows the UK to be roughly in the middle

Roughly in the middle for that one specific question. When you take the whole poll into account the UK is at the top. Seems unlikely that a country as unwelcoming as the UK rank in such a position. 

&gt; Hundreds of thousands of workers are refusing to go to the UK all of the sudden

Because the UK has left the EU and it makes it more difficult to emigrate? That was the one of the reasons for Brexit. It wanted complete control over immigration which it couldn‚Äôt do as part of the EU. It doesn‚Äôt make the UK intolerant or unwelcoming. 

&gt; practically begged to

Who‚Äôs begging? The British government isn‚Äôt. The majority of the British people aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs private companies who have gotten used to paying their workers less because of the annual influx of cheap labour from Eastern Europe. 

&gt; It‚Äôs common for us to hear

Its common to hear anything that the media wants to draw on. The UK is a country of 65 million people. There is bound to be racist incidents but, again, polls which consistently show the UK as a tolerant place shows that these are the exception not the rule. 

&gt; most people cite a significant change in attitude.

China has engaged in human rights abuses of ethnic minorities for decades, see Tibet, Mongolia. The story of Hong Kong is more complicated with it's history of colonisation by the English, and subsequent importance in global trade and finance.

China's centralised authoritarian model, it's role in international relations becomes more fraught. With China's international role evolving and their salience seemingly at a historical high, Europe - to your point - is mounting a political campaign for a multitude of reasons. Not least of all; the abuses and mistreatment of the Chinese Uyghur population.

2894,"&gt; I'm not sure putting it all on immigration is correct.

High rates of immigration of low-skilled workers directly adds poverty and exacerbates existing poverty among the population. This is undeniable but because of ideology and because massive immigration benefits certain people (especially the Democrat party), any real analysis can't be publicly discussed without accusations of racism and also bristly defense and anger from the groups in question who favor their immigrant groups over the wellbeing of the US.

By design, the vast majority of immigrants in the US are poor, uneducated, often illiterate people from the third world. The US does not apply any standards for immigrants, like every other developed country does, that requires them to demonstrate that they won't be dependent on the system, at least for the vast majority of immigrants. Only a small percentage of immigrants in the US go through the H-1B visa process. No matter how egalitarian or how much opportunity a country has, this results in large numbers of people having an economic disadvantage compared to the local population. The US has been importing the crime and poverty from Latin American for decades and paying the bill for it. So these immigrants will often be in poverty, and will depend on social services. Now, in the US we have finite amount of social services, so Americans who are already predisposed to living in poverty have to compete with foreigners. Also unskilled labor growing in size due to immigration depresses wages. Everyone knows this and if they deny it they are a liar. So that means it makes it harder for actual Americans to pull themselves out of poverty, which means less social mobility and more inequality.

Immigration absolutely does all of these things. And this directly results in poor health outcomes. Health is often a function of socioeconomic status. Poor people are more likely to have poor health outcomes and also to engage in crime that results in violent deaths.

&gt; However, not to point any fingers, but I don't know it's new immigrants driving that, either.

Black and latino people commit the vast majority of violence in the US. The Latino population in the US consists primarily of people whose origins in the US are via illegal immigration. The black population is mostly multi-generational but their prospects are severely impacted by high rates of immigration from Latinos, because they're competing for social services and for jobs. And the wages of the working class altogether are lower due to mass migration from Latin America. And taxes are higher for people who earn wages, because of the gigantic social burden of tens of millions of poor Latinos.",,/r/europe/comments/ogcjtg/average_age_in_us_and_eu/h4jao5a/,Soul_Like_A_Modem,1625789664

Yep, I wasn't sure what the terminology is. Basically my country has medieval level rural areas where many people still heat with logs, in Hungary they upgraded from this gap into centrally distibuted gas via pipes, so that heat comes via pipes so that you can boil water, a boiler in the basement and you have warm water for bathroom and water in the radiator. 

We could skip this, and go directly into electric, since every house is electrified, we are not that behind, but we don't need to go into gas today, yet a lot of fossil fuel lobbyists would definitely want us to go down that path. 

WIth having everything through universal power cables, we can have both heat, electricity and  other forms of power supplied this way. Joule-wise it's probably more efficient to carry electricity in high voltage wires than to pump water or gas through pipes. And safetywise it's definitely better. So the costs should definitely reflect that.

Central power supplying power plants, and there we can debate what kind of power plants to have, but in any case power has to be centrally supplied otherwise it won't work. I am even skeptical about self-generation (with solar) becasue that might be inefficient too, although might be it's own niche.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/ogbotx/temperature_map_of_europe_today_08072021/h4iv8rv/,linux_user__,1625781847

The seventeen point agreement was signed in 1951, the invasion was in 1950. Your assertion was that China invaded Tibet 50 or less years ago. This is inaccurate.

The hooligan fans are not becoming proto-fascists as they have no political ambitions - yes many will hold nationalistic right wing views, but their support for England is not informed by this. Nor is their vile behaviour towards opposition fans, they are not doing this because they believe in an inherent superiority of the English over other nations, but rather because they are terrible twats who like to do this for the sake of it.

These fans are not organised at all. What group are they represented by? In Italy for example there are official ultras groups, for example the Inter ultras who defended racist Cagliari fans after their own player was racially abused. The only thing some of these fans have in common is that they support England and are cunts. That‚Äôs it.

I‚Äôve never seen any thread brigaded with comments like those by English fans either. I‚Äôm not denying that individual comments like this exist but they are a tiny minority. Even people who say or believe this in real life are not organised into a group with these beliefs. They just happen to support the England national team.

Most people there are the children of the previous political class and they've known eachother from childhood and have a very internal elite club. A lot of politics is filled with those types but the EU seems overflowing with them.

Likewise mate. The folk on reddit usually come here looking for a bitter fight and it's really hard to tell how much of what they say is shared by the majority or not. I assure you that on the ground in England at least it's not so black and white as it is on reddit. Most people like Europeans, share the same values, and want to move on as allies and friends and family. There are many many brexiteers unhappy with the hostility we've shown in the last five years, and many remainers unhappy with the hostility we've received (myself included). Most people accept the result but would have preferred it to be a much classier affair.

But alas, populism is rising on the right all across Europe and the left continues to take harsher and harsher positions on nuanced issues, and its bred a particularly vicious climate which has trickled down into the minds of usually sensible and calm people.

Don't let the nutters sway your opinion of us brits too much. We love to laugh (a lot of the time at ourselves) and drink (sometimes a little too much, particularly when abroad sorry), and we generally believe in fairness and equality.

3521,"I think the idea is that many of these countries lived under either direct soviet control or soviet domination. This meant that much of the existing infrastructure built during this period was built with the idea that infrastructure show 'flow' from directly Russia to the 'subordinate' countries as opposed to integrating between 'subordinate' countries. Not completely sure for the former Yugoslavic countries, but maybe the infrastructure keeps flowing in the same lines, maybe solidarity, maybe the bigger it is, the more sway in the EU and thus better chance of EU funding. I'm no expert and am not going to act like one.

3537,"&gt;If sending armies to Mali is the only decision that's difficult to make... what if ""minorities"" in Estonia start a war like in Donbass and Germany doesn't want to upset Russia?

The EU army has a standing order to protect the territorial integrity of the EU and is mandated to intervene. There would have to be a motion to stop the intervention rather than start it.

What you describe is the current situation.

&gt; if this army is meant to replace the armies of the EU countries I foresee problems and the main issue to me is the lack of solidarity, you can't have a common army if you don't give a shit about other countries that would potentially be defended by that army,
I kind of doubt it if anything it would just bring problems up to the surface (that won't happen during the peace period because when is peace everything is great. but what if Greece and Turkey come to blows and France is like ""sorry, you shouldn't have provoked Turkey"")

It'll be a professional army with a command structure that is independent of the national governments so they can't derail it, and no endless political bickering is necessary to have it defend the territory - that's the point. It's the current situation that allows politically delaying mutual support actions.

This also makes it necessary that the army will take any threats to its territory seriously - a very important function of an army is a deterrent, an army that doesn't react is a laughing stock.

3544,"&gt; 1,30 ain't that much

Probably means tens of millions of deaths in Bangladesh and hundred of millions of refugees.

*Average* worldwide raise of sea level is one thing. Remember that it is also coupled with an increase of the frequency of out-of-scale meteorological events such as surge storms, tidal waves etc. all that in an industrial context where fossil fuels *have already* been phased out, if only because of the inevitable depletion of deposits.

Seeing the number and length of Dutch levees, and how they were constructed over *centuries*, raising them all to match 1.3 m raise *and* abnormal events becoming the norm, this is indeed a lot.

Now, think also of the disruption to port operations. Adding 1.3 m to the sea level in the port of Rotterdam won't be quite easy (and again guading against frequent freak events), *knowing that the other end of the shipping lines* originate in coutries that don't have the same skillset and funds to adapt to such changes, and you can see major disruption in shipping trade, which has always been a vital trade for the Netherland.


1.3 m seems pedestrian indeed. A raise of 1.3 m of the average level of *all the seas and oceans around the globe* is globally enormous and there is little doubts that the consequences will be severe for the Low Countries.

&gt; Gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States represents the total aggregate output of the U.S. economy. It is important to keep in mind that the GDP figures, as reported to investors, **are already adjusted for inflation**. In other words, if the gross GDP was calculated to be 6% higher than the previous year, but inflation measured 2% over the same period, GDP growth would be reported as 4%‚Äîor the net growth over the period. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/gdpinflation.asp)

.
&gt; Reported gross domestic product is adjusted for inflation [souce](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/112814/why-does-inflation-increase-gdp-growth.asp)

https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/comparing-real-and-nominal-gdp/

take a look at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Romania). There is a table there with data between 1980 and now. Look at the 90s, the GDP Growth and inflation column. Do you think that with those inflation levels GDP shrank in nominal value as well?

Example: let's take [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xzlx0/second_estimation_of_eu_gdp_growth_in_2016_by/) table about year 2016, posted in March 2017, second estimation means almost final results. I'm sure that if you folowed this subject you're familiar with this table, posted every 3 months here, as soon as EC updates it with latest data. Look at Romania, Q4 compared to Q4 from prev year. 4.8%. Same as in the wiki table with historical data for Romania. (And yes, we had deflation that year. It was sort of an administrative deflation, VAT was reduced from 24% to 19% iirc)

&gt; Accordingly, price movements will not inflate the growth rate. [source](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/tec00115&amp;lang=en).

If you click to view table it won't work, at least it didn't for me. But notice the name of the table if you want to download it. *tec00115* You can see the content [here](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=tec00115) (notice the url), Romania is not visible (at least it wasn't for me).

During the USA World Cup Tassoti poked him in the nose making him bleed. At the end of the match (1/4 final, Italy won 2-1 scoring 3 minutes from the end), Tassoti went to apologize to him but he didn't accepted... for 17 years. He shaked hands with Tassoti in 2011, when he was Roma's coach and Tassoti was Milan's support coach.

So Luis Enrique has a long history with Italy not just because he coached there, but also from his player times.

4074,"&gt; When they start failing, you're the cash cow

That's how it works with many of our private enterprises, so it would make no difference.

&gt; You really think Corbyn supporters will say 'we pay him 3m a year but that the market rate for a CEO'?

If they can justify that kind of pricetag, yes. 

It's the right-wing who throw a tantrum when they heard about well paid workers at public enterprises.

&gt; Because this is a very simplistic view. There is a reason why private companies sell the phones - they do a better job at making them. 

Now that's a simplistic view, there's literally no reason why private companies have any kind of inherent advantage. It's pure dogma pushed be neoliberal ideologues.

&gt; It's a very competetive market and that is good for the consumer. You also have to think about spiraling costs in the public sector, and then would anyone want a 'state produced phone' for privacy reasons?

More competition (from an SOE) can only be a good thing, most of Norway's economy is state-owned and they do very nicely. 

One of the few SOEs we've had in recent years (Directly Operated Railways) put the private sector to shame in terms of efficiency, prices, and customer satisfaction, all while turning record profits which they paid to the treasury in it's entirety. Our government shut them down because they were making the private TOCs look like shit, their network was privatised, and then the private company who took over (Virgin rail) couldn't even turn a profit after increasing prices and cutting services, the private company collapsed and the government had to bail them out, costing us billions. 

There's no additional privacy from using a non state-manufactured phone lol, the government already records and stores everything. Having SOEs making handsets isn't gonna make any difference to that in the slightest.

&gt; Because if they fail, the government will have to bail them out. That may be acceptable in China, but Britain?

Like I keep telling you, we routinely bail out companies when they fail. It's pretty much the cornerstone of the Thatcherite privatisation package - the profits get privatised and the taxpayer picks up the bill when these companies are asset-stripped and ran into the ground.

&gt; I look at HS2 and I wonder what a state-run car brand or phone manufacturer would be like.

HS2 is being built by the private sector lol.

https://www.building.co.uk/focus/which-construction-firms-have-landed-hs2-contracts-so-far/5101271.article

&gt; Corruption is also lower in China as the state is very powerful.

Some of the UK's politicians would definitely end up in the dock if we took anti-corruption seriously, but our political system is basically built around it.

&gt; China is a special case and I'm not sure would work in Europe. 

Yeah, I don't think China's model could be fully replicated but there's definitely aspects we could draw from and adapt to the UK...We can call it ""Socialism with Chinese characteristics with Anglo characteristics"". 

&gt; It would have to be EU-wide for one thing to have a big enough economy

I'd be fully open to that tbh, I'm generally a bit of a Euroskeptic but that's mainly due them being a bit too pro-market and pro-privatisation for my liking. If the EU was setting up massive, continent-spanning superstate-owned enterprises I'd be a lot more in favour of them tbh.",,/r/europe/comments/ofjqnn/67_per_cent_of_young_brits_want_a_socialist/h4f0ke4/,RedTerror88,1625702752

North Macedonia tries to adopt the history of ancient Macedonia, while they are a slavic population that arrived in the area 1000 years later, combined with Albanian and Bulgarian minorities, in order to get some sense of national identity. I understand the name of yhe area is Macedonia, but the statues and the associations are just nonsense. 

On the other hand, Greece, when it became a state after being a part of the ottoman empire for 400 years(!), had populations of Greeks, Slavs, Albanians and Turkish in the area. The population was poor and uneducated. To get a sense of national identity, they ""inherited"" all of the accomplishments of the Greek speaking ancient populations, and made the Christian Orthodox religion the second part of the identity. Now, they are annoyed that another population is adopting history to get an identity, what Greece did 200 years ago. Modern Greece meanwhile is one of the most (if not the most) corrupted state in the EU, with one of yhe most backwards societies, the highest unemployment and the most corrupted media.

I am not too much into the details of German laws, but in Austria, the Austrian president could pick anyone a chancellor, who then can propose a government. It's only that the parliament could vote out the government in power. This is why it's *typical* that a coalition of two parties that have more than 50% of the seats also form the government (otherwise, the remaining parties could kick out your government). It's a convention, not a law, though. To my knowledge, many EU countries have similar mechanisms.

No it does not ,this chart proves that they are all in cahoots.  Whether it's Corbyn, Bernie Sanders, Syriza, they are all the same.

You can't base your country on empty populist rhetoric, and most of them are not even sincere about it, they just say the stuff you want to hear because that gets them the vote.What happens after the election is just endless excuses and blaming others for not being able to fulfill their jobs.

4406,"I think you'd do well reading up on it as I think Japan is much more comparable than South-Asian emerging markets. Maybe non-eurozone countries are more comparable. Within the Eurozone however we see grave imbalances due to European countries holding a tight lid on domestic consumption and wages. This way they, mostly Germany, are creating a huge trade surplus which needs to be absorbed. First by S-Europe, but now they are forced to cut back kn imports (their exports haven't gone up, it's been purely constraint of domestic demand while not gaining competitiveness.) so now by mostly the US. 

This makes us highly dependent on the US consumer market. More so than in the past. What do we do with this surplus? Invest in US assets.. We are subsidizing the dollar with our surplus while we could develop more industries and a larger consumer base at home.

Normally this would be done partially automatically. A rising Deutschmark and sticky wages would mean higher wages and cheaper imports comparatively. Instead, the Euro is diluted by the south which is facing massive output gaps and sky high unemployment. If the Euro would appreciate they'd only be pushed into even higher unemployment so there's a limit to how much it can rise before it gets dragged down by opposite forces.

The result? Lower wage growth but much higher company profits than would have been the case in n-Europe causing excess savings that can't be invested at home (as the consumer sector isn't growing). S-Europe's industrial base gets demolished in the meantime, causing massive unemployment and declining economic activity which makes the debt burden only bigger.

Germany should let wages rise, a lot, to decrease business sector saving and it should update its aging infrastructure (again decreasing the total savings of the economy because it'd need to borrow). At the same time investment in the South should focus on increasing exports to grow the economy, instead of employing ""expansionary austerity"" that's the equivalent of quitting your job so you don't have to pay for the bus ticket anymore.",North Brabant (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/ofjipn/interesting/h4d6rk2/,Brakb,1625673311

4513,"Fun fact, the original meaning of the word ""literally"", is the exact same definition that we use the word ""literary"" for these days. i.e. it's anything to do with the written word, books, letters, whatever. The way we use ""literary"" these days, we originally used ""literally"" to mean the same thing. 
  
All the people who whine about how the word ""literally"" has changed meaning (even though it started to be used as hyperbole, to mean ""figuratively"", centuries ago, it's not a recent trend that Tik Tok created, or some dumb shit like that), these people really get on my nerves. Because MOST words have changed meaning over time, very often they literally mean the opposite of what they originally did. Like the word ""awful"" use to mean something great, something that fills you with awe, hence awe-full
But nowadays it means the opposite, something that's terrible. 
       
No, they literally only care about this one word, ""literally"", and not about all the other thousands of words in English that changed meaning or had a new meaning added to the original. Cos they wanna appear smart and superior to all the kids who they claim are using the word ""literally"" incorrectly (but again, they're not, ""literally"" has been used as hyperbole or to mean figuratively for centuries, Mark Twain, Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald are some examples of authors who used ""literally"" that way) 
    
Cos ""literally"" to mean ""something that really actually happened, in a literal manner or sense; exactly"", *that isn't even the original meaning of the word 'literally'*. 
 
People whine about it cos they wanna appear smart and hate the ""new generation"". But if they were truly smart they'd go look up what the original definition of the word is, and whine about that instead. But they wanna whine about how they want ""literally"" to have the 2nd historical definition, cos they don't like the 3rd definition, but don't worry, some arse hole pedant like me will come in and also try to sound smart by pointing out they there was a different original 1st definition of ""literally"". 
   
Is it working? I've managed to make myself sound like an even bigger twat than the people who won't shut up about how they hate how people use the word ""literally"". But I'm OK with being a twat.

Obviously they don't. Most didn't have either the chance or the interest to ask.

Honestly, I get the feeling a lot of these people think the whole homosexuality thing is just the latest iteration of the ""younger people going off into the weeds"" trend they've been dealing with their whole adult lives. In their time they've seen the  good old 50s era be replaced by the hippie movement, drug epidemics, rock and roll music, tattoos and piercings, skimpy bikinis, the internet and people glued to their phones- all of which have some amount of personal choice for the people who decide to engage with them. If you fought this stuff every step of the way like a nice straight laced boy from the 1940s who thinks everyone should stay as it was back in your formative years, this ""homosexuality is natural and there's nothing wrong with it"" must sound alot like the latest iteration of an old hat they've been dealing with for ages.

P.S. The company that maintains the building won't pay for a 5W LED to light an alleyway which is the only entrance, and is in complete darkness as soon as sunset arrives.  I have to tell visitors to bring a light with them.  It's been that way with a dozen residents complaining every year for 20+ years.

\- Somewhere I can leave my car overnight and walk home (nearest charging points are literally ONE single vehicle point, approximately a mile from home... shared with 10,000 other people) and walk back to it in the morning without significantly adding to my commute and where I can keep an eye on my vehicle (there's a reason I have a flat with an allocated parking space around here).  Let's hope I never have to drive someone to hospital in an emergency, eh?

\- In my workplace (currently one charging point for the workplace's electric vehicle which is parked in it 99% of the time).  It cost approximately ¬£10,000 to install, lots of digging and re-tarmaccing, because the buildings just aren't designed with running power out to the car parks in mind.

The line would need to hire a PMC for round-the-clock combat operations, and they'd need to hire a good PMC that doesn't fuck about with the rules of engagement and start shooting at any ""military aged male"" just because they're bored. They could hire locals but the Pakistani gov't isn't keen on its citizens having military training and materiel in rural areas for obvious reasons and besides any local who is given a rifle and told to guard a train will probably run the complete opposite direction as soon as bullets start flying. So they'd need to hire professionals, and even bad PMCs are expensive--US$750k-$2mi per contractor per year was the going rate in Afghan for employing a PMC and they mostly just operated motorcades for VIPs.

It's mind-boggling stupidity and it's stupefying to see it resurface in 2021. Mass-surveillance is actively, provably harmful to *all* people, and only adds very little help to the police, while increasing their workload 1000x and making them follow a ton of mis-leads.

Also it's impossible to make a backdoor that only the ""right"" people have the keys to, and people so technical incompetent as to propose a backdoor in the first place are the last ones that should be trusted with such keys anyway. Inevitably they'll end up in the wrong hands, those incompetents will end up with a lot of egg on their face, and again it's the citizens who suffer.

Last but not least this surveillance can be circumvented with minimal efforts, by using GPG/PGP encryption for email and OTA encryption for messaging. I guess the next step is to ban all encryption and to investigate anybody using GPG/OTA encryption because surely they must be up to no good.

The map in question (at the top of the comment thread) is probably the [ILGA-E map](https://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/MAP_0.png) about the *legal* situation of gay people in the broader European region. It doesn't take into account any social factors (so knowing gay Georgians doesn't mean anything), it just looks at laws and state policies. 

Nevertheless, the map shows that Georgia has the most favourable legal framework in its region, far better than its neighbours Russia, Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan.

4993,"No -- as I said, it doesn't give you any special outs, and everyone's constitution is gonna work this way.  Russia can say ""my constitution tells me to do this"", but nobody else is gonna care -- they're still gonna treat Russia as violating international law.

The US is perfectly capable of amending its constitution to say ""the federal government must seize any and all merchant ships it can find"".  That is *not* going to cause other countries to say ""that isn't piracy"" -- it's still going to be treated as a breach of international law.  But the US is still going to follow its constitution.

I haven't dug into the specifics of Russia's thing, but I'm a little suspicious that it relates to the fact that Russia was having a spat with the Council of Europe over the Ukrainian invasion, [starting with the suspension of Russia's voting rights](https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/council-of-europe-assembly-suspends-russia-s-voting-rights/).  My guess is that Russia was just making it explicit to Russian courts that the CoE cannot overrule Russia's constitution...which isn't a huge surprise.

This doesn't mean that the CoE need have the same view; it can and will take the position that Russia is obliged to follow CoE mandates regardless of its constitution.

We've been over this before a number of times WRT precedence of EU law and national constitutions.  There have been several disputes -- most recently that of Germany with the ECB budget.  If Germany says ""my constitution tells me to do X"" and the ECJ says ""you must not do X"", Germany will do X and then be ruled as to be in violation of EU law.  But Germany is still gonna follow Germany's constitution.

That's because there isn't one coherent system of law here.  Treaties or customary international law can require that a country do something that conflicts with something that its national legal system, as defined by its constitution, requires.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/oeyxtx/estonian_consul_detained_in_st_petersburg_while/h4bts2g/,duisThias,1625639674

5404,"&gt;I don't think it can happen anymore, because UK cheats and doesn't keep agreements.

&gt;Like if we agreed with them to the above. The next day they would just break it, and then we're back in the problems.

&gt;They'd agreed to follow inner market rules, but then just, say, make hormone meat legal in the UK (or allow something else banned in the inner market) and then tell us it's ""flexibility."" They wouldn't follor the rules I think.

That's even more the case they not be allowed A or B.

The beauty of it is the UK is currently in a massive bind as a net food and energy importer, amongst other goods. Labour importer too, if the emptier shelves from lack of lorry drivers are any indicator.

So far the only agreement not kept (Brexit wise) is the unilateral extension of NIP grace periods and the opaque implementation of the NIP (EU is supposed to get transparent reports on the border at the sea.) That's what this escalation from the EU is about, actually.

Military and civilians are quite different things, if I were to base every nation's military and their doings as for how the said nation is, I probably wouldn't love any nation. War is war, let's not pretend that any side cared for each other, whether civilian or soldier, they cared for survival. I can assure you that no Bosnian cared for my family, the same way mine didn't care for theirs. And please, both Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina had a military and weren't as innocent as you paint them. Serbia wasn't innocent by any means either, but only pointing out one side's sins is quite hypocritical. 

For example, we have the Bosnian military killing 56 Bosnian Serbs in village of Josanica, near Foca, in December '92. Three kids (of which the youngest was only 2 years old) and 21 women were killed. Three of my family members died on that day, amongst them was my earlier mentioned grandfather, who was over 80 at the time. If they hadn't escaped earlier, my mother and aunt (who were 10-12 at the time) would've been dead as well. There's still no justice for them. 29 years later. 

The same way, I recognise Srebrenica and many more war crimes committed by Serbs. I don't sugarcoat them. I never did because if one truly recognises the war, they have to look at all sides. 

I'm all for the prosecution of all war criminals regardless of their nationality, as long as we don't act like there is just one side to blame and that civilians should suffer the same.
NATO bombing brought no one good, and as much as some like to insist, it didn't help Albanians much either, with NATO bombing places that were quite populated with them as well. Cancer rates in both nations skyrocketed since '99. I do agree with your later points about them, yes.

&gt;Because Westminster and the respective parties are all aware of the issue of devolution and Scottish nationalism, its just that their execution of trying to stem the support of Scottish nationalists have been incompetent.

Ah yes, like all that accidental internment. Purely a misunderstanding. An outlier if you will.

&gt;I've accepted Scottish notes as payment personally, they're legal tender, it's just ignorance on it being refused.

Funny how that ignorance never works the other way around. I was able to use English-issued notes in Wales and Scotland.

&gt;No it's not, your pattern is one of sectarianism, where as we're (As in Scots and English) Are not that bothered by the naming.

Myopic nonsense. What pattern of mine are you talking about? 

&gt;*I don't think the next power grab is that far off.*  
&gt;  
&gt;You notion is predicated on a perpetual Tory government, which is flawed.

It's for at least another three years. You won't even have to wait a year for the next move.

&gt;*It's comical rather than serious. Sorry about the breakdown of the UK though. It does actually negatively affect Ireland.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Rumours of the death of the UK are highly exaggerated

The impacts are already being felt here. Hopefully the breakdown is not permanent.

&gt;*As usual, the constitutional implications just whoosh by.*  
&gt;  
&gt;We don't have a written consitution though.

Yes, that was the joke.

&gt;Jacobite ideology originated with James VI and I, first monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1603...

I'm sure the idea of a Jacobite king originated with the Jacobite king, but he was living in France, working for the French and the invasions were managed by the French. Your article says ""The English Jacobites made it clear they would do nothing without foreign backing,""

In the end, Jacobitism ended when France pulled the plug, rather than with the end of the Stuart line, which came some time later.

&gt;*There's no violence or prospect of violence.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Uh huh

I don't think anybody is bothered by that, you'll see it peak over the next week or so and then all the high spirits will die down after the 12th. Maybe you aren't old enough to remember actual violence in Northern Ireland or England.

&gt;*Anyway, the EU care more about the single market, so it won't get watered down. There'll be some tokenism and then alignment.*  
&gt;  
&gt;No it'll be watered down and explained away as being ""effectively the same""

That would be an extraordinary and unique victory for Boris. I think we should see the outcome soon enough.

&gt;And mine will be right

More evidence-free optimism. Hopefully Boris will strike down the EU, Labour will win a landslide and the Scots will start voting Labour.

&gt;Despite the trade restrictions, so the restrictions have hampered trade, just like Brexit did with British exports this isn't rocket science.

Except of course that trade is up between Australia and China.

&gt;UK to EU exports rise to near pre-Brexit levels as trade deficit

5654,"&gt;  
If it's not complicated like you say, then why are you repeatedly misunderstanding the fundamental dynamics between Scots and English people? Yeah, the trend is diverging, but it's not as if this hasn't happened numerous times before...

The trend is diverging on constitutional issues. Also I think Scotland are tired of the conservative party running the UK and likewise the conservative party would like to guarantee their majority by leaving out Scotland. The union is not very flexible at all and with the failure of the Lib Dems attempt at voting reform, it looks incapable of change either.

&gt;But they're not voting for independence as a protest vote, they're voting for the SNP because they're another left wing party which is similar to Labour.  
[https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/opinions/votes-snp-are-not-votes-independence](https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/opinions/votes-snp-are-not-votes-independence)

At last, a link to some information. The Centre on Constitutional Change look like a genuine organisation, but that article is from 2015, before Brexit. Even so, it notes that ""support for independence has grown of course since (and reached 45 per cent in last year‚Äôs referendum)"". Since 2015, support for both independence and the SNP has continued to grow. 

  
Rather than diverging, I think support for independence just lags slightly behind the SNP vote. As you said, the trend is clear.

&gt;*At this stage some Tories would love to see Scotland independent, it would lock in their majority permanently.*  
That some being no where near influencial in the party.

  
Nobody has made any statements to that effect, but with the aggressive moves against devolution, you'd have to suspect the current cabinet. They don't seem to care much for NI either.

&gt;Again you fundamentally misinterpret the way in which the country votes, it's not an ""English vote"" It's a south east English vote against the rest, who of which, up until recently, worked together to counter that

453 of the 650 seats are English. There may be a difference of opinion between north and south but all the Scots see are a bloc that will continously hand the conservatives a majority.

&gt;*I think they pretty much are there forever.*  
There's that complacency you're talking about.

[Since 1945, the Conservatives have been the dominant political force in Britain.](https://www.dummies.com/education/politics-government/post-1945-british-governments/)  Also 'complacency' means 'self-satisfaction especially when accompanied by unawareness of actual dangers or deficiencies', i.e. thinking everyrthing is going to work out fine. Worrying about an endless Tory majority is by definition not complacent.

&gt;Nope. Core support for independence will always be there, but to pretend that the COVID Brexit and Austerity and the Tory government haven't helped the Scotnats is naive, to think that a future Lab government wouldn't put a dampener on support for independence is also naive, and to think I said that the SNP voters are confused Tories is laughable.

They're not my opinions, you asked me to describe yours. So you're pinning everything on a future Labour government then?

&gt;No, complacency is a view where you fatalistically presume the current government will remain in power forever and there's nothing nobody can do about it.

See. the dictionary definition of complacency above. What kind of timeframe are you thinking of; 2024, 2028? Further out?

&gt;*Labour in alliance with ... SNP? I don't know where you're going to get the numbers from for a Labour majority.*  
Will never happen, and its arrogant to presume that someone who votes Conservative is a perpetual Tory voter. I don't think you understand what swing voters are.

So you're hoping for a Labour landslide? And I'm naive to think otherwise?

&gt;*Typically countries have more control over their affairs than states.*  
Unless they're in a Union with another country and both are represented as one.

That's not a union of equals or even of proportionate representation. It's quite shocking.

&gt;You didn't ask that, you wanted me to point to you to where the UK broke international law, I provided it, but now it's small beer yeah, the Iraq-Iran conflict cost over a million lives, but to you, that's small beer, lol.

Don't flatter yourself,  the UK. had nothing to do with the Iran/Iraq war. The arms sales were small beer in that conflict. I didn't ask for a single example of breaking international law, I said that the UK were more law-abiding and less corrupt. You'd need more evidence than that to make them look as bad as the current cabinet.

&gt;Comparing Britain of the 1800's to the Britain of today is disingenious. Britain is in part responsible for codifying into international law rules of civilised behaviour whilst in combat.

Britain hasn't changed at all, it has the same institutions, laws, parties, nationalism, elite classes from Eton and warmongering press that it did in the 1800s.   
Britain had very little to do with codifying anything in the 20th century, that was the Americans. ""Civilised behaviour"", ""international law"" is all bullshit that British imperialists tell themselves to sleep better at night. Britain has an appalling human rights record, stretching back centuries and continuing right up to the present day.

&gt;*What about that European Commission of Human Right finding for use of torture and Britain's subsequent conviction. Another outlier?*  
Pretty much yeah.

Because that conflicts with your ""civilised behaviour"" fantasy?

&gt;*I think you may have misunderstood the story. Census taking doesn't lead to genocide, bad governments do and it's foolish to give them too much information.*  
Not every bad government wants to commit genocide, your application is too broad.

Well, in particular the UK government keep trying to commit genocide. And then they realise it's counter-productive.

&gt;*Is that why they keep applying internment?*  
Where are they applying it now?

1902, 1960 and 1971. The current wheeze is ['Offshore Processing'](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/world/europe/uk-migration-priti-patel.html). Did you decide to read the articles about 'codifying international law' instead that day?

Yes we do. And as I said covid completely overwhelms the health systems, creating problems for patients who don't even have covid.

&gt;Any sources on hospitals being overwhelmed?

I don't really keep a file and register all articles I read lol. But I read many ones about it happening in various places in r/coronavirus.

I don't even remember exactly when, but obviously before the vaccinations really kicked in. Like last fall I guess?

It has happend several times in Bulgaria. I heard about a woman that was at home for 2 weeks and nearly died at home - because there simply was no space in any hospital in any shape or form, even if she was in risk of dying.

&gt;I meant this only if the virus is something which constantly mutates as the vaccines wouldn‚Äôt be effective in that case.

No idea what that means.

&gt;Literally how is this any dumber than keeping restrictions that have already damaged the economy so much

Because hospitals can't say no to people who might die?

But OK, imagine we let people die in the street. Can you not imagine any negative consequences from that?

Like really picture in your head that you're in a situation where the newspapers title ""Governmet lets thousands of sick people die in streets. and ""Bodies pile up in parking lots outside hospital, but the door to treatment is closed!"". and ""Neighbors complain: The smell of rotten corpses is irritating!""

\-Of course, Germans would not say it directly, but if you read around a bit, you can see that this is a common German attitude and in general, Western European attitude especially towards the Eastern Europe.  
  
Well first of please show me proof that this is ,,common attitude'' lmao. And ,,common'' is pretty relative, dont you think.  
  
You really have a fucking problem with generalization.  
  
Thats like if I would say ,,Its a common attitude in poland to hate germans because of ww2 even tho nowadays these people arent alive anymore'' while in reality its just these two people on r/europe that said it under a ww2 post.

And furthermore youre literally not helping it. Youre just enforcing this ,,Easter vs Western'' bullshit by acting like everyone does it.

5929,"&gt;It's not complicated, Scotland and England are diverging politically and this is reflected in the voting patterns. You can point at macro events like the pandemic and recessions but the underlying trend is clear.

If it's not complicated like you say, then why are you repeatedly misunderstanding the fundamental dynamics between Scots and English people? Yeah, the trend is diverging, but it's not as if this hasn't happened numerous times before in the UK's history, divergence is built within the Union, for example Scots and English law being different from each other. 

&gt;If you are a unionist voting for independence as a protest vote, that makes you an independence voter. You're tieing yourself in knots trying to rationalise this.

But they're not voting for independence as a protest vote, they're voting for the SNP because they're another left wing party which is similar to Labour. 

https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/opinions/votes-snp-are-not-votes-independence

&gt;At this stage some Tories would love to see Scotland independent, it would lock in their majority permanently.

That *some* being no where near influencial in the party. 

&gt;Nevetheless the English vote is Tory and whipped, so from the Scottish and Welsh point of view it's just English Tory dominance forever.

Again you fundamentally misinterpret the way in which the country votes, it's not an ""English vote"" It's a south east English vote against the rest, who of which, up until recently, worked together to counter that. 

&gt;I think they pretty much are there forever. 

There's that complacency you're talking about. 

&gt;Your view is that SNP voters are confused Tories, that support for independence is because of Covid and Austerity and that there's a coming Labour majority that will heal all divisions.

Nope. Core support for independence will always be there, but to pretend that the COVID Brexit and Austerity and the Tory government haven't helped the Scotnats is naive, to think that a future Lab government wouldn't put a dampener on support for independence is also naive, and to think I said that the SNP voters are confused Tories is laughable. 

&gt;That kind of complacent view.

No, complacency is a view where you fatalistically presume the current government will remain in power forever and there's nothing nobody can do about it. 

&gt;Labour in alliance with ... SNP? I don't know where you're going to get the numbers from for a Labour majority.

Will never happen, and its arrogant to presume that someone who votes Conservative is a perpetual Tory voter. I don't think you understand what swing voters are. 

&gt;Typically countries have more control over their affairs than states.

Unless they're in a Union with another country and both are represented as one. 

&gt;Yes, she resigned. And breaking an arms embargo is small beer compared to disavowing the NIP and flouting the GFA. The USA didn't come over to actually read a demarch√© over the arms affair, did they?

You didn't ask that, you wanted me to point to you to where the UK broke international law, I provided it, but now it's *small beer* yeah, the Iraq-Iran conflict cost over a million lives, but to you, that's small beer, lol. 

&gt;Britain has an appalling human rights record, stretching back centuries and continuing right up to the present day.

Comparing Britain of the 1800's to the Britain of today is disingenious. Britain is in part responsible for codifying into international law rules of civilised behaviour whilst in combat. 

&gt;What about that European Commission of Human Right finding for use of torture and Britain's subsequent conviction. Another outlier?

Pretty much yeah. 

&gt;I think you may have misunderstood the story. Census taking doesn't lead to genocide, bad governments do and it's foolish to give them too much information.

Not every bad government wants to commit genocide, your application is too broad. 

&gt;Is that why they keep applying internment? 

Where are they applying it now?

&gt;Maybe they would only stoop to using it in the UK and not Great Britain itself? Bit of a gamble.

We've had internment in GB in WWI &amp; II for German and Italian people. 

&gt;How so?

Because Westminster and the respective parties are all aware of the issue of devolution and Scottish nationalism, its just that their execution of trying to stem the support of Scottish nationalists have been incompetent.

&gt;I've had personal experience of it not being accepted. Have you used Scottish notes in England?

I've accepted Scottish notes as payment personally, they're legal tender, it's just ignorance on it being refused. 

&gt;It's part of a pattern though.

No it's not, your pattern is one of sectarianism, where as we're (As in Scots and English) Are not that bothered by the naming.  

&gt;I don't think the next power grab is that far off.

You notion is predicated on a perpetual Tory government, which is flawed. 

&gt;It's comical rather than serious. Sorry about the breakdown of the UK though. It does actually negatively affect Ireland.

Rumours of the death of the UK are highly exaggerated

&gt;As usual, the constitutional implications just whoosh by.

We don't have a written consitution though. 

&gt;I've deomnstrated via Wikipedia how it was a French enterprise, I look forward to your alternate history

**Jacobite ideology originated with James VI and I, first monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1603.** Its basis was divine right, which claimed his position and authority came from God, and the duty of subjects was to obey. Personal rule by the monarch eliminated the need for Parliaments, and required political and religious union, concepts widely unpopular in all three kingdoms.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism)

No it'll be watered down and explained away as being ""effectively the same""

When their value on the battlefield diminished due to machine gun fire, artillery, tanks, etc, they were increasingly relegated to other roles:   
  
&gt; The military used horses mainly for logistical support; **they were better than mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain**. Horses were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers as well as for pulling artillery, ambulances, and supply wagons.   
  
---  
  
&gt; The value of horses and the increasing difficulty of replacing them were such that by 1917, **some troops were told that the loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier**. Ultimately, the blockade of Germany prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat. By the end of the war, even the well-supplied US Army was short of horses.
