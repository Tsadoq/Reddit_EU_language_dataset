Britain was involved in order to prevent or delay another European war that would be immediately triggered if German troops crossed the border into Czechoslovakia.  In fact, Chamberlain himself recognised that war had merely been delayed because immediately upon returning to London he ordered a massive increase in military expenditure.  He did that because he knew war was inevitable and that Britain’s peace time army was too small (Britain mainly being a sea power) and that France’s army was massive but had low morale and was built to fight a repeat of WW1. 

The reality at that time was that Czechoslovakia was a small landlocked cobbled together country with more than its share of internal ethnic separatist strife and which was surrounded by countries that had no intention of allowing its only ally (France) anywhere near it. That’s why Germany, Poland and Hungary all took the opportunity to have a slice of poor Czechoslovakia.",,/r/europe/comments/dbhjrf/on_this_day_81_years_ago_munich_agreement_has/f232z8g/,ShootingPains,1569904260

In a parallel universe he is probably getting blamed right now for not attending

To me it would have made no difference if the UK was there or not frankly - I seem to remember similar accusations that Western powers didn’t act quick enough in the Balkans - do Continental Europeans have this impression we run some sort of 24/7 “On Demand” pop-up military service for Europe ? no appeasement just full scale war whenever needed ? - that said its closer to the truth nowadays - “fool me once” and all that 

This was a contended piece of land from the start having only 15 years previous changed hands the other way - theres no chance in a million years the UK could sort this ongoing issue out diplomatically or militarily

I’m guessing Chamberlain thought his presence and in turn the UK’s involvement would be perceived as significant and put some weight on the agreement and pressurise Germany to prevent any more talk of war but Hitler simply ploughed on regardless so that was a waste of time

The story of magyarization is a great alibi though.

Hungarians protected Europe from the Turks (similar to how Viktor Orbán acts today), and after sacrificing so many lives, invited neighboring foreigners like Romanians to live there together. As a form of thanks, they ruthlessly took the lands away and oppressed the Hungarians, which still continues to this day.

208,"First, only 15 years earlier, the post ww1 great power treaties to break-up Germany and the HRE had involuntarily joined ethnically German Sudetenland to the newly created non-ethnically German Czechoslovakia. 

Second, unlike other regional ethnicities, the Sudetenland Germans were not given a local vote on their preferred allegiance.  It was seen as hypocritical for Czechoslovakia to claim that the assignment to it of the Sudetenland was moral because it was done by great power treaty, but that the reassignment just 15yrs later was somehow immoral because it was done by great power treaty. 

Third, getting British or French troops anywhere near Czechoslovakia would first require Britain and France to fight their way across Germany and/or Poland (keep in mind that Poland had already refused to allow French or German troops any transit rights).  All just to prevent one bunch of ethnic Germans from re-joining with Germany. 

Fourth, not many British voters were interested in spilling their own blood for a country that had only sprung into existence 15 years earlier and which comprised ethnic Sudetenland Germans transferred against their will and who wanted to be re-united with Germany.  That’s a hard sell for any government as a reason for going to war.

304,"Yup, that is correct. 

Charles V was the Spanish king during the time of the Spanish Netherlands, and was generally pretty well loved. Especially by William of Orange who grew up in his court and saw him as a father figure.  
When Charles died, his son Philip II inherited the throne. Him and William didnt much care for one another and Philip started ruling over the Netherlands with an iron fist, where under Charles they had relative autonomy under its nobles. 

Philip sent Spanish nobles to sit in the Dutch ""Staten Generaal"", which was the governing body, to press his wishes through.  
People started revolting and the Dutch nobles sent a couple ambassadors to Spain and appeal to the king, who had them beheaded.  
This caused the Dutch nobles to sign the ""Plakkaat van Verlatinghe"", a declaration of independence. 

The first plan was to offer the country up to a different king or queen, but France and England declined. When Spain heard the Dutch were trying to make a French noble their king, he offered him riches to undermine the attempt.

413,"&gt;Europe Has to Choose a Side in the U.S.-China Rivalry 
&gt;Beijing has a plan to divide the EU and keep it on the sidelines.

&gt;By Hal Brands
&gt;27. September 2019, 08:00 MESZ

&gt;Europe has been at the center of nearly every great-power competition of the last 500 years, either as home to one or both of the protagonists or as the decisive theater of struggle. No longer: The World Wars of the last century saw to that. Yet Europe’s nations are still capable of playing a critical role in the defining contest of this century: that between China and America. Or, they can allow the continent to be reduced to a weak, divided region that struggles to make its influence felt. 

&gt;China desires the latter, and has a strategy for achieving it. The U.S. should prefer an active and capable set of European allies, but its policies have too often played into Beijing’s hands.

&gt;The world's center of geopolitical gravity has been moving steadily eastward for decades. The Asia-Pacific now significantly outstrips Europe's shares of global GDP and global military spending. And although the rivalry between Russia and the West is significant, the trans-Pacific struggle between China and America is epochal.

&gt;Europe could be a critical swing power in that competition, defending the U.S.-led system that has benefited the continent so greatly. The European Union is still the world's second-largest economy after the U.S., no small asset in an intense geo-economic competition. A few allies - especially France and the U.K. - still are still somewhat capable of projecting global power, and a relatively rich Europe could improve its militaries impressively if it chose to do so. European countries can also wield considerable diplomatic influence, especially through the EU and NATO. Perhaps most important, Europe remains the most coherent group of democracies in the world, which counts for a great deal in a rivalry between a liberal and an illiberal power. 

&gt;There have been some moves toward greater European activism vis-à-vis China. The U.K. and France have sailed warships through the South China Sea in response to Chinese aggression. Germany’s leadership has become more concerned with Chinese human-rights violations and efforts to dominate high-tech industries. When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited France earlier this year, his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, said that the time of “European naiveté” on China was over.

&gt;The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has started to consider the idea that China is, as one strategy paper put it, “an economic competitor in the pursuit of technological leadership, and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance.” Proposals to strengthen scrutiny of Chinese investment and fortify European telecommunications, industry and innovation against Chinese influence and predation are gaining traction.

&gt;Similarly, Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, has warned that “China is coming closer to us” and called for increased European cooperation with U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific. Looking to the future, one can imagine Europe, the U.S. and the democracies of the Asia-Pacific cooperating to expose and counter Chinese political influence operations, and perhaps coordinating more explicitly on how to manage military threats in multiple regions at once. Yet the impact of European action on China will depend on how much unity the continent can muster, and on that issue there are signs of trouble.  

&gt;Even as some of Europe’s leading powers — Germany, France, the U.K. — have become more skeptical of China’s policies, many of the continent’s smaller, poorer members, particularly in the south and southeast, have come to see Beijing as a source of badly needed commerce and capital. In 2017, for instance, Greeks were more likely to name China (53%) than the U.S. (36%) as the country’s second-most-important partner, after the EU. A surge of political illiberalism in countries such as Hungary and Poland has created cracks in the continent’s democratic unity. Not least, the EU is on the verge of losing one of its most important members, as Britain moves toward Brexit. Europe has the potential to be an effective strategic player, but it may not have the cohesion.

&gt;This is good news for China. A cohesive, prosperous, democratic Europe will not take China's side in a contest with the U.S., because the fundamental clash between liberal values and Beijing's authoritarianism will stand in the way. A Europe that has thrived in an American-led world would not be particularly comfortable in a system led by a mercantilist China that demands strict deference from lesser powers. What China can hope for is a divided, dependent Europe - one that is unable or unwilling to side decisively with Washington because of its own internal rifts, decaying commitment to liberalism and reliance on Beijing's largesse. China can’t win Europe over, but it can neutralize it by fracturing the continent and co-opting some pieces. 

&gt;This is just what Beijing is doing. Following the precedent of its coercive economic behavior in Asia (chronicled by my colleague Dan Blumenthal), China has used the lure of trade and investment to discourage European countries from criticizing its political abuses at home or its policies overseas. China is cultivating the smaller, poorer and often less-liberal states of the EU to undercut European unity and improve its leverage with individual members. Beijing scored a coup this spring by inducing Italy to join its Belt and Road Initiative. Where economic influence goes, political and diplomatic influence will follow.

&gt;You might think that Washington would be responding by bucking up a democratic, unified Europe. Unfortunately, you would be at least partially wrong. The Donald Trump administration has pursued a typically inconsistent policy toward the continent, calling on Europe to get tough on China, even as the U.S. gets tough on Europe.  

&gt;The president and his advisers have vocally supported Brexit (even a “no-deal” Brexit in which the U.K. simply walks away), which will weaken the EU and remove a pro-American voice from that body. Trump and diplomats such as Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, have sought to empower illiberal populists across the continent.

&gt;The administration has forged closer diplomatic and military ties with Poland — which makes sense in terms of containing Russian influence, but not in terms of stemming Europe’s erosion of democratic values — and Trump hosted the decidedly illiberal Viktor Orban of Hungary at the White House. The president has spoken of the EU as a foe (“worse than China”) and used tariffs as a cudgel against European economies.

&gt;To be fair, the Trump administration has also tried to mobilize Europe against China’s geopolitical gambits. It has pressured European states not to partner with Chinese companies in developing 5G telecommunications networks, and called for NATO to play a greater role in meeting the rise of Beijing’s power. After initially resisting entreaties from Brussels, the administration now seeks to enlist the EU and Japan in a common front against Beijing’s unfair economic practices. Yet many European countries remain worried about aligning too closely with Trump against China, because they fear that he will eventually cut a bilateral deal with Beijing. Just as important, any U.S.-European cooperation against China is occurring in a broader context in which the U.S. has often worked against a strong and united Europe.

&gt;Trump has his reasons for this approach. He believes that the U.S. can get a better bilateral trade deal with a post-Brexit U.K., and seems to think that America can maximize its influence with individual European countries by weakening the EU. He surely sympathizes with those European politicians who rail against integration and globalism in the same way he does. This strategy may help him win some negotiations with European allies. It won’t help the U.S. win the higher-stakes game with Beijing.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/dbgbhf/europe_has_to_choose_a_side_in_the_uschina_rivalry/f21agju/,frbnfr,1569869878

PNL (national liberal party)- now the biggest party, is still corrupt but at least they don’t want to bury Romania in poverty. They are like the “necessary evil” since they are the only ones that can end PSD if USR don’t become big enough.

USR (Save Romania Union)- the new party that had seen an immense growth in popularity, especially form the young people and expats. They are totally anti-corruption and want to help România, but they still need a lot of work to do to gain more popularity.

ALDE- the PSD slave but they are not relevant anymore since it lost almost all popularity in at Euro elections this year.

PRO- another puppet PSD, not relevant.

\*The issue of repatriating these people has become such a difficult political issue that when government do anything, they prefer people don’t know about it because, in the majority of countries, public opinion is largely against bringing these people back.

For NGOs, working there is a very difficult task as well – Kurds don’t trust many organizations and restrict their access to the camps. I remember speaking to reputable organization such as UNICEF, Save the Children, MSF and they all spoke of challenges that ranged from actually accessing the camps to ensuring they had the personnel and the material to executing their work. Many of these organizations won’t even go on the record about it for fears of having their work further restricted (ie completely halted).",,/r/europe/comments/dbbz6b/im_anelise_borges_a_roving_reporter_for_euronews/f20pxwu/,euronews-english,1569862598

I find these two polls are somehow weird than my imagination. In fact each country especially industrialized one has some products among top-tier in a certain field.

Free will was certainly not a sin, it’s the entire point of humanity from the Christian perspective.

Inequality for women was not a result of Christianity, women were not the equals of men long before the Christian faith.

The feudal system too was not entirely a result of Christianity. It found its expression through the Catholic Church, but really it was a result of a power vacuum after the fall of Rome. While the Catholic Church perpetrated the oppression of the common people, that doesn’t change the fact that the teachings of Christianity ultimately lead to liberal ideas. 

In the modern day, we may be able to take the positives of Christianity and leave the negatives, but it doesn’t mean we have to underplay the role it played in furthering our civilisation.

690,"I'm hardly more informed in this than anyone else I can find in the street, so do bear that in mind.  

That said, it's more of an interior vs. coast line thing. Lisboa is the capital so it's obviously going to be the biggest economical center, but after that it's Porto, and while I don't live there I also get the idea that it's due to also being a more industrialized area. The south, in contrast, is much more heavy on the primary sector and tourism. Besides the usual tourist cities like Lisboa and Porto, we have Algarve which is the most famous beach region in the country. The primary sector in the south is due to being **much** dryer, which is why they they produce cork there (according to random sites off google, we export over 60% of the world's cork).  

Coimbra is without a doubt considered a coastal district and from what I know they are killing it in terms of medicine, so I imagine it's a very well off region. Setúbal I know very little.  

As for the southern part being richer, look at it less of North vs. Center vs. South and more about coastal vs. Interior. Porto is incredibly big but that seems to be the majority of what the north has to offer, because if you notice the area I'm talking about (the interior) coincides continues on in the same area of Spain.  

If I had to generalize, I'd say the south has tourism and the primary sector, the center (and Porto, as an exception) have industry, Lisbon in specific is the capital so it's obviously going to be different from the rest and the rest (interior regions, especially north and center) don't really seem to have anything to offer, so money (and thus development) doesn't flow anywhere near as much nor as fast.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/db7ugo/of_people_who_accessed_the_internet_at_least_once/f2081wm/,danidv,1569856434

A lot of people like to be a part of an exclusive group and keeping foreigners from learning their language is a good way of remaining exclusive and preventing undesired mixing. I wouldn't hold this against the Swedes if I were you. Think about it this way, it is their country and you moved there by choice, not because they forced you to go there. Thus you just have to deal with the Swedish quirks. You can't expect them to change their culture and behaviour and habits to revolve around you. When you move to foreign country, you try to cause the natives as little discomfort as you can and if that means not integrating into a social group because the locals don't want you to, you comply with that and don't force yourself upon them. Don't cause trouble and don't give the locals any kind of grief.

If the Swedes don't want certain people to learn their language, it is because they want to hold social events that foreigners can't participate in.

719,"&gt; I am probably more educated than you are but this is just posturing on  the internet so I will restrain myself from using that card 

That's fine. Let me entertain your non-posturing for a bit. Let's say that you are better educated, it stands quite clearly out that you however is not educated within a relevant field to this discussion. This is a very broad assumption; but as you are discussing within programming I assume that this is your field. That will give you a lot of knowledge about, well, programming. But it does not provide you knowledge on fields which we discuss.

&gt; You are arguing semantics and absolute definitions to support your  narrative which just makes you to look like an idiot but what do I care. 

This is one of the reasons I assume that you do not have a relevant education to this discussion. I argue with definitions because without them you cannot identify what ""communism"" or ""democracy"" or just about any other thing is. Definitions provides us with certain key points which repeats itself through different, in this case, regimes. Your definition of communism is apparently just that you pay taxes - do you see how ignorant a statement that is? If we lower it to that point then nothing would be communism, nothing would capitalism, or feudalism or any other thing - because we've lowered the requirements way too much. I'm probably wasting my time explaining this to you, for it's clear that you simply can't comprehend it.  

&gt; Yes communism is not just taxes  

Look at you! You are grasping at something here, well done.

&gt; your taxation and social welfare is stripping people of their freedom to vote with their wallet. 

You can perfectly well vote with your wallet. For instance Denmark, and probably many nations, has quite (economically) right leaning parties, which seeks to lower taxes. What you seem to miss is that many people has been able to move up in society because of free education. Many whom might have come otherwise poor families are now able to get what they might not have been able to otherwise. 

&gt; You probably would argue it gives one more freedom because you are not  worried about things but that's just simply wrong on so many levels that  I do not even feel like they are worth discussing. 

What ""things"" are we talking about here? You need to way more precise about your ridiculous statements, which you seemingly ""will not"" - more like ""cannot"" explain. As explained above, free education and a social safety-net means that people won't easily end up on the streets if they get into a bad economic situation. As explained above; free education allows people to move up in society, an opportunity they might not otherwise have had.  

&gt;You argue that social welfare is for the greater good of the society,  something that has been used by communists to push the same narrative. 

It certainly is better. I don't expect you to understand that though. I mean you lived through a communist state, which you didn't even understand. Hell, to this day some 30 years later, and you still don't understand jack shit about the state you lived under. Your complete misunderstanding has left you with the delusions that you now believe that every nation on the entire globe is ""a little bit communist"". I don't even think that you understand just how pathetic and Eastern European that comment is! Yes, it was an argument pushed by the communist, but elsewhere it was pushed by social democrats in cooperation with other parties. I could probably find an equally lame argument about practically any other regime form and you'd say ""BuT iT wAs InItIaLlY PuShEd By BaD pEoPlE, sO wE sHoUlDn'T uSe iT."" Find a better argument, for since you apparently is better educated then you should easily be able to find something better than that. 

&gt;Because someone else (the party, the government) knows better than you!

The government in any democratic, modern nation is a part of the people, and not some far away elite. The idea is that you redistribute the wealth in society so that it's a more equal society. There's not extremely far between the ordinary to the rich in Denmark. It's the opposite in for instance USA where the rich as infinitely more than the ordinary person. You can be against that if you wish, but I like it. It means that it's not just the wealthy, but the ordinary person who can gain prominence in the higher echelons. 

I understand that you are against any sort social welfare because you in your ignorant opinion believe it to communism. That you still don't understand what communism means despite having lived through is another thing. But it also skewer your view towards welfare - you simply believe it to be bad. Yet many of the countries with Social Welfare is doing very well both economically and socially.

810,"Some context from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_Germany,_Prague): 

&gt; In the eve of the Revolutions of 1989, the palais became the resort of numerous East German refugees who had reached Prague, climbed over the fence and camped out in the grounds. While there were small groups hiding there occasionally since the embassy was opened in 1974, the number rose to several thousands in September, causing serious problems of supply and hygiene.
&gt; 
&gt; Behind the scenes the West German government negotiated with East German authorities and the Soviet Union how to solve these worsening conditions. When Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in the evening of 30 September stepped on the balcony to announce an agreement on the refugees' voyage to West Germany, the crowd cheered on the keyword Ausreise (departure). This event marked an emotional and significant moment in German history.
&gt;
&gt; Until 3 November when the East German authorities closed the border with Czechoslovakia, many more GDR citizens fled to the embassy in the following weeks, wearing down the patience of the Czechoslovak authorities which gave in eventually, letting all East Germans travel directly to West Germany. Thus, they broke their part of the Iron Curtain, the Czechoslovak border fortifications during the Cold War. On 9 November 1989 the Berlin Wall fell, and the Czechs would succeed in the Velvet Revolution.

Whatever they have been doing, it's just a start and they need to do much more.

The EU single-use plastics ban was based on evidence, not only feelings. they counted the actual pieces of plastic waste on hundreds of European beaches and those are the ones banned.

Reality is very often different from what the map shows.

We have chemical and biological weapons to worry about, too. Not to mention massive incendiaries—“daisy cutters” and the like—and the knowledge and ability to create firestorms (like what has already been done in Dresden and Tokyo).

Here’s another cheery thought: blow up some massive bombs in the middle of the ocean and create a “hypercane” that lasts for weeks or months.

1129,"The main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. Nearly all of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labour camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. More than 85,000 Orthodox PRIESTS WERE SHOT in 1937 alone. Only a twelfth of the Russian Orthodox Church's priests were left functioning in their parishes by 1941.

In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500.

1132,"You are quite right that what you felt was real and in-action by visiting the US. But you are confusing anecdote for reality. You can have experience AND have the wrong understanding. Those 2 are not mutually exclusive. 

I also will be more cautious and pay more attention to be surrounding when I’m in a non-conforming place. In fact all humans are. What we feel does not translate to the actual reality in major way though. In the wake of 9/11, middle eastern nations had to give travel warning in western nations. It sounds weird because you don’t expect it. 

Of course people in NY are more likely to be wary of guns and shooting than most other places (although saying ‘no other major city in the world’ would feel something like that is showing a bit of that Eurocentrism). A tsunami warning in Tokyo and a tsunami warning in Portland are *gonna* be seen with vastly different seriousness. 

People usually ask “have you traveled” as point of inexperienced person thus non-serious opinion which I think is wrong. For what’s it worth, the only place in Europe I have ever visited was Greece for work related- but I have been to Vietnam, China, Japan, Thailand And Colombia extensively multiple Times and I must say- I did not get smarter the more countries I check off. 

If you want my biased opinion of Europe, I think Europe is better than America. But that’s only because I lean heavily left on economic policy. It’s my own bias. 

Does Europe have better culture? No. Tradition? No. Does it ‘feel’ more “relaxed”? No. But is it better? Yes. I would pick Europe over America to live in. 

As for your question about military, guns, etc. I would love to ban guns. Guns are only here to stroke egos of some fatass redneck trying to see if he’ll get to kill a robber once in their life and be a hero. No fatso will be taking their .34 and winning any battle with US army. 

Again, your experience are not invalid. In fact, I am agreeing that Europe is safer statistically, and thus you would feel much much more relaxed there for any number of reason. What I’m rebuking here is the America part of the equation. 

The average American is by universal law “stupider” than the average European in politics because US being the largest economy/military speaking English means a European will know about it. But an American won’t have a medium or reason to understand or care what’s going on in say Poland. But is this unfair? Is an ant more profound than an elephant because the ant knows the elephants existence but the elephant does not know the ant? 

The same principle of why you decided that “guns”=“bad” or the clear private property laws (even scary sometimes) = “bad”. Are you not basing American cultural, political, and traditional law and legality from European point of view? 

If majority of Americans decide that Gun Rights are more important than Free Healthcare- and majority of Europeans decide the opposite- Why would you assume one of these is the right opinion and other is wrong? You may think “well I mean it’s obvious healthcare is more important!” But is that because you were born in that team and were brought up in that society? Because if it was that obvious, why would More Americans not also embrace the obvious option? 

What I’m asking is, why do you assume beforehand that the basis for happiness, or “relaxation” is tied to aspect of European way of life? Could an American just as easily find his happiness and relaxation in American way of life?",,/r/europe/comments/dawfdg/why_are_europeans_so_much_happier_than_americans/f1yogpw/,NokDor,1569820823

1232,"At what point are you actually saying something *bad* as opposed to something *different* ?

Like most of you’re examples of “paranoia” is basically just advice? Like is it paranoia to tell a tourist in Germany not to show off swastika? Or is it a paranoia to tell them not to take picture with someone shown or even someone’s house for privacy? It’s a very real thing I see Europeans doing and (for some reason- only with America). Japan is a pretty weird place but it’s seens as “different culture, tradition “ rather than “different from Europe thus bad” that America gets. There is no connection between paranoia and religion yet because you gather Americans are more religious and Europe is being more atheist- now is the “better” and other is paranoia. 

People welding flags but hating government is not in any way shape or form related to paranoia or “badness” in any context. 

I think I’m lots of ways. It’s that way of thinking in double talk (sorry but I’m gonna go a bit deeper here)- where people unknowingly try to insult something in double way in which the second insult can only come if the first one is incorrect but the person does not realize it. For example- insulting that Americans have no culture and then going in in detail about everything wrong with American culture. McDonalds is not culture, it’s fast food- but this 2000 BC toilet Alexander used is Culture, but also let to tell you have the influence of Fast food and such have ruined people’s life style and traditions (but also it’s not culture!)

You do that here: “ The police can be considered a joke (bullies that shoot first, ask questions later) “ that doesn’t seem like a joking police. A joke police would be one that asked question, doesn’t get it,  says “ok” and leaves. A police that shoots you first would hardly be called a JOKE; but you cannot day “the police are hardcore/strong/forceful/ because they shoot first” because those words invoke a slight compliment while “joke” says the police are stupid, lazy, unknowing but also second insult of “they shoot first”. 

Think of it like this: you’re pony of Americans being paranoid directly contradicts another American stereotype of always smiling and out going and loud and annoying and obnoxious. Here, the stereotype of ‘American’ is insulting in both completely opposite directions where only one can logically be right. 

Even the TV Medicaid ads: Americans manage to overdose in opioids, have TV ads for drugs like candy, get prescription at ten fold the levels of Europe- BUT also, Americans can’t afford the medication cause shitty health care, so I guess the TV ads are for just shits and giggles. 

In fact- this is not For America only. Anyone with a bias for anything will eventually do this. This is just a case study of how bias blinds us to believe something when it’s not true BUT the real driver is the cognitive Dissonance- it’s a way for us to feel good. It’s the reason why Russia is a crumbling poor state AND a global power projecting, election milipulating, super power. Why Germany is a leftist hellhole but also trying to make the 4th Reich.

People don’t think this when they insult but in many ways- it’s weird how the human brain can make the most innocent thing look bad in comparison. Someone said- “gauging how bad America is by looking at how many drug ad you get is like gauging Canada’s plastic supply by how much bagged milk are sold”.",,/r/europe/comments/dawfdg/why_are_europeans_so_much_happier_than_americans/f1ybdg6/,NokDor,1569813195

Smart people, yes; rich people?

This has nothing to do with wealth. Do you think poor people are better off if rich people are less healthy?? Do you think poor people at better off if rich people are stupider? These aren’t legitimate complaints, this is just jealousy. It’s not a zero sum game.

[Here's a cheap as free to access table indicating the fate of those guys mentioned in the article I provided, by the way.](https://i.imgur.com/T0gHUTh.jpg)

Also, here's [another page](http://www.deathcamps.org/occupation/einsatzgruppen.html) referring to how people could get out of perpetrating atrocities against civilians if they bothered to. Some choice quotes:

&gt; ""During the war a person could at least try to have himself transferred from an Einsatzgruppe. I myself managed to do this successfully… I was not demoted as a result of my transfer and not disadvantaged, apart from remaining on very bad terms with Heydrich until his death. There were without doubt cases where people who were transferred from an Einsatzgruppe suffered disadvantage. I can no longer recall individual cases. None the less, as far as I know, nobody was shot as a result."" - Dr. Franz Alfred Six, in charge of Vorkommando Moskau of Einsatzgruppe B

&gt; ""I do not know of or recall any order that stated that SS chiefs or members of the SD or the police would be sent to concentration camps if they refused to carry out an order. I also never heard of such an order during the course of conversations I had on the subject or indeed from rumours."" - Erwin Schulz, head of Einsatzkommando 5 of Einsatzgruppe C

Everything has been razed to the ground by nazis, and i mean 99%+ of everything was wiped out clean from the face of the earth. So while we have like galleries and castles its all fake, or imported. Nothing authentic remains. 

Also because its so big by our standards traffic is a nightmare. 

But if you are looking for a place to party with locals, get slammed, and most modern minded people, yea thats probably the best city in the country, but by no means good. 

I recommend Kraków which was our former capital, and also was not completely ruined by nazis and commies during and after the war. Also Toruń, Poznań, stuff like that. But honestly not to undersell my country, but i dont think there is anything particularly amazing that we have to offer, i guess nature is pretty cool and sea at summer is alright, and mountains arent awful, but as far as cities go, i cant see why you wouldnt go to Lviv, Prague, Kiev, stuff like that. 

Also in case this is relevant, this is a very bad time of the decade/century to be openly gay person in poland, especially smaller parts of it, so if you are one, or like wearing the symbols and loudly supporting the LGBTQ, i recommend you dont come or hide it well and keep your mouth shut.

They may be big if Austria alone is viewed, but there are literally around 50 cities in Germany as big or bigger than Salzburg (the smallest of the three).

The frescoes represent several episodes of Papal superiority over monarchs in history, hence it was kinda conceived to troll and intimidate the guests. Scenes include: the Turks losing at Lepanto (1571) + King of Aragon brining tribute to Pope Innocent III (early 1200s) + Charlemagne confirming the possession of the Papal States to Leo III  (c.800 AD) + Frederick Barbarossa accepting the terms of the Peace of Venice by Pope Alexander III (1177) etc etc

The hall is a product of several artists, notably Giorgio Vasari but also Livio Agresti and Taddeo Zuccari.

1651,"The biggest difference between Poland and those western countries is industry. Italy has some famous companies or brands such as Leonardo, Union Credit, ENI oil, Fiat, Alenia, Ansaldo, Ferrari, Fincantieri, and north Italy is known for excellent small-sized machinery manufacturing industry, Italy produces some best machine tools in the world as far as I know Danieli is one of them. 

As for Spain, it has some well-known international companies such as Group Santander, BBVA, telefonica, ACS, iberdrola, Repsol, Cepsa, Gamesa, Gestamp, Mondragon corporation, Grifols, Navantia. Spain also makes some of best machine tools in the world, as factory of Airbus 350 using M.Torres AFP device. And Spanish railway CAF and Talgo are strong competitors of Siemens and Alstom. 

I have not heard any famous Polish company until now. The population of Poland is 38M, Spain 46M, Italy 60M, but the latter two have more famous companies. I think the driving core of economy is always manufacturing and high technology. In terms of GVA per worker, Poland is still far lower than the west. 

In every west country you can find at least one or two excellent enterprises which is/are among top-tier in the world. For instance, Swedish Volvo and Sandvik, Finnish Nokia, Wartslia and Walmet, Dutch Phillips and ASML, Swiss Roche, Novartis and Rolex, UK’s Rolls Royce and GSK, French Safran, Renault, Thales, Alstom, Danish Danfoss, Vestas, Novo Nordisk.

1663,"The way state treats its citizen's citizenship status isn't really regulated on international level as much as on national. Each country can handle it differently, for example the US allows an individual to have multiple citizenships including US citizenship, but it legally recognizes only the US one disregarding any other. Other countries such as Japan allow only one citizenship, and you have to give up either the Japanese one or any other. All in all this means that you're primarily at the mercy of the country, and if you lose your last citizenship, you become stateless and there's little you can do about it. No international law can really help you much at this point as far as I know. In normal circumstances countries usually have a law that prohibits you from giving up citizenship, if it's the last one you have, you must have at least 2 citizenships.

1801,"There is no simple explanation as to why the madness of nazism spread among what was at the time maybe the more civilized nation on Earth.

As to the state of mind of the individual soldier, it is of course difficult to comprehend or even imagine.

One clue is the fact that the units involved in this massacre were *Einsatzkommando*. Follow the various links above to try and understand how those were selected, trained, indoctrinated for this kind of outcome.

Another clue might be given by the famous [Milgram experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) regarding submission to authority. See also the infamous [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment).  

For a pop-culture approach, the most excellent 2008 film [The Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_\(2008_film\)) explores how quickly extremism can spread through an initialy benevolent group of teenagers. Itselft based on a true story.

Indeed, in democratic countries, soldiers are somewhat informed that they have the right to disobey blatantly illegal orders, but are rarely, if ever, actually *trained* to behave accordingly. If the humanity has not observed any organised genocide on the scale of the Shoa since WWII, many an attrocity commited by military forces have existed even in recent times.

Then, of course, one has  to consider the *zeitgeist*. At this point in History, lines of thoughts such as racism, eugenism, social darwinism and of course antisemitism traversed societies, even the democratic and pacific ones, even those that were not engulfed as deeply in economic and political crises as Germany in the twenties and thirties.

From the mere tactical side, 1941 was close to the high point of nazi military successes, and when a system works so well, there is little incentive for anybody to question it.

Finaly, speaking of *system*, once a social organization is designed, crafted and put in motion, it takes a tremendous opposition to stop it, regardless of the individuals engulfed therein.

I don't know if in other countries there is a ""adult"" tax. But at least were I live taxes are not related to age. They are based in economical activity. You pay taxes when you buy/sell things, when you own things, when you work... etc

Yo, to be fair even a 10 yo could pay taxes, when you buy anything you pay taxes with the price. And in most countries 16 yo is the legal age for work, yo a 16 yo could be paying much more taxes than a 40 yo.

Even then if you want to go on the ""pay taxes with their own money"" route. A 10 yo could made more money by itself on a lemonade post than some rich spoiled old men who got his money by inheritance. 

What I mean is that there's no logical way to establish a fair line with the ""only vote if you pay taxes"" and much less to linked it to the age of a person, there are many people who doesn't pay any direct taxes in their whole life (and indirect taxes are paid by anyone who buy things).

&amp;#x200B;

I could go similar with the ""brain full of idiocies"" (in my experience an idiot at 16 is probably still an idiot when he reaches 50), or the ""life experience"", also in my experience (ironic) I don't usually see people in their 50 taking better decisions than people in their 16, in fact in some ""shady"" industries older people are usually targeted for scams above younger people as they are easier to trick for some things.

There's also a bigger problem with bio-plastics made from plants (corn, sugar, etc). It's very intensive on the farm land. Farming products lots of Co2 and uses lots of water as well. So bio-plastics aren't the end all be all.

Of course, if you go down to the dirties, Russia is an all-important provider of petroleum and natural gas, a developing market with a lot of untapped opportunities for European industries.

Russia is also a key player in the global effort to remedy the global climate catastrophe.

Hence, it is of course fundamental to develop a relationship between the people of the Union and the people of the Federation that goes beyond and around Влади́мир Влади́мирович Пу́тин.

2227,"&gt;As Germany is investing in more renewable energy it has the ability to shut down some of it's old power generators. 

That is what we are doing.

&gt;It had a choice between shutting down coal/lignite or nuclear and choose to shut down nuclear.

We shut down plants that are to old.

&gt;That means they effectively choose fossil fuel over nuclear.

That is correct.

&gt;Renewable energy like solar and wind rely on backup generators when there is no sunlight/wind, and those will likely be powered by fossil gas.

That is somehow correct, Gas is used for backup, but the no wind scenario is never happening, call is less wind and mostly compensate with over capacity. The same with sun during the day.

&gt;Since Germany is also invested in the Russian Nord Stream pipeline, that Gas will most likely be from Russia (who will use it to blackmail Germany politically).

No Germany didn't pay a cent NS2 and is the only country which doesn'T partially owns the Energy companies involved for it. So France, UK, Netherland or Austria have far bigger involvement in that. German Government is for NS2.

I addition most of Germany Gas use goes to chemical companies and heating, a reason Gas demand didn't increase by much the last years.

&gt;For the climate it doesn't matter where the gas comes from though, it's bad either way.

natural gas emits far less than hard coal or lignite. So it is far better.

&gt;It would have been much better for the climate, the environment and the economy if Germany shut down the lignite power plants first, once you had no more coal power plants you could shut down the nuclear power plants if possible.

IF possible and if you ever had seriously study Germany energy generation, you might see that Germany is turning off their windturbines as they have overproduction, because the Grid is not there. Guess where most nuclears reactors are, not where the lignite plants are.

here is a wonderfulmap showing the problem, our energy grid is not ready for it.

If you want to know where the other ones were.


 &gt;Now you are stuck with coal, lignite and gas for a long time.


2038 if it is after our current federal government. My federal state will faze out coal by latest 2023 and some neighboring federal state want to do the same. 


You can be for nuclear, I personally have less problems with nuclear, but we didn't shut down our nuclear reactors prematurely and we couldn't replace the lignite plants with it. We should have build some back them, but that's a total different discussion.

To compare countries, the absolute numbers of deaths across Member States need to be adjusted to the size and structure of the population.

At EU level, the rate of deaths from coronary heart diseases stood at 1 190 deaths per million inhabitants in 2016. This was a decrease of 14% from 1 390 deaths per million inhabitants in 2011.

Men died more often from coronary heart diseases than women, with 1 620 deaths per million men compared to 870 deaths per million women.

 With 5 610 deaths from heart attacks per million inhabitants, Lithuania registered the highest rate among the EU Member States in 2016. It was followed by Latvia (4 000 deaths per million inhabitants) and Hungary (3 670).

At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest rates were recorded in France (470 per million inhabitants), the Netherlands (580) and Spain (640).

 In every EU Member State, the standardised rate of men dying from coronary heart diseases was higher than for women. Among the EU Member States, Lithuania recorded the highest gender gap with 2 950 more male than female deaths per million inhabitants from heart attacks.

Trump's people met with rich and government connected Russians over 140 times during and after the campaign.   It was all in the Mueller report.  

The problem is people are not talking so they cant get the full info for what was discussed at every meeting.  
Trump Jr. was caught lying about one of the meetings before the election was over.  Trump Jr first stated it was a meeting about adopting Russian children.  Then Mueller discovered that the meeting was about getting info about Clinton from the Russians.    

The claims were not made up.  It is possible that Trump's team failed to get good information from the Russians but it is 100% fact that they at least tried to get help from Russia for their campaign.  We just dont know how successful or unsuccessful there were in getting help from the Russians.

2528,"&gt; You're insane if you think voting for the establishment does anything other than entrench the establishment. 

No, what’s insane is thinking that left winger en masse not voting will somehow magically shift the party to the left. 


&gt;You have a servere case of pundit brain. 

By “pundit brain” do you mean reality? 

&gt;This type of tactical voting is exactly what happens when you embrace electoralism without any meaningful organizing.


This type of voting is the only way to shift the country in the way you want. That’s why right wingers do well in elections and why Democrats shift right to get people who will actually vote.

&gt; That you will vote for the furthest left candidate, even if it's a conservative like Clinton is exactly what the DNC bets on in order to maintain the status quo their big donors want. 

Hillary is not a conservative, I don’t know why you people think that Hillary wouldn’t, for example, get rid of Citizens United. 


&gt;That's why they felt comfortable running Hillary, and it's why they'll feel comfortable running Biden ør some other shill like Warren.

Clinton won the primary because you idiots didn’t show up to support Bernie. It’s not about wether the DNC is comfortable running someone, it’s about people showing up to vote. If your type couldnt even show up in the primaries, why would you show up in the general? 

&gt; Think about it. What you're saying is that the Dems don't have an obligation to campaign for the left if they want to win, 

Them being the most left wing party should make them the obvious choice.


&gt;but that the left has an obligation to vote for candidates that don't represent them. 

Yes, left wingers have an obligation to support the most left leaning candidate of their objective is to make the country more left wing. I am more to the left than any Democratic candidate since FDR but I also understand that by doing some dumbshit purity test that will just enable the right to win. If the left doesn’t vote then the Party will shift right PERIOD, end of story. You might not like it but that’s reality.


&gt;Does that sound like a winning strategy to you? You might as well tell the left to go fuck themselves.

Yeah, some of them can go fuck themselves. In 2000, left wingers thought the exact same as you that both sides were the same and decided to vote third party. More than 100,000 people voted for the Green Party in Florida alone. Al Gore ended up losing by literally 600 votes. If even .6% of those people had an IQ over room temperature, we would have had Al Gore as president.


Because of people like you, we got two unfounded wars in the Middle East that killed 100,000’s, $4 Trillion tax cut for the rich, a massive debt because of those tax cuts despite being handed a surplus, compete degradation of the environment, a global financial meltdown, extreme attacks against gays and other minorities among every other shitty they done. Remember the Supreme Court? Bush got two picks and when Citizens United, that allowed corporations to put UNLIMITED amounts of money into election, every Democrat voted against and every Republican voted for. Because of people like you, Bush got that legalized.


All this for why? Because they accused fucking Al Gore (the well known environmentalist) of all people of not being environmentally friendly enough. 


&gt; Just don't be shocked if Trump wins again. 

I won’t be shocked, I know that even if Sanders were the nominee, people like you would play the both bullshit game and hand the country off the fascists like you guys normally do.


&gt;Trump IS really unpopular, but the Dems also can't help but keep making the same mistakes.

If you bomb a target you think might contain a person you want to kill and in fact that person is not there, and it is just a bunch of civilian noncombatants, then you bomb the funeral of those civilians in the hope that a person of interest might be there and again just kill a bunch more civilians, you might think your approach has a problem.

Currently US policy is fine with this. As long as there is a chance that a target might be there its fine to kill tons of totally innocent people in the hopes of getting a given target.

This would probably fall in the category of positive punishment, which is **adding** something annoying or uncomfortable. The opposite punishment, negative punishment, is **removing** something enjoyable.

It's possible you could argue that this punishment is a little bit negative punishment and a little bit positive punishment, but it's a punishment either way. I learned this well through training dogs, in which we were strictly told to only use positive reinforcement if possible, and if not possible, use negative punishment. The reason for that is that they is the most humane of the conditioning tools. They also work very well on dogs and children, and some times even adults. Although you must be more sly with adults as they can understand what you are doing a lot easier.

2678,"No what you are actually saying is you don't like the actual facts on hand or care about the mountains of evidence about the civilians being murdered as a direct result of the policy.

""United Nations human rights concerns
On 3 June 2009, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) delivered a report sharply critical of US tactics. The report asserted that the US government has failed to keep track of civilian casualties of its military operations, including the drone attacks, and to provide means for citizens of affected nations to obtain information about the casualties and any legal inquests regarding them.[149] Any such information held by the U.S. military is allegedly inaccessible to the public due to the high level of secrecy surrounding the drone attacks program.[150] The US representative at UNHRC has argued that the UN investigator for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions does not have jurisdiction over US military actions,[149] while another US diplomat claimed that the US military is investigating any wrongdoing and doing all it can to furnish information about the deaths.[151]

On 27 October 2009 UNHRC investigator Philip Alston called on the US to demonstrate that it was not randomly killing people in violation of international law through its use of drones on the Afghan border. Alston criticized the US's refusal to respond to date to the UN's concerns. Said Alston, ""Otherwise you have the really problematic bottom line, which is that the Central Intelligence Agency is running a program that is killing significant numbers of people and there is absolutely no accountability in terms of the relevant international laws.""[152]

On 2 June 2010 Alston's team released a report on its investigation into the drone strikes, criticizing the United States for being ""the most prolific user of targeted killings"" in the world. Alston, however, acknowledged that the drone attacks may be justified under the right to self-defense. He called on the US to be more open about the program. Alston's report was submitted to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights the following day.[153]

On 7 June 2012, after a four-day visit to Pakistan, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for a new investigation into US drone strikes in Pakistan, repeatedly referring to the attacks as ""indiscriminate,"" and said that the attacks constitute human rights violations.[154] In a report issued on 18 June 2012, Christof Heyns, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, called on the Obama administration to justify its use of targeted assassinations rather than attempting to capture al Qaeda or Taliban suspects.[155]""",,/r/europe/comments/dakth0/danish_officer_meets_obama/f1r8e23/,bouncedeck,1569712427

2697,"&gt;Lol. The economic uncertainty caused by neo-liberal economic policy is why people are gravitating away from it, 

Don’t forget any time a lefty tries to change it, people who are even more left wing says “both sides are the same” and ends up causing no change to happen.


&gt;and the reason they're going right is because the left has been demonized for decades. 

The left has been demonized by the right for decades. Right wingers cause problems and then blame left wingers or immigrants or minorities and end up being elected.


&gt;The reason Trump got into office is because the DNC nominated a hugely unpopular neoliberal candidate who ran a horrible campaign. 

Clinton won the primary by literally MILLIONS of votes. Should they have just scrapped the vote and went with the person who lost? Maybe the far left should get off their ass and vote?

&gt;And they'll do it again, and again people like you will blame the left rather than take any responsibility.

2737,"&gt; It is all ""we need to do better and this will kill the internet"" without solutions themselves.

Oh but there were solutions! A lot of them in fact:

https://juliareda.eu/2018/09/copyright-showdown/

Personally I have found ""S&amp;D MEPs Wölken, Stihler, Weidenholzer together with individual members"" to be probably the best of all, both from financial and technical perspective. 

I just disagree with the CURRENT one but that's not to say there weren't solutions that I couldn't agree with. 

&gt; Content ID has cost them something like 100 million over the years? Tiny stuff for them. 

More specifically, it shows what 100 million $ buys and that it's actually very immature. It's also the kind of money that can be spent on such purposes by what, 0.1% of companies?

&gt; I disagree. I think there is enough room in there that says: try the best you can, but we reserve the right to pressure you to do more.

Catch is, again, that this directive does not state this. There are no hard numbers in there, goals, examples and penalties. ""Best effort"" is simply not defined enough, especially when it isn't connected to company's revenue (you can't seriously be expecting a small blog to implement same level of filtering as Google). 

This is all left to individual member states. Except since internet works globally then frankly you only care about ""the worst"" possible variant which is a bit stupid too. This should have been a regulation instead, working identically across whole EU and being fully defined from the get go.

It's also worth keeping in mind that UoE actually owns an enormous number of buildings in central Edinburgh (being around for 500 years is a pretty good way of accumulating assets), so I suspect they take a pretty hands off approach to vetting events happening in buildings they don't directly manage.

2812,"Considering the LGBT movement is still quite recent, 50% is a pretty great percentage, especially for a country like Estonia since it’s still developing. Something like LGBT acceptance isn’t a day long movement, it takes several generations to get to a point of overall positive outlook and acceptance towards the populous. 

Most countries throughout the world at the moment aren’t really looking at a great trackrecord. The ones listed below are only a select few. 

USA-35%/40%    Disapproval
Britain 18% Disapproval
Italy 18% Disapproval
Greece 40% Disapproval
Poland 46%
France 22%
Germany 11% (Great)
Etc. Europe is overall doing extremely well in regards to LGBT acceptance, countries such as Finland, Sweden, etc. 

So shitting on a country because their LGBT acceptance isn’t at 100% is ridiculous to say because absolutely no country in the world is at 100% at the moment. I measure a countries progression by their economic and social development over the years, how quick they’ve progressed as a society is a great indicator of how good they’re doing. It means their social educational movement is working extremely well and people are open minded to new ideas. You’re pretty ignorant in this regard.

You judge a country alongside people by how they’ve changed. Also, before you decide to shit on me, I’ve ran large projects based on LGBTQ acceptance in my organization which has held extremely large and successfully educational LGBTQ rallies for over 20 years now(: I’ve ran these rallies all over the world, primarily third and second(developing) countries. Our movement has been extremely successful into educating the general populous of these countries into become more accepting. 

A rough percentage example I can give you of a developing country, our work has brought the country from a 10% approval 10 years ago to over 30% atm!

2817,"&gt;In order to support that extra weight, railroads would need to accept 22.5 ton/axle load, but many french and eastern-european rail lines only have 20 or 18 ton rating and to upgrade (replace) the steel rails and track foundations and ballasting would cost uncountable huge sums - and completely unnecessary at that, since the 25kV/50Hz AC system is superior in every aspect.

First off: this is a misrepresentation of the situation - because most tracks that suffer from this problem were never intended to be used for international transport or are not electrified in the first place. You don't need to make the entire french and german rail network multi-system-compatible to run international lines. As evidenced by Thalys, ICE, TGV, ECE, EC etc. which all run just fine without switching engines. 

&gt;Yet, Germany, the leading force in the 15kV, 16 2/3Hz gang, doesn't want to convert, because 25kV standard is historically associated with the arch-rival french state railways...

The reason Germany doesn't switch plain and simple is because you casually dropped that it'd require Germany to switch out their entire current electrified fleet, including the currently ordered trains. For someone who diminished upgrading the tracks for the axle load based on the ""uncountable huge sums"", thats for sure a hell of a thing to forget.

&gt;The big obstacle is Germany and his 16.7Hz AC gang

Again. No. The big obstacle for international travel in Europe is the extremely low amount of access points across borders because most border crossing railroads got abandoned or closed and demolished in the last 70 years. France and Germany for example share a grand total of 2 non-trivial railroad connections actually viable for High Speed travel - Both in Strasbourg. 1 more if you count the route via Belgium throgh Aachen/Aix-la-Chapelle. 

The only points where your axle-load/power supply essay actually is important are small, electrified, cross border railroads which use two different systems. Which are few and far between. If you're going to bring plane travel and HSR into this then acknowledge that HSR prepared railroads are easily able to support the axleload of multi-system-trains and already do so.",,/r/europe/comments/dadsya/length_of_national_highspeed_rail_networks_in_the/f1qb7vj/,LightningEnex,1569697222

And finally in terms of debt to GDP (which is what you like to look at), France is just as deep in debt as Spain, the UK is close and Germany is faring better but still at a 60%, which is not low. (Italy is in deep shit) [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269684/national-debt-in-eu-countries-in-relation-to-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)

So besides Italy, which has gone totally nuts, there is not a huge difference between the big economies, and Germany is the only big one who can argue that their GDP is huge and bleh... But let's not forget that when the European Central Bank started buying national debt Germany went all in, and is right now, by far, the biggest debtor to the ECB. Which is ironic considering it was one of the countries more opposed to said policy. I think they owe half a billion euros (the real billions, yknow, 10^12), which is somewhere around 40% of Spain's GDP.

2843,"&gt;This has been debunked time and time again. It's not that simple.

Okey, to be more specific then:

* first, you need to have a commercial site
* second, it has to be older than, if I recall, 3 years

If these 2 conditions are cleared then someone posting a copyrighted content on your website may end up with you being sued. Well, with a caveat - current mechanism to this is take down. If a copyright owner contacts you - you have to get rid of it and sometimes share information on who uploaded it. 

New mechanism is stay down. What has been once reported to your website as infringement should never show there again. Which is... not exactly possible. Everyone working as a programmer can tell you this. This law change is supposed to have a proportionality included into it (so steps that YouTube has to take should be totally different than a small local forum) but we only have 1 year left until it becomes a law and there are no details yet... and in fact I am expecting said details to only surface after first lawsuits. Hence this law is extremely scary (I mean, this IS preventive censorship as best and cheap filter I can think of is to only let specific people from a whitelist through and block anyone else by default) and is why there were hundreds thousands people on the streets regarding it.

&gt;Nobody will do it, because there is money to be made with an audience of 500 million people you are otherwise shutting out. 

That depends solely on one factor - are you capable of fullfilling these regulations? If yes and it costs you less than said 500 million people - you stay. If not - you leave. 

&gt;This narrative how we should not do regulation because small publishers  will suffer is also pushed by the giant tech companies, because they  themselves don't want regulation 

Oh, I am not denying that! I am just pointing out that the suggested law changes will only make it worse, not better. Right now you can for instance read someone's article and go ""hey, I like it!"" and post it on Reddit with a summary on what is it about. Under article 11 and 13 - you pretty much can't. Reddit will HAVE to treat you as a potential lawsuit coming. As maybe you have copy pasted parts of that article (without author's consent obviously) in your promotional post for instance. Big publishers are in a safe situation, they can easily make and prove their identity to other news aggregators. But smaller ones? This is going to be a nightmare. 

I guess there is one possible positive outcome from this (unlikely to happen but hey, gotta stay positive) - decentralization. If huge portals like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook etc will have issues with keeping with this law (and they honestly might, YouTube's Content ID is the most sophisticated solution on the planet and it might very well be deemed insufficient) then there is another way - make your own site with your own content. Put a ""free to use/link by everyone"" license on it. Boom, done, you don't give a fuck. Admittedly under this kind of ruleset you could also re-create said Twitch as a hosting service. Give people bandwidth, tell them to use their own domain name and make them agree to ""we can link to your website stream, group it within other ones that we find similar etc"". In fact in a way that's what MIT's [Project Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/) is doing to an extent. You store your own data and just let other places use it on your terms.

2878,"Well the first two points don’t matter because while the UK has double the net debt of Spain, its economy is also twice as big. 

Debt per capita is also a bit of a false comparison, because you can compare the per capita GDP of the UK vs Spain/Portugal and its about a third bigger.

In either cases though the UK and Germany are both economically more efficient than Spain, not to mention that Spain has one of the worst demographic profiles of the richer EU nations. Certainly worse vis-a-vis the UK and France. This makes the debt burden fall much heavier on the economically productive working classes in Spain versus the UK or France, and even Germany which tends to get many immigrants.

So in pretty much any respect sadly the Iberian peninsula is an economic laggard compared to the Northern European nations.

Depends on the material. Images and text is pretty easy. Video is harder. But it still doesn't impact smaller websites since:

&gt;In determining whether the service provider has complied with its obligations under paragraph 4, and in light of the principle of proportionality, the following elements, among others, shall be taken into account:  
&gt;  
&gt;(a) the type, the audience and the size of the service and the type of works or other subject matter uploaded by the users of the service; and  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) the availability of suitable and effective means and their cost for service providers.

So if no suitable means are affordable to you, the situation basically stays the same. Small websites really have nothing to fear over this all. It is about large platforms that now hide behind the current laws to not tackle the abuse going on when content creators want to protect their works.

&gt;That depends solely on one factor - are you capable of fullfilling these regulations? If yes and it costs you less than said 500 million people - you stay. If not - you leave.

Their shareholders will force them to find a way in this. Google, Amazon, etc, are not going to stop being active in this market, leaving the door open for competitors to take over.

&gt;Right now you can for instance read someone's article and go ""hey, I like it!"" and post it on Reddit with a summary on what is it about. 

Reddit is actually one of the worst abusers of the current situation. We have people copying complete articles from behind paywalls and Reddit does nothing. It is good things like that are going to change. The internet has grown up, this stuff was coming all along. On tv, radio, newspapers, you need to be sure you can use every little fragment you show. Somehow on the internet it is a free for all. It was never going to stay that way. What is going to be interesting is where the balance will be found. Maybe we will go from one extreme to another for a bit.

&gt;Big publishers are in a safe situation, they can easily make and prove their identity to other news aggregators. But smaller ones? This is going to be a nightmare.

Identification of websites is done mostly through text files that smaller publishers can easily manage. Google has just implemented a new line for the robots.txt files it crawls that lets you set the settings. It's pretty easy.

&gt;If huge portals like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook etc will have issues with keeping with this law

If that is true, then maybe they are not ready to manage these platforms and need to set some limits. We are more and more seeing downsides of Youtube  and Facebook especially. The free for all model hasn't worked. So should we just leave them to it until they say they have a solution? That has been promised for years, and it is still not solved. At some point, you need to put a stop to it and just demand better.

I just think people are focusing too much on the narrative of small publishers being hurt. They are already hurting so much from the business practices of these tech companies, getting those tech companies under control a bit is not going to make the difference for them. The issue for them is not regulation, it is income. And Google and Facebook basically hoard all the money from the online advertising economy these days. Putting a stop to what the can rip from others and get away with is better for all in the long term, even if it might hurt some in the short one.",,/r/europe/comments/dajg8x/google_to_stop_showing_news_snippets_for_french/f1qddsy/,cissoniuss,1569698544

Basically it means that money spent on plane tickets is money spent inefficiently, because of extra emission taxes. However, taxes are proven to work for steering market behaviour. Expenses for plane tickets compete with any other expense.

""some""

The church of Greta is constantly going around preaching about the end of the world. It's ridiculous and honestly leads people to believe climate change is inconsequential because of those exaggerated ravings and is a media campaign. It's a viral marketing campaign, not a lasting political movement. And the former falls apart as quickly as it came about as soon as the media has something else to write about. All fridays for future people that came out of Germany are ultimate upper class hypocrites and you can't build political pressure with people like these. People get hyped for a short amount of time, but that hype dissipates as quickly as it came about and never leads to real action.

&gt;Terrorism is not even remotely as severe of a problem.

Terrorism in itself isn't. THe reason why it exists is though. The radicalization of the Islamic world, over a billion people, is definitely worrysome, because it brings war and destruction. 

Except for the Mexican drug war all major wars and all current wars are existing because of Islamic radicalization. And dozens other conflicts are around because of it. And this radicalization is in turn helping other radicals. The Identitarian movement and modern White supremacy is a direct mirror image of Islamic radicalization. Their biggest recruiting tool is the existence and spread of Islamic radicalism.

Firstly, it's generalizing that ""they are unintegrated"". There are also many, especially among the youth, who are very well integrated.

Secondly, treating them as ""us"" is part of the integration effort. This does not mean that we need to, I don't know, change Estonia's perception of Soviet occupation or anything, but it is an attitude that, in principle, seeks conciliation and common ground.

&gt;there's a Estonian, who wants to take this responsibility for them... 

I want people to take responsibility for their actions, but also our society for our problems. This, in no way, means I would somehow take responsibility for some Stalinist crime or such shit, but it does mean treating our current problems as *ours*, which applies to all fields starting from integration and crime rate, and ending with urban planning.

Thing is, even in those European countries where there was actually terrorism, it was never a huge actual risk for the general public. In Spain in the 1980s, or in France in 2015, orders of magnitude more people were killed or maimed in traffic accidents than by terrorism. I wasn't afraid because I was a ""tough boy"": I was afraid because there wasn't much to be afraid of (please note that this is different for people who are **actual designated targets**, like anti-independence Basque politicians in the 1980s, or the Charlie Hebdo staff in 2015: they had **plenty** to be afraid of, they were the tough boys who braved an all-too-real risk).

Why is there such an exaggerated perception of risk in the countries least affected by terrorism, then? Well, there's an obvious reason: because of how this risk has been presented to them. The survey shows the impact of almost two decades of propaganda: the overlap with the ""New Europe"" of the 2003 ""Coalition of the Willing"" to invade Iraq is quite striking...Using the (real or imagined) threat of terrorism to demonise some scapegoat, including whole ethnic or religious groups, isn't exactly new: just read Joseph Conrad's ""The Secret Agent"", written at a time when anti-Semites thrived on the fear of anarchistic terrorism.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/d9wpz7/which_of_the_following_do_you_consider_to_be_the/f1oswrf/,Rc72,1569661447

For example the treaty between Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Denmark, Russia and the United Kingdom to not recover the wreck.

Or the refusal to recover the corpses at their relatives pleading.


But either way, even if there's some secret reason to bury the wreck, it'll just be something secret being transported that they didn't want someone to recover.



Typically after such a wreck the corpses are indeed recovered, and sometimes even the ship floated for accident analysis.

That treaty is the weird part.

And the argument that it's for piety reasons just doesn't count: The titanic was visited by robots several times, and hunting wrecks for historical or financial reason is a common part time.



But either way, there's nothing else to this 'conspiracy'. The ship had a know weakness in the bow-'door' and the Mayer Werft Had plans to reinforce the bow visor.

No ill play was necessary for this boat to sink in an orcane.

3475,"The situation in the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia had been tense since the end of the 1980s when the anti-Soviet, Georgian opposition began demanding independence from the Soviet Union. In March 1989, Abkhaz nationalists demanded in the Lykhny Declaration the official establishment of a separate Soviet Socialist Republic (based on the precedent of the existence of a separate Abkhazian SSR from 1925–1931, which was associated with the Georgian SSR by a confederative ""Union Treaty""). The Declaration was signed by the rector of the Sukhumi University. Ethnic Georgian students of the university announced protests, but these were forbidden by the Georgian government. Nevertheless, the students rallied and were attacked by ethnic Abkhazians. The Georgian anti-Soviet movement was outraged by the event and included the claims of the students against Abkhazian secession into its list of slogans by several thousand Georgian demonstrators in Tbilisi. In response to the protests Soviet troops were dispatched to Tbilisi, resulting in the April 9 tragedy.

In June 1992 the tensions over autonomy approached a critical stage, when Abkhaz militants attacked the government buildings in Sukhumi. On 23 July 1992, the Abkhazian government proclaimed the independence of the region, though this was not internationally recognized. On 14 August 1992, Georgian police and National Guard units were dispatched to restore government control over Abkhazia. The ranks of Georgian troops were filled partially by ""emptying the jails"" as some of the inmates were released on the condition that they fight in Abkhazia. Fighting broke out the same day. On 18 August 1992, the separatist government fled from Sukhumi to Gudauta. Georgian government forces subsequently captured large parts of Abkhazia.

Significant ethnic cleansing accompanied by atrocities occurred on both sides with Abkhazians displaced from Georgian-held territory and vice versa. Many human rights abuses, principally looting, pillage and other outlaw acts, along with hostage-taking and other violations of humanitarian law, were committed by all sides throughout Abkhazia.

On 26 August armed Chechens fighting for Abkhazia captured Valery Maliuk from Eshera, just because he expressed his sympathy to Georgians. On the same day they raped Georgian teenagers, and along with the Abkhaz militants, committed atrocities against Georgian civilians in the village of Ordzhonikidze.

On 3 September 1992, a ceasefire was negotiated in Moscow. According to the agreement, Georgian forces were obliged to withdraw from Gagra district. The Georgian side carried out the implementation of the agreement and left its positions. As a result, the local Georgian population of Gagra remained defenseless. The ceasefire was soon violated by the Abkhaz side. Thousands of volunteer paramilitaries, mainly Chechens and Cossacks from the militarized Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus (CMPC) and the Abkhaz military, equipped with T-72 tanks, BM-21 Grad rocket launchers, Sukhoi Su-25 attack planes, and helicopters. Georgia accused Russia of supplying this equipment, as it had not been previously used by the Abkhaz. Abkhaz and CMPC forces attacked the town of Gagra on 1 October. The small Georgian force remaining in the town briefly defended Gagra before retreating, then regrouped and recaptured the town. The Abkhaz and CMPC forces reconsolidated and launched another attack, capturing Gagra on 2 October. The Russian navy began to blockade the seaport near Gagra.

Thousands of Georgian soldiers and civilians fled north, entering Russia before being transported to Georgia proper. With the Abkhaz conquest of Gagra, those who remained were forcibly expelled, and a total of 429 were killed. One Georgian woman recalled watching her husband being tortured and buried alive.

Chechens and other North Caucasians rounded up captured soldiers and civilians at the local stadium and executed them. Some were decapitated and their heads were used to play football.

After a failed attempt to storm Sukhumi from the west, the Abkhaz formations and their allies diverted their offensive on the northern and eastern sides of Sukhumi. On 2 July 1993 under Russian military directives and naval support, the Abkhaz and their allies attacked the villages on the Gumista river. The Georgian side didn't expect any offensive from the northern or eastern side of Sukhumi District. The Georgian forces suffered heavy losses (as many as 500 dead within an hour of the attack) and the defensive line around Sukhumi was breached by the Abkhaz offensive. On 5 July 1993, Abkhaz, Armenian Bagramyan battalion, Russian and North Caucasian detachments stormed the villages of Akhalsheni, Guma and Shroma of Sukhumi district. The residents from the villages were rounded up and massacred.

On 16 March 1993, at 6 and 9 am the Abkhaz and the Confederation forces launched a full-scale attack on Sukhumi resulting in mass destruction and heavy casualties among civilians. At 2 am the Abkhaz side began artillery bombardments of Georgian positions at the Gumista River and Sukhumi. Later in the day several Russian Su-25 planes attacked Sukhumi through the morning of the next day. A Russian special detachment led the operation followed by Abkhaz fighters and CMPC volunteers. They crossed the river Gumista and took part of Achadara, but Georgian forces successfully stopped their advance.

On 14 May, a short-lived ceasefire was signed. On 2 July, Russian navy ship landed up to 600 navy ""desant"" - Russian Airborne Troops close to the village Tamishi, and engaged in a fierce battle with Georgian troops. The battle was one of the bloodiest in the war, with several hundred killed and wounded on both sides. Despite initial setbacks, the Georgian forces managed to retake their positions. In July, Russian detachments, Abkhaz military and CMPC volunteers captured the villages of Akhalsheni, Guma and Shroma of the Sukhumi region. The fiercest struggle was in the village of Kamani, defended by the Georgian National Guard and battalions of armed Georgian volunteers. After several hours of combat, the village fell. During the following two days, the Abkhaz engaged in a campaign of systematic torture, rape, and murder against Kamani's civilian population. Nuns at the church and the covenant were raped and killed in front of the Orthodox priest, and the priests were then taken outside, briefly questioned on the ownership of land in Abkhazia, and murdered. Approximately 120 Georgians were killed in the Kamani massacre.

Another Russian-mediated ceasefire was agreed in Sochi on 27 July and lasted until 16 September, when Abkhazian separatists violated the agreement (citing Georgia's failure to comply with the terms of the agreement) and launched a large-scale offensive against Sukhumi. During the siege, Russian MiG-29s dropped thermobaric bombs on Georgian residential districts in Sukhumi and Georgian villages along the Gumista River. Russian journalist Dmitry Kholodov stayed in Sukhumi before it fell, and reported that the city was repeatedly shelled by Russian forces, causing heavy civilian casualties.

The 1994 U.S. State Department Country Reports also describes scenes of massive human rights abuse: ""The Abkhaz separatist forces committed widespread atrocities against the Georgian civilian population, killing many women, children and elderly, capturing some as hostages and torturing others.... They also killed large numbers of Georgian civilians, who remained behind in Abkhaz-seized territory....The separatists launched a reign of terror against the majority Georgian population, although other nationalities also suffered. Chechens and other north Caucasians from the Russian Federation reportedly joined local Abkhaz troops in the commission of atrocities.... Those fleeing Abkhazia made highly credible claims of atrocities, including the killing of civilians without regard for age or sex. Corpses recovered from Abkhaz-held territory showed signs of extensive torture (the evidence available to Human Rights Watch supports the U.S. State Department’s findings).""",Georgia,/r/europe/comments/da8bx2/26_years_ago_sokhumi_capital_of_abkhazian_ar_fell/f1oonc3/,Spredde,1569654769

3550,"For some backstory:

&gt;Last year, he [Georgian president Zviad Gamsahurdia] hammered together a coalition of nationalist groups and led it to victory in the first contested elections in the history of Soviet Georgia. The new parliament promptly elected him president. His portrait hangs in many Georgian homes, out of respect and hope that he will lead the nation to prosperity and independence.

&gt;Yet to many outsiders, Mr. Gamsakhurdia is a dangerous man. Russian democrats and Western diplomats generally scoff at Kremlin accusations aimed at the republican nationalist movements. But for Mr. Gamsakhurdia's authoritarian brand of ethnic populism, they make an exception.

&gt;They are alarmed by his intemperate remarks against other nationalities, by his harping on what seem to be the special rights of ethnic Georgians in Georgia, by his habit of labeling competitors ""criminals,"" by his moves away from local democracy and freedom of the press.


&gt;Moreover, he argues, excessive tolerance for other nationalities is a luxury of big countries that Georgia cannot afford

&gt;""And the Georgian nation is in danger,"" he declared. ""We must save Georgia.""

&gt;If before the election he sometimes spoke for a law banning mixed marriages, he now says he believes that ""patriotic education"" may be sufficient.

&gt;Census statistics provide little support for his claim. In 1939, according to the official count, there were 2.2 million Georgians in all of the Soviet Union. In 1989, the official count was just short of 4 million

&gt;The nation-in-danger argument can be heard in many republics and reflects understandable fears for any relatively small ethnic group. But Mr. Gamsakhurdia's concern about the fate of small nations emphatically does not extend to the minorities in Georgia.

&gt;Take the Ossetians. In the midst of a volatile interethnic conflict, the Georgian president did not avoid inflammatory language.

&gt;""The Ossetians are direct agents of the Kremlin, tools and terrorists,"" he told The Sun. ""Ossetians have no right to that land. They are newcomers.""

&gt;Pressed to define ""newcomers,"" he said the Ossetians had arrived in ""the 18th, 19th, 20th centuries.""

&gt;Was it fair to call people who had lived in Georgia for decades or centuries ""newcomers""? Yes, he insisted. Did that mean the Ossetians should leave Georgia?

&gt;""They have an historical homeland -- North Ossetia,"" he said, referring to the autonomous republic across the border in the Russian Federation. ""It is their homeland."" He implied, though he did not state, that the 164,000 Ossetians in Georgia should head for ""home,"" leaving Georgia to the Georgians.

&gt;Such language is not limited to the Ossetian question.

&gt;Speaking to the Times of London in December, he included Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who together make up about 20 percent of the population of Georgia, as a threat to the Georgian nation. He said ""most of them"" were ""enemies.


https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1991-03-07-1991066043-story.html

&gt;According to George Khutsishvili, the nationalist ""Georgia for the Georgians"" hysteria launched by the followers of Gamsakhurdia ""played a decisive role"" in ""bringing about Bosnia-like inter-ethnic violence.""

&gt;On December 27, 1991, U.S. based Helsinki Watch NGO issued a report on Human Rights violations made by the government of Gamsakhurdia.[14] The report included information on documented Freedom of Assembly, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press violations in Georgia, on Political Imprisonment, Human Rights abuses by Georgian government and paramilitary in South Ossetia, and other human Rights violations.

&gt;After taking Sukhumi, Georgian forces (including Mkhedrioni paramilitaries) engaged in ""vicious, ethnically based pillage, looting, assault and murder."" In addition to the looting, Abkhaz cultural monuments were destroyed in a manner that, according to some reports, suggests deliberate targeting. University buildings were sacked and museums and other cultural collections broken up. The irreplaceable Abkhaz national archives were burned by Georgian troops, reportedly, local firefighters didn't attempt to douse the blaze. A family of Abkhaz refugees from Sukhumi claimed that drunken Georgian troops broke into their apartment firing automatic weapons, and telling them ""to leave Sukhumi forever, because Sukhumi is Georgian."" According to the family, the Georgian soldiers stole jewelry, assaulted the husband, and then threw them all out into the street. The same witnesses reported seeing dead Abkhaz civilians, including women and elderly people, scattered in the streets, even though the fighting had ended days before.

&gt;70.000 is 70.000 too much

As is for homicides, tax evasion, unemployment, kids with measels. But small numbers can be dealt with without panicking and going for counter-productive measures.


&gt;Opinions like yours lead to the rise of the far right and are putting the EU. Illegal immigration IS an issue.

No, it's the complete disregard for the *dimension* of an issue and *real impact* of measures that lead to far right. Nobody is denying that it's not an issue in general, what is being denying is that it is an emergency with such large impact and costs, and that the proposed measures help at anything at all.

3604,"I'm not going to pretend I know the specifics of what happened during the ousting of Yanukovich or what is required to legally remove a prresident in Ukraine. I do know that the parliament declared he was out and acceted the elections for a new president, but whether they did all they needed to I really can't say. Not that it matters because neither coups nor revolutions give foreign countries the right to annex territory. Russia still invaded, it is still an act of war and it was still illegal under international law. Nothing you've said changes these facts.

And if Russia's goal was to support Yanukovich and restore the proper, legal government I got to say annexing territory is a VERY weird way to do it. Almost like Putin had some ulterior motives.

As for your final paragraph, it's a trainwreck. Russia's war against Georgia and its superiority to Ukrainian forces is somehow justifying the invasion? Great, let's just all give the Americans whatever they want, after all they do have the world's most powerful military and might makes right. If China's military keeps growing in strength until it surpasses all others and they come knocking demanding all of Manchuria from Russia that means the Russians should meekly give it up. What is this argument even supposed to mean.

Second, underdogs. By your own admission Russia is far more powerful than Ukraine, the rebels have full Russian support and have had the upper hand for 5 years. In what universe are they underdogs, and how in the world is it relevant to anything. 

And finally, if you're going to make the argument that Ukraine's forces disregard civilians and use human shields while the rebels and their Russian allies do not, source up. I have never read anything about a marked difference in disregard for the rules of war between these two, and it seems more than a little fishy that the illegal invader is somehow acting like a paragon of virtue. And again, if you do have evidence for Ukrainian war crimes, that could at most be used as a justification for resistance to Ukrainian forces, not Russian annexation of territory.",,/r/europe/comments/d9wpz7/which_of_the_following_do_you_consider_to_be_the/f1oazqa/,Kripox,1569639572

They had no right to out him without impeachment procedure.. which they didn't go through even months later when loyal to the legal president forces either fled to Russia, were massacred at the south of the country or successfully rebelled at the east of it. So, country to which all deals were made by other countries were essentially no more. The illegitimate government had no claims on the territories that they controlled, nor on the ones uncontrolled by them. International community, being USA's bitches that they are, pretended like nothing major happened. Russia on the other hand, as legal successor of the USSR has all legal claims on those lands, duh.

The thing is, nobody believed in Yanukovich's abilities to lead his nation once more, not Russians, nor Ukrainians. His decision to flee was his demise as a leader and as a politician.. But he really didn't care, all he wanted to was to safely spend the money that corruption brought him during his rule.

No, Russian war in Georgia, which (Georgian army that is) has the experience to fight against bigger odds for centuries in their fortress-mountains should show you that Russian army that decimated Georgian army in 5 days could bring Ukraine to the knees in relatively same schedule and if the civil war in Ukraine goes around more than 5 years than that means that Russian army doesn't help rebels. It's just that fucking simple, lol. They are underdogs and will stay as such. The relevance of being underdog is that many people globe wide want to participate on the losing side of war due to thrill of it, so they are going there to help rebels.

Well, for starters google (or better yet watch on youtube) what happened in Odessa (where pro-russian civilians that organized peaceful meeting were en masse raped, shot and burned alive by nationalists aided by police forces) and Mariupol (where Ukraine's military opened fire on thousands of civilians and when local police refused to do the same - opened fire on police stations too). Google how Ukraine's military send their troops like lemmings to slaughter into the well-defended rebel positions.

You have not substantiated that. You keep repeating yourself. Let me reiterate: they do not represent the majority of socialists in Europe.

People can be against sanctions for other reasons except ""because it offends my political allies"". Those sanctions are an answer to the nationalised oil. Nationalising oil with a corrupt government is not such a good idea, but it's fronted as a chief reason why things are going bad. Using that logic Norway should be just as messed up. Sanctions can also hurt the poorest of a country. It's a form of inaction, I agree - but I can't condemn people for having that opinion.

3832,"&gt;It enables huge multinationals to avoid paying their fair share

The fair share of everyone, corporations or not, is a 100% land value tax, a hefty carbon tax and perhaps some other pigovian taxes like on cars, cigarettes and drugs. Currently, no country has implemented a 100% land value tax. But not only that, countries can also levy a tax on land regardless of tax havens as long as the country has a land registry, since land cannot be hidden or moved.

&gt;""With its tax policy, the Netherlands perpetuates poverty and extreme inequality in the world - a world in which the richest 62 people now own as much as the poorest half of the global population. It is also thanks to Dutch regulation that multinationals are able to avoid at least USD 100 billion in taxes in developing countries every year.""

3849,"There's so much about the US economy that is completely exaggerated online. Allow me to show you. 

The US labor working time averages are the same as Europe roughly, [see the BLS stats here](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat22.htm). In addition the common talking point that lots of Americans have multiple jobs is also wrong. &lt;5% of people have 2+ jobs in the states. And this statistic is complexified by gig economy. People can be working 40h a week while still having 2 jobs. the idea that most people work 50-60 hours a week is wrong. 60h especially is uncommon, a 50h work week wouldn't be uncommon in a sufficiently competitive career, but that's also true in Europe. 

The US has a pretty competitive working culture. It's true there are lots of people who just clock in, do their work, and don't go the extra mile. But there are tons of Americans who love to compete to get a better job, better money etc. and going that extra mile is quite common. Having a job that either pays shit or you don't like is viewed as a negative and most people try to push for a better job. 

Nurses are typically not contacted after working hours by law, however, in emergent situations(bombings, mass shootings etc.) most medical professionals can be called into service. Doctors can be on call of course, however, that's in most countries. A ""call schedule"" doesn't really exist in most job except ones that regard national security situations like the energy sector, healthcare etc.


The memes about the US online are largely wrong. The statistics prove it. Which is why the European confusion as to how Americans aren't constantly protesting exists. If things were that bad, then most people would be protesting. The reality is that people working 60h weeks are an extraordinarily small portion of the working population. Most people make decent money, have good work hours, and like their healthcare(statistically speaking). That doesn't mean that we shouldn't work on fixing healthcare or that the US labor situation is positively perfect. it just isn't the hellhole that people think it is from casual speech online.",,/r/europe/comments/da2tia/the_countries_with_the_best_worklife_balance/f1ntbpr/,Deadassskillz,1569625762

Worse, we are importing electricity from other country. I can't find a current energy distribution, but we have been reliant on importing electricity for a long time (in 2017, we could only supply 70% of our own electricity consumption). So renewing/rebuilding our NPP is necessary. The government's official goal is to go half-and-half, with nuclear and solar together, hoping to get to the point of exporting electricity rather than importing. 

I am on the opinion that nuclear power is largely good for the environment (and this has a lot of qualifiers because it is not a simple yes/no question) and is complementary to renewables rather than necessarily directly competitive.

*Economic* migration and naturalization, on the other hand, can be controlled by setting out certain requirements, such as skills currently needed in the country.

It's about solar, wind, hydro, etc. not being good at maintaining base levels of power generation.

Solar ""has trouble"" at night, wind when there is no wind, and so on: which power are you going to use in those cases? Some people argue for batteries, but it is ludicrous with the current technology to think that you can store many GWh of power for those situations when these unreliable sources will not be available (even neglecting how amazingly polluting current batteries models are). At that point, it's either suffer blackouts whenever there is not enough renewable power, dust off the good old fossil fuel plants... or use nuclear. 

We need nuclear to act as the carbon-free backbone of our power generation, for those times when renewables are not available. You would essentially have enough renewable power to work with at their peak performance, but keep multiple nuclear plants on ""stand by"" (producing low amounts of power) to be switched on fully when the available renewable power drops. Once it's morning again, or the wind starts blowing, you decrease nuclear power output again. That way, you avoid producing a single gram of CO2. 

As I said, right now the other (realistic) options are either blackouts or fossil fuel power plants.

4130,"The are a few points to consider.

* Ireland is geographically isolated from the rest of Europe and cannot rely on many of the infrastructural benefits Europe has, such as the highly interconnected rail network. Due to our history with Britain, since independence Ireland has had to rebuild its economy almost from scratch since Britain gerrymandering the island to allow themselves to keep the our heaviest industrial region, Northern Ireland. Ireland doesn’t have an auto industry. We don’t have a shipbuilding industry. We don’t have oil. We don’t have steelworks. We didn’t have the benefit, unlike many European nations, of spending several centuries conquering and plundering colonies. How do we now compete with the likes of the UK, France, and Germany? With tax incentives. Tax was agreed, by every member of the EU, to be a member competence and not a shared competence. We haven’t done this as a dirty trick behind anyone’s back. We are now and have always been quite open about how we compete with larger economies. If you didn’t like it you shouldn’t have agreed to it when you negotiated with Ireland over the Lisbon Treaty, the Nice Treaty, etc. I might point out that most EU members didn’t even consult their own voters when ratifying those treaties: perhaps in many a government’s pursuit of political expedience and convenience, they robbed themselves of a proper debate on the best direction for the EU they were creating?

* Ireland has no special love for multinational corporations. Our challenge of the Apple tax bill is not because we pity Apple or because we sycophantically want them to love us. Multinationals love nobody and nothing other than money. Ireland is challenging the bill because our ability to attract business is highly dependent on our reputation for stability and predictability. If we say your tax bill will be X, your tax bill will be X. We can’t afford to have a reputation like the UK’s where we’re perceived as overhauling our entire economic status and screwing entire industries over, just because the ruling party needs votes this election cycle. That’s a toxic reputation we wouldn’t survive. We want businesses looking at setting up shop in Ireland to be confident in their five year-projections. Yes, we had some tax loopholes and yes, they needed closing, but closing them retroactively is how you get a bad reputation for instability.

* Ireland didn’t go crying to Brussels during the eastern accession when a swathe of Eastern European nations joined and suddenly a large chunk of Ireland’s manufacturing industry picked up and left for Poland because wages were cheaper there. That’s just business. Ireland will never be able to compete with Poland on those terms and so we don’t try to. You just have to use what you have. Once the economies of those Eastern European nations become wealthier and COL rises to be more in line with Western Europe, unionisation will ensure that there’s no more race to the bottom. But until then, we have to accept the fact that as a relatively wealthy nation, we’ll be taking some of the economic burden of making Eastern Europe as well-off as the rest of us. They’ll take those industries so we need different industries, and that means multinationals because every time Ireland produces a successful company, a bigger company from America or Germany or somewhere else that’s rich comes along and buys the company. Maybe if we’re all so concerned about how we’re forced to compete with each other, Europe could start getting more aggressive in its antitrust laws so that established companies can’t gobble up all the fledgling companies any more, but if we did that it would affect the bottom lines of mammoth companies like Lidl and Aldi and they produce too much revenue for *countries that actually matter* and so that’ll never happen.

The fact is that the EU members are all still in competition with each other and if tax harmonisation happened tomorrow, the larger and more established countries would have absolutely no problem with suddenly getting all the investment, as they would believe that’s “only fair”.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/da1h8o/ireland_not_good_eu_citizen_says_economist_joseph/f1mwd9a/,LeoBravo,1569603583

It was just my own grandmother who lives still, that lived in colonial times, where the japanese did everything to destroy korean culture and language.  

And those kinds of wars were ongoing since the 1600s.  

Thankfully, we are all business and smiles, but there is nothing that riles up a korean more than korean domination vs anything japanese in competition.  

The hatred runs as deep as members in middle eastern areas, or perhaps deeper, as in ancient korea, joseon, the only real countries we had relations with were the japanese and chineese.  Maybe vietnam, but why go that far?  We love staying home safe.

Everything else I have read says it's the other way around:
&gt;""The European Union remains steadfast in its support to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The  German Foreign Office said that Germany and France also condemned  Putin's decree, adding that these regions are part of Ukraine's national  territory.

If you are an immigrant, legal or not - there are no super duper social welfare programs just for you.

And they don't give a f*** when fuhrer Merkel scream to microphone that veryfying someone age is racist an demand immediate action that might compromise citizen safety to take hot potato out of her hand.

So if immigrant, legal or not want to enter Poland - they can. Via proper channels just like everyone else. Then he need to find a job and work. The biggest assist he can count on is assist in finding work.

And because of that. Poland is not that attractive. Because immigrants have to work. If they stay unemployed like in France they will be hungry.

There was a case when immigrant family landed in Poland. One of the first. Everyone in the city were exciting that they could help.

Germany has a good combination of very well maintained roads (compared to other countries) and a lot of dedicated bike paths. By a very wide margin, cycling infrastructure was better than in the parts of France I cycled (the coast), Italy (coast to Genoa, up to Milan, then on to Como and over the Alps), and definitely Monaco (which has no cycling infrastructure and bans bikes from some roads).

As for public transit, I know where you are coming from. If you spend every day on the trains, you will hate them. But they are better than almost any European country I've been to and definitely better than Canada and the US. I would even rate them as better than Japan because Japan only really has a great network along one corridor. Germany has a very extensive network of public transit.

I don't care what you heard and where. In this case we have evidence to support such claim.

&gt;And my point is that is obviously only tied to the duration of their power. The Left folded in 1939, so did the Red Terror. 

Red Terror mostly ceased after first months of the war. Nationalists continued to the end of the war and after it.

&gt;The White Terror lasted until 1945. If you are going to use the upper estimate for the White Terror, you should at least also use the upper estimate for the Red Terror, you could have chosen either the 70k or 110k for that. Both the 55k and 70k seem to be equally argumented, while the 110k for the Red Terror seems excessive and biased. 

Fine. You want exact numbers? 127 431 on Nationalist side, 49 272 on Republican side DURING the war. Those are not estimates but numbers proved by thorough research.\*

I would also suggest to you to read the new world nuclear report that was released just a few days ago: https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/-World-Nuclear-Industry-Status-Report-2019-.html

It shows how the whole industry is dying and why it's actually bad for fighting climate change. (Because it's so expensive you would get more CO2 reduction by spending the same amount of money in renewables.) In fact, just the part of the power plant that generates the electricity is more expensive than renwables now:

&gt; Newer technologies do not change this: in the latest nuclear designs, so-called Gen‐III+ reactors, ~78–87 percent of total costs is for the non-nuclear part. Thus, if the other ~13–22 percent, the “nuclear island”, were free, the rest of the plant would still be grossly uncompetitive with renewables or efficiency. **That is, even free steam from any kind of fuel or fission is not good enough, because the rest of the plant costs too much.**",Europe,/r/europe/comments/d9y20j/german_poll_majority_rejects_recent_climate/f1m2sif/,linknewtab,1569582097

&gt; The average age of EdF’s fleet of 58 reactors was 30 years in 2015.

&gt;The 900 MWe reactors all had their lifetimes extended by ten years in 2002, after their second 10-yearly review. Most started up late 1970s to early 1980s, and they are reviewed together in a process that takes four months at each unit. A review of the 1300 MWe class followed and in October 2006 the regulatory authority cleared all 20 units for an extra ten years' operation conditional upon minor modifications at their 20-year outages over 2005-14. The third 10-year inspections of the 900 MWe series began in 2009 and run to 2020. The 3rd ten-year inspections of the 1300 MWe series run from 2015 to 2024.

Ok I was wrong here, France apparently is currently only constructing **1** [sauce](https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/UnderConstructionReactorsByCountry.aspx)

And the weekly reports obviously don't make it into newspapers, but they shouldn't be surprising after 2016:

&gt; In 2016, following a discovery at Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant, about 400 large steel forgings manufactured by Le Creusot Forge since 1965 have been found to have carbon-content irregularities that weakened the steel. A widespread programme of reactor checks was started involving a progressive programme of reactor shutdowns, likely to continue over the winter high electricity demand period into 2017. This caused power price increases in Europe as France increased electricity imports, especially from Germany, to augment supply. As of late October 2016, 20 of France's 58 reactors are offline. These steel quality concerns may prevent the regulator giving the life extensions from 40 to 50 years, that had been assumed by energy planners, for many reactors. In December 2016 the Wall Street Journal characterised the problem as a ""decades long coverup of manufacturing problems"", with Areva executives acknowledging that Le Creusot had been falsifying documents.

4653,"Saying it again, since i hate the whole lul its simply xenophobia (not that it isnt part of the problem, but here is a far far worse one):

Because all the (even the left ones) opposition parties cleared them. Strache and Gudenus vanished behind the curtains, and shitting on Kurz was more important to the opposition, especially the SPÖ (socialist party) than taking the opportunity of the the decade and razing the FPÖ to the ground, as the ÖVP stood to end up winning votes from the desaster (as disillusioned FPÖ voters would be more likely to migrate to the ÖVP than anyone else). So the least they wanted to to is stick shit on Kurz and take down his government, to deny as much advantage as they could before the snap election they are all terribly unprepared for (especially the SPÖ with rendi wagner is in a horrid spot and tumbles form one internal crisis to the other). So here was the problem. The opposition together of course doesnt have enough votes to take down the government. Unless the FPÖ votes with them.

They virtually allowed the FPÖ to descend under the radar. They almost vanished even in the eyes of the media as guilty party. Reading up, or listening to the politcians, youd have gotten the impression the entirety of the guilty parties were Strache, Gudenus, and ... Kurz. Kurz getting named more as the guilty one than anyone else, once Strache and Gudenus vanished. I havent mentioned Kickl yet, who certainly knew about it. He certainly was tarnished enough (at the very least nobody trusted him to lead an impartial investigation) that Kurz forced him to step down as minister for the interior. And that disgusting bragain bin Göbbles wasnt just smuggled back into the parliament by his parties, no, he also voted side by side with the opposition against the government he used to be part of.

So why wouldnt the FPÖ voters keep voting FPÖ? Even the opposition, that spent the last one and a half year gnashing their teeth and declaring the FPÖ should never, ever be in a government not only never accused the FPÖ as a party with a single word, no, they even voted with them and clearly stated that the last guilty party still around was Kurz. A clear message. If anything, the FPÖ did the right thing and immediately removed Strache and Gudenus (never mind that they are still around, out of spotlight), at least thats what your FPÖ voter could read out of the actions of the other parties.

It was so bad the the chief editors of austrian newspaper together asked the politicians to remember what the scandal was actually about. The opposition parties gave no fucks. The blame is with them. There was the biggest chance to hit at the austrian right wing since the ""Part-of-the-Game"" and Hypo Alpe Adria scandals. Gone, for nothing but the lowest, pettiest power grubbing from the same parties that pretended to be so zealously anti FPÖ.

4660,"&gt;""La Mañana"" on TVE, last Monday. A dude said that about Catalan education. It's a disgusting lie that we can hear from Spanish nationalist segments. It's unacceptable for the Spanish public broadcaster to spread this kind of messages.

 ""La Mañana"" does not represent TVE's opinion, it's a debate among journalists from different mediums, some more to the left, quite a few usually too conservative on the right. You could use the same for TV3's programs like  *Tot es mou* or the daily 324 debates? 

 

&gt;It had 0 veracity. ABC and other Spanish nationalist media have already ruled them guilty, ignoring the presumption of innocence, while inventing things that are completely false. Let's be honest, the detainees didn't have any bomb. It's simply a lie. And to affirm that they are terrorists is also a lie.

Eh, I don't think you quite understand the definition of veracity. This is some basic constitutional rights, explained when you study the section 20.1.c) of the Constitution. It's only required that the information had some subjective veracity, in other words, that the information was contrasted enough by the journalist. At the time of their detention, it was an operation by the Audiencia Nacional (that investigates cases of terrorism) and the Civil Guard published a videos of facilities that could have been used to produce explosives. 

&gt;Let's be honest

No, you are not being honest here. The first video showed material that could be used to fabricate explosives. All filtration said that they had the materials and realized tests. The press communication from the Prosecutor said that they are accused of having explosives. You are not being honest here if you are denying this.

&gt;And to affirm that they are terrorists is also a 

Again, aren't you going too far here? The investigation just started but you are already championing that they are innocent and anything else is being dishonest and a populist. Buddy, your true colors are showing again. 

&gt;That's why I criticize what some major Spanish has been doing. It's clear there's some political interest here.

Eh, everyone is using this to further their political agenda. We have new general elections in less than two months, and we will inevitably have some new Catalan elections after that.

It won't happen whether there are US tanks in the way or not because Russia won't risk war with NATO, that would be suicide.

Lars-Gunnar Wigemark, the ex-chief of the EU delegation to B&amp;H, finished his unsuccessful mandate recently. ""When one looks at everything that's been found in his residence, one could assume that his mandate ended in a very bizarre twist."", claims Slobodan Vasković, a local journalist, stating that two dead cats were found.

What the cats were doing in the freezer, as well as what Wigemark was doing with them, are chill-inducing questions which also lead to a plethora of answers, most of them monstrous.

Vasković further claims that the dead, frozen cats were found during the cleaning of Wigemark's residence, after his departure, and that the EU delegation was informed of this find. The EU delegation promptly attempted to sweep this under the rug.

Allegedly, the cleaners of the residence were ordered to keep quiet about the whole ordeal.

""Was Wigemark torturing the poor animals before he froze them, or was he doing something worse, we can only guess. The fact of the matter is that the Swedish authorities should be having a good look into their diplomat's habits."", wrote Vasković.

5026,"&gt; As you see from the quote above from the other Redditor - this hasn't failed in achieving the impression, for some people, that political VIPs have much more freedom to roam unattended than some of their foreign counterparts - because we're the Netherlands, and we're so free and liberated. And just normal.

We can't conclude from seeing someone writing a comment that there's no security, there's a deliberate PR strategy to make ppl think that.

And yeah, politicians and royals are quite a bit more free in the Netherlands. Theres a few examples people are sharing in this post showing that. I witness myself everyday how Dutch politicans walk around freely. Security does do a great job hiding. I've had security in India and Brazil that was not very skilled in blending in to say the least... And a construction worker friend who was working on a shop's gevel was interrupted by the King himself asking how he was doing and what he had on his mind. He was most struck by the casuallness of the interaction, but in this case there was visible security.

&gt; There is, of course, a difference. And this clip in particular isn't about security detail but about behaviour. :)

I guess we agree after all!

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_(book)

The book is called ""propaganda"", but its author is known as ""the father of public relations"".

Much appreciate the tip thx. I know the book, never read it. My first PR agency made it their business to for 80% hire non-PR people but subject experts, and get help from a few supporting PR pro's. So that's my sorry excuse for not having read the book.....

There were a few moments this discussion I agreed with your original claim and then changed my mind back again :) But I gained insight in how we can look at this from another angle and see how some ppl make outreagous claims around this content. One of our own even :) RIP

&gt; It's hard to tell from the state of the world today if technology and interconnection has made us more skeptical or more gullible and indoctrinated. I tend toward the latter view, unfortunately.

You are not wrong. I was a blind believer in new media bringing more facts and enabling people to have better informed discussions. While it has delivered on that, unintended side effect was making it a tool for spreading lies and to mobilize literally any group of crazies (IS, flat earthers, nazi's, to name a few)

I'm hopefull though. From my own experience and from polls I see a majority of young people be concerned and sceptical about important issues impacting our world, while it's the older people getting fooled by fake news and using their voteright based on said news. 

While I wish all the older people happiness and healthy, long lives, I can't help but think in a few decades we live in a better governed world.",,/r/europe/comments/d9g6cy/the_dutch_way/f1kroq4/,Willem_van_Oranje,1569539443

On the other hand, open borders won't solve the problem as there are simply too many poor people. It doesn't solve root cause unless the plan is to let enough in to depopulate a country (e.g. Croatia, Bulgaria in EU).

Literally from your own source about Badia, translated to English: *""Even so, it cannot be labeled as a fascist because there is no documentary evidence.

Another historian shares his reflection, Agustí Colomines, and adds that ""part of the public opinion endorsed his harshness against the FAI, an organization deemed as terrorist*. 

What you are doing here, bringing 1930's movements to present makes no sense. The 1930's in Spain were agitated times, and FAI's anarcho-syndicalism violence existed. The Badia were in charge of public order in Catalonia in the Catalan government, and they were tough when repressing the violence of the FAI. But they never killed any of them, nor kidnapped them (your links don't say any of this).

No, that's just insulting someone. Since you're talking about the dictionnary's definition you may want to check it.

&gt; Where am I excluding myself from France's history?

Because you don't seem to care about France or you wouldn't insult one its presidents the way you did.

&gt; Well that's on you. ""Piece of shit"" doesn't mean he is the worst, you are once again just rewriting the dictionary for your convenient garbage argument to make any sort of sense.

No it doesn't, that's just my opinion on the matter. Like I said ""I"" wouldn't call a president that way unless he was the worst, it's obvious I don't have a very high standard considering the president's position like you do.

&gt; Who gives a shit if he wasn't the worst? Are we just measuring against the worst now? What kind of shitty standards are you setting for someone who represents our country?

Measuring against the worst president in French's history is already a pretty good standard IMO but hey, just my opinion. Again you seem to want to throw shit at the presidents of France.

&gt; Just because a person does 2 good things, it doesn't mean that the 1 bad thing they did is forgotten or forgiven. And he did more than 1 bad thing.

Uhh, okay.

&gt; Your imaginary karmic balance only concerns you, don't expect people to just adopt your very low standards. Just because he croaked doesn't mean he automatically gets respect.

Only you is imagining any kind of karmic balance here. When I talked of weighting it all, it was just as an indicative measurement.

&gt; Oh so because he was corrupt for a very long time without getting pinched then he is beyond justice? How convenient.

It sucks yes, but he had a stroke in 2005 and his health was already pretty bad.

&gt; I am talking about absolution because you literally wrote, and I quote, ""If a lot of our presidents were POS, maybe the problem is the people electing them don't you think?"". The problem can be in two places at once, and just because people vote for a corrupt POS doesn't mean that the corrupt POS doesn't get any blame.

I didn't mean to redirect all roots of the problems to the voters, only you is seeing this here. Chirac certainly wasn't absolved from his possible abuses of his functions if you have read any of his obituaries.

Like a general vehicle (Which i believe is the one in the photo), Which has most general gear.  
Ladder engine, which is basically a 30 meter ladder on the back of a truck.  
Or the life/scaffold engine, which is like a 30 meter high hydraulic platform  
Or a assistance vehicle, which carries 2 fire fighters and a ton of materials to be used in rescue operations (Like hydraulic lifts, jaws of life that can cut open a truck, cushions that can lift over 50 tonnes)  
Water rescue, carries a couple divers and assisting crew  
Container carriers (Which can carry containers ranging from hazmat containers, generators, emergency buildings, lights, extinguishing foam, 3 km of hoses and so on)

The sanctions are not supported by european socialists. Indeed, they also call the sanctions imposed by Latin American countries, Canada and the U.S to be lifted.

https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/d8434w/catalan_separatists_held_for_planning_violent/f18f50n/

&gt;That's a place that's used to store pyrotechnic material for popular festivities. The place of an actual person of the festivities comission (one of the detained). Our people do a lot of spectacles with fire at a local level (correfocs). There was actually trouble with an EU directive a few years ago because of this.

https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/d8434w/catalan_separatists_held_for_planning_violent/

Just to give some examples.

Also, let's remind /r/europe that [Quim Torra, separatist leader and President of Catalonia, told this group, the CDR, to push](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Torra-CDR-Apretad-haceis-apretar_0_820318075.html).

And let's not forget that Quim Torra, separatist leader and President of Catalonia, [claims that the Badia Brothers are ""one of the best examples"" of Catalan separatism](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180521/443741229358/hermanos-badia-torra-independentismo.html).

For those who don't know, [the Badia brothers were the leaders of a fascist, paramilitary group that, among other things, paraded Barcelona wearing brown shirts in the 30s and kidnapped people](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20180617/hermanos-badia-dos-caras-6877532).

And lastly, President Quim Torra thinks that the best way for Catalonia to achieve its independence is [through the Slovenian way](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/catalan-leader-under-fire-for-invoking-slovenia-s-road-to-freedom-1.3726640).

Well... not exactly. The Nazis promoted [Positive Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Christianity), entwining German identity with Christian ideology and ideas of racial purity. Nazism essentially repurposed Christianity into a kind of overtly anti-semitic Aryan mythos, for political purposes - distorting or denouncing the bits that didn't fit their views. On paper, they supported secularism and freedom of religion; in practise this was not the case.

At no point was I talking about ""compensation payments"", and that's why the taxation issue I have brought up has nothing to with expropriations.

Of course there is. They can become a KdÖR and that is a special tax status. And it is status the state can grant based on a relic of laws from the WRV.

Right, so communism didn't genocide people because of their ethnicity, they just keep the genocides that were already happening going. Such a great defense of communism right there. The Circassians were just one example anyways, this kind of shit happened all over the Soviet Union. The Soviets were horrible racist and violent towards minorities they didn't like, just like Hitler. It's just that the minorities changed over time based on who the state decided was the enemy at the moment, whereas for Hitler it was always the Jews and (to a lesser degree) Slavs.

&gt;If the whites had won the civil war, they would probably have done much worse atrocities.

And globalization is actually one of the main reasons causing this, because:

*  jobs are externalized
* huge companies have the advantage over smaller ones
* the power is gathered into fewer and fewer hands and transnational/global entities
* it encourages over-production ( because it's cheaper ) which leads to over consumption which leads to resources being wasted for no reason
* it also creates slave like conditions for some of the workers abroad, because there are way less regulations if any at all. It creates unfair competition, because one company produces its products in China, while another in EU, which has much stringent regulations and way higher costs

I honestly think globalization is really not the solution at this point, and that we need to become more and more self-sufficient, producing things locally ( at EU level ), hiring people locally and encouraging local companies rather than global ones.

* The judge made the [case secret](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20190924/golpe-policial-cdr-claves-detenidos-catalunya-guardia-civil-7648832), so it's not allowed to filter any news to the media. However, Spanish media has been publishing confidential information about the case and even official videos from the police!
* Today, the judge has already [dropped all charges related to rebellion and owning explosives](https://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/telenoticies/operacio-judes-la-fiscalia-mante-lacusacio-de-terrorisme-i-fa-caure-tinenca-dexplosius-i-rebellio/video/5924817/). Only charges of ""terrorism"" still stand up. So, to repeat it, according to the judge **there were no explosives** whatever El País is making up.
* Two of the detainees [couldn't speak to their lawyers yet](http://www.elpuntavui.cat/politica/article/17-politica/1670550-alerta-solidaria-denuncia-que-la-guardia-civil-impedeix-als-advocats-de-dos-dels-cdr-detinguts-el-23-s-poder-s-hi-comunicar.html). And according to some Spanish media, it would be those two the ones taht would have declared they were preparing sabotages some buildings.

Yes. The latter. People seek a community to be in - you can see it everywhere.

------

The Prosecutor's Office maintains the accusation of terrorism against the nine detainees last Monday, but has just withdrawn the accusations of possession of explosives and rebellion (as reported by the Catalan Audiovisual Media Corporation).

The representatives of the seven detainees who are in Madrid denounce that they have not yet been able to communicate with their clients, and that in addition, information that is the subject of the investigation is being leaked, from the summary secret. They have filed a complaint with the Bar Association and with the Civil Guard, because they believe that this way they try to pressure the defendants.

The prosecutor's statement said that these nine people belonged to a terrorist group that was organizing actions to attack between October 1 and the ruling against the referendum.

Since Judges for Democracy they have been alarmed by the Prosecutor's statement, considering that it has been written in more ""accusatory"" terms than those of the investigation phase. That it is full of adjectives and that in addition, it is strange that it has also been accused of rebellion when something like this has never happened with ETA.

The Civil Guard found no explosives in the records. What was found was material such as termite, often used for welding or for pyrotechnic material. At the time the specialists were waiting to pronounce on the matter, although today the accusation of possession of explosives has declined, the matter seems to be clear.

At the same time that it has been known that the Prosecutor's Office withdraws these charges, an Association of the Civil Guard (Spanish Civil Guard Association, AEGC) which is considered a popular accusation in the case of the CDR.

They say in their statement that they do not forget that ""these seven individuals were seeking to cause as much damage as possible, with advanced planning and preparation to act at very close dates, as can be seen from the information already available,"" referring to the statement. of the Prosecutor's Office issued on the day of the arrests.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/d9j9hx/the_prosecution_removes_the_accusation_for/f1hz0jo/,viktorbir,1569503296

A few people make a few billion and suddenly the 1% seems to have a disproportionate share of the wealth.  But in reality it's not the 1% - it's the 0.001%.

it's the fifty zuckerbergs who are building two hundred billion dollar companies.

5703,"I don't think you know what the word scientific means. We postulate language families on the basis of systematic sound correspondence between suspected cognates from basic vocabulary. Perhaps the factoid that we now know **almost all languages in Europe are related this way** is new to you.

Anyways let's have a look at some of the correspondences:

|English|Gothic|German|Swedish|Proto-Germanic|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|I|ik|ich|**jag****^(1)**|\*ek(a)|
|father|fadar|Vater|far|\*fader|
|tongue|tuggo|Tung|tunga|\*tungon|
|heart|hairto|Herz|**hjarta****^(1)**|\*herton|
|earth|??? (unattested)|Erd|**jord****^(1)**|\*ertho|

^(1) These forms show us swedish underwent a sound change whereby /e/ is diphtongized to /ja/ (and /jo/). In fact, 'jord' pairs up exactly with German, which didnt have this development and thus retains the /e/ in 'Erd'. More importantly, it's consistent: Every proto-germanic root that has /e/ is expected to have /ja/ or /jo/ in Swedish. **That is how we know these are truly related words and not loans.**

Now let's look at some basic vocabulary between ""American"" languages Mohawk (Iroquois) versus Najavo (Athabaskan) and English.

|Mohawk|Navajo|English|
|:-|:-|:-|
|ohsakara|azee|mouth|
|karahkwa|shá |sun|
|kanonhsa|kin|house|
|ehnita|oljee|moon|

Clearly, the correspondences are not here. We can probably safely say that these languages aren't related. That is why it doesn't make any sense to group them together. Of course this is a massively simplified example and the reality of the field is much more complex. In any case, it is absolutely undisputable that English Swedish and Gothic spring from the same source: Germanic.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/d996e0/when_you_donate_blood_in_sweden_you_get_a_text/f1h8uik/,Badstaring,1569488179

Considering how far removed the citizens are from law creation, this is simply untrue.

5784,"&gt; Hence my suggestion of entirely removing the legal idea of ""marriage"" instead letting any partnerships default back to a ""civil partnership"". Obviously every religion is then still free to perform their version of marriage with whatever rules and exclusions they please, since those then have no effect on the legal rights of those participating.

The issue with this is that ""civil partnership"" doesn't translate very well when you cross the border. The concept of marriage is universally known an understood and even in countries that don't allow same-sex marriage, if a same-sex couple from abroad says that they're married, people will understand what it means.

Civil partnerships are a much newer concept and the exact definition of it is different in various countries. In some countries it's identical to marriage in everything but name. In other countries there may be certain rights that come with marriage that don't come with a civil union. And there are countries that simply have no notion of civil partnerships.

When you're abroad with your spouse and you end up in a hospital unable to make medical decisions, you want your spouse to be able to just say that the two of you are married and thereby unambiguously establishing your spouse as your medical proxy instead of trying to explain what your civil partnership entails and that it's really the equivalent of a marriage to someone who has never heard of the concept.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/d92sex/agreement_that_gaylesbian_or_bisexual_people/f1had3b/,Rannasha,1569489121

5821,"No, that's still not socialism.

Socialism is when the workers own the means of production. Most socialists want essential services to be government-run, while most other things should be run by worker's councils, or as cooperatives. Cooperatives already exist in capitalist society, but socialists want to replace all companies with employee-owned cooperatives.

Other socialists believe that the best way to achieve socialism is to abolish the government wholly or in part, such that all power structures become flat rather than stratified. These are called anarchists. 

Communists, on the other hand, tend to want far more state control, and believe that the only way the workers can truly own the means of production is by having the government control production, and having the workers control the government. 

Socialism, ultimately, wants *all* of the people to control the means of production, whereas capitalists are fine with only rich people controlling the means of production. 

Venezuela is explicitly not socialist because they still have privately owned corporations, where people work in wage labor.

However, socialists are nothing if not good at infighting, and there are dozens of socialist ideologies with both subtle and not-so-subtle differences.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/d93ygc/income_inequality_in_western_europe_compared_to/f1gyr7c/,wasmic,1569481418

Motherhood isn't supposed to be for the grandchildren but I ll give you that.


&gt; Maybe the reason why there are so many maladjusted young adults is because all of us were dropped off at daycare

Per comparison with countries in which children aren't ""dropped off"", I don't think Europeans are ""maladjusted"". 

&gt;  culture brainwash

Culture is always brainwashed. 


&gt; Africa isn't going anywhere, but what about Europe? Are you ok with Europeans going extinct?

You were talking about humans as a species going extinct because of a lack of birth, I showed you it isn't possible any time soon.

I can do the same with ""white Europeans"" with some maths. (Considering what you re saying, I guess telling you the foreign born European birth rate won't help)

Based on the current birth rate of 1.4, we lose about 1/3 of the youth each generation. (In the EU)  

Based on that drop rate, if we assume a generation lasts ~30 years, you ve got a 50% drop 60 years from now, assuming nothing changes.

From the ""European white pop"" that we can estimate at around 400k. About 50%-60% can still give birth. 

Meaning that with the birth rate being unaffected, it will take 120 years before the European pop in age of giving birth gets under the 50 million bar. (UK pop). 


Now this figures are heavily biased and will likely not be true. 
First of all, ""white Europeans"" and ""non white"" can and will mix and it will likely drive the birth rate up.

Secondly, genetically speaking a lot of the ""non white Europeans"" are very close to ""white Europeans genetically and can be considered as the same ""race"" scientifically, despite the phenotype difference.

This is the case for northern africans, middle Eastern and Indians. 
So you don't really have to worry for the loss of diversity.

Thirdly, based on European law, it's not exactly easy to measure the white pop of Europe, meaning that my figures are skewed",France,/r/europe/comments/d8qawx/europes_ageing_population/f1h0hpx/,Plyad1,1569482579
