5,"I think these differences persist because some parts of land is just better than others. No matter how much money you throw at it, bad geography is still bad geography.

But these counties transfer Money because rural us is still us. This means the rich Americans want to support poor Americans bc of in group bias or social cohesion or however you want to explain it.

The eu should have created the same kind of homogeneity before even trying to introduce the euro. I mean the eu doesn’t even have a free dictionary, for all eu citizens, so we can communicate between ourselves properly. They should have made the Erasmus obligatory for every eu citizen back when it started, because when you have friends all over Europe, it’s much harder to just say “this and this country are just lazy and awful”. I also think the eu should stop funneling the money through the nation states, and instead invest directly so the citizens know the money comes from the eu. They should have built infrastructure to allow for easier travel. And when they had earned goodwill through these measures, they should have slowly expanded the federalization, and inevitable homogenization, without a giant backlash. They didn’t. The euro was in my opinion, introduced 50 years prematurely.

Now, after an awful bad impression for a common currency, I think the fiscal transfers aren’t going to happen. The eu might hold on for a while, but eventually the downsides will be too big for Italy to accept, they will leave, and destroy the eu.",,/r/europe/comments/fz7tv3/making_europes_economy_work_better_time_to/fn67i5c/,kirtimu,1586690464

111,"It was less communist than USSR. But unfortunatly it didnt help its economy. Yugoslavia bankrupted first in early 60s, that is when communists decided that we should open to the west. 

So we got some cheap loans and we made worker agreements with the west. 20% of yugosalv workers worked in western countries and they were earning foreign currency which yugoslavia desperatly needed . Beacuse yugoslav dinar was worthless in international bussines community. 

So we got cheap loans and we send workers to the west to work in factories and mines. That is considered the golden age of Yugoslavia 65-82. 

But then our debt became huge and interests became huge and in 82 we bankrupted. We could not pay our loans any more. 

Now because of strategic position the west didnt want to push Yugoslavia beacuse of fear that soviets might make a base in mediteran sea. 

So they signed off a couple of billions and they restructered the rest of the loans. But socialist economy is not as strong as capitalism and therefore it couldnt survice without massive loans from the west. 

So after 82 things got wild. Yugoslavia was not able to buy oil or electricy abroad, se we had electricity only everey other day during day. You could drive car only every other day. One of the things the communists did was that loaf of bread was not 1 kg anymore but 800 grams. So that people would still get a loaf of bread but it was 20% less of flour which was another thing that was scarce. 

And then morons from army decided amidst financial crisis that we need new war planes and new tanks. So we threw a bunch of money in developing upgrades for the russian t 72 and bought a bunch of mig 29. 

And then in 85 inflation hit and then we ran out of money, worker strikes appeared and the rest is history.",,/r/europe/comments/fzqae7/rainy_evening_in_ljubljana_slovenia_1960s/fn614nc/,Tomaz120,1586683344

215,"This is one of the worst articles about the Swedish approach out there. 

&gt; life in Sweden is carrying on, mostly as usual. 

This isn't true. 40% of people in Stockholm are working from home, universities and high schools have been closed, lots of sectors are facing labor shortages because everyone is calling in sick when they have a slight cough (per the recommendation of the health authorities), most clubs have been closed because of the ban on bar serving and the ban on larger gatherings, elderly are self-isolating, all of my events have been cancelled even if they are lower than 50 people, you can't visit elderly care facilities. 

It isn't as extreme as in Spain, Italy, or the UK but those actions aren't yet necessary yet because there isn't an exponential increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care or a rapid increase in deaths. 

&gt;At the end of March, 2,300 doctors, scientists and academics signed an open letter to the government calling for stricter measures. 

The vast majority of those who signed that were outside of epidemiology and include  Master Students studying computer science and engineering.

&gt;   She notes that, based on the modeling she’s seen, the healthcare system in Sweden will collapse if stricter measures are not adopted immediately.  

[This was her modeling, which she released two weeks ago, which said that today we would require 5 times as many intensive care beds as we actually do.](https://twitter.com/KimVesto/status/1248513414504288257) 

&gt; Sweden has a relatively high case fatality rate: as of April 8, 7.68% of the Swedes who have tested positive for COVID-19 have died of the virus. Neighboring countries, like Norway and Denmark, have case fatality rates of 1.46% and 3.85% respectively. (The U.S. case fatality rate is 3.21%.) While Sweden’s elevated case fatality rate could be a result of its low testing rates compared to its neighbors, **experts** say Sweden’s laissez-faire approach could also be to blame. 

Which experts??? Anyone worth their weight knows that the statistics on CFR right now are so dependent on the amount of testing that you do that you shouldn't draw any conclusions from them.

265,"'Infect the young and isolate those at risk' - One German scientist's plan to end the lockdown
Prof Alexander Kekulé says the lockdown is in danger of going on too long and causing more damage than the virus.

A leading German epidemiologist who predicted the coronavirus crisis in Europe is now calling for governments to end the lockdown.

Prof Alexander Kekulé warned the virus was about to engulf Europe and publicly urged Angela Merkel’s government to start screening international travellers as early as January.

But he now believes the lockdown is in danger of going on too long and causing more damage than the virus, and has drawn up a plan for how it can be safely lifted.

“It’s impossible to wait for a vaccine,” Prof Kekulé told The Telegraph. “The quickest we could have a vaccine ready is in six months. Based on experience, I’d say the reality is closer to a year. We can’t stay under lockdown for six months to a year. If we did that our society and our culture would be ruined.”

Prof Kekulé, the head of microbiology at Halle University, has been the Cassandra of Germany’s coronavirus crisis. As early as January 22, he called for travellers to be tested for the virus at airports and borders. He appeared on national television, but his warnings fell on deaf ears. Now the world is in the grip of a widespread pandemic:

“If we had started testing and following the chains of infection in January, we could have contained the epidemic here without resorting to a lockdown,” he says. “If you can get to people by the time they’ve infected 20 people you can stop it. But by the time it’s 400, there’s no chance.”

By March, when the virus had Germany in its grip, he was calling for the border to be closed and schools to shut down. 

“At that stage a lockdown was the only option to slow the spread and prevent hospitals being overwhelmed,” he says. “But now we have to consider the possibility that a long lockdown may end up doing more harm than the virus.” 

Angela Merkel has dampened hopes of restrictions ending any time soon, telling Germans this week: “We must not be reckless now. We could very quickly destroy what we have achieved.”

Not for the first time in this crisis, Prof Kekulé finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from Mrs Merkel. When he urged her government to do more about the virus in January, she chose to wait and see. Now he says the lockdown can be safely lifted by following a simple three-point plan. 

First, he says, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions who are most vulnerable to the virus must remain in isolation.

“We have to persuade them to stay at home, and that means we have to find ways of making it bearable for them, such as apps that will allow them to order their shopping or continue their social life,” he says.

“If they are determined to go out, fine — but they have to wear full FFP medical standard masks.”

That brings us to the second point in Prof Kekulé’s plan: a move from social distancing to what he calls “smart distancing”.

“We need to adapt distancing to the situation. A cashier at a supermarket check-out, for instance, is going to be exposed to infection all day. He needs to wear a mask, he needs proper hygiene measures. A taxi driver needs to learn not to touch his face after handling money.”

Basically, we all need to get used to wearing facemasks, Prof Kekulé says. “If you look at Hong Kong, they managed to avoid a major outbreak there and they’re very close to Guangdong in mainland China, which was badly affected. One of the key differences was they started wearing facemasks early in Hong Kong.”

An ordinary surgical mask is sufficient for those who are not especially vulnerable, he says, and there’s no need to wear one while going for a walk. “In an open air setting a mask isn’t that effective. But in any indoors setting when others are there, we should all be wearing them.”

He’s even come up with a slogan to convince people, “Kein Held ohne Maske”, and an English version: “Be a masked superhero”.

Thirdly, and most controversially, Prof Kekulé says we have to let the young get the virus.

“People under 50 are very, very unlikely to die or get seriously ill from the coronavirus,” he says. “We have to let them get infected so they can develop immunity.”

Essentially, this is a return to the herd immunity plan once backed by the UK and widely seen as discredited. But Prof Kekulé argues that once the outbreak is under control and hospitals are not overwhelmed, there is a place for it.

Children are least at risk so the lockdown should be lifted at schools and kindergartens first, he says — a plan already adopted by Denmark, which plans to reopen schools after Easter.

Germany has won plaudits for testing more than other European countries, carrying out around 100,000 tests a day, but Prof Kekulé says that's not enough. He says it needs to be raised to 500,000.

He concedes that some younger people do get seriously ill and die from the coronavirus. “What happens in these cases is their immune system overreacts and starts attacking their own body,” he says.

“But this only happens with a very small number of people. I know it sounds heartless but we may have to live with these deaths.

“Herd immunity is our only option now. We cannot wait for a vaccine. We have to find a way to live with this virus.”",,/r/europe/comments/fzsf53/infect_the_young_and_isolate_those_at_risk_one/fn5vaan/,DamoclesBDA,1586677127

The sister of my grandmother used to tell me that the first day of school the teacher told the students that they only shall speak Italian, also at home with their parents and relatives. Basically every person in the past spoke a dialect and also Italian (taught at school). But the difference in language was not only beetween north and south, but beetween every region and also beetween different province in the region it selfs. So maybe two person from Lombardy spoke the same dialect but with slightly differences because the came from two dirrerent city.

Today, there are still person who speak a dialect (and Italian too, of course). I think that the big difference in the past remain today with the differences in the accent. You can easily tell if someone is from Lombardy or from Veneto (two regions in the north) and also if someone is from Milan or from Bergamo (two cities in Lombardy) just by the accent.

It means that the entire Eurozone borrows money as one entity, so countries with a higher debt to GDP ratio will get lower interest rates and countries with a lower debt to GDP ratio will get higher interest rates.

392,"The thing is that the EU cohesion funds are pittance compared to what you have been paying to Eastern Germany, even though thanks to the EU, you have the same market access as you have inside your own country.

I am not saying I feel like we are entitled to get more, you however are hardly entitled to expect gratitude. You have profitted massively here, both from the investments you made here and also from the labour force that you keep getting from Eastern and Southern Europe.

As I said, the cohesion/convergence doesn't even work now, with the current size of the cohesion funds, without it, the EU would probably become completely unsustainable in the long term, so what you are paying is really the bare mininum.

As for the refugees - maybe you wouldn't have to absorb so many of them, if a big part of your political class and population weren't virtual-signaling to anyone who'd listen that you are ready and open to refugees exactly in the time period when the refugee crisis was on its peak.

I know Germans probably think they are helping Southern Europe a lot this way and I admit that by the time the refugees were marching through the Balkans, it was too late to do anything else, but in the bigger picture, your country basically works as a gigantic pull factor and in this sense you are only make the lives of Southern Europeans more complicated.

629,"&gt;If yes, are Northern Albanians more likely to have a Nordic appearance than Southern Albanians?

1. No, they are more likely to show Dinaric type rather than Nordic. Actually Nordic is the least more common type in the North compared to other types. The difference in % of light eyes/blonde hair of North and South isn't worth stating at all. Let's not confuse other people who are not from Albania.
2. Dinarics are not a small minority. Albanians ancestry is in the mountains, both North and South. There is no divide. The head shape is very common in the south too! It's way too small of a population and land size to have big differences.
3. This is data since 1960, meaning just modern history. It doesn't show the big picture of people intermixing with each other. From 1960s until today very little has changed in terms of appearance because we were isolated from outside influence. Furthermore, my original argument **which you completely missed** was that those who came from rural areas mixed with those in bigger cities which also in turn encountered more internationals. This is why I'm saying it's a rural/urban difference rather than North/South. Not hard to understand.

&gt;There are Spaniards, Italians, Hellenes and other Balkaners that also have a Nordic appearance. 

So do you agree that you're wrong calling it Nordic appearance? I mean, if it's in every country out there, how can it be Nordic? Even Asians have it.",,/r/europe/comments/fz575x/thethalbaniaphoto_by_hildegunn_taipale/fn4sasu/,Irrignitr,1586647880

Some humans simply don't believe it until it's affecting them personally. I think every culture has a saying similar to ""Out of sight, out of mind"". I see the same thing where I am; after a month inside I've only stepped out 3 times for groceries, and each time I went to the supermarket I saw people in line holding just 2 or 3 items, which I should say are not essential, and were obviously just an excuse to get out of the house.

Yesterday I talked to a friend who is still working (she works at a bank) and she was telling me how stressful it is to be there and see people go up to the teller for stupid things that could be done either on line or through an ATM. Or people making massive cash withdrawals so they won't need to make several each day on the ATM - the thing is, they could be paying everything with a card, but... no, money it is, which goes back and forth in people's hands and makes it much likelier that you get infected.

In the Šumadija regions – Kačer, Gruža, Lepenica, Kragujevačka Jasenica, Smederevsko Podunavlje and Jasenica, Kosmaj and in the villages around Belgrade, 8,894 kin families with 52,475 households were included in the study of J. Cvijić. Of these, only 464 families with 3,603 houses were ""old"" (starinci, also called ""natives""), which is close to the number of families of unknown descent (470 families with 2,464 houses), with the rest of the population being settlers (7,960 families, 46,408 houses). Šumadija was settled from almost all of the regions of the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia, though most of which came from the Dinaric areas, that is, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, from Raška and Sandžak, Dalmatia, Lika, and the rest of the Dinaric areas. In lesser numbers they hailed from Kosovo, from Metohija, and the rest of the Yugoslav regions.[14]

946,"To answer your comment above as well as this one:

&gt; So what's the downside of issuing common debt for The Netherlands

Essentially it reduces the pain one country will feel, by spreading it out over all EU countries. Downside is that the co-signing countries with low debt (Such as Netherlands, Germany and Finland) will lose their current ability to get cheap loans and have to take out more expensive loans. Effectively costing these countries money, but saving the one country money on the interest rate of their loans.

The problem these low-debt countries have is that there isn't a timeframe on Eurobonds, and the money from Eurobonds can be spend without conditions. Therefor creating a liability for unlimited time, which is a gigantic risk for these countries. Another problem is that these Eurobonds can violate the constitutions of these countries, i.e. it can be interpreted as taxation without representation, because money from taxpayers is used as a guarantee for the loans given to another country without any say in what they do with the money.


&gt; Because the position of the German and Dutch governments is that they see no way of accepting any format for them. That's shutting down the conversation at the beginning.

It doesn't matter what the conversation would result in, when there is absolutely no support in the electorate of these countries for any form of shared debt. As that is perceived as a gigantic liability, one that they will not accept. Any conversation would be a waste of time, and time is of the essence in this current crisis. 

I think a very important point in the discussion of ESM vs Eurobonds is that even if you put the ESM conditions on Eurobonds, the liability is still extremely high for the northern countries, resulting in no support among the electorate. Not to mention that the southern European countries seem to want no conditions period. Thus it seems the ESM is the only solution available currently, but one that isn't desired by southern europe. I think a much better point to discuss would be loosening the conditions of the ESM, and reach a compromise in which all countries feel comfortable.  

Please try to remember that, very harshly worded, the north (at least the majority of the populace) wants to help but are in no way obliged to, but it is in their self interest as well.  And it seems that they want some form of control over how the money will be spend, which seems fair to me. It shouldn't be that hard to justify using the money, as everyone can see it is desperately needed. 

Instead of demanding Eurobonds without any chance of getting them, i wish everyone would put their effort into reaching a compromise on the conditions of the ESM. I think this will eventually be agreed upon, as it is the only solution the north seems comfortable with, but the question will be if this will be accepted by the southern countries' parliaments. Atleast, personally i hope the conditions of the ESM for this corona crisis will be a lot less restricting but that there will be oversight.",,/r/europe/comments/fz7cyc/what_do_you_think_of_coronabonds/fn3r174/,Roelios,1586626241

1042,"&gt; Yes when you take loan it creates more debt, that's how it works, and IMF loans are not special in any way. That's exactly how it works. 

The point is that you take loans because the Ukrainian economy is unable to function independently and as a result, the country lives on loans. If it were not for the events of 2014, then everything would be fine with the economy and loans would not be needed, so what comes as a blessing eventually drove the country into an endless circle from which it is impossible to get out and as a result, the IMF chooses the right moment for its own goals. Why recently the law was adopted making the central bank of Ukraine higher than the courts, higher than laws, if this is not a colonial system?  


&gt; The law is not about sale of land. The law is about the right of people who own land to sale their property. They own it - they can sale it. 

In a situation where the country has nothing left except its soil to sell it is a crime. This means losing the last hope for sovereignty. Ukrainian farmers will not be able to buy this land and go bankrupt. They are already on the brink of survival. This land will be acquired by international corporations, completely crowding out Ukrainian producers and destroying local businesses, forming a foreign agglomerate that will dictate its will to the state, [because the largest source of export from Ukraine is its agricultural culture.](https://open4business.com.ua/commodity-pattern-of-foreign-trade-of-ukraine-export-jan-apr-2019/) And this HUGE source of income will now fall into the hands of transnational corporations, finally turning the country into a colony. How can you not understand that? The land will be sold. But not to Ukrainians. As a result, Ukrainians will have nothing left but debts and even your government won't be able to change it coz transnational companies will own not only some debts but also your economy.   


Just look at the percentage of corn, weed, seeds, vegetables, beans and even meat with other food coz too grow cows you need the fucking land too: [https://oec.world/en/profile/country/ukr/](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/ukr/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Trade is growing, and Ukraine's industry is adapting to EU market, that's exactly how it is supposed to work.  

&amp;#x200B;

Itэы adapting at the cost of monstrous economic losses. My point was that **first you had to raise your production quality** to an acceptable level for the EU, **and only then** sign the trade agreement. This is very simple logic. And all that these Protestants achieved in 2014 is not the entry to the EU, but the destruction of their economy. They absolutely did not understand what was happening. They were promised accession to the EU, and as a result, it's the 6th year of ""adapting to the economy"" and only debts are accumulating, not income. Moreover, the EU introduced duties for Ukrainian goods, while it has full access to the Ukrainian market. Does this really seem like a normal, honest cooperation?  


&gt; There is no reason to keep trade or sign any agreement with Russia. In the long run Ukraine's strategy should not rely on any trade with Russia, because at any given moment this trade can be stopped/used for blackmailing. 

Man, [Russia is still the biggest business partner for Ukraine](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/ukr/). Just imagine what will happen to your economy if you will lose this market. Completely. Fuck, are you a patriot or what? Why do you want your country collapse so badly in any possible way? You should think about what is beneficial for your country, and not how to harm Russia in the first place.

&gt; Another lie. Criminal cases against former president has nothing to do with ""theft"".   One case was about sending sailors from one Ukrainian port to another. Another one was about appointment of judges which is exactly part of his job. 

There are 16 cases against himnow. **SIXTEEN**. Not 2 as you described :D It's you who is lying here, man. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the [Newslink](https://112.international/ukraine-top-news/nine-criminal-cases-against-ukraines-ex-president-poroshenko-would-he-go-into-slammer-42224.html) almost a year ago when it was only 11. Here is the quote:

&gt;  
 There are some cases concerning economic affairs. On May 22, Portnov announced the filing of a statement to the State registry office about Poroshenko’s money laundering and tax evasion for his PrJSC Kuznia na Rybalskomy enterprise. “Poroshenko has legalized $ 300 million in revenues through offshore companies, concluding a non-existent deal with funds stolen from the Ukrainian army,” Portnov explained in his Telegram channel. 

Just read this I think you'll find many interesting things about him.   


&gt; Also, losing elections is absolutely normal in democratic countries and there is nothing wrong about that. 

Yes, it's completely normal. I was referring to it coz he was a symbol of what happened in 2014 and ended his term with the fucking 8% of approval. You know it kinda tells a lot about what really happened then and what people think about it.

Can not in my opinion work without a fiscal union, and this is a repeat of a previous comment, but is still valid here.

So what would a fiscal union would mean.

Denmark as a country has 5 regions and 98 municipalities. The difference in income and the tax base is so big they agree/disagree on a complicated wealth exchange system where money goes to the poorer municipalities. https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/betaler-andre-en-del-af-regningen-dig-tjek-din-kommune-her plotting in a municipality you can see its average income, how much it receives/pay to or from other municipalities, What its taxation level would be without this money transfer, where the municipality is on the map, and how it compares to other municipalities. All in Danish of course.

That appears to be the system euro bonds and fiscal union advocates wants.

What they forget or ignore is the other component, that to ensure all municipalities follows this system there are checks, controls and finance audits of each municipality. If one overspends or run deficits it risks being put under state administration.

This happened to the municipaliti of Vesthimmerland. It had run a deficit for a full year and was placed under administration of the ministry of domestic affairs. First the municipality is asked to produce a plan for how it will get its financial situation under control. For instance close schools, halt projects, sell assets, increase taxes, reduce wages/employees, reduce services, restructure its debt..... If it can mot provide a plan or one that is deemed not good enough by the minister, the ministry of domestic affairs will make one for that municipality. https://www.tv2nord.dk/vesthimmerland/hard-kost-vaere-under-administration-der-er-ingen-kaere-mor

So fiscally deficit countries in the EU. This is what will be a key part of any fiscal union Denmark could ever be a part of. It will not accept wealth sharing without a system for administrative control.

Then there was a period of ""equality"" during the Roman Empire which put north and south on the same pace.
With the fall of the Empire, North and South divided again culturally (Empire Vs Pope) but where still more or less equally developed economically.

All of this went on till the unification on Italy when the north was starting to be industrialised while the south was still largely agricultural.

So when does that happen? Tomorrow? Would be great tomorrow. 35 billion is less than 5% of the German stimulus package from March.

Basically, people in home-quarantine are the most valuable target for pharmacological treatment, after that only oxygen seems to be good.

2) Isolating asymptomatic or low-symptomatic people: this will be very important for recovering a normal life and removing the lockdown.

1198,"A recurrent debate since the eurocrisis has been whether stability tools should share risk
among Member States or, instead, segregate risks within individual countries. As the
eurozone discusses — and postpones — genuine risk-sharing measures, such as European
deposit insurance, it’s important to look back at when risks were shared, and who actually
benefited.

**Risk sharing when needed**

The common narrative is that rescue programs have helped deeply troubled countries
avoid sovereign bankruptcy or widespread bank failures. But, by avoiding extreme
outcomes, these programs also protected the banks of the core countries — Germany and
France, in particular — that had accumulated huge exposures to the periphery before the
crisis. At the time, risk sharing (however unpleasant) was the best available option for the
governments of the core countries. It saved them from intervening (at the expense of their
taxpayers) to prop up their own national banking systems.
“Risk sharing,” since the crisis, has always been a “twin bailout.” One bailout to banks on
the periphery, which in turn offered another bailout to banks in the core. According to the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS), in 2010 the total exposure of French and
German financial institutions to Greece and its banks amounted to $120bn, more than ten
times that of Italian and Spanish banks. In May that year, Eurozone governments began
disbursing €52.9bn of bilateral loans to Greece; France’s share of this risk-sharing
measure only slightly exceeded Italy’s. And by mid 2011, French and (less abruptly)
German banks had reduced their own exposure to Greece and Greek banks by $35bn.",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/fz2z10/a_look_back_what_eurozone_risk_sharing_actually/fn2utbh/,notmyself02,1586604167

1200,"I'm no expert, so take this with a grain of salt but from what I've read &amp; learned: first off, according to polls in Der Spiegel from 1989, only 29% of East Germans wanted a reunification. 71% said that the ""DDR needed to be a sovereign state"" with internal changes ([Source, in German](https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13498034.html)). These polls were conducted on behalf of the ZDF and Spiegel with cooperation from West German institutes. The CDU, however, campaigned hard for reunification and send over hundreds of thousands of stickers and flags to East Germany to spread the idea ([Source, in German](http://www.runde-ecke-leipzig.de/sammlung/index.php?inv=17880)). This is of course not as important in the general reunification, but underlines some things I'm going to touch on. 

When actual reunification happened, it was done fast, which according to historians still has long-lasting impacts. About 2/3rds of the East German firms were privatized, largely with West German managers at the head, within two years. This process is described as ""chaotic"" and ""without an overarching plan"" leading to widespread closures and loss of employment as well as resentment and disappointment within the East German populace (which... does make sense if you look at the stat up above. Most of them didn't even want reunification, and now they have a bunch of West German executives coming in and making decisions without and input or proper communication). 

This process was done by the ""Treuhand"", which was originally actually decided on and created by the DDR to assess East German firms and if need be, deconstruct and privatize them. They were then made a part of the West German government and largely handled by West German managers which were in connection with a bunch of corruption scandals. It's not that surprising then that 80% of the DDR-Production wealth had been redistributed to West Germans by 1994, about 14% went to non-Germans, and 6% to former DDR citizens. 

Since the splitting up of major firms was a want for many of those managers and people in power, a lot of big firms were pulled apart without any real or proper assessments of whether it was needed. This lead to a disruption of supply chains and a loss of actual economic worth within those companies. 

Instead of a slower process involving long term investing and proper assessment of the East German companies, the West preferred a hard and fast shift into a market economy. 

East Germans were now left without employment, managed by West Germans with dubious decency and no real idea as to why or who this was supposed to be fixed. Die Treuhand is still seen as the ""ultimate form of savage, ""no-rules"" capitalism"" and lordship of the West.  

I highly recommend the book ""Die Treuhand: Idee - Praxis - Erfahrung 1990-1994"" by Markus Böick. He was also one researcher involved in the study ""Wahrnehmung und Bewertung der Arbeit der Treuhandanstalt"" (Perception and Judgement of the work of the Treuhandanstalt) which was created on behalf of the German Ministry of Energy and Economy, here's the [summary as a PDF](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/W/wahrnehmung-und-bewertung-der-arbeit-der-treuhandanstalt-kurz.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=10).

1215,"&gt;""because of ethnonationalism"" means that there us a causal link. That is what ""because of"" means. The apple fell from the tree because of gravity. Therefore, gravity caused the apple to fall from the tree.

You have misunderstood what I said, mostly because you don't seem to understand our history. We are a democratic state due to ethnonationalism not because ethnonationalism is fundamental to democracy, but because ethnonationalism led to the establishment of an independent state, which is the main reason we get to have democracy right now instead of foreign tyranny.

&gt;You said ""most countries in Europe"", but failed to name any, so I named some and demonstrated how your pattern doesn't hold up in the most obvious examples.

You picked the most obviously wrong answers... (and Poland)

&gt;You're free to provide any causal historical examples you think support your claim, but the back-pedaling I quoted above signals that you don't have any.

Why are you so overly confident in making such claims? It is evident that you lack understanding about some basic aspects of European history. A large bunch of European countries got their independence from three large empires in the first quarter of the 20th century, and half of Europe was liberated from Soviet-imposed socialist rule (or direct Soviet occupation) in the Revolutions of 1989 mainly due to ethnonationalism of the smaller nations within those empires.

&gt;It achieved independence because its domitor (Napoleonic France, Prussia, Russian Empire, Nazi Germany, Soviet Union, etc.) exhausted their resources fighting wars with other superpowers, similar to how America achieved its independence not through ethnonationalism but by way of the French-English conflict.

There are many reasons why such empires fell, ethnonationalism of the subjugated nations being one of them.

The entirety of Iceland outside the capital reigion has a population of 1.3/km^2 and is also painted the same colour because they are all less than 50/km^2.

I meant that southern Italy has been poorer than the North for at least 150 years, but it's mostly due to an absence of large industries and specialized workforce, which was much more prevalent in the North even before the unification. There are some notable exceptions that can be seen even in this map, like De Cecco in Abruzzo.

Furthermore, due to a severe lack of investments (or their mismanagement) this situation became chronic, hence the migration (that you correctly mentioned) towards northern Italy and the US, as well as Germany and France.

What it translates, looks more like a limitation on public spending in general when there are no funds for it.

Probably English is not your first language also, but ""German bank's debts"" sounds like ""debts German banks have"".

It was probably the other way around: Spanish entities got money from German banks and where not able to pay them back. In order to get ""new"" money, provisions where asked for having a chance of getting this money back.

You know, politics in general do not really focus on a very long timeline. Typically it's just to the next election. But since several years, there is a realization in Germany, that the country is getting older and older, with even less young people following.

Our pensions will get lower and lower, while the money requested from the working people raise and raise. I, for myself, expect to have to work till I'm 70 (the law currently requires 67). Then I expect my public pension to be around 30% of my current income. More or less a joke. But on the other hand, even today I pay more than 25% of my current income into the public pension fund.

1384,"Being old doesn't make someone an experienced conversationalist and being one matters only from a perspective of articulation. An inexperienced conversationalist may not be able to present their thoughts as coherently, but that doesn't make any opinions they expressed detrimental to the discussion. 

One can be very fluent from a young age. It's not about how much time you spent on this Earth, but rather how you spent it. Blanket segregation just doesn't make sense here even if experience in conversation mattered, which it doesn't.

And how are people in this system of yours even supposed to become experienced conversationalists when you're not letting them practice that skill on people who are experienced? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And if you're discussing topics that take years and even decades to fully appreciate, that's what you want. 

What kind of a topic takes decades to study and appreciate unless something new about it came to light during that time? Read about it from either an unbiased source (no such thing) of from more sources biased in different directions, maybe talk to people on both sides. If there is a historic side to it, you can read about that too and there you go - now you can form an opinion. With internet, all this can oftentimes be done in a few hours. If you later come across information that you didn't find in your original research, verify it and adjust your position accordingly. Notice how you don't need neither an ID nor age marks to do any of this?

Therefore, I don't see how I would want people I converse and debate with to be exclusively older than a certain age. Arguments should always speak for themselves.

1568,"Well, I am not a tax lawyer so I probably don't understand all the intricacies. From what I have read it is the problem that all the tax loopholes have valid uses, but can also be abused. It's like when you have a hammer. You can use it to hammer in nails, you can use it to hammer in the skull of your neighbour. So you have to find a way to disable the hammer for use as a murderweapon, but keep it working as a way to hammer in nails. And I am not sure that Italy does not have those loopholes. Italy does have less tax treaties than the Netherlands (I have no idea how many tax treaties Italy has, but I do know the Netherlands has the most of any country in the world). Companies who want to work all over the world and prevent double taxation all over the world are therefore better off to work through the Netherlands, because whatever country they want to do business with, chances are the Netherlands has it covered with a tax treaty).

Now to stop the abuse, they are trying to implement anti-abuse clauses into these treaties if I understand correctly. Which is basically saying: you can use this, but only if you really are a company with a real presence in the Netherlands, because otherwise you're probably just up to weird shenanigans. And then you get into grey areas, because what exactly is a real presence? And there are probably are other grey areas as well.

And another hold-up could be that all this is written down in treaties with other countries. So it's not just the Netherlands who has to agree to change it, but the other country needs to agree to it as well. Lots of these treaties are old, from before when tax avoidance was an issue, so when they were first signed, nobody thought about that. 

I've looked it up, but I can't find any good english sources. But this is a link to a letter of the Dutch ministry of finance back in 2012/2013  about the subject. It is long and it is in Dutch, but if you're really interested you could pull it through google translate and read it.

The main problem you will have is discerning  in that noise which part of the agreement or negotiation is an attempt to solve a problem and which is just the interest groups inside the EU fighting for dominance.

Every country has their interest group that wants to screw the others.  The interest groups in Germany will want to get a deal that will allow them to get more stuff from Italy at discount prices.  The interest groups in Italy will want free money from Germany.

The EU itself as a separate interest group will want to keep everything as it is and working with a constructive compromise that will empower its institutions at the expense of national ones.

It's a mess. And we are in a mess. And as it happens in such situations we often find out that way too many people in charge are idiots screaming for attention and self-validation.

1594,"&gt; Not even 24 hours ago Hoekstra himself declared that the Eurogroup would be pursuing a two-track ESM policy; a conditionless healthcare aid package, and an austere recession package for later.

You should read what he actually said. He said with conditions. But what those conditions are, are up for grabs.

Furthermore what you saw was a briliant piece of eurocrat engineering designed to allow everybody to claim victory and nobody seem like a loser:

Two seperate packages were agreed upon, both deliberately vague while promesing a lot. The conditionless healthcare aid package is huge and not limited to direct health care cost, but also undefined 'indirect' costs. You can run pretty far with such a broad description.

&gt;On the question of legality; QE is not a settled matter in the German constitutional court.

They only have juristiction over the Bundesbank. They cannot prevent other national banks from participating. So while it would make the program less effective, it doesn't make it impossible.

So again: you have one thing which is definitely illegal, and one is probably legal. How do you choose the illegal one.

You talk about kicking the can down the road. What do you think will happen when German agrees to eurobonds and the constitutional court will invariably ban them a few years later? Then you are in a world of hurt.

1607,"It's not really comparable to anything in the US because US federal corporate taxes - like US federal income taxes, for that matter - are the primary source of revenue and are collected in every state, regardless of whether that state has its own income tax or not. 

Imagine a corporation headquartered in Illinois but doing business across the US. That Corp would pay the federal 25% rate on its profits. That money would go to the treasury and be spent by Congress and be part of the federal budget that is used to pay for things in every state. 

But it doesn't really matter what state the corporation is is in - Delaware, Indiana, New York, Hawaii - it's still going to have to pay the 25% federal corporations tax. 

Most states also impose their own corporation tax (about 10 don't); these tend to be around 5-6%. The state taxes goes purely to that state, for its own purposes. 

A corp deciding to headquarter in IL rather than Ind. means that IL gets to collect its 5% tax rate and Ind. doesn't get to collect it's 5% tax rate. But Ind. still gets a share of the 25% federal rate. 

In the EU *there is no federal rate*. There are no EU wide taxes like that.

So if a company sets up in Germany, it might pay Germany's 25% rate - but all of that money is Germany's to keep because, again, there is no EU rate. 

Or - and this is the actual crux of the matter - the corp could set up in a country with (an effective) 6% tax rate. Again, this 6% belongs entirely to the country in which the corporation is headquartered; there is no EU wide tax that is also collected.  So Germany gets nothing. Even if the company does most of its business in Germany.

And of course corporations would rather HQ in the low-tax countries. 

*Internationally*, this is *usually* not an issue because the foreign corporation has to set up a foreign HQ to do meaningful business in the foreign country, and the profits from that country are taxed at that country's rate.

Thus Roche Diagnostic US is a US subsidiary of the Swiss multinational company; Ford Europe AG is the German subsidiary of the US car company. 


However, because of the single market, Ford is not required to set up a HQ in each country in the EU; setting up in just one member is enough. 

So if a lot of foreign companies set up in very low tax countries in the EU, they can do business throughout the EU, but the only EU country that receives any corporate tax is the country they headquartered in.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fxp6q8/time_for_the_eu_to_close_its_own_tax_havens/fn22mxb/,thewimsey,1586576217

https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-your-own-sourdough-starter-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-47337

&gt; Before we had active-dry yeast or instant yeast, we had wild yeast. Actually, we still have wild yeast. It lives *everywhere* — in the air, in a bag of flour, on the surface of grapes. Domesticated commercial yeast replaced wild yeast for most baking because it’s easier for companies to mass produce, it’s easier for bakers to store and use, and it proofs our breads and pastries in a fraction of the time.

-

&gt;  A sourdough starter is how we cultivate the wild yeast in a form that we can use for baking. Since wild yeast are present in all flour, the easiest way to make a starter is simply by combining flour and water and letting it sit for several days. You don’t need any fancy ingredients to “capture” the wild yeast or get it going — it’s already there in the flour. (Also, the yeast adapts to whatever environment it is in. So even if your cousin in San Francisco gives you some sourdough starter, it will eventually no longer be true San Francisco sourdough, but rather New York sourdough or Austin sourdough or London sourdough.) 
&gt;
&gt;After a day or two, bubbles will start to form in the starter, indicating that the wild yeast is starting to become active and multiply. To keep the yeast happy, we feed the starter with fresh flour and water over the next several days, until the starter is bubbly and billowy. Once it reaches that frothy, billowy stage, the starter is ready to be used.

3) No really rich people get their money through ""income"" because the ability to amass large amounts of capital and assets eventually puts you in a ""can't lose"" position, provided you are fiscally responsible, so the tax is nothing in the long run anyway.

You family should turn 4k euros per month of that 7k euros salary into capital and assets, and then you'll rich the rest of your lives. That's literally a property to rent out every few years for the rest of your lives. That's nothing to cry about. 

You should be glad you are one of the last nations that gets to live in that utopian bubble of nationally homogeneous prosperity, wealth, and societal cohesion before globalism comes and puts you in your place with the rest of us. That's worth the 56% tax on your dad's income. In terms of skill or ability, your dad does nothing in reality that warrants your family being rich the rest of your lives; you should be glad that live in a system that allows you to amass capital and profit of its mere existence at all, and extremely glad that you're lucky enough to be in a position in which family can garner a surplus that accrues over time.

In the mid-90s we had a proper recession in italy we started to see our competitiveness decline we were coming from a period of unprecedented success in the 80s, but we weren't adapting to new technologies as fast. In addition to that there was some political unrest (mani pulite) that made the response slower and less effective. In trying to make up for the time lost italy started to run a deficit to catch up. The Euro came into place a few years after ('99) and instead of helping put us in an even less competitive situation. We wanted to make it a success though. Everybody was super positive about our entrance into the euro and it was great for a few years, we were able to recover. We greatly reduced our debt from 122% GDP/debt ratio in the 90s to slightly under 100% in mid 2000s. Then shit hit the fan and the debt exploded and that has been it since then.

But what about Germany? Their products became more competitive because since the euro they are now having an undervalued currency and most of their trade is intra UE. That's an enormous benefit. They are doing what Italy did before. Staying competitive having a devalued currency. So what's the difference? None. 

It's also the same thing China is doing and why Trump got so angry. 

It's not me making up this story. Go check what economists and nobel prize winners in economics say about this. 

Going back to the lira would make our products competitive again. And by increasing the GDP the debt burden becomes more sustainable. Problem is, since the financial crisis our GDP never grew because of the euro. 

Moreover, our budget has a positive balance before interest payments. Our only problem is market speculation that made us pay such high interests in the past. With a central bank that back our debt market speculation, for definition is impossible. The interest rate would be lower (of course initially there will be some inflation so the nominal interest rate would be higher, but the real interest rate would still be low.....and in the medium term it's gonna be low even in nominal terms with the right policies....again there were multiple studies done for this too showing a multitude of scenario analysis). 

How can we stay competitive while having the euro? that's almost impossible. Only way to make our products competitive is reducing the cost of products and so reducing the salaries. Salaries in Italy are already low now, and to make the products competitive would have to decrease by a lot. 

It would never happen. Italians don't want a 400€ per month salary, they can't even live with it because prices are high. 

And why would they even accept? There is an easy solution which is getting rid of the euro and have our own local currency. 

As for the EU it's different. Italy wants to exit the euro. If it can stay in the EU good, otherwise good too. One of the problem here is that staying in the EU would probably mean having a currency somewhat pegged to the euro and we don't want that. That's why I say in the end we will leave both the euro and the EU.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/fypxfl/italys_conte_threatens_to_derail_eu_summit_over/fn1s4v3/,Most_Champion,1586568833

I get that there is a problem in the US with people not taking it seriously enough, but here it's the opposite, we're behaving as if the apocalypse has already happened. For perspective, there's 700 confirmed cases in this whole country, but we've been behaving like it's Chernobyl since case \~50.  


Furthermore, the actual mortality rate based on the latest German data (where they finally did random sampling and found out that 15% percent of population in that area already had the virus) is much lower than the number of deaths divided by number of confirmed cases.. for the simple reason that the vast majority of cases in most places are untracked.  
Results from the Diamond Princess also seem to confirm that the actual death rate is much lower, especially since most of those infected on that ship were 69 years old on average and only 12 out of the \~700 died, most are recovered at the moment of writing this.  


The high number of deaths is mostly a vastly higher number of infected than is tracked in the official data. You can see how countries with more tests per 1m population ([sort it by Tests/1m Pop](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries)) have lesser mortality, that's because the relative large number of tests catches more of the infected than in other countries where a larger proportion of the ones tested are people who go to the doctor by themselves. The vast majority of cases seems to have only mild or no  symptoms at all (and asymptomatic people have a lower chance to transmit it, but there's a lot more of them than known cases).",,/r/europe/comments/fympib/how_viktor_orbán_used_the_coronavirus_to_seize/fn1silj/,nikto123,1586569083

1729,"CLICHY-SOUS-BOIS, France — The young men, immigrants with no papers and nowhere to go, chatted at
close quarters outside the shopping strip, social distancing be damned. Above loomed the shabby facade of one
of France’s most notorious housing blocks, packed with families waiting out confinement.
The pain of the moment is concentrated in this dense, impoverished district of the Paris immigrant suburbs,
one of four French areas, including Paris and Alsace, hit by “an exceptional excess” of coronavirus deaths,
France’s national health director said this week.
Much of Paris — perhaps a quarter of the population — packed up and went off to the countryside when the
French government announced strict confinement rules on March 16. But just across the line in Seine-SaintDenis, France’s poorest department, people didn’t have that choice.
Inside the Paris city limits, the streets are now as quiet as any French provincial town on a Sunday; in the
suburbs the streets are mostly empty too. But the apartments are full.

The grim and tired faces of the residents, lining up to get into the post office or the supermarket in the worn
shopping strip, tell the story: small public housing apartments packed with families, jobs that have
disappeared and an aggressive police force clamping down on youth restless with the confinement rules.
The combination of cramped quarters, acute economic stress and tough policing has made Paris’s poorer
suburbs a more dangerous place for the virus to spread, as well as a special source of tension during the
epidemic.
Relations between residents and the police, with their undercurrent of racial discrimination, are often fraught
even in the best of times, and the current lockdown is not one of them.
Over and over, residents compared the confinement rules to conditions in a prison, and they charged that the
police were taking advantage of their mandate to keep the streets clear by harassing, even beating, youths, no
questions asked. Some are warning that the pressures are ripe to explode.
“We’ve got a lot of young people in big families, shut up in tiny apartments, and it’s difficult to close them up
like that,” said Bilal Chikri, a filmmaker who lives in the neighborhood. “There’s a lot of clashes with the police,
lots of police missteps, lots of abuse of power.”",,/r/europe/comments/fytu84/like_a_prison_paris_suburbs_simmer_under/fn1srie/,Le_Updoot_Army,1586569249

1732,"The approach has left residents vulnerable to both the police and the virus. Paris had 732 virus deaths
compared with 402 in Seine-Saint-Denis as of April 8, but the city has half again the population of the suburb,
where many of the metropolis’s cashiers, deliverymen, transit workers, nurses and couriers live.
“This is getting really tough,” said Larry Karache, an out-of-work shopkeeper, standing outside Chêne Pointu,
the housing project where France’s 2005 urban riots were born, and which was depicted in last year’s hit film
“Les Miserables.” “We’re actually in prison here.”
“People can’t support their families anymore,’’ he added. “And with the cops now, it’s all about score-settling.”

The stresses, from a lack of money and small spaces, were accumulating.
“It’s like a prison. There are three of us in two rooms,” said Drissa Fofana, an out-of-work construction worker.
“But we’ve got to accept it. If this goes on, the little that we’ve got saved up will be all gone,” he said.

Another resident, Mama Traoré, echoed the complaint. “It’s hard,” she said, grimacing as she bent over her
shopping cart outside the post office at Chêne Pointu. “I’ve got four kids and three rooms. Too small. With all
the noise, I’ve always got a headache.”
Outside the apartment blocks, small groups gather, here and there, mostly at bus stops. But the wide streets
are largely quiet.
“On the whole, people are respecting the confinement rules,” said Hamza Esmili, a sociologist who has studied
the Paris suburbs. “There isn’t a sort of collective indiscipline about it.”
“But the illness has the potential to continue spreading,” Mr. Esmili warned.
The real danger comes not from people congregating outside, but from the cramped apartments where
extended families are packed.
“On the exterior, the confinement is being observed,” said Frédéric Adnet, head of emergency services in the
Seine-Saint-Denis department. “It’s not there that the problem is playing out.”
“We’re seeing whole families arrive in the emergency rooms,” he said. “There’s familial contamination. People
live, five or six, in little, little apartments.”
Paris had its exodus to country homes. “We didn’t see that in the Seine-Saint-Denis,” Mr. Adnet said. “They
don’t have country homes here. So we didn’t benefit from that drop in the population.”
In the last few days the pressure on the area’s three public hospitals has eased a little, officials said. But the
tension inside the tired old apartment blocks is spilling into the streets.
The French police have come down hard, in the accounts of several residents, responding to perceived lapses
in the confinement rules with beatings, harassment, humiliation and intimidation.
A coalition of rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, denounced “unacceptable and illegal behavior” by
the police in the Paris suburbs in a March 27 statement, saying the health crisis “doesn’t mean a break with the
rule of law and doesn’t justify discriminatory checks or unjustified force.”
It noted that these abuses “are common, and rarely punished” in France.
A leading police union, in a post on Twitter, called the residents’ accounts “fables,” and blamed them on “little
Dzerjinskis” — a reference to a celebrated Bolshevik revolutionary — who are “holed up in the Latin Quarter,
or their country homes.”
But the accounts are consistent, widespread and tied to the French government’s confinement rules. Since
March 17 authorities have demanded a self-signed interior ministry release form giving one of four
preapproved reasons for being outside.
In the Paris suburbs, if the police catch you without the form, or if there is an error on it, you are in trouble,
residents said.
“The police just jump in, just like that, with force,” said Fiston Kabunda, who works as a mediator for the city of
Clichy-sous-Bois. “There’s no discussion.”
“It’s an abuse of power: ʻWe’re going to beat up some black and Arab,’” he added.
“Look, it’s like this: The police come, and they start to beat up on the kids,” he said. “They’re not even checking
them. It’s brutality, no questions asked.”",,/r/europe/comments/fytu84/like_a_prison_paris_suburbs_simmer_under/fn1suyn/,Le_Updoot_Army,1586569311

1734,"A spokesman for the police prefecture of Paris, which is responsible for Seine-Saint-Denis, said the police
would not comment on accusations that were “not specific.”
Mr. Chikri, the filmmaker, said he had forgotten his release form in his car when a group of police surrounded
him last week, threw him to the ground, handcuffed him, kicked him and squeezed his carotid artery. “You can
stuff your release form,” the police told him, Mr. Chikri recalled.
“With these guys, it’s all hatred and violence,” he said.
The police in Paris did not respond to a specific inquiry about Mr. Chikri’s accusations.
In a video widely circulating on French social media, a young man in the suburb of Les Ulis can be heard
screaming in pain during a police “check” for a missing release form.
“He was savagely beaten with truncheons, fists and kicks until he fell to the ground, but the punishment
continued,” said a criminal complaint filed on behalf of Sofiane Naoufel El Allaki, a 21-year-old deliveryman for
Amazon, by a Paris human rights lawyer, Samim Bolaky.
“The screams of Mr. El Allaki penetrated the whole neighborhood,” the complaint said.
“This is not about confrontation,” Mr. Bolaky said. “This is not urban violence. The streets are deserted. They
didn’t even ask him for his release form. He didn’t resist at all.”
The police in the Essone department, where the incident took place, did not respond to a specific inquiry about
Mr. El Allaki’s claims. Mr. El Allaki’s case is one of several involving police violence being investigated by
prosecutors.
Mr. Esmili, the sociologist, warned that the way the authorities were enforcing the lockdown was only
reinforcing the worst expectations of many in France’s poorest areas.
“Look, the state is completely ignoring how people live in these neighborhoods,” he said. “Its only response to
them is an excess of authoritarianism. And the people are beginning to understand, the only response is police force.”",,/r/europe/comments/fytu84/like_a_prison_paris_suburbs_simmer_under/fn1sx33/,Le_Updoot_Army,1586569350

1750,"&gt; It's not me making up this story. Go check what economists and nobel prize winners in economics say about this.

You think you are telling me anything I didn't know already?

Yes Italy has always inflated and devaluated its currency to insulate its industry from competitive pressures. And that is exactly why you find yourself in the deep shit you are now, and why Northern Europe is prospering. Northern Europe always sought to compete, southern Europe sought to protect. In a world where protection is no longer an option, you are in deep shit. If you believe that going back to Lira will allow you to insulate your economy again you are very much mistaken. That word doesn't exist anymore. You now have to compete against Eastern European and East Asian manufacturers. Good luck with that.

You need to change, and you need to restructure your economy. You need to become more competitive without resorting to monetary policy. If you don't, you are doomed to fail. It is a long and painful proces, and you are nowhere near done. We went through pretty much the same thing you are going through now, [but in the 70s and 80s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease). It took till the late '90s until we truly recovered. We recovered because we changed, we made massive cuts to a bloated welfare state. And we recovered because we invested in a new generation who could take advantages of new opportunities. And we recovered because labour participation rates shot op (due to women entering the work force).

&gt;Our only problem is market speculation that made us pay such high interests in the past.

Your problem with leaving the Euro is that your debts are registered in euros, and you propose devaluating your currency. This will just shoot up your debt. If you think you are in a bad debt situation now, well that would get a lot worse all of a sudden.

You would also scare away all foreign direct investment. Italy would be such an incredibily risky investment that nobody will get aboard (or will ask for higher interest rates to make it viable).

Yes, you could use your own central bank to try and inflate your way out of it, which will make your whole situation worse. (Besides the ECB is fully backing you right now, so you don't need your own central bank for that.)

What you propose, to put it succintly, is entering into a massive debt spiral from which you'll never recover. Especially not with your ancient population.

When Conte says ""this could be the end of the EU"" he doesn't mean it as an emotional blackmail, WTF. It's so insulting that some people on this forum see it like this. He means that the response to this crisis must be symbolically strong, not just pragmatically sound. Because anti euro sentiments are strong, so the effort to counter them must be equally strong and yes, equally ""sentimental"" if you like.

1756,"But part of our extraordinary crisis is an incoming Depression-level event. Italy is too big to bail. If it passes no major stimulus, it’s debt skyrockets (due to automatic stabilizers). If Italy tries to pass a stimulus on it’s own dime, either it’s yields skyrocket or the ECB must monetize it (against the ECBs founding treaty). Phased Eurobonds and fiscal stimulus are the only way to prevent an Italian crisis - which, make no mistake, would break the Euro.

This is becoming completely unavoidable at this point, especially since it's the Union itself that is doing absolutely nothing to defend those values.

1789,"&gt;You are just malevolently ignorant.

By sticking to facts?

&gt;And what you are doing is malevolent fearmongering.

In what way, looking at facts objectively and rationally concluding that Russia is a hostile and dangerous country to us?

&gt;Let's re-state it. Estonia (right?) was officially part of Russian empire since 1721. It gained independence for the first time as ""Estonia"" in 1918 and it lost it when the Soviet Union occupied and annexed it in 1939.

In 1940, but whatever.. And it illegally occupied Estonia, the annexation was legally null and void.

&gt;Then it was part of the Soviet Union as a federative republic until 1991.

As I said, illegally occupied, not a legal part of it.

&gt;""You"" were invaded once.

Well, yes, if you forget the 1941 German invasion and 1944 Soviet re-invasion of course, but still, whatever.

&gt;And then they left after 1991 and never bothered to come back...

And?

&gt;Because after all both the invasion in 1939 and the departure in 1991 were grounded in rational strategy that Moscow employed.

Ah, that rational imperialistic strategy...

&gt;So this idiotic rhetoric that you are demonstrating here, this hysterical shrieking filled with fear mixed with anger is properly ""malevolent"".

More like commonly accepted rhetoric by all NATO member states, essentially all educated people in that field and essentially all locals... Well, essentially everyone but Russia and its few cronies...

&gt;Considering the extent to which British intelligence is running Estonian media for you

Lol, so you're this type of guy...

&gt;I wonder how aware you even are that there was an actual period in Estonian history - short as it were in the interbellum - when you tried to develop a rational view of geopolitics. Because you are not showing it here.

I am sorry, I didn't know I would have to mention the Interbellum years in every comment to prove myself to some random Redditor.

&gt;This is just pathetic ""Russia evil reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee""

What a pathetic way to defend a hostile imperialistic dictatorship...

&gt;that is precisely what the Americans and the British are working on. A Pavlovian, reflexive, thoughtless response.

I think the Americans and the British had nothing to do with this reaction, it was all caused by the Soviets themselves.

&gt;And all I am saying is that Russia will attempt to invade Estonia when it sees it as advantageous to its interest and will not attempt to invade Estonia when it sees it as disadvantageous.

Well, duh...

&gt;It doesn't mean ""Russia bestest"" you sad excuse for an intelligent human being. 

What?

&gt;It simply means: right now the probability of Russian invasion is very low.

I wouldn't say very low, but low enough. But I don't see why that should stop us from developing our defence policy for the days where it may become more advantageous and more likely.

&gt;Why? Because of the very logical reasons I explained earlier.

But you haven't been logical? Or was there another high school essay of yours somewhere in the comments?

&gt;Can you stop your pathetic hysteria

What hysteria?

1790,"&gt;My argument is moneytreess dont exist.

100% invalid arguement:

1. Three weeks before, the greek government funded private clinics with 30 million euros for the purposes of testing for diagnosis !?! while the only lab at that time performing diagnostic tests was the Paster Institute. Private clinics got funded not to analyze, but to collect and send the samples to another institute for testing.
2. Three weeks before, the greek government approved the funding of media owners with another 11 million euros gift, for the purposes of advertising coronavirus spots !?! Bullshit! That's blatant bribery.

&gt;There are [some](https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/ygeia/238218_me-diamartyries-sta-nosokomeia-kai-entasi-ston-eyaggelismo-i-imera-ygeias-stin) who complain in the middle of a crisis guess what ideology they are.

The way you address things discloses your hard ignorance. They are not ""some"", they are doctors and nurses, complaining for the lack of protective gear in nearly every fucking hospital in Athens. They demand protective equipment, more ICU and more professionals to handle the upcoming explosion, especially now that more and more doctors and nurses are being daily diagnosed with the virus. And yet, you are blaming those that will take care of your sad ass when the virus will infect you.

&gt;We dont need to hire if we fix as we do the problem before hits the helth care system.

1974,"The reason for engineers leaving is wages, and indeed in terms of comparative purchasing power. I think you're focusing on the market in Luxembourg too much. Not all countries have or need to develop capital intensive markets if that's not what they have a comparative advantage at. 

Factually speaking the debt and equity markets in Europe are very weak compared to US or China. Even in Germany most companies developed as family ran businesses with capital from founders or financing through banks, not capital markets. It's helpful to have that, but it's not necessary for economic success, at least for the type of economies most European countries have. 

 To increase wages for engineers you increases competition on the related markets, making companies compete for filling in jobs and for people in demand. You're looking at supply side. Yes, obtaining financing would make it easier for companies to start up and hire more people, but that's not why those companies come into existence. They come into existence due to increase of demand for their services something that is primarily driven by price. This is a demand driven solution. 

Making it easier for them to operate due to less beaurocacy might be good, decrease in tax burden very important, but without the demand existing all of that wouldn't matter.

1992,"The country believed itself to be armed, but was particularly ill-equipped for the corona crisis. Many French people now resent the government for this. Especially the medical staff is furious. A chronology.

&amp;#x200B;

Paris. No, masks were not needed against Covid-19, French government officials claimed for weeks. Now it turns out that the government has deceived the population because in reality nothing was prepared for an emergency. The alleged stocks of masks were hardly available. A report in the online magazine ""Médiapart"" entitled ""Masks: the evidence of a state lie"" records how in France the government and health authorities decided too late or wrongly.

&amp;#x200B;

Like the rest of Europe, France is looking at China in horror. No additional precautions are being taken. Officially, there is supposedly a sufficient reserve of 80 million protective masks. Of the FFP2 masks recommended for medical use, however, the state had not set up stocks for times of crisis, as responsibility for this protective material was transferred to private and public companies in 2013. The national health directorate DGS, headed by Professor Jérôme Salomon, secretly suspects that the masks for exposed medical personnel will be lacking.

&amp;#x200B;

Two first Covid cases in France. Health minister Agnès Buzyn declared against her better judgment: ""The risk of spreading is very low."" Two days later she assures that the state has ""stocks of tens of millions of masks that can be distributed in case of emergency"".

&amp;#x200B;

When DGS decides to order FFP2 masks for hospitals, the demand from manufacturers in Europe and the Far East is already enormous. Of the 28 million masks ordered, France only gets half a million. Even of the less efficient ""surgical masks"", only 30 million instead of 160 million could be procured in a hurry.

&amp;#x200B;

Buzyn's successor Olivier Véran assures that the Ministry of Health has been anticipating the situation in France ""for weeks"". DGS head Salomon affirms: ""The shortage is not an issue."" The omitted precautions are now to be covered up by massive and urgent procurements.

&amp;#x200B;

By decree, the government decides to confiscate all available masks. The four remaining producers are to supply the French state exclusively, and all exports - including to EU countries - are to be prohibited. The yield of this belated hunt for stocked masks remains extremely meagre. Not only numerous hospitals, but also old people's homes, as well as freelance doctors, nurses, carers, policemen and firefighters have too few protective masks and disinfectant gel.

&amp;#x200B;

In view of the shortage, President Macron decreed that the confiscated protective masks were to be used exclusively in hospitals. The media reports cases of theft.

&amp;#x200B;

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe closes restaurants, bars, cafés and shops as well as schools, universities and kindergartens. He imposes curfews.

&amp;#x200B;

In France, 148 people have died of Covid-19. Despite concerns, the first round of local elections is held. Voter turnout falls by 20 percent.

The new Minister of Health, Olivier Véran, confirms that at the end of January, the state only had a reserve of 150 million simple ""surgical masks"", but no emergency stock of FFP2 masks - of which only one million have since been procured for public hospitals.

Government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye claims that wearing masks is counterproductive for the population: ""You can't buy masks in pharmacies because it's not necessary if you're not sick (yourself). I could not use a mask myself. It requires technical skill to use it.""

&amp;#x200B;

Under pressure, Véran confirmed that he had ordered ""one billion masks"" abroad and in France. An airlift with China would be arranged for this purpose. Soon it becomes clear that the company Geodis, a branch of the state railway SNCF, which is in charge of this, is missing the planes.

&amp;#x200B;

Macron visits one of the four factories near Angers that still produce masks in France. These are to produce ten million per week by the end of April. The demand of the public health system is estimated at 40 million per week. During his appearance, the president pleads for ""national and European sovereignty"" in medical and pharmaceutical care. He refuses any criticism.

&amp;#x200B;

After France's Académie de Medecine had spoken out in favour of the compulsory wearing of masks by the population, Professor Salomon, who had previously declared this protective measure to be ""useless"", made a 180-degree turn: ""We encourage the population to wear masks if they so wish"".

&amp;#x200B;

Beginning of April: Several cities like Nice want to make the wearing of (if necessary self-made) protective masks compulsory. Secretary of State Agnès Pannier-Runacher admits that at the end of the initial restrictions, the population will have to be ""massively"" equipped with masks. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that the ""billions of masks ordered"", which have so far been very scarce, would be delivered from China ""by the end of June"". On Easter Monday, President Emmanuel Macron will address the nation in a TV speech.

&amp;#x200B;

The errors and confusion have undermined the authority of the government. The inability to provide at least the medical staff with the protective masks and the attempt to justify the incompetence with pseudo-scientific arguments has caused outrage in medical circles. Jean-Paul Hamon, the chairman of the General Practitioners' Association, himself a Covid-19 sufferer, says: ""This is no longer just anger, this is downright hate.""

&gt; were treason 

Then we should also state that actions of Dubcek and co were violation of international treaties he has signed as part of Eastern bloc. He and his people undermined whole bloc policies - and that's why not only soviet, but other countries too participated in that. 

&gt; none of those people held any meaningful position

If you were occupied, why military had to move in 1968 (to move out in same 1968 mostly)? 

What a weird ""occupation"" - no occupant army, no occupant government, hell, even opposition to eastern bloc government in 1968. 

You cannot twist meaning of word ""occupation"" as you like. Either use it by original meaning or find another one. Influenced? Yes. Signed to obey Eastern bloc policies? Yes. Occupied? No.

&gt; And Polish representation was massacred since and during WW2 

You mean authorities who were ex-Hitler allies? Because with rulers representing Polish People's Republic this didn't happen. 

&gt;  And East Germany was completely occupied since the war ended. 

Define ""completely occupied""? I think you don't understand the meaning of word ""occupation"". They were autonomous in various decisions.

&gt; Czechoslovakia would not become another Vietnam 

What makes you think so? Yugoslavia example shows that it's only your optimism, rather than fact.

2223,"Big welfare system and being accustomed to high employment will do that. 

I can only compare with the UK, but strikes me that in much of mainland Northern Europe, societal expectations are different. Higher taxes, more social support, stronger unions, and employee-favourable contract laws mean that the difference between a highly skilled professional with university degree and a full-time contract in a solid semi-skilled job with the requisite vocational qualification is less pronounced. 

For example, the difference between a supermarket floor manager, with only school level education and vocational training in being a supermarket floor manager, and an engineer in a contracted position in a company is probably only a matter of a slightly larger house or flat, a more expensive car, and the ability to take more expensive holidays every year. 

After tax, the difference between say, 2800 € monthly salary and 4500 € monthly salary is not that much. Could be the difference between actually taking home 2000 € net at the end of the month vs 2900 €, once all taxes and mandatory health and pension contributions have been accounted for.

I do not mean it in a way of ""being lazy"", but I think, if someone grew up in a socialist atmosphere, in which the state, the society, tells you what to do and what not (like where to live and what job to work at), it is pretty difficult to suddenly deal with the freedom (and responsibility!) the modern european society is offering to you.

The fact, that authoritarian parties are stronger in the east than in the west, results directly from this clash of mind-sets, I tried to describe before.

2448,"&gt;I see the Italian brigade is back in town, nothing but emotional blackmail and fairy tales about Italian economic policies.""  Yeah that doesn't sound racist at all.

No it isn't,first of all, Italians aren't a race, secondly, Italians are brigading this sub with emotional blackmail. ""If you do not give us money now the EU will explode"" ""if you don't give us money now we will leave the EU"" and my favorite ""we are dying because of the EU"" or ""&lt;insert something hurtful or untrue about the north&gt;""

&gt; ""Italians are lazy and corrupted"" or ""black people are rapists"", but  often those thoughts are the implicit reason behind some attitude,  

Strange how i only see people with an Italian flair boost this and then turn around and blame northerners for saying it.

&gt; and it's for sure behind your attitude right now, and it's not even hidden well as your anger is very visible. 

Yes, we are angry because we are being emotionally blackmailed, just like you are doing right now. Pointing out how bad all these northerners are while not wanting to look at all the poison you lot are spewing. All while threatening to leave the EU or have it implode by their actions. But sure, we should not be angry at people spewing hate about us, right!?

&gt; Anyway, it's probably going to be a waste of time, But I'll try... You  think that Italy just wants your money to keep its crazy public spending  without consequences, using the covid as an excuse. 

See, right here, this is what we call a strawman or a fallacy, no one ever argued that Italy just wants money. What is argued is that Italy didn't have their finances in order. But whenever that is said then suddenly Italians go ""but we are a net contributor"", no one every claimed different, but that doesn't excuse the mountain of debt that has been left for years.

&gt; That's not it; Italy (and Spain, France, Portugal..) will need money to  invest to help the economy from collapse, because this pandemic will hit  it hard. Getting this money from the private market would be crazy  because we would end up paying sky high interests, and that's where the  EU could help. 

And what is the reason that Italy can't borrow on private markets? It is because of the large debt that has been there for ages. The northern countries have always been willing to help, just not with common bonds that will draw us into your mess and doesn't give any incentive for southern countries to get their shit in order. Northern countries have been living in austerity for ages too, that is why we are able now to help. But from here it almost seems as if this help isn't wanted. The Netherlands came with a plan for quick donations to care for the brunt of the medical expenses with no strings attached as a gift. This was flat out not accepted by the southern countries, as they wanted common bonds.

&gt; Now, if north European countries want more control on how we'll spend  money, they shall have it. Discussions are normal in this situation and  I'm not saying you should say yes to everything.  But you cannot accuse  Italy of being parasitic or blackmailing for money: the epidemic is the  very reason for all this mess, without it there would have been no  debate and no request. Italy has never accessed the ESM before, on the  contrary they contributed to it. 

The northern European countries don't want more control on how you'll spend money. They want you to get your shit in order and ensure that this wont happen again this easily.

We can accuse you of emotional blackmail because that is what it is. Saying that if you do not help us the way we want help or we will do this or that is exactly what emotional blackmail is. 

No one is saying that Italy is being parasitic except for people with an Italian flair, or at least they are the ones saying it most often. This isn't about access to the ESM, this is about fairy tales of keeping in line with EU regulations as clearly this hasn't happened with a debt that is (correct me if im wrong) 140% of GDP. 

I hear a lot of southerns complaining about austerity, but its not as if the northern countries haven't been doing this just as hard if not harder.

&gt; About the debt and us not following the European rules because of it,  you are again showing some superficiality about the matter. Yeah the  debt is high, it is a burden on us. But consider that it was piled up  mostly in the 80's and you really cannot expect a country to reduce it  in a few years. That would require cutting public spending so bad that  would cause a recession.  It requires time and it's been years that  Italy has lowered it public spending. Now we pay sky high taxes for less  services then others and we work longer than almost every European  countries for lower wages. I'm not blaming anyone but old Italian  governments for it, but you can't say that Italy was doing nothing to  fix its finances because it's just wrong and it's where the stereotypes  comes out.  So if you think Italians right now are just trying to use  the epidemic as an excuse to get money from you and keep going with  their unsustainably lazy way of life, then think again because you are  dead wrong. 

No that burden isn't on you, you want to place that burden partially with the rest of the union through common bonds. 

Every country had a high debt coming out of the 80's, and that is nothing more then an excuse for not taking the measures that are needed.

Most people have really bad experiences with Romanians. For example, in the city where I live the Government recently renovated a house.

In fact, when I lived there, I lived with two Italian students, and we all lived with a Spanish family. None of us were fluent in anyone else's language (we were all studying), so our conversations at the dinner table were everyone switching between bad English and bad Spanish and bad Italian and bad French and a little bit of bad German, but we had so much fun. Because of that summer, a year later, I took a job in Rome and one of those Italian guys moved to America. Neither one of us would have done that if we hadn't lived together. I left a piece of my heart in Valencia (and another piece in Rome!). Sure, the city is wonderful, but the fact that people can share a life so *easily* there is what makes it special.

&gt; The Italians should have taken the De Gaulle approach. Tell them I won't show up to the meetings (which basically means nothing gets done without the signature of everyone) until you give me what I want


But that wasn't De Gaulle's approach. He vetoed on allowing the UK into the common market but he didn't use it to try and force other policy. It's not comparable at all in that sense.

For Italy to veto aid to other countries would effectively be political suicide. It would be an absolutely awful way to try and force coronabonds and would unify countries on the fence in opposition against them. Even countries like Spain who support coronabonds would turn against Italy as they would be stopping much needed aid to their country.

It would be quite possibly the worst possible way to try and get coronabonds and would almost certainly make them politically impossible due to the optics of being strongarmed into it.",,/r/europe/comments/fy2qzf/eli5_why_the_agreement_that_was_reached_isnt/fmyrbcw/,YoullNeverMemeAlone,1586493463

Although disparities are smaller when adjusting for differences in price level across countries (26% - 156%), the figures in this article are expressed in euros.

Two of the top-five EU regions in terms of primary income per inhabitant, following Luxembourg, were located in Germany (Oberbayern and Stuttgart, with a primary income of €37 000 and €32 500 per inhabitant respectively). Other regions that featured in the top-five included the Hovedstaden region in Denmark (€34 600 per inhabitant) and Stockholm in Sweden (€33 400 per inhabitant).

By contrast, in the bottom five, Severozapaden was also joined by other Bulgarian regions including Severoiztochen (with a primary income per inhabitant of €3 100), Yuzhen tsentralen and Severen tsentralen (both €3 300 per inhabitant) and Yugoiztochen (€3 400 per inhabitant). Outside of Bulgaria, the Nord-Est region of Romania was also in the bottom five (with a primary income per inhabitant of €3 400).

 In 2017, 49 regions across 11 countries had a primary income per inhabitant in excess of €26 000: Denmark (all regions), more than half of the regions of Germany (22 out of 38) and Austria (5 out of 9), around half of the regions of Belgium (5 out of 11), a third of regions of the Netherlands (4 out of 12) and Ireland (1 out of 3), 2 regions from Finland (out of 5) and Sweden (out of 8), 1 region in both France (out of 27) and Italy (out of 21) as well as Luxembourg (single region).

At the other end of the scale, 50 regions had a primary income per inhabitant below €9 000. These were regions from 10 countries: all regions of Bulgaria, Hungary (except Budapest), Poland (except Warsaw), Romania (except Bucharest) and Slovakia (except Bratislava), around half of the Greek regions, one region in France, Croatia and Lithuania as well as Latvia (single region).

2983," The Siglas also known as Marcas development is at least partly, attributed to the Norsemen that settled in the town during the 10th century and 11th century. This form of primitive writing developed within the community of Póvoa de Varzim was kept due to the practice of endogamy. Also, the ‘marcas’ similarity with the Scandinavian tradition of using specific *bomärken* (""homestead marks"") for signatures and for marking property is worthy of note.

Each base sigla has a name, normally related with daily objects, but this sigla-object association occurred at a later date for both, Póvoa de Varzim and the system studied in the Danish region of Funnen. The hourglass of Funnen was drawn in the same way as the chalice of Póvoa de Varzim thus indicating that both are remnants of a later era.

""There are no Eurobonds that Conte wanted, but there is the ESM, a dramatic mortgage on our children's future, work and savings"". Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, comments on the agreement reached by the Eurogroup on the measures to be taken to deal with the coronavirus emergency.

""Since 1989 to date, Italy has paid Europe 140 billion, now to borrow 35 billion, we are putting ourselves in the hands of a legalized system of bottlenecks. Moreover, without any passage in Parliament, as repeatedly requested by the League. We are outside the law, we are in dictatorship in the name of the virus. We will present a motion of no confidence to Minister Gualtieri. P.S. If the Dutch government celebrates, it means it is a second Caporetto,' he adds.

Short answer: Federalism in Germany. 

Long answer: The german army has something called the *Bundesamt für Ausrüstung, Informationstechnik und Nutzung der Bundeswehr* which is basically the guys who are responsible for aquiring weapons and other material for the Bundeswehr. Now thanks to german federalism, in which nearly all administrative tasks are done by the states, no institution that is even remotly as big exists for any other federal ministry. On state level sure, but the Federal state wants to keep an eye on their expenses. So now that the federal health ministry needs all kinds of stuff, they use the BAAINBw to aquire medical material in crisis.

They won't break the EU. They refuse to go further in the French experiment of one European Nation until the underlying fiscal issues are fixed.

In 1999 France got what they wanted and allowed the German unification is they would get a common currency. Kohl in its turn wanted Italy (who was already sick) dragged in.

The Netherlands never wanted that and still refuses to pursue further integration unless the rules of the European Stability Mechanism are implemented by all the countries. The Dutch nightmare is a EU transfer union.

You do realize the only way to really fix that is a cashless Union where all payments are made through cards and apps, is the EU ready to do that? If yes, then the problem is solved. Unfortunately there are no plans in sight that goes in that direction so the tax evasion problem can't be eliminated. Italy has tried so hard to tackle the problem with lots of measures but most of it is impossible to recover no matter what measures are implemented. Only a complete cashless Union with traceable payments can fix the problem. 

The interest on the debt would not be a problem if only we had a real central bank instead of a puppet. Market speculation shouldn't derail a country's effort. And speculation arises from the inactivity of the Central Bank.

3241,"&gt;Okay what the fuck I checked my sources and turns out it was sensationalized bullshit.

Honestly you're a big man for admitting this. I was in part assuming it was at least in part based on the Lubach piece and admittedly he's usually a pretty reliable source and most of the reporting he relies on tends to be pretty good. This particular piece really wasn't. ([This guy](https://twitter.com/erikhormes/status/1247060401214414848) had a pretty good Twitter thread about it)

&gt;So regarding Trade deficits, what  you're basically saying is that we need to help Italy at all costs,  since that would heavily impact our economy if we wouldn't, or if you  wanted to put it a bit more sensationalized that we 'have ourselves to  blame for being dependant on other countries'. Did I interpret that  correctly? If so then I don't think it's not neccessarily relevant,  since that's obvious, and it's already a given that we want to help.  Just not in the way Italy wants; Eurobonds.

My point is kind of that we can't have our cake and eat it too: we can't be in a single market area and currency zone without common fiscal policy. We can't benefit from our trade surplus without having to pay some form of compensation for it. Now there are some mechanisms to deal with this structural problem and I would advocate for a European Monetary Fund that countries with a trade surplus pay into, and invests in countries with a trade deficit. It's under common management so not a single country benefits too much from it. (It is based on Keynes' original proposal for the IMF during the Bretton Woods Conference of '44)

It's pretty unlikely this will happen and thus mostly an academic exercise. But another more realistic but still pretty damn unlikely scenario is something along the lines of the [London Debt Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Agreement_on_German_External_Debts):  This agreement cancelled much of West-Germany's public debt after the Second World War. It freed up Germany to become the industrial machine we know today. Apart from cancelling a part of its debt, the other part Germany didn't need to repay as long as it had a trade deficit which gave other country's an incentive to buy German goods.

So there are some out of the box options you can think up (or as I did less creatively, rob them from the past experiments by New Deal Liberals).

 

&gt;I don't understand enough about the  last one to agree or disagree with it right now, but by budget cuts you  mean 'bezuinigingen', right? Why would it not be possible for Italy to  do that, and why, if really impossible right now, is it not possible to  delay that by a certain amount of time before they need to make those  cuts? Didn't we make cuts during the previous economic crisis? Or do you  argue that those cuts were too destructive compared to the benefits  they provided?

Yes budget cuts would be bezuinigingen. During a crisis like this Italy's debt is inevitably going to shoot up: like the Netherlands Italy will have to do extra spending to prop up businesses to keep them from going bankrupt, at the same time there is going to be less tax revenue as people and businesses are earning less and there is less spending. They are going to have to borrow money on the bond markets but as the situation in Italy is very precarious those bond markets charge the Italian government high interest rates, which means they have even less to spend (hence Eurobonds).

The Dutch government wants Italy to do spending cuts. And spending cuts are bad for economic growth: it means less subsidies for business, it means civil servants making less wages or even being fired. Those businesses and civil servants aren't spending either. It's how you end up in an austerity trap: the economy is in a recession, tax revenue decreases, you cut spending, the economy gets even worse.

The ideological justification within the Dutch government is that Italian spending cuts will clean up the governments finances and inspire confidence in private investors who will then start pumping private capital into the economy, while interest rates for Italian bonds will drop. In reality this tactic was tried by Hoover and Colijn during the Great Depression and by Greece over the past decade. It doesn't work. (This is very much Austrian School versus Keynesian Economics, or supply-side versus demand-side economics).

The Dutch government itself mostly cut spending during times when the economy was growing slightly, it didn't do this during the height of the 08-09 crisis for example when it did spend pretty large deficits to prop up the Dutch economy.",,/r/europe/comments/fxof6x/revealed_netherlands_blocking_eus_covid19/fmx8k7p/,Eendracht,1586460419

no, an argument to say taxing companies cost jobs would be me saying you should tax companies or they'll have less employees.


my point is that regardless of how much tax a coporation pays, they primarily contribute to society by giving people employment


&gt;yeah, no kidding! Tax havens absolutely benefit from being tax havens, I'm not disputing that. I'm saying all the countries that aren't tax havens get screwed by those that are.

so what if other countries get screwed? it's called being competitive, a country should be able to decide how competitive they want to be, especially when they can't even devalue their own currency (the euro of course) and if they had the same corp tax as everyone else, the corp taxes would go to the countries that already have good economies.


for some countries, being  a tax haven is one of it's few means of raising revenue, but even if that country was rich they should get to decide how competitive they want to be with tax.


I mean imagine how ridiculous it would be if goods had a minimum price so that other businesses wouldn't be undercut as much.

Italy's GDP is \~€2T and its debt-to-GDP ratio is \~135%. According to the article, Italy loses €1.5B a year in lost tax revenue to The Netherlands, which is less than 0.1% of its GDP (and an even lower percentage of its debt). Linking The Netherlands' status as a tax haven (as a Dutch person myself I don't deny this, and am happy measures are being taken to change this) to Italy's high debt and subsequent high interest rates compared to other countries is totally unsubstantiated. In fact, [this article](https://fee.org/articles/italy-s-taxes-drive-its-economy-underground/) shows that Italy misses out on €150B in tax revenue due its domestic shadow economy, which accounts for a staggering 21% of its GDP. Furthermore, according to [this article](https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/government-debt-to-gdp) the last time Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio was below 100% was in 1991, and it's been relatively stable at around 134-135% since 2015 after a steady increase since the mid 2000s.

The Dutch people absolutely feel for the plight of Italy, but surely it is understandable that unconditional mutualizing of debt is not fair either? Also, realistically, Italy needs financial help now, and there are other methods that will help faster than debating about eurobonds, which have all kinds of legislative issues that need to be dealt with first.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/fxof6x/revealed_netherlands_blocking_eus_covid19/fmwuhfu/,EduardH,1586453251

So if that is the situation in say 2 years, and the issueing of coronabonds stops, will Italy still be able to roll over it's national debt at acceptable interest rates? Or will international investors still look at the economy of Italy, it's effective debt burden and interest burden and say, well, maybe not at these rates. Maybe just at rates that Italy really can't afford?

Germany is a huge beneficiary on virtue of actually producing good shit and selling it abroad.

Germany isn't where it is because of the Euro, Germany is where it is because of the two tunnel machine manufacturers, one sits in Germany.

3391,"Ministers of the Eurogroup have to decide today on financial support for countries severely affected by the coronavirus. There needs to be an emergency package for citizens, businesses and countries. The political tension lies in the question of which instruments should be included in that package.

Italy would prefer common European government bonds (Eurobonds), while the Netherlands and eight other countries would like to make the pot of money from the ESM (European Stability Mechanism) emergency fund available under certain conditions.

**Italy wants Eurobonds**

Early yesterday morning, after a 16-hour marathon meeting, the negotiations stalled because the Netherlands on the one hand and Italy on the other were not prepared to give up.

European government bonds are useful for Italy, the Italian Minister of Finance argued during the meeting, because his country needs a lot of money to get the economy back on track after the crisis.

The Netherlands, like Germany and Austria, is resisting because our country is partly paying for the poorly functioning Italian economy. ""Eurobonds were bad, are bad and will always be bad"", says Austrian Finance Minister Blümel. ""The Netherlands is not alone in its opposition to the Eurobonds,"" he says prior to the new round of meetings. ""That picture of eighteen to one is wrong.""

**'We're not giving anything away.'**

Italy has a strong focus on European government loans and has less interest in the pot of money from the ESM, diplomats say. The group of countries around the Netherlands is prepared to make part of that pot (over 400 billion euros) available, especially for medical matters. ""That has to be well justified afterwards, we don't just give something away"", says Blümel.

About the rest of the money, meant to help the badly affected countries to restart their economy, he is just as hard as Hoekstra. ""If you haven't done your homework in sunny times, you shouldn't be shouting murder and fire and demanding solidarity now.""

Despite all the criticism of Hoekstra's actions - France called it a disgrace, Germany described it as inappropriate and not purposeful - he maintains his position that borrowing is allowed, but that the usual conditions apply. So not only repay neatly, but also put the budget in order. Or as the Austrian minister put it: ""You can't use the crisis as a cover to solve old problems"".

The Eurogroup meeting starts at 6pm.

3507,"Translation:

&gt;The southern countries have been hit particularly hard by the corona crisis, which is why an unprecedented aid package is needed. The flight in national like-mindedness threatens the survival of the European Union, argues European Commissioner Frans Timmermans.  
&gt;  
&gt;A lot has been written in the past week about the lack of understanding of the Netherlands in enlightened self-interest. Economists and others rightly point out that preventing a social and economic collapse of southern Europe is in the direct interest of the export-driven Dutch economy. It is obvious and good that it is explicitly pointed out. And at the same time, it's also sad that it's necessary. Certainly, in any form of solidarity there is a kernel of enlightened self-interest, but it should say that we are not letting anyone in the European Union suffer a social and economic apocalypse.  
&gt;  
&gt;The measures needed to control the virus and then control the crisis and promote recovery can be compared in size and cost with nothing in our collective European post-war experience. Estimates vary, but it is not unreasonable to assume that in order for the economy to get back on track, investment will be needed that will add up 10% of the GDP of all Member States. That's over one and a half trillion euros. This is not the way with in the existing rules. The sooner countries are honest about this, the sooner we find common solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Double bad luck  
&gt;  
&gt;This is called a symmetrical crisis, because the virus does not discriminate and affects everyone. However, the effects of the crisis are not symmetrical, because not everyone is hit equally hard and not everyone has an equally strong base to fall back on. The south of our continent is doubly unlucky in this respect: extra badly affected and the least recovered from the financial and economic crisis that has raged since 2008. Also the hardest hit in the 2015 refugee crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;Awareness must grow very quickly that we face an unprecedented challenge. Reflexes from the credit crisis or the refugee crisis must be overcome, because they can now only be crippling. The need for solidarity must permeate everyone, solidarity, which goes far beyond helping to alleviate the immediate medical need.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is why, in a few first steps, the European Commission has suspended the rules on budgetary discipline and state aid in force, freed up more money that can go directly to Member States in need and launched a plan to support people who are (at risk of) losing their jobs. Furthermore, the Commission, together with the European Council, will present a plan at the request of the Member States to promote recovery while at the same time making our society more resilient through modernisation and sustainability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Strongest shoulders  
&gt;  
&gt;The costs involved will, as indicated, be very high. This calls for new instruments, showing that the strongest shoulders bear the heaviest burden in Europe too. Moreover, the resources that we as Europeans could collectively mobilise can be earmarked for investment in the future and not to pay off old debts. The total cost will be much lower if this is done collectively than if Member States start working for themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;In any case, the ability of European leaders and institutions to find a credible response to the challenges of the corona crisis in the short term will largely determine whether Europeans in all Member States still believe in the principles on which European cooperation is based.  
&gt;  
&gt;In any case, the flight in national like-mindedness and finger-pointing at each other will not solve anything and will, for many, prove the impotence of current political leaders and the systems for which they stand. It seems obvious to me that the EU, as we know it, will not survive. The fact that national democracies would also suffer very serious damage is obvious. There's a lot at stake. Tackle, so.

If you don't think that his gaffes ALONE are already a qualifier for being one of the lesser candidates, I don't know what else to tell you. That, combined with his rather lacklustre policies, bad voting history, various smears that Trump can use, even rape/sexual misconduct allegations... I don't see how he's going to excite voters. The media covered him greatly, he got massive support from endorsements, that made the momentum swing his way, but... looking at his actual policies, his history and his present performance in terms of public appearances, I don't see him winning.

I think there's ample chance for Trump to attack him and a decent chance that Biden won't always be able to respond properly. Add to that that I see an awful lot of progressives that are angry about how Bernie was treated saying they won't vote for Biden (even saw multiple claiming they'd vote for Trump over Biden because at least he's not pro-war), which also doesn't bode well for his progressive support. The way things went generated anger among progressives and their voting behaviour is going to be iffy. 

Most candidates had more exciting policies, better histories and were better and more energetic speakers. So yeah Biden was one of the worst of them.

The only country I've insulted here is Spain because their governments reaction to what was obvious was so blasé that it caused their infection rate to severely spike in a preventable manner.

Italy was the first European and the second (realistically) global country to face this crisis. Within that statement are a lot of loaded things; the first nation was China, which has an authoritarian regime in charge, therefore, hearing about Chinese lockdowns is not strange; the EU cannot compete with that, and cannot implement the same lockdown policy in nearly as quick of a time because we have freedoms. Italy was also extremely unlucky in _where_ it hit - an area with an aged population, and it got in to a hospital very quickly. Italy was following the lead of China as best as they could, but they were constrained by the things they could not do, so trying to find the proper process in a fast time. Based on all of the above, the Italian response was actually extremely respectable, and the other European countries, including both of mine (live in NL, but I am from England) should actually be ridiculously thankful to Italy for showing us the way and allowing us to know what works and what does not.

3580,"&gt; Its political system has been dysfunctional for a long time.

This is a structural problem that cannot be changed without remaking the constitution.

&gt;The second reason that made this Constitution truly impassable and harmful to the regime that was to be born of it was that our constituents started from the opposite point of view to the one from which the German constituents would start when Germany was free to draft its own Constitution. What did the German constituents start from? From this reasoning: Nazism was the fruit of the Weimar Republic. What was the Weimar Republic? It was the powerlessness of the executive power, that is, the government. [...] Germany remained in disorder, in chaos, in the Babel of parties that could never find stable majorities, therefore effective governments. That's why Hitler won, why Nazism won. Our constituents started from the opposite assumption, that is, they said: ""What was fascism? Fascism was the prize given to an executive power that ruled without parties, without controls and so on. So we must completely deprive the executive power, [denying] the possibility of giving governments stability, etc."". To do what again? Weimar. That is, while the Germans were starting from Weimar's denial, we arrived [in Weimar] without saying so. Nobody said it, but this was the result. [...] It wasn't even possible to introduce the usual line of barrage that was introduced in Germany, so that the parties that didn't reach 5 or 3 percent were not entitled to representation. No, all the parties had to be there and all had the power to blackmail the majorities, which were necessarily coalitions.

For businesses, there are many loopholes. It is so by design, to attract companies relocating. This is the bad part that should be removed. 

When I talked with a tax consultant, considering moving profit from IP of a company I was representing, I was offered packages for incorporating and moving the IP to Zug (Switzerland), Ireland, Cyprus and the Netherlands. All these options offered paying much smaller profit and dividend taxes compared to another EU country where the company was registered. 

In the end, profits weren't large enough to warrant the move, but generally the more money you make, the easier it is to move to another jurisdiction. All these programs are basically soft tax havens, which allow a company to deny tax revenue to its home country, while maintaining respectability and access to banking services that having an EU address offers.

It's a well oiled machine. And the EU's new Tax Directive is doing good things to make it harder (less attractive) to move your money to hard tax havens (Panama, Anguilla, the Caymans, ...), but it's necessary also to get rid of EU countries poaching each other's tax revenue through carefully crafted ""entrepreneurship incentives"".",,/r/europe/comments/fxp1nz/die_welt_in_italy_the_mafia_is_just_waiting_for_a/fmvugfm/,-martinique-,1586431306

3646,"&gt; Italy has been lending money for years and just increasing their debt.

No. They have been consistently reducing their debt from 1994 to 2008, at which point the banking crisis happened and the governments had to clean up the mess the professional money managers made with their banks. This obviously meant a swift increase in debt like most other EU countries, especially since the ECB was forced to have a masochistic no-money-creation policy by the austerity maniacs until they were forced to acknowledge reality and finally allowed the ECB to do its job two years later. It still caused rising interest and a debt snowball during those two years. Then Italy has suffered from the happenstance of being a major arrival destination of refugees, but despite that they kept their debt levels stable from 2014 onwards.

3648,"As for his ""incompatibility with the ECR's raison-d’être"", I guess this fragment is relevant:

&gt;“To me, in a worldwide tragedy such as this … under special circumstances, there had to be ways to flank 'bottom up' research with programs that can be helpful in the more immediate timeframe,” he said. 

Additionally, these fragments from [the ERC's statement](https://erc.europa.eu/news/resignation-mauro-ferrari-–-statement-scientific-council) suggests to me a certain, I don't know, inflexibility and perhaps overzealous restraint in the pro-activity of their actions?

&gt;To address this point specifically, we did not support a special initiative because that is not our remit and the Commission's Research and Innovation Directorate General, with which we are connected, was already very active in developing new programmes to support this research through the appropriate channels.

and

&gt;However, the ERC does not make calls for specific topics, since a guiding principle of ERC is that our researchers are free to pursue the goals they define and to decide on what they wish to work.

The latter of which strikes me as odd - they mustn't ask grantees to take up COVID research, because that's their principle (regardless of the fact that, as the statement indicates elsewhere, they had already been approached independently by researchers inquiring about COVID funding)? Sounds very by the book, perhaps a bit too much, in a time of crisis, so I can understand Ferrari's apparent frustrations.

As for his physical absence, the Politico article states (emphasis mine):

&gt;He also described any suggestion he had spent excessive time in the United States as “really malicious.”

&gt;Ferrari said that during the past month, when he has been in the U.S., he spent eight days quarantined in a hotel room in Denver after becoming ill. After being visited by an ambulance and the police, Ferrari said he was asked to get tested for the coronavirus[.] [...]

&gt;[...]

&gt;He said he has kept European working hours and that his arrangements had been fully documented with the ERC, **while observing that the EU institutions were all currently working from home. “How does it matter to anybody if I’m telecommuting from here or there**. [...]

The ECB spent 2.6 trillion on its equivalent program.

&gt;The EU enforced austerity

Firstly, if you don't have enough money to pay for the thing you want that's not 'austerity'. That's just not having enough money. So you're saying it would have been better for Spain if they either a) devalued their currency or b) significantly increased their debt. Which means ...

Secondly Spain is better placed to face the corona virus because of austerity. The cost of buying equipment isn't 10X what it would be under devaluation and you're not crippled with debt.

&gt; But, somehow, austerity in the middle of an economic crisis works, contrary to the advice of most experts.

Yes, but this is the point that 'horrible dutch finance minister' was making. The last 10 years were the 'good years' of growth. If you're maxing out your safe levels of debt during the good years then you don't have a buffer during the bad years.

&gt;USA ... barely noticed the crisis.

On a macro-economic level their economy recovered faster because they have no social protections. Either you are productive or on the street. A spanish austerity looks pretty nice to a healthy US economy to a lot of americans.

Not saying these things to be anti-spanish. I hope Spain/Italy find the key to unlocking their economies, but it seems clear to me that more loans for Spain would not be spent on capital investment.

3672,"DiniMere gave a good answer on trying to crack down on it.

But I will explain the tax haven status of the Netherlands a bit more.

The Netherlands is the country with the most tax treaties with other countries in the world. These tax treaties cover a lot of different sections of tax law but the most interesting treaties for these companies are the treaties to prevent double taxation.

Double taxation means that you get taxed in the country that make your money in and get taxed again when you move the money out of the country. 

The Netherlands has a lot of treaties with countries that cancelled this tax when moving money out of a country.

The problem here is that a companies, in some cases, companies dont pay tax in the country they get their revenue in. They move a lot of expenses to that country and their profit is zero.  If you have zero profit you dont pay taxes. Then they move the money from this country to the Netherlands, they dont pay tax for this because they use the tax treaties.

So in general they pay little or no tax this way. 

The Netherlands and OECD has been trying to combat this way of avoiding taxes by fair transfer pricing, so you cannot artificially move expenses around to get your profit down.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/fxof6x/revealed_netherlands_blocking_eus_covid19/fmvuuqv/,Dododream,1586431701

That would mean that even for small local companies(not cross-border or multinationals) in our country, their corporate taxes would go from 19 to 25 percent. Or why he wants that companies that make a profit during this corona crisis, would have to pay 50 to 75 % tax over those profits.

The Netherlands' tax structure for global companies is despicable. It's well-known that our prime minister and his VVD-cronies love lubing themselves up for companies like Shell and Unilever. This is known and this is, again, despicable.

However, and here I will start being sarcastic, it is *also* well-known that Rutte holds a gun to those global corporations *and* artists like Mick Jagger, Bono and the late David Bowie *forcing* them to avoid taxes in other countries. It's not, y'know, morally reprehensible that these global entities *choose* to avoid taxes.

Alright, so far the snark. Let's continue battling the propaganda in the headline.

The Dutch government is blocking Eurobonds, not *the* recovery plan. It's politically impossible to accept Eurobonds. We've had a decade plus of austerity. The Dutch government has consistently made the choice of using budget surplus to pay off the national debt at the cost of the national welfare state. National welfare has bled on the altar of 'fiscal responsibility'. Now we have to throw that out of the window to ""rescue"" states that haven't been fiscally responsible?

To close: The narrative of the mean, evil, unsympathetic Dutch kinda forgets that the Netherlands is also in the grip of Corona. Hundreds of thousands are either formally or informally fired. Entire sectors of the economy are in an artificial coma, bleeding into death.

It's not like our economy isn't going to need a fucking recovery after Corona.

But hey, apparently everything here is fine and dandy, and we just hate the Southern States.

Apologies for that last line of sarcasm. I couldn't resist.

Fuck this headline and fuck the divide. 

And last but not least: Fuck Eurobonds.

3932,"&gt;Germany and other countries love a monetary union with all the benefits and none of the requirements but and love to talk about liability. Which liability the one where you don’t inact fiscal transfer necessary for a monetary Union to work?

It's a common misconception.

No, countries don't benefit from being ""too cheap"". You don't benefit from accepting a lower salary from a different company for the same, so why should a country do the same?

Being too cheap leads to lower salaries, which is a particularly bad problem with highly skilled workers. Germany (like other countries) experiences a brain-drain at the very top of the highly skilled market. They are losing workers to the USA, Switzerland, Dubai etc.

People don't like to accept this, but a small minority of highly skilled workers lead to massive amounts of productivity and progress in a country. Those are the people you need to get your country ahead.

Only in the low-wage sectors do you find more low-skilled jobs. This is usually in the services industry. Which is not particularly relevant to the export market. Low-skilled jobs are low quality economic growth and not as desirable (compared to high-skilled jobs), yet better than nothing.

In turn, this reduces GDP and growth prospects now and in the future. Germany's growth is much below would it should have been at appropriate prices.

3956,"&gt;This is just immigration, most aren't even from Syria and Syria itself is stable in most of the country now days. There are only a few remaining pockets not under government control.

Then deport those without a valid asylum claim - what's the issue?

&gt;Taxes are clear in their amounts and you can control how much you are taxed via voting because some parties advocate less taxes, more on certain people and so on.

And asylum seeker redistribution allows to control how many asylum seekers countries can efficiently house, feed and care for.

&gt;They also break down when there is no control on entry, when borders break down and when there is widespread abuse of the process as well as a lack of deportation of failed applications.

Sure, I am not disputing that lol, then let's have a joint European border guard and a joint European asylum programme, and invest heavily more into civil servants that deal with asylum claims. The backlog that exists for deportations is not because of magic or unicorns - it's a bureaucratic bottleneck.

&gt;Yeah so why sign up for that burden with no upper limit and no plan to stop the inflow.

Because these are universally - internationally - valuable programmes? Everyone can become an aslyum seeker - I've met *American* refugees here in Latvia, who have fled due to various issues in their home country. Latvians fled our country en masse during WW2. Even in Britain during the Blitz children from London were sent as refugees to outlying communities. You can't ''stop the inflow'' of asylum seekers, unless you have a world government that stops our pointless wars and curbstomps authoritarian militarist dictators that repress their peoples. Again - this is a right that we all ''enjoy'', and at least for me the idea that if war comes to Latvia I can get the fuck out of here with my family is what helps me sleep at night. ''No upper limit'' means nothing as the upper limit is determined by the crisis at hand - that's why I said that these are burdens, not benefits. No one benefits from war and from refugees, my dude. But that does not mean we should act as if we couldn't be in the same boat.

4107,"FYI, a lot of people in the Netherlands don't agree with our tax haven. Your average person doesn't really even benefit of it(Except that it being a tax havens helps the economy, but the extent to which it does is gravely overestimated.) It's just that it's not so easy to change that while the power rests in the hands of political parties. 

Now that will probably beg for another question: Why allow these parties to rule all the time? That's not a straightforward answer, but if needed i could explain one of the big contibutors to that reason.

The tax evasion stuff from Italy makes them bite themselves in their own foot. Of course we need solidarity. But if you stay rational, is it really weird that some countries are not willing to share debt in eurobonds with a country that fails to collect the taxes of their own citizens? 

It's not meant as a jab, it's not saying anything shit about Italians as people in general, it's just the way it is. Yet the Netherlands(and don't forget, also other countries) not agreeing on Eurobonds is seen as an attack on the character of Southern European people themselves, which causes retaliation.
While in fact most of us Dutchies don't think ill of southern Europeans at all, in fact most have positive things to say. Unless your name is  Jeroen Dijsselbloem of course, who a couple of years ago said that southern Europeans should stop wasting their money on booze and hookers. A comment that's vile and i'm sure it's something that southern Europeans didn't forget, thus the strong reaction to us Dutch people. Hating on an entire country for the actions of a few doesn't make it fair though. I don't call Italians thiefs because of the tax evasion.

TLDR: People need to stop generalising. In the end, most people all over the world are just average joes trying to survive in this world. Yet when shit hits the fan, people start looking outward a lot more, and with that comes a lot of blind rage from all sides. I have sadly also seen some of my countrymen say some shitty things.

Other than that, and in a very general way, no, Eurovision is a bubble and a small one at that, with its music not being the best representative type of mainstream music in each country.

More than half the countries have specific competitions - mini-Eurovisions, if you will - where they pick the artist and the song, and those are usually either newbie performers trying to make a name for themselves and getting exposure or B or C listers in the general music scene, trying to get more popular or reviving their careers.

And that's just talking about the performers, if we delve into the composers, that bubble is even smaller, with the same people writing and producing for multiple countries in any given year.

There are exceptions, like Sweden, for instance, where Eurovision is pretty much Christmas for them, and also - it should be said - in the last 5 or so years there has been a general tendency for every country to try to get more popular artists into Eurovision as well as a a general effort into the production of the Eurovision acts, resulting in better songs. The Big 5, for instance, apart from France, all upped their game this year, even the UK (the issue there being that the standard was so poor, that even [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iS-lV909T4) is a major step-up in what they've doing in Eurovision).",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/fx9fbt/eurovision_2020_grand_final_result_based_on/fmuc0f8/,odajoana,1586388437

The current policy with renewables is really quite the cluster fuck and failure of a policy. It makes the production, and thus the price of electricity sporadic and pretty much kills all investment on that new production, unless you get some form of guarantees, or unless you have something like your own industrial operation going on that you can use the electricity at steady rate, and then convert to selling electricity to grid, when the price is high.

4255,"Dutch perspective: Rules were agreed in the EU to lower debt to 60% of GDP, this was done between 2010 and 2020. On top of that the debt was further reduced to around 50% of GDP. Typical bad results of austerity are unemployment which is currently at 3.4%, low GDP growth which has been around 3% the past years. In Italy the debt has grown from 100% in 2008 to 134% in 2018. This in itself is fine, no issues every country has their own policies and political direction their going in. Unfortunately the inevitable happened since at some point an economic crisis is deemed to happen. The Dutch government borrows money and raises its debt % in order to keep the economy going and relieve the pressure from immediate effects of the ongoing situation. 

Italy now wants Eurobonds where all EU countries underwrite debts so they can have lower interest rates or money from the ESM without any conditions. 

For me personally this seems to be an issue with solidarity vs sovereignty, if there would have been good economic policy in Italy the past 10 years the current situation would be easier (not easy by any means) to deal with and there would be more goodwill from other (northern) EU countries.

Actually in Germany there is a part of the voters that welcome eurobond, even many economists said they support it. Recently the ex PM Schröder said the same.

The Green Party also said eurobond would be in Germany's interest. The public opinion is divided about the matter.

Will they do it? At the moment no because of Constitutional issues and other problems but I wouldn't count them out. Especially if some strict conditions are listed for eurobond uses.

Moreover there were voices that France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxemburg, Greece, Slovenia and other countries could create their own fund and then corner the other States. Germany in that case will follow to show leadership especially if conditions are listed for eurobond joint issuing.

If Germany joins, the position of the Netherland will collapse entirely and it would be a huge fiasco. If they don't join at that point they will be completely isolated and with strained relationship with the vast majority of the EU. A suicidal position. And even if they then decide to joins the relationship with other EU states would still be bad since nobody forget their staunch position and lack of solidarity.

There are these things called economic and monetary unions. Theoretically, outside a country they only work with countries with very similar economic and institutional situations (same economic level, tax rules, etc.).

What has happened in the European monetary union is that countries with very different levels of development have joined.

In the past, whenever Portugal/Spain/Greece/Italy imported too much and exported little, it devalued their currency, creating a barrier to it. Vice versa in countries that had a competitive advantage (the German mark rose and made exports more expensive and imports from the periphery cheaper). Countries like Germany and the Netherlands were left with an artificially low currency. Furthermore, with the freedom of movement of people and capital, they attract the most qualified human resources and the most productive investments (which is noticible).

The only way to counter this (see USA Federation) is with € transfers and a common social security (for example Alabama versus California) or through a real devaluation (labor costs), making Portugal or Greece more attractive because they have cheap labour or to have a true monetary union (as in the USA - if you have a Central Bank you also have common bonds, yes? - both are tied - because if they are not, capital will always prefer to invest in the countries that started with the best position, hence less risk).

In economic terms there is very little that the Portuguese or Greek or Spanish government can do without a real economic and fiscal union, mainly because there is a trap of productive specialization (southern productivity is low not because we work too little (we work way more hours than northen countries) or badly, but because we produce things that have low added value). We export car parts with a very thin industrial margin, and import cars and high value technology from germany and other countries. The only solutions for this problems are linked with better education and changing to more value intensive businesses (both of whcih take decades) - but again although we've been doing this, our human capital flees to german, etc. Finnaly, this type of solution requirements investment and these countries don't have enough money.. and don't talk about benefits (which we cut like hell) or retirement age (which is now 67). Also, look at data for government spending over GDP (portugal for instance is below Germany and well below EU average).

Ignoring all of this is intellectual dishonesty that some like to do with completely wrong moral lessons.

As for debt high debts. Of course the debt is still extremely high, since we incur in higher yields and our gdp is smaller and we neened money to face the 2008 crisis. And debts don't pay themselves and as I've stated originally you can not deflate (not a good solution) the debt as you would with your own currency...and again if you have had your own currency debt wouldn't even reach that amount. 

Again , common currency favours those that are more competitive to begin with and creates wrong incentives to other countries.Banks from more competitive states lend money to peripheric countries (searching for higher yields) and that money fuels the purchase of products and services from Central countries. So , the moneterian union not only favours the purchase of foreign high value goods (that are artificially low) but it also leads to financial gains for foreign institutions.

But then you want these countries to make conter cyclical policies (using the ESM) that would destroy their economy like they did with Greece.. which was already condemned by this fucking monetary union trap. And some of you always use this moral high horse of ""we won't pay your debts"". Well, you know you should pool debt because this great inbalance favours you.

Solution is not easy, but a monetary union can only work with a common fiscal policy (the same people that are against eurbonds are against an increase in the EU budget), a bannking union and of course a pooled debt. Other paths are abandoning this union (which I think is wrong because europe is the last hope of progressive thinking in the world, and alone not even germany can deal with the USA, China and Russia).. nevertheless, populism and nationalism took over the world and I don't have huge hopes.",,/r/europe/comments/fx8gzw/netherlands_blocking_decision_on_esm_is/fmtyu4h/,vgasmo,1586381444

DEEPL translation:

Eurogroup in deadlock over emergency package, also German minister now criticizes Wopke Hoekstra

The European finance ministers did not reach agreement on new support measures against the corona crisis after a video meeting lasting 16 hours. 

The biggest stumbling block was the deployment of 240 billion euros from the European emergency fund, to which the Dutch Minister Hoekstra, against the wishes of his colleagues, wants to attach conditions.

Eurogroup chairman Centeno will make another attempt on Thursday. He wants to map out an aid package of more than 500 billion euros. The stranded marathon meeting of the ministers means that the planned video summit of the heads of government later this week is almost certain to take place. EU officials see it as a scratch on the image of the EU that even during the pandemic, ministers are not prepared to jump over their shadows.

Centeno was still hopeful about an agreement at the start of the meeting. He talked about the 'biggest and most ambitious package ever' that ministers would sign. As expected, Minister Hoekstra soon turned out to be diametrically opposed to his southern colleagues. 

The diplomats involved described Hoekstra - not for the first time - as 'the hardest of the bunch'. The German minister Scholz was considerably more flexible. Hoekstra was severely criticised by his colleagues after the marathon meeting.  

Point of contention ESM

The meeting of the ministers was suspended again and again for consultation (by telephone) in a smaller context. The main bone of contention was the use of credit from the European Emergency Fund (ESM). Italy, Spain, France and Portugal want to make the available EUR 240 billion available unconditionally to countries severely affected by the pandemic.

Initially, the Netherlands adhered to the existing rules of the emergency fund, which stipulate that such loans must be accompanied by strict requirements regarding reforms and cutbacks and supervision by the European Commission. During the meeting with his colleagues, Hoekstra showed his willingness to postpone matters: if the credit is used for medical expenses, it can be obtained virtually without conditions. If the money is later also used for economic recovery, there will be heavier demands on the loan. The board of the emergency fund should work out the (not unimportant) details. In the end, this turned out not to be enough to persuade the southern countries to compromise. A decision in the Eurogroup always requires unanimity.

German criticism of Hoekstra

The German minister Scholz spoke of 'inappropriate and pointless' demands of his Dutch colleague, without mentioning them by name. The French minister Le Maire stated that ministers who block an agreement should be ashamed of themselves. Afterwards, Hoekstra said he had 'good hope' that he could reach an agreement with his colleagues on Thursday.

There was agreement on the other parts of the support package. For example, the European Commission's proposal to use 100 billion euros for national unemployment benefit schemes received a cautious green light. In the Commission's plan, the 27 EU countries will have to issue capital guarantees to the tune of EUR 25 billion. With this cover, the Commission will be able to raise EUR 100 billion on the capital market and lend it to those countries that request it to compensate for WW costs and reduced working hours. 

Here, too, Hoekstra was initially obstructive. He fears that the WW measure will become a permanent fund to absorb economic shocks, the Netherlands has always turned against such a 'shock fund'. At Hoekstra's request, the temporariness of the measure was emphasised, although the Commission had assured this from the outset.  

Ministers also agreed to increase the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank (EIB). By increasing EU countries' capital guarantees for the EIB, the EIB will soon be able to mobilise an additional EUR 200 billion in loans for companies in difficulty as a result of the corona pandemic.

Eurobonds

A long and heated discussion arose about far-reaching plans to boost the economies again. France, Spain, Italy and Portugal insisted heavily on research into the joint borrowing of euro area countries (eurobonds, or corona bonds). The Netherlands, Germany, but also Austria are resolutely opposed to this. This debate was 'parked': the heads of government must first speak out on 'innovative financial instruments'. Scholz and Hoekstra made it clear that, as far as they were concerned, this does not include eurobonds.

4425,"to put it bluntly.

northern countries need the southern countries to lower euro value, this ensures that it becomes cheaper for foreigners to invest and trade with them. Even things as tourism come in to play, when you realize room prices in deutsche mark or dutch guilders would be more expensive than in euros. The contineous downward pressure that southern political mismanagement has put on the euro (Spain and Greece have certainly done their part in austerity and recovered beyond imagination) is therefor to the benefit of the northern countries, not only because of helping their economies grow in terms of gdp but also ensuring a healthy pool of unemployed workers (or an army of unemployed to serve the downward pressure on wages -in marxist terms) ready for a job. This further enhances investment climate and is to the benefit even to the southern nations as a part of those benefits are channeled back to southern nations to invest in their infrastructure and vital industries through EU funds. 

The southern nations benefit from the euro through these EU funds as these infrastructural improvements lead to a better investment climate there. They too benefit from the influx of highly trained workers from abroad because of Schengen. Even now as Spain is slowly becoming a net contributor instead of benefactor, there are countless reminders next of cultural sights or little roads of the EU's generosity displayed through beautifully blue placks all over the iberian peninsula. 

We all benefit from the EU in a variety of ways, it is the EU that protects our consumer rights therefor our businesses and it is the EU that invests in our vital industries. The EU CAP had led to a situation where we produce enough food to feed ourself, which is certainly a direct need in times of crises. It has kept us at peace and has led us to explore each others cultures, leading to a situation where for example in Amsterdam you can find all European dishes if you look for them (aside of numerous other dishes from all over the world ofc). We trade with the world as one block, the most powerful economic block of nations in the world, that defines consumer protections not just for us but for the entire globe because of the brussels effect. We spearhead the globe in progressive policies and protections of human rights. 

I guess what I wanted to say is that we all benefit from the EU in various ways. We can get through this. As nationals and as Europeans.

4442,"It's clearly about the way countries want to see how things go and what the EU is.

That Portugal, Spain,Greece and Italy want more economical balance isn't new and somewhat justified considering the Euro pretty much screwed them over (but they really should blame the national parties who knew it was unsustainable but brought them in anyway).

That the Netherlands and Germany object to a transfer union isn't new either. With especially the EU being an economical union for the Netherlands, the understanding here in the Netherlands for most of the people always was to be it an economical union, not a political or transfer union.

That France try to play Napoleon isn't new either - the EU always has been viewed by them as a political union with preferably to them a large French leading role.

The proposal re the Euro bonds/'corona bonds' (for the 28209th time) seemingly ignited this. It's understandable Hoekstra is getting annoyed with his European colleagues, since it seems they attempt to abuse a situation to attempt to get an long-standing and very costly wish of them through. Which the Netherlands always has been opposed to, and has been ridiculed for by the previous Commission (who were a bunch of twats in that regard).

It's understandable Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece want and need a way out, but they went the wrong way about it and instead of what they thought was a discussion point (although they should have known better) they lit a match for TNT.

Add to that the asylum claimants crisis that's still ongoing where the Centre-European countries are blocking any resolution, so at least Greece and Italy can see their load lightened in some other regard, and the majority of asylum claimants probably not being true refugees and especially the mood in the Netherlands is shifting month by month towards blowing up the Euro, if not the EU itself.

Before you say 'Won't hurt' - keep in mind that the Netherlands is one of the founding members of the EEG (predecessor of the EU), one of the biggest net contributors and has a sizeable influence still diplomatically in the EU despite the shit treatment over the years.

If the Netherlands leaves, the remaining net contributors would need to fill the gap. Italy however can't currently due to EU rules regarding budget deficits and EU contributions, Austria could but I doubt they'd be willing to do that, Finland, Sweden and Denmark don't have the finances to really help cover the gap and Ireland's economy size is that fraudelous they wouldn't be possible to pay up.

That leaves France and Germany. Germany already covers the largest part of gap in the EU budget that the UK's exit leaves. I doubt also the successor of Merkel is anyone who wants to cover even more of the EU budget without a substantial increase in influence.

So it'd be either pay up or cut down for France - pay for the gap, or cut down on subsidies France mostly benefits from (agriculture, Strasbourg, etc) to size down the budget.",Gelderland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/fx8gzw/netherlands_blocking_decision_on_esm_is/fmtkk7a/,Seldomseenhere,1586374312

4449,"&gt;The countries they are from won't take them back.

That's not  true for every country. There are countries, like Afghanistan, that already accept back their people. One of the problems is that many of the failed asylum seekers stubbornly refuse to identify themselves in order to block the procedure. There are solutions for this. For example tracking the remittances they send to their home countries for most of them would reveal their immediate family members. There are also many ways to pressure countries that refuse to take back their citizens. To my knowledge nothing has been done in any of the 2 directions.

&gt;You may actually be allowed to do that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Problem, is 1, wouldn't be very humane

Imprisonment should be the last resort, but shouldn't be out of the table. Imagine a person who violates repeatedly a restraining order. That would end with prison time for them and if the violation is considered of high risk for the people who asked for the restraining order, imprisonment could possibly come even after the first violation.

I don't see why immigrants who abuse the asylum system should be exempted from prison terms indefinitely. Anyway, there are many ways to deal with them before reaching to imprisonment.

And in case they are exempted from the enforcement of the law, also native citizens should be excepted too. I don't see why discrimination in this case is acceptable.",,/r/europe/comments/fx1tjn/italy_is_no_longer_a_safe_port_migrants_at_sea/fmtkvee/,TravellingAroundMan,1586374467

You didn't.

This *looks* like keynesianism, but Keynes wrote a century ago. You always spend like normal, splurge out in recovery, then stop splurging out in good times as it's unnecessary and the benefit marginal, you let the GDP growth catch up, and thus reduce the ratio. *that's* ""saving up"", if you do austerity, you lose out on more than you actually save.

&gt;s. Making debt during boom and than making more debt during recession is only fuel for bigger recessions and bigger problems in the future.

If you are referring to 2008, nobody made debt during boom. Spain's in 2008 was 34% of GDP, lower than netherlands and germany, and we had a huge surplus. The use of Austerity starting 2011, caused the recession to lengthen into 2018, instead of recovering around 2013 as we should have. This means that our GDP fell for years, increasing the debt to GDP ratio. Furthermore, unnecessary years of idle workers getting money from social programs increased government expenses even more. 

Italy is different because they fell into a debt trap in the 80s, so they need to refinance their debt or monetize it.",Basque Country (Spain),/r/europe/comments/fx1ita/the_eu_fails_on_its_attempt_to_give_an_european/fmt4yna/,cargocultist94,1586366941

4605,"&gt; I am sure they are indeed talking about that. 

But then why are they asking for coronabonds in the public? That's really counterproductive... Not only wont they get that they are creating a situation for themselves to fail and a situation from there they cant get out of again... that's stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That is true for all politicians everywhere 

Not exactly. In the early 2000s Germany was the ""sick man of Europe"". During this time some politicians pushed trough massive reforms... they were extremely unpopular and the party hasn't recovered from that. They were once the biggest party in the world and are now in the territory of having problems getting enough votes to be part of the Bundestag. This created ultimately the ""era"" Merkel... (Not that she isn't a skilled politician)

The point is there are politician when they see that it's time they do the right thing or at least the necessary thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It is true that internet interactions are biased but I also asked feedback to a couple of friends that used to live in the Netherlands and they more or less confirmed me my impression. 

I'm sorry but once again that's not a good argument and just anecdotal... Just think about that... Let's say a dutch or german would write something along the lines the Italians are all lazy because they know of some cases there that is true... that doesn't make any sense.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The point is that Italy has to spend that money no matter where that is coming from. Coronabond, ESM, regular bonds. Otherwise the risk is for its economy to never recover from this crisis. So, the lower the interest on this money the better. With coronabond would be much lower than regular bonds. Some conditions on ESM might be worst than issueing regular bonds. 

Once again... yes Italy needs help no matter what but Coronabonds as shown multiple times wont happen especially since there is no way out of coronabnods... once issued it's over. That would be officially the start of Eurobonds. Regarding the conditions sure... that's what negotiations are for, improving the conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

4668,"Most of the criticisms of that essay were against the mercantilist economies of the time, which were a bad economic model. Smith even states some services are best provided by the state. For example Smith advocated for universal education, even for adults, which did not exist at the time:

&gt;But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the laboring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless the government takes some pains to prevent it

He was aware keeping people poor and uneducated would ensure they were never politically engaged. He advocated setting up universal public education because of this. It is not a stretch to at least consider he would also support things like universal healthcare once it was actually considered by societies. You have to remember TWON was written in 1776. 

Furthering my point, Smith advocated progressive taxes to fund things like universal education: 

&gt;It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.

He also supported inheritance taxes on estates of wealthy people going to their wealthy children. 

There is a good chance Smith would have supported universal healthcare. He was well aware the free market could not always provide services in the most efficient manner (he also used roads as another example). Universal healthcare was still well over 100 years away from even being considered when he wrote TWON.",,/r/europe/comments/fx11mk/coronavirus_wealthy_russians_hoarding_ventilators/fmsphz1/,mkvgtired,1586359888
4669,"This week the European Commission let Italy off the hook, granting the country extra flexibility – to the tune of 14 billion euros – in its debt reduction targets for 2016.

The extra “flexibility” includes allowances for investments (0.25 per cent of GDP), for the refugees crisis (0.04 per cent of GDP) and for extra security measures (0.06 per cent of GDP). In return the Commission wants a ‘clear and credible commitment’ from Italy that the country will respect its budget targets in 2017.

How did Italy get to this point?

Italian public debt currently stands at 132.7 per cent of GDP – the second highest in Europe after Greece.

In the eighties Italian debt rose by 38 percentage points and by 1990 it had reached 92 per cent of GDP. It then experienced the largest drop in the post- World War II period and rose again after 2007, albeit for different reasons.

The legacy of the eighties

The debt explosion of the 80s is, at least in part, a story of bad management of public finances.

“The influence of political parties (..) has contributed to the widespread inefficiencies, to the proliferation of external technical bodies and to the fragmentation of public administration”, a 1997 OECD country survey explains.

Public expenditure was high also because of “inadequate controls, poor co-ordination among procurement agencies and collusion between suppliers and administration.” But this is just one part of the story.

In the eighties, the Bank of Italy introduced high policy rates- at 19 per cent compared to 7.5 per cent in Germany- as a way of reducing fluctuation in exchange rates ahead of the introduction of the single currency. But they also resulted in very high interest payments on the debt.

Despite the waste in the public finances, Italian government spending excluding interest payments increased less than other major European economies.

But, contrary to other European countries, in Italy the tax increases needed to finance this expenditure were delayed.

The result was a budget that for sixty years was never in surplus and that reached its worst levels -12 per cent of GDP – in the mid-eighties.

Italy finally reached a surplus in its fiscal balance (excluding interest payments) in 1992 thanks to a series of measures of fiscal consolidation. It has remained positive ever since, with the exception of 2009.

What now?

With around 4 per cent of GDP still being spent on paying interest on public debt – that’s double the OECD average and nearly four times what Germany pays – the overall budget is still in deficit.

A reduction in debt-to-GDP ratio is expected by 2017 – this should result in a further shrinking of interest payments, assuming interest rates remain low.

This would leave room for “some tax cuts or growth in non-interest expenditure” as the OECD wrote in its latest country survey, which could be crucial in fostering economic growth.

Economic growth is key

“Economic growth is the way out of the debt trap” explains Lorenzo Codogno, visiting professor at the LSE, chief economist at Micro Advisors and former director general at the Treasury of the Italian Ministry of Finance.

Indeed, the size of the economy is the denominator that inflates the debt-to-GDP ratio in times of falling economic output.

In the period which saw the fastest reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio, real public debt actually increased more rapidly than after the global economic crisis.

But with sluggish economic growth, even milder increases in debt have resulted in a steep rise of the debt-to-GDP ratio.

But fostering growth is difficult

Measures of fiscal consolidation might reduce aggregate demand, and thus impinge on overall economic performance, although this is a controversial issue.

But Mr Codogno argues that “the issue of aggregate demand is much smaller now compared to 2011-2012. Economic growth should be promoted via structural reforms, rather than short term support to demand”.

Current and previous governments have already cut spending and “there are no low-hanging fruits left”. According to Mr Codogno the time has come to reduce public spending by “restructuring the way the government offers its services to citizens”. Reforms of public administration are underway, but “there are still plenty of inefficiencies that could be reduced”.

Italian debt is sustainable

“In the long term Italian public debt is one of the most sustainable in Europe”, argues Mauro Pisu, senior economist at OECD. Along with a series of measures intended to accelerate economic growth, he believes the cut in public spending, particularly on pensions, and a primary surplus among the highest in Europe have ensured this.

But Italy needs to get ready for when interest rates will go back to ‘normal levels’ resulting in higher interest payments and a budget which will be harder to balance.

Promising forecasts on the debt-to GDP ratio indicate that the country is on the right path out of its debt trap. Hopefully it’s also proceeding at the right speed",,/r/europe/comments/fx1ita/the_eu_fails_on_its_attempt_to_give_an_european/fmspi5s/,RealNoisyguy,1586359891

From East to West she stretches, staring,
And romantic tresses fall over
Greek eyes, reminding.

The other laid out at an angle.
The first says Italy where it leans;
This one England where, set afar,
The hand holds the resting face.

Austerity caused recession and stagnation.

Now Italy has still its old debt, but now it isn’t anymore able to grow and pay interests.

This is how the North feels about it: people have been feeling much negative change in their wallets as the governments made huge budget cuts to strengthen the economy. Now finally the economy is pretty strong again, but there is a crisis. Now countries who were advised to follow the North’s example are royally fucked because they didn’t listen to their allies nor the rules and they are asking for aid.

Now you are at this stage, your debt to gdp ratio is close to 1.35 and you haven't experienced any significant growth (&gt;2%) for 20 years straight.

4801,"The thing is The Swedish economy is very sensitive to exports.A lower currency rate benefits the export sector. This is because the goods become cheaper for buyers from other countries. Hence, Swedish goods have become more attractive. Since the entire economy of Sweden is based around exports, and the export sector is benefitting, there is a silver lining and And Unlike the Danish Krona, the Swedish Krona is not really pegged to any external currency Hence, Sweden has full autonomy to manipulate currency prices and is using the same.  The markets are fairly confident that the Swedish bank will not raise interest rates. This is the reason why the Krona continues to slide down. Markets expect the interest rates to remain in the negative territory for quite some time in the foreseeable future. The Swedish central bank is very sensitive to interest rates. Unlike the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank, the Riskenbank does not have multiple objectives. Instead, the stated objective of the Swedish central bank is to keep the inflation as low as possible.And the culture is such that people do not expect the wages to increase too much. This is the reason why they are also opposed to an increase in prices. Last year interest rate drop -0.5% to -0.25% has caused an increase in prices. The  government wants to avoid further increases at all costs. Hence, the rates may remain stable in order to enable the government to meet its inflation target",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/fx48zk/how_eu_members_avoid_joining_eurozone/fms33dq/,Aware_Engineering,1586344959

Studies on coronaviruses are actually sparse compared to most other areas of microbiology. Most coronaviruses are benign like the common cold ones. Occasionally one like sars or mers arises but so far these have not caused pandemics and so funding for their research is limited. The best example of this is the vaccine research for sars being abandoned, much is which is being used for the vaccine for Covid 19 now. 

Saying people have studied coronaviruses for decades is true, but they are now where near as well known about something like common bacterial infections. This is because there isn’t the financial opportunities to research coronaviruses.

4980,"&gt; Kill off the massive workers black market

This is tantamount to say ""you make better economy pls"". First of all, ""killing"" unregulated work is an impossible endeavour; every country has it and it's unreasonable to think you could rid a country of it completely. What you meant is, ""reduce unregulated work"". This is not really austerity though, is it? It requires enormous amount of money, for laws (making laws costs money even before they leave the Parliament, crazy I know), for hiring new police officers, new auditers, new justice clerks, new trials, new procedures, new IT systems. Billions of euro. I thought we were supposed to be thrifty here? Not to mention that one half the country is barely competitive as it is  thanks only to not paying labour taxes. It would raise unemployment through the roof, drive down every wage and trigger a recession, on top of the technical recession you're already having because of the austerity (remember, austerity means cutting public expenses... Repeat after me, **cutting public expenses**). So it would actually grow debt in relation to GDP. Does that mean that it's good that so many people are working in the black? No, of course not. Is a recession a good time to destroy a work market, no matter how illegal from a fiscal point of view it may be? Probably not.

&gt; fight tax evasion (hooray...both are probably the most profitable tasks you could imagine) 

It might come as a surprise, but you don't get instant money when you fight tax evasion. There's trials, you know. I do think we can do more, but since the working hypothesis is that we can't run a deficit, Equitalia can't really bolster its tax cheats fighting capabilities. So we can hazard a guess that they'll do as good as their best year, so around 10 bln € a year. Not bad, not nearly enough to do anything substantial. And let's not forget that thanks to your brilliant hypothesis (austerity + reforms) we would probably get less than a regular year, as austerity reduces economic activity and there's less taxes collected.

&gt;  slash red tape and dismantle bureaucracy where its inefficient (hooray again...all profitable things to do) 

All well and good, and I agree. And yet this still costs money. You can't just fire public workers and call it ""slashing red tape"" you know. Massive overhauls of public and civil codes, internal audits to determine the inefficiencies, incredible resistance from the administrations that stunt progress: all these things cost money, a lot of money. Not to mention a fundamental point that kind of collapses your proposal (if we can call it that): Italy actually needs MORE public workers. While there are regions were the public sector is bloated (Sicily, e.g.), most parts of Italy's administration are actually understaffed and underfunded. Historically, it's the Northern countries that have an enormous public sector as part of their economy, not the Southern, contrary to popular belief.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; invest in education (long term profitability). 

All well and good, sure, but this is the opposite of austerity. This is spending money, not saving it. Not to mention, investing in education and R&amp;D has no immediate return. While the effect is less strong since you're raising public expenses, the effect is still that you're raising the debt to GDP ratio, as these kind of long term reforms have no impact on the most important part of the debt ratio equation, *(r-g)*.

I'm going to come out and say it. Just because you're from an economically well off country, it doesn't mean you have an instinctual or genetic understanding of economics. It seems clear to me that most of the users in this sub, North and South, have no understanding of:

1) What actually is austerity

2) How the bugdet procedure works in the EU

3) How budget laws and government budgets work

4) How do you calculate, even in simple terms, debt ratio to GDP

5) What are the basic relationships between various macroeconomics concepts and how they influence each other, things like inflation, unemployement, consumption, production and so on

5066,"ROME - The epidemic does not shift many votes, at least for now, but it changes the attitude of Italians towards the EU and other foreign countries. The latest ""radar"" Swg of April 6 shows only small variations in party percentages, but signals a sudden ""falling in love"" for China, now preferred to the United States as an ally. Instead, as was to be expected, the judgment on the EU, perceived as deaf to the problems that Italy is experiencing, collapses.

Swg explains: ""The crisis linked to the pandemic also changes the perception of political scenarios at a global level. The empathy due to having been the two realities most affected in the initial phase of the epidemic, but also the mutual aid, produce a remarkable rapprochement of Italians to China, to the point of preferring it as an ally over its historical American partner"".

""On the European level, on the other hand, - underlines the research institute - recent dynamics have strongly damaged the relationship between citizens and European institutions"". But not only that, the epidemic has ""also divided the public opinions of the various member states. Most Italians, as well as the majority of French, support the need for solidarity policies between countries to share the costs of the crisis. In financial terms this translates into agreement with the Eurobonds hypothesis, an instrument which, however, finds the opposition of two thirds of Germans"".

36% of Italians consider China preferable as an international partner, while only 30% choose the USA, Italy's historic ally. In particular, 51% of M5s voters and 45% of those in the PD prefer Beijing to Washington, while 51% of centre-right voters remain loyal to the USA.

75% of Italians, then, ask for ""full solidarity among the European states for the relaunch"", together with 58% of the French. Even 83% of those who live in Italy are in favour of European ""Coronabonds"", while 64% of Germans are against them.

Confidence in the European institutions collapses: the EU as such falls from 42% last September to 27% now, the EU Commission from 41 to 24, and the ECB from 43 to 25. On the contrary, the percentage of those who give a positive opinion on Italian foreign policy increases: from 30% in September to 46% now.

The League remains the top political force in the country with 30.7% (it was 31% on 30 March), followed by the Pd at 20.1% (slightly up from 19.2 a week earlier). M5s dropped slightly, to 14.5% compared to 14.9% on 30 March. Confirmed the good momentum of Fdi at 12% (12.3% seven days earlier), while Forza Italia remains at around 5% (5.2%, almost identical to 5.3% of the previous survey). Italia viva (3,4% compared to 3,3% on 30th March), Azione (2,5% compared to 2,7% the previous survey), Sinistra-Mdp (3,5% in April, 3,3% one week earlier) and Più Europa (2,3% from 2,2% at the end of March) were also stable.

5113,"Well, in my view it depends on what your economy is built on. If you have no safety valve in terms of fiscal policy or economic policy, then any imbalance between for example productivity and wage growth will lead to a sluggish economy and low growth for ages. Devaluation is indeed not a structural solution to anything, it will not help you suddenly achieve good growth by just devalueing year after year. Because prices and wages will rise to compensate and in the end it probably doesn't change much. But it is a safety valve to get the pressure out of the system. If you have poor productivity growth and you find yourself in a position where wages have grown too much, you can use devaluation to just ease it up a little, give yourself a year or two to correct it and hopefully wages won't immediately compensate for the devaluation.",,/r/europe/comments/fwijn3/eurobonds_are_not_the_answer/fmri8uw/,slvk,1586324005

If you have problem with specific countries then mention them instead of blaming the entire north.

&gt;Or we can say that was only Orban to oppose, so you can keep feeling in the right.

They say while posting an article that literally says that Orbin is against it. Hell, it even directly states that northern/central europe are the ones that are going to help

&gt;Monday’s mini-summit between France, Germany, Italy and Malta will later be taken up by other EU states and serve as a model for northern and central European states to also take in asylum-seekers, lifting the migration pressure on the ""frontline"" states of Italy and Greece.

And that doesn't even mention that the future meeting mentioned in your article [already happened and among the nations willing to take refugees was the Netherlands.](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-fails-to-cement-agreement-on-migrants-rescued-at-sea/a-50743383)

I make an argument and write an irrelevant story about its name. The fact that Italy tries it before doesn't mean that it doesn't consider it the best course of action. The world doesn't resolve around a nation, and certainly not netherlands.

Let's start with you, move on to the majority of dutch people in reddit, and settle in opinion articles.

That is much better than a decade of recession thanks to German policies of austerity.

5342,"Yes, this article at the link also mentions an article from ""The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists"", which I wrote about the other day:

---

This is a good article about how COVID19 quite possibly (I say very likely) is an accidental release from a lab:

https://thebulletin.org/2020/03/experts-know-the-new-coronavirus-is-not-a-bioweapon-they-disagree-on-whether-it-could-have-leaked-from-a-research-lab/

One interesting mention is:

&gt; **“In January 2020, a renowned Chinese scientist, Li Ning, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for selling experimental animals to local markets.""** 
---

.

I found some more info about that here:

http://www.ecns.cn/news/sci-tech/2020-02-17/detail-ifztrmvi9821649.shtml

&gt; ""A top academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering earned 10.17 million yuan ($1.46 million) by **illegally selling off lab animals and experimental milk**, according to a report in the Shanghai-based The Paper.""

.

And articles about his sentencing in general are:

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/cloning-scientist-sentenced-to-12-years-in-prison-66966  



---

Regarding that first link at the top, it also mentions:


- “Bat coronaviruses at Wuhan [Center for Disease Control] and Wuhan Institute of Virology routinely were collected and studied at BSL-2, which provides only minimal protections against infection of lab workers.”

- One early study “conducted by the South China University of Technology, [that] concluded that the coronavirus **‘probably’ originated in the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention,” located just 280 meters** from the Hunan Seafood Market often cited as the source of the original outbreak. “The paper was later removed from ResearchGate, a commercial social-networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers,” 

- ""Lab safety has been a problem in China. "" 
---

- ""A safety breach at a Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab is believed to have **caused four suspected SARS cases, including one death, in Beijing in 2004.""** 

- **""A similar accident caused 65 lab workers** of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute to be infected with brucellosis in December 2019,” Huang wrote.

- And US labs have problems too: ""In 2014, the agency revealed that staff had accidently sent live anthrax between laboratories, exposing 84 workers. In an investigation, officials found other mishaps that had occurred in the preceding decade.""

Those are just bits from the article, but the whole article is worth a read:

My 'strawman' is at the root of Syriza's troubles. They effectively sought to unilaterally change the agreed terms of the bailout other EU democracies were giving them. They asked for new terms, the lending countries declined, their electorates did not want to change the terms. The Greek electorate cannot decide what other eurozone countries should do, if a political party within Greece pretends otherwise, they're misleading the electorate. Syriza misled the Greek electorate during their election.

edit: one thing to add, the Greek bailout was an absolute travesty. Most of the involved actors could and should have done better (past Greek governments and electorates first and foremost). The democratic argument is just fundamentally incorrect. If a country wants something from a different country all it can do is ask. It cannot democratically vote for that other country to give it to them. Given the level of popular support for the bailouts in countries like the Netherlands, you could argue it wasn't a shining example of democracy in the North either.

Everyone else understands this lockdown shit is unsustainable and leads to economic collapse and widespread riots.

5388,"&gt;&gt;Hoekstra reasons thus: Only if 'Europe' can enforce fiscal and financial policies at the nation-state level, then Eurobonds would be an option. This is not the case (nor does Wobke have any intention to change the status quo in this regard).
&gt; 
&gt;This isn't an all out disagreement. The Dutch government has their concerns about the Eurobonds. The Dutch government started the EU project alongside the other founding members such as Italy **with the idea that the EU would be strictly a trade union**. It already conceded to becoming a monetary union, but becoming a fiscal union is a giant red line.

MISTAKE! The original deal was clearly expressed in the treaty of Rome, and it was to progressively move towards a federation of states. 



&gt;If you want the Dutch government to cross that line, you're going to need to convince them it's worth it or offer a guarantee that makes their concerns moot rather than just ""it'll work out as long as we hold hands"". Two of these guarantees being the enforcement of fiscal and financial policies at the nation-level, meaning member states have to be willing to give a bit of independence away in order for those rules to bind us all for the benefit of everyone. They want a concrete plan of action.

That's not true either. Rutte doesn't want a plan of action, he wants to stay in power. Which means not giving up sovereignty, which means stopping any kind of further integration. Because as you know, fiscal and financial policies would go both ways and the Netherlands would give up decision power with eurobonds or any kind of integration. The Dutch government is only protecting the status quo because it benefits from it.

You’re right that I’m not specifying how we should keep the spread at roughly what healthcare systems can handle. I’m also not specifying how we should brake as hard as we can. I don’t think anyone knows what is “right” yet, although the WHO clearly has some ideas. That wasn’t the point right now. The point is that we as a society should be clear about what we’re trying to do. If we’re trying to brake as hard as we can, we should say that and tell people that this thing that we’re doing now goes on for ~18 months.

No, inflation would not soften the interest rates. It would increase the interest rates.

Then you know the money you get back after a year is only worth 1000/1.1 Euro. So you need a higher interest rate to compensate for the loss by inflation.

I'm Dutch and I think the Eurobonds are kinda BS too. To me it sounds like we have to pay more interest over a loan we will actually pay back, while Italy pays more interest over a loan they won't pay back. So why should we ever agree to this?

If you include that in ""hurts anybody"", why dont you also include ""hurts the nationalists little brain""?

I said, You can give ""just the tip of the iceberg"", Ill accept it.. You didnt, you failed. Now you move the goal posts to war crimees ""on a massivce scale"", so you would agree little war crimes is ok now but not on a massivce scale? Ah huh. Which btw you are wrong, US commited war crimes on more massive scale than USSR. But your bias fails you to see this.

Also it seems you let US go with having commited war crimes, because they apologized. OMG. OK. Did they apologize for dresden? For Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Has Checzia apologized for there being Checz troops in Russia during Operation Barbarossa? Have you or your father and Chech presidents apologized to the Germans you expelled post WW2 from Sudetenland? Was that not a war crime to just deport civilians like that? Chechz did that. Chechz raped german civilians. Not only Red Army.

&gt; Czechoslovakia was not an Axis power and many Czech actively fought alongside Allies.

Being allies didnt stop US from invading and occupying Iceland or France, and still occupying Germany an ally.

Besides, if Checz really did so much fight with the allies, why did Checz not lift a finger for their own independence in 1938? Its not like in 1945 Checz was an independent country which Red Army occupied. You lost your independence in 1938 without basically a shot fired. And you know this was the mistake, which cost you destruction and 40 years of Red Army occupation. In 1938 Checz where a first world country, capable of resisting for at least a few months and had everything in place. But you chose the seemingly easy path and just let the Germans bring all their destruction on the Russians as if your country wasnt there?

Oh right, lets just forget that UK just sold you out like piglets in 1938. They bear no responsibility for destruction and suffering?

Look at the other country, Yugoslavia, as soon as Germans Italians and Hungarians attacked, resistence was formed. So much that, Red Army was not needed in 1945 except for villages and Belgrade, and Yugoslavia had an army which could tell Red Army the conditions for entering its clay condition being ""you enter and leave in 3 months"" and could enforce it. Chechs just didnt have anything in 1945, no real army, and btw in this time, words without army meant nothing. You got destroyed by Nazis in 1938, cry over that, your own leadership, and the anglo betrayal, not the Red Army having helped you remove those who wanted to exterminate you. 

You just cant be serious if you think, Checz can do basically nothing, then expect a Red Army to roll in while suffering 7 million losses, and let its border again be close to Ukraine instead of at Chechia? 
 
&gt; I wonder why.... 

Yeah lets kill more Russians, those subhumans...

&gt; but forget all his crimes. 

No thats not revisionism, Chechia wasnt invaded in 68 by Stalin, he was long dead. Thats just stupidity since they also forget crimes done by Stalin to Russians, such as Gulags and suffering 2 million Soviet soldiers lost for nothing at all, only due to his incompetence. Which leader was good for Russians? What could they answer to such a question, its not like they have so many great leaders to chose from. At least they survived as a people under Stalin, the other option would be gased and burned and forgotten like native american indians.

Which is exactly the same as what the outer letter in a postal vote does?

This isn't an all out disagreement. The Dutch government has their concerns about the Eurobonds. The Dutch government started the EU project alongside the other founding members such as Italy with the idea that the EU would be strictly a trade union. It already conceded to becoming a monetary union, but becoming a fiscal union is a giant red line.

If you want the Dutch government to cross that line, you're going to need to convince them it's worth it or offer a guarantee that makes their concerns moot rather than just ""it'll work out as long as we hold hands"".

5590,"I have that behind paywall, but either way - it does not matter if it is migrant related or not, those two things are separate issues, they just add on each other. Put yourself in the shoes of an average Italian, from your perspective, how has the euro helped your country? As far as you are concerned, your country is stagnating while other countries in the EU which were already richer than you before that are only getting richer and richer. You have seen people from Greece or Portugal being forced to adopt very strict austerity measures by the Northern EU countries, with the result of that being that their living standards have not improved at all, in fact in the Greek case, they massively deteriorated. On the top of that, it is again Greeks and Italians who are forced due to their geographic position to bear the main burden of migratory pressures (even though the migrants aim for Northwestern Europe) and the EU has proved to be unable to either take away the burden from them, or to stop the flow from coming to them.

Is it so hard to imagine that many people in the Southern Europe may come to the conclusion that the EU is in fact not really working for them? I am not saying it's necessarily a perfectly accurate opinion, but I can totally imagine why many people would arrive to this conclusion.

&gt; Maybe he had a good reason to be afraid of Soviets? Hm? 

Yeah, he did, he had 2 pretty daughters.

&gt; Can you, so highly educated person, provide a list of worst war crimes commited by the US Army during the WW2. You can give ""just the tip of the iceberg"", Ill accept it. 

Why not. Killing of Japanese prisoners of war was pretty common, the Japanese tended to fake surrender and then blew up soldiers who came to take them into custody with a grenade. After a while the US soldiers just stopped taking risks and started shooting those who surrendered. 

There were rapes and murders of civilians during the Battle of Okinawa.

But that doesnt change the fact that the USSR committed was crimes on a massive scale. And unlike the USSR, the US actually apologizes for interning their own citizens of Japanese descent. 

&gt; Do you think the Americans let the germans be? Are the germans still allowed to do as they please in foreign relations? Hint nord-stream. Can the germans today tell the Americans to GTFO of their land? Answer honestly. Hint, see what happened when Iraq asked the yankes to gtfo. 

Theres a slight difference you see, Germany was the country that triggered the war and actively fought on the enemy side. Czechoslovakia was not an Axis power and many Czech actively fought alongside Allies.

Nord Stream was opposed by the EU too (just like South Stream). And I hope the EU stops Germans from finishing it.

Im pretty sure Germans can tell Americans to GTFO and the US would have to do it. On the other hand, Poland is actively seeking to have more US soldiers stationed on their soil, I wonder why....

5616,"&gt; You have statistics about how you estimate and what approximations they entail... You dense motherfucker

Your claim was that the 22 billion estimate by economics was ""way off"" because it doesn't take into account all the additional benefits such as extra workers flowing into the country that are attached to set companies.

All of that information is readily and publically available. The reason why you won't find any estimates is because you have no idea how any of this actually works. You don't actually need to relocate your hq, or even any aspect of your company, to the Netherlands to apply. You just need to open a PO BOX and register.

Companies who move their HQ (And thus the added staff) to the Netherlands do so for different reasons.

&gt; you confuse the pronouns. you probably meant to say I didn't actually read...

I know you haven't read them because if you did you'd be able to cite anything that supports your argument. Thats not even adding to the fact that the vast majority of your links are unrelated to the Netherlands.

&gt;I like how everyone in reddit things that have mastered logical fallacies, and when they don't know what to say they throw ""that's whataboutism"" and ""strawman"". It's basic deductive skills, which obviously you lack.

Its not basic deductive skills, you're simply projecting your own meaning on his statement. It's also pretty much impossible to avoid ""That's whataboutism"" When your entire argument boils down to ""Netherlands are hypocrites for not giving aid unconditionally because hurdur tax haven"".

&gt;I don't get where you get the idea I am against capitalism.

Your multiple attempts at marginalizing the tax avoidance of socialist countries (200 billion tax avoidance? Woopsie, well they're just not perfect) and disproportionate focus on tax avoidance of capitalistic countries (Netherlands 20 billion in tax avoidance!? They're hypocrites for not giving unconditional aid!) , coupled with the the completely ridiculous victimizing of socialist countries by capitalistic countries makes it fairly obvious that a bias is at play here.  I don't think you genuinely hate capitalism, you're just unable to put 1 + 1 together in the sense that you fail to realize that the shortcomings of socialist countries are due to their rampant socialism and not due to their exploitation by capitalistic countries.

&gt; living Montgomery. LA, as NY and all the major cities are all vehemently against Trump.

Strawman argument. LA is still located in the US and is thus both financing and executing on policies from Washington.

&gt;The first tries to establish a political cimate based on bigotry, this is already the case in Netherlands.

Cite one example.

&gt;Keep posting articles. Your argument is that Greece lied, which I admit. Now try to think. Does Greece has the power, means, and capital to fool everyone?

I mean I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to argue here? How is it relevant whether Greece was succesful in hiding it or not? It's not really a secret that Greece joined the Euro on false pretense so they have been succesfull in hiding it in that sense. The whole point is that Greece caused enormous damage to the Union and the Euro and required investment of billions of euro's from other countries. Citing Greece as an example of ""The north benefitting at the expense of the south"" when everyone lost out on Greece is interesting to say the least.

&gt;As it should. Countries should point each other's shortcomings so they can try to improve. It's a shame that Southern countries don't follow that principle and allow Netherlands' tax heaven.

But that wasn't your argument, remember? Your argument was that the Netherlands were hypocrites for setting conditions to the aid they were to provide.

&gt; You are too thick to understand what's the difference by borrowing from the markets and getting a loan from a country.

5674,"Sure. When you have a pension system that is capital based, they invest their money. The supervisor looks at the amount of money they have in investments and the future expected rate of return. If the expected rate of return (based on a risk free rate, i.e. roughly the interest rate of German or Dutch bonds) is very low, the supervisor will assume that longterm interest income on the invested capital will be equally low. So, when the supervisor decides whether pensions can be indexed to inflation, he will take that into account. Now, with interest rates being super low, the supervisor assumes that the Dutch investments in pensions will have a very low rate of return, and therefore there is not enough money to index the pensions. Dutch pensions have not been indexed for about a decade now. We have growth, we have budget surpluses, but our pensioners (and we have a lot too) get not a penny more a year. If interest rates go up, we pay say 2% more interest on 400 billion in bonds. That is 8 billion a year. But the supervisor of the pension system will also allow for higher pensions. And those are taxed, up to about 50% top rate, plus, if people get more pensions, they spend more, which means more VAT income, up to 25% of what is spent. We lose billions in tax revenue due to the non-indexing of pensions, and our pensioners are getting pretty angry with losing purchasing power to inflation every year and never being compensated for it.

And to be honest, they blame this also on countries like Greece and Italy, believing that the ECB is just keeping rates low so that Italy and Greece can pay the interest on their debts which are so high, and thus 'stealing' interest money from the Dutch pension system.",,/r/europe/comments/fwiel0/large_majority_of_dutch_parliament_votes_against/fmpvvqi/,slvk,1586288292

5779,"When the US was founded in 1787, the population of the US was 4 million. Of those 4 million, roughly 10% were German and 50% were English. Then roughly 6 million Germans immigrated to the US between 1820 and World War I, while an extra 3 million more English people immigrated to the US.

&amp;#x200B;

The US saw extreme population growth during this period. The population of the country was doubling every 20-30 years from natural population growth even before immigration because the fertility rate was around 7 children per woman. So even though the population of the US was 4 million in 1790, it was 23 million 60 years later in 1850. Then the population tripled over the next 50 years and was 76 million in 1900.

&amp;#x200B;

It is mathematically impossible for English people to not be the largest ancestry group in the US. There were already roughly 10 million English-Americans in 1850, then several million more English people immigrated to the US during the 1800s. The only way that Germans would be the largest ethnic group would be if the German-American birth rate was significantly higher than the English-American one and there is no evidence of that.

&gt;In 1900, an estimated 28,375,000 or 37.8% of the population of the  United States was wholly or primarily of English ancestry from colonial  stock.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\_Americans#Number\_of\_English\_Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Americans#Number_of_English_Americans)

&amp;#x200B;

You can see how that makes sense. The English population was around 50% in 1790 and decreased to 37.8% by 1900 because there had been more immigration from outside of England during that period. Even if 25% of modern day Americans are english then they'd still be the largest group.

5796,"Spoken from my perpective, it would do political harm in a very big way.

Northern European countries struggle with populism too. In Germany it is the AfD, which has its roots in Euro-Sceptisism. The Euro is (largely) unpopular in Germany too. So with a German government signing a treaty to pay for other states debts, this situation would explode and could realisticly lead to a Dexit.

In an economic way it wouldnt solve problems too. For memory ... interests are a risk premium. Banks, insureances and investment fonds dont charge high interest rates from Greece and Italy because its trendy. They do because the risk of a national economy not able to pay its debts is higher when they have 100% debts in relation to their BIP than 50%.

So the high interest rates are an incentive for politics to not make large debts anymore and decreasing them. But when states like Greece and Italy would be able to raise money on the same interest rates as Germany (again), there wouldnt be such an incentive anymore ... and with Eurobonds no control too.

While I admit, that the Eurozone has conceptional flawes, from which Germany profits and Italy/Greece is suffering, Eurobonds wont solve the problem here.

5809,"Thank you very much! That is really insightful. The part which piqued my interest in the beginning was the ""unchangeable"" part. You wrote

&gt;Italy and Spain had to change supposedly unchangeable parts of their Contitutions during the debt crisis, and did so overnight.

As far as I understand it right now Italy (and Spain) tried to change a part of their constitution which is hard to change but not impossible (at least you wrote that and I don't know any better to make any corrections regarding that). And that is actually the part there I think the current discussion regarding the Euro/Coronabonds is problematic and the reason why the comparison of the constitutional changes in Italy (and Spain) aren't comparable to the German problem. Germany literally can't change the article needed for Coronabonds (That would be Art. 20 GG). The article is protected by an eternity clause (Art. 79 (3) GG). The only way to change that is by ""dissolving"" Germany and writing a  completely new constitution. Even if that would be attempted it wouldn't help with the current situation or with the coming ""fallout"" since that would take years maybe even a decade or more and a referendum would be necessary which is not really a good idea during a pandemic.

Regarding your other comments of course in the end the court is always right but I was interested in the counter argument and why someone would write something along the lines of ""the interpretation of the court was/is wrong"" as you did with 

&gt; Yes... due to an ""incorrect interpretation"".

It was to be expected that we're missing a large number of cases. Some are hoping that number is very high, much higher than theirs here, which would mean we're only scraping off the most severe cases currently and actual fatality rate is much lower, making this more comparable to a bad flu season.

Their number is well within what's to be expected and the fatality rate they calculate off of it is quite high at 1.

Or to put it in their own words:

&gt; Implications of all the available evidence  

&gt; Our estimates of the case fatality ratio for COVID-19, although
&gt; lower than some of the crude estimates made to date, are
&gt; substantially higher than for recent influenza pandemics
&gt; (eg, H1N1 influenza in 2009). 

&gt;  With the rapid geographical
&gt; spread observed to date, COVID-19 therefore represents a
&gt; major global health threat in the coming weeks and months.
&gt; Our estimate of the proportion of infected individuals requiring
&gt; hospitalisation, when combined with likely infection attack
&gt; rates (around 50–80%), show that even the most advanced
&gt; health-care systems are likely to be overwhelmed. These
&gt; estimates are therefore crucial to enable countries around

The argument was, it's bad because we could have just paid for it ourselves. It wasn't anything else, it's just bass ackwards attempts to grab for straws that it was anything more clever, or deserving of engagement than that.

I'm not going to give the gift of more respect than a dumb idea deserves by bringing more stuff into it.

5973,"&gt;Yeah because serious economists understand the domino effect. Having these companies there can create liquidity for the banks, attract people that Netherlands has not educated, etc, etc. It's in the articles, but yeah sure, it's just my bs.

Oh look, STILL no number or even an estimate. Even with the so called ""domino"" effect it's not going to be anywhere near the size of the shadow economy of countries like Greece and Italy that are up to 30% of GDP.

&gt;that's what you don't get. It's not, and Netherlands of course can ask what it deems right, but are in no place to lecture others, especially when said others allowed it (and other countries in EU) to operate as tax heavens.

It absolutely is because 22 billion isn't anywhere near 200 billion euro like it in Italy or 30% of national GDP like in Greece.

&gt;Dude can you stop jumping around? You asked for an example and I gave one. Yes, it almost destroyed the country, numerous articles in the net that I am not bothering to post because I ll just try to ""bs"" you again. At the end of the day imagine profiting by your ally's misery. 

Ehm, What? Greece literally deceived and lied about its financials for decades to join the Euro and while in the Euro, all while receiving billions every year. It had a shadow market of 30% of GDP with bonkers social policies that let people retire at the age of 50 (!!) but no, It's actually the troika's fault that the country collapsed, even though economy has actually been growing for years now. Greece has cost other countries literally billions of Euro and you want to use it as an example of how ""The North profited at the expense of the South""? 

The lack of self awareness in Southerners is staggering.

&gt;Did he resign? Are you complaining about the outrage??? Hearing all these crap you end up believing that this is true and hence he was right saying it. And yes they let it slide. They should have followed de gaulle's empty chair policy until that bigot resigned.

Ofcourse he didn't Resign, resigning over a single metaphor statement like that would be bonkers. The outrage was absolutely petty but also not surprising considering the hysterical reactions of entitled Southerners.

&gt;Are you maybe two people that alternating between answers? Italy says we need aid, Netherlands says why do you need aid? you must be audited. Go to ESM. Italy says we saw how great Greece was after ESM, we need something else, we need eurobonds so we will be able to borrow ""cheap"" money from the markets and increase investor confidence. Netherlands says no you are trying to trick us so we will pay your debts. So yes at this point Netherlands looses any ""moral"" point and people stop turning their eyes to the shit it does and say you are in no point to give moral lectures, and of course they are right. 

You live in Lalaland.

Let me give you a much more accurate portrayal of the situation.

Italy says we need aid. But hold up! Italy will ONLY accept aid in the form of Eurobonds, which they have now renamed to corona bonds (not opportunism btw). With these bonds, Italy can now loan and make the Netherlands responsible for its debts when they can't afford to pay them anymore, which is fully in line within expectations because Italy is loaded with debt, partly because its population isn't paying taxes. 

The Netherlands will have no say in how the money is spend or how much money is borrwed but will have to pick up the bill eventually. this means that the Netherlands will lose part of its its sovereignity over its own finances who, a reminder, already is the largest contributor to the EU per capita.

Netherlands (along with Germany) rightfully point to the ESM as its literally set up to deal with this particular situation which Italy agreed to and also partly funded. Italy says No, because Italy doesn't want to lose any sovereignity and only wants funding without conditions. Italy demands that the Netherlands gives up its sovereignity over its finances, not Italy. Italy demands that the Netherlands signs the blank cheque while they continue on their path of mismanagement which is actually against the European treaty under which the Euro was formed.

The idea that the Netherlands loses its ""moral"" point by saying no to eurobonds and because it (22 billion tax evasion)  doesn't want to sign a blank cheque for countries like italy (200 Billion euro in tax evasion)  shows that your moral values are absolutely bonkers.

In a way, you are the embodiment of the South. The complete lack of self awareness, the lack of willing to take any form self responsibility, the projection and the misplaced feeling of entitlement.
