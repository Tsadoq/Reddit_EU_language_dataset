5,"I know enough about money to know that 200 billionaires have more combined wealth than over 50% of the TOTAL human population combined.  

That's criminal and abhorrent in my eyes no matter how much legislation they ""purchased"" to make it legal.   
No person should be richer than an ENTIRE COUNTRY let alone MULTIPLE.   
No amount of hard work justifies such a wealth disparity.   
No amount of giving back to charity absolves you of the sins you committed to generate that money.   
No amount of bought up media corporations will be enough to hide the truth.  
These people are monsters and you don't have the words to convince me otherwise that this GREED they are displaying is in any way justified.   
The fines they do get they just see as the ""cost of doing business""   
They do what they want and we are just pawns in their games to uphold a few decimals in their bottom line.   
Stop defending them, they would throw you under the bus for a couple of bucks if they haven't already.   
The stockholm syndrome you are displaying is staggering.

Our judicial system is flawed by simple nature of humans being flawed, it is however somehow always in favor of the rich and never the poor.   
How can there be justice if justice can be bought?   
That's just economical darwinism, which this world is FULL off.

41,"Both of your statements are obviously  untrue. Which seems to say something about your lack of honest intention here. 

A different poster mentioned appeasement - which means not confronting, opposing or perhaps actually making concessions to an aggressive power. And you asked for an example of where appeasement had failed, or something like that.

I pointed out the example they presumably meant of where appeasement had failed. I dont really blame them for not bothering since I suspect your intentions are not honest as your comments continue to demonstrate. 

Iwever, The meaning if the word 'appeasement'is not bound to *every* characteristic of Nazi Germany it can apply to any aggressive power that is acting in a threatening manner - and i listed the many,  many ways in which Russia has been threatening, including territorial. A number of which including the use of ethnic minorities and invasion are obviously similar to but not necessarily identical to the Nazis. 

So the question is whether it is better to stand up to and against such aggression or to back down and allow it. Which respinse will actually curb the aggression and which encourage more. It hardly seems intellectually challenging to say that Putin will continue to do wants he wants if he can enjoy the benefits unconfronted. Therefore appeasing his aggressive actions will only encourage more of the same - thus *the failure of appeasement* and the relevance to the current situation. 

So appeasement is *not* confronting aggression. NAZI Germany is a historical example of it not working. Risdia is acting aggressively and it's reasonable to say that appeasement would also not work in this situation. 

The reference fits perfectly. Russia *is* bad - well Putins regime. And the bad faith of your poor attempt at deflection fools no one. But I've no doubt you'll try again.

71,"That plan was a disgusting joke

•The Turkish Cypriot constituent state, would have been integrated to Turkey making United Cyprus Republic (UCR) answerable to Turkey.[9]

•Turkey was granted rights to interfere with the Treaty between Egypt and the Republic of Cyprus on the Delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zone. Cyprus' rights to its Continental Shelf in the south would have also been answerable to Turkey.[9]

•Turkey was granted the right of stationing Turkish troops on the island of Cyprus perpetually, again making full independence impossible.[9]

•The Ethnic groups in Cyprus are Greek 77%, Turkish 18%, other 5% of the population. (2001) The Annan plan equates the representation of the two major ethnic groups in the proposed Senate and in the Supreme Court giving 50-50 representation to the two communities. The majority becomes a minority in important decision centres.[10]

•The plan created a confederation even though it utilised the term ""federation"" because there was no hierarchy of laws, while central authority emanated from the so-called component states. Note that the United States abandoned its original confederal structure because it was unworkable. In 1789, a federal constitution was established containing a clear federal supremacy clause. The Supreme Court composed of equal numbers of Greek Cypriot (77% of population) and Turkish Cypriot judges (18% of population), plus three foreign judges; thus foreign actors would cast deciding votes.[11]

•The Plan did not include a settlement regarding the repatriation of Turkish settlers living on Greek Cypriot owned land in Northern Cyprus, while after 19 years, the possibility of abolishing the derogation of 5% of Greeks and Turkish citizens who could settle in Cyprus, is obvious, and the danger of a permanent mass settling of Cyprus by Turkey is visible. Nearly all the Turkish settlers would be granted citizenship or residence rights leading to citizenship. The central government would have limited control towards future Turkish Immigration. Those settlers opting to return to Turkey would be compensated by Cyprus and Greek Cypriots. Even though Turkey systematically brought in the settlers to alter the demography of the island, it had no responsibility for their Repatriation.

•The Plan simply disregarded the plain language and clear meaning of the Geneva Convention of 1949, section III, article 49, which prohibits colonisation by an occupying power. Article 49 states in its last paragraph: ""The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.""

•The Plan did not deal in full with the issue of demilitarisation of the legally invalid 'TRNC', and Greek Cypriots felt they had no reason to believe Turkish promises concerning the withdrawal of troops. Cyprus would be excluded from the European Common Defense and Foreign Policy, while Turkish troops would remain in Cyprus even after the accession of Turkey to the EU with intervention rights, (a military invasion - occasionally used euphemistically), in the future Greek Cypriot component state.

•Many Greek Cypriots interpreted the Right of Return policy as seriously flawed, meaning only 20% of Greek Cypriot refugees would be able to return over a time frame of 25 years, whereas Turkish Cypriots would have had full right of return. The plan denied to all Cypriots rights enjoyed by all other EU citizens (right of free movement and residence, the right to apply to work in any position (including national civil services, the right to vote).[12]

•Turkish Cypriots would have gained all their requested demands in the 24 hours following the referendum, had the plan been accepted. Greek Cypriot demands, however, were relegated to the long term - as well as being dependent on the good will of Turkey to fulfil its obligations.

•The return of the Turkish occupied land will take place in the period between three and a half months and three and a half years from the moment the solution is signed with no guarantees whatsoever that this shall be implemented. The Cypriot-Greek proposal of placing these areas under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and not the Turkish army has been rejected.

•The Plan did not address the issue of the British Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) on the island, although parts of the SBAs would be transferred to the governments of the two constituent states. The British were granted rights to unilaterally define the continental shelf and territorial waters along two base areas and to claim potential mineral rights. Under the 1959-1960 Zürich and London Agreements, Britain did not have such rights (see the 2nd annex to the Additional Protocol to the 1959 Treaty of Establishment).

•The plan absolved Turkey of all responsibility for its invasion of Cyprus and its murders, rapes, destruction of property and churches, looting and forcing approximately 200,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes and property. The Cyprus government filed applications to the European Commission on Human Rights on September 17, 1974 and on March 21, 1975. The Commission issued its report on the charges made in the two applications on July 10, 1976. In it the Commission found Turkey guilty of violating the following articles of the European Convention on Human Rights",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/nwjr62/dictators_only_think_of_themselves/h1dpxv1/,Chrisovalantiss,1623399388

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-03/global-food-prices-surge-to-highest-in-almost-a-decade-un-says

Food prices rose in a uniform manner to the highest prices we have seen in a long time. The article suggests it is a decade but the UN noted it was the steepest increase they have ever recorded. This isn’t immediately obvious but on average food has increased some 21% since April of this year. This isn’t all foods but you should have noticed a 10-20p in crease on dairy, a slightly higher increase in meat and so on. 

The reality is the short-term impacts of Brexit are being clouded by the current circumstances and the emergency measures in place. It is impossible to quantify right now how Brexit is having an impact in terms of food costs because this is being masked by COVID. By the end of next year a clearer picture should be painted but until then we can’t say for certain how much Brexit is impacting food prices. 

I know personally that Brexit has impacted logistics making it difficult for super markets to source their products in a timely manner. This has caused an increase in prices but as I have said - we can’t say for certain how much of this is Brexit related and COVID related. The border situation is bad and it is currently a nightmare for EU/EEA states to trade with the U.K. In a way the British are lucky COVID hit, the government were given a mandate to implement extreme economic policy that may very well have off-set what would have been a hefty recession.

133,"Conservative, right-wing opinions are being silenced on social media, Facebook and Twitter are blocking inconvenient politicians, the speakers at a parliamentary seminar on freedom of expression on social media said. The seminar was organised by MPs Patrik Nacher (ANO) and Jan Skopeček (ODS) together with the Society for the Defence of Freedom of Expression.

The lower house of parliament recently sent an amendment to the Criminal Code that would punish restrictions on freedom of speech on the internet to a second reading. Its author is non-attached MP Václav Klaus Jr., who gave a rousing speech at a panel discussion.

""It's not five minutes to twelve, it's twelve thirty. US President Trump's social networks have been blocked. In the Czech Republic, we have dozens of cases where a young person honestly built up a clientele on the internet, people contributed to him, but his website was liquidated because he had conservative views. I do not want to live in such a world,"" Klaus said.

MEP Jan Skopeček said that social networks Facebook and Twitter are now the main tools of political campaigning, yet he said they restrict some political currents. ""If democracy is still to be based on a fair competition between political parties, then the moment that some politicians are favoured by social networks and on the other hand other candidates have limited access to them, then we cannot talk about free competition between political parties,"" Skopeček said. For example, Facebook recently deleted the official page of non-attached MP Lubomír Volný for violating the rules.

""Only conservative, right-wing views are restricted on the internet, whereas left-wing progressive views are given the green light, even if they are sometimes nonsense,"" he also said.

Skopeček talked about how he believes there is a monopoly on truth on certain topics, mentioning issues such as climate and gender. ""Anyone who starts questioning these monopoly truths is automatically considered a weirdo who has no business in a decent society. It provokes self-censorship in people, which is even worse than the blocking of Facebook for several days, as unacceptable as I find it,"" the ODS MP said.

""There is a tendency from one side to say that certain opinions are wrong and to silence them,"" another panelist, game developer Daniel Vávra, chimed in.

Networks have a double standard, Nacher said
Patrik Nacher, an MP for ANO, criticised social networks for allegedly using a double standard. ""Facebook did not delete the blatant lie when someone wrote about me that I stole drapes from the central warehouse. On the other hand, it sometimes deletes when someone has an opinion about wearing drapes. There is a difference between a lie and an opinion,"" Nacher said.

Ivan David, an SPD MEP and former health minister, also took part in the discussion. Representatives of the Pirates were also invited, but according to the organisers, they declined to participate given the composition of the panellists. ""When someone says a priori that they will not talk to us, it speaks volumes about their approach to democratic discussion,"" Vávra commented.

Pirates are a frequent target of fake news on the networks. A false report about First Deputy Chair Olga Richterová, who said that citizens should give their apartments to migrants, was shared by tens of thousands of people and the politician is suing over it.

Gabriela Sedláčková, project manager at the Society for the Defense of Freedom of Expression, said the organization collects complaints about unfair blocking on social media, which she said includes hundreds of cases. ""Top of the list are topics related to health care and medicine because of the covida pandemic. When you express a certain opinion about covid and vaccination, a social network can block you, saying you are violating community policies. But common historical facts and topics related to the EU, eroticism, sex and family are also deleted,"" Sedláčková said.

Censorship of opinions, she said, also applies to the social network LinkedIn, which is mainly used for networking. ""If you share an uncomfortable opinion there, 'diversity managers' from your company may contact you and tell you that you have to delete the opinion. We've gotten to the point where we have blackmail from colleagues,"" Sedlacek said.

153,"&gt;Of course there are species that represent intermediate states, and no group is perfect, just as biology is never perfect.

Which was my point initially. Your first comment implied that the labeling and biology understanding that we have now is perfect, including about human's sex and gender. I disagreed with that notion and tried to explain it, but most likely poorly.

&gt;A mutation has to be of a specific type and provide advantage for it to manifest. Everything else usually just dies off.

Yes, but is that always the case? I know that usually a mutation to survive, its organism/host, has to survive, thus we say that a mutation has to be useful to its organism so that it survives, otherwise it dies. However, the existence of a mutation does not necessarily kill an organism, even if it is useless, so it is possible for an organism to survive with a/some ""useless"" mutation(s) in its body. As you are biologist, would you say that there are, for example, NO useless parts of/in the human body? Or in other organisms?

&gt;  
Nature is random and it's not. The topic is complex, but you should grasp the basic concepts before you dive in

Well, I think I grasp them and the fundamentals are as I said: everything happens randomly, that randomness generates some order in some places (including rules like what can and can not happen either in terms of physics or biology), and then it again sooner or related goes to randomness/entropy. There is no ultimate reason behind any of this. There is no reason why planets are the way they are and why they orbit a sun/star, we know only the physical laws that make them do  that. Same for any other physical/natural laws even be it on lower or higher levels, but ultimately, we still do not understand whole lot of things about the universe and its workings, including its buildings blocks, the atoms, and below them. So everything could change with time as we discover stuff, even our understanding on biological level about human biology and sexes as they are built upon the same building blocks that we do not yet fully understand and comprehend.",,/r/europe/comments/nwmsa7/student_cleared_after_being_investigated_for/h1dhq5n/,Killerfist,1623392333

224,"&gt; It is urgent that we teach the coming generation to think by themselves.

What prequisites enable it happening?

Education harms those in power by introducing ways to challenge them. This isn't an issue for countries that have embraced democracy already: change of power is expected and encouraged. What about those countries where oppression is common and deeply embedded into the culture?

I grew up in Russia shortly after the fall of the USSR. Russia was never a democracy: not historically, not at present. There were always tsars and emperors, nevermind hard rulers of the local variety. There is certainly one now.

Today, you can to jail for spreading ""subversive material"" online. I could, for example, go to jail for sharing that one picture of Putin in heavy makeup. Young men and women have gone to jail for so much as attending protests and sharing articles criticizing the government.

The education system is terrible. Loads of busywork, with the goal of not developing a personality or even a set of informed opinions but passing a regimented test. Children are scared into submission, being told that their failure during school and *especially* the state exams will inevitably result in them failing in life.

240,"&gt;Without an education, there’s no real democracy.

I think that's *mostly* untrue. The important thing isn't education. The 15+ years spent in school don't teach people how to run a country or barely anything about politics. What's important is being invested and willing to do a bit of research into topics because countries are always changing and the issues they face are always changing. Knowing history or chemistry or comp sci doesn't make you a better voter. Being able to analyze information and being willing to come to your own conclusions is the important part.

Far too often people find a research paper or ""expert"" who says what they want to hear and don't bother with any further thought or research. Or they read something on their facebook or twitter feed, see everyone else agree with it, and then jump on the bandwagon with no further thought.

344,"&gt; Most of Demosthenes' major orations were directed against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357 BC, when Philip seized Amphipolis and Pydna, Athens had been formally at war with the Macedpnians. In 352 BC, Demosthenes characterised Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticised those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was as dangerous as the king of Persia.

Yeah, he seems quite biased to me. Pretty anti-Macedonian and pro-Athenian, if you ask me. Not an objective opinion. He was a politician (and orator) after all, he wanted the best for Athens. It's funny how people always refer to him, don't you have any other ancient greek source claiming that Macedonians weren't Greeks?

434,"&gt;the sex of a person matters and matters not. It always depends.

We're not breaking new grounds with this one, but when we're talking about a scenario where it does matter and you bring up a scenario where it doesn't matter, then I think it's fair to question either your ability to construct an argument or if you have another motive.

Not to mention the ""I don't care what sex the ppl have we hire. They have to be decent persons"" which suspiciously sounds like the ""I don't care who you have sex with as long as you're not an asshole about it"" dog whistle in discussions about homosexuality. If you don't understand how this is a dog whistle then maybe the ""I don't care whether you're black or white, as long as you're not a muderer or a rapist"" version will make it clear for you

And finally that you would say ""In all honesty, i do have problems with the modern perception of the sex of a person."" when literally the first argument someone will bring up in a discussion about transgender people when defending them is that sex =/= gender, and that while sex is defined at birth, gender is a social construct.

So to sum up you bring up scenarios that don't support your argument for no reason, you use an admittedly mild version of a popular dog whistle, and you present your scientific views as clashing with some straw man about the ""modern perception of the sex of a person"". Individually those could all be seen as a defect in your reasoning or ability to make an argument, but added up we can see a trend forming.

Whether they are politicians, journalists, scientists, companies, advertising, pundits, influencers, you name it.

This is getting ridiculous, Transylvania was part of the Avar Khaganate and Bulgaria before the Hungarian conquest. Romanians lived east of the Carpaths, in what was later called Wallachia. Under Bulgarian rule then in a limbo between Hungary and the Ottomans, then under just the Ottomans before independence. Most Romanian moved to Transylvania as sheepherders starting from the late middle ages when the Hungarian population (which was not in small part assimilated Slav) drastically declined.

And similar thought process applies everywhere. If you're from Braila or Giurgiu, there are probably some Turkish ancestors; from the North East some Russian/Ukrainian; from Transylvania some Hungarian etc etc.

What a lot of people here don't realize, is that Integration happens with generations. The first gen can't speak the local language, and are therefore isolated from the local population. So they stay with their own. The next gen grow up in European schools, they learn the language, make friends here, fall in love with the media. By the time they grow up, they have more in common with those in their new nation than they did with those back home. Even those that go to Islamic or Asian schools just ending going to a normal high-school by 14 because they wanna get into uni. Integration is basically impossible to avoid if your a minority.

674,"Did I miss something or is this week ""war crime week"" or ""point at germany and start complaining about everything and just go *they are nazis*""

Jesus people get a grip on. And stop posting massacres out of context. Why was this village attacked? Was their for example partisan action or was it a ""for every german soldier killed 100 random civilians get executed"" kind of massacre? What SS forces did it, because this might be a suprise to many but in 1944 the Waffen-SS (which are 99% of the time the ones people actually mean when they talk about massacres on non german soil) was one of the most international ideological military forces in europe. 

Also it was the nazi parties military wing, not part of the german military. The Waffen-SS was only nominally under german army command for obvious reasons during combat.

War brutality wasnt anything unusual. The same guys did similar things to germans in the last month of the war. The famous ""lamp post hangings"" didnt occure by themselfs. So please stop generalizing like ""all germans are nazis, all germans are war criminals, germans today are equaly bad"" etc. We hear it all and most of it is just bullshit anyway. The war and why humans did certain things is a very big topic and i garantee you most people alive today if they were in the same situations as the average german soldier in 1941-1945 would have looked away or ignored the war crimes as well.

People often forget that ""the germans"" didnt start becoming nazis over night. There were still people of all educational background, all political backgrounds, etc. in the german military and all people somewhat participated or were passive observers. And no you cant narrow such things down to ""nationality"". Nationality is only a theoretical fiction based on borders drawn the last 200 years. The anwser is never as easy as is depicted in some of the comments under all these war crime posts recently

Oh and please stop with the ""germany needs to pay reperations"" bullshit. You countries gouvernments had over 70 years to deal with that issue and there were even two germanies you could make your claim to. Even in 1991 with unification reperation claims (for example with Poland) were solved, etc.

Also I find it always rather funny when people talk about reperations or compensations its always germany that should pay. Where are Polands reperations to the czechs for their active participation in the german-hungarian-polish invasion of czech lands in 1938? Where are the hungarian reperations for the same event? Did Italy pay greece or albania already for invading/occupying them? Or Japan to anybody in asia....or well the colonial powers for exploiting their colonies for the last 200 years or the damage for ""reconqering"" their colonies post WW2? Did the allies already pay up the damage they inflicted on each other (US/British bombings in western europe outside germany, Britain sinking the french fleet, etc.). I mean to go even further we could tak about polish reperations for breaking the versailles treaty several times and illegally annexing german lands post WW1 and starting an armed revolt in upper silesia because they didnt like the result of the internationally observed vote in the area (60% voted to remain in Germany).....

Or well...if we want to go down this rabithole truly we also have to restart talking about germanies eastern border because according to some poles there were never any repreation treaties with them (there were) so by that definition germany also never accepted the (technically) illegal annexation of eastern german lands by Poland and the soviets. The Jalta and Potsdam conference clearly talk about ""german territory under polish/soviet managment"". 

I hope at least some of you got my point after this small rant. It is a rabit hole that really nobody needs to open up again. Most of the people who actually suffered during WW2 are already dead and we should stop arguing over their corpses to get some money or land we feel ""entitled"" to do to beeing related by blood to actual victims. We should instead be fucking happy that we never had to suffer through any of that nighmare and start working on the future instead of beeing stuck in the past.

And yes I can already see the comments of ""*how dare a german talk like that, your family is evil, etc*"" comming in. Apparently some people still believe *blood guilt* and thereby following *collective punishmen*t is a thing in modern justice systems.....fun fact for you guys: that is the same justification the nazis actually used to justify nearly all their crimes.

681,"&gt;No, as I've said before, Scotland was a Labour heartland for nearly a century and Labour was a traditionally Scottish party, considering its founder, was Scottish 

Labour are irrelevant to the fact that the SNP are by far the largest party and the independence vote has only grown since the 2021 election.

&gt;No they don't, the real one is shared with everyone else whilst the other nations have their own in addition.

 The 'House of Commons of England' as it used to be known, now has 650 members. 543 which are English. Despite some empty gestures, the government departments are also based in England.

&gt;*Gove has been working on dismantling the civil service since he was in education, he'll probably bring Cummings back in to continue the work.*   
&gt;  
&gt;He's not going anywhere because they poll poorly compared to Boris and there are many marginals which helped the Torys stay in power of which many were former Labour strongholds, that as well as the vaccine rollout being a success.

I think Boris will be replaced before the next election, I'm surprised he's lasted this long. It's definitely down to how he polls.

&gt;*You don't need a 'neo nazi' resurgence to persecute minorities. The Home Office are doing that right now.* They're not persecuting minorities though

Foreigners, immigrants, Britons without citizenship status? I'd say they've made a good start. They've also signaled their intention to victimise the poor.

&gt;Again, just lending credence to the ability of this function to be abused by people in power whilst ignoring that it enables governments to have a picture of their society which they can use as a benchmark to provide services tailored to particular groups. 

The risks associated with collecting ethnic data on citizens clearly outweigh the benefits, particularly within a system that has previously practiced internment, concentration camps and martial law. Citizens of Belfast in the 1960s probably also thought ""It couldn't happen here"" because they were as British as Finchley.

&gt;Whilst I don't agree with the internal markets bill it isn't depriving the devolved regions of their ability to function properly. 

That's precisely what it is intended to do. That's why the Welsh legislature sought a judicial review and the Scots said the act is *""radically undermining the powers and democratic accountability of the Scottish Parliament.""*

&gt;*I think it's a disgrace, but I'm certainly not blaming the good citizens of England.* Of course, you're just implying that they have more rights than other British citizens and singling them out.

No implication, England controls the 'Central Government' - to ignore that is to fail to understand the forces pulling the UK apart. By 'England' I mean a small cohort of publicly-educated politicians, rather than the general populace. The Tories are frightened now and trying to pull the smaller nations closer. That won't work.

&gt;That isn't the same as the regional parliaments being cut off from funding to stop them functioning.

I think the expression is 'slowly starve'. It's Boris Johnson's stated ambition *'devolution in Scotland has facilitated the rise of separatism and nationalism in the form of the SNP, and that that's trying to break apart the United Kingdom'*. There's an unusually clear-eyed profile of him and his ambitions [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/boris-johnson-minister-of-chaos/619010/)

&gt;... Anyway, no, I actually looked at the table which charts the support for independence on Wikipedia, backed by citations, independence always receives a boost during election time, but the trend has been towards no.

And then you linked to an article that said the opposite? That's less than convincing.

&gt;*I suppose that's how it looked from a regional perspective.*   
&gt;  
&gt;There's no ""suppose"" About it, that's what it was.

From a broader European perspective, France and Spain used the Jacobite cause as a regional theatre to further their ambitions against Protestant Europe. But the local view is good too.

&gt;Uh huh, the NI bollocks is just another situation similar to where you actually had US pressuring the UK to accept the Anglo Irish agreement of 1985, it's something which will boil for years to come but isn't enough to wreck the relationships of all respective parties.

The US probably aren't as upset as the EU and China. It will be interesting to see how it pans out. It looks like some kind of compromise might be possible on NI if the UK accept equivalence on food standards.

&gt;I would also argue that your Irish nationalism blinds you to the fact the NI situation is a storm in a teacup in comparison to the situation with China of which the US EU and the UK are all broadly in agreement on.

The single market is an existential concern for the EU, but they'll ramp up the pressure slowly and certainly not at a summit. They can probably sit back and watch the US go off. 

The US can do whatever they want and the UK will just agree. From the US point of view, the stakes are small but it makes them look like the good guys, so it's worth their while to enforce an agreement that they are a guarantor of.

&gt;*The situation will only get worse from here as Britain turns to India, Canada and New Zealand.*   
&gt;  
&gt; No it won't, considering we've nearly agreed a trade deal with Oz and NZ in light of us joining the Cptpp as well as China implementing tariff restrictions on Australian exports.

You would think so, the way the Tory party go on. But Britain hasn't signed any of those deals and the analysis of the deals they have signed doesn't look good. The Australians faced down the Chinese and they're back buying minerals and beef.

&gt;*If your attitudes are representative of the general population, I don't think that level-setting is going to happen any time soon.*   
&gt;  
&gt;I hope so, because the alternative is to become something like you.

I take it you're not referring to my good spelling or ability to follow arguments.

Have you heard this quote from Sartre? It's about anti-semites, but it is just as true for other voices making bad-faith arguments to hide their unpalatable opinions;

*""Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words.*

*The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.*

*If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.""*",,/r/europe/comments/n4i38b/joseph_plunkett_married_grace_gifford_in/h1bldij/,defixiones,1623355857

828,"&gt;Yes, voting for the SNP is definitely an 'anti-establishment' vote, in fact it's a whole 'get out of the union' anti-establishment vote. Do you think the Scots are just being 'stroppy'? 

No, as I've said before, Scotland was a Labour heartland for nearly a century and Labour was a traditionally Scottish party, considering its founder, *was Scottish*

&gt;They don't need a regional parliament, they have the real one - no window-dressing is required.

No they don't, the real one is shared with everyone else whilst the other nations have their own in addition. 

&gt;'Central Government' - that has a nice ring to it. Everyone else has a 'regional parliament'.

I guess it's an alien concept to yourself considering Ireland is smaller. 

&gt;It won't be long until a new PM is required. There could be an outside contender - Sunak, Patel? Gove has been working on dismantling the civil service since he was in education, he'll probably bring Cummings back in to continue the work.

He's not going anywhere because they poll poorly compared to Boris and there are many marginals which helped the Torys stay in power of which many were former Labour strongholds, that as well as the vaccine rollout being a success. 

&gt;They don't look so bad compared to the Tories. You had to reach back to the 1990s to find any evidence of corruption.

Then again ROI has a population of 4 million and we've not been under Tory rule for the entirety of the 21st century. 

&gt;You don't need a 'neo nazi' resurgence to persecute minorities. The Home Office are doing that right now.

They're not persecuting minorities though 

&gt;I refer you back to this pre-Windrush analysis; ""a campaign by local organisations and the media which urged people not to answer the question on race or ethnicity;...'If we say now who is and who is not of British descent, we may one day asked to ‘go home’ if we were born here or not’""

Again, just lending credence to the ability of this function to be abused by people in power whilst ignoring that it enables governments to have a picture of their society which they can use as a benchmark to provide services tailored to particular groups. 

&gt;You were too lazy to read about the Internal Markets Bill. ""The act gives the UK Government the ability to directly spend on projects within Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, even if those policy areas normally fall under devolved competence.""

Whilst I don't agree with the internal markets bill it isn't depriving the devolved regions of their ability to function properly. 

&gt;I think it's a disgrace, but I'm certainly not blaming the good citizens of England.

Of course, you're just implying that they have more rights than other British citizens and singling them out.  

&gt;To save you the mental energy, here's a summary of the bill; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Internal_Market_Act_2020 

That isn't the same as the regional parliaments being cut off from funding to stop them functioning. 

&gt;Another lethargic classic; the article actually states 'support for Yes grows slightly following the SNP’s victory at the Holyrood elections'. Did you just google 'scotland supports the union' and paste the first result here?

I guess your go to byline is laziness which is ironic because it projects what you've done onto me and it also signifies your lack of knowledge on the subject you try to save face on. Anyway, no, I actually looked at the table which charts the support for independence on Wikipedia, backed by citations, independence always receives a boost during election time, but the trend has been towards no. 

&gt;I suppose that's how it looked from a regional perspective.

There's no ""suppose"" About it, that's what it was. 

&gt;Have you been following the G7 summit? Britain has picked fights with the EU, US and China. The Australian deal remains unsigned at the summit. I would argue that all these problems stem from an inability to face up to specific aspects of the imperialist past.

Uh huh, the NI bollocks is just another situation similar to where you actually had US pressuring the UK to accept the Anglo Irish agreement of 1985, it's something which will boil for years to come but isn't enough to wreck the relationships of all respective parties. 

I would also argue that your Irish nationalism blinds you to the fact the NI situation is a storm in a teacup in comparison to the situation with China of which the US EU and the UK are all broadly in agreement on. 

&gt;The situation will only get worse from here as Britain turns to India, Canada and New Zealand.

No it won't, considering we've nearly agreed a trade deal with Oz and NZ in light of us joining the Cptpp as well as China implementing tariff restrictions on Australian exports.

833,"&gt;A, Stalin’s “offer” to the Allies was that he prevent Germany annexing Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland… by then forcing Poland to accept that Stalin occupied their country to provide “a route” to send a million soldiers to “defend” Czechoslovakia.

I may be misremembering, but I believe the talks between the Brits and the Soviets started after the Munich agreement, so the Sudetenland were already out of the question. And how else were the Soviets to fight against Germany, if not by going through Poland?

&gt;The Romanians even offered that the Red Army go through Romania to do it, but that was turned down by Stalin.

You're going to need to provide a source for that, because all I can find on this topic is this short snippet from the wiki (but with citations) that contradicts your statement:

&gt;On 13 April 1939, France and the United Kingdom had pledged to guarantee the independence of the Kingdom of Romania. Negotiations with the Soviet Union concerning a similar guarantee collapsed when Romania refused to allow the Red Army to cross its frontiers.

&gt;And the USSR literally attempted to join the Axis powers.

Yes. In 1940. A year after the pact already started.

The industry is showing signs of decline in non-totalitarian countries.

&gt;[""We find that an eroding actor base, shrinking opportunities in liberalized electricity markets, the break-up of existing networks, loss of legitimacy, increasing cost and time overruns, and abandoned projects are clear indications of decline. Also, increasingly fierce competition from natural gas, solar PV, wind, and energy-storage technologies speaks against nuclear in the electricity sector. We conclude that, while there might be a future for nuclear in state-controlled ‘niches’ such as Russia or China, new nuclear power plants do not seem likely to become a core element in the struggle against climate change.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221462962030089X)

There is no business case for it.

&gt;[""The economic history and financial analyses carried out at DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been unprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in the future. Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry.... Financial investment calculations confirmed the trend: investing in a new nuclear power plant leads to average losses of around five billion euros.""](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.670581.de/dwr-19-30-1.pdf)

Investing in a nuclear plant today is [expected to lose 5 to 10 billion dollars](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121001301)

The nuclear industry can't even exist without legal structures that privatize gains and socialize losses.

&gt;[ If the owners and operators of nuclear reactors had to face the full liability of a Fukushima-style nuclear accident or go head-to-head with alternatives in a truly competitive marketplace, unfettered by subsidies, no one would have built a nuclear reactor in the past, no one would build one today, and anyone who owns a reactor would exit the nuclear business as quickly as possible.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2012/03/29/exelons-nuclear-guy-no-new-nukes/#3c8acf0a3c5d)

The peer-reviewed literatue

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030142152030327X

&gt; the cost of generating electricity using SMRs is significantly higher than the corresponding costs of electricity generation using diesel, wind, solar, or some combination thereof. These results suggest that SMRs will be too expensive for these proposed first-mover markets for SMRs in Canada and that there will not be a sufficient market to justify investing in manufacturing facilities for SMRs.

Even the German nuclear power industry knows they will cost more

&gt;[Nuclear Technology Germany (KernD) says SMRs are always going to be more expensive than bigger reactors due to lower power output at constant fixed costs, as safety measures and staffing requirements do not vary greatly compared to conventional reactors. ""In terms of levelised energy costs, SMRs will always be more expensive than big plants.""](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-nuclear-industry-cautious-about-usefulness-small-reactors-energy-transition)

What has never been supported is NuMeme's claims that it will be cheaper.  They also have never presented how they arrived at their costs, beyond 'gas costs this much, lets pretend ours will be cheaper'.


So why do so many people on reddit favor it? Because of a decades long PR campaign and false science being put out, in the same manner, style, and using the same PR company as the tobacco industry used when claiming smoking does not cause cancer.

A recent metaanalysis of papers that claimed nuclear to be cost effective were found to be illegitimately trimming costs to make it appear cheaper.

&gt; [Merck suppressed data on harmful effects of its drug Vioxx, and Guidant suppressed data on electrical flaws in one of its heart-defibrillator models. Both cases reveal how financial conflicts of interest can skew biomedical research. Such conflicts also occur in electric-utility-related research. Attempting to show that increased atomic energy can help address climate change, some industry advocates claim nuclear power is an inexpensive way to generate low-carbon electricity. Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using “overnight” costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes. If these trimmed costs are included, nuclear-generated electricity can be shown roughly 6 times more expensive than most studies claim. After answering four objections, the paper concludes that, although there may be reasons to use reactors to address climate change, economics does not appear to be one of them.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-009-9181-y)

It is the same PR technique that the tobacco industry used when fighting the fact that smoking causes cancer.

&gt; [The industry campaign worked to create a scientific controversy through a program that depended on the creation of industry–academic conflicts of interest. This strategy of producing scientific uncertainty undercut public health efforts and regulatory interventions designed to reduce the harms of smoking.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490543/)

&gt; [A number of industries have subsequently followed this approach to disrupting normative science. Claims of scientific uncertainty and lack of proof also lead to the assertion of individual responsibility for industrially produced health risks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490543/)

It is no wonder the NEI (Nuclear energy institute) [uses the same PR firm](https://thehill.com/opinion/letters/98257-double-check-from-whom-you-get-energy-information) to promote nuclear power, [that the tobacco industry used to say smoking does not cause cancer.](http://www.tmia.com/old-website/News/AstroTurf.htm)

&gt;[The industry's future is so precarious that Exelon Nuclear's head of project development warned attendees of the Electric Power 2005 conference, ""Inaction is synonymous with being phased out."" That's why years of effort -- not to mention millions of dollars -- have been invested in nuclear power's PR rebirth as ""clean, green and safe.""](http://www.tmia.com/old-website/News/AstroTurf.htm)

&gt;[And then there's NEI, which exists to do PR and lobbying for the nuclear industry. In 2004, NEI was embarrassed when the Austin Chronicle outed one of its PR firms, Potomac Communications Group, for ghostwriting pro-nuclear op/ed columns. The paper described the op/ed campaign as ""a decades-long, centrally orchestrated plan to defraud the nation's newspaper readers by misrepresenting the propaganda of one hired atomic gun as the learned musings of disparate academics and other nuclear-industry 'experts.'""](http://www.tmia.com/old-website/News/AstroTurf.htm)",,/r/europe/comments/nwgpny/finland_might_have_solved_nuclear_powers_biggest/h1a4lw0/,Well_Lubricated_Anus,1623333890

&gt; stopping its own citizens from leaving their country, alleging pandemic health reasons, but simultaneously allowing tourists to enter

https://dre.pt/web/guest/home/-/dre/155739190/details/maximized
(that's the actual law, enforced for around 3 months since Jan 31st)

https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/economia/coronavirus/detalhe/portugueses-nao-podem-sair-do-pais-controlo-nas-fronteiras-terrestres-restabelecido

During that time there were plenty of tourists around Lisbon. Not locally resident foreigners, obvious tourists. Yeah sure pandemic, health and all that, but then why were tourists allowed? I also know young people who found a job abroad and lost it because of this. And yes I know that's one of the ""exceptions"" but they required residence permit, so people who already had foreign jobs were fine, but people who found new jobs abroad were screwed. This shouldn't be happening in a democratic government.

Also, you know this happened, why would you mischaracterize my argument by calling it BS and saying it's not happening? Could have just mentioned I wasn't precise enough and that it happened in the past and is no longer enforced. But it did happen during 3 months not long ago.

&gt; ignoring the votes of their foreign residing citizens for the last presidential election because it was ""just too complicated"" to count them

https://observador.pt/opiniao/a-abstencao-forcada-dos-emigrantes/

https://www.wort.lu/pt/portugal/presidenciais-emigrantes-regressados-temporariamente-a-portugal-impedidos-de-votar-no-pa-s-600226

Plenty more sources out there, just Google the appropriate terms. People who were foreign residents, but came back to PT because of covid, were in a legal loophole that prevented them from voting. Eg. Person A has tax residency in Dublin, they come back to PT for a while, they want to vote. They have to go back to Dublin for their vote to count. Again, should not be happening in a democracy.

&gt; the government's border police brutally murdering a Ukrainian citizen by beating him up at the airport borders in Lisbon

Some more background on the story:
https://observador.pt/2021/01/21/sef-ja-pagou-indemnizacao-de-712-950-euros-a-viuva-de-ucraniano-morto-no-aeroporto-de-lisboa/

https://tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/julgamento/caso-sef-tudo-o-que-se-sabe-sobre-a-morte-de-ihor-homeniuk-no-aeroporto-de-lisboa

Basically, he was beaten up by border police (SEF) in 12 March 2020, just before covid, no one gave a shit until it landed on the news, it was ignored and delayed and excused for almost a year after his death, and only then the SEF director resigned.

The foreign minister was dismissive towards this case, protective of the SEF directory until she was forced to resign, actions came too late, and in the end they just payed his wife 700k to shut up.

The foreign minister needs to resign, and he still hasn't, the PM was protecting the foreign minister of course. There is no real accountability for the government in Portugal. People didn't even protest.

Ukraine wanting to join EU in a period where the EU presidency is held by Portugal, a country whose government murdered a Ukrainian citizen, tried covering it up and held no one in office accountable, is a very sad irony.

&gt; the justice minister attempting to corrupt the new European Public Prosecutor's Office by bumping the PM's friend to 1st place with a forged CV

https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-government-turmoil-eu-prosecutor-pick/

https://www.dn.pt/politica/governo-deu-informacoes-falsas-a-ue-na-escolha-do-procurador-europeu-13185507.html

Pretty simple, the government flat out lied in their favorite candidate's CV and gave that fake info to the EU, knowingly. They got caught doing it and people got pissed. Again, the Justice minister who was complicit in the adulteration of those documents, should have resigned. She did not and had the full public support of the PM again, like the foreign minister. Again, no accountability for the government in Portugal and no protests. 

&gt; media captured by governmental funding conditioned on not publishing bad PR

https://www.publico.pt/2020/05/27/politica/noticia/erc-chamada-dizer-apoio-15-milhoes-media-ilegal-1918226

https://observador.pt/2020/05/20/observador-rejeita-apoio-governamental-concedido-ao-abrigo-de-programa-destinado-aos-media/

There's a governmental support program that gives money to media. That program is under investigation because it might be inconstitutional, and it's criteria is not transparent.

If you live in Portugal for a while, you notice that news tends not to be critical of the government at all, which modulates its population's opinion of course. Everyone knows that if a newspaper criticizes the government, they will receive less funding.

One of those links is a center-right newspaper that is known for it's subscriber base and they rejected that funding after the government pointed out a ""mistake"" in the number alloted to that newspaper... Shady stuff, hard to find evidence, but everyone knows what's going on.

&gt; the PM covering up and not a single minister fired, accused or under investigation for any of those problems

Mentioned in some points above. Besides, what is enough to be considered as evidence in an online forum? This isn't a court, we're not trialing anyone, people are free to search and form their opinions based on whatever signals they find.

It's very hard to get evidence of corruption in Portugal because 1) its political, banking and judicial institucional are loaded with corruption and you can't join the club unless you are equally corrupt 2) people mostly care about it for vacation and Instagram, few care about it politically or for jobs 3) there is imense widespread corruption embedded into its culture, from the neighbors cheating the electric and water meters; to city hall demanding bribes for basic construction approvals; to a former PM altering environmental reports so he can profit by choosing his friend's construction company to build the new airport; to football club owners transporting drugs in tires; to ""philanthropists"" admitting to their scams on national recorded TV and explaining how they used stock in a company owned by his uncle, not him, to back a loan of millions from the national bank (that loan defaulted btw, and the government had to rescue that bank, again); and 4) its population and culture is so passive that they can be visibly robbed and all they will ever do is complain and say ""they're all the same, they all steal"", but never act; 5) and in the middle of all this shit all people care about and all news talks about is how outraging Ronaldo's shack is on top of a skyscraper in Lisbon... A lot to unpack, and I oversimplified and butchered a couple of points for sure, but a reddit thread isn't enough to unpack this.

Look up the Portuguese Snowden, Rui Pinto, that was a smart kid who involved several international police agencies that covered his back while the Portuguese police was trying to get him killed in prison. His Football and Luanda leaks got several football players and clubs prosecuted for tax evasion, exposed government corruption with football clubs and resulted in freezing assets of the richest woman in all of Africa, who got so rich by taking advantage of the Angolan people. This is how hard it is to expose the deep corruption embedded in Portugal's institutions and culture, you need to hack into football clubs' email accounts and be some sort of Snowden or Assange.

1099,"&gt;There is a reason why ocean disposal is prohibited: everyone starts dumping every shit into the ocean in the hope it sufficiently dilutes. It won't.

It will be just fine, the stuff already dumped just sits at the bottom. And even if it dissolved (thankfully it isn't simply water soluble), it would definitely be more than dilute enough to harm anything.

1101,"Alexander III of Macedon (Greek: Αλέξανδρος, Aléxandros; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia.

A member of the Argead dynasty, he was born in Pella—a city in Ancient Greece—in 356 BC. He succeeded his father King Philip II to the throne at the age of 20, and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Northeastern Africa. 

By the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.

After a short illness Alexander dies in Babylon in 323 BC. He has not named a successor, and his empire rapidly splits into warring factions. Eventually, several of his former generals establish their own kingdoms. 

He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.",,/r/europe/comments/nwjs6o/on_this_day_in_323_bce_alexander_the_great_dies/h19ghyr/,Vucea,1623319330

I don't think it is correct to say 200km/h is outright dangerous in general, because this is what A LOT of people drive everyday without any accidents. People from other countries often think this means total mayhem, this is just not the case. Driving on the Autobahn feels very safe compared to driving rural roads in Spain for example.

But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't implement a general speed limit. We could make the Autobahn safer and we should do it. I think on a sunny day 150km/h is totally fine but everyone who wants to go faster should go to the race track.

1204,"No, the French courts assune the ECJ has primacy.

The issue is that if country courts have primacy then the lawsuits in Poland and Hungary are null. It means individual countries can legislate away any EU law they don't like and claim constitutional supremacy. It completely dilutes the EU's legislative ability. 

&gt;By acknowledging the special nature of EU law and therefore giving it precedence over the French law, the CC expressly accepted the primacy of EU law, including the ruling of the ECJ in Costa (1964) (Dorani, 2020a).

&gt;Whereas the CE and the Constitutional Court were initially reluctant to review French law’s comparability with EU provisions due to their jurisdiction limitations, and consequently refused to accept the supremacy of EU law, particularly directives (Semoules, 1970; Cohn- Bendit, 1980). However, towards the end of the nineties, their views changed, and both accepted the supremacy of directly effective EU law as well as directives (Nicolo, 1990; Re Boisdet, 1991; Rothmans and Arizona Tobacco Products, 1993). Further, the Constitutional Court amended the Constitution so that sovereignty could be transferred in the new areas. Article 88 (1-4) was added, which expressly mentioned France’s membership of the EU being subject to the principle of reciprocity. The reasoning for the amendment was owing to the EU’s ‘permanent international organisations having legal personality and powers of decisions’ (Steiner, 2003: 79), which was similar to that of the ECJ in Costa  – an indication that the Constitutional Court accepted the ECJ’s jurisprudence.

1257,"from another comment:    


Finland, or France have the [same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiSrVLKZ-TA) plan.   
Considering that with 70% of nuclear (and record low [48gCO2/kWh](https://www.climate-transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/B2G_2019_France.pdf)), they only produce [2kg/person/year](https://aube.andra.fr/sites/aube/files/2018-03/plaquette_tout_savoir_sur_la_gestion_des_dechets_radioactifs.pdf) of radioactive waste, it seems reasonable to fix it properly in glass, in steel, in concrete, 400m underground. (especially compared to how we treat all the other nasties likes asbestos, lead, mercury, which our kids will only wished we treated with similar care)    

Have a look at how Mother Nature dealt with her [radioactive waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor).      


Now, about ""solving"" the waste problem.     
We all know it's dangerous, but the question is, what makes it dangerous, how much, and for how long?    
[This](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780081009628000159-f15-02-9780081009628.jpg) is the radiotixicity of used fuel (and its constituents) over time ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081009628000159)). hope you're familiar with double log scales.    
You'll notice that the original uranium ore has some level of radiotoxicity. I think we can agree that it is a good reference to keep in mind.    
Looking at the ""total"" curve, you can see the used fuel takes famously about 200,000 years to return to the level of the original ore.   
You may notice that among this ""total"", a large portion is from ""plutonium and decay products"". Were we to remove those, and the marks passes to about 10,000 years. Next large contributors are ""Minor actinides and decay products""; take those out, and your waste turns back to its original ore level in about 200 years.    

Now, it just so happen that plutonium can be used as fuel, so not only are you reducing the lenght and level of dangerousity of the waste, but you get low carbon electricity from it. Minor actinides can be separated and ""burned"" but they don't contribute to energy production.     

Shouldn't a ""solution"" to the waste problem be to extract and use those elements and reduce the volume, danger and lenght of dangerosity fo the waste? Shouldn't we invest in that? Shouldn't those who worry about nuclear waste be the most vocal about this?      
When can we expect such solution?    

answer: back in the 60's.       
They are called fast reactors.  
Worried about climate change and water resources issues? [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-350_reactor) is 26 years worth of low carbon electricity plus desalination in Kazakhstan in the 70's.      
France had [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superph%C3%A9nix) too, but those who care about the environment shut it down.     
Russia [never](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-600_reactor) [stopped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-800_reactor), they even now have the luxury of testing [different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-1200_reactor) [variations](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Russia-starts-building-lead-cooled-fast-reactor) for improvement.      
Now, don't you think that Russia, [India](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2020/oct/30/indias-first-prototype-fast-breeder-reactor-in-final-stages-of-commissioning-2217153.html) or [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFR-600) are closer to ""solving"" the waste issue than Finland and France (even the entire Europe, who recently [gave up](https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/features/the-astrid-nuclear-project-event-the-ghost-is-gone/) on even restarting the idea of investigating back what they already had)?     

Let that sink in: we knew of a demonstrated technology capable of turning 200,000 years waste into 200 years, and get low carbon electricity in the process, but prefered to put it underground. And those ""worrying"" about the waste were the most vocal against it.(could it be that they have no incentive, no political gain, for the ""waste issue"" to be solved?)",,/r/europe/comments/nwgpny/finland_might_have_solved_nuclear_powers_biggest/h199gn0/,233C,1623312798

1270,"&gt; The entire judicial response

There were a couple of cases over the last years where people at the age of 85 and older are brought to court for involvement from back then. The most recent one is about a 95 year old woman who worked as a secretary at the concentraction camp Stutthof near Gdansk. Another prominent case was John Demjanjuk who was extradited by the US and convicted in Munich in 2011. He was a guard at Sobibor camp and was convicted to 5 years of jail for assisting murder in 28.060 cases. He was 93 years old at that time.

You need to understand that German criminal law sets defined time spans in which a person needs to be brought to court within that time span. There is a defined time for every crime except two: murder and assisting murder. We call that ""Verjährung"" or say it is ""verjährt"".

One aspect why this comes up more often over the last years is that it seems, that certain archives became available where evidence surfaces that now connects certain people to working in those camps. On the other hand it seems as if some prosecutors offices want to pick up some cases again to make a statement.

Of course most of the people connected to those atrocities are already dead. But apart from the details in those archives, many of them could have been prosecuted decades ago. But they weren't. Many Germans wonder why they were left alone for decades but now that nearly all of them are dead, they charge close to 100 years old elders for assisting in murder.

Of course there's no other crime they could pull up. Because everything else is ""verjährt"" for a long time and it is basically impossible to pin an actual and specific murder to any of those left alive.

And many younger Germans see a pretty clear connection: There was no will to actually prosecute most of these people because if would have challenged the narrative of the German people being a victim of the Nazis, the narrative to separate ""the Nazis"" and the common people. Many leading bureaucrats in the young Federal Republic of Germany were former Nazi bureaucrats. Bundeswehr (Military) leadership, public prosecution, courts, the newly founded intelligence agencies, police, and many other public offices were staffed by former NSDAP members. And not only Germany. The whole US space prgram, and also parts of the soviet one, were based on German scientists. You think the US had put a man on the moon in 69 if we put Wernher von Braun on trial for the V2 program?

So they convicted the really bad bastards at Nuremberg, purged the leftovers of the upper leadership and let the rest know that they were needed to make western Germany the bulwark against communism, that it became. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. So as long as those people were still working in top positions all across the country, there was absolutely zero interest to start to uncover the misdeeds of the past.

Nowadays, those ""pioneers of a young democracy"" are mostly dead, there's only a few senile and broken 93- or 95-year olds who played no real role in anything. But sure, let's make a statement, that we will never again tolerate what happened back then and we will get you all and you will feel the rule of law! (Except when we need your expertise to defend against Russia or China or something, then we'll be all good. No biggie, right?)

It's all just an act, and those poor old people, who might have done some bad things, but we don't know how they got into that situation and what they might have tried to get away from it without being put to the wall themselves in the first place, have to endure it at the end of their lives. They now need to carry the burden of a country that found it's conciousness now that they no longer need the assholes of the past.

What could in any case not have happened is the Conservative Party winning an outright majority, which reduces the odds that a referendum would be held at all as this increases the odds that some other party has to be involved who opposes holding such a referendum.

1387,"But this is a very one sided way of looking at things, as you just looked for bad stuff in multi-ethnic states while ignoring the same stuff in nation-states.

For example Spain has a catalan separatist movement, but it's peaceful and quite small compared to the size of the catalan ethnicity. Valencia and the Baleares are catalan as well but they don't protest. So I don't see your problem. Of course separatists are not into unity, but they are peaceful. They don't genocide other spanish people.

And what's more interessting is what you think of a solution to the catalan problem. Ethnociding them and forcing them to become spanish or granting freedom to their case?

Because traditionally the ruling ethnicity of a nation state chose either ethnocide or even genocide the big minorities. To stay on topic lets look into Poland. How did it become mono-ethnic? Well you had a large scale ethnocide commited by the Poles on the Ruthenians (Rus, Ukranian, how ever you want to call them) makeing them Polish. The German wiped out the jews and socialist Poland forced Germans to leave.

So the creation of the mono-ethnic state is the result of wiping out the 3 largest minorities. Poland is no exception. For the large Part that's how large scale nation-states are created so don't let us get into fucked up shit like Germany, Japan, Spain (pre modern state) or France.

1409,"Oradour-sur-Glane, a village in Haute-Vienne, France, was the site of a particularly brutal atrocity - albeit a common occurence on the Eastern Front in occupied USSR - during World War II. The entire village was destroyed and its inhabitants killed by German troops (Waffen-SS) on June 10, 1944.  
  
In reprisal for Resistance attacks, an SS detachment of 200 men routed all 652 inhabitants from their homes and into the village square. A search for hidden explosives and an identity check were announced, and the people were herded off—the men into barns and the women and children into the church.  
  
The troops then barred the doors of the barns and the church, and with dynamite and incendiary devices they set fire to the entire village. Anyone not suffocated or burned to death was killed by machine-gun fire and grenades, except for 10 people who somehow survived the fire and feigned death until the SS had departed.  
  
The death toll was 642: 245 women and 207 children in the church and 190 men in the barns. Postwar efforts to bring the SS men to trial were hampered by the difficulty of locating and identifying the Germans, many of whom had been subsequently killed in action, and by legal complications. 

Finally, in 1953, 21 of the 200 SS men were brought to trial. All but one were convicted; five of them received terms of imprisonment and two were executed.

The fact that 1 wasn’t a good option is not the EU’s fault. The UK signed a treaty saying they wouldn’t have a border with a foreign country. That comes with a lot of baggage.

which later became the main vehicle of historical development. These

Good question. The answer is they would need to replace it with something else. At present there have been no alternatives tabled. Just moaning about what Brexit has caused and trying to pin it on the solution, the protocol.

&gt;This is not good for the EU. The wider EU will not want to blow up an already established treaty over NI. The EU is in a position where either they an lord a victory over the UK for 6 years, at which point they have to decide whether they want to enforce a border against the will of a member state, or come to a reasonable compromise where a little bit of NI-RoI smuggling will occur with no loss to the wider EU.

None of this was good for anyone. There is no lording s victory, the EU isn't trying to get one over on the UK or something. They want peace and a viable trade solution. The only thing that works is the sea border and N.I protocol.

The alternative is a land border and I don't think you understand the UK's position here. 46% of its exports go to the EU, 16.7% go to the USA (ONS - 2019 data).

All the more reason not to let the fucking virus in.

&gt; There will be others that will be even more so (one in Vietnam looks to be a contender).   If the Delta variant reaches New Zealand you will really be in trouble, because you are not wearing masks or social distancing and you are so far behind with your vaccination programme.

Yet more cluelessness - this is just embarrassing. Firstly, we are wearing masks in high risk places, such as public transport - that has been an ongoing requirement. We don't need to be socially distancing because - the country is COVID free. The protocols are put in place when there are border breaches, but these are few and far between. It's honestly just common sense.

Anyway, multiple cases of the India Variant have been stopped at the border (MIQ) already.  That's the advantage of having an extremely competent and experienced MIQ system.

Multi-ethnic states today have the huge disadvantage that they must constantly justify their own existence to their populous, either that or become authoritarian and suppress them.

Frankfurt as example was be stupid outside financial service as fintech or Tech is located through Germany. With Berlin playing the biggest and Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt playing bigger roles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also both Pillar are quite more complex and your shortening makes it sound wrong.

Pillar one:

&gt;The Pillar One proposals are intended to provide source/market countries  
 with increased taxing rights over certain multinational corporations   
operating automated digital services or consumer-facing businesses and   
replace various unilateral tax measures targeted at non-resident   
multinational corporations

Pillar two:

&gt;The GloBE proposal under Pillar Two would introduce a global minimum tax  
 (at a rate to be determined) to prevent the shifting of profits to   
low-tax jurisdictions.

Is the best sum up I found on English that still short and doesn't cut to much information.

[https://www.osler.com/en/resources/regulations/2020/oecd-releases-blueprint-reports-on-international-tax-reform-pillar-one-and-pillar-two-and-launches](https://www.osler.com/en/resources/regulations/2020/oecd-releases-blueprint-reports-on-international-tax-reform-pillar-one-and-pillar-two-and-launches)

&amp;#x200B;

To my understanding UK is going against both. As both work only connected and both were supported by the G7.

Also as you can see it's more of an international service tax against Mulitnational. A reason big Banks like HSBC were mentioned. Those would fall under those rules too. 

Killing Pillar one alone doesn't make sense. Especially since it targeted at countries, with non-resident multinational cooperation.  (Not the most realistic example) Ghana taxing HSBC for the profits it makes there, wouldn't change if UK is excempt from Pillar one. Meaning UK is not taxing HSBC for the profits it's makes their no matter where their HQ is.

Only if UK companies are Worldwide excempt from Pillar one or the whole Finanical service Industry. That would make sense, but is a gigantic concession.

Also only the first one would give the UK any advantage, but will probably never happen.

Pillar two is more about favoring multinational in their own country. As that would be again the race to the bottom.

As this is hear say and probably not much concrete I doubt we can and will pin it down on a pillar. 

As some media reported, they want to reduce it Inner London area, it seems pillar two is more likely, as pillar one is far harder to break down locally. But this is still all more hear say. 

But until the UK comes with a concrete proposal that will be guess work anyways. Also as this should be implemented World Wide, nothing is set in stone. G20 and OECD are the next for this reform to pass.

1827,"&gt; hey don't want it either. That's the whole fucking point. Ask the people.

Precisely my thinking. They should have a refurendum voting between 2 places to put the outside border - in Ireland or between Ireland and the rest of the EU.

&gt;The people that lived through ""the troubles"" are the last people on earth that want that back. Is that clear enough for you?

I really don't care where they out the border, as long as they put it.

Ireland would basically be choosing between maybe troubles or having their economy smashed up.

&gt;This isn't politics. It's people's lives that are at risk, direct risk, not financial risk but the threat of death. 

No it's about money. Ireland could put it between them and the EU - but they won't because it means they loose money. Instead they prefer all 400 million people loose money.

It affects me? I live in the inner market. I buy products. Everybody I know buys products.

1936,"&gt;In the verdict of the ECJ, it simply said that the ECB was right in their action as it was their right to act. So it didn't even look at the possible impact the ECB actions had on the financial policy of the country.

Yes, because there isn't any sure way to assess this. You could ask 10 economic Nobel prize laureates and get 30 different opinions. And you see this directly in the FCC decision as the FCC gives no systematic guidance on how to assess the proportionality whatsoever. So either the FCC has this knowledge and didn't want to share this with the world as they didn't want to get a Nobel prize or the they didn't have a clue either. 

&gt;And that is why the FCC overruled the ECJ, because in the eyes of the FCC, the ECJ must look at the overreaching results of the action. Just saying it has the mandate is not comprehensive enough.

No, the FCC says the CJEU should have assessed the proportionality and impact and should have made a final assessment. There is absolutely no way in doing this which leads to benefiting anyone. Having judges judge the impact and proportionality of monetary policy is in short nuts. If the FCC had any idea of how to do this, they would have proposed it themselves. 

&gt;So basically, the question asked by the FCC for the ECJ to answer was if there was an illegal impact on German sovereignty. The ECJ answered that the ECB had a mandate. Which doesn't answer _the_ question.

That's the bigger question but the leading question that the FCC wanted to have answered is about proportionality and final impact assessment. Good luck with that. 

So in the end the CJEU basically said that they can't check this (absolutely true) and the FCC said you have to check this but we won't tell you how (because the FCC shit for sure has no idea how to check this either).",,/r/europe/comments/nvnnrg/eu_prepares_legal_action_against_germany_over_ecb/h16k5s5/,Pyromasa,1623262138

If the UK isn't interested in having a frictionless border with Ireland, then the border can't stay open in the same way as it has been pre-Brexit, or Ireland will have to leave the EU. It's the two choices Ireland have without the UK onboard.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I mean, do you even understand the largest opposition to that is from Ireland (and the Republicans in NI), not the UK - plenty of people in the UK, especially among conservatives, would actually be happier with that.

Yeah, it's been my thought this entire time that UK conservatives care so little about what happens on Ireland, they'd rather wait for Ireland to leave the EU instead of fixing this problem themselves. They had no problem throwing Northern Ireland under the bus...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But this entire thing where people just shrug ""then we'll just bin the Good Friday Agreements"" is illustrative of my point - one wouldn't expect Greeks, Hungarians, Germans, Poles, etc, to even understand the issue.

But you do. Even though the Protestant countries were most witchunt-eager, and mostly did so from XV to XVIII centuries, while Lithuanians had to deal only with Orthodoxy and later Roman Catholicism.

However, if you truly believe in paganism, you should also believe in pagan witch power. Which means that people can be justified in defending themselves from witchery, like they defend themselves from murderers or robbers.

if you don't believe in pagan witches, what watered-down paganism it is then.

2006,"&gt; You need to have more than two braincells to connect the dots and see connection between Turów, NS2, German anti-nuclear stance and so on, it's of course bigger than Poland, but we are important part of it. I doubt you are able for such intellectual effort.

Yeah, not going into your conspiracy's. Everybody is in it, safe for the altruistic energy company and the main shareholder, neither of which would have any interest in continuing this mining operation if there were any concerns about its safety or impact - i get it.

&gt; Nonetheless with the screen being built Turów is as good as any other mine, probably even better

Which PGE and the polish government have failed to prove to the extend they are required. Even if it were the best screen ever the issue does not revolve around the screen and its claimed ability to reduce the negative effects on the surrounding area to an acceptable level alone.

&gt; The Czech aren't also complaining about their own mines, which I think affect more Czechs than Polish mines. Or am I wrong?

Because non of the complaints on this case apply there? Because the Czech Citizens have political impact on the government regulating the mining operations and compensations? Because the Czech mines pay Czech taxes which are used to cover some of the damages caused to the Czech citizens? Because people in general have less issues with such mines in their neighborhood if they have an economical benefit instead of having to burden the issues only?

If Czech citizens have doubts over the legality and effects of their mining operations they can call their courts, same as the Germans did in the case of Jänschwalde. The inability of the Czech and German citizens of the area around Turów can not, which is literally one of the main complaints the European Commission had in this case:
&gt; [...] in the context of the procedure prolonging the mining concession for the Turów lignite coal mine, the Commission considers that the Polish authorities have incorrectly applied the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (2011/92/EU) and access to information Directive (2003/4/EC), as regards information to the public and Member States involved in transboundary consultations, **access to justice**, as well as the principle of loyal cooperation enshrined in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU).

2007,"I'm confused as to why you don't think the examples in the article are ""actual real life"" examples.

The articles do indeed bring up several topics, and the work/life balance is a separate one and should not be confused with the male/female work value topic, though the articles deal with both. Of course the work/life balance contributes to the problem... but it is a distinct issue. It's not the one I am addressing. (Though it's certainly worth considering, if we WANT people doing unpaid labor of taking care of kids and the elderly, what can we do to encourage that, should pensions be the average of married people's salaries and they get the same amount or something, but that's a whole other conversation)

And of course as you point out there are certainly instances when women get better deals, particularly in places where they are sought after for diversity reasons. I'm talking about overall trends as pointed out in the research, though.

Thank you for bringing up the hard number vs percentages point, let me clarify, the theory is that when the PERCENTAGE in a field of women is higher, pay goes down, and the percentage of men is higher, it goes up.

Where are you getting that private school teachers are paid more? Generally in the US it is the reverse, as private school teachers are not unionized, and the trade-off is that private schools accept less pay for better overall conditions (no need for a license, naughty kids can get kicked out, overall feeling of school community, etc).

I wondered if it had changed recently, but a quick google suggests it has not. There may be some individual private schools that pay more, but generally public schools offer better compensation

I think that a better way for all this to have gone would have been the EU and UK to come to the following agreement during the Brexit deal:

* UK commits to a in-or-out referendum for NI within the next N years.

* If NI votes to remain with the UK, then the RoI commits to holding a referendum to leave the EU within the next N years.  If they vote to remain, the RoI commits to withdraw from the GFA.  If they vote to leave, then UK commits to facilitating a customs arrangement with the RoI.

There are three possible outcomes:

1. NI votes to leave the UK.

2. NI votes to stay in the UK, and the RoI votes to leave the EU.

3. NI votes to stay in the UK, and RoI terminates the GFA.

This is never gonna make everyone perfectly happy, but nothing is.  And it has some admirable characteristics:

* Every outcome has democratic legitimacy backing it.  People may not agree with a given outcome, but in each case, at the lowest-reasonable political unit, a majority chose the outcome.

* It's clear what the implications of the decisions are.  Policy isn't written via loophole.

* In all outcomes, the customs issue is resolved.

My guess is that in practice, with the current Brexit deal, effectively #3 is what's going to happen, just without any democratic legitimacy and way more misunderstandings and bitterness than if people had voted on the matter.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/nvwsag/eu_threatens_to_suspend_parts_of_brexit_agreement/h162mxt/,duisThias,1623255115
2096,"&gt; Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis and his business empire may be among the first cases investigated by the European Union's new joint prosecution after a referral from national authorities, a top Czech prosecutor said on Wednesday.

&gt; Babis is a billionaire who has transferred his Agrofert conglomerate of firms in farming, chemicals, food and other sectors - many receiving EU subsidies - to trust funds, but an EU audit has concluded he was still in control of the property.

&gt; The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) launched its operation on June 1, led by Romania's former anti-corruption chief prosecutor Laura Koevesi, and is due to take over serious cases which involve EU funds.

&gt; An investigaton by EPPO would be another headache for Babis who faces a tough election campaign over the summer and a separate protracted criminal investigation at home for alleged EU subsidy fraud.

&gt; High Public Prosecutor Lenka Bradacova confirmed to Reuters the case, overseen by her office, was being referred to EPPO.

&gt; ""The criminal case... generally referred to as a conflict of interests of the prime minister, falls under the sphere of action of the newly established office (EPPO) due to the description of the act and its legal classification,"" she said.

&gt; Babis has vigorously denied any wrongdoing and said he had met all legal requirements by moving Agrofert to the trust funds. He has blamed the opposition Pirate Party, which filed the original complaint, for pushing the case for political benefit.

&gt; A Czech representative to EPPO also confirmed to Reuters that the case was flagged by the Czech prosecutors for referral. A spokeswoman for Babis did not have a comment available.

&gt; Agrofert was the biggest single recipient of EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) funds in 2018 and 2019, paid per hectare or per animal, at over 29 million euros ($35.4 million)each year, according to an analysis by the CEPS think tank.

&gt; Babis's firms have also received development subsidies from EU-backed project financing, which are normally approved by national authorities and later claimed for reimbursement from Brussels.

&gt; A European Commission audit released in April focusing on projects, not CAP payments, concluded he was in conflict of interest and should not have received the funds. The funds under scrutiny, worth millions of euros, had not yet been reimbursed from the EU budget.

&gt; Babis also faces a separate criminal investigation at home for allegedly hiding the ownership of a firm that developed a conference centre outside Prague so it would get a 2 million euro EU subsidy meant for small businesses.",SPQE,/r/europe/comments/nvvfwo/czech_prime_minister_may_be_among_first_in/h162noy/,DerangedArchitect,1623255123

I've lived in the US.  They are very attached to their national anthem and it is played before every sporting event (not only international competitions).

Kaepernick's protest was to refuse to rise, because he felt he couldn't honor a country where the killing of unarmed civilians happened frequently.

Racism is certainly a problem in European football but I feel like this gesture, when removed from its context, doesn't have a lot of meaning.

2269,"Maybe the problem is that Dutch cities are simply too dense and crowded if there isn't enough space for either cars (did feel a lack of parking) and green spaces (agree, really aren't that many).

On the other hand aren't cars just a cleaner and better replacement to horse carriages that existed and dominated in cities pretty much the whole time since cities have formed. There were generally serious problems with horse carriage traffic  and their ""exhaust"" manure even before cars, especially when cities grew dramatically during industrial revolution and became too large to just walk around.  I think cars ethically Okey and even if not the cheapest transportation option they still shouldn't be a luxury.

Parking can probably be built underground (no one is going to live there) and as Dutch you can probably control the water. While roads would still have have to be kept for emergency services, firefighters use pretty large equipment.

Overall acting against people's will just doesn't sound right in we live in a democratic society where people should be listened to and if we make exceptions this becomes an argument to forcefully implement something in other areas of our life.

Overestimation of how difficult it is to use public transportation exists, know some people who haven't used it for decades but it isn't difficult or expensive to test your views. They gave a chance a few times and still decided it is unpleasant experience being surrounded by so many people in such a small space, stand the whole time and don't have control over the music, AC or safe permanent storage places. While others have faller in love with buses because they maybe already disliked driving or searching for a  parking spot.

People use cars, cars are tool for people to bicycles, buses, metro, trams and so on. They move people and goods. Forcefully making car usage not an option or miserable sounds like an unfair repressive environment for those who rely on them. And it would be done so just some people who live in expensive and crowded city center can enjoy utopian environment?

 There is a natural equilibrium for car, public transportation and cycling/walking. It is exactly forceful control over people's life without listening to others opinions and democratic solution  if someone decides, no, you can't use car, but there also isn't efficient and comfortable alternative (which is in some situations not possible). 
You make equal conditions for all types of transportation and leave and option for everyone to use whatever they find the most comfortable and attractive.

Planes are not just cheaper than trains they are way cheaper, often even a few times, they also are way faster. However they do create pollution, but they don't have to damage with their tracks serene or protected environments, don't divide natural animal habitats and environments. New train tracks, especially high speed ones are constantly surrounded by fences and likely scare animals more than planes.

Now it is a strong argument that cars pollute cities but we shouldn't forget that it will become irrelevant in the near future with electric cars (yes, 20-30 years is the near future).",,/r/europe/comments/nvov2w/one_of_haarlems_lovely_neighbourhood_the/h156ckr/,googleLT,1623240577

There you go. Though fair warning, it is behind a very significant paywall (for a real time financial database, go figure). 

I am not arguing fossil fuels in general, we have the ability to phase out everything but gas currently (and should really do so). 

&gt; Peaking fossil fuel plants are so expensive that eliminating them with peaking nuclear plants is economically viable.

I have no clue where you're getting this from, and it just isn't true. 

The primary cost of running a traditional power plant (or a gas power plant as I am specifically arguing here) is fuel costs, meaning the cost of running the plant and the amount of energy a flexible plant are strongly correlated (and so is CO2 emission for that matter).

Unlike the nuclear powerplant where the primary costs (in both money and emission) are construction and decomissioning, while the fuel costs are very low. This makes them excellent baseload providers (though the neccesity of baseload is debatable) but god awful at providing flexible energy. 

On top of all that, nuclear power is already so expensive that it is commercially unviable without *heavy* state subsidies.

Correct. In democracies the people have the final say about the adjudicator.

But this is also the reason why the EU should never force the people to make a choice between who the primary adjudicator of disputes should be, as that will divide the people.

First and foremost, because in Germany, the federal constitutional court is one of the most trusted entities. It outclasses the ECJ by leagues.

But secondly because dividing the people by forcing them to answer such a question is the very opposite of the European Idea of unifying the people, as it forces EU citizens to answer the question if they are first and foremost and EU citizen or Germany citizen (in my case).",Germany,/r/europe/comments/nvnnrg/eu_prepares_legal_action_against_germany_over_ecb/h14vpwk/,Alcobob,1623233052

Of course, many leaders are so selfish that they only work for their own profit, but that's another story. It just happens that the inherent selfishness of larger countries has an impact on more people and more countries. Why is Germany more selfish than France or Poland for example?

One big problem is that most do not understand that improving the living conditions of ALL humans would even benefit those that already have a good living. But that is universal and true for all countries.

Remember the refugee crisis? Or overall refugee problems? Every single country doesn't want to take care of those poor souls. A selfish act of all.

Because of the surplus of our export? I would really like to know this.

Just claiming that because of the stupid Nord stream (i hate that thing, I'm a German btw) feels a bit shallow.

I also have problems with this export surplus. Germany mainly exports technology products. Machines, tools, cars, whatever. But so many ppl seem to need or want that stuff. So much so that we export more stuff than we need to import to fulfill most needs and desires. My economic understanding is way too little to make a good statement, but seen as someone relatively naive in the field, we would have to cull some of our industry that produces stuff others want? I really don't get it and would love some details or links to respective articles. How can this really be adjusted?

The EU might implement checks on states which divert in standards or does not follow the implementation of agreed upon rules.

If they were to make border checks on Ireland because of British lack of implementations, it would be similar to implementing border checks on other member states because of a lack of checks by the russians. Basically the EU would open up a door of allowing its internal market to be affected and adjusted by thirdparty nations, this would damage the integrity of the market and therefore will be seen as a serious threat of which will be meet with a joint force by the whole of the EU.

It's less a practical thing, as it is a big deal politically and a sign of weakness of solidarity and a lack of following of agreed upon rules. The whole strength of NATO (to make an example) is the rule that an attack on one of the members is an attack on all the members. If this was played down or in a case, not followed through, the rule would not have the massive effect it has today. Same with the market and membership in the EU, if members are sacrificed, or rules are bent, the whole club structure will be weakened and it's members might make their own policy adjustments in spite of the agreements.

2. Of course Zittau is affected. There is a giant hole in the ground next to it (but there is also old German mine on the other side of the town, which also contributed to the damages), but the mine is moving away from Zittau, so there won't be any additional damage. And the current damages are limited by the screen built in 1980s.

3. Of course it's standard. But Opolno-Zdrój and Białopole won't be destroyed. Only northern part of Opolno-Zdrój will be, but people already moved away from there.

The EU is by design in a very awkward position. Some things are left unclear on purpose because otherwise the EU couldn't even exist.

Let's talk about the 2 extremes:

A: A nations constitutional court has the last say: This leaves us with a case where member countries could have constitutional courts controlled by the ruling party, which can block any EU laws it doesn't like from adoption into national law, leaving the EU as a dysfunctional patchwork of different laws.

B: A nations constitutional court is bound by verdicts of the ECJ: This leaves us with many countries in the EU that cannot formally become part of the EU, as it was illegal to do so. As i'm German, i know Germany couldn't.

So the best case is for things to remain undecided. So both national constitutional courts and the ECJ can claim primacy in the specific case, but they have to do so very carefully in regards to the bigger political picture and overriding each others rulings happens very rarely happens.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/nvnnrg/eu_prepares_legal_action_against_germany_over_ecb/h14nlvg/,Alcobob,1623225793

2407,"Romuald Rajs, nom de guerre ""Bury"" (30 November 1913 – 30 December 1949), was a Polish soldier and anti-communist insurgent. Rajs was a member of Home Army (AK) and National Military Union (NZW).

In 1946 the unit under his command burned several Belarusian villages in the region of Białystok and massacred about 79 villagers.

In January and February 1946, Rajs' unit ""pacified"" six Belarusian villages, murdering 87 civilians and wounding dozens. In Zaleszany, Hajnówka County his men locked civilians in a building and then burned them alive. While the motivation for these actions is not entirely clear, it is known that it was not accidental.

During January 1946 Rajs' unit captured forty horse cart drivers near Łozice. Those drivers who declared themselves Polish were released, while the remaining 29 were shot near Puchały Stare. The unit then went on a killing rampage in the villages of Zaleszany, Wólka Wygonowska, Zanie, Szpaki, Końcowizna, Popówka, Rajska, Sypnie, and Potoka, killing an additional 50 people. These killings were condemned by the NZW itself, which intended to court-martial Rajs, however this ultimately did not happen

He was sentenced to death in a show trial held by the Polish communist government in 1949, charged with membership in delegalized NZW. Following the trial, he was executed in 1949.

Like with many other anti-communist partisans, his death penalty was nullified by the Military Court of Warsaw in 1995.

The colored parts were once sea. We build very long dikes in that sea and pumped all the water out, which left us with a lot of land.

The main goals ware flood protection and more land for agriculture.

It is correct for what i said. The German constitution has primacy in Germany.

Doesn't mean that other entities are not allowed to make judgements (lower courts) in their specific field.

I know, which is why i said that previously (2nd line). So what's your point? That the German citizens want the EU to be a true federation today and would vote so in a referendum?

I don't think the EU is stupid enough to force Germany into a position where the citizens have to decide between ""EU becomes federation"" and ""Germany leaves the EU"".

New German-French tensions have begun to emerge over the war in Mali. From the beginning, Berlin and Paris have had a division of labor. Whereas France assumes the military engagements (Opération Serval, and later Opération Barkhane), Berlin dealt with the stabilization of the country, on the one hand, within the UN's MINUSMA framework and on the other, training Malian troops within the EU's EUTM Mali framework. Meanwhile both have failed - Paris, due to the fact that jihadi militias in the Sahel cannot be defeated militarily, and Berlin, because the Malian troops - in spite of the training programs - are committing massacres and putsches. (german-foreign-policy.com reported.\[9\]) ""Fighting terrorism,"" the way it is being done in Mali is a ""dead-end street,"" writes SWP for example. The realization that one is ""fighting a losing battle in the Sahel"" is spreading.\[10\] Paris is being criticized as a ""difficult partner."" In public, the clearly looming defeat is being blamed, to a growing extent, on France.

Also, need to notice, that after the First World War there was the Second.

2626,"The Battle of Toulouse (on June 9, 721) was a victory of an Aquitanian Christian army led by Duke Odo of Aquitaine over an Umayyad Muslim army besieging the city of Toulouse, and led by the governor of Al-Andalus, Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani.

Arab historians agree that the Battle of Toulouse was a total disaster for the Arabs. After the defeat, some Umayyad officials and soldiers managed to escape, among them Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. However, the clash halted indefinitely the Umayyad expansion northwards. Al-Andalus was at the time re-organising into a new post-Gothic order. The Umayyads kept the military initiative raiding several times the south of Gaul (up to Autun in 725), but avoided new serious campaigns into the north-west.

Odo's victory earned him widespread renown in Aquitaine and recognition abroad, he came up reinforced. He was hailed as champion of Christianity by the Pope in Rome.

Some authors have called the fateful engagement the Balat Al Shuhada of Toulouse; others attach that name exclusively to the Battle of Poitiers (Tours). According to Meadows, it would be still remembered in memorials by Al-Andalus Muslims for the following 450 years, as opposed to the Battle of Poitiers, held as a battle smaller in scale.

Some historians believe that the Battle of Toulouse halted the Muslim conquest of Europe even more than the later—and more celebrated—Battle of Tours (10 October 732, between Tours and Poitiers), but this is highly problematic: for even had the Arabs won at Toulouse, they still would have had to conquer the Franks to retain control of the region.

However, nearly all historians agree that the Christian victory at Toulouse was important in a macrohistorical sense in that it gave Charles Martel badly needed time to strengthen his grip on power and build the veteran army which stood him in such good stead eleven years later at Tours.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/nvn276/9_june_721_odo_of_aquitaine_defeats_the_moors_in/h1468xx/,filosoful,1623212695

Nobody said that. You're acting if there's this kind of binary: Either you take ""Pride in your ancestry"", or there is no such thing (""no roots, no history, based on total indivualism with no nationalistic pride""). I literally pointed out that there are tons of things like pride in your countries achievements, pride in the high quality of life, pride in it's functioning democracy, pride in it's social institutions, which can all be inclusive and shared with others. Even pride in your ancestors achievements works, as people can share in those. None of these are based on your genetics, but on the opinions, culture and values of people.

Yet one thing that doesn't? Pride in your ancestors. You specifically said that, ""Pride in your ancestors"". Not pride in the achievements of your ancestors, pride in your countries history or even pride of the countries current status, but pride in your ancestors. Pride in your ancestors, pride in your genetics. ""Yea, I descend from a purely Aryan family. It is something I truly cherish. What? You are mixed? Oh.

In terms of FDI value I think the UK will probably be somewhere between 2nd and 5th, the Netherlands and Ireland usually top the chart as companies shift taxable profits through them to avoid taxes elsewhere, and Germany, France and the UK all receive similar FDI and swap positions regularly year by year, then the difference is so great between the top 5 and those below that I can't see it any lower than 5th.",,/r/europe/comments/nv80j5/france_most_attractive_country_in_europe_for/h12ykve/,Tamor5,1623190148

There is 0% chance that the US would agree to a complete ban.

That's not what this is about. This is about seeing a significant humanitarian problem evolving with their use, and establishing international norms that would forbid or restrict certain uses that are incompatible with human rights. What would that accomplish? Probably the same thing the ban on biological and chemical weapons and on land mines accomplished. Not 100% compliance, but fairly close.

I think not, it is composed from having a common origin, a common language, a common name,  common traditions and common culture (including dress, architecture, art etc), usually a common religion. But concerning the Roman Identity, one also needs to add a common dedication towards the statehood of Rome, and in general, to be Romanized/Hellenized, to have a communion in the Greek-Roman Civilization.

All of the above are present in Modern Greece, but also to a great extend to Modern Italy as well, albeit in a lesser manner. The Modern Greeks have a national identity that is a direct continuation of the Medieval Roman Greek, and from them to the Ancient Roman. When they revolted against the Turks, they did so knowing that it was a Roman Revolution, and their purpose was to restore the Roman State as it was before it had collapsed.

Yes so they did 91.3% or possibly more. Glad we agree.

&gt;Oric, for one, walked due to ""lack of evidence"" (as stated in the document you'ev sent). Gotovina also got out on a technicality (range of shells or something).

Look at Italy: we had to put a technocrat in charge, and for the first time in ages, the press isn't trying to tear the government to shreds.

No, I can't accept it, if that wasn't clear. Seselj was found not guilty as well at one point. I couldn't accept that either. The ICTY works with limited evidence and walls of silence, and many people get away. If Mladic didn't have 50 cameras pointed at him, he could have claimed ""he didn't know"" and gotten away with 5 years or something.

Let me ask you a question, why did morocco bomb civilians if the saharawi people (who used to be nomads) wanted to become moroccan, why did it expelled them from their homes and gave them to moroccan colonizers? Because the schizofrenic fantasy of ""the great morocco"" doesn't care about the identity of the people living in a certain area is just an imperialist fantasy, that is also why morocco claimed mauritania for much of its existance, why morocco went to war with algeria for some sand (and was terribly humilliated) and why morocco insists on claiming the ethnically spanish  cities of ceuta and melilla, and even the canary islands.",,/r/europe/comments/nukdwa/morocco_vs_spain_why_it_matters_for_the_eu/h12361r/,Atromb,1623176451
3198,"When you have designated a minister in your government that defend the police institution in every situation despite all the problem it has, that is able in the public TV channel to say to Marine Le Pen that she is too soft and don't go far enough, you can be right to ask yourself wome questions.  
And some law he supported does not help much :

* 30 October 2017 - law of internal security in fighting against terrorism
   * Put the rights for the police and government available only in case of an urgency into the common law. Meaning reduction of right during a police intervention for everyone else.
   * This law was used to forbid some protest.
* 30 July 2018 - law regarding protection of secrecy of business
   * it has a lot of grey area open to interpreation
   * Every journalist institution were against the law
   * two example of the use of the law :
      * When a lawyer of an association of people who have thryoid diseas asked the naitonal agency of medication and health products data about the Levothyrox
      * Second time the same agency refused to give a newspaper the list of certified implants certified by the European Union.
* 22 December 2018 - law regarding the manipulation of informations
   * During electoral period, they can stop a news if :
      * The ""falseness"" of the news is verified
      * OR it's broadcast in a massive and artificial way
      * OR is a trouble for the ""public peace"" or harm the sincerity of the election
   * SO MANY GREY AREA
   * As you can guess, journalists were not happy about that one either

And some other laws he is supporting or supported :

* in May 2020 he tried to pass a law that forbid the broadcasting of a police intervention if it could permit to identify police officer that did the intervention. It was modified due to being censored by the constitutional counsil to just forbid the private data collection concerning police officer which is not framed by the law.
* Right now, the law regarding separatism, which, by the word of the minister that proposed the law , is ""to act against things made on the fringes of the Republic, against the Republic and with the goal to undermine it"". You can see the Star Wars vibe on this one.

On the wrong hand all those law could be disastrous. And they are not necessarily popular among the ""left"" (well, they are authoritarian).",Pays de la Loire (France),/r/europe/comments/nv3qv0/france_president_emmanuel_macron_slapped_in_the/h1236d1/,Nizla73,1623176455

3219,"&gt;No two articles one of them provided by you. Which are peer reviewed and have hard data. Your claims don't even have sources outside of a blog post. Until now your sources undermined your own argument.

I gave you a Wikipedia article providing my point but I guess it doesn't exist if it doesn't fit your narrative.

&gt;Ok but you are claiming they are an entire different ethnicity ( whatever that means) , that is disproven by the article and the fact that germanic immigration in Italy was of a minority of warriors. 

The article mentions the genetic genepool present from Romans in Italy, not that they're 100% the same as they were. *Sight* again, it was warriors AT FIRST, Germans eventually settled in making a genetic mix significantly influenced by Germans.

&gt;Holy shit, I don't think you understand what the HRE was like. It was a feudal decentralized system, the fact that it was controlled from modern day Germany has basically no relationship with the genetic makeup of the inhabitants. The emperor barely ever saw Italy, and when he saw it it was because some city rebelled until in 1177 or so it ended up having zero power in northern Italy. 

I know all that, you really underestimate what you need to graduate from history.
The HRE was ultimately run by Germans, with Austrians ruling over northern Italy, both during the HRE and as part of the Austrian Empire before Piedmont reclaimed it. If you don't want to understand how the HRE works, (it's a little more complicated that a decentralised state) use Austria as an example of German straight up conquering northern Italy.

&gt;Ok, because you speak of Race exactly like my American (from the USA) boyfriend does. However you see race it is pretty alien from my understanding of it. And that is normal it is highly culturally dependent. 

I never talked about race, I talked about ethnic groups, mixes and the genepool. 

&gt;I am the only one that actually provided sources so far. No the blog post whose sources underlined your argument doesn't count.

You completely ignored my Wikipedia article, you do not understand neither my sources nor yours and you kind of forget most of what I know comes from school and I don't think you can read Spanish.

&gt;No it does makes a difference, your entire argument is that Germanic blood made them ""white"" and an entire different ethnicity. If the Republican Roman clustered togheter with C/N Italian than would not be the case, at least for what Italic Romans are concerned.

Again, white is subjective, but for modern terms, Romans originally weren't. The Germanic blood brought Italians, over time, over centuries after the collapse of the Roman empire, into being considered white as of today's usual definition. It didn't made them a different ethnicity, as they're still Mediterraneans, but it instead brought Italian Mediterraneans into being considered white.

3285,"&gt;I know all that, you really underestimate what you need to graduate from history. The HRE was ultimately run by Germans, with Austrians ruling over northern Italy, both during the HRE and as part of the Austrian Empire before Piedmont reclaimed it. If you don't want to understand how the HRE works, (it's a little more complicated that a decentralised state) use Austria as an example of German straight up conquering northern Italy.

Holy shit you know nothing. The HRE was a feudal system. It was run by local lords that sweared to the emperor. It didn't last until the unification of Italy, the german part was destroyed by Napoleon and stopped having any importance after Frederick the second during late 1700. And the Italian part was no longer under the HRE already in 1177 after the treaty of Venice when northern Italian cities became entirely autonomous after the war between Milan, the Lombard league and Barbarossa. Whatever was your specialty or you studied it was definitely not European history ( which is entirely fair) but don't pretend to know much about it. You seem completely miss the fact that nation-states simply were not a thing back then.

I instead think that sounds like boh and uffa are ugly and ridicolous haha not the meaning, the sound specifically.

Boh means i don’t know (and sometimes even don’t know and don’t care), beh is like well, in northern italy we use also bon as well, like the french. Uffa is like french uff, when you are tired of something.

It seems you know italian by what you write..

I’m sorry i wrote bad things about french, but it is true: lots of french words do look like italian without the ending vowel, i think it’s a linguistic phenomenon. And french is nasal and with the uvular r. It’s not bad, since i think the majority of the european languages aren’t that good sounding, so french stands out because it sounds less ugly than some others (for example the slavic languages, pardon). Modern greek also sounds nice.

I used the mechanic metaphores because of my father, he knows a lot of mechanics. In fact i fear sometimes redditors think “why this girl with the rapunzel pic knows about the fiat 127 with the third door that everyone copied” while it’s because i asked my father.

If it’s a matter of languages, art or music, it is instead flour of my bag.

No, the opera continued indeed because the french weren’t able to find a better alternative at the time, but when Lulli came the effect was not a deleting of the italian opera in france, but simply a creation of a french style, more sober, less abstract and virtuosistic and more descriptive and dedicated to the word. This was due to french general descriptive tendence, to Lulli’s lack of immagination (he was really intelligent and understood the french, but the author of my book said he wasn’t really talented)  and to the fact that virtuosistic bel canto is not adapt to the french language.

Often opera singers on reddit say they have a hard time singing in french because it is difficult to do a high note with a nasal sound.

Another fun fact: in england there were protests against the italian opera too, from the intellectuals, to complain the fact that operas for the people were done half in italian, and the brit public wanted to get them all only in italian because by understanding nothing they could even relax and turn their brain off more and force less their brain.

3313,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca#Etymology

&gt;The term lingua franca derives from Mediterranean Lingua Franca, the pidgin language that people around the Levant and the eastern Mediterranean Sea used as the main language of commerce and diplomacy from late medieval times, especially during the Renaissance era, to the 18th century.[15][7] At that time, a simplified version of mainly Italian on the east and Spanish on the west side of the Mediterranean including many loan words from Greek, the Slavic languages, Arabic, and Turkish came to be widely used as the ""lingua franca"" of the region, although some scholars claim that the Mediterranean Lingua Franca was just poorly used Italian.

&gt;In Lingua Franca (the specific language), lingua means a language, as in Italian, and franca is related to phrankoi in Greek and faranji in Arabic as well as the equivalent Italian. In all three cases, the literal sense is ""Frankish"", leading to the direct translation: ""language of the Franks"". During the late Byzantine Empire, ""Franks"" was a term that applied to all Western Europeans.[16][17][18]",,/r/europe/comments/nv3fk8/french_set_to_replace_english_as_eus_working/h112tl1/,MonitorMendicant,1623161072

So if Russia annexes Belarus it is a PR nightmare, if it tries to remove Lukash it is a PR nightmare (who put him there in the first place?), if it abandons Belarus then the EU would have no interest in dealing with Lukash too, but would see Russian interference in any attempts to remove Lukash out of spite.",Belarus,/r/europe/comments/nv3rw3/lukashenko_designates_day_of_soviet_invasion_of/h1140j4/,Ulixex,1623161601

I won't be keeping these versions up to date but you can see how the data is entered and calculated. 

**Version Notes**

The ecdc stopped updating data on a daily basis as of 14th December. I figured weekly data wasn't particularly useful and while the worldometer data is not as accurate as an official agency, at least it is daily so people can make informed decisions about it. 

Just so you can see the extend of the variances, here is the data for the 12th, 13th and 14th of December between worldometer and ecdc: https://imgur.com/Y71Nx7o

Some of this will be due to delays in data reporting and methodologies, others will be the source. In order to do a more detailed comparison, you need to look at the data sources on the ecdc and worldometer sites.

The good news is that worldometer data allows me to look wider than just the UK and EU and also has up-to-date testing data, which allows for the positivity data to be more useful and match the case data in terms of time frame. 

I've added vaccination data as of 23 March 2021. This data is sourced separately and is also not always fully up to date - as such, there's a column which includes the data date. Note that I will be reporting as per the data collected by ""Our World in Data"". 

**Schedule**

I will post this chart daily (where possible) during the week, Monday to Friday but I will not update it at weekends because around half of the countries do not update their numbers over the weekend and also it's on a computer I would not otherwise be logging onto, unless there's something particularly notable which requires a weekend update.

**Explaining some numbers**

*What is the 7 day case rate?* 

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The 7 day case rate number in the graph is the number of people in that stadium who would have a coronavirus infection a week later. For example, in the UK on the 8th November the number was 239.7. That means 240 out of 100,000 people in the stadium would have an infection the following week.

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the daily movement*

The daily movement numbers are just how the 7 day case rate is moving up and down each day. The 7 day trend is the most interesting number - it's the sum of all the ups and downs. If you think of the infection as a car then the 7 day case rate is the speed of the coronavirus infection and the 7 day trend is the acceleration (or deceleration) of the infection. If the 7 day trend is red it's accelerating, if it's neither red nor green it's holding steady and if it's green it means it's slowing down (note - a green 7 day rate doesn't mean the infection is shrinking, just that it's slowing down).

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*How can I tell if the infection is shrinking*

You can't infer that from this data, this data only looks and new cases and the rate of change in new cases. The other side of the equation is how many people are recovering from coronavirus in each country. If you think of it like a bath - this is how much water is flowing through the taps. You cannot tell how much water is going down the plughole so you can't tell how much water is in the bath (i.e. the infection level).

*What is testing rate per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The testing rate is how many of those 100,000 people will have received a coronavirus test in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the positive test rate*

This is the % of tests taken which are coming back positive. The WHO says countries should aim for this to be 3% or lower and that testing not keeping up with infections if the rate is above 10%. If you don't have enough tests, you restrict access to them to people who are more likely to be infected either by their symptoms or their risk of exposure, and that inflates your numbers.

This number is a ratio of tests completed, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 3% adjusted case rate*

Used to be the 10% rate but has been rebased around 3%. There is also a lower limit at 1% where the impact will be reduced by a factor of 5. 

Countries with a higher positivity rate are not testing enough of their population, so this multiplies their most recent day's case rate by a factor of their positivity rate divided by 3% - for example on 6th April Greece's positivity rate was 6% so their daily case rate was multiplied by 6%/3% = 2

**This is not** an estimate of the true scale of the pandemic within the country** but is a proxy to rank countries by accounting for countries who are showing a lower positive case rate because they're not doing enough testing.

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing within a country, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 7 Day Vaccines per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it. This is the number of people in the stadium who would have received a vaccine dose of that stadium in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 1st Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received their first vaccine dose. It covers total population which includes children so will be lower than the number some sources cite (% of adult population)

*What is the 2nd Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received all of their vaccine doses to be considered vaccinated (includes single dose vaccines like J&amp;J)

**What are the marks out of 10**

A formula gives every country a score between 1 and 11 for how bad their 10% adjusted case rate is and multiples it by the 1st dose %. The higher the better. 

For the graph on 22nd March, Estonia, at the top of the chart, gets a score of 1; Iceland, at the bottom of the chart, gets a score of 11. Everybody else gets a score somewhere in between. It then multiplies this by 2/3 of the total doses of vaccines given. Since no country has a vaccine rate greater than 90% it is effectively a score between 1 and 10.

What does it mean? It's a score as to how well the country is managing the pandemic - when the score gets close to 10 this means they have very low infection rates and very high vaccination rates. 

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing AND vaccine rates within a country, so you can compare country-by country

**Why sort by the 10% Adjusted Rate?**

Look at Poland on 9th November as an example - their actual 7 day rate was not actually much higher than the UK's (200 vs 160) and is lower than Denmark's (221), but their positive test rate is 49% - basically 1 out of 2 tests came back positive compared to 5% for UK and 2% for Denmark. Poland only test a fraction of their population compared to the UK or Denmark (706  vs 3198 / 8658 per 100,000) so their actual rate of infection is going to be much higher - their 7 day rate is just kept artificially low by the amount of tests they're (not) doing.

The 10% Adjusted Rate accounts for this. 

This method is **not perfect** as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may alter the way they account for things. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing, remember that it's not perfect and doesn't tell the full story. 

There is no one unbiased source and you should seek to get your information from a range of sources and assess the underlying bias in the information you're reading and the possible agenda that source may have.

**Why is X country not on the list? / Why is this EU-centric / There are non-EU countries above the total**

I originally did refer to this as EU rather than Europe and I had a lot of comments from people about their country being in the data but them not being in the EU. So I removed any reference to the EU. Since then I've had increasing numbers of comments about why this is EU-centric. To be clear - countries above the grey line aren’t just EU, the reason they’re above the line is because they were the countries tracked by the ecdc which was the original source of the data.

Since December I’ve had to switch to using worldometer as the ecdc only provide weekly data. As such I added a small basket of additional countries but I added these below the line, because I wanted the data to be comparable for people looking pre- and post- ecdc data. The countries in the basket were those most commonly requested. The only limitation I have is that I need to be able to fit the screenshot on one page. The total number of lines available is 41, so I don’t have enough lines for all 48-51 European countries (depending on where you draw the line on Europe and which states you recognize). 

Regardless of how I cut this, it seems it’s going to annoy somebody. But if you have a country that you feel should be represented that isn't and there's enough demand for it, I'm happy to see what I can accommodate.","British, spiritual EU citizen in exile due to Brexit 🙁",/r/europe/comments/nv2icw/7_day_case_rate_positivity_rate_and_vaccination/h10p94z/,sonicandfffan,1623153990

This seems to be a typical Reddit strong statement based on emotion, not fact.

Now, what does ""does not give a fuck"" mean?  Perhaps that Germany isn't interested at all into returning the art. I mean, in the same way as Russia ...  (since 1998 there is a russian law that WW2-stolen art belongs to the Russian state, not the individual owners. It is actually two way, it doesn't differentiate between the art that Russia stole and the art the Germany stole).

* Source 1: https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/bundesregierung/staatsministerin-fuer-kultur-und-medien/kultur/rueckfuehrung-von-beutekunst
* Source 2: https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/tid-31992/diplomatischer-eklat-in-st-petersburg-merkel-fordert-rueckgabe-der-beutekunst-von-russland_aid_1022817.html

At an exhibition of russian-stolen art in St. Petersburg in 1995 Putin even said that ""we should both stop asking for returning of stolen art"". So Russia clearly doesn't want to pursue this issue further. (Source: 2nd link from above). Which is puzzling, because when there was still an east-german FRG, Russua returned some stolen art to the GDR. But not to West-Germany, or citizens in West-Germany.

Now, Germany has a policy in effect since 2014 (why so late?  This really isn't good!) to return stolen WW2-art to their owners. So claiming that Germany doesn't give a fuck at all is quite incorrect. You can claim it's overly bureaucratic, slow, whateven. And you'd be probably not be wrong. But you blew up too much, into the domain of being factual wrong.

However, returning art is difficult. Some reasons:

* the art market is shady, to say the least. These arts are often very expensive, and a lot of people claim to be owner (via inheritance) that aren't really. Just to see how shady it is, look at how Gustl Mollath was able to buy stolen art, see https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustl_Mollath --- would Germany freely and quickly return art to anyone that claims ownership then it wouldn't be good either
* some countries (see Russia from above) claim that all of this art is state property. So we cannot return these art into Russia: the real owner would still be robbed.

So, all in all: Germany has a procedure to return stolen art. This procedure is IMHO way too slow, but it exists. Many other countries don't return their stolen art at all. There is entirely too much stolen art from ancient Greece, Egypt, from the WW2 area in private hand and museums, and few countries are actually willing to return art. Some museums in Berlin, Paris, St Petersburg and London would probably be half-empty. Still, from time to time returning of stolen art from colonial times happens in [Germany](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/rueckgabe-benin-bronzen-101.html). But: if returning this makes a big headline, then it's entirely too seldom. It should happen on such a regularly basis that the news wouldn't bother to report on it.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/nt6i6c/namibia_genocide_mbumba_says_germanys_payment_is/h10iz43/,holgerschurig,1623149227

to the state old-age pension scheme (known as AHV), which proposes to   
raise the retirement age for women from 64 to 65 – **in line with that of**   
**men** – and increasing VAT.

So the [average life expectancy](https://www.statista.com/statistics/974697/life-expectancy-at-birth-in-switzerland-by-gender/) for men in Switzerland seems to be 81.9 years and for women 85.7 years.

The more satellites you have, the more accurate you get. 
The atomic clock itself is a key component also and it needs to be very accurate, that has been the main stumbling point. However recently new atomic on chips suitable for space have arrived. They are not as accurate but the added number of satellites mitigates it. 

Also, the closer the satellites are, the more accurate it is and a stronger signal.

So yes it can be done, it will be done and it will be available a lot sooner than you realise.

If you migrate to Africa, would you expect the locals to forget about their ancestry and pride so you can feel better included? Because if you do, you shouldn't migrate anywhere at all. If someone chooses to migrate, they know it comes with the risk of having no roots in the country. Building a country with no roots, no history, based on total individualism with no nationalistic pride leads to a society where everyone is a stranger with everyone else, no sense of civil duties or companionship, because we're all strangers.

3803,"The Lindisfarne raid was a Viking assault in 793 on the island of Lindisfarne (Holy Island) off the coast of what is now Northumberland. The monastery at Lindisfarne was the preeminent centre of Christianity in the kingdom of Northumbria. The event sent tremors throughout English Christendom and marked the beginning of the [Viking Age](https://imgur.com/a/75BY6pJ) in Europe.

The raid at Lindisfarne at the end of the 8th century was not the first Viking incursion into the British Isles. In an entry for the year 787, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports the arrival of “three ships of Northmen” on the coast of Wessex, a band of foreigners who promptly killed the local reeve when he came to conduct them to the king. Additionally, a Kentish charter from 792 indicates that defensive measures against “pagan seamen” had been taken in the kingdom of Mercia.

However, the attack on Lindisfarne in 793 was the first recorded Viking raid in England and in Europe more broadly, and its importance is signaled by the strange incidents that accompany it in the historical record. The events of the year are described thus in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle:

Here were dreadful forewarnings come over the land of Northumbria, and woefully terrified the people: these were amazing sheets of lightning and whirlwinds, and fiery dragons were seen flying in the sky. A great famine soon followed these signs, and shortly after in the same year, on the sixth day before the ides of January, the woeful inroads of heathen men destroyed God’s church in Lindisfarne island by fierce robbery and slaughter.

While the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle indicates that the raid occurred in January, it is now generally accepted that the actual date must have been June 8. Given the testimony of other sources and considering the fact that spring is a more favourable season for coastal raiding, the given date probably represents a scribal error.

The description of the attack itself is brief—the chronicler says only that the church was destroyed, goods were stolen, and blood was shed—but the famine and the portentous signs that are noted preceding it point to the seriousness of the raid from the Anglo-Saxon perspective.

The event is elaborated on in a number of other medieval sources, such as the 12th-century chronicle Historia Regum (History of Kings), commonly attributed to Simeon of Durham. The author claims that the pagan invaders “laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted steps, dug up the altars and seized all the treasures of the holy church.” He continues to describe how they dragged many of the brothers of the monastery away in fetters and drowned others in the sea.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/nuvujc/8_june_793_vikings_raid_the_abbey_at_lindisfarne/h0zt903/,filosoful,1623125157

The EU has failed even in basic things such as agreeing to protect two of its members, Cyprus and Greece against visible and tangible external threat.

The EU OTOH failed to mount a strong statement to protect its own external borders and its own EEZ.

Certainly. The article does not say what the PM said, nor what Kiev said, and skips completely the context. Kiev was voting on sanctions because Russia invaded their country. At this point gas delivery to Ukraine was halted for few months. They chose not to do it. It had nothing to do with gas prices. 

&gt; And here is an article about the Ukrain actually stopping gas transits in 2009

capitalists - in this case meaning the actual capitalist class - abhor war. it strips them of market opportunities and, even worse, runs the risk of having their business capital (be it plant or workers) destroyed. 

on the heels of WW2, the EU was always intended to be an exercise in preserving the ownership class in europe by confederating away intra-european war; singing kumbayah and having the continent become ""more european"" was not ever an intent of the endeavor in the way that the United States, for example, sought unity to avoid international conflict (i.e. getting reconquered by Britain in the future)

then since the fall of the USSR, the aims of the EU shifted to expansion to serve the triple purpose of a) providing massive market opportunities for european conglomerates b) providing an absolute ton of cheap and wage-depressing iron curtain labor for those same firms and c) providing new capital investment and revenue opportunities to offset moribund national domestic consumption partially on account of the progressing rot of dynastically entrenched wealth (not income) inequality in ""old"" europe. again, the prime motive here is to create a system intended to benefit the capital aristocracy. 

then, in the 21st century it took on a fourth dimension: providing an entirely new superstructure to generate bureaucratic employment as a component of the welfare state. this is, again, done in service of capital so as to ingratiate the population to the existence of ""Europe"".",,/r/europe/comments/ntlzm8/a_shortage_of_workers_is_driving_up_wages_in_the/h0zlwj2/,phenixcitywon,1623121004

Definitely not, considered that Czechoslovakia used similar move to gain/regain this land in 1919, while Poland was fighting Bolsheviks. Or in 1945, when they sent panzer train and some forces to Kłodzko-Nysa region, claiming this land as their own.

Such were tragic times of XX century, when empires collapsed and countries re-gaining independence pushed and shove, to gain as much as they could. I never considered dirty moves of Czechs, to be alliances with Bolsheviks or Nazis and one shouldn't make same assumption about Polish dirty moves. USSR and Nazi Germany had a proper alliance, supported each other and conducted many joint-parades with one another. Poland had no pacts with Germans, was not a part of Munich agreements and never intended its forces to stand even remotely close to Wehrmacht. But indeed, they used most dumb situation, to gain something out of it.

&gt;europeans are too different

Culturally? Sure, I agree, Europeans are very diverse.            
But that doesn't mean a federation won't work. 

A federation doesn't mean the federal government decides everything and everyone has to follow one set of rules. That's the beauty of a federation: a lot of power can stay at the state-level.

But let's go back to the conversation we were having:       
Voting on the Commission presidency/Council presidency directly would mean reducing state sovereignty and limiting power and say of states in what the EU does. Do you think that's a good idea?

Norway police say body on shore is Kurdish-Iranian boy who died in Channel

Police in Norway have said a body found on the country's coast earlier this year is that of a missing 15 month old who died in the English Channel.

The child, named Artin, died along with four family members when the boat they were travelling in sank in October.

The Kurdish-Iranian family had been attempting to reach the UK from France.

Relatives of the family have spoken of their grief and confusion as they waited to hear what had happened to Artin.

Now the child's remains will be flown back to Iran to be buried.


On Monday, police in Norway said the body had been found on the country's south-western shore near Karmoy by two officers on New Year's Day.


""We didn't have a missing baby reported in Norway, and no family had contacted the police,"" Camilla Tjelle Waage, the head of police investigations, told the BBC.

""The blue overall wasn't a Norwegian brand either [and] that indicated the baby was not from Norway,"" she added.
A DNA profile was then obtained and the family were notified that it was in fact Artin.

""Skilled professionals in the department of forensic sciences at Oslo University Hospital managed to retrieve matching DNA profiles,"" the police statement said.

The boat carrying the family sank in the Channel on 27 October. Rasoul Iran-Nejad, 35, Shiva Mohammad Panahi, 35, Anita, nine, and Armin, six, all died.

The family were from the city of Sardasht in western Iran, near to the border with Iraq.

Fifteen other migrants were taken to hospital and an investigation into the sinking was opened in Dunkirk by the French public prosecutor.
Nihayat, the second aunt of Artin, was the first relative Norwegian police spoke to. ""I'm both happy and sad,"" she told the BBC on Monday. ""Happy that Artin's remains were eventually found, and sad that he left us for good.""

Shavin, the child's aunt who lives in Switzerland, said she wanted Artin to be ""reunited with the rest of his family"". She said they would complete the required paperwork so Artin's remains could be returned to Sardasht.

Shortly after the sinking, the BBC saw a series of text messages believed to have been sent by Ms Mohammad Panahi, including one that acknowledged the danger of crossing the Channel by boat but concluded ""we have no choice"".

""If we want to go with a lorry we might need more money that we don't have,"" a second message read.

Another said: ""I have a thousand sorrows in my heart and now that I have left Iran I would like to forget my past.""


media captionBilal Gaf, who spent time with the family, said Artin had been 'famous' in the camp
At a camp in Dunkirk, another refugee, Bilal Gaf, said the family stayed close to his tent for three or four days before they left, and described Artin as ""famous"" among those staying there.

""He was a very happy baby,"" he said, showing photographs of himself with the child, taken around 10 days earlier.

""People are sad, but what can we do? Nothing. Just cry.""

Thousands of Iranian-Kurdish refugees put the lives of their families in the hands of smugglers and go to Europe every year.

The Kurdish region in Iran has faced both political persecution and vast economic disparity.

Between 25 and 35 million Kurds inhabit a mountainous region straddling the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia.

Toddler whose body washed up in Norway drowned in Channel last year - police

A toddler whose body washed up on the southwest coast of Norway on New Year's Day has been identified as a boy who died with his family while trying to cross the English Channel, Norwegian police said on Monday.

Artin Irannezhad, who police said was 18 months old when he died, drowned along with four family members when their boat sank while trying to cross to Britain from France in October.

His body, clothed in a blue overall and life jacket, drifted across the North Sea to Norway and his remains washed up in the municipality of Karmoey.

""The boy who was found is Artin Irannezhad. He is of Iranian origin and disappeared during a shipwreck in the English Channel off the coast of France on Oct. 27,"" Camilla Tjelle Waage, head of investigations at the sheriff's office in Karmoey, said in a statement.

""Both parents died, as well as Artin's two older siblings who were found dead after the shipwreck. The rest of the family have been notified.""

Thousands of migrants attempt to cross into Europe each year by land and sea from North Africa, the Middle East and beyond in search of a better life, often taking huge risks and paying large amounts of money to people smugglers.

Norwegian police were able to confirm the identity of the toddler by matching his DNA with that of a relative close enough in lineage who happens to live in Norway.

""This story is tragic, but at least it's good to be able to give the relatives an answer,"" said Tjelle Waage.",,/r/europe/comments/nudz41/toddler_whose_body_washed_up_in_norway_drowned_in/h0y8el3/,Writing_Salt,1623097184

&gt;China has an economy 10 times bigger than Russia's.

And it's entirely our fault, our companies outsourced labour and manufacture to China  and China, in return, has stolen our technology (proven so many times it's undeniable at this point) which helped China grow into what it is today. Imagine if we did to Russia what we did to China, imagine Putin being the leader of the 2nd largest global economy on the world projected to be #1 within the decade. XI ji Ping has already set his eyes to invading a part of India and the entire Taiwan island and he has surrounded himself with like minded people who will continue his war mongering tendencies once he is gone however China will by then be the biggest global superpower, not just #2.

While America can be a very good country to make money in (which I never disputed), the inequality issues are very tangible there). For example, I’m a mortality analyst. Low earners in the US are an anomaly in the western world because their life expectancy is falling (particularly women) due to factors like opioids. That’s before we look at the insanely high crime statistics or the debt people take on to get an education or healthcare. I went to college with several relatively wealthy Americans in Ireland. They have to pay much higher fees than EU citizens but it was still cheaper for them to be sent here for college than to go in America so their parents sent them here. House size is a silly metric as it reflects cultural differences as well as land availability. I could list off much more important measures such as life expectancy, reported happiness and risk of poverty where European countries come out on top. Working conditions are also far superior in Europe. I work for a large multinational and paid paternity leave for the European offices is twice as long as maternity leave for the US offices (maternity leave is about 10x longer).

Same thing here :( A lot of professional players from older generations had stories about growing up playing on frozen ponds or maybe an indoor rink at their towns community centre, no matter what their financial background.

Nowadays if you want any chance at making it as a professional your parents have to spend thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars throughout your childhood enrolling you in leagues, taking you to tournaments, etc. I have a cousin who went to a private boarding school just for their hockey program (which has produced a good number of professional players) but that's obviously out of reach for the vast majority of people.",Quebec flair when,/r/europe/comments/nu6trt/youth_of_czechoslovakia_a_propagandistic_glimpse/h0x8veu/,Tachyoff,1623082250

4491,"Yes that makes sense. It's just a paradox situation, if you say ""Yeah you can operate your business legally, but we will punish all your customers, so maybe better operate below our radar if you want to find customers"". The quality of customers you will get is only criminals willing to put up some criminal energy for sex. The intersection between people who are willing to put up criminal energy for sex and rapists is probably quite high. So, I see legalization of both parties, strict controls and education (not all men want to ""rent"" women for sex, also if it's legal, you can achieve this by teaching them to respect women) are promising ways to reduce illegal human trafficing and forced sex work and lower the risk for the sex worker. But I am of course not an expert, just saying that only legalization without proper education probably won't solve the problem, as your study suggests, but I think with a change in society, like only stigmatizing and prosecuting illegal customers, who go to not registered sex workers, could better the situation of many people. For example in Germany, when you qualify because of an disability, your insurance will pay for a prostitute because we think Sex is something everybody has a right to, if he finds somebody (legal) willing to do it, and should not be punished. So many people are lonely, sometimes my ex was just booked because somebody wanted company on a Sailing Trip, a Marathon, or just to cuddle and talk and have somebody who treats them special, even if it's just an illusion you paid for.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ntl5su/prostitution_in_europe/h0x998x/,NealCassady,1623082415

(the reason most jamborees are from wealthier countries, is that those countries have more resources to host better camps.) Maybe the scout Organisation at your country/state is different and problematic but all in all the scouts have a really positive effect on the world. There are still problems with the scouts, especially locally in some countries. As an example that the US scouts are separated into boy and girl scouts (although the boy scouts accept girls now bcs the girl scouts are shit). Many scout orginisations are too patriotic, religious and obedient/hierarchical for my taste, but they are patriotic and religious in Bangladesh too.

Still the scouts were allways against social classes as an example. For respecting nature. For helping others as default and not expecting praise for it.",,/r/europe/comments/nu6trt/youth_of_czechoslovakia_a_propagandistic_glimpse/h0wtaw4/,enjoy_free_kill,1623075472

Tsikhanouskaya’s participation in the unveiling ceremony of the monument in Warsaw, organised by Rafał Trzaskowski and attended by many active opposition politicians, did not please Ryszard Terlecki, the head of the PiS parliamentary caucus.

Terlecki, on Twitter, criticised the Belarusian opposition leader. “If Tsikhanouskaya wants to promote the anti-democratic opposition in Poland and attend the meeting sponsored by Trzaskowski, let her seek aid in Moscow”, she wrote.

I won't be keeping these versions up to date but you can see how the data is entered and calculated. 

**Version Notes**

The ecdc stopped updating data on a daily basis as of 14th December. I figured weekly data wasn't particularly useful and while the worldometer data is not as accurate as an official agency, at least it is daily so people can make informed decisions about it. 

Just so you can see the extend of the variances, here is the data for the 12th, 13th and 14th of December between worldometer and ecdc: https://imgur.com/Y71Nx7o

Some of this will be due to delays in data reporting and methodologies, others will be the source. In order to do a more detailed comparison, you need to look at the data sources on the ecdc and worldometer sites.

The good news is that worldometer data allows me to look wider than just the UK and EU and also has up-to-date testing data, which allows for the positivity data to be more useful and match the case data in terms of time frame. 

I've added vaccination data as of 23 March 2021. This data is sourced separately and is also not always fully up to date - as such, there's a column which includes the data date. Note that I will be reporting as per the data collected by ""Our World in Data"". 

**Schedule**

I will post this chart daily (where possible) during the week, Monday to Friday but I will not update it at weekends because around half of the countries do not update their numbers over the weekend and also it's on a computer I would not otherwise be logging onto, unless there's something particularly notable which requires a weekend update.

**Explaining some numbers**

*What is the 7 day case rate?* 

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The 7 day case rate number in the graph is the number of people in that stadium who would have a coronavirus infection a week later. For example, in the UK on the 8th November the number was 239.7. That means 240 out of 100,000 people in the stadium would have an infection the following week.

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the daily movement*

The daily movement numbers are just how the 7 day case rate is moving up and down each day. The 7 day trend is the most interesting number - it's the sum of all the ups and downs. If you think of the infection as a car then the 7 day case rate is the speed of the coronavirus infection and the 7 day trend is the acceleration (or deceleration) of the infection. If the 7 day trend is red it's accelerating, if it's neither red nor green it's holding steady and if it's green it means it's slowing down (note - a green 7 day rate doesn't mean the infection is shrinking, just that it's slowing down).

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*How can I tell if the infection is shrinking*

You can't infer that from this data, this data only looks and new cases and the rate of change in new cases. The other side of the equation is how many people are recovering from coronavirus in each country. If you think of it like a bath - this is how much water is flowing through the taps. You cannot tell how much water is going down the plughole so you can't tell how much water is in the bath (i.e. the infection level).

*What is testing rate per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The testing rate is how many of those 100,000 people will have received a coronavirus test in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the positive test rate*

This is the % of tests taken which are coming back positive. The WHO says countries should aim for this to be 3% or lower and that testing not keeping up with infections if the rate is above 10%. If you don't have enough tests, you restrict access to them to people who are more likely to be infected either by their symptoms or their risk of exposure, and that inflates your numbers.

This number is a ratio of tests completed, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 3% adjusted case rate*

Used to be the 10% rate but has been rebased around 3%. There is also a lower limit at 1% where the impact will be reduced by a factor of 5. 

Countries with a higher positivity rate are not testing enough of their population, so this multiplies their most recent day's case rate by a factor of their positivity rate divided by 3% - for example on 6th April Greece's positivity rate was 6% so their daily case rate was multiplied by 6%/3% = 2

**This is not** an estimate of the true scale of the pandemic within the country** but is a proxy to rank countries by accounting for countries who are showing a lower positive case rate because they're not doing enough testing.

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing within a country, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 7 Day Vaccines per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it. This is the number of people in the stadium who would have received a vaccine dose of that stadium in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 1st Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received their first vaccine dose. It covers total population which includes children so will be lower than the number some sources cite (% of adult population)

*What is the 2nd Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received all of their vaccine doses to be considered vaccinated (includes single dose vaccines like J&amp;J)

**What are the marks out of 10**

A formula gives every country a score between 1 and 11 for how bad their 10% adjusted case rate is and multiples it by the 1st dose %. The higher the better. 

For the graph on 22nd March, Estonia, at the top of the chart, gets a score of 1; Iceland, at the bottom of the chart, gets a score of 11. Everybody else gets a score somewhere in between. It then multiplies this by 2/3 of the total doses of vaccines given. Since no country has a vaccine rate greater than 90% it is effectively a score between 1 and 10.

What does it mean? It's a score as to how well the country is managing the pandemic - when the score gets close to 10 this means they have very low infection rates and very high vaccination rates. 

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing AND vaccine rates within a country, so you can compare country-by country

**Why sort by the 10% Adjusted Rate?**

Look at Poland on 9th November as an example - their actual 7 day rate was not actually much higher than the UK's (200 vs 160) and is lower than Denmark's (221), but their positive test rate is 49% - basically 1 out of 2 tests came back positive compared to 5% for UK and 2% for Denmark. Poland only test a fraction of their population compared to the UK or Denmark (706  vs 3198 / 8658 per 100,000) so their actual rate of infection is going to be much higher - their 7 day rate is just kept artificially low by the amount of tests they're (not) doing.

The 10% Adjusted Rate accounts for this. 

This method is **not perfect** as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may alter the way they account for things. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing, remember that it's not perfect and doesn't tell the full story. 

There is no one unbiased source and you should seek to get your information from a range of sources and assess the underlying bias in the information you're reading and the possible agenda that source may have.

**Why is X country not on the list? / Why is this EU-centric / There are non-EU countries above the total**

I originally did refer to this as EU rather than Europe and I had a lot of comments from people about their country being in the data but them not being in the EU. So I removed any reference to the EU. Since then I've had increasing numbers of comments about why this is EU-centric. To be clear - countries above the grey line aren’t just EU, the reason they’re above the line is because they were the countries tracked by the ecdc which was the original source of the data.

Since December I’ve had to switch to using worldometer as the ecdc only provide weekly data. As such I added a small basket of additional countries but I added these below the line, because I wanted the data to be comparable for people looking pre- and post- ecdc data. The countries in the basket were those most commonly requested. The only limitation I have is that I need to be able to fit the screenshot on one page. The total number of lines available is 41, so I don’t have enough lines for all 48-51 European countries (depending on where you draw the line on Europe and which states you recognize). 

Regardless of how I cut this, it seems it’s going to annoy somebody. But if you have a country that you feel should be represented that isn't and there's enough demand for it, I'm happy to see what I can accommodate.","British, spiritual EU citizen in exile due to Brexit 🙁",/r/europe/comments/nu7ejd/7_day_case_rate_positivity_rate_and_vaccination/h0vzpiu/,sonicandfffan,1623054367

4892,"&gt; Isn't this just ""consent but with more steps""? Basically they imply consent where there was no physical resistance.

It's not the same, no. The old definition considers the same kind of sexual assault to be a less serious crime than rape if there is no *physical* resistance to it. The problem is that we do not apply this standard to any other crime. Other crimes are defined by the actions and mental states of the perpetrator, but for some reason when it comes to rape, most jurisdictions require the victim to fight it off *physically*, and if not then the perpetrator is considered to have done something less morally reprehensible or nothing wrong at all.

Researchers interviewed 2,769 Europeans representing varying demographics. Questions ranged from whether they’d prefer to vote via smartphone all the way to whether they’d replace existing politicians with algorithms given the chance.

51% of Europeans support reducing the number of national parliamentarians and giving those seats to an algorithm. Over 60% of Europeans aged 25-34 and 56% of those aged 34-44 are excited about this idea.  
  
On the surface, this makes perfect sense – younger people are more likely to embrace a new technology, no matter how radical.  
  
The study found the idea was particularly popular in Spain, where 66% of people surveyed supported it. Elsewhere, 59% of the respondents in Italy were in favor and 56% of people in Estonia.  
  
In the U.K., 69% of people surveyed were against the idea, while 56% were against it in the Netherlands and 54% in Germany.

However, in these times the polish government decided ""Lets get what we can get (probably to fix their economic issues) and not gamble on a better future"".

And yet Poland agreed to the negotiations back then (and then twice later).

However, there is are teo big question: if greed now says ""Oh, this isn't enough, and our negotiations from back then are null and void"" ... which current amount would then be ""enough"" ?  And, second question, how could one know that a new negotiation wouldn't be voided by greedy people again in, say, 25 years?

My guess is that you just see Germany as the milking cow.

And that you're coward. Where is your country asking other countries that did bad to you for reparations (e.g. the russians that still occupy your ex-territory)?  Where are the poles paying reparations for their own wars?  Certainly in 1000 years of history the poles made LOTS of attacks to neighbors?  Or, while it's absolutely unquestionable that way more germans did war crimes to poles ... where are the reparations of the poles for their own war crimes? You guys think you're the one exception that didn't do war crimes at all?  (Unfortunately, it's mostly right-wing sides that list them, and I want to put a link to any one of them. However, that there have been done a few polish war crimes is unquestioned amongst historians).  Where are the reparations of Poland towards ancestors of jewish people because of polish collaborateurs (there were a lot of polish anti-jewish people in Poland back then!).

""He who is without sin throws the first stone"" comes to mind ...

2. affordable energy supply: German energy price is one the most expensive in Europe if not the most expensive. Green energy are not profitable if not heavily directly or indirectly subsidized (the price is fixed above market price beforehand and the production is guaranteed to be sold).

5081,"The pagan holiday was repurposed by Constantinople when he converted to Catholicism and naturally, as Emperors would, required everyone in his empire to convert to Catholicism as well. So taking holidays they were already used to like winter solstice celebrations (birth of the sun celebrating days getting longer) and changing them to Catholic holidays (birth of the Son of God) was a less difficult way to get the masses aboard— which is why people still setup Evergreens in their home and worship them by decorating them at Christmas time— it has nothing to do with the Bible, it’s just a carryover from the original pagan ritual. Historically, Jesus was born sometime around March, but we celebrate it at in December because it was an easier sell. 

Same with Easter taking place at the Spring Equinox which was originally a big pagan fertility ritual where people would offer sacrifices (some cultures actual blood animal sacrifices, while others offered plants— humus and mulch and compost which they would use to fertilize the soil with) in hopes that they would have fertile landand lots of rain for a good crop that year. The Catholic Easter mass is full of phallic symbols and fertility rituals like taking a HUGE Paschal candle and plunging it into the water of the baptismal font as well as decorating the altar with spring flowers and plants— they just simply replaced the animal blood sacrifices with the figurative sacrifice of Jesus being crucified, as they refer to him as the Lamb of God.

5160,"&gt;Religion is a cancer.

Very cool that they secularized society by oppressing religious people and killing church bishops. In the first five years, they executed 28 bishops and over 1200 priests. 

&gt;Atheists waged a 70-year war on religious belief in the Soviet Union. The Communist Party destroyed churches, mosques, and temples; it executed religious leaders; it flooded the schools and media with anti-religious propaganda; and it introduced a belief system called “scientific atheism,” complete with atheist rituals, proselytizers, and a promise of worldly salvation. But in the end, a majority of older Soviet citizens retained their religious beliefs and a crop of citizens too young to have experienced pre-Soviet times acquired religious beliefs

Krakow is famous for its rynek (town square) because it's original, but as a result it's super touristy. If you can get shown around the actual local nightlife by a local, it's great, but anywhere near the centre is pretty crap. That said, the salt mine just outside is mind blowingly cool.

Wroclaw was bombed to buggery, but rebuilt. It's not original construction, but as a tourist you wouldn't be able to tell. The vibe of the town square is much more pleasant, and as an absolute tourist, I actually preferred it. Also, there's these great little gnomes everywhere!

Problems with immigration, do everything you can to halt immigration altogether. Problems with China, tariffs that hurt American companies.

5528,"&gt;Sure, you need to leave room for development and you can't plan for everything, but it's part of the job

No its not part of the job. The job shouldn't exist, for the most part, in the first place. It's like saying: ""yeah lots of people die under a repressive authoritarian regime, but that's just part of a the job of being dictator."" Uhhh, no there should be no dictator. 

&gt;Imagine, people already thought of this, you didn't invent anything new. 

I've written more about the sociology of planning [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OurRightToTheCity/comments/lui0f5/draft_examining_antidialogical_action_in_urban/).

&gt;Why do people want to pay the insane prices per square meter in New Belgrade?

There is always a lot of demand to live in the capital. There's overregulation in developed nations that prevents the housing market from meeting demand like it used to. The inefficient use of space in New Belgrade doesn't help. 

&gt;The best part is what you are pulling out of your ass about efficiency, what are you talking about?


Do you believe you can plan a forest better than it can grow itself? Do you think you can pump the carbon into the tree, and remove the carbon through the leaves? Do you think you can feed the hawk 1 squirrel a day, and feed every squirrel 10 nuts, and decompose a carcass by yourself? Do you think a forest is a machine? It's not, and a city is the same kind of natural system as a forest. If you tried to manufacture a forest out of metal and gears, you would fail, or at least come up with something robotic and inefficient. Cities are the exact same way: they are not machines, they are natural systems that are most efficient(with few exceptions) when left to their own devices.

&gt;What are your metrics?

- in addition to the point above in a legal country people will also be more likely to report cases, where human trafficking is suspected, which in return will ofc let the numbers go higher

- moreover this does not take into account the regulations the specific country takes against human trafficking and how hard this stuff is controled 

- another important point would be the big unknown number of actual trafficking cases in illegal countries, so the actual numbers might not be that different


The points i mentioned are merley points i thought of whilst reading so i cannot give u a source, these are only speculations.




The article also is a speculatative argumentation on the specific theories from each side, but these are theories and whilst one can say, that a model can be used which is based upon the article and its stans upon the theories, no hard evidence underlines this, which even the author states and also says that further research is need to come to a final conclusion.


And for my conclusion, whilst prostitution and the correlating number of human trafficking can increase in a legal country, it must not neccesarly, it depends on the location, its specific laws upon prostitution and immigration and the controling of said prostitution Businesses and the nations borders.

I also find it wrong to ban prostitution, just bc some criminals are using it for profits, its not the fault of the business, but that of the criminals.

For a metphorical example: i think everybody knows the book ""mein kampf"" (hitler). Just bc hitler is using a book for his own interests and profits, doesnt mean that every book should be banned. What should be banned is hitlers book (correlating to human trafficking) and the overall regulation of the market should be controlled (correlating prostitution market), thus lowering the spreading of the book.

Now i am tired and gonna go to sleep, so if u leave a reply the earliest answer will be tomorow.",,/r/europe/comments/ntl5su/prostitution_in_europe/h0tixdm/,666Ruler,1623003610

5589,"Top-down planning and planning for cars go hand in hand. Cars require top-down planning and dont naturally exist in emergent urban systems. They are probably the second biggest problem in planning. The first biggest problem is the authoritarian attitude inherent in urban planning that allowed such terrible designs to take hold in the first place. There are plenty more inefficiencies with the process that just aren't as noticeable. Urban planning itself is the root of the problem and its powers should be rolled back significantly. 

&gt;Meanwhile, while lack of planning has resulted in some good cities, they usually only became actually nice to live in once some level of planning was introduced. Cities in Europe were terrible, terrible places to live up until the early or even middle 20th century.

I think that there are definitely some measures that planning can improve that organic urbanism doesn't possess(like utilities, PT). However, I think the more important part of the problem was poverty, and that exists whether its in a soviet bloc or a packed street. Density is not the problem, overcrowding is. 


I would agree with your time argument but, in practice, housing never gets built fast enough by top-down, highly-regulated institutions. This is why there is a housing shortage across the post-industrial developed world, since bureaucracy is a strong force in these societies. For instance, Brazil, which is famous for its strong squatters rights, has HALF the per capita homelessness rate than the US despite having less than 10% of the wealth. It is actually much faster if you allow the people to build. If you want to set up some social housing in the meantime, I'm all for it, but it isn't a permanent solution.",,/r/europe/comments/ntfjn5/belgrades_first_skyscraper/h0tjbh7/,404AppleCh1ps99,1623003794

I think that the main problem with these estates wasn't architecture, but rather demographics. In some countries, they made them places for the poor and socially disadvantaged, so they turned into social and racial ghettos with everything that entails.

In Yugoslavia, they were meant for everybody, so we avoided that trap and they were never ghettos, but we had a different unforeseen problem: it was generally young families with very small children that moved in into a block when it was finished, so there was no good generational mix. This made them great family places for the first 10 years, then turned them into a gangland full of delinquent teenagers ruining life for everybody for the next 5-10 years, and then slowly into a sleepy place full of middle-aged and old people with barely any children around. It took 30-40 years, until the old people began gradually dying or moving to care homes, and young families began moving in again, before they turned into places with a regular mix of people of all ages.",,/r/europe/comments/ntfjn5/belgrades_first_skyscraper/h0snsyq/,7elevenses,1622988324

5984,"You have it backwards. Top-down planned areas are worse urban-planning-wise, while the dense, organic urbanism of city centers are much, much better. Noone wants to actually be(spend time) in New Belgrade. It has no street life because it isn't mixed use(and it isn't very walkable besides). So there isn't as much of a sense of community. The car reliance is not as environmentally friendly and the buildings are not as adaptable(and suffer from high density sprawl) as those in the old town. All in all, it is less socially and environmentally efficient than Old Belgrade. Organic, collective urbanism is FAR superior in terms of efficiency to anything that is planned from the top-down by even the most experienced planners. You cannot plan for an ecosystem, you have to let it grow by itself. Urban planning goes too far as a profession. 

People often make the mistake of assuming that planned cities with strict geometric designs are better planned than the natural, informal, organic urbanism when they are in-fact overplanned.
