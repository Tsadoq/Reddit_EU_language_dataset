Also Putin won't agree to any interference from outside Russian Federation. Unfortunately we can't demand, even US and EU together, we can't demand to put our observers there, because we have no way to enforce this. We would have to threaten sanctions or war.

As we know sanctions to the oligarchy is no important as they will just steal that money from their less fortunate countryman, and nobody will threaten war with Russia, mainly because we don't know how effective their nuclear arsenal is and how would China react.

Unfortunately whatever we do in legal way will have none to minimal effect. I hope that opposition in Belarus takes over power by force as it's their only option right now and then asks NATO, US and EU for help. This would still probably result in high tensions between west and Russia, but if we react within NATO quick enough, Russia wouldn't risk it attacking us. They wouldn't give up and storm in as fast as they can, but in my opinion Polish and Lithuanian army should be moved close to Belarus border to show we are ready to stand the ground if need be, giving us advantage.

Most likely it happens because the comment was quite obvious at the time you added the flair, but users like me who come a couple of hours later don't get to see that comment because it has been burried by lots of more upvoted comments.

(This should also be a community responsibility: people should upvote this kind of comments to the top. That's exactly what upvotes are for: increase the visibility of comments that stimulate healthy discussion. But they use it as a disagree button instead, so we need the mods to stick it.)

If what you say is right, the current scenario makes all sense for Putin. The population of Belarus revolts against Lukashenko (same as in Ukraine vs Yanukovich), Lukashenko eventually resigns (same as in Ukraine), Putin gets rid of Lukashenko and uses temporary instability in Belarus as a reason to ""peacefully invade"".

He can copy-paste the same reasons he used in Ukraine, like ""it was an unconstitutional revolt, because Lukashenko won elections, so I had to use force, to stabilize the situation""

Russia doesn't get as much as in Crimea? I want to remind u, there is still conflict in the east of Ukraine, where the Ukrainian army fights against so-called Novorosya, which is basically a Russian puppet state.

And it seems like there is not much sense for Russia to continue this conflict since they got what they wanted and its not like Ukraine will invade Russia as a retaliation, but the conflict continues.

But more seriously, even if Putin wanted Lukashenko gone, it's not for the same reasons the West would like to see him leave. So it kinda depends on what you mean by ""same side"".

The West supports the protests, because the West - supposedly - supports democratic values and fair elections. Putin doesn't give a flying fuck about that. Quite the contrary. He has his own reasons.

&gt;While ties between the two countries run deep, the rift has been widening for years over oil prices, trade disputes, political integration between Russia and Belarus, as well as Russian military presence in the smaller nation.

402,"Maybe you would disagree with this, but I'd be curious about what you think so hear goes. Basically I believe Russia's transition to a market economy was a corrupt clusterfuck because the transition itself was centrally planned, which is extremely ironic.

The problem is you had too many western imperialists and not enough market economists advising Russia during their transition to a market economy. China's transition was successful because rather than ""privatizing"" by selling off state assets rewarding all the oligarchs in positions of political power, they simply allowed local bureaucrats to experiment with different systems and were told the CCP would look the other way if things were going well. Margaret Thatcher made the exact same mistake when selling off the UK's railroads, you should never have the state selling off state assets, because in theory the state isn't the rightful owner of them in the first place they really belong to the people. It is better to split up and transfer control of state assets to local governments, because local governments are more efficient and less corruptible (on average) for a variety of reasons. So in China officially there was no transition to a market economy, but to ""communism with Chinese characteristics"".

China's transition was more organic and based on political competition where the local governments themselves essentially became quasi-private entities operating on incentives similar to a profit/loss system, and different areas were competing with different systems.",Diet America™,/r/europe/comments/i6je10/hundreds_waiting_outside_embassy_of_belarus/g0yfxlv/,LateralusYellow,1597027596

We are supper happy to have Maidan. We had democratic elections and got pro Ukrainian government. The issue was, they could not do much as lot of power was still in hands of corrupted people in the system. It was really difficult to fix everything in short term and they focused on one basic topic - country's sovereignty and independence by restoring destroyed army and cutting Russian propaganda through media and Russian church.  
Other very needed reforms were not moving well or fast enough and people get super naive to trust populist oligarch puppet - Zelenskiy.

&gt;Why are you so obsessed with it? 

Im not,you are.
Im just saying it's hilarious you accuse others of pushing alternative history when you push a theory as an accepted fact.

&gt; Albanians have been living here as far back as history goes, speaking a pre-roman language, carrying traditions from back then up until today. 

Top channel Albania would be proud. 

&gt;We didn't bend over at all

Then why did the majority convert?

&gt; you serbs funded the whole ottoman government for centuries. 

Source?

&gt;We fought and revolted more times than you can count. 

Yet you became a state first time in 1912, when Serbia occupied half of Albania and Austria Hungary and Italy gave you independence, you didn't even fight for it with the Ottomans. Think about it, the only reason you have a state is that Serbia and Montenegro occupied half of Albania from the Ottomans. 

&gt; Ottomans gave us a way better deal because we were worth more than you buddy, thats why.

As in, more likely to convert?  Then yes.

&gt;We are lightyears ahead when it comes to intellect lmao. 

Um....how do you quantify that? 

&gt;Unlike you people who got yourselves stuck between a rock and a hard place.

You haven't checked your own situation have you?

&gt;You constantly feel the need to compare yourself to other people and to project some fake alt history propaganda because your dictator wants you to.

Nothing i said is propaganda, all verifiable info. 

You're the one pushing some alternative theories and trying to quantify intellect instead of providing any meaningful meter where you are ahead.

&gt;You're 100 levels behind when it comes to this topic buddy, why do you talk about things you know nothing about?

im sure albanianhistory.net is an unbiased source. 

&gt;I don't give a fuck about you or what you think you have. 

You literally went all salty in a thread about Serbia, about a fortress we controlled a 1000 years before you were a state. But somehow i think the selfawareness eludes you again.

We can skip all of the WW2 where the US stood Germany back up, the US keeping Berlin from falling to the Soviets in the Berlin airlift, the Marshall plan, ect. 

But even today the US keeps Germany under its nuclear umbrella meaning if someone nukes Germany the US nukes them and likely also gets nuked. The US is by far the largest protector in NATO. The US ensures free trade which Germany depends on. 

Ultimately, you’re trying to have it both ways. You call for transatlantic links and better relations, without addressing the fact that a number of your policy choices are undercutting transatlantic solidarity. 

Germany demands to go its own way on energy policy, defense spending, and relations with China, without the audacity, vision, or resources that France invests in its conception of strategic autonomy. 

*As a result, Germany finds itself in the unenviable spot of depending on the United States for its defense, Russia for a mounting share of its natural-gas imports, and China for a growing share of its industrial exports.*

They could have cooked the vote counts in the central election committee, but the opposition's poll workers reported the vote counts from their precinct to the opposition campaign HQ on the phone, which I guess happened faster than the official communication to the election committee because they were young enthusiastic guys eager for change, not a decades-old bureaucracy.

Turkey has not much to offer compared to Greece. For a country that has 8x more people than Greece, they lack in having an actual dominance over Greece.

They don't even have a much bigger navy with only a few more ships, Greece on the other hand posses SCALPs that can take out any ship.

Not to mention the most important thing: Turkey has its army deployed in Syria and Libya right now. They won't even be able to face Greece with full force. Greece on the other hand has ALL its military deployed in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean.

1031,"FORT BREGANCON (Reuters) - World powers must put aside their differences and support the Lebanese people, whose country’s future is at stake after a massive blast devastated the capital, French President Emmanuel Macron told an emergency donors conference on Sunday.

Lebanon’s debt-laden economy was already mired in crisis and reeling from the coronavirus pandemic before the port explosion, which killed 158 people.

But foreign governments are wary about writing blank cheques to a government perceived by its own people to be deeply corrupt and some are concerned about the influence of Iran through the shi’ite group Hezbollah.

In opening remarks to an online donor conference he co-organised, Macron said the international response should be coordinated by the United Nations in Lebanon.

“Despite differences in view, everyone must come to the help of Lebanon and its people,” Macron said via video-link from his summer retreat on the French Riviera. “Our task today is to act swiftly and efficiently.”

The president said the offer of assistance included support for an impartial, credible and independent inquiry into the Aug. 4 blast, which has prompted some Lebanese to call for a revolt to topple their political leaders.

The explosion gutted entire neighbourhoods, leaving 250,000 people homeless, razing businesses and destroying critical grain supplies.

Rebuilding Beirut will likely run into the billions of dollars. Economists forecast the blast could wipe up to 25% off of the country’s GDP.

Many Lebanese are angry at the government’s response and say the disaster highlighted the negligence of a corrupt political elite. Protesters stormed government ministries in Beirut and trashed the offices of the Association of Lebanese Banks on Saturday.

TRUMP: “EVERYONE WANTS TO HELP”
Macron visited Beirut on Thursday, the first world leader to do so after the explosion, and promised humanitarian aid would come but that profound political reform was needed to resolve the country’s problems and secure longer term support.

“I guarantee you, this (reconstruction) aid will not go to corrupt hands,” Macron told the throngs who greeted him.

There has been an outpouring of sympathy for Lebanon from around the world this week and many countries have sent immediate humanitarian support such as a medical supplies, but there has been an absence of financial aid commitments so far.

Macron said the international community had a duty to help. Aid should be funnelled as quickly as possible to public and private bodies, as well as NGOs, he said.

“Our role is to be by their sides,” he said. “Lebanon’s future is at stake.”

A Macron aide declined on Saturday to set a target for the conference. Emergency aid was needed for reconstruction, food aid, medical equipment and schools and hospitals, the official said.

Israel had signalled its willingness to help, Macron said, but together with Iran was not represented on the video conference.

You know nothing. 

Greeks learn in school from a very young age about cultural influences due to the Greek enormously long history. Children are taught how Middle Eastern influences played a role in art or pottery. Then how they learn about Hellenistic multiculturalism. Then how Christianity came along and how Greeks left behind their traditions in order to adopt new ones. Then how foreign revolutions and ideals played a role in the developement of the modern Greek Enlightenment. 

As far as the fustanella goes it is a geographical phenomenon. Similar skirts were worn throughout the Balkans, dating back to Greek antiquity. The Greeks and Albanians developed that style of skirt, the fustanella, mainly in mountainous Epirus due to the cold weather. Thinking that a small community like the Albanian one had a secret clothing design that later on would be stolen by Greeks who saw that and thought ""these Albanians are up to something. We should steal it"" is absurd. The fustanella was a trait of people living in a certain area. Not an ethnic one.

1307,"**Ok, good, so let's to sum up. Polish situation:**

- Emigration is falling, mostly since 2015 (end of Tusk government effects) [Stats](https://www.statista.com/statistics/957135/poland-emigration/)

- Immigration is rising [Stats](https://www.statista.com/statistics/957100/poland-immigration/)

- Happiness index in Poland is drasticly rising [Stat1](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Poland/happiness/) [Stat2](https://www.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news%2C387823%2Ccbos-zadowolenie-polakow-z-zycia-wzroslo-przez-ostatni-rok.html)  + bonus [I didn't even know we are happier than Germans, that's hilarious](https://europa.eu/!GN97Qj)

- 85% of Poles feel safe &amp; sound in here. We are also doing good in international statistics. [Stat1](https://www.gazetaprawna.pl/artykuly/1487840,cbos-85-proc-polakow-uwaza-ze-w-polsce-zyje-sie-bezpiecznie.html)  [Stat2](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/non-economic-data/worlds-safest-countries-2019)


The above shows that we are going in the right direction, people feel good and safe here, they are happy, even foreigners appreciate this place very much. Of course, there are groups that are unhappy, as in any country. But in time, everything will work out. We learn at our own speed.


**On the contrary &amp; your arguments:**

- The main accusations come from Germany and France - the countries that created Nazism, colonialism, and caused the first holocaust in history - the French revolution. You see that? The greatest murderers and war criminals in history teach Poland, a country that build it's power in XV century on tolerance, and then nobody like it.
  
- Your arguments:
-- Anecdotal argument - because you manipulate all the time, you know that anecdotal arguments have basically no cognitive value [Your link](https://apnews.com/d3e019166ccc897df01a7537e4872576). Even if we assume they are true (and names and surnames used in the article are very popular in Poland), they are still anecdotal. 

-- You provide links unrelated to the subject and behind the paywalk [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/world/europe/poland-domestic-violence-treaty.html)

-- And your nother links unrelated to the topic [Link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-poland/eu-executive-sues-poland-in-top-eu-court-for-undermining-independence-of-courts-idUSKCN1M412Q)


**In conclusion**, your arguments are anecdotal and loosly related to subject. I won't go down to your level of manipulation - it is well known for few years that by attacking us, Western Europe is trying to cover up its own problems (mainly huge racism) and take leverage on us. That's just how politics work. And real arguments only make you more and more ridiculous so that you admit that you take pleasure in not respecting others (you're from Germany, right?)


Everyone who has been to Poland knows well all the above. I will give here an anecdotal proof, but unlike your article, in which there is no real data, **in my example, a real person signs his name under what he writes**. [Iranian Imam loved Poland - maybe even too much](https://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2020-08-04/iranski-imam-zachwycony-polska-jedyny-taki-kraj-na-swiecie/).

1375,"&gt;Research on the subject shows that the gender of the parents does not affect the kids - having a stable, loving home does.

Lgbtq organisations are extremly powerful and are surely able to fund many studies that will be pushed in their favour. There are researches that are pro and against same sex adoptions as this is a topic that has long been in focus. There are also many people who were raised in the same sex families and don't agree that gay couples should be able to adopt. Will it change your opinion? - ofcourse not. 

&gt;""LGBTQ ideology being pushed down [your] throat"" = queer people having any presence in the public space at all. Somehow it's ok for straights to kiss in public, or talk about their spouse, or have a public wedding, but when a gay couple does it suddenly it's forcing their sexuality on everyone else.

I don't care if you kiss in public. I don't want you to adopt and I don't want to finance your activities and organisations by paying taxes. Get a job and stop sucking my money. 


&gt;Children aren't born hateful - they are taught to hate.

Yes, we see that everyday with Lgbtq activists. The hate they project towards those who don't think the same is like no other. You don't own monopoly on deciding what is hate and what is love, sorry to break it to you.


&gt;I am yet to hear how is the recognition of same sex relationships or allowing trans people to transition with some dignity is supposed to ""destroy the family"".

Saint John Paul II wrote a lot on these topics. If you really want to learn more I suggest visiting your local library and reading some of his texts/books. [Here is a good start](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/revitalizing-society-through-the-family-vision-of-john-paul-ii-10443).

Also, as marriage is a religious institution, I fail to see how it affects gay people that they can't marry? If marriage means nothing to you, why should you be allowed to marry?


&gt;Go fuck yourself with ""support for Poles"". Religious fundamentalists and nationalist fanatics do not have a monopoly on Poland or on patriotism, no matter how much they wail and froth otherwise.

1500,"So, let me give you my layman's take.

Your goal with measurements at all is to come up with a number that approximates something in the real world.

The point of PPP is to take into account domestic context.  Most people buy domestic things disproportionately.  How expensive it is domestically affects what you can get.

With a wage, PPP-adjusting it measures what actual stuff a person can get with the wage in a location.

With a per-capita GDP, PPP-adjusting it measures what actual stuff the economic activity generated by one average person is equal to.

There, PPP takes account of the context of the surrounding country.  And using a single value is meaningful, because even if some hypothetical person spent their entire wage on something, changing what one person is doing doesn't affect the PPP index much.

Maybe if there was some ludicrously-wealthy mogul who had 90% of the wealth in a country, PPP-adjusting what he could buy wouldn't make much sense, because if he actually used his assets for anything, it'd alter the country and the PPP index for his first unit of currency spent would be different for those later — he'd basically have to be buying from the international market, not domestic, for most of that.

With a whole country…if you scoop up all the economic activity in the country, you can't go spend it anywhere than abroad.  I mean, the point of PPP is to take into account the surrounding context in which one can buy.  But that doesn't exist here at all.  The surrounding purchasing context is international and nominal terms already tells you what real stuff the country can get on the international market.

It's just that the PPP-adjusted number you produce doesn't really correspond to anything in the real world.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/i62ry4/its_interesting_to_see_how_the_eu_is_considered/g0v2nwc/,duisThias,1596948429

I think even Martin Luther King would be ashamed of what some black people do to fight racism and he would be pretty upset at the other folks for helping in that. They play antifas games, which is like a nazi movement for the left wing. Not accepting people who don’t think like they do. They don’t even fight fascism anymore, they fight people who don’t think like they do. That’s what you’re doing now.

Actually not true and I can expand more. Usually the cost of college is by stupid people not knowing what it means to have 2.5 GPA and trying to do a engineering course.

This is also more of a propaganda in Reddit and most is not real- BUT Some of it actually is real and the fact that in a country like America even 1% of those sob stories can be real is an embarrassment and I always support Euros in making fun of the US healthcare system. So we are allies here on this regard.

1787,"&gt; Please check trump’s latest directive that makes all covid data go to White House.

The directive has hospital reporting that was going to CDC go to the Health and Human Services Dept. It does not affect the reporting those hospitals were already doing to their respective states.  

[COVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQs For Hospitals, Hospital Laboratory, and Acute Care Facility Data Reporting ](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf)

&gt; Who is responsible for reporting?

&gt; By default, hospitals should report the detailed information listed below on a daily basis through one of the prescribed methods. However, we recognize that many states currently collect this information from the hospitals. Therefore, hospitals may be relieved from reporting directly to the Federal Government if they receive a written release from the State stating that the State will collect the data from the hospitals and take over Federal reporting responsibilities. 

The idea that Trump is going to hide coronavirus data by forcing hospitals to only report to the WH is a stupid conspiracy theory. 

&gt; These are confirmed border guards under homeland control designed to fight organized crime on the border (gangs)

And? They're not military and therefore aren't ""troops"".

&gt; Where were these troops when that federal building was occupied by armed men in Wyoming or Dakota?

Are you talking about the occupation by some sovereign citizens of a [National Wildlife Refuge building in Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge)?  Because that definitely involved federal law enforcement such as the FBI and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), in addition to the local and state police. 

In any event, the number of people involved in that occupation was much smaller than the crowds of 100+ that show up every night to cause mayhem in Portland.  

&gt; Please stop. The governor and the mayor states they don’t want the troops but trump not only overrode it he threatened (and is in process) to send more troops to other cities (oddly enough only democratic run cities)

It is not up to a mayor or governor whether federal property is allowed to be defended from attack.  [That argument has been settled already](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter). 

And if Democrat politicians don't like additional federal law enforcement protecting federal property in their city, then they should stop preventing their police forces from maintaining order.  Even recently in Portland, where their governor has agreed to have the Oregon state police assist with protecting federal property, there are *still* nightly riots in Portland.  Last night [24 people were arrested](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/news/read.cfm?id=261079&amp;ec=3&amp;ch=twitter) after they threw rocks, chunks of concrete and fireworks and shined lasers at police as well as laid down nails for cars to run over.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/i66etk/belarus_today/g0ukugl/,Shmorrior,1596937158

1908,"&gt;Can't agree here. Poland is part of EU and NATO, like most of our western European countries, in contrast to Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, which are not. Poland has switched sides since the cold war, a fact I'm sure you have noticed.

So have the Baltics, Romania and Croatia, but they're not ""Central Europe"". 

Culturally, politically, diplomatically and militarily Poland is more similar to Romania, Ukraine and not just even, but especially, Russia than it is to the Germany, Switzerland, or the Netherlands. You can join Mercorus, but it won't magically turn Poland South American. You can join TPP but you won't border Australia. 

It actually strikes me that a large section of Poland have actually taken that joining such organization like NATO or the EU is all they need to join the Western cultural sphere, and then they can act however they like and hide behind officialities and empty naming conventions instead of actually modernizing their society. 

Which is sad, in so many ways.

&gt; Calling countries by geographical, cardinal directions is not a geographical discussion?

Europe is a geopolitical construct. The areas of Europe are geopolitical constructs.

Then there is the fact that they seem to be more tight at the company level, you know, superiors looking the other way. It’s more common with special forces I think and, again, the US has more special forces abroad and so on.

So what is winning and what is the price of achieving that end? 

As I see it the most important issue to resolve is Ukraine's autonomy over its destiny and as cruel as that my sound, it means they could win on that front without regaining full control of the eastern regions. I think that limited outcome could be achieved by wearing the Russians out, building strong ties to the EU, and the Americans, without formally joining NATO or the EU, and then agreeing to a face saving deal whereby the Donetsk region gets a kind of special status, perhaps even a referendum about joining Russia. That kind of deal might cost a whole lot less blood and treasure than it would to overcome the Russian military.","Well, I think it's funny",/r/europe/comments/i6384n/will_turkey_ever_join_the_eu/g0tcos9/,half-responsibly,1596913372

Erdogan:   Hated for obvious reasons, no need for context.

Trump:   Hated for same reasons other European countries hate him.

Boris:   Hated due to Brexit drama, a big amount of Greeks live or study in the UK so he kinda left them in limbo. He is also seen as a huge clown. 

Merkel:   She is relatively Hated by most Greeks simply because she was the face of German and EU politics during the crisis (for obvious reasons), wait till you hear what Greeks have to say about Schäuble. 

Putin:   He is Disliked for the totalitarian dictator that he is but he is liked by a lot of conservatives because, of religious and historical ties between Greece and Russia. He is also seen as ""the defender of the faith"" by some, I personally don't see it (even though relatively religious).

Macron:   He is loved thanks to the big support he has given Greece during the recent East Mediterranean crisis we are going through.

Mitsotakis:   Being the prime minister he is bound to be a divisive figure. But he is liked by the bigger part of our population mostly because he is the opposite of the circus that was the SYRIZA government. Though he is heavily criticised on social media by left and right wing alike. (Not TV media though, those ones like him).

Anastasiadis:   He is liked cause he is the Cypriot president (Greek brothers and whatnot) and we are in this East Mediterranean situation together.

Half a century of NPT haven't brought us disarmament they've brought us a tiered system of nations, with some allowed nukes and other not for reasons that have nothing to do with fairness or even with the security of the species. So to achieve disarmament in the long run, radical proliferation should be given a shot. Spike the risk now so future generations won't have to deal with it.

In the short term this will serve our security interests too. Should the Russian little green men go on vacation to Estonia, and should the Estonian deterrent be clearly functional, normal Russians won't greet this military adventure with smug nostalgia, but by fleeing every urban centers and military sites that may soon be nothing more than a pile of ashes. Whatever lunatic the Americans elect, they will have to send him to Estonia to peacefully get the country de-occuppied. European industrialists looking out for number one, will also quickly see that the only way to ever make profit again will be to avoid annihilation.

2303,"No, Germany declared war on France, Russia, Belgium, Luxemburg, Portugal and was at the initiative of the US and British declaration of war upon her (Failure to respect belgian neutrality and the sinking of the lusitania).

To make things very clear because this is a very common mistake people make.

All of the following events are written in historical order

* july 28: Austria Hungary declares war on Serbia

## PART 1: Germany at war

* august 1: Germany declares war on Russia and mobilizes after their ultimatum for no mobilisation is not met.
* august 3: Germany declares war on France after their ultimatum for all fortresses up to Verdun to be occupied by germany is not met.
* august 4: Germany declares war upon Belgium and in the same day the UK declares war on Germany for failing to respect belgian neutrality.
* august 6: Serbia declares war on Germany

## Part 2: Austria Hungary at War
* august 6: Austria hungary declares war on Russia
* august 11: France declares war on Austria Hungary
* august 12: The UK declares war on Austria Hungary
* august 28: Austria Hungary declares war on Belgium.


Key points:

* Germany, russia, France, Belgium and the UK were at war before Germany was at war with Serbia. Germany never declared war on Serbia despite the justification it had later on of ""just being there to back it's ally"". German troops were not ready to go to serbia.
* They were also at war before being at war with Austria Hungary
* Before the entente proper was at war with Austria Hungary, half a million men had died fighting germany.
* The war did not stop in 1916 with the occupation of Serbia or in 1917 with the defeat of Russia. More specifically, in 1917, Germany only sent a peace offer to Britain despite occupying half of northern France.

As you can see and despite the defense of german revisionists, Austria may have started a war with Serbia, but that war was not meant to be WW1. Germany started WW1 and that's why it was made to bear responsibility in Versailles. The attitude of germany was not that of a secondary participant, but that of a belligerent country.",PM_ME_FOR_RAFALES,/r/europe/comments/i5tr94/german_soldiers_helping_wounded_romanian_soldiers/g0s93xu/,Floyddit,1596890835

2310,"Yes, my original comment was that the EU has more leverage than the UK. Although a no deal situation will hurt them, they can still afford it politically. Of course, they'll still absolutely prefer a deal, but they certainly *can't* afford one where they give the Brits preferential treatment compared to their own members and other trade partners.

That is what the comment, I replied, to was claiming. That the EU would somehow go all appeasement here. It makes no sense for them to do so.

But again, this is (of course) speaking about the big picture. It should be obvious to everyone that no party is going to stick to their starting position permanently.

2455,"Hi, I think you are certainly correct on the fact that national identity is a fuzzy and evolving thing, that takes shape based on historical events.

But I read enough treaties from Venetian ambassadors (from 1500), the correspondence of Venetian families(from 1500 to 1700) and treaties and books from Venetian intellectuals. To assure you that they did define themselves as italians and they assumed most in the penisola did too (I don't know what the rest of the penisola thought, but I am inclined to think they agreed). However these were the elites of Venice, I am not sure what the average person would have though, however The Casanova memoirs seam to suggest us that the urban population of Italy in 1700 defined themselves as Italians.

Against the idea of Italy not existing linguistically I have to fight back, because I think this idea of a nation needing one language and not being able to enjoy its linguistic diversity is wrong and should be fought back. Most Venetian in 1500 spoke their language but considered Italian part of their culture too. For example Nicolò Tiepolo after having been in Spain and presenting a reletion to the Venetian senate says Spanish is a Latin language ""come anca la nostra Italiana"" (like our Italian one). As it was costume, he presented this relation in Venetian and transcribe it in Italian, so I don't think regional language should be considered an obstacle to national identity.

Finally you seam to believe the idea that the presence of ""nationalism"" (originally definable with the idea that each nation needs its state) is necessary to indicate the existence of Italy. Maybe this is a valid view, but I don't take it, because is quite clear that what Nicolò Tiepolo means with Italian (in 1553) and what I mean now are similar enough to indicate a share common identity.","Veneto, Italy",/r/europe/comments/i5a0je/on_august_7_1420_the_construction_of_the_dome_of/g0s1rs0/,Giallo555,1596884208

Being sexually attracted to children without acting on it already isn't a crime. The one area where I could see pedophile rights being expanded would be in victimless pornography - fiction and roleplay - though I'm not sure how to ethically test whether slackening these rules would or wouldn't decrease the rate of child rape.

Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. 

Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. 

Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/i5ujhg/copenhagen_denmark/g0rnl7v/,nastratin,1596869875

It was actually the king of danish(Iceland was a colony) which caused the end of executions since you had to have a special dispensation for it and the king generally lessened the verdict to life in jail

2888,"This summer, Europe is basking in a sense of accomplishment. On July 21, after protracted labor, the European Union announced the birth of a historic recovery package to the tune of 750 billion euros ($880 billion). It’s not only that this is a lot of money. For the first time, a considerable sum will be financed through large-scale borrowing by the EU itself. Once again Europe has managed to turn a crisis into the spur for major institutional change.

With the troubled last decade of the eurozone in mind, it is tempting to view these changes as long-overdue updates of Europe’s incomplete union. That is both true and reassuring in confirming that, once again, Europe “got there” in the end. But by the same token, this complacent narrative tends to diminish the scale of Europe’s problems and the novelty of the crisis we face in 2020. The speed and scale of changes forced on Europe since this spring ought to give one pause for thought. To move Europe this far this fast takes an almighty shock. Even with this latest package, it is far from obvious that Europe is sufficiently equipped to meet the challenges ahead.

To appreciate the sense of relief in Europe this summer, it is worth recalling how unlikely this outcome seemed only a few months ago—and how serious a disaster COVID-19 has been for the continent. In terms of national excess mortality, only Ecuador and Peru exceed the levels of mortality recorded in Spain, Italy, and Belgium. We talk a lot about America’s mishandling of the crisis. But in terms of mortality, only New York and New Jersey are in the same league as Europe’s hot spots. As of July, recalcitrant red states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia aren’t even close.

The lockdowns that stopped the virus in Europe have had a devastating economic impact. Again, the American habit of dramatizing data by means of annualizing rates of change disguises the fact that economic implosion in Europe has been every bit as bad, if not worse. The U.S. economy fell 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020. Germany’s contracted by 10 percent. In Spain, the collapse was twice as bad, at 18.5 percent. (If Spain reported its data in the American style, it would be down 65 percent on the year.)",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/i5sbe2/its_a_new_europeif_you_can_keep_it/g0r8217/,Joko11,1596858059

2892,"On top of the virus and the economic catastrophe, in May it looked as though everything was going wrong in political terms as well. As the crisis hit hard in late February, the Europeans, with France and Germany in the lead, resorted to national measures, shutting off the export of personal protective equipment and closing down borders. Italy’s appeals for aid were met with stony silence, and Brussels lacked the powers to push through a more cooperative approach. On March 12, Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), announced that Italy’s spreads were not the business of the European bank, sending interest rates on Italian debt to new highs. A proposal from a coalition of heavyweight governments led by France for joint borrowing in the form of “coronabonds” was unceremoniously shot down by Berlin. Then a ruling by the German Constitutional Court put in question the legal basis for the ECB’s bond market purchases. Perhaps unsurprisingly, public opinion, especially in hard-hit Spain and Italy, was swinging against Europe.

It was a disillusioning shock. Since the start of the year, Ursula von der Leyen’s new European Commission had been doing its best to encourage deeper integration with the mood music of a Green New Deal. Now COVID-19 was reopening old wounds, reminding Europeans that since the end of the eurozone crisis in 2012, they had made frustratingly little progress on the key issues of structural reform, notably on the banking union and the capacity for a more proactive fiscal policy. By early April, the sense of crisis was acute. Not for nothing, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke of Europe facing a “moment of truth.”

This being Europe, that “moment” turned into a protracted three-month battle. But the results, in terms of responding to the pandemic in public health, political, and economic terms, are impressive, certainly by contrast with anywhere in the world outside of East Asia.

With regard to the virus, the Europeans have managed to do what the United States has failed to do. They have not just damped down the hot spots, as New York has done. The EU has managed to prevent a massive spillover to member states, for instance in Eastern Europe, that were largely spared the first wave. This made possible a cautious return to a “new normality.”",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/i5sbe2/its_a_new_europeif_you_can_keep_it/g0r857t/,Joko11,1596858116
2893,"Furthermore, though their economies have taken a huge hit, European countries have used short-time working schemes to keep unemployment levels far below the extraordinary levels seen in the United States, at least for now. And rather than escalating the political tensions, again by contrast with the United States, they have been turned in a positive direction.
With the connivance of the German government and even the Bundesbank, the challenge to the ECB by Germany’s Constitutional Court was smothered. In May, France and Germany sidestepped the coronabonds impasse and threw their weight behind the proposal that would become the July 21 deal: to raise money directly via the EU’s own budget; fund that budget with debts issued by the EU itself rather than member states; and distribute a large share of the funds to the most distressed countries in the form of grants, rather than loans, so that their already heavy debt burdens do not grow.

It was never going to be an easy deal to sell to the coalition of fiscal conservatives led by the Dutch. The negotiations were extraordinarily protracted and fraught. They were not always dignified. There was media gamesmanship. Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are said to have lost their tempers on more than one occasion. But no one quit the marathon meeting. A deal was done. This, the EU spin tells us, is what adult politics looks like.
In the process, the more conservative voices of Northern Europe extracted serious concessions. Unfortunately, those came at the expense of some of the more progressive and innovative budget elements, including spending on joint efforts in the areas of health care and green investment. Thankfully, the package is up for debate in the European Parliament, which is, step by step, asserting leverage over Europe’s politics. Earlier in the crisis, the Parliament favored a far more expansive plan, and hopefully it will make adjustments to the July compromise.

This is how the standard Europe storyline goes. Europe writes commitments to solidarity and cooperation that it cannot cash. It comes up hard against reality. It responds by “falling forward” and deepening its institutional commitments. This so-called “functionalism” is the homegrown ideology of the EU. It has served Brussels well. And in short order, 2020 will no doubt be inscribed in the long list of crises through which Europe has developed.
As an ideology to live by, the EU’s functionalism is both comforting and oddly disempowering. After all, needing a fix is one thing; developing and agreeing on a solution in a timely fashion is quite another. To assume that the former necessarily leads to the latter is to take a remarkable sanguine view of history that tends to underestimates the degree of risk and the need for agency.",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/i5sbe2/its_a_new_europeif_you_can_keep_it/g0r872s/,Joko11,1596858150

2896,"This summer, there was certainly nothing inevitable about the way the deal was done. It did not seem likely. Credit goes to the European Commission for raising the stakes, upping the original suggestion by Merkel and Macron to an ask of 750 billion euros, on top of the regular 1.1 trillion euro ($1.3 trillion) multiyear budget. (It was the Commission’s officials who dug up the legal precedent that would allow the EU to justify massive borrowing.) Among national governments, one has to admire the Spanish and Italians, who began the long march toward a constructive European response back in March and suffered through the demeaning objections of Northern Europeans without walking away. The best that can be said for the Dutch and the Austrians is that they gave way in the end. Perhaps the shameless defense of the narrowest conception of national interest by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz will serve some useful purpose in dampening criticism from their domestic populists.
But in the last instance, it is clear that what held the negotiations together was the weight of the Franco-German alliance. And the clear-headed and dauntless advocates of that partnership are the French. Since he assumed the French presidency in 2017, in the wake of the disastrous refugee crisis that had rocked Europe in 2015-2016, Macron has been appealing to Berlin for cooperation. For three long years, Merkel denied Macron the strategic alliance that he craved. That hurt. And in the fall of 2019, there were signs of increasing impatience in Paris, with Macron making unilateral moves toward Moscow. What changed in 2020 was that Merkel came around.
What motivated the shift?

It is true, of course, that Merkel has announced her retirement. She does not face reelection. But that was true already last year, when she showed no inclination to lead the way on Europe.
Since the disastrously inconclusive Bundestag election of 2017, Merkel’s so-called grand coalition had been on a fragile footing, with both partners losing public support. It takes an effort to remember now, but in February, as COVID-19 was silently spreading in Europe, the main news in Germany was the crisis in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) unleashed by the coalition negotiations in Thuringia, in which Merkel’s party ended up partnering with the far-right Alternative for Germany. That ended the prospects of Merkel’s designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Later that same month, as the outbreak in Italy had already burst into the open, Berlin’s focus was on the Eastern Mediterranean and the urgent need to patch up the refugee deal with Turkey. The biggest threat to Europe was thought to be an escalation of the crisis in Syria and a return of the migrant crisis. On March 6, the CDU slumped to a record low of 26 percent in the polls. Not since the formation of the Federal Republic had the party system seemed more in flux.
It was not by accident that as the crisis deepened, the French government started its latest approach to Berlin not via the chancellery but by working its connections to the Social Democrats in the German Finance Ministry. In a desperate effort to revive the flagging political fortunes of the Social Democrats and his own chances of party leadership in 2019, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz had become the leading German proponent of European reform, pushing ideas both for unemployment insurance and banking. Both had been met by stony disapproval from the CDU and a nein from the chancellery.

As recently as April, Merkel was not just stonewalling on coronabonds but explicitly rejecting any idea of grants rather than loans from the EU to its members. Then something shifted. What Merkel saw in the polls was not only a remarkable surge in support for her and her party but also a shift in the center ground of German public opinion in favor of greater European solidarity. As the full impact of the lockdowns made itself felt, it became clear that Europe was facing a truly devastating economic shock that would divide the continent—a risk made worse, once again, by Germany’s relative success. Meanwhile, the threats to Germany’s export-orientated economy from a European recession were all too real.
COVID-19 is the right kind of crisis for Merkel. As is well known, Merkel is not a conviction politician when it comes to Europe, in the sense that her great Christian Democratic predecessors—Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl—were. But that is in part because Merkel is more forward- than backward-looking. Her reference points are not World War II and the Cold War but the longer and broader history of globalization. It is to meet this challenge that the Europeans need each other. It was entirely typical that in the climactic press conference of May 18, in which Macron and Merkel committed themselves to their joint approach, Merkel made the point that COVID-19 was the kind of crisis that demonstrated the obsolescence of the nation-state. “Europe must act together,” she said. “The nation-state alone has no future.”",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/i5sbe2/its_a_new_europeif_you_can_keep_it/g0r88rq/,Joko11,1596858179
2897,"At the time, this was greeted with puzzlement. Had not Germany’s own comparative success in dealing with COVID-19 demonstrated the importance of competent national government? Did the comparison with the United States not drive that point home?
But Merkel’s standard is not basic competence. She is thinking about the bigger, more strategic question of the German economy and how such public health crises can be managed in the future, through joint surveillance, countermeasures, and vaccine development. She is holding fast to the basic common sense of the era of globalization not as an act of faith or idealistic commitment but as a realism. COVID-19 is one of a range of challenges that demand a complex, multilateral response. On that stage, European cooperation is clearly more urgent than ever. And that is what the differential impact of the crisis in Europe put in question.
It was when the problem was framed in those terms, precisely not as a rerun of the eurozone crisis but as a new challenge requiring new solutions, that Merkel grasped the nettle.
Defining the problem in these terms freed the conversation. But it also defined the limits of the new deal. The COVID-19 fix does not resolve the legacy issues of the era of the eurozone crisis. It does not even mention them.

The discussions in July centered entirely on new money to be raised by the EU. The old debts that burden the public accounts of Italy, Spain, and France were not part of the conversation. Nor were the giant new debts that they are loading onto their national balance sheets this year and next to meet the COVID-19 crisis. For now, the fiscal rules of the eurozone are in abeyance. But what was agreed in the laborious discussions of the European Council was a new control mechanism, a process through which the European nations review and criticize each other’s use of the common funds. As skeptics have observed, this pushes conflict off into the future. In academic discourse about the EU, the old mantras of functionalism are now shadowed by what is called postfunctionalism—or might better be termed dysfunctionalism. The fear is that the grand bargain of July may turn out to have created an arena for bitter nationalist posturing in which the Dutch criticize the Italians and Spaniards and the Southern Europeans respond by naming and shaming Dutch tax havens.

And there is every reason to think conflict will, indeed, arise in the future. Europe has undeniably enjoyed a few good months. But it is far from being out of the woods. Controlling the virus remains a huge challenge. It is far from obvious that it will be possible to get through the rest of the summer and into the fall flu season without further draconian measures.
Meanwhile, the economic damage is huge. Paying for workers to be put on short-time is no doubt the best response to the kind of shock that Europe has suffered. But it is far from obvious that it can be sustained. Particularly in Spain, the epicenter of the eurozone unemployment crisis, the rate of joblessness is rising ominously. Because of the limited scope of the July deal that could be agreed with the fiscal conservatives and the inevitable delay in disbursing the funds, the immediate fiscal response will continue to weigh on the budgets of all European nation-states.
This means that the future of Europe continues to hinge on three questions. First, can Europe achieve not just a recovery from the COVID-19 shock but a return to the kind of growth that it experienced before 2008? In particular, can something be done to raise Italy’s growth rate, or at least to offer its young people a future, perhaps in the form of assistance for education and employment outside Italy, especially now that the U.K. labor market is less hospitable? This will require support for education and training and additional investment in housing to accommodate further growth in the hot spots of the pan-European economy. Before the COVID-19 crisis hit, escalating rents in Germany’s boomtowns were one of the country’s hottest political issues.

Second, will the conservative forces that have been held at bay in 2020 return dogmatically to imposing a hard and fast fiscal corset across Europe? Keen-eyed observers of the Greek situation, like ex-Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, have pointed out that even in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis, the Eurogroup was envisioning Greece returning to a primary budget surplus by 2021. If this were to be implemented in Greece, let alone across the eurozone more generally, it would require a disastrous scale of austerity. For Brussels to offset a fiscal crunch on that scale would require spending far beyond the sums agreed in July. The question is whether, as Merkel leaves the stage, there will be a resurgence of the right-wing in the CDU that would add Germany’s weight to the lightweight coalition of fiscal conservatives currently headed by the Netherlands and Austria.",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/i5sbe2/its_a_new_europeif_you_can_keep_it/g0r8as9/,Joko11,1596858216
2898,"Finally, there is the ECB. Given the debt levels that will be accumulated by Italy in the course of the next 12 months, Europe’s central bank remains pivotal. Since March, the reason that Europe’s bond markets have been calm is the ECB. Without its bond purchases, the unsteady progress of the talks would have unleashed chaos, as it did during the eurozone crisis after 2010. Lagarde, unlike her predecessor Jean-Claude Trichet, took that off the table. That was a political decision. In light of the surging deficits, the ECB will have a crucial role in warehousing public debt and keeping interest rates low. Here, too, politics matters. Even at the height of the crisis in March, there was opposition on the ECB Governing Council to Lagarde’s supportive policy. If that criticism were to become strong enough to put the ECB’s commitment in question, both markets and the European public would have reason to fear an escalation of financial tension.

Growth, fiscal policy, the ECB—this trio of issues was at the heart of European politics when the year began. The difference is that, in the meantime, the Anthropocene has revealed its fangs; more than 130,000 people in Europe have died, many of them unnecessarily; and the continent’s fiscal and economic situation is far worse.
It was this stark reality that drove Europe’s recovery package across the finish line. That should not be said lightly. Acting constructively in the face of both deeply uncomfortable facts and profound internal divisions is a very considerable achievement, one of which the United States has so far proved conspicuously incapable. There is, however, no room for European complacency. As far as COVID-19 is concerned, this may be the end of the beginning. But there is very rough water ahead. To regard the July compromise as anything more than a preliminary answer to the crisis would be a betrayal of the realism that makes the deal so remarkable.",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/i5sbe2/its_a_new_europeif_you_can_keep_it/g0r8c1b/,Joko11,1596858238

And not long ago the Justice Fund, which is a Ministry of Justice thing meant to help violence victims, has decided that this time instead of funding NGOs specialized in aiding those suffering domestic violence etc., they're gonna give 50 million to an organization run by a former exorcist who claims to have defeated a vegetarian demon with some sausage, not to mention having received text messages from Satan himself.

2941,"**A SHORT SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE THING, SINCE IT HASN'T BEEN CLEARLY EXPLAINED** (copied from my other comments)

It's all not about advocating for a free pass for vandalism. A short timeline:

* A ""pro-life"" organization drives around in trucks covered in pictures of dead fetuses and [slogans](https://d-art.ppstatic.pl/kadry/k/r/1/3c/98/5d9457561d019_o_medium.jpg) equating homosexuals with pedophiles (""they're coming for your children"", ""pederasts live 20 years shorter"", ""homosexuals commit pedophilia 20 times more often""), blasting disgusting homophobic propaganda over loudspeakers.

* In 2019 a judge [orders them](https://oko.press/sad-nakazal-fundacji-pro-prawo-do-zycia-usuniecie-homofobicznych-furgonetek-i-plakatow-w-calym-kraju/) to stop using these trucks.

* A few months later they haven't given a single shit and are still driving them, sometimes [escorted by police](https://noizz.pl/spoleczenstwo/zapytalismy-policji-czy-eskortuje-po-warszawie-furgonetke-anty-lgbt/wq0ryfc) (this was after the attack in question and a few cases of drivers blocking the trucks in the street).

* A group of people, including the one this mess is mostly about, attack one of the trucks, slash the homophobic posters along with the tires, steal the plates and shove the driver to the ground.

* Over a month later, which passed with no arrest orders (she was detained but the court [refused](https://oko.press/dzialaczka-stop-bzdurom-wypuszczona-z-aresztu-pod-sklotem-modlitwy-o-nawrocenie-deprawatorow/) the prosecutor's request for a longer arrest and they let her go with a bail and police supervision), she, along with other activists, hangs a few rainbow flags on some monuments in Warsaw.

* The court suddenly changes its mind and decides that despite no flight risk, no chances of intimidating witnesses or other behaviors that would justify this, they're going to accept the prosecution's appeal and arrest her for two months.

* The police arrives at her NGO, but the tension in the crowd is so high that they don't arrest her even when she came at them holding her hands up for cuffs trying to provoke them; then the crowd starts marching towards *the* [Jesus statue](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-lgbt-rights-trfn/polish-activist-faces-jail-for-hanging-rainbow-flag-on-jesus-statue-idUSKCN2522YV) which has [police protection](https://i.redd.it/viqhxeg6umf51.jpg) this time and, in the resulting chaos, plain clothes officers grab her out of the crowd (which is why the car in OP's picture is not a regular police car).

* To top it off, a lot of protesters were also arrested and are being transported and held fuck knows where.

The people here are not angry because she should avoid punishment for vandalism and assault; they're angry because what the court and police are doing is trying to scare activists into staying silent. It's not justice, it's politically motivated abuse.

And just to add salt to the wound, a few days ago a pedophile priest who has already heard a 5-year sentence was [released from arrest](https://www.onet.pl/informacje/onetwroclaw/dolny-slask-sad-wypuszcza-z-aresztu-ksiedza-pedofila-mimo-surowego-wyroku/rc7whgg,79cfc278) to wait for the result of the appeal as a free man since ""all the important evidence has already been presented so he can't tamper with it"".",Poland,/r/europe/comments/i5jx8h/protesting_people_blocked_the_police_car_with_an/g0qruvl/,legrandguignol,1596848648

Idk why you and the other person both try to make this into a argument that has been argued 100124124 times already. My point is not about that.

My point is that, it is not ""fictional"". It is not recognized by basically anyone but it does exist nevertheless. Fictional means something totally different, if it was fictional there could be no drama over it, no arguments about it, nothing. To call it fictional is simply rude from the perspective of history of Cyprus as a whole. Can Cyprus do whatever they want there? No, because there is a very real (aka not fictional) problem there (occupation.). The existence of a rogue state (as you'd call it) is very real.

Technically yes, practically I very much doubt that this ""punish"" thing will ever pop up. If they wanted to punish the UK they would have made it very clear to send a message. But they didn't, they keep negotiating no matter what happens, no matter what Boris says.

If you compare the UK and EU, there is one crucial difference between the two. If UK politician loses face in talks he will likely lose the elections. If the EU makes concessions, nothing happens, nobody losses the elections. Even in France or Germany. And Boris knows this. And EU knows this.

3035,"I read the actual decision. 

UNCLOS is customary law according to the coast 

[This gets 12 nmi territorial waters!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quita_Sueño_Bank)

San Andres is the biggest islands in the chain, its twice the size of Kastellorizo, Providencia is a bit larger than Kastellorizo. The distance between them is 55 nmi. 

The court specifically argues that fairness (which is the alternative to straight up UNCLOS) requires the Colombians islands EEZ not to be fragmented. 

Rho is at 75nmi to Rhodes a bit more but Rhodes is also comparatively massive, 50 times San Andres. It's easy to see the court would consider linking Kastelorrizo's and Rhodes EEZ. 

Now if the court applied the same thinking Turkey would of course not have an EEZ border with Libya but the are of the navtex issued would be outside Greece's EEZ (Cyprus is another story). 

The problem however is that while Turkey is focusing on Kastellorizo the area of the navtex is also within Rhodes, Karpathos and Crete EEZ. Each of those alone is much much bigger than all the Colombian islands. The court could easily afford those islands a better 'weight' than it did the Colombian ones when determining EEZ, after all it's decision was based on coast length ratios. They are different here. 

Cyprus is another issue. The court will likely simply consider equidistance as fair since Cyprus is huge as an island and totally an island nation. Even if it did not it's coastline ratio with Turkey in the contested area is very good. 

The real question is Turkey really considering a fair solution via arbitration? Will it accept the possibility of 12nmi Greek territorial waters in exchange for having even the whole EEZ east of Kastellorizo? 

I think not at this time, it prefers a non-solution and taking it chances to bully it's way into exploiting the contested area without having to risk any judgement that would make it have give up any claims.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/i5f9a4/erdogan_we_start_drilling_again_greeks_unworthy/g0qdzmi/,PPN13,1596841002

3153,"Last public beheading in Denmark in 1882 is mentioned here http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/soelvbjerghoej/stories/denmark-s-last-public-execution 

The truth though is much more gruesome than these few lines of text indicate.

Executions were public events back then and the executioner simply botched the job so thoroughly. Executions were rare. Normally the convicted would get their sentence reduced to life in prison by the Monarchs degree. Keeping the death sentence was considered a deterrent, but was rarely carried through. So the executioner Theodor Seistrup did not have a lot of experience. He bought the ax from the widow of the previous executioner, but he was not a crafted lumberjack that would have enough practice swinging a big ax to ensure a quick death. 

He had been hired a few years before on a resume of 6 lines listing his previous jobs as a police officer and a butcher. Since no one had been executed in over 20 years he probably imagined an extra paycheck for zero work. 

What went wrong is not clear. Some claim he slipped. That the ax was not sharp or more likely there is a big difference between chopping of the head of a chicken than a human. 

So the first blow does not hit the neck, but instead hits his shoulder. Second hit does not work either, and it takes three swings before Anders Sjællænder is dead. 

Prominent people in Denmark was already protesting the public executions as part of the law, so this shoddy kill was the last straw. The same night protest meetings demanding a stop to public executions took place, and the next day newspapers in Copenhagen had front page stories telling the agonizing death of Anders Sjællænder advocating the law to be changed.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/i5hh4a/the_year_of_the_last_execution_for_civilian/g0pzlz8/,Econ_Orc,1596833798

3159,"&gt; Napoleon created the Kingdom of Holland and before that it was part of the Holy Roman Empire. 

Nope, the Netherlands have been a sovereign state formally recognised at least from the peace of Westfalia (1648) on. It was a contested part of the Spanish empire between the 1580s and that date, although it run its affairs pretty much independently from its split from the Spanish Netherlands in the first date. 

Napoleon only changed the form of government from a republic into a monarchy. In 1890 it only ceded Luxembourg, which was pretty much negligible. The US invasion of Mexico and annexation of California, Colorado, Arizona, etc is much more relevant.

3253,"The first act of Croat resistance happened literally the month after NDH was founded:

*Najspektakularnija akcija iz prve faze otpora fašizmu u Zagrebu odigrala se potkraj svibnja 1941. na stadionu u Maksimiru gdje su ustaše pokušali zagrebačke srednjoškolce javno podijeliti prema nacionalnoj osnovi.*

*Događaj na stadionu u Maksimiru bio je, bez ikakve sumnje najjasniji izraz solidarnosti sa Srbima i Židovima u to vrijeme u Zagrebu i u Hrvatskoj.*

http://www.antifasisticki-vjesnik.org/hr/kalendar/5/26/7/


And then a couple months later in July 1941 the resistance attempted to liberate prisoners being held by NDH authorities:

*Bijeg iz logora Kerestinec je bio neuspio pokušaj hrvatskih komunista i uz njih vezanih pripadnika antifašističkog pokreta otpora da oslobode, odnosno od predstojeće likvidacije izbave svoje drugove i ljevičarske intelektualce koje je na početku Drugog svjetskog rata kao zatvorenike držao režim NDH.*

*Grupa od 111 hrvatskih komunista i antifašista je napala ustašku stražu i oslobodili su se. Nakon uspešnog bijega iz logora, na dogovorenom mjestu, umjesto drugova, dočekali su ih ustaše i oružnici i likvidirali ih.*

https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijeg_iz_logora_Kerestinec_1941.

And then several weeks later they firebombed Maksimir stadion:

*Paljenje stadiona 1941 je naziv za diverzantsku akciju, koju je izvela grupa zagrebačkih omladinaca 22. jula 1941 u kojoj je zapaljen veliki sokolski stadion (drveni) u Maksimiru.*

*Iako je Zagreb prvih dana ustoličenja NDH i ulaska njemačkih snaga izgledao naizgled miran i potpuno siguran grad, u njemu je ipak bilo mnogo njegovih stanovnika koji sa takvim razvojem stvari nisu bili zadovoljni. To se osobito odnosilo na skojevce i ostale mlade antifašiste. Prva veća ilegalna akcija koju su poduzeli bila je Paljenje maksimirskog stadiona.*

https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paljenje_stadiona_1941.

And then the next month in August 1941 they attacked a unit of Ustasha directly at the Botanical Garden in Zagreb:

*Dana 4. avgusta 1941. u centru Zagreba, u Runjaninovoj ulici kod Botaničkog vrta grupa omladinskih aktivista KPH i SKOJ-a izvela je napad bombama i revolverima na jednu satniju (četu) ustaškog sveučilišnog bataljona.*

*Napad je izveden nakon desetodnevnih priprema, u neposrednoj organizaciji Pokrajinskog komiteta SKOJ-a. U tom periodu provođena je partijska linija odlučnog i trenutnog prelaska na beskompromisnu oružanu borbu, a među aktivistima KPH i SKOJ-a vladalo je ubeđenje da je moguće voditi oružanu borbu protiv režima NDH i okupatora i u gradovima.*

https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napad_kod_Botani%C4%8Dkog_vrta


And then the next month in September 1941 they hit the General Post Office in Zagreb:

*Diverzija na Glavnoj pošti 1941 je naziv za veliku diverziju, koju je izvela grupa zagrebačkih ilegalaca u nedjelju 14. septembra 1941 na telefonskim postrojenjima Glavne pošte u Jurišićevoj ulici.*

*Diverzija je prouzročila i veliku materijalnu štetu na telefonskim uređajima Glavne pošte Zagreb, i višesatni prekid telefonskih veza s Bečom, Berlinom, Beogradom, Odesom i Sofijom. Telefonska centrala je popravljana sedam mjeseci. No od materijalne štete bio je puno značajniji moralni efekt akcije, - i naizgled mirni i sigurni Zagreb bio je dio fronte Drugog svjetskog rata. Važniji od toga bio je moralni efekat akcije*

That being said, while many westerners watched the news about Beirut as ""another catastrophe in the middle east"", the vast majority of French people see it a something ""real"" happening to ""real people"" in a country that most still perceive very positively (despite the civil war).

The rapid reaction of the French presidency may not be without political motive, but it is undoubtedly in line with the sentiment of the vast majority of French people.

Most importantly this crisis is unfortunately  an opportunity for some foreign powers ( Iran/syria vs Saudis) to further destabilize the country by misdirecting the popular anger.

A massive aid to the population &amp; a renewed scrutiny of the people in power by the international community is a necessity.

Unfortunately, with the Us backing the Saudi &amp;  unwilling to do anything serious to preserve peace and the EU seemingly unwilling to commit further resources someone has to push the agenda.

I feel, Macron show in Lebanon is less aimed at the Lebanese/French public than at the EU &amp;  Germany.

Greek-Turkish relations are returning to a climate of great tension, following the partial agreement between Greece and Egypt on the EEZ, with Turkey resuming drilling in the eastern Mediterranean.
""They did not keep their promises""

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Greece, arguing that Greece ""did not keep its promises.""
Unbelievable: A seven-year record for transferable ministerial staff

""There is no need to talk to those who do not have rights, especially in the sea,"" said Erdogan, who launched an attack in Athens. ""I do not recognize the agreement, for us the agreement does not exist, Greece has nothing to do with Libya or Egypt,"" he added.

""The new Greek-Egyptian agreement on the maritime zones is"" worthless ""in terms of the exclusive economic zone in the Eastern Mediterranean,"" the Turkish president added.
""I also informed Merkel""

Speaking outside Hagia Sophia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country had stopped searching for hydrocarbons at the request of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

""Merkel asked me to stop drilling. We said, ""if you trust Greece, the others, we will take a break for a few weeks, but we do not trust them."" ""They did not keep their promises and now we immediately continued the drilling work,"" he said.

At the same time, he noted that his country's agreement with Libya will be strictly observed.

""Especially in the maritime jurisdiction, we do not even need to negotiate with those who do not have rights or laws,"" Erdogan added.
Ankara's reaction is strong

Turkey's reaction to the Greece-Egypt agreement was immediate and angry.

In a statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry spoke about the non-existent maritime border between Greece and Egypt. ""There are no sea borders between Greece and Egypt. ""The so-called maritime jurisdictions, as described in the demarcation agreement signed today, are not a law for Turkey.""

""This will be proven on the front and on the table,"" Ankara said, arguing that the area is within the Turkish continental shelf.

Turkey's reaction to the Greek-Egyptian agreement was immediate and at the diplomatic level, as a few hours after the signatures of the foreign ministers, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoλουlu, was in Libya.

So yeah pretty much everyone is/has been represented. Cyprus is doing something right. People are free to believe in whatever they want. Sure there is racism, and tension between Turkish and Cypriots but that's unavoidable due to the history.

When the system isn't broken, the country grows and prospires (which it has been doing, when something's is broke the country dwells and destroys itself) which is pretty much evident by how Southern Cyprus has been progressing and developing. The gap between the North and the south will only grow wider, and this will make reunification worse on the long time and add more pressure.

I'm not saying the system doesn't need a few amends but inorder to do that you actually have to be part of it, and not expect to take total control over it. 30 percent of the seat of the parlement is certainly enough to push through your agendas, as the leading parlement has to also appeal to the votes from Turkish-Cypriots.

3679,"&gt;Everything that you said is your subjective opinion 

All-in-all, I've provided more sources than you, from researchers you yourself consider unbiased. Nothing I've said is subjective. It's very much objective.

&gt;But please stop this hypocrisy.  

Are you aware of what this word means? Or do you use it against everyone you don't like?

&gt;The numbers which are given in the articles very well show more than 20000000 people being in Gulag from 1936-1960. If you don’t understand how it works(really?)just add the amount specified infront of every year in table#1 and you’ll get number around 30000000. 

That's an idiotic way to tally convicts. Anybody with a basic grasp of mathematics should be able to tell you that.

Let's say that somebody is sentenced to 5 years. They will be counted in the tally for each of these 5 years. If someone is there for 10 years, they will be counted in the tally for each of these 10 years. 

Don't you see how just bluntly adding them up leads to massive inflation of these numbers?! Do you really consider yourself smarter than everybody else, including the top researchers of this subject?

&gt;A difference between human and a bot is that when provided with facts, human tries to investigate them and if they are true - accept them. Meanwhile a bot, repeats the same tune regardless of the facts that he’s given or objective reality. Anyway. Have a good day. 

The irony here is almost palpable. When faced with facts, you call me a bot, and smugly leave the conversation, considering yourself victorious. The good ol' ""Everyone I Don't Like Is An Unperson - A Bot"" strikes again.

Apparently, you live in a very biased paradigm, where Russia = bad, Soviet Union = bad, everything they do (including putting a man in space) = bad, and whatever they say = wrong. Also, whatever facts you dislike = wrong.

3726,"Not everything you hear should necessarily be true. Conversion to Islam was definitely not a REASON. I am not an expert as well but the reason was tensions in the are in last few decades, Turkish and Armenian gangs fighting and killing each other and innocents and doing other crimes and the final straw was some Armenians helping Russia in 1914 Russo Ottoman war. Enver Pasha was a ultranationalist, even though Gallipoli was held, costs of it was too high and for an ultranationalist to solve the problem in the east anotolia, in a time when the word of Genocide didn't exist and when the literacy of people is below 15%, was absolutely easy thing to do.

But other then this tragedy, Armenians lived as one of the most popular minorities in Ottoman empire. There were tons of high ranked bureucrats who weren't even dewshirmes, lots Armenians got educated to be palace architects and some of the most respected jobs done mainly by Armenians such as med. Doctors,  Goldsmiths etc.

&gt; There's also an insane amount of ""lost"" and ""hidden Armenians"" in Turkey who don't know that they are Armenians because their ancestors were either kidnapped as young children or their ancestors forcibly converted to Islam and never talked about their Armenian past ever again.

Again, I never heard of any survivors cuz they converted to islam. It could have been happened due to some local tribes in East maybe? But not the Ottomans doing.

There are also ones who learnt who they are after the events are passed especially the ones who take shelter in western Turkey(at least i think so cuz i met so many), the thing is we will never know what actually happened there.

Accusing the administration for what the opposition is doing, thats bullshit. 

Now as for those 14 points:

1-4... by that definition almost every country in the world is fascist, thats like shaming you for loving your own self or family.

5... Where? Women are present in the administration. That is a debunked myth.

6... By that definition, even the democrats are fascist, actually even more so than the republicans. The media has always been used as a manipulation tool. This is nothing new anywhere on the globe.

7... It was a backlash effect to the globalists attempts when the mexican-US border was threatened. Mass illegal immigration, is, well, illegal. There are laws duh... And tax-payer money goes to tax-payers. Not every person possible. Or will we act like Cuomo did with that mexican woman? Tax-payer money arent charity. 

8... I can only agree here. But the US have always been as such. Religious, strong faith. 

9-10... What? Watch Sweden on how they increased their overall wealth. It is a video where they explain how ""they are not a socialist country like Bernie claims.""

11... Where the hell did that happen. If you say suppressing sth like ""gender studies"", then bro, I totally support that. If you say ""disdain for a painting full red that is being sold for millions of dollars"", I totally support that too. Mass stupidity needs to be stopped.

12... Anddd how exactly is the defunding of police working? Crime rates higher, mhm, anything else? What sort of backlash could this POSSIBLY cause, I wonder.

If you mean Syria's presence profited Hezb., then definitely not. Hafez wasn't the easy kind to deal with and he didn't tolerate anyone who didn't fit inside of his line/Hizb. had quite a few problems with Syria early on. (They fought each other also) But it never degenerated into a full blown war since Hizb. didn't have the nec. power to deal with several enemies at the same time and generally speaking, it's not their job to clean up after others. (They also have their own interests, obviously) Also, Syria had several Lebanese factions which used to fight with it and in any case, Israel was considered a higher priority to deal with for obvious reasons.

In other words, there's a time for every battle, and not every battle has to be done with bullets.

The only reason why Syria tolerated Hezb. is because Syria wanted to regain the Golan and they ""used"" Hizb. to put pressure on Israel by having Israelis return in bodybags. If Israel ever gave back the Golan, you can be sure Hafez would have cracked down on Hizb to respect its share of the deal. 



By the advent of the Civil war in Syria, Hizb. was already superior in power to the SAA as the results of the war in this country showed. In fact, Syria owes a thousands times Hezb. for saving it and Hizb. are the ones who hold them by the balls.

This is actually what happened, not any of the nonsense which some braindead Lebanese tell themselves in their bubbles to make themselves feel good.

Incest: The story of Lot and his daughters, as can be seen in Genesis 19:30 up to 19:38.

Rape: Also the story of Lot, as Lot's daughters get him drunk to take advantage of him.

Genocide: Well, notably the great flood, where God literally kills *everybody* except for about six people, as well as two of each animal. He states that all of them were bad. Every baby? Considering you've been defending what you think our babies this whole time, how do you console yourself to the idea that your god had babies drowned for being evil? Particularly considering that he created them, and so he made them evil.

There is also in Joshua, where Joshua, with God's support, conquers the city of Jericho and [has every person inside it except for a single family who helped his spies killed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206&amp;version=NIV)

&gt;That isn't a problem you contradict yourself consistently. And no it does not contradict itself

[Sigh.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency_of_the_Bible#Contradictions)

&gt;So the USA and Ireland and basically the entire western hemisphere are similar to ISIS?

No, the Lord's Rebel Army is similar to ISIS. And the Lord's Rebel Army is the best recent example of a government built on a literal interpretation of Christianity.

&gt;Because most babies do not really ""think"" by most definition. People in comas also cannot think.

Neither of those things are true. Babies do clearly think, and even in comas people have dreams, which are a form of thought.

&gt;It literally is and science has proven this. The only difference is size and level of development. Let me ask you this did you have the same biology when you were 3 years old as you do now?

There are literally entire diseases that we treat using embryonic stem cells, but cannot be treated with the stem cells of a born human.

&gt;What is the purpose of imperialism?

It's conquest of a foreign nation.

&gt;And how do you define human rights?

With the UDHR.

&gt;Because in some countries ripping a man's anus open is considered a violation of a human right

Violence is a human rights violation in every country. I'm assuming that you are talking about violence here.

&gt;You want to invade their thoughts and ideologies and replace them with yours

No?

&gt;What do you mean indoctrinating children? So you going to have police raid people's homes and remove anything religious and ban private religion schools? How about indoctrinating children in atheism is that OK? Everyone is ""indoctrinated"" into something. Did your parents teach you right from wrong? Congrats you were indoctrinated

I want to ban religious schools, yes. Atheism should not be taught as fact, but science should be taught as fact. This includes parts of science that contradict the major religions, such as evolution.

Religion should still be a school subject, but all religions should be taught equally, and students should be encouraged to form arguments *against* religion as well as in favour.

&gt;That isn't true I don't believe you

Look up the Magdalene Laundries. Be careful though, it's quite gory and it will likely shake your approval of the Catholic Church quite a bit.

Basically, they murder Irish babies by dumping them in a septic tank and then covered it up for years. It's the absolute height of all the shitty things they did in Ireland, which also include forcing women into slavery and stealing children from single mothers to sell to Americans.

I know it sounds like insane conspiracy theory shit, but that's just how bad it is.

&gt;Why should I have to deal with liberals when I've never step foot at a Democratic convention?

Liberalism is an economic ideology that affects everyone if implemented. Christianity is a superstition.

&gt;How so? By deporting jews? France did the same thing.

Yes, and Vichy France also participated in the Holocaust.

&gt;And they can own stocks. Also you need to know what goes into running a business. Simply put the blunt truth is the ""suits"" and executives are far more valuable than the expendable honey bees. This is coming from someone who works at fast food. I do very little compared to what higher ups do

After war, most of those were sold cheaply our outright given by the new Croatian government (especially if you fought in the wars) to the people. Even today, the government has been building ""rent to own"" housing, along with ensuring better mortgage rates for the young families, and that goes doubly so for the families with kids.

In addition to that, Croatia still has alive and well culture of big family living under the same roof, with each son/daughter gettin one floor of the house. Couple that with a lot of Croatian nationals through the history working outside of the country, either as sailors, or menial workers in Germany and then returning home to build a house and retire...

For example, my family is generally poor. Father's mother was left by husband, had to raise three sons on her own. My father spent most of his life after the war as a sailor, and once he got older, he switched to just seasonal work. My mother was an immigrant from Bosnia, that came here under aged, without finished highschool, with her even younger brother during the war, got knocked up early with me, and afterwards also gave birth to my heavily autistic brother. These days my parents are divorced, dad works just during the summer, and mom was bartending until she was forced to quit and to take care of my brother.

Dad outright owns a flat, piece of land by the sea, and my mother despite being immigrant and putting her brother through highschool, managed to buy a decent plot of land with a movable home.

Do you think Greece was following international law when it decided to install a dictatorship on Cyprus with the goal of annexing the island?

Do you believe Greece is not in breach of international law when it remilitarized the demilitarized islands set out in the Lausanne and Paris treaties? If not, why not?

A bit more than slight. 45-55 is quite significant. It means that maronite parties will practically always have the power.

4244,"&gt; Are they all from the same political party?

It's Left, which is a coalition (formed to cross electoral threshold) and parliamentary club, which united three parties: SLD (= Democratic Left Alliance; post-communist turned social-democrats, still somehow bouncing after extreme fall from power in 2001), Together (""new"" socialist party) and Spring (social liberal). Spring was the newest one (and pretty weak, it was focused around one politician), and is already merging with SLD. Together is independent (actually their name is a minor meme, as they declined to ally with any other opposition until failure in 2019 EP elections; this forced them to join above).

Funnily, similar out-of-necessity coalition formed in the right-wing (Confederation, which is a merger of right wing paleolibertarian Freedom, Nationalist Movement, and paleoconservative-monarchist Crown).

And actually all powers in Polish parliament are such coalitions. PiS actually includes two minor satellite parties; KO (Civic Coalition) is mostly PO, but also three minor parties (remnant of Modern; Greens; and soclib Polish Initiative), and Polish Coalition is an out-of-necessity alliance of PSL (oldest Polish party still mattering) and remnants of Kukiz'15 (including Kukiz himself).

4293,"That's not how laws work, you can perfectly well break the law without getting in trouble or even be accused, in fact most people break laws every day without even realizing it.

One of the main issues in Poland right now is precisely that PiS is eroding the separation of powers, meaning that they have their own guys pass laws or have their own judges chosen, the law and justice won't be as independent as they should be.

And there are people being jailed that are innocent as well all the time all around the world as you certainly must know.

Several decisions by PiS are unconstitutional in the first place, but that doesn't mean anyone can do anything because they are messing with the entire system and it's safeguards and are using every loophole they can.

Hell even if you were to take things all the way, the new head of the supreme Court still has ties to the party so good luck with the law. 

It really doesn't seem like you know anything about the situation in Poland.

Even something like making things exceptionally difficult for Poles abroad to vote because they know that's a demographic that doesn't support them might not be illegal but it's still a huge democratic issue. 

People aren't protesting in the streets with chants of ""constitution"" etc or mocking the party's name just because they dislike the party line.

It was put into power under France's rule of the territory, but local actors helped craft the constitution and enforce it for their own gain. I don't think their agency should be overlooked. In particular, the christians decision to lobby France for a *Grand Liban* instead of the option of a *Petit Liban* where they would have had an unassailable majority is what necessitated the confessional system in the first place. So lebanese christian greed, and in particular maronite greed if I'm remembering correctly, was a massive determinate factor in how the history unfolded. Grand Liban ultimately lead to their civil war and the tilting of power away from the christians in the enlarged state and ultimately towards the shias backed by Iran. The inciting factors of their civil war, were the already present refugee camps of stateless outsider sunnis who were made ineligible for naturalization, and the addition of PLO agitators who were just kicked out of Jordan for attempting to rise up and overthrow the government there.",עם ישראל חי,/r/europe/comments/i4r0w8/44000_sign_petition_for_france_to_take_control_of/g0lspb5/,adlerchen,1596747112

4341,"So, I didn’t watch the videos entirely(and I actually skipped the second one, I’ll explain why), but I grabbed some numbers from the first video and I’ll talk a bit about last 2. 
First of all, I think it will be honest to notice that Goblin as well as Jukov are biased. And it’s so strange that you call Dud’ and his numbers unreliable, while giving me links to Goblins channel. A simple thought that Goblin is a reliable source of history and real numbers is ridiculous. It is well known that Goblin is an expolice officer(there is no such thing as ex cop or ex kgb in ussr or russia, everyone knows that) and he is proPutin, progovernment and honestly I think he cares about nothing but personal profit. 
Regarding a well known communist Klim Jukov I won’t even start... 
However, even despite them making fun of Dud’ , and being subjective throughout the video while presenting no real evidence or links, I saved some of the numbers that they are talking about, let’s discuss. 
Actually they are bringing up numbers several times in the course of the first video. First time at 21:53 - he says that Dud’ was talking about around million prisoners being in Kolyma on a specific decade. He calls it bs, and says that there were actually only 809604 prisoner at that specific period(pretty much around million, no?!). 
Then at 46:37 - they show a part of the film where Roman Romanov says that there were around 20000000 prisoners in Gulag from 1923-1956 and 2 million died. He questions this information, asks for links that prove such numbers, finally calls it bs too and gives some random numbers taken from nowhere. He doesn’t give a specific source of those numbers, and doesn’t link to anything at all. Prolly pulled out of the a. 
Now, even though Dud’ in his video really doesn’t link to any sources and didn’t present evidence for those numbers(20000000), I found them myself. Actually guess what 20 million is an underestimated number. 
According to various articles and books by demographers V.N. Zemskov, A.N. Dugin and etc. the number of prisoners of Gulag from 1920s to 1953 was around 25-30 million people. Based on these numbers it’s not too difficult to assume that around 2 million people could have died in those camps, and probably many more. Mind you this information comes from demographers not some amateur youtubers protecting governments interests on the net(aka Kremlin bots) and you can find their works easily. Those were main points of the video, I was tired of their biased conversation so I jumped to the next video. 
Actually I skipped the second Puchkovs video, as I said I honestly don’t think he’s interested in knowing or telling the truth and it shows. 
Also as soon as the dude in the third video brought up Navalni, I skipped him too. Just an unknown person trying to make some noise for himself. 
I mean the like/dislike ratio pretty much explains what people think of those “creations”. 
The fourth and the last video actually was pretty informative and gave insight to who exactly Dud’ was interviewing. However, it didn’t have anything to do with the overall topic of the film. Dud’ always interviews people with different opinions, even biased people, and always shows opposite points of view. 
The overall message of the movie was that there is fear. And it’s true. When you see, for example, how right now in Khabarovsk people rebel against the corrupted Russian government, but everyone else in other cities “supports” them in comments section, but can’t do anything practical- this is fear. In my opinion not much changed since ussr authoritarian regime. Yes there are some freedoms now, it’s probably easier to live but at the end of the day, you disagree - you die.",,/r/europe/comments/i4mdwf/on_6_august_1961_the_soviet_cosmonaut_gherman/g0lt239/,6-agony-6,1596747276

To bring the point closer to home, how is East Germany doing? After 30 years of one of the richest and most developed economies in the world pouring literally trillions into their economy.

And they were:

* literally the same ethnicity, religion, etc. as the rest of Germany
* spoke the same language as the rest of Germany
* were surrounded by many trade partners right next door, almost all of them developed countries or developing very rapidly (Poland)
* white (so 0 racism to fight against while trying to trade, get jobs, get investments)

30 years later and only now their GDP per capita is kind of approaching the poorer West German state levels.

Heck, in next-door Poland, you can still see the partition lines from 1918 (!) in many maps of population density, political preferences, etc.

If you wish to know why the marshall of the Sejm is the president of Poland according to the constitution: 

- On 3 June 2020, the Marshal of the Sejm ordered the first round of the election to be held on 28 June 2020.
- *why the Election on 28 june 2020 are UNCONSTITUTIONAL*?  art 128.2 of the Polish constitution: ""The election of the President of the Republic shall be ordered by the Marshal of the Sejm to be held **on a day no sooner than 100 days and no later than 75 days before expiry of the term of office of the serving President of the Republic**, and **in the event of the office of President of the Republic falling vacant** - no later than the 14th day thereafter(...)"". 
- June 28 was 70 days before the expiry on the 6th of August. So the true election has to be announced within 14 days after the office of president is vacated. So the Speaker of the Sejm can announce new election AT THE EARLIEST after 6th of August. [source]( https://natemat.pl/310055,wybory-prezydenckie-beda-28-czerwca-dr-mikolaj-malecki-niekonstytucyjne)

- ANY new law signed by Duda starting August 6 will have no power at all. I can also sign a document saying the moon is the sun and it has the same legal power as his signature.

Not to nitpick here but if you asked any historian about the British empire in India they would say the same thing... Infact the British adopted some Indian customs and culture and brought them back to the UK. Yet that is still very much seen as a act of colonisation by the Indians.. Even though India didn't exist back then...... 

I'd argue that modern day Greeks would still see the turks as colonisers and since it seams to be the  ""victims"" of imperialism we side with these days if the Greeks say that the turks where colonisers then who are we to say otherwise?

But human beings at every level of society have to hold their tongues and appease people they don't like because it could result in them losing a job etc. Most people here will identify with wanting to tell a rude customer to fuck off. It's the same principle. You tolerate them and stay quiet because they have something you need.

4829,"1. Do you really think everyone has a equal chance in a democracy? The concept of inheritance and many other factors heavily favour certain people and their families, royals would just be one family more

2. You don't have to be religious to support a figurehead ruler, the reason of their existence might not align with said views but it can't change their views and logical process on a system who's functioning barely relates to religion above the cerenomial.

3. You were claiming that somehow the problems that the Weimar Republic was riddled with was caused by the German Monarchy, the only thing that can be interpreted as the Monarchy of Germany causing the problems would be them losing the war, the reparations and failed democratic government was formed and orchestrated by the Entente powers.

4. Democracy is completely fine and I agree with it in many ways, and Monarchies can be unnecessary in many countries, Monarchy in many European nations benefit the country with tourism and providing national unity and legitimacy to the democratic government, Monarchs in such countries have extremely limited power and will usually just do what people expect them to. As for the increased taxes argument, the money given is insignificant down to individual people, anyways, it's really not like they'd still have way more advantages and influence than average people if we stripped them of their powers. I think a Constitutional Monarch without any real powers can help unify and complete a Democracy if the Monarch is able to stay as a apolitical figure to represent ideals and the culture of the country.

Anyways, I would like to apologize for the insult at the first message, was really not in a good mood lol, I would also like to clarify that I do not support in any way a Absolute Monarchy like those from the past, and only support Constitutional Monarchy in few cases where dissolution of said Monarchy wouldn't be beneficial to the country or even harmful",,/r/europe/comments/i3p6tw/spain_amid_scandal_support_for_the_monarchy_sinks/g0jnmk7/,apollos123,1596711020

- June 28 was 70 days before the expiry on the 6th of August. So the true election have to be announced within 14 days after the office of president is vacated. So the Speaker of the Sejm can announce new elections AT THE EARLIEST after 6th of August. [source]( https://natemat.pl/310055,wybory-prezydenckie-beda-28-czerwca-dr-mikolaj-malecki-niekonstytucyjne)

While some countries like Germany massively benefitted since 1 Marco value was almost 2euro instead italian lira rates were 1000lire = 0,50€. This killed italian export having a massive effects on what's is italian core business aka small-medium companies. Also Europe is perceived only as a banking system. Not a real union. Else Europe and its countries would enact a reform regarding health,schools,fiscal system, political system and also italians really dislike massive illegal migration from Africa and with Shengen pact all of those who get in Italy must they there. Meaning even if they want to leave for France or Germany they aren't allowed to. So it's really a complex problem. I agree at Italexit or Quitaly done without thiking would lead to a massive economical disaster in the short term but done in a smart manner wouldn't be that tragic over all. A smarter way wouldn't be doing it like Great Britain but doing it  together with some South Europe countries like Spain and Greece and maybe France.

5047,"Finally someone who got it at least partially right. The **world system created in 1944 in Bretton Woods was created to strategically compete with the Soviet Union**. Block vs Block. We swim and protect your ships, you don't need a navy (too big) and military spendings, but in exchange you support us against USSR led block.

This deal cannot work without a strategic reason because it NEVER served US for the economic reasons. US hardly exported anything of their GDP outside themselves and outside NAFTA. **Contrary to exactly all other participants** of the free world system.

WHEN the SU collapsed the reason of US involvement in the world affairs in this scale and engagement faded, so, over time US involvement itself started to fade. It really started soon after Bush senior era ended. Clinton was the first president to focus more on american closest neighborhood lifting up NAFTA and since the beginning of the 90's the number of US soldier deployed had nothing but gradually shrunk with a short break for the Iraqi first years of war. Now it's again at it's historical lowest because both Obama and Trump brought soldiers home.

And of course, the structures of the free world after the SU collapse extended their range with NATO enlargement, new WTO participants and so on. But it was only caused by inertia after the SU collapse when left alone countries needed new markets and stability. **But the reasons why US is in the system went gone and it less and less served US interest**. The SU was defeated, the world system led by US played it's role, the reason why it was created is gone and the US gradually but consequently were pushing themselves out if it.

This block vs block strategy cannot fit competing with China. China is already inside of it and turned it to serve them. Besides, there won't be a bipolar world like in the cold war. There's nobody strong enough to be a single second pole. We will have a multi-polar world with a set of active actors. In these conditions you're not building blocks but supporting single countries who are in trouble to leverage them against others so as the result the eternal goal of oceanic empires - not letting Eurasia to merge into one super-state is preserved.

**Trump didn't change the course of anything really** when it comes to FA. He only fastened the process that started 30 years ago. The **United States are leaving the role of policing the world**, this role doesn't serve United States anymore. And **you are on your own**.

5119,"&gt; No. Every single political theorist alive today disagrees with the communism = fascism argument. Fascism supports corporatism and private property, while communism bases itself around the abolition of private ownership of the means of production. Fascism is also inherently nationalistic, while Marx was an internationalist. Finally, the end goal of Marxism is the abolition of the state, while in fascism the state holds ultimate power.
&gt; 
&gt; As well as this, every fascist leader agreed that communism is an existential enemy to them.

I didn't say they were the same but they do have similarities. No fascism is anti capitalistic. And yeah the end goal of Marxism is to abolish the state after the state has gained ultimate power

&gt;The official name of North Korea is the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. The official name means very little.

What does that have to do with what I said? How about this they believed the rich's money should be redistributed to the poor

&gt;China and Vietnam have transitioned to market economies, and North Korea considers itself to be Juche, not communist. (Though I can see the argument there)

yeah because they saw what happened to the USSR and the insufficiency of communism yet they still wave their communist flags and claim to be communist

&gt;Right now, democratically elected Marxist parties are in power in Nepal, Ethiopia, Kerala, and Cuba. They have previously elected to power in Chile, Bolivia, Honduras, Grenada, and Guatemala, though each of those was overthrown by a US-backed coup or invasion.

did you seriously call any of those countries democratic? Nepal is a chinese puppet state that abolished its monarchy for that reason and Ethiopia and Cuba are both hell holes. I don't know anything about Kerala 

And most of those governments were A. not marxist at most socialist and B. already had revolution that lead to them being overthrown. As an example Salvador Allende tanked Chile's economy and began censoring protests leading to Pinochet to overthrow him. Jacobo Arbenz also allowed people to trespass on private property and stealing goods off it while not paying the money he promised to companies for the land. He was also a racist towards natives

&gt;The 100 million number is including deaths by starvation, in which case capitalism actually has a higher death toll, with 20 million people starving to death in capitalist system each year.

Oh these were much more than just starvation they intentionally starved and horded food from certain people. Others were just thrown in jail and tortured until they died. Also which countries are you talking about? Virtually every 1st world country has food programs and charities

&gt;Russia, China, and Cuba all became richer, more industrialised, and stronger during communism. I dislike each of those regimes, but they weren't failures.

No they didn't. And yes they were ultimately failures because they did away with communism. The USSR straight up collapsed 

[Cuba before and after Castro.](https://babalublog.com/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cuba-before-after-castro.jpg) They also never were industrial and have started to open back up to jump start a tourist market with the joke these days being it is a luxury to work as a door hop but a disappointment to be a neurosurgeon. They became ""strong"" because Russia funded them as a satellite state

As for Russia under the Tsar Russia was modernizing incredibly fast so much so a [french economist named Edmond Théry said it would be the economic powerhouse by 1950 back in 1914.](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/russia-eve-first-world-war#:~:text=In%20May%201913%20a%20prominent,modern%20agricultural%20and%20industrial%20superpower.) Russia was also the [first country to use electric trams](http://odessatrolley.com/Maps_Historic/Map1910-11.htm) which became wasted under the USSR, Nicholas II also signed the October Manifesto which included the Duma making him a constitutional monarch and [more people were being educated than ever before](http://www.events.orthodoxengland.org.uk/the-russia-we-lost/) and even blocked efforts to limit rights to jew

5164,"I will gladly point to the other country with enough nukes to end the world, because it's relevant. All your information regarding Russia comes ultimately from Washington. The same power structure spying on the leaders of the EU, that has nukes and military troops in these countries. I am very skeptical of any Western narative as a result. 

I don't think Russia is completely innocent of everything it's being accused of because I have no way of knowing, in reality. What I am not doing is choosing to trust the American side of the story blindly. I am taking into account both narratives. In an ideal world I could be just as critical as both, but given how powerful the US is and how obviously corrupt it is, I am forced to focus more on them than on Russia.

If you were honestly seeking the truth, you would listen to the narratives pushed by both sides. I doubt you're going to do that, but I will direct you to Putin's Munich speech, his Financial Times interview, and Oliver Stone's documentary ""The Putin Interviews"". You will find rhetoric from him that you are not even aware of if I were to guess, because Western media actively suppresses it.

What I want is for America to stop having so much influence in Europe. Once that happens I will happily take another look at whatever Russia gets accused of then, but given the source of these accusations, ultimately, I have no choice but to ignore it as such. There are things more important than partaking in a narrative that serves NATO's purposes in a world where we need to get rid of nuclear weapons and do many other things besides that have to involve Russia. This strategy that the EU has partaken in is not wise. It has pushed Russia towards China, and that is a much more significant problem than your disagreements about how Russia works internally.

I have been multiple times, and yes, [there is massive poverty in Scotland.](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/poverty-scotland-2019)

&gt;Regardless when you brought up how London is disproportionately wealthy

I didn't say it was disproportionately wealthy, (though it is) I said that outside of London there is very little wealth. Most places in Ireland have very low levels of poverty. The same is not true in the UK.

&gt;do you think Roe v Wade was wrong because it was the federal court that decided abortion was okay not the people?

Yes? Abortion had never legally been banned. Roe v Wade didn't legalise abortion, it just confirmed that it had always been legal, something that was factually true.

Regardless, abortion also falls into the human rights thing, with the United Nations Human Rights Committee confirming that abortion falls under the right to bodily autonomy.

&gt;since secular countries won't use the bible as the basis

You keep bringing up the Bible. Have you actually read the Bible? Because there are a lot of things in there that I think will make you gawk. God repeatedly comes down on the side of pro-incest, pro-slavery, pro-genocide, ect. He fucks people over constantly for literally no reason.

It also contradicts itself constantly, making it impossible to base a government on it without just choosing to ignore the parts you don't like.

Any government based on the Bible is more similar to ISIS than a country. In fact, we saw that to be true with the Lord's Rebel Army, a Christian terrorist group that previously controlled large parts of East Africa, abusing the local people in a way that I'm sure you (but not the bible) would describe as unchristian.

&gt;And btw were these documents and councils chosen democratically? So what one council of bureaucrats decided to rewrite what defines a human it doesn't make it right. Hitler once defined a human as not a Jew.

Are you actually comparing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to Hitler's race theories?

&gt;Cut off a piece of your skin tissue and get tissue from a fetus and ask a doctor to analyze both and tell you which one is not human.

It would be pretty easy to tell which one is the fetus. Theirs a reason why we use fetal tissue for stem cell treatments, and it's because fetal stem cells are much more adaptable, being capable of changing to fix problems much more fluidly than adult stem cells can.

Regardless, that's irrelevant. The reason I don't consider them human is that they literally do not have a brain. They cannot think. Using your skin tissue example, we would have more in common there with a corpse than with a fetus.

&gt;Seriously bro why are you a science denier?

Not gonna be called a science denier by someone who thinks fetal tissue is identical to a full-grown human's tissue.

&gt;AKA you want the middle east to cow tow to your beliefs and standards.

I want religious extremism to not exist. So, in this aspect, yes.

&gt;Again european imperialism never ended.

Agreed, but this isn't it. The Americans and various European allies invading the middle east constantly are imperialism. Wanting human rights is not.

Last time I checked, I'm not leading an invasion of the middle east right now.

&gt;Please define enforce your religion on others?

* Forcing somebody to worship.

* Banning somebody from an activity for religious reasons.

* Indoctrinating children into a religion.

ect ect.

&gt;That is like me saying liberals have no right to enforce their beliefs onto me through legislature.

No, it isn't. That's stupid.

&gt;Even then most countries already have either officially or de facto have freedom from religious law and oppression.

I grew up as a non-Muslim in Abu Dhabi. Believe me when I say that isn't true.

Even here in Ireland theirs still church influence, and the Catholic Church still isn't punished when they cover up pedophilia or kill children for being born out of wedlock.

&gt;And if freedom to promote religion isn't a human right what can I promote?

You can promote religion. You can't force it on people. Somebody who never steps foot inside a church should never have to deal with religion.

&gt;And btw secularism originated from the west and no where else really

There have been large scale independent secular movements as far as China and Turkey.

&gt;Giovanni Gentile and Mussolini committed genocide?

Both took part in the Holocaust, so yes, they definitely did.

&gt;I acknowledge classism but depending on the context it isn't a bad thing like you say.

How so? Classism is effectively the discrimination based on social class.

&gt;If it is barring someone from buying a ferrari because they are broke then no it isnt wrong.

That isn't classism.

This should help clear up misunderstandings; https://classism.org/about-class/what-is-classism/

&gt;How much stocks have you put into the company you work at?

I believe that stocks should be owned by the workers of the company. They are the one actually making its value, after all.

What does an investor do? He puts in a bit of money and then leaves to sit on his arse. It's the factory workers, shopkeepers, ect who are actually doing the work that keeps the company functioning. Why shouldn't they profit off of it?

Realistically, I know this isn't going to happen any time soon, and would be more than happy to accept something like 20% of all companies' stock being owned collectively by the workers.

&gt;And abolition billionaires? What are you going to do force them to give a certain amount of money to the government?

Just take it through taxes.

Nobody earns a billion dollars. They, like in the abovementioned example, simply invest money and let all the workers beneath them do the actual work. That money should be more spread throughout the economy.

As well as that, billionaires are a net drain on the economy. The thing with money is that it has to keep moving for an economy to work. Every time you spend money, that generates economic activity, yes?

Well, the overwhelming majority of billionaires simply hoard most of their money. We're faced with the problem; nobody actually wants to buy enough stuff that spending a billion dollars would be necessary.

And so most of it lies in their bank account, useless to the economy as a whole. On the other hand, a poor person will spend most of their income, creating more economic activity. This is an economic concept know as [the Marginal Propensity to Consume,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalpropensitytoconsume.asp#:~:text=In%20economics%2C%20the%20marginal%20propensity,as%20opposed%20to%20saving%20it.) and it is one of the main reasons why the richer a person is, the less useful they are to the economy.

[Here's an article showing it in action.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/better-economic-growth-when-wealth-distributed-to-poor-instead-of-rich)

&gt;Also workers can't run a worker place and if they could then they'd get promoted. That idea would inevitably lead to another hierarchical system where one ""worker"" becomes essentially the boss.

Yes, a worker would be the boss, but the workers would have the power to hire and fire that boss, creating a form of democracy in the workplace. This will lead to better treatment for the workers. The concern would be that the workers will be lazy and vote for less hours ect, but seeing as now they have these stocks, how much money they make is directly tied to how well the company does, leading to them having an interest in working to make the company successful.

&gt;and what do you mean no landlords?

Landlords, similarly, don't actually do anything. They don't create the land, that was made naturally. (or I guess you'd say it's made by god, but either way) They don't build the house either, that's construction workers. So what do they do?

The landlord buys the house, and then essentially is allowed to put a tax on the person who actually lives there in the form of rent.

A landlord doesn't actually produce anything for society. They don't build the house or create the land, but they do take wealth from the person living on that land, who most of the time is someone who does produce for society.

&gt;So when does a fetus become a baby? Can you abort a fetus at 30 weeks?

90% of abortions take place within the first 12 weeks, when the fetus has no capability for thought or pain.

I do oppose abortion when it is late enough that the fetus can think and feel pain. Here in Ireland at least, abortion is only legal during those first 12 weeks.

&gt;can I kill animals whenever I want to?

5220,"&gt;In fact fascism and Nazism are really just racially driven marxism since both oppose capitalism and personal liberties.

No. Every single political theorist alive today disagrees with the communism = fascism argument. Fascism supports corporatism and private property, while communism bases itself around the abolition of private ownership of the means of production. Fascism is also inherently nationalistic, while Marx was an internationalist. Finally, the end goal of Marxism is the abolition of the state, while in fascism the state holds ultimate power.

As well as this, every fascist leader agreed that communism is an existential enemy to them.

&gt;I mean nazi is literally just national socialism

The official name of North Korea is the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. The official name means very little.

&gt;this is despite the fact every communist country to ever exist and every communist country that still exists like China, North Korea and Vietnam are the biggest abusers of human rights?

China and Vietnam have transitioned to market economies, and North Korea considers itself to be Juche, not communist. (Though I can see the argument there)

&gt;Marxism requires a dictatorial leader

Right now, democratically elected Marxist parties are in power in Nepal, Ethiopia, Kerala, and Cuba. They have previously elected to power in Chile, Bolivia, Honduras, Grenada, and Guatemala, though each of those was overthrown by a US-backed coup or invasion.

&gt;Marxism... murder over 100 million people.

The 100 million number is including deaths by starvation, in which case capitalism actually has a higher death toll, with 20 million people starving to death in capitalist system each year.

&gt;Historically, a kiosk (from Persian kūshk) was a small garden pavilion open on some or all sides common in Persia, the Indian subcontinent, and in the Ottoman Empire from the 13th century onward. 
&gt;Etymological data points to the Middle Persian word kōšk 'palace, portico' as the origin, via Turkish köşk 'pavilion' and French kiosque or Italian chiosco

Oh, and regarding Kåldolme (cabbage roll): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage_roll#Sweden_and_Finland
&gt;As indicated by the name, Swedish kåldolmar are generally considered a variety of the dolma. In 1709, after losing the Battle of Poltava, the wounded Charles XII of Sweden and the remnants of his army escaped with their Cossack allies to the Ottoman town of Bender, in present-day Moldavia, where they were granted refuge by Sultan Ahmed III. Charles XII spent more than five years in the Ottoman Empire, trying to convince the Sultan to help him defeat the Russians. When he finally returned to Sweden in 1715, he was followed by Ottoman creditors from whom he had borrowed money. The creditors remained in Sweden at least until 1732; it is generally believed that Ottoman style dolma were introduced into Swedish cooking during this period.

China doesn't. It's a backwater, a throwback to the worst times of human history (see the Uighur video from yesterday).

China's economic development is due to several factors but it doesn't change the fact that China won't be a wealthy country per capita anytime soon.

And economic growth doesn't just go on forever. 

China's GDP per capita is slightly better than Brazil. So there's that. No one lauds Brazil.

5320,"&gt; You're supposed to bring the restrictions back if things get bad again

Except that things are actually pretty OK now. Out of 5232 active cases, only 121 people are hospitalized at the moment. That's just 2 % of them and far below the numbers required to fill the available ICU capacity. In addition, the growth has been pretty linear for the last 3 weeks.

Lockdowns, masks and similar measures were always sold to the population here as a measure to protect the healthcare system against situation that was, at the moment of our first wave, happening in Italy. The restrictions back then were extreme and their impact on both personal and bussines freedoms pretty large. Yet the people followed them out of fear of the virus, which was also fueled by public speculations by government officials such as: “Maybe we'll have to keep the borders sealed for up to two years.” (This was said by the then-top government epidemiologist.)

I would say that the severity of the early restrictions (especially in contrast to the real situation here that has never even approached dangerous levels) really made Czechs bitter and unwilling to continue following them voluntarily. Personal experience: We were really discouraged from visiting our older family members. My grandmother lives alone and was basically locked in her home without any personal contact for a month. It was her who demanded us to start visiting her again after that time, saying basically this: “Don't be afraid of infecting me. I am old and death is always a possibility at this age. I want to live, but this is not a life. You can't even imagine what it is like to live alone at this age.” As for masks, well, maybe they wouldn't be so loathed today if we weren't made to feel like lawbreakers when not wearing them in a park far from people.

&gt; If we all keep at it, we can keep the virus at bay.

For how long we can continue with restrictions? Even if we are lucky and a vaccine is ready at the end of the year, it will be at least a year from now before it's widely deployed to the point of being effective. That is, if a vaccine can really be made (it's likely, but not certain), is affordable, made quickly enough and people adopt it (remember anti-vaxxers). But even if we have to wait “only” a year, our economies simply cannot afford another even partial shutdown.

In the end, I'm all for localized measures to guard against exponential escalation, spread in hospitals and among the elderly, contact tracing and other rational decisions. But further lockdowns, mandatory masks outside, closed schools, etc. on the national level simply aren't possible here anymore (without public anger and destruction of whole sectors of economy).",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/i461wl/how_often_do_you_wear_a_face_and_nosecovering/g0ic33x/,DevilSauron,1596675352

clearly you haven't. What does that mean? You think Glasgow and Aberdeen are poor?

&gt;I do care about them, and have repeatedly advocated for the Irish government to put a greater focus on the west. However, I think you severly overestimate how poor non-Dublin Ireland is. Large parts of Connacht and Donegal are quite poor. Leinster and Munster are both very rich.

Then I think you are underestimating the poverty in non London UK is. Regardless when you brought up how London is disproportionately wealthy I brought up how disproportionately wealthy Dublin is and you barely responded to it

&gt;Yes.

&gt;As long as the constitution is adopted democratically, yes, change it as much as you like.

So everything changed by the Irish government is democratic? Ok do you think Roe v Wade was wrong because it was the federal court that decided abortion was okay not the people?

&gt;The point of a constitution is to lay out the basis of the government.

I disagree. It is meant to prevent the government from abusing its power since secular countries won't use the bible as the basis but instead plagiarize it

&gt;Universal means applies to all human beings. (And because you're about to say it, no, a fetus is not considered a human being. This has already been established by the UNHRC.)

And also any time. And btw were these documents and councils chosen democratically? So what one council of bureaucrats decided to rewrite what defines a human it doesn't make it right. Hitler once defined a human as not a Jew. Cut off a piece of your skin tissue and get tissue from a fetus and ask a doctor to analyze both and tell you which one is not human. It is psalms coming true. These people have made themselves into gods and they get to chose what is a human and what isn't regardless of science. Seriously bro why are you a science denier?

&gt;Freedom to promote religion isn't a human right, and freedom of expression doesn't allow you to enforce your religion on others. Freedom from religion is meant to protect you from religious law and oppression.

AKA you want the middle east to cow tow to your beliefs and standards. Again european imperialism never ended. Please define enforce your religion on others? That is like me saying liberals have no right to enforce their beliefs onto me through legislature. Even then most countries already have either officially or de facto have freedom from religious law and oppression. And if freedom to promote religion isn't a human right what can I promote? Is freedom to promote atheism a human right?

And btw secularism originated from the west and no where else really

&gt;The founders of fascism committed genocide and the ideology specifically includes getting rid of ""inferior"" people. Communism does not include this, and Karl Marx was not genocidal. (Though he did have some racist opinions which I vehemently disagree with)

Giovanni Gentile and Mussolini committed genocide? Have you read the doctrine of fascism?

&gt;Acknowledging that classism exists =/= communism.

I acknowledge classism but depending on the context it isn't a bad thing like you say. If barring someone from elections or certain rights is what you mean then classism is wrong. If it is barring someone from buying a ferrari because they are broke then no it isnt wrong. But poor and rich people are going to exist within a capitalist society or really any society for that matter

&gt;I am a socialist. I want the abolition of landlords and billionaires, and want worker-run workplaces.

How much stocks have you put into the company you work at? And abolition billionaires? What are you going to do force them to give a certain amount of money to the government? Also workers can't run a worker place and if they could then they'd get promoted. That idea would inevitably lead to another hierarchical system where one ""worker"" becomes essentially the boss. Even then what about financial things that some workers may not know how to operate?

and what do you mean no landlords? 

&gt;I do think babies deserve rights. I don't think fetuses deserve rights.

So when does a fetus become a baby? Can you abort a fetus at 30 weeks? What about partial birth abortions? Do you think all human beings deserve rights?

BTW you never answered my question of can I kill animals whenever I want to?

&gt;If ""genocide is bad"" is my ideology, then sure, I only like democracy when it fits my ideology.

Great then you oppose Marxism. Fascism is not innately genocidal and there is no mention to genocide in Mussolini and Gentile's books. In fact fascism and Nazism are really just racially driven marxism since both oppose capitalism and personal liberties. I mean nazi is literally just national socialism aka rich jews give their money to poor germans. Regardless marxism has lead to numerous genocides

&gt;If democratically elected, yeah. I think the current Marxist party in Ireland aren't very competent and I'd disagree with them on some things, but I doubt they'd be much worse than our current government, and theirs some progressive policies I want that we might finally get.

this is despite the fact every communist country to ever exist and every communist country that still exists like China, North Korea and Vietnam are the biggest abusers of human rights? You wouldn't accept a democratically elected fascist but you will accept a democratically elected marxist despite both being responsible for atrocities. Marxism requires a dictatorial leader to rule over the people and although Marx envisioned the government withering away he clearly didn't take into account that those in power aren't going to give up power. Marxism is the only thing that enables men like Stalin, Mao or Pol Pot to murder over 100 million people. Though if Im honest I'd be less concern of a marxist coming to power than a fascist because I doubt a marxist could actually achieve their goals compared to fascists

5406,"&gt;Britain and Japan will on Thursday attempt to thrash out a post-Brexit free trade agreement, although the UK admits a deal might only boost British GDP by 0.07 per cent and would be a bigger prize for Japanese exporters.  Liz Truss, UK trade secretary, and Toshimitsu Motegi, Japan’s foreign minister, will hold talks in London with the aim of wrapping up a trade deal that both sides have tried to rush through in a matter of months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Among the sticking points are Tokyo’s demands for cuts in tariffs on Japanese car exports, while the UK is holding out for better access for services, including new rules on data regulation, and for agriculture.  Ms Truss will hail this as the first major trade deal signed by Britain since Brexit, although it will largely replicate the terms of the agreement between Japan and the EU that came into force in February 2019.  
&gt;  
&gt;Japan has insisted in negotiations with London that any deal with Britain cannot be as ambitious as the one it signed with the EU, given that the UK is a much smaller market.      If Japan thought that the UK and EU were going to settle a new deal, it would not feel this urgent  
&gt;  
&gt;Senior Japanese official  Britain’s trade department estimated earlier this year that a “modelled” trade deal between the two sides “could increase UK GDP in the long run by 0.07 per cent”.  
&gt;  
&gt;That compares with a Treasury estimate that Britain could lose around 5 per cent of potential GDP over 15 years under Boris Johnson’s plan to take Britain out of the EU single market and customs union.  The UK trade department has also estimated that while the trade deal could see a 21 per cent rise in UK exports of goods and services to Japan, imports from the country are estimated to increase by 79 per cent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nevertheless both see the deal as important, with Tokyo anxious to ensure continued privileged access to the UK market after Brexit, rather than trading on World Trade Organization terms.  It is the first overseas trip by a Japanese minister since the coronavirus took hold in March and the UK remains on Japan’s list of countries whose nationals are currently denied entry.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a precaution, the Japanese team will spend the three-day visit in a self-imposed bubble, allowing themselves only to move between their hotel and the negotiation table, with no other meetings allowed.   Mr Motegi is arriving in the UK with what members of his team describe as “reasonable hope” that agreement on the outstanding issues can be struck by Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Japan is approaching the talks with some urgency, with its disquiet focused on what will happen on January 1. “If Japan thought that the UK and EU were going to settle a new deal, it would not feel this urgent,” said one senior Japanese official.  
&gt;  
&gt;Officials in Tokyo said Japan was not optimistic about the UK’s talks with Brussels and was working on the assumption that Boris Johnson’s government was unlikely either to extend the transition period with the EU beyond that date, or to finalise a deal with the bloc.  
&gt;  
&gt;If Britain and the EU failed to secure a trade deal, it would leave Japanese companies based in the UK — including car companies — facing tariffs for imported parts from continental Europe.  If Ms Truss and Mr Motegi succeed in finalising a trade deal, it would at least allow Japanese companies in Britain to look to Japan as an alternative source of tariff-free components.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There will be a few tweaks compared with the EU deal,” said David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project. “It’s not going to be phenomenal, but at least both sides want to do it.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Japan’s eagerness to reach a deal with the UK is not only about trade; the visit by Mr Motegi provides a chance to discuss bilateral co-operation on security and defence, as Tokyo eyes the ever-increasing regional ambitions of China.  Japan has noted the UK’s stronger tone recently towards China on issues such as Hong Kong and Huawei and sees a trade deal as a way to strengthen ties.   “Every discussion about trade under \[prime minister Shinzo\] Abe has always had a strategic component,” said Tobias Harris, senior vice-president at Teneo, the corporate advisory firm.

5416,"The mentality is identical, big twats aiming to be the big man while simultaneously asserting their power by picking on weaker enemies. 

If you are too blinded by the theatre of it all to see through the bullshit to the real heart of what's actually going on the maybe you need to be the one to understand.

Listen to how people speak and see how they act in local, national and international political levels. It's all really just overinflated teenage and young adult bullshit taken up a notch, instead of teenage boys worrying about their girlfriend seeing someone else it's all about worrying about which countries are dealing with who behind each others back.
Whose got the nicest car and the most money becomes who's got the best military and the most money. Who's cool, who's not cool.

Diplomacy is diplomacy, whether you're negotiating for a loan, a business deal or international politics the stakes are higher but the techniques are largely the same - try and get something that benefits both parties and both parties agree on.While his is genuinely an over simplification as with anything the steps are clearly defined and easily learnt.

Humans are human you are as much like your neighbour as you are to even the remotest of tribes. Just because it seems like some deep tactical manoeuvre it's roots are firmly in the realm of bullying for the sake of winding people up and asserting some form of dominance.  

Go to any bar and don't participate just observe and you'll see and hear world politics in action guys posturing to each other, groups talking behind each others backs about each other, you'll see people trying to woo other for drinks, sex or whatever(usually women coming on to guys for free drinks based on the knowledge the guy is expecting sex in return which they may or may not go forward with.) There'll be displays of prowess and affection, maybe a fight and reconciliation.

It really is condensed world politics in a nutshell, the more day to day actions are more akin to what happens in the business world and happens over a longer period of time but te actions are the same , wooing another company as they have something to offer and want something in return from a quick deal on a regular supply of goods to a full blown takeover. There'll be posturing, guided factory tours, free gifts, negotiations and some form of deal at the end or the other party may just take the free gifts and decide not to go through with any deal at that time.Again we're back to general Saturday night fare for the average person. 

The UN are a step above, deals (in the form of peace treaties) they have to deal with the posturing and back biting and really the UN Secretary general is just a school headmaster keeping peace and order.

So yeah after half a lifetime focused on politics, reading publications such as Private Eye and various books by Danny Dorling and Tony Benn i can tell you at all levels humanity carries out actions that may seem wildly different but they come from the same roots.

And congratulations for praising a government for doing what they're supposed to do. Bettering the economy.

Also, do you know who really improved the economy? Chinese people. When the CCP finally let them trade relatively freely, they built, created businesses from factories to fresh fruit. Notice how that only happened when the CCP bastards took the boot off of the Chinese people's neck.

Hahaha, Europe is fine. It's just largely developed so it doesn't have huge economic growth. Of course, it could be doing better but the virus (caused again, like SARS, by CCP covering up and inadequate hygiene standards) has severely damaged the world.

And, it sounds from your post that you are a little gleeful about the possibility of western civilization having difficulties.

5671,"&gt;When you said you’d rather have a popularity contest decide your leader than a trained and qualified candidate

Yes? In what way is that illogical?

Governance isn't something that can be done purely through training, as opinions on policy are also of utmost importance. It doesn't matter how well trained you are, if nobody likes the policies you support you shouldn't be in charge.

&gt;Where does that declaration of human rights come from?

It was written and signed by every founding member of the United Nations when the UN was founded.

&gt;Not the ones who leave North Korea. Meanwhile every former Saudi citizen even non Muslims I’ve talked to have had only positive things about the king

Cool, anecdotal evidence. Well, here's my own anecdotes. As somebody who's grown up in Abu Dhabi, a dictatorship ruled by an absolute monarch in the Emir, no, it's bad. My neighbours owned slaves and I knew a few people who were imprisoned without charge, and who if they didn't have citizenship of western countries probably wouldn't have gotten out.

&gt;That isn’t true. Even when Iraq and Syria weren’t war zones they were far worse.

Source?

&gt;The fact is ALL Arab monarchies are better off than secular ones.

Tunisia is a high bar. With the exception of the oil-rich slave states in the gulf, the only Arab monarchy that could really be considered good is Jordan. And argument could be made for Morocco, but the whole ongoing ethnic cleansing in the West Sahara really weakens that claim.

&gt;Let’s say Saudi Arabia becomes a republic tomorrow you think they’d immediately legalize gay marriage?

No?

I don't know what they'd do, because the Al-Saud dynasty is so tied to Saudi as a country that everything would depend on the circumstances of how the monarchy fell.

&gt;That’s like me saying Germany is communist because they have some similarities to Lenin’s thesis

And that would be a valid point, except for the fact that Germany doesn't have any similarities with Lenin's thesis.

&gt;And how many constitutions do you need before it is a failure

I don't believe in a set number; I'm part of the camp that believes a country should change its constitution fairly regularly, (as in every 50 years or so, assuming no special circumstances) in order to adapt to changing circumstances.

&gt;No that isn’t true. 

Yes, it is. In most democracies Parliament is allowed to call an election early at any time.

&gt;And btw no country is a real democracy at best your country is a democratic republic

*It's not a democracy, it's a democratic republic!*

Democracy and republicanism aren't mutually exclusive concepts. A republic is just a non-monarchical government, though in recent years some have tried to redefine it to include representative democracy.

&gt;Just look into any of his recent affairs and actions

Which recent affairs and actions? You need actual sources.

&gt;From the same batch of cronies that we are forced to choose every year. Like why can’t you just vote for whoever or why have campaign ads that cost millions?

Campaign ads don't cost millions in most democracies. That is another example of the Americans being fucking insane. In most countries there is a limit on how much money a campaign can spend.

&gt;Has Ireland had more bad Prime Ministers than good?

That's subjective, but none have caused the country to collapse yet, and the only civil war we've had was immediately after independence, something that happens in most post-colonial states.

&gt;No what I am saying is Juan Carlos giving up the chance to be an absolute monarch in favor of democracy.

So not becoming a dictator and continuing a fascist regime as Franco's successor is ""cowing to the mob""?

&gt;Oh and when his popularity fell he abdicated for his son who is still popular with the people.

https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2019/12/04/spains-royal-family-face-new-calls-for-monarchy-to-go/

The Spanish government has refused to ever call a referendum on the monarchy, so we can't tell that.

Why does that matter to you though? You've been arguing against democracy and popular vote this whole time, so why does popular support for the monarchy matter to you?

&gt;Yes very much so

Please provide proof that every European country copied America.

&gt;Wilson was one of the worst presidents in US history.

And? He was still the US president and he still rejected the idea of Irish independence. Your opinions on him are irrelevant to those facts.

&gt;Plenty of Americana politicians actively funded the rebellion

OK? So did Irish expats in Canada, Australia, Argentina, ect. What makes America special?

&gt;Irish rebellion fashioned themselves after the us revolution

Source? And more importantly, which Irish rebellion? Because [we've had quite a lot of them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Irish_uprisings)

&gt;And is Ireland successful because of its presidency?

No, it's successful because after independence from Britain we were able to pursue our own economic policies without London's interference, and due to support from the European Union, as well as, admittedly, our shitty tax rules.

&gt;Britain is the 7th biggest economy in the world.

Britain has huge amounts of poverty, has been in complete political instability for the last four years, and has some of the poorest regions in northwest Europe. Without London and the southeast of England the UK really isn't that rich.

&gt;Every country went through civil wars including republics.

Yes, but France, the country you used as an example of a successful feudal state, had an extremely high amount of them.

&gt;That isn’t monarchies.

Which one of those do you believe was a fake monarchy?

Everywhere outside of Europe, the very name of a kingdom would change when the dynasty changed, usually.

&gt;The Qing system remained mostly the same as the Ming system for example

Good to see that you're a scholar of Chinese history too. You might have forgotten a few things though, because Ming to Qing is actually one of the worst examples you could have picked.

The Qing moved the capital, completely reformed the military, enforced Manchu cultural aspects on the Han, massively expanded the size of China, and reformed both internal economics and foreign relations. Not a good example for ""mostly the same"".

&gt;Sure they did it was called the Bible

lol

&gt;You realize elective monarchies are a thing right?

Yes, which is still based around familial power, which hereditary monarchs of administrative sub-regions voting for the main monarch.

&gt;How funny you overlooked me mentioning 9 dynasties in 1000 years is certainly better than 5 republics in 200 years

I don't overlook it, I simply proved my point. You said the monarchy lasted 1000 years, and I disproved that, showing the existence of nine different monarchies. I never claimed that the republic lasted uninterrupted for 200 years.

&gt;So if a chimp was elected that would be better than a king

A chimp wouldn't be elected because people won't vote for a chimp to be president. That is actually better than some monarchies, such as Thailand where the current Thai king made his dog the head of the Thai Air Force.

&gt;The royal family donate their private earnings

Private earnings which they get from investments that the state paid for. Their palaces and such should be taken away from them and converted to state museums.

&gt;So again how much money did the president of Ireland bring your country?

None, because that isn't his job.

&gt;So you’re fine with democracy only when it answers to your standards?

Only when it obeys human rights, more specifically, but I suppose yes. I never said I support democracy unequivocally; my loyalty lies with respect for human rights above all.

&gt;So you admit it is living since cells are living.

Cells are living. They are not conscious, have never been conscious, and have no thoughts. They are not a person.

&gt;can you kill someone who is in a coma?

A comatose person is a fully developed human being who has thoughts and who until recently was making conscious decisions. They can feel pain and have opinions and loved ones.

&gt;Forming a union with similar minded parties isn’t compromise.

Who said anything about similarly minded? The current Irish government took weeks of negotiation between parties to form this government.

&gt;Regardless UK has the same system and have done it better than Ireland for the past century

Would disagree on the ""done it better"", but regardless, yes, the UK has the same system. I think they should keep that system, but just get rid of the monarch at the top, who isn't actually involved in the process any more.

&gt;Oh don’t worry there’s still bloodshed.

Source on bloodshed in modern day Irish politics, please?

&gt;give us a binary option

God you're so American.

Not every country only allows you to choose between two parties. That is, once again, a very American problem. Most democracies have ordered voting.

&gt;Why is voting an innately important thing?

Because it's a fundamental human right and because it allows us to choose the government that best represents the people.

&gt;You don’t even think people should decide their leader unless it fits within what you find as an acceptable political ideology.

I don't think people should be able to elect the ideology that invented industrial genocide, no. I think most people would also draw the line there.

&gt;The king has no power and is a figurehead. So tell me why should Spain replace its old white silver spoon billionaire with another old white silver spoon billionaire?

To combat classism and to not spend millions on him each year.

The two feed each other in a vicious circle.

The bulk of the fighting occurred between August and December 1991 when approximately 80,000 Croats were expelled (and some were killed). Many more died and or were displaced in fighting in eastern Slavonia (this territory along the Croatian/Serbian border was not part of the Krajina, and it was the JNA that was the principal actor in that part of the conflict). The total number of exiled Croats and other non-Serbs range from 170,000 (ICTY) up to a quarter of a million people (Human Rights Watch).*

**The Krajina Serbs always had the option of peaceful reintegration. They refused. Comparatively, the Serbs of occupied Eastern Slavonia agreed to peaceful reintegration, not a shot was fired, not a single soul was ""banished.""**

*Talks proposed on 28 July were ignored by the RSK, and last-ditch talks were held in Geneva on 3 August. These quickly broke down as Croatia and the RSK rejected a compromise proposed by Thorvald Stoltenberg, a Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, essentially calling for further negotiations at a later date. In addition, the RSK dismissed a set of Croatian demands, including to disarm, and failed to endorse the Z-4 Plan once again.*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Storm#Prelude

*The Erdut Agreement was an agreement reached on 12 November 1995 between the authorities of the Republic of Croatia and the local Serb authorities of the Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia region on the peaceful resolution to the Croatian War of Independence in eastern Croatia. It initiated process of peaceful reintegration of the region to the central government control (implemented by the United Nations) and provided set of guarantees on minority rights and refugee return.*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdut_Agreement

**The order to evacuate was given by the Krajina Serb leadership**

*At 4:45 p.m., a decision to evacuate the population in the Northern Dalmatia and Lika areas was made by RSK President Milan Martić. According to RSK Major General Milisav Sekulić, Martić ordered the evacuation hoping to coax Milošević and the international community to help the RSK.*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Storm#Sector_South_2

**The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has found that while individual instances of war crime did occur they were not the result of state or military policy**

*The ICTY concluded that Operation Storm was not aimed at ethnic persecution, as civilians had not been deliberately targeted. The Appeals Chamber stated that Croatian Army and Special Police committed crimes after the artillery assault, but the state and military leadership had no role in planning and creation of crimes.*

&gt; Being a part of EU doesn't mean sh*t, look Norway isn't a part of EU, where does Norway stand in the world? 

Norway is part of the EEA, thus it enjoys freedom of movement with the EU. Russia does not.

&gt; Truth is Bulgaria has a per-capita income of around $8000, when Russia has a per-capita income of $12,000, Bulgaria has an HDI of 0.816, while Russia has an HDI of 0.824.

Russian per-capita GDP is inflated by extractive industries such as oil and gas. Sadly, the money doesn't make its way to peoples' pockets, as evident in the average net salaries data.

&gt; Bulgaria has an HDI of 0.816, while Russia has an HDI of 0.824.

And the reason for that minuscule difference is GDP/capita. My original point is that GDP/capita doesn't tell the whole story so I won't be circling back to that again.

5938,"  yes, that usually incites confusion... well and it is difficult to explain as it’s a complicated topic. Terrorism is a police matter cause the tools to prevent and counter it, are tools the police uses and trains and because a military is not trained or equiped for asymmetric warfare, protecting soft targets against civilians for political purposes. While in the beginning it will always be the police at the frontline against terror, not the military.

In case of ISIS, this police intervention was neglected and bad due to postwar insufficiencies as ISIS was founded by highly organized leftovers of Iraqi intelligence and military and they basically really quickly grew into a criminal network before becoming a militia that grew into an army that could take over big parts of several countries while also beeing able governing it. Basically, an occupying force of a territory with a hard frontline. That’s a target for the military, yes. But that can hardly be called terrorist anymore. That was an army of 80k-100k soldiers. They still called them terrorists however because of consistency of messaging to not confuse the public as well as ISIS did not manage to take over the entire government in either of the countries, they were putsching in. Now that they do not control territory anymore, due to military interventions it goes back to being a Police matter. As the military has no frontline to aim for and the ISIS organization goes back to asymmetric warfare with no clear target which one could protect against.

&gt;Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. 

Yes, that’s right. Still doesn´t make my argument entirely wrong. The thing in the Ukraine happened to prevent them to join the EU. So not actually a direct attack on the EU. To understand how I am so confident that no nation is going to attack or invade the EU one must first understand how countries creates their wealth. Nowadays most countries have switched from resource-based economies to skill based economies. Meaning these countries create tax income by educating their citizens to do ever more skilled labor that results in trade. And trade interconnects every country with each other, even the ones producing their money through resources like oil. An attack on a nation therefore is a direct attack on its wealth creation tool as well as against all the countries it trades with it. And the EU has no match in trade. Usually the goal of a country doing that, attacking another country, would be to control the other countries money creation tool. In times of resource based econs, it didn´t matter how many ppl died. But when the money is created directly by the ppl... it does. So everything shy of an entire hardcore land based invasion to control and take over the entire EU territory, where it is the goal to eradicate the EU rather than take it over and control their wealth will never happen. Everything else you might hear in that matter is just political ping pong and to get better negotiation position or change political opinions. And if that invasion really comes, it will probably be foreseen years in advance or its aliens.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/i3gf7p/nearly_half_of_germans_support_withdrawal_of_us/g0ftpso/,v3ritas1989,1596632129
