The article itself however is written so that you'll never see that he was not promoting it, and even agrees it's nonsense. I'm guessing the whole segment was about conspiracy theories

&gt;The Serbian government says the Balkan country is effectively losing a town each year, and that as many as 18 municipalities have fewer than 10,000 people: “We are 103 people less each day.""

101,"I mean, there's a lot of jobs you simply can't do from home..

Carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, mechanics, painters, road workers and other things like that. The craftsman type stuff or whatever you'd call it? You kinda have to be where the client/customer is, you can't build his new house from your home.

Then there's all the production stuff in factories etc. If you're building Volvo trucks you really can't do that from home, you don't get to just bring half a truck into your living room and do it from there. Anything with a ""production line"" obviously needs people there, whether it's building trucks, working in a cookie factory, a farming production, slaughterhouse or whatever.

Then there's retail type stuff where you obviously need to be in the store so people can buy stuff from you. You're not going to sell much if no one's there to open and man the store, the cafe, the restaurant or whatever.

Then you have a lot of the jobs involving working with other people. Teacher, nurse, doctor, police, firefighter, military etc.

You also have various types of scientists etc. who need to either be out in nature (geologists perhaps) or in a lab with a lot of special equipment.


There really aren't that many types of jobs that can be done from home I think. Certain IT jobs and answering phones/telemarketing.. Isn't that pretty much it?

We are a majority based democracy where minority coalitions (like the often happen in other countries, and govern successfully as I should say) are frowned upon which is why the planned minority coalition by Linke, SPD and Grüne in Thüringen was questionable as well, in my opinion. 

I find it a bit strange to say that the ""federal state tolerated the decision"" when the majority of political parties (SPD, Grüne, Linke) in Thüringen immediately protested it and Thüringen's CDU was very much divided on whether to accept the results. Not to mention the protests by the population. The only ones that accepted the results were Thüringen's FDP and AFD. You make it appear as if everyone in Thüringen accepted the decision and only interference by the rest of the country led to other results which is not true, although it probably had an effect - especially in making it clear to Kemmerich that he had to resign. 

I also do not think the chancellor ""interfered"" in the elections. She voiced her opinion on the issue after everyone, including her own party's leader, had already made very clear they disapproved and that the CDU would not be a part of a coalition in Thüringen under Kemmerich.

218,"&gt;Short term violence resulted in long term peace.

No, just you know fragment of history means that anything resulted in each other. I also wouldn't call the Cold War peaceful.


&gt;Germany benefited from the expulsion too, it removed the tensions with its neighbors. Don't fool yourselves that they would disappear or became irrelevant.

So much peace that both Germany were hostile and didn't recognize each other and had diplomatic connection to a country that recognize the other one until Willy Brandt change his policy in West Germany. So less tension that most German political parties saw that the Territories to the east were just under temporary Polish Management for years. So few tension that German rearmament was a controversial topic. That even though Germany wasn't sovereign until 1990.

&gt;The expelled Germans ended up in the rich Germany

What did you smoke? No many ended also up in the GDR and even in West Germany that would mostly end up in poor rural areas and bombed out cities and even after reconstruction they were often in the more poor areas. Especially well seen in the century flood in Hamburg were it killed mostly the refugee living in shabby housing. 

&gt;About 270 thousand of Germans remained in postwar Czechoslovakia, but most moved (legally) into West German during the 1950's - 1960's.

Yes that's true for most German left in the eastern Block, called Spätaussiedler and was a program from West Germany. This has nothing to do with forced expulsion.

227,"So, based on the username and the indicated location I think we can assume that this user is from Poland. As such, I think I can provide some ""cultural insider knowledge"" to explain the seemingly random accusation. Some sizable elements  of the Polish society, especially the ones with more right wing/nationalistic leanings, have an allergic to referring to nazi death camps as, well, *nazi* death camps. As far they're concerned, these were German death camps and calling then anything else constitutes an attempt to absolve the rest of German society from those crimes. It's the same ethos that causes them to fight with all their might against any mention of Polish collaborators. It's not that they believe three were no evil Poles or good Germans, but as far as they're concerned acknowledging them blurs the lines and by doing so ""insults"" the memory of the victims and heroes of the War. 

A little story: I'm pretty sure the only reason my great grandfather survived WWII was because of a German farmer. Great grandfather was being held in some tiny, water filled cell/cage as punishment for trying to escape the POW camp when the farmer took pity on him and taken him in to help with the farm. Said farmer apparently hated nazis (both of his sons got drafted and died), treated great grandfather less like a slave and more like a son (to the point where he offered to make him his heir if great grandfather settled with him) and even arranged for great grandfather's release in 1943-4 (I don't recall exactly).

Moreover, until now, there has been no freedom of association for unions, but Vietnam has adapted its penal code.

Briefly, what happened (which isn't described in the article, of course) is that the AfD put forward their own candidate, but then instead of voting for that candidate, they voted for the CDU candidate.  The socialists thought they would win with a minority of votes because the CDU and AfD were split.  But the AfD's votes put the CDU's candidate over the top.

And minorities as women are not equally represented in all fields of studies. And you still don't understand what systematic racism is, even though I posted numerous citation from research papers on the very same issue.

You do realise men and women choose different fields, so the assumption that unequal representation is based on sexism is just not correct.

The main reason for differences in gender percentages in various fields are due to the choices different genders make, in Norway, one of the most egalitarian countries in the world, researchers have witnessed what they call the gender paradox, where the more egalitarian a society is, the greater the disparity between their career choices becomes. 
Men are more likely to become engineers than women as men are more interested in objects and things, and women generally more interested in people.

The problem is that in the US, this disparity is being sold by people with as being caused by a patriarchy, which is just not true at all, and is not recognised by anyone who studies gender differences sociology or biology professionally.

590,"&gt; Israel has done nothing but taken territory from Palestine

Sure if we ignore the withdrawal from Gaza and the Oslo Accords with the establishment of the three zones in the West Bank.

&gt; UNSC Resolution establishing the two state solution

The first thing Israel did was create itself as per idea of the UN.  
The Arabs attacked and have been attacking ever since.

&gt;  it has illegally built countless settlements on Palestinian soil

So what is Palestinian soil?  
Prior to the establishment of the three zones the Palestinians had zero ""soil"" whatsoever.  
During the times they were ""occupied"" by Jordan and Egypt they also had zero ""soil"".

Land swaps to achieve as much as 99% of the West Banks territory were proposed during Camp David II and through Olmerts peace initiative.  
These plans for peace were fucking great compared to the current one, yet the Palestinians didn't accept them.

&gt; it has built a fricking wall on Palestinian soil to keep the Palestinians out

The security fence who is most often not a wall was build as a direct response to Palestinian terror attacks on: Buses, Cafés, Discotheques, Restaurants, Cinemas and so forth.  
After it was completed the suicide attacks vanished over night.

&gt; it has illegally declared sovereignty over the Golan Heights, even though they still are part of Syrian territory

Syria declared war on Israel in 1948, it has since denied all peace initiatives.  
Why should Israel return the Golan without a peace treaty? So that Syria can use it to shell the Galilee again? Because that's what Syria did prior to 1967 on a regular basis.

&gt; The world doesn't expect Israel to only ""give"", it wants Israel to give back all the things it has illegally taken.

Yes and the Palestinian, Arab opinion is that this includes all of Israel and that the return to the armistice line of 1949 is merely a stepping stone.  
Something tells that's not going to happen.

If the Palestinians want peace they have to negotiate.  
Perpetual war is not going to give them anything.

Prior to the first Intifada Palestinians commuted into Israel every day for work without any checkpoints.  
Then they started killing Israelis and that bit of freedom was taken from them.  
Another Intifada later even more possibilities were taken from them due to even more violence.

607,"Franek Broda, nephew of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, organizes a protest against TVP. - Public Television should be for all citizens, and today it is a propaganda tube of the ruling party - says WP. And invites you to Wrocław on Saturday.

&amp;#x200B;

The demonstrator is organized by the son of Anna Morawiecka, Franek Broda. The protest ""In Defense of Democracy - Against TVP"" will take place on February 15 at 16 on the market in Wroclaw.

&amp;#x200B;

\- TVP as public television should be for all citizens, because every working Pole pays for maintaining this television. Unfortunately, today this station is a propaganda tube of the ruling party and effectively creates an all-year election campaign for them - says WP Franek Broda.

And he adds: - As a young citizen, I said that we had to gather people and show that we do not agree to it.

&amp;#x200B;

\- It's not like I saw some material and decided to organize a protest. It accumulated in me for a long time. When I turned on TVP and once again heard how great PiS is and the opposition is bad, I understood that something had to be done about it - he explains.

&amp;#x200B;

Invites everyone regardless of views

Franek Broda invites everyone to protest, regardless of views. - Even colleagues from PiS. Finally, there are those who, despite supporting this party, cannot look at what TVP is doing - he states.

&amp;#x200B;

The COD, Culture of Equality and Citizens of the Republic of Poland have already invited the protest, and today invitations will be sent to politicians of all groups.

\- There will be speeches and chanting. Banners will also appear - says when asked how the protest will proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

Franek Broda is involved in social and political affairs. He was active in PiS youth, but resigned a few months ago. Last year, **when the Sejm voted for a draft amendment to the penal code providing for penalisation of sex education for further work in the commission**, **he criticized the actions of the ruling party's politicians.**",,/r/europe/comments/f01qlo/prime_ministers_nephew_organizes_a_protest/fgqxox0/,AdministrativePilot3,1581033688

Again, this is true for any measure using fiscal incentives. Like I just said, that makes 95% of policy unacceptable. Let's just not do anything then, right?

Income inequality is a different problem and it's absurd to expect climate measures to solve income inequality first or along the way.

&gt;Alternatives to reduce carbon emissions include but are not limited to electric cars, renewable energy, hydrolysis, tree planting programs, cloud seeding, CO2 vacuums, direct carbon sequestration from burning biomass, etc.

We will need to do all those things already. You'll have to pay for more sequestration then by taxes. 

&gt;Also more related to this topic, labelling meat products with the amount of CO2 they produce and allowing rational customers to make the choice themselves (a novel concept in a democracy, I know).

You already said that above, I already replied [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/eyw1wx/eu_urged_to_adopt_meat_tax_to_tackle_climate/fgnfw2b/) and then you stopped replying and changed the angle because you didn't have an answer.

I just gave you a counterexample of people voluntarily reducing meat usage already. They certainly don't think they're lowering their living standards.

The thing is, we don't have time for voluntary. If we need to use fiscal measures to give a little nudge, so be it.

666,"It depends on how a Jewish person's recent ancestry is defined. If we're going by the country that they or their parents are born in, the percentage of European Jews is roughly [30%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel#Jews). However this excludes those whose paternal country is Israel, which is a bit higher. Another way to define is is by rite. The vast majority of European Jews are Ashkenazi, whereas the vast majority of Middle Eastern Jews are Mizrahi and Sephardic. The majority of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi and Sephardic on the other hand, meaning they're more Middle Eastern than European. 

The whole notion that the majority of Israeli Jews are European or Ashkenazi is an old Anti Israeli talking point from the early days of Israel. It was, and still is, used as a rallying cry by Muslim and Arab leaders to frame the debate. They frame it as Israel is a colony of Europeans who are there to oppress and displace native Arabs, steal their land and plunder their resources. They then frame it as fighting Israel is like fighting the European colonizers who oppressed them for so long, ignoring the fact that Israel isn't as European as they seem. That's not really true, and it kind of distracts from the horrible anti semitism Middle Eastern Jews experienced that led them to flee to Israel (hence why they're the majority even after the European Jewish numbers were bolstered by Soviet Jews). The other issue is that European Jews tended to be more wealthy and powerful than Middle Eastern Jews, and racial discrimination against non European Jews is always lingering. There was even a policy of sterilizing sub Saharan African Jews against their knowledge for awhile as they were having too many kids. Still, regardless, most Jews primary identifier tends to be how religiously devout they are, rather than mere ancestry. 

Which was my point. Israeli Jews of recent (as in, having a Jewish ancestor from a European country in the past few centuries) European Ancestry are less likely to identify as European and more as Middle Eastern or Israeli, simply because Israel has been around for so long. I was saying that if we buy the framing of the argument, that Israeli Jews identify as being of Europe, they still wouldn't account for the majority of Jews in Israel.",,/r/europe/comments/ezvni3/poll_which_country_should_be_allowed_to_join_the/fgr3nho/,DangerousCyclone,1581037403

No it hasn't.  
The only parties of that war which have made peace with Israel are Jordan and Egypt.  
Syria, Iraq and Lebanon are still at war with Israel.  
As is Palestine, otherwise the need for a peace treaty wouldn't exist.

&gt; Of which Palestine wasn't a party by the way

The so called ""Holy War Army"" would like to disagree.

&gt; Also, as I said, there are multiple UNSC Resolutions condemning the illegal Israeli settlements and urging Israel to return the occupied territories and adhere to the two state solution. There has also been and advisory opinion by the ICJ denouncing the Israeli wall as illegal, because it has been built on Palestinian territory. Israel has taken so much from Palestine already and you expect them to give up even more? No, it is on Israel to follow the law and stop their illegal activities.

786,"&gt; Like I said in one of my previous posts there are reports by Austro-Hungarian consul in Skopje Bohumil Para from 1900-1901 which confirm this.

I personally don't believe Albanians and Serbs when it comes to reporting Serbian-Albanian events in an unbiased manner. I'm not saying thise cases didn't happen (some maybe didn't but we can never know for sure and that's not the point), I'm saying the reporting of the events is biased. The bias might even be unintentional, remember this was written over 1 century ago and descriptiona of events got twisted until they reached the right person to get on that list. How do we know an Albanian committed the crime for sure apart from the report made by a Serbian claiming that (especially with some of the cases where Serbs got jailed for the crimes)? I guess I am a bit more clear why I don't fully trust these reports, outsiders can see things differently than participants.

&gt; Are you suggesting that because there was no Albanian state aparatus behind the attrocities they shouldn't be ascribed to Albanians eventhough they perpetrated them?

I'm not suggesting that. I'm saying those are just crimes committed (mainly) for religious reasons in a lawless Balkan and they do not constitute ethnic cleansing and the general Albanian population never had an organized effort to ethnically cleanse Serbians, there were only individual cases of criminals committing crimes. I was previously unaware of those so thanks for showing them to me. 

Anyways, as I see it, we have to agree to disagree here. I want to state I hold no ill feelings towards Serbians for past events, I just want the history to be based on facts, not on propaganda. I know Albanians learn propaganda in school and I'm sure it's the same in Serbia, that's why we have to debate, do our own research and come to our own conclusions.",,/r/europe/comments/eyjkkw/what_do_you_know_about_albania/fgq5bxo/,BetterPhoneRon,1581018153

864,"1) What does the European Commission have to do with this story, which is based on a report from Sandbag and Agora Energiewende?

2) A whopping 24% decrease in electricity production in a single year is amazing however you look at it. But any sane person would realise that you cannot assume anything regarding emissions of the electricity sector based on that, because obviously coal is not the only fossil fuel used to produce electricity, and that number doesn’t say anything about gas generation.

3) A 12% fall in emissions in the electricity sector in a single year is still mind-blowing. It’s extremely good.

4) A 6% fall in total EU GHG emissions in a single year would be amazing. This would be the biggest fall in GHG emissions since 2009, and considering that emissions rebounded in 2010 because most of the fall in 2009 was caused by the recession, I’d say that 2019 would be even better. And it is not caused by a slump in economic activity, since EU GDP increased by 1,4% in 2019. At most it is partly caused by lower GDP growth than expected, but that isn’t a slump in economic activity. Your consideration here is more 1984-esque than this report.

5) The target for 2020 is already reached (-20% compared to 1990, we are at -23,2% without including the incredibly good reduction of 2019). To reach a Paris-compatible target of at least -55% (we’ll see if the European Commission chooses to push for a -55% or a more conservative -50%), we’d need a bit more than a 4%

That is not true.

Also, that shitshow is absolutely idiotic by all of the media and especially the Linke and others.

The best thing they could have done is immedietly try to make a coalition without the AfD.

You have a company (country with democracy), and in this company you have established workers (established parties).

The company lead says ""yeah, you don't like each other, you also don't have to, but still, everybody get their shit together and get the job done"". And the established workers still refuse to work with them. That's the current situation.

This is a dangerous situation for the company. Because it could happen that it will collapse (unlikely, but still) or that company lead agrees and lays off the new workers (possible option). Much more likely, however, is that company lead - being pissed off already - fires the established workers and puts in even more new workers.

1016,"&gt; There is no any single reason for it, there are multiple. There's no easy answer of ""well duh, they were just homophobes""  
  
So what are those reasons?  
  
&gt; They're part of the culture they're not allowed of being a part of ? No.  
  
A Polish (example) person is still culturally Polish, even if they're gay.  
  
&gt; Sure they do. On the territory of Finland. Christians do as a whole.   
  
No they don't. That's not a thing.  
  
&gt; I will say that your premise is false though, and show it how. For example a religious person might not have anything against marriage between black and white people in your hypothetical country, but can fully be against gay marriage since his religion says that's wrong, while it has nothing against black/white. It's intellectually fully consistent, he follows a set of ideas, in which one is good, the other not.  
  
Easy amendment: the white people followed a racist ideology. That's consistent now.  
  
&gt; Results have to be accepted both ways which is something that LGBT movement doesn't want to accept. It can't ever be ""they have a right to do so"" it's always ""they're homophobes, they have to change, this is human rights violation"", ""we're being deleted"" and so on and so on.  
  
I don't see why anyone should accept anything that they think undermines their rights. If homophobes have the right to voice their homophobia then LGBT people have the right to voice their disapproval of homophobia. What you are suggesting is that status quo should never be challenged, which is ridiculous. Do you also think that black people in the US should have accepted that slavery is part of the culture and they shouldn't fight for a change?  
  
&gt; As I said before my issues are mainly with the toxic ideology and proselytization that comes from the movement, not with actual people itself.  
   
I don't get this line of thinking. If LGBT people think they're missing rights, how else should they try to get their rights if not by ""proselytising"" as you put it?",MA -> FI,/r/europe/comments/ez9i8q/polish_lgbtifree_zones_not_ok_says_eu_commission/fgpfxhj/,Lyress,1581004016

This is false. Only hardcore nationalists dream of this, but neither the Kosovo government nor the Albanian one want this.

&gt; - It was one of the main supporters of the KLA during the Kosovo war.

Not only supporting, there were training camps in Albania where Albanian Army Generals trained KLA fighters (I assume with US help, but I have no sources), there was a command center in Tirana for the KLA, later turned into a hospital for wounded soldiers etc. 

&gt; - The village of Lazarat in southern Albania grew its own weed and sold it for years. The Albanian police raided Lazarat back in 2014 and the villagers defended their village by using bazookas, machine guns and grenades.

There was recently a report that weed production in Albania rose by something like 1800% in 2019 so the Lazarat raid was just an attempt from the government to 'save face' after some tourists made a documentary about it.",,/r/europe/comments/eyjkkw/what_do_you_know_about_albania/fgpglnu/,BetterPhoneRon,1581004393

If you want a decent economics education go to minor universities where evidence and logic matter more than who agrees with you.

Incremental inflation has been proven to not work latest since the 70s, yet central banks still follow it. Why? Because they have a huge incentive to keep believing in that. If the view that free markets are superior at allocating resources than a central body is accepted then the central banks would have to be abolished.

Additionally, politicians love trying to game the business cycle to get the good years in their terms and the resulting recessions under their rival's terms. See what Trump is doing right now, he's talking about how good the economy is but that's all artificial. He is going to make the world economy go to shit.

No justification necessary. 

&gt;That's hardly an excuse.

&gt;Can't think of any reason that is not homophobic one way or the other.



It's not an excuse though. If the population doesn't want it, it doesn't want it. 

Why should you be able to force them to accept something they don't ?

How does it not work the other way too, are they allowed to force you to accept something you don't ?

&gt;But there isn't anything inherently negative about gay marriage. You don't see people being outraged that criminals or evil people can get married, but with the gays it's suddenly a problem?

Yes. As I said it's up to the people to decide that. 

&gt;The only reason gay people didn't have marriage for the last 2000 years is because society at large was homophobic. There's 0 reason to perpetuate that inequality.

It's really not.  It has nothing to do with gay people, marriage was an economical decision throughout history. It was to promote family, which homosexuals couldn't have. It was so your landlord could keep getting taxes from you and have you do the work and your future family. It was passing down knowledge and expertise down the family lines. Gay couples simply couldn't perform most of these functions and as such they were not allowed to gain the benefits of marriage.  It was ensuring the success and continuation of the species. Go back further than 2000 years it's the same thing. In Ancient greece you could have freely fondled little boys, but you couldn't marry guys, you couldn't start a family with them.

&gt;It's not okay that they're against it to begin with. 

So ? Should the entire world bend to your wishes ? Be not okay with it as you like.

&gt;Do you also think that it wasn't okay for northern American states to force the southern ones to give up slavery?

Remind me, what did that result it ? One of the bloodiest civil wars. Is that what you're after here, a civil war between heterosexual and homosexual population ? Between followers of LGBT ideology and enemies ?

Plenty of other nations got rid of slavery too which didn't require such violent methods, both before and after the US. Mostly because there was no forcing involved.

&gt;They already do. Gay people have as much claim to the marriage tradition as straight people.

That's just not true. It's the equivalent of a christian saying they have just as much claim to hannukah as the jewish people.  They don't.",🇮🇱 Израел 🇮🇱,/r/europe/comments/ez9i8q/polish_lgbtifree_zones_not_ok_says_eu_commission/fgp4sqc/,ahwhatever11,1580996844

1182,"Double impacts of race and gender. The unique experiences of women of color have been
largely ignored by the health care system. These women share many of the problems
experienced by minority groups, in general, and women, as a whole. However, race dis-
crimination and sex discrimination intersect to magnify the barriers minority women
face in gaining equal access to quality health care.36 This intersection or “double
impact” affects women of color with regard to provision of treatments, access to medical
care and inclusion in research. This is partly the result of different expectations of med-
ical care between men and women and of gender bias among health care providers.
Furthermore, these barriers are exacerbated in the case of gender-specific illnesses such
as breast cancer.37
105. Policies and practices that increase government surveillance and control of minority
women are also a key factor in health status. Minority women are less likely to receive
sympathetic intervention by law enforcement in the case of domestic violence. There are
numerous cases of women who, after calling upon police for help in such cases, are vic-
tims of both domestic violence and police violence. Family planning is another area
where public policy has had a negative impact on health status and life choices of minor-
ity women. Minority women do not have equal access to preventive medicine or the full
range of birth control available. Barriers include lack of family planning services or facil-
ities in their communities; lack of coverage of certain services, medications or procedures
by Medicaid or other publicly funded health insurance programs; and disproportionate-
ly higher prescription of medically risky or unnecessary procedures such as contraceptive
implants or forced sterilization. State and local policies are more likely to be discrimi-
natory than federal policies. However, there are few standards for ensuring equal access
and equal treatment at this level of government. With jurisdiction over this area
increasingly devolving to the state and local level, there is a critical need for a clear reg-
ulatory infrastructure that provides redress for these barriers and remedies and conse-
quences for policies and practices with discriminatory outcomes.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/eyaksx/finlands_prime_minister_said_nordic_countries_do/fgow57p/,tdzida26,1580989293

1198,"German person here. I very much agree with the public outrage. For two reasons:

1. While the left didn't get the absolute majority of the popular vote, they certainly got the relative majority. This should be respected by everyone. CDU/FDP could have refrained from voting in the third round (""enthalten"") to not get in this situation. Instead, now the FDP - the smallest party - leads the government. How do you explain this to the voter? This is bad for democracy as a whole. All the more as CDU&amp;FDP used a hard anti AfD-rhetoric in the time leading up to the election.

2. The CDU had strong sentiments (Unvereinbarkeitsbeschluss) against the left and AfD, fair enough. As push came to shove, it turned out that they'd rather throw the border to the right overboard. And it isn't just any right wing party - Thuringia's AfD faction is the most extremist and openly fascist of all AfD factions. Which tells me: These guys - CDU/FDP are just purely hungry for power, they don't care about the cost.

It was shown in the parliament only shortly afterwards how this will play out in practice: There was a bit of turmoil in the building, so FDP and CDU voted to postpone the rest of the session. The request only passed with the help of the AfD. It is straight-out naive to assume that this government will achieve anything without the AfD's support. And this party, I cannot say it enough, is fascist.

1201,"Access to higher education is critical to moving out of poverty. According to the US
Census Bureau, earnings for college graduates average more than 50% higher than earn-
ings for high school graduates. The disparity is more marked between those who stop
at high school and those who complete some graduate school. Indeed, earning a gradu-
ate degree is an important factor in earning power. Post-secondary education is espe-
cially important for racial minorities who are about twice more likely than whites to be
stuck in poverty if they can not earn a college degree. 
 Therefore, bias and discrimination in higher education form a critical barrier to living
wage and high wage jobs, which in turn affects virtually every facet of quality of life.
This bias takes many forms. It begins in secondary education where minorities are
denied access to courses that are required for college admission or that will better pre-
pare them for success in post secondary education. For example, a study by the UCLA
Graduate School of Education has found that minority students are systematically
excluded from Advanced Placement classes. A study on race and education by the
Applied Research Center, No Exit? Testing, Tracking, and Students of Color in US Public
Schools, (Appendix E) found that tracking is most common in schools with “significant
numbers of African American and/or Latino students.” Further, white students regard-
less of test scores, grades or behavior were much more likely to be placed in “higher
tracks” or academic programs. Students of color - especially African Americans and
Latinos - were more likely to be placed in “lower” tracks. 
The result of these programs, besides creating inequality within a local district or even
within a single school, is that racial minorities are less likely to receive adequate prepa-
ration for college regardless of academic ability. The segregation of housing, resources
and wealth by race has led to a system where young people’s life options can be severely
limited or greatly enhanced by a single factor: where they reside.
 Those people of color who are able to access college preparatory classes find yet another
barrier to college: standardized testing designed to privilege whites. The studies show-
ing racial bias in standardized admission tests are numerous. However, one study by the
Princeton Review (Rosner, 1999) found particularly damning evidence. The Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT), the test most often used by colleges to determine undergraduate
college admission for students entering from high school, disallowed any questions on
which African Americans consistently scored better than whites on the test as part of its
criteria for test validity. Questions on which whites scored better than African Americans
were kept on the test (see Appendix F).",Earth,/r/europe/comments/eyaksx/finlands_prime_minister_said_nordic_countries_do/fgowdib/,tdzida26,1580989566

1216,"Welfare policy has been used as a political vehicle to exploit and control large numbers
of women, poor people and people of color in the US. These laws are based on racist and
sexist assumptions about the roles of women and people of color in the US economy and
society. Consistent with similar “structural adjustment” policies throughout the world,
welfare policy in the US reduces government responsibility for community needs in the
name of bolstering the free market. Specifically, welfare reform laws have transformed
political, social and economic relations in the US by:
Increasing the economic exploitation of women (and some men) and reducing
their choices within the labor market.
By tying aid to strict work requirements, the laws trap people in the lowest wage and
benefit sectors of the economy, typically with little opportunity for advancement, job
protection, or unionization. Formidable barriers to enrolling in public benefit programs
such as long and confusing applications discourage people from applying for assistance. 
Expanding patriarchy by setting more rigid gender roles, denying women economic
and social opportunity, and controlling reproductive decisions by women.
Welfare reform laws increase the control by men over the lives of women in the work-
place, in policy-making arenas and in the household. By capping aid levels regardless of
family size and by failing to provide public benefits for caregiving work, welfare reform
laws use a parent’s decision to have children as leverage to force them into the wage labor
market. Some states even take children from their parents as punishment for straying
from welfare regulations. These policies are primarily targeted to poor women of color
as the prevalence of certain policies like family caps and the availability of certain forms
of long term birth control and even “abstinence only” sex education are targeted to com-
munities where people of color are the majority. Recent initiatives that focus on father-
hood and sanctions for families without fathers (referred to as “marriage” policies) are
also disproportionately targeted to women of color and represent some of the more
extreme forms of control.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/eyaksx/finlands_prime_minister_said_nordic_countries_do/fgowmyk/,tdzida26,1580989873

1278,"To elaborate on this extremely poorly chosen title:

The Dutch government had an electronic system called SyRI (*Systeem Risico Indicatie*, ""System Risk Indication"") that was meant to aid in detecting civilians who committed fraud. The system worked by linking different governmental databases together and trying to find patterns which could point towards fraudsters.

However, it turned out that the system was quite prone to bias, insufficiently transparent to how it operated and the law which enabled its use did not allow for decent checks and balances. This has made the system's use (especially its lack of care for privacy) controversial to say the least.

None of this was to ""spy on the poor"", it was an attempt to detect and flag fraudsters early on. The system itself has not been forbidden, just the way it is used right now - which infringes on privacy too often and too much.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/ezmsan/landmark_ruling_by_dutch_court_stops_government/fgoqu4x/,ojima,1580982092

\- Italians are some of the oldest Europeans, and while they often accumulate wealth by old age, new economic gains after retirement are limited.

\- Italy has the lowest educational profile of the EU-15, fueled by a high rate of early school leavers and the least educated immigrants in the EU (55% have at most middle school education). This limits maximum incomes for a huge swath of the population.

\- Youth unemployment is toxic in many more ways than simply delaying employment. People who have not started building a career by age 30 will struggle to have one, and be often overlooked in favour of younger applicants. Being unemployed in your 20s triggers a lifelong disadvantage for many people.

1343,"&gt;I mean, that is a valid story of course, but in my generation, I lteraly don't know a single family where the wife would be a housewife. When I was a kid, the classic family size were two kids, the mother would typically stay at home only when the kids were too young to go to a kindergarten/nursery and then they would go back to their full time job. This was and continues to be the standard in my country. We all grew up like that. Are you saying that somehow we are all damaged because our parents did not give us enough attention? I certainly don't feel that way.


well it depends on many factors like type of job(stable working hours or not). saw statistic showing that more then 50% of kids from such families return to empty home after school.
Saw also polls showing that majority of parents of such familiies feeling lack they dont have enough to do everything they want, like spending enough time with their kids.

&gt;I mean, it's your choice if you want to stay with your kids at home or if you want to find a partner willing to do that, from my perspective, the idea of staying home and not going to work for the whole period when your kids are at home is extremely boring, I would literaly rather not have kids at all if I were forced to do that.

Of course different people value different things, but you also contradict yourself a bit, earlier you said  its not that hard to be stay at home mom but you yourself wouldnt want to make such choice, of course there is nothing wrong with that but maybe its not that easy thing to do as you seem to believe, I saw stay at home moms  having at as hard if not harder then many of jobs out there, so yeah I do believe stay at home moms who give proper upbringing to their kids do deserve respect that society doesnt give them.

&gt;A lot of was said here how people actually work in boring jobs, how it would in fact be so much more enjoyable to stay at home, but in reality, even if your job is not super interesting, it's still a way to socialize, to meet new people, to be in touch with adults and talk about non-baby stuff, to have some sort of variety in your life, to not be clossed of socially just in your family circle.

while you do make a good point I think its mostly problem for few first years same as when you actually have to give job temporarily job to rise kid, I know stay at home moms who were as good  if not better at socializing with their friends then  people who have jobs.
its not all doom and gloom where they have to give up everything.

&gt;If you think that sitting at home all the time or chatting only with other mums at a playground is so much fun, why don't you become a stay at home dad? Nothing prevents you from doing that. But hey, I don't see a lot of men hurrying to give up their careers and life outside the family. Maybe because it's not exactly the most thrilling lifestyle ever.

If the car emits more Co2 before it even touched the street as a Diesel car would in a 7 year lifetime, electric cars are a wash. They are feel good cars, but don't provide a solution to climate change.

&gt; but how are construction workers, delivery drivers, etc going to move themselves and their goods/tools around?

This is not individual driving. Individual driving is the family farther that drives every morning 50km to work and every evening 50 km back. It's the mother that takes her children to school with the car because it's faster and easier to catch the buss. It's the young guy that meets his friends by car because it's 20 minutes faster instead of taking the buss/tram. It's the dude that doesn't want walk the 100 meters to the next cigarette automate and takes the car...

Well and it's also all the regions or places that don't have a working public transport system.

&gt; You are approaching climate change the wrong way. You don’t need to make things more expensive to grind down peoples living standards. You need to make investments (Like the European Green New Deal) that are productive AND reduce emissions.

The sad truth is that we are past that point if we want to stop our climate change. Stuff like that would have worked 30 years ago where we had less privileges (for example not 3 cars as a familie instead only 1). But the climate change has become much worse since then and we have so many privileges right now that are only possible because we completely shit on nature and the people they produce them.

Those things are not sustainable.

&gt; Climate change will be solved through innovation and investments in things like electric cars, renewable energy, more plant based food options, tree-planting (trillion tree initiative) carbon capture and storage where possible... etc.

Yeah that would be pretty great. But this alone is not enough. We need to stop wasting resources for example and therefore we need rules that prevents that. Innovation in the right thing is only 1 step. People 30 years ago thought the same.

btw electric cars (or at least the current) are a wash. They change the co2 emissin from driving into the production. Nothing is won there.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/eyw1wx/eu_urged_to_adopt_meat_tax_to_tackle_climate/fgolt0l/,Are_y0u,1580975084

1399,"&gt; Crazy thing,any acussation by a woman should be inmediatelly accepted as the truth

Especially when there's damning evidence such as videos, the fact that they dragged her away from the street and stole her phone so she couldn't call for help or report the rape, and the fact that they had an entire group chat dedicated to their rape escapades where they found a video of them groping another an unconscious woman in a van. But hey, you do you.

&gt;proving that there was violence or intimidation involved before condemning someone for a crime that by definition requires violence or intimidation is an outdated an backwards concept.

Rape is literally defined as any penetrative sex without the consent of the victim. Having a requirement for force discourages victims from even reporting the crime because they know their cases will just get shut down like in La Manada. Forcing people to jump over arbitrary hurdles after going through a traumatic experience is inhumane, especially when it increases the likelihood of the perpetrators getting away with their crime.

&gt;There was a video in which a woman participates in group sex,she appeared as a willing participant,at no point she was threatened or forced to comply with violence

Yeah, raping a drunk woman and stealing her phone to prevent her from calling for help is toootally 100% consensual. 

&gt;then judges bulged to societal pressure and didn't do their fucking job.

Justice is determined by the public, not judges. Everyone and their cat knows that Spain's rape laws are stuck behind a few centuries, there's nothing wrong with changing it to be more just.

1579,"&gt; So if CDU and Liberals wouldn't have voted for that left government, but AfD did. Would that be a problem also and should the left parties then have voted for a CDU or Liberal candidate?

That would essentially be the same problem, yeah. Though RRG is much closer to a majority than CDU/FDP. RRG is 4 seats short of a majority, CDU/FDP is 20 seats short of a majority.

The problem is actually that Germany's political landscape is very stiff and partisan. Parlamentarians are expected to vote with their party almost always. So even if RRG only lacks 4 seats it's hard to see where they would get that from without some sort of agreement - which they would not have if it's the AfD that pushes them over the line. A liberal partycould theoretically be a good supporting party for a left-wing alliance like Radikale Venstre in Denmark but the FDP hasn't been social liberal since the early 80's and is probably more right-wing than the CDU overall even.

You are making the overly simplified and incorrect assumption that racial inequality is the same as racial discrimination.

There are many complex reasons for unequal racial representation in various fields and in parliament than simply 'systemic racism'

Ethnic and racial groups choose to study and pursue different field and career paths than others, just as, in general terms, all of us are influenced culturally, historically, religiously and ethnically, these factors influence many of our decisions, including career choices.

Your view of equity is extremely simplified, and actually quite damaging in that it proposes equality of outcome, which is no good for anyone.

&gt;  
&gt;**Location:**  Spain  
&gt;  
&gt;**Event:**  The Spanish Ministry of Interior reports a steady increase in the number of sexual assaults nationally over the past five years.  This includes a rise in sexual assault against young U.S. citizen visitors and students throughout Spain.  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault in Spain can find it very difficult to navigate the local criminal justice system, which differs significantly from the U.S. system.  The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General urge U.S. citizen students and visitors to take precautions against sexual assault during their stay in Spain.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Actions to Take:**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Drink responsibly.  Do not consume beverages that have been out of your control.  
&gt;  
&gt;Use the buddy system, and travel with a friend or a family member.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have been sexually assaulted, call 112 immediately.  Also, consider contacting a local attorney to help you navigate the criminal justice process and protect your rights.  The Embassy and Consulate General maintain a [list of English-speaking attorneys](https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fes.usembassy.gov%2Fu-s-citizen-services%2Fattorneys%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CRhatiganJV%40state.gov%7C04ef7cc3578b4da111fa08d7a8e87cf9%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C1%7C637163588802615069&amp;sdata=np8CXjXj%2BccQrnXb5HjKlJWaRnOMT9vYphZYlOC5m%2Fk%3D&amp;reserved=0).  For more information on what to expect, please visit our [website](https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fes.usembassy.gov%2Fu-s-citizen-services%2Fvictims-of-crime%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CRhatiganJV%40state.gov%7C04ef7cc3578b4da111fa08d7a8e87cf9%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C1%7C637163588802625067&amp;sdata=0JPcVLqgELMgbWAF5FmB7aZaF2aGkAQkAw6J65TIAtw%3D&amp;reserved=0).

1653,"i doubt you're being sincere here. LGBT has become an entire ideological institution that is excused because they're associated with a ""persecuted minority"". when we get total equality one day (whatever that may be), do you think all the institutions and activists they have will just deactivate and go home? no, institutions of any kind have to justify their existence to stay alive since such is the nature of institutions, they will not stop inventing new reasons to keep the whole ideological facade of escaping oppression and winning rights alive years into the future. the entire LGBT thing has a very real ideological dogma involving oppression, what's normative and thus bad, collective guilt, completely abstract human rights the definition of which is broadened every day, etc. i don't get how people don't see a power dynamic. 

blonde people don't have NGOs and advocacy groups which have the ear of the government. blonde people don't have blonde month approved by international megacorporations (which are rapidly nearing the point where national governments will be rendered powerless btw). blonde people don't have blonde parades where they taunt all the brunettes for being so normal. blonde people aren't tacitly supporting the more out-there gingers and dyed hair people. you aren't seen as an evil villain for calling blondes stupid.

there are homosexuals who aren't out on a power trip where they get to see the entire mainstream bend to their complaints and whims. they dress like the average man, have normal speech mannerisms, and don't build their identity around sexual orientation. these people are different from a comprehensive network of institutions that see the LGBT idea as a sort of crypto-religion. this is a small minority however, since it's a societal expectation that if you are gay, you must necessarily also support or feel sympathy towards everything that's stereotypical of ""an LGBT person"", so there's a constant push to conform to society's idea of what a ""queer"" person is supposed to be like (piercings, ""fabulousness"", edgy hair, supporting the right causes, imitating a simplistic caricature of a teenage girl, concept of linear progress, etc.)

ultimately the LGBT phenomenon will one day end up hurting all homosexuals, because there will be a point where the ideological hegemony of tolerance is vehemently hated by a significant percentage, and that percentage will take all their resentment out on all homosexuals due to every single one of them being seen as collectively guilty, just as white european men today are seen as being collectively guilty for colonialism, witch burnings, patriarchy, and the funny austrian guy.

1682,"&gt; Female circumcision is extremely prevalent in SE-Asia (e.g. Indonesia and Malaysia) and NE-Africa (e.g. Egypt, Somalia) where this type of Islam is practiced.

It's also prevalent amongst the neighboring Christians in the same regions as well. Very odd.. 

&gt;Your example is a loaded question. My question wasn't loaded, so it's nto a ""bad faith nonsense question"". And the comparison isn't some ""MRA nonsense"". I already refuted the link and you even admit that it's comparable later on in your comment.

Your example was just as loaded. 

&gt;Which makes it comparable to female circumcision, i.e.** those types that do similar damage.


Which is never what anyone is actually talking about. Because if we were talking about FGM that doesn't do any damage then no one would actually know about it. FGM is such a widespread problem because of the health risks associated with the extreme versions. 

&gt;But male circumcision and the ""minor"" forms of female circumcision are also comparable to the ""major"" forms of female circumcision if you're not thinking of the extent of the damage done. I.e. they are both cosmetic genital surgery done to children.

FGM is only a problem because of the damage done to children. Not for any other reason that you may find icky or foreign. If it had the same health outcomes as male circumcision no one would care.

&gt;So are you against the ban on the forms of female circumcision that are comparable to male circumcision?

Are there forms that are comparable to circumcision? Isn't that the whole point of everything I've said. That they aren't comparable.. In a theoretical world where they were (and that is not this world) then yes I wouldn't care. Unfortunately that's not what happens with FGM. 

&gt;The overwhelming majority of the population, doctors, nurses and children's rights advocates want the ban. The idea that this is some ""white nationalist"" idea is absurd.

Not at all. Go and read what Jews and Muslims think about these 'Intactivist' movements to ban circumcision.

It was always easier to extradite him from the UK. Extraditions from the UK are fairly routine.

* **Gobdaw** - a vacuous fool. Gob being slang for mouth, dawwwww being the sound coming from it. Can be used in banter, but stings a bit.  

* **Bollocks** - broad insult, and slang for testicles. Can be used in banter, or even as a friendly greeting.

* **Fecker** - light-hearted rebuke, sterilised version of 'fucker'. Safe to use in unfamiliar company. Worthless in banter. 

* **Gobshite** - slightly bitter insult, a stern rebuke. Can be used in banter when delivered with laughter. 

* **Gowl** - rough slang for vagina, or can also be used as a descriptor for someone (typically a woman, but can be a man) who is depressingly annoying. Not used in banter.

* **Eejit** - sanitised version of idiot. Can be used by anyone from any station in life in any situation. Friendlier than 'idiot' and implies no insult intended or given. Worthless in banter.  

* **Hoor** - not to be confused with 'whore', typically prefaced with a further discriptor: e.g. a 'dirty hoor'. Implies disrepute, roughness, devilment, roguishness, etc. depending on the prefix used. Not used in banter. 

* **Hussy** - a woman of scandalous ways. Can be used in banter. 

* **Pup / Scut** - labels for children (or those much younger than you) who are being out of order, naughty, or mischievous. Not used in banter.

* **Wagon** - A woman who is over-bearing and unpleasant. The ball-and-chain. Unusual in direct banter. 

* **Dope / Tool / Cabbage / Donkey / Muppet** - variations on the common-garden fool. Can all be used in banter or just general conversation. 

* **Thick** - someone who is a fool can also be called 'thick', but, in parts of Ireland, can also be labelled 'a thick', as opposed to just being (temporarily) thick. Can be used in banter. Foreigners should abandon any use of the term 'thicc', just in case.  

* **Looder / Langer** - Less widespread variations on calling someone a bit of a twit. Connotations of *hoor*, but not severe. Can be used in banter.  

* **Flute / Spanner** - more severe variation on fool, implies behaviour is typical. Can be used in banter.  

* **Amadán** - Irish-language version of fool. Used in polite company, no severity, a bit classy. Worthless in banter.  

* **Head-the-ball** - someone who has perhaps taken too many blows to the head and is now likely to start altercations or some craziness. Can be used in banter. 

* **Dryshite** - this person is no fun, does not appreciate humour or devilment.

Sorry, no. Baudet is young enough that he'll likely live through some serious consequences as a result of Climate Change. Actively undermining our collective understanding of and response to an existential crisis for the sake of power is *stupid* when said crisis will affect you the same as it will everyone else.

&gt;  Or simply having the wrong world view that blocks reason.

Which... makes him *stupid*. Are we really going to pretend otherwise?

&gt; but you and I could both be massively stupid about something or other.

We almost certainly are. But unlike people like Baudet, I; and I hope yourself as well; am not *willfully* stupid.

&gt; For example, I suspect Trump to be absolutely socially inept, but also... what's the word? Devious, I guess? These are people who know how to play games, is what I'm saying.

Oh please. He's neither devious nor capable of playing games at a high enough level to be considered competent. What he *is*, is a *narcissistic sociopath*. People like that don't formulate devious plans or play the games of high level politics. Pay any amount of attention to *anything* Trump does in life, and you quickly come to the realization that *everything* is about his ego. Seriously, if you don't recognize by now that he's laughable incompetent at everything he does, then you haven't been paying much attention. If he was devious and a game player, he wouldn't have managed to do things like bankrupt 3 casinos, and try play real-estate powerplayer so badly that you end up with less money than you would have if you'd just put that massive loan daddy gave you into the stockmarket and forgot about it.

1781,"&gt; I’ll have to agree to disagree with this one. I don’t subscribe to the mentality that we should financially penalize people until they stop doing something like eating meat (or less of it). This isn’t smoking or drugs, it’s food.

Meat is a luxury food item, much like alcohol or candy.

&gt;A food tax will only affect the poorest segments of society anyway

It's not a food tax, it's a meat tax. Easily avoidable.

&gt;and how would you feel if you’re poor and now have to change your eating habits while those with more money can just swallow the cost? Not fair at all.

How would you feel if you're poor and now it's often 35° C in summer, and you can't afford airco?

&gt;And I’m not for doing nothing about climate change, there’s a million and one productive investments we can and are making that will have more effect than this without forcing people to stop eating meat.

If you declare meat off limits, you'll have to provide carbon sequestration good for 15% of current emissions on top of everything else. That costs money. That will come from taxes. Which will be levied on everything, not just meat.  At least with a meat tax there's the option to avoid them. 

Or perhaps we can just add the cost of the carbon sequestration to the price of meat? Oh wait, that's exactly what this proposal is.

They do, and you could have learned that within minutes. But that would require actual honest interest on your part.

&gt; Who has the power to say anything more than ""we don't like LGBTQ free zones?"" but enforce anything to the contrary?

That depends on what these ""zones"" actually violate. In general, if local remedies are exhausted, a claim at the ECHR or CJEU is possible. But since Poland has some exemptions from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, it can't be sued for its breach. Other than that, claimants would have to rely on other treaties via the CJEU, as it may be covered by other instruments that tackle discrimination such as the European Social Charter. From skimming it as a layman, additionally the ""non-discrimination"" part of the TFEU also may come into play which gives the Council the ability to act, although I am not sure if that applies only to work-place discrimination.

2035,"A HUGE fuss is being made over the “betrayal” of Britain’s fishing industry with foreign boats allowed to continue harvesting our waters for 21 months after we leave the EU.

By PETER HILL

PUBLISHED: 10:15, Tue, Mar 27, 2018UPDATED: 10:47, Tue, Mar 27, 2018

But it turns out that foreign firms already own a big slice of British fishing rights and will continue to do so permanently. 

Why? 

Because British companies sold their quotas. Spanish firms own 88 per cent of Welsh fishing rights and most of the quota from the Bristol Channel to the Scottish border.

Dutch and Icelandic firms control most of our East Coast fishing. European seas are split into sectors and governments hand out quotas specifying how much of each type of fish can be caught. Unlike in other countries the Environment Department allows any or all of its quotas to be sold to foreign trawler firms.

“England and Wales have mismanaged their fishing quota and Brexit will do nothing to put it right,” says law lecturer Tom Appleby. ",,/r/europe/comments/evkjn6/eu_vessels_will_no_longer_have_automatic_access/fgmugue/,iamnotinterested2,1580932292

2139,"I am going by the original comment by a Latvian who says that the shop resells legit Ikea stuff. If the shop sells counterfeit stuff, that's a completely different situation and the seller obviously breaks the law.

I have seen this in many places in Europe - like you have a sports shop that sells Nike, Adidas, Under Armour... and they have all their logos right on display, despite not being owned by them, not owning the logos - being just a reseller. Or a shop that sells smartphones and prepaid cards from carriers and they have logos of smartphone companies and carriers on the shop. That's also only a reseller and has these logos there he doesn't own, just sells their products. Or there are tobacco shops that have e.g. Marlboro or Camel logo on them, despite not being owned nor operated by Marlboro or Camel, just simply selling their products.

Of course, every one of these shops has a name of the company operating it on it, and also on the receipts.

I have seen this everywhere in Europe, so I think it can not be illegal as it is so widespread and on display for everyone to see, and no one seems to be doing anything about it. I think it is because it is beneficial for that manufacturer whose logo is used - if that reseller with Samsung logo in his window sells a Samsung smartphone, Samsung gets money. If this Ikea reseller sells some Ikea furniture, Ikea gets money. Why would they have a problem with it?

Of course I am talking only about resellers selling legit stuff. Counterfeits is whole other thing and obviously everything about it from beginning to end is illegal.",,/r/europe/comments/ez9s2f/just_an_ikea_in_latvia/fgmi30h/,mintberrycthulhu,1580925002

2143,"found in the German newspaper [Die ZEIT](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2020-01/populismus-anti-migrationsparteien-eu-studie-wahlergebnisse)

&gt;Where Europe votes against immigration  
&gt;  
&gt;For the first time, a study has analysed election results from 80,000 regions. It shows that a high proportion of migrants rarely leads to rejection of immigration.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When do people tend to reject immigration and what fosters Euroscepticism? A new [study by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC118855) (JRC) has examined these questions using data.  
&gt;  
&gt;JRC researchers first analysed Eurobarometer surveys between 2011 and 2019, which show that people with a negative attitude towards immigration also tend to be more Eurosceptic. Prior to the so-called refugee crisis in 2015, respondents tended to base their concerns about immigration on economic considerations, while thereafter, depending on the member state, they tended to associate it with either economic or security concerns (such as terrorism). The analysis also showed that people who are better educated, students and young people, as well as those in employment, are more likely to trust the EU.  
&gt;  
&gt;These Eurobarometer survey results help to analyse the attitudes of Europeans. But who did the people on the ground vote for in the European elections? So far, there has been a lack of a coherent set of data summarising local election results from all European regions. ZEIT ONLINE succeeded in doing so this summer in cooperation with the French data analyst Arnold Platon. The [new data set](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2019-07/europawahl-gemeinden-eu-mitgliedsstaaten-ergebnisse-analyse) shows how more than 200 million voters in around 80,000 regions voted. ZEIT ONLINE made this data available to JRC researchers, who were able to use these regional voting patterns of the European elections for their analyses. The main basis for the political classification of the parties is the assessment of the [Chapel Hill Expert Survey](https://www.chesdata.eu/). The international network of researchers regularly categorises all relevant parties in Europe. For example, it also examines and defines whether a party is Eurosceptic and what migration policy it stands for.  
&gt;  
&gt;The analysis of the election data confirms that areas with high percentages of votes for parties calling for restrictive measures against migration are more likely to be associated with economic and socio-demographic factors such as population ageing, low levels of education and low income than with the presence of immigrants. In most Member States, people living in sparsely populated regions are more inclined to vote in favour of anti-immigrant parties.  
&gt;  
&gt;A striking example of this clear divide between urban and rural areas is France. In the large cities of Paris, Lyon, Montpellier, Toulouse and Lille, the liberal party La République en Marche of President Emmanuel Macron is usually the strongest force. The situation is different in the provinces. Here the right-wing Rassemblement National dominates. In Austria and Sweden, too, this gap in voting behaviour is particularly marked.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A comparison of the EU election data for the years 2014 and 2019 also shows that parties critical of immigration were only able to increase their number of votes in a few member states. In Italy, Poland and Sweden, on the other hand, these parties were able to increase their votes significantly. ^(Translated with) [^(www.DeepL.com/Translator)](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) ^((free version))",,/r/europe/comments/ezdch1/percentage_of_votes_for_a_more_restrictive/fgmi5a4/,ueberklaus,1580925039

2147,"1) there will never be no sort of agreement on Financial services, the eurozone is simply to dependent on the city of London for that to be the case. They can try to recreate what London does within the EU but that will take at least a decade. The shock of cutting off access completely at the end of the year would be extreme.

2) trade deals almost never include services in a meaningful way, and that’s because they don’t need to. What usually happens for financial services is mutual recognition of each other’s regulatory environment. The EU already does this for 3rd countries whether or not it has a FTA with them. It’s called ‘equivalence’

3) Financial services (all of them) are about 7% of the UK economy, compared with all types of services at around 80%. Now, some of that is domestic financial services and some of it is international. Difficult to separate out but, fwiw, London’s financial services are about 3.5% of GDP, and the UK’s net exports of financial services to the rest of the world is roughly double what it is to the EU.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ez83o4/eu_trade_chief_australiastyle_brexit_agreement/fgmi734/,MyFavouriteAxe,1580925068

On the question of being able to provide more accurate numbers myself, no probably not (the IMF has vastly more resources and data) but it was always clear to me these expectations were too pessimistic. If you check my post history you can see I've criticized the IMF in the past for exactly this so its not as if this hasn't been a recurring issue for them that many people have called them out for.

2197,"&gt;Nope, i didn't say that.

Sorry, you are quite right, that was the first person I replied to in the thread. I'll rephrase: This discussion started on tat basis, it was the starting point made by the OP, my counter that that was neither likely, desirable nor sensible for the EU to pursue.

&gt;Yes, just like the US did in regards to NS2. Which is why i find that to be such a huge dick move that i do consider an economic act of war.

It'd go counter to EU interests, and it'd invite retaliation, and the EU would never get the internal support to actually do it on that basis. I mean christ, the US wouldn't be able to do it either if it wasn't an executive power.

&gt;You can be for or against NS2, anybody can have an opinion about it and i won't belittle anybody for it. But those sanctions were a historical first and a very bad precedent for the future. Even many politicians in Germany who campaigned against NS2 were suddenly very united in calling the US out for it.

I agree. The point again though is that the US can use trade policy, foreign policy and executive power together to fuck about (at a massive cost to itself in terms of influence..). The EU can't, it doesn't have the exclusive competencies and power isn't centralised in the same way. It's theoretically possible, but practically impossible.

&gt;Yup, that was my point, not that it was in any way a good idea that anybody should even consider an option to employ.

Right. But when we return to the realms or possibility, the hardest option that the EU has is to not agree on trade at all. The UK would see a cost from that, but it'd be fairly minimal over a three year period. It likely would still leave the UK growing faster than the EU as a whole. 

However even that is unlikely to be seen as an incentive for member states who might want to leave the EU, not because the UK can't do well outside of the EU, but because most other member states don't have the same advantages that the UK has.

2222,"&gt; Such jobs are an an absolute minority of it. Exceptional people are exceptional, and are a minority. Majority of population does not in fact work in jobs where you need a huge intellectual commitement, majority works in jobs you could train a monkey to do.

Sure, I am not saying that I admire all the people who work in any kind of position. I admire exceptional people and being a mother really is nothing exceptional. Just like being a bartender is not really exceptional.

I also admire people who can organize their life in a way that they manage to have both families and jobs that pay solid money. That requires some effort. Because being self-sufficent, earning enough money to cover your needs and the needs of your kids is what a responsible adult should be able to do.

You can call it a lie, but this is what millions of people do all over the world just fine. Not sure what ridiculous expectations you have from mothers, but being a mother does not mean you have to give 100% of your attention to your kid. You don't have to be a failing mother if you also have a job.

&gt; So this will lead to less divorce and more children ? good. And yeah I mean, having a job of carrying food and plates 10 meters back and front is so much more fulfilling than taking care of children, we should applaud the people who have the required intellectual capacity to perform that job.

Erm, it's not necessarily more fullfilling, but it is definitely what brings money to your household. And you need the money to take care of the kids.

Of course you can also try to depend 100% on your partner, but A) single-income families are not possible for most households, you simply need both incomes to lead a comfortable life these days B) women don't want to depend on their partner anymore, because you must be prepared for a possible death or serious health issues in the family or for a possible divorce.

Okay so I think I misunderstood you slightly. I also think you misunderstood me, and that you're unaware of some of Sturgeon's stances. That's normal. You're well informed but you can't know everything that is reported here. Regarding the legality of the referendum, there was a small handful of radicals who supported an unofficial Catalan style referendum. They were shot down at the SNP party conference. Sturgeon stated just the other day that a second referendum must have legal backing. The party is totally opposed to not setting a legal precedent. I agree with you there and so do most independence backers here. What can we do though? We have to explore the legal route and that could he blocked by Westminster. That's the sad reality of it. All we can do is campaign for it. I'm confused about Spain's stance towards us to be honest. For years there was a lot of clarity as they opposed our separation from the UK and entry to the EU. Brussels, including Spain, have been more supportive of us recently but they weren't a few years ago. I understand that they were also trying to exploit division in the UK, but so is everyone else here.

Linke, SPD and Greens have 42 seats and were expected to be able to go through in the third ballot But they didn't. AFD, CDU and FDP have 48 Seats. MPs voted with 44 votes for incumbent Bodo Ramelow with a Leftist government and 45 votes for FDP Thuringia chief Thomas Kemmerich with no government or any policies. 1 abstained. Important to note that this was with backing of the AfD, the second-biggest party in Thuringia and a party CDU and FDP have previously said they will never work with.

Now FDP has the PM and can form a minority government, but a CDU-FDP government has only 26 PMs. It will not get any support from Linke, SPD or Greens. Which means it needs the support of AfD. So they either have to form a government with the AfD, which has 22 MPs, or it has to talk about literally everything with the AfD before making laws, which is basically the same as being in a government with the AfD, just unofficially and without AfD Ministers.

If they actually plan to make a deal with the AfD it will send shockwaves to Berlin and to the federal CDU and FDP leaders and this could lead to everything from federal CDU withdrawing support from Thuringia's CDU to the federal government, which still consists of CDU and SPD, breaking up as the SPD does not want to work with a party that works with the AfD.",Bavaria,/r/europe/comments/ez9n93/candidate_becomes_german_governor_with_farright/fglszz3/,YoooJan,1580910207

These aren't mutually exclusive.

The services the UK and Europe specialize in are not traded cross-border. For example financial services such as banking such as banking in the EU will be completely unavailable to British banks come a No Deal.

&gt;cutting themselves off from London would have disastrous consequences for the eurozones financial sector.

Of course not all of it, but currently 40% of UK financial services go to EU countries directly. The UK has also been steadfast in having the EU include services in FTAs with other countries, FTAs which the UK is leaving in 11 months. London specialties like Forex and clearing are of course be staying, but the question is will it remain such a large powerhouse as EU membership has allowed it to become?

&gt;Also, losing passporting rights isn't all that, as Moody's recently pointed out.

This has more to do with the UK and London than the banks themselves. All the banks need to do is put up subsidiaries in EU, which they already likely have, and they can go about conducting their business in the EU. However, this means a lot of capital previously domiciled in London and any tax revenue earned on this capital would be going to another country and not the Queen's coffers.

2394,"&gt; In terms of getting all the nutrients, meat is a lot more efficient than plants.

Any scientific source on that (not just an article in a newspaper that's an opinion instead of facts)?

&gt; Meat availability is not seasonal unlike plants and it doesn't have to fly half of the world to get to your plate.

Specific plants are seasonal. If you change the plants you eat depending on the time in the year, you can follow a plant based diet and eat regional and seasonal food without a problem. Most non regional food gets to us via ship (which is much less expensive and CO2 intensive than flying) and you are ignoring that even animals out of your region for meat production can get imported food.

&gt; The idea that individuals can save the planet by changing their diet is just stupid. it does have minimal impact on reversing climate change and at the same time drives attention away from real polluters like big oil/transport companies. 20 firms is responsible for third of global carbon emissions and none of them are from agricultural industry.

I 100% agree that only changing your diet won't save the planet and we shouldn't ignore the big polluters. However, eating plants doesn't impact your possibility to go for the 20 companies at all.

2485,"&gt;How long is a refugee allowed to stay?

As long as their refugee status is prolonged? IIRC if you are deemed a refugee you are allowed to stay for 3 or 5 years. Then you have to go through the process again.

&gt; Syrian war is reaching its last stages 

WW2 ended in 1945, yet it would have been absolute criminality to send refugees back to e.g. the USSR then. The Spanish Civil war ending did not mean it was safe for people to return to Spain, as an example. Russia is a ''safe'' country, but there are more than enough people that have valid refugee claims coming from Russia.

&gt; so if you are refugee from the war, you should be sent home once it's over. 

 The Syrian war ending will not mean it will be safe for *all* refugees to return home.

2556,"&gt;Spain is as liberal as France 

Not when it comes to gender issues. The gender employment gap (difference in male and female employment rates), for example, is one of the highest in Europe in Spain whereas France is lower than the European average.

&gt;high TFR ? Absolutely not.

Absolutely yes. Pays de la Loire had a fertility rate of around 2 in 2018. And a TFR of 1.9 **is** high, for developed world standards.

&gt;Let's play a guessing game, which city has a younger population also ? Hint, it's not Stockholm.

Stockholm actually is slightly younger than Malmo. By the way, the region with the highest TFR in Sweden is neither Malmo nor Stockholm but Smaland (whose immigrant population is lower than the country's average).

&gt;The same ? No. 

Yes. See https://i.imgur.com/qNl4GlN.png

&gt;And neither Finland nor Norway are even close to french TFR. Finland as liberal as france (or even more so) has a TFR of 1.35, as much as italy!

And Finland was at 1.9 as soon as 10 years ago - higher than France at the time. Bigger picture, once again.

&gt; I said the difference is meaningless. There is a very important distinction between those two. The end result is the same with both, that was my point. 

You mean that a very slight population decrease with little aging involved and that can easily be covered with a few skilled immigrants a year is the same end result as a population crash that sends a country among the most aged in the world and forces it to completely abandon its current pension scheme, among other things?

2585,"No it's not. If you give farmers just 100 or 200 euro per hectare, you keep inefficient farmers in business, preventing bigger more efficient farms from using that land more productively. It has nothing to do with regulations.

What you could do is transform the hectare subsidies to completely environmental subsidies, for example for maintaining hedge rows, where you don't pay them by the hectare, but just Y euro for maintaining X number of square meters of hedge rows, or other measures that improve biodiversity or other stuff. You could even offer subsidies for say more environmentally responsible ways to deal with manure, to prevent run-off from polluting streams. 

But then it is a subsidy for an ACTION, not for just possessing some land while being a farmer. At this point in time this is not where we are. Vast sums are paid every year on the basis of how many hectares a farm has. That should stop since it does not benefit food production, nor does it do anything to promote high food standards. If you want high food standards, you set rules for it that farmers (and slaughterhouses and factories that produce food) have to follow. You don't subsidize the farmers in the vague notion that they will then have more financial room to do the right thing.

2592,"&gt; You don't say. How is that relevant ?

The point is that while it was okay to function that way back then, it would not be possible today, societies that would try to replicate some 18th century lifestyle would not be competitive enough today.

I wasn't talking about 1950s or 1960s. I was talking about the pre-20th century era that Amish people live in.

&gt; Well that's absolutely false. Work productively ? We have so many jobs where the person who works such a job is less productive than a rock. Majority of positions in HR for example. But hey you gotta employ very unproductive people with gender studies or social science somehow. Who end up contributing nothing to productivity or society.

If an employer in a private sector gives them a job and pays them a salary, then clearly, they are not doing that out of the goodness of their heart. These people earn their money just like other employees and from the salary they pay taxes. Just because they work in a field that you think is not important enough does not mean they don't contribute.

&gt; Ask yourself if you ever had to deal with any government institutions, how many unproductive people worked there ? Majority.

This is one way to look at jobs in the public sector and many in my country have a similar look and I agree that the public administration could definitely be more efficient, that being said, just because someone is paid by public money, does not mean their jobs are unproductive. A lot of things could be automatized through digitalisation, but other things not such much, they require human creative, strategic thinking, emotional intelligence etc.

Obviously I am not saying we should go back to communism, where everyone had a job even if it was a totally useless job, but at the same time, we also cannot go back to the 18th century version of family planning. We need a balance there, a slowly growing population, not a population surge of uneducated people.

You can say that the technological development may eliminate a lot of jobs, but we don't really know that for sure. So far, the past technological revolutions did not eliminate the need of a human labour, they just eliminated certain positions while creating others.

&gt; And to finish answering this, even if we take your idea of banning women from work, the increase in birth rates would lead to more workers, and thus invalidating your point upwards of our modern society losing half the capital. It wouldn't, just the capital that was women would in 20 years be men.

And what would happen in the meantime, before the new generation of workers reached adulthood? How would a country deal with a sudden structural shock? It would be massively losing out on the global stage and 20 years is a god damn long time to wait before you can fill up the wholes at the labour market. And then when those kids actually reached the adulthood, they would enter a collapsing economy and it would suddenly be too many of them. Again, there needs to be a balance between, a slight growth in the working population is desired, hence it's undesirable to cut too many people out of the labour market, but at the same time, a sudden population explosion is not desirable.

&gt; A. I'm not advocating 6-7 birth rates, I'd be happy with 2.5.

Well fine, but how does that correspond with your idea to take an inspiration from the Amish lifestyle? Like what exact inspiration would you take - no family planning, no contraceptives, assign the women the role of a housewife and a mother only? Because that's how the live pretty much. That is how you get to 6-7 fertility rate, not to 2.5. 

&gt; Also how can you reconcile the idea that our modern societies count on as many people as possible working productively and that having low birth rates results from that ?

Our economic model does that and the low fertility rates are just a side effect, an undesirable side effect you could say, not something that was intended.

Britain’s demands for its negotiations with the EU are unrealistic

--

Boris Johnson has an autonomy fetish. The UK prime minister’s fetish is the belief that his country not only has the sovereign right to shoot itself in both feet, but also has a duty to do so if the alternative is to allow EU institutions any role in its affairs. Brexit, he insists, means autonomy. If he persists with this demand, it is likely that, early next year, the UK will suffer the complete rupture of trading relationships it has built up over 47 years.

Yesterday, the British government presented its [demands](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-future-relationship-between-the-uk-and-the-eu) for these negotiations. Unfortunately, they are unrealistic in three respects: the first is the hope that any agreement will be between “sovereign equals”; the second is the belief that the EU would agree a Canada-style agreement; and the third is that an Australian relationship with the EU, governed by World Trade Organization rules, is a reasonable alternative.

As a matter of international law, the UK is sovereign. But [sovereignty is not the same thing as power](https://www.ft.com/content/fece7238-1071-11e6-91da-096d89bd2173). The EU has 446m people, against the UK’s 66m. Its economy is almost six times as big as the UK’s. The EU is also [much less dependent](https://np.reddit.com/r/brexit/comments/ev9lh4/britain_after_brexit_will_not_be_alone_but_it/ffu9cty/) on trade with the UK than is true the other way round. Let us be clear: this is not a relationship between equals.

The difficulty for the UK in its relationship with the EU is rather that it is too small to be an equal and too big not to matter. It is almost as important a trading partner of the EU as the US. That is because [distance is crucial in determining bilateral trade flows](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/bpgmpd/global_britain_is_an_illusion_because_distance/ensuajr/). Since the UK is a far more important trading partner of the EU than Canada, the bloc is also more wary of Britain’s capacity to disrupt its economy. At the same time, for Australia, trade with the EU is negligible. But the EU is the UK’s most important trading partner. The UK must not accept the same trade relationship with the EU as Australia’s.

[The EU’s characteristically thorough mandate](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-annex-negotiating-directives.pdf) for the talks makes clear how it sees the negotiations. First, Brussels sees the “new partnership” as a “single package”. This is to cover “general arrangements” including the provisions on governance; “economic arrangements including trade and *level playing field guarantees*” (my emphasis); and security arrangements including law enforcement and judicial co-operation, foreign policy, security and defence.

Second, the issues are many and complex. These include data protection, participation in EU and Euratom nuclear programmes, trade in goods and services, intellectual property, public procurement, mobility of people, aviation, road transport, energy, fisheries, judicial co-operation, foreign policy co-operation and cyber security. It beggars belief that all this can be agreed and ratified within a year. The idea that the UK should walk away if all this cannot be agreed in that brief time seems insane.

Finally, the EU states that “given the . . . UK’s geographic proximity and economic interdependence, the envisaged partnership must ensure open and fair competition . . . To that end, the envisaged agreement should uphold the common high standards in the areas of state aid, competition, state-owned enterprises, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, and relevant tax matters.” What the EU is saying here is that your autonomy stops where it inconveniences us. If the UK insists upon it, then the deal it seeks may not be agreed.

To the reasonable conclusion that no deal is likely, three replies are possible.

The first is that the EU will give in. That is quite unlikely. For the EU to back down on the issue of the “level playing field”, to take one example, would require it to trust the UK not to compete by undermining the EU’s standards. But what else — the EU will ask — is all this freedom for? What else have Brexiters been saying it is for? You are asking us to trust you, Mr Johnson. Why should we?

A second response is that it does not matter to the UK if no deal is reached. But it does. Even if the failure were “only” on the trade aspects of the negotiations, with other parts agreed, which is unlikely, the costs for the UK of a sudden disruption might be huge. [In 2018, the government’s own analysis concluded](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/760484/28_November_EU_Exit_-_Long-term_economic_analysis__1_.pdf) that the UK economy might end up between 6 and 9 per cent smaller, in the long run, under a “no-deal” scenario. This is significantly worse than the already bad outcome of a free trade agreement in goods. Moreover, a sudden shift from current arrangements would impose a shock. The UK would not, as Mr Johnson claims, “prosper mightily”. Responsible governments do not inflict such shocks on their economies.

A last response is that, in the end, Mr Johnson will retreat from his red lines. That is what he did last October over the Irish border issue, when he accepted the economic dismemberment of his own country, something his predecessor had refused outright, all the while denying he had done any such thing. The ability to surrender while successfully insisting that one has not is a form of genius. Maybe, the prime minister can find a description for humiliating surrenders that dress them up as great victories. I would certainly not put it past him.

This, however, is hope against hope. As things stand, there is a fundamental conflict over the scope of the envisaged agreements, over governance of the new deal and, probably most vexing, over data, fish and the “level playing field”. There is in brief much disagreement over the nature of the prospective relationship and very little time in which to agree. A likely result is no deal. If so, the greater the ensuing disruption, the more the Johnson government is likely to try to blame it on the EU. It might even seek revenge, possibly by trying to ally itself with the US against the EU.

Above all, remember this: a limited free trade agreement would be better than no deal; but it will still hurt.

2641,"&gt;Yeah exactly, there can be a vote every seven years if the people are showing the demand for it. And the support of the SNP could be seen as the demand

Again, not correct. The vote can only be held if the secretary of state believes it is likely that a reunification vote will win, not just because people want a vote and there must be a seven year gap minimum between the votes. The SNP support in Scotland was around 30% of the Scottish population (with 45% of votes cast). If we pretend that the NI law somehow applies to Scotland, clearly that isn't a likely chance of leave winning hence no reason to ha the vote. There are far better ways of deciding whether a vote should happen.

&gt;Alex did say that, but the NO side also said that the only way to stay be the EU is if we voted no. Things changed quite a lot

Yes lied about the EU (the ""transition into the EU"" claim which the EU said couldn't happen), NATO, keeping the pound, spending calculations based on oil at $100 a barrel and so on. It's a vote campaign, they're dishonest. However, on the EU specifically, the No camp were correct at the time that the only way to stay in the EU was to remain in the UK, no-one knew what the outcome of a referendum would be.

2721,"Death rate from cancer highest in Hungary, lowest in Cyprus

Across the European Union, there were 257 deaths from cancer per 100 000 inhabitants in 2016. With 345 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, Hungary recorded the highest age-standardised death rate from cancer among the EU Member States. High death rates from cancer were also registered in Croatia (334), Slovakia (315) and Slovenia (309).

In contrast, low death rates from cancer were recorded in a number of Mediterranean and Nordic countries. The lowest rate was recorded in Cyprus with 194 deaths from cancer per 100 000 inhabitants, followed by Finland (220), Malta (221), Sweden (229) and Spain (230).

Over the period from 2011 to 2016, the age-standardised death rate has fallen slowly but steadily, from 266 deaths from cancer per 100 000 inhabitants in 2011 to 257 in 2016.

Men (656 100 deaths due to cancer) were more affected than women (511 600). Cancer caused 29% of deaths of men and around 23% of deaths of women in 2016. Fatal cancers caused 288 900 deaths among people younger than 65 years in the EU, corresponding to 37% of all deaths in this age group, while less than one quarter (878 800 deaths, 23%) of all deaths among those aged 65 and above.

Main fatal cancers: lung cancer for men, breast cancer for women

Lung cancer claimed 239 000 lives in the EU in 2016, accounting for one fifth (20%) of all deaths due to cancer. Colorectal cancer (139 700 deaths, 12% of all deaths due to cancer), breast cancer (85 300, 7%), pancreatic cancers (78 700, 7%) and prostate cancer (65 200, 6%) were also frequent causes of death.

Lung cancer was the main fatal cancer form for men, being responsible for one quarter (165 000 deaths, 25%) of all male deaths from cancer. This was far more than colorectal cancer (77 400, 12%) and prostate cancer (65 200, 10%). Breast cancer (84 300 deaths, 16% of all female deaths due to cancer), lung cancer (74 100, 14%) and colorectal cancer (62 300, 12%) caused the most cancer deaths among women in the EU in 2016.",,/r/europe/comments/ez4ybb/almost_12_million_persons_died_from_cancer_in_the/fgl5y3b/,isamson,1580883126

2790,"Dude.. we aren’t talking about the contribution of ALL immigrant women, or even immigrant women as a whole. I’m talking about Muslims having a higher TFR due to primarily cultural/religious factors in France, which is a big reason why their TFR is 1.90 and not 1.59. 

We are talking past each other here, but here are my calculations. France’s Muslim population is estimated at 8-12%. Taking a midpoint of 10%, with a TFR of 2.9 (against 1.9 as a whole for France, as per Pew Research) gives us 29 out of 190 children per 100 women. That leaves 161 children for 90 non-Muslim women, giving a non-Muslim TFR of 1.78. Good, but not much higher than the 1.59 EU average and certainly not close enough to replacement levels.

Why I’m even making this point is to show that fertility is strongly linked to culture/religion, and all the best social programs in Europe only get us to ~1.7. If you want to increase TFR, sure, make society as family friendly as possible. But unless we adopt a cultural model that places a premium on fertility it will not get us to 2.1.",,/r/europe/comments/eyo7k7/poland_experiences_lowest_birth_rate_since_wwii/fgkwezb/,EuroDemos,1580875198

2793,"Islam is rotten at its heart and cannot be reformed. It's long past time the West took a very close look at Islam, and faced the fact it's a ruthless system of mind control established by a psychopath for his own amusement. The central tenets of Islam are entirely incompatible with even the economy version of civilisation.

Freedom of thought and speech, freedom of association, education not indoctrination, separation of church and state, reverence for human life, even freedom of individual conscience itself, all are haram, despised, in Islam. 

Equality of the sexes, rule of law (real law not mumbo jumbo), respect for minorities, tolerance of difference, all will have no place when the Caliphate is established. 

It is time to stop pretending all religions are from some sort of cookie cutter in the sky, all of exactly equal merit. Islam is a clear and present danger to civilisation and it must be defeated, not by scorching the sands of the Middle-east, but by arguing the case in every public forum we can find. 

This is not a matter of culture, or simply seeing the world in a different way. Islam is the personal creation of one of the vilest, cruellest, most licentious and bloodthirsty monsters of history, the prophet Muhammad. People who want to live in the twenty-first century not the middle ages need to wake up to the danger Islam poses.

There is no moderate Islam. There are hundreds of millions of moderate Muslims and many live exemplary lives, but they are moderate in spite of Islam, not because of it. My point is that it's essential this argument must be about Islam, not Muslims. Muslims are the main victims here.

The West needs to explain to the Muslim world is that Islam is implacably opposed to what we all actually want, a world that gives every individual a fair chance to be their best self and contribute as much as they can for the betterment of the whole community.

Islam is an accident of history, a cluster of really bad ideas that has held together for fourteen hundred years, mostly because it's such an effective means of mind control. Every generation sees a new crop of parasite mullahs who use it to exercise brutal control over their victims.

There needs to be a knock-down-drag-out contest in the marketplace of ideas, about Islam. Is there a place in the civilised world for a religion that advocates killing those who leave the faith? That believes women are inherently inferior to men? That actually promotes the idea of middle aged men having sex with children? Clearly, inevitably, the outcome of such a conversation can only be one thing, banishment of Islam from civilised society.

Islam may be a successful cult but it's a cult. Islam, at its dark heart, wants only one thing - its own success as an organisation. Every part of Islam's sacred writings directs us constantly toward one thing, Muslims have a divine obligation to obey, promote and extend Islam and there is nothing in their lives that is more important than that all-consuming purpose. 

That's how you kickstart a cult to be still going 1400 years later. 

It's time to shine some daylight into the dark heart of Islam and get the world to agree it just has no place in any civilised community. Let's set these wretched people free from their cruel medieval superstition.",,/r/europe/comments/eyqpi9/blasphemy_row_in_france_over_teens_post_on_islam/fgkwsnj/,macsta,1580875469

2857,"Here's a list of fascist basics that the Trump administration and the Third Reich share, it's Fascism 101: 

Undermine public trust in the media. People must listen only to ""information"" from the fascist party or fascist media (like the Murdoch gutter press).

Blame the victims of harsh social policy. The poor deserve their fate.

Encourage people to see political opponents as criminals (lock her up), and less than fully human (libtard).

Maintain a permanent atmosphere of chaos, fear and imminent threat.

 Attack minorities and anyone who's ""different"". Stress their inferiority. Associate one group as the embodiment of threat (for Hitler the Jews, for Trump the refugees, for Erdogan the Kurds) and concentrate hate and fear on that group in particular.

Democracy is only to be tolerated when the results are not in doubt, 
political opponents are criminalised, disenfranchised, and depersonalised. 
Usually if hate and fear are maintained at a sufficiently high level democracy isn't too much of a problem, terrified people vote as they're told.

Fascists routinely accuse their opponents of those illicit things they themselves are doing, Trump does this constantly, straight out of the Joe Goebbels handbook. 

Worship the military and measure national success in military terms.

Use tame religion as an arm of government. 

Nobble the rule of law by stacking the courts with political hacks (like the loathsome Mr Kavanaugh and hundreds of others).

These are the blueprints of the Third Reich that have been laid across Washington. 

And of course, at the heart of both the Third Reich and the Trump administration lies a nest of large scale corruption, to ensure the executive and their corporate enablers can plunder the national treasury on an epic scale.",,/r/europe/comments/eyqpi9/blasphemy_row_in_france_over_teens_post_on_islam/fgl0k89/,macsta,1580878356

2914,"Actually he is a bit misleading. There are no ethnic hungarians in the eastern part of Romania. In the east there's the Moldova part of Romania. They are concentrated in the center of Romania, and a bit less toward north and west. The Szekely land as we call it, is part of Transylvania region, in the center of Romania. The szekely people are part of the settlers  that conquered Transylvania a bit more than a thousands years ago. Since then Transylvania was a voivodeship under Kingdom of Hungary, a principality (semi-independent), a vassal state of the Ottomans, or part of the Habsburgs, and then united with the other regions under Romania because the majority of ethnic romanian and saxons voted for unity. So it wasn't just hungarian, but it was under hungarian rule for a long time. 

The szekely people nowadays like to identify themselves as hungarian, hence only 500+ something declared themselves szekely in Romania, rest of them calling themselves ethnic hungarians, despite us calling them szekely. Probably because they got free hungarian citizenship in the past. They are in total a bit more than 1.2 millions, not 1.5 as he mentioned.

&gt; 
&gt; The EU has an energy efficiency target of reducing energy consumption by 20% by 2020. The primary energy consumption should amount to no more than 1 312 Mtoe and final energy consumption to no more than 959 Mtoe in 2020. The EU energy efficiency target for 2030 aims at a primary energy consumption of no more than 1 128 Mtoe and a final energy consumption of no more than 846 Mtoe.
&gt; 
&gt; Primary energy consumption measures total domestic energy demand, while final energy consumption refers to what end users actually consume. The difference relates mainly to what the energy sector needs itself and to transformation and distribution losses.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2018, primary energy consumption in the EU was 4.9% above the efficiency target for 2020 and 22.0% away from the 2030 target.

I take serious issue with the implications here and you should reconsider your one sentence historical comparison. In no way can the refugees from Iraq/Syria/Afghanistan be compared to the fucking Huns.

&gt;we have no control about what's going on there

That's the sort of isolationist defeatism I don't subscribe. We certainly can strongly influence the world around us, as I recall we've been doing it for the better part of the last few centuries, in various ways. There's no need for the West to reform and remodel all the world, but only to support a situation of 'good enough governance' that allows for some sort of stability. Which makes sense in a world that's economically interdependent and where travel is fairly easy compared to bygone times.

Even if that doesn't work out, we still have other options that have not been duly considered. For one, reducing our dependence on US military means - so that we may engage in interventionism in our own interest (to stop escalation in civil wars and the resulting refugee streams) or to be able to resist US interventionist hobbyism in the Middle East which has brought us where we are today.

Your implied option, i.e. building walls, would necessitate European countries to disregard international law, their own constitutions and to act against their economic self-interest.

Because it's more ""organic"" rather than the result of machinations and conflicts between countries.

So it would hit all meat, not just meat produced inside the EU. And the EU could still protect it's markets like it already does now, restricting the amounts of certain types of food that can be imported at lower or no tariffs. So, there is no reason to assume it would put domestic producers at a disadvantage compared to outside EU-producers. All it would do is start pushing farmers to shift away from meat production as demand drops. So you should start out with a low levy/tax and slowly increase it over time. Start with a tax at 10% of the final amount, set the start date say 3-5 years from now, then incrementally increase it by 10% a year until it hits it's intended level after 10 more years.",,/r/europe/comments/eyw1wx/eu_urged_to_adopt_meat_tax_to_tackle_climate/fgjxa6j/,slvk,1580853184

3225,"The numbers I mentioned are from the article you posted. If you have a newer source post it. But at least you are not denying it.   
Also, the whole point of my comment was that the sanctions are not bad for us and they are even according to the article are doing something, despite Russia not going down in flames, which EU never wanted in the first place.   
So I do not really see how someone can say, that this proofs in any way that we should scrap them. (Also, I am not saying you said that just was hoping most people won't think that).

&gt;All developed countries grow below global average. 

Not always, and I did not say, all of the developed countries are growing above the global average.  I said all of Eastern EU members are outgrowing Russia. 

Also, if we are counting Russia as one of the developed countries, then it still stands, that there are richer countries than Russia in the EU who will grow faster than them, and even the same or slightly faster than the mentioned global average of 3%.

Poland for example, for 2020 Hungary as well, Romania. The list of richer countries with above 1,6% would be longer, even the one for slowdowns which will be still above Russian 1,8% for 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;V4 is expected to slow down, the recent growth was driven mostly by immigration from Ukraine and rising property prices. At least here in CZ.

Facts pulled straight out of a hat, the best source of economic data. Where do you get that? The reports from [analytical companies](https://www2.deloitte.com/cz/cs/pages/about-deloitte/articles/vyhledy-ceske-ekonomiky-pro-rok-2020.html) say that the growth for Czechia is still at pessimistic 2% for 2020, more than your article gives to Russia, despite Czechia being a more developed and richer country.   
Also, saying that immigration was the main or one of the main growth factors is at best dishonest to say. Exports grew less than expected, but grew, wages as well, the consumer index was up less than expected but was up as well.   


Slovakia will be in downgraded pessimistic terms [2,4%](https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22220632/slovakia-national-bank-forecast-economy-is-going-downhill.html) up in 2020, Poland above [3%](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-performance-and-forecasts/economic-performance-country/poland/economic-forecast-poland_en) according to (literally any source if you do not believe EU) and Hungary [3,3% for 2020 and 2,9%](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-gdp-in-2020-here-are-the-predictions/) for 2021.  


So yeah, I mean, if we disregard the real numbers, it almost looks like optimistic Russian economic acceleration is better than our pessimistic slowdown unless you think about how their acceleration is still to be lower while being poorer.   


So not sure why you are trying to make their worse future numbers look better than our better future numbers.

Of course, all %s above 50 have the difficulty of a majority not winning (but that happens with our elections anyway so....).

3236,"&gt; The modern system has robbed most women of their most fertile age to pursue a career. 

Isn't it strange that those who are not pursuing a career and getting an education have the highest amount of childlessness?

Weird that you aren't concerned of the fact that men are wasting their most fertile and healthy years too. Or well, it's not weird since the amount of Finnish men who genuinely believe a man's fertility and sperm quality are the same at 24 and 40 is just astonishing. Since you know, those women can't reproduce by themselves and singling women in an issue like this is mindless. 


&gt;I think a good solution would be to opt for much longer maternity/paternity leave, shorter retirement and to encourage studies after you had children.

 First of all, a longer maternity leave than we have no serves nothing. That's the last thing to raise fertility rates. 

If you are the average, young, healthy couple, you are perfectly capable of having plenty of kids after finishing university. If we were aiming for 2-3 kids per couple, the majority of people could comfortably start at their mid,late twenties and even early thirties. The problem is that people aren't doing that. 

A scenario where 19-20-year old women AND MEN (since you know, women are attracted to men their age and slightly older, and a scenario where women would in mass choose men 10 years older than them is _never_ going to happen) would start voluntarily having babies before going to university and living their lives is never going to happen.

It said the Tinder probe came about as a result of active monitoring of complaints received from individuals “both in Ireland and across the EU” in order to identify “thematic and possible systemic data protection issues”.

“The Inquiry of the DPC will set out to establish whether the company has a legal basis for the ongoing processing of its users’ personal data and whether it meets its obligations as a data controller with regard to transparency and its compliance with data subject right’s requests,” the DPC added.

It’s not clear exactly which GDPR rights have been complained about by Tinder users at this stage. But some users have accused the company of not providing a copy of all the data it holds on them

We’ve reached out to Tinder for a response to the DPC’s investigation. **Update:** Tinder’s parent company, Match Group, has now sent us this statement: “Transparency and protecting our users’ personal data is of utmost importance to us. We are fully cooperating with the Data Protection Commission, and will continue to abide by GDPR and all applicable laws.”

Also today the DPC has finally responded to long-standing complaints by consumer rights groups of **Google’s** handling of location data, announcing a formal investigation of that, too.""",,/r/europe/comments/eyu09l/tinders_handling_of_user_data_is_now_under_gdpr/fgj8pzq/,TwistCrafty,1580839189

The UK is a bigger competitive threat to the single market than Canada, therefore the EU will make tougher demands.

I don't for a second believe the US would use a nuke on anyone attacking Poland or Germany, irrelevant of what it claims. I do also believe that it would be foolish to test the US on that assumption.

&gt;The US military disagrees. The B61 bomb is going through yet another modification in 2020. The place of tactical nukes in military strategy is questionable, but the B61 works perfectly well for that purpose.

The US military also still uses more than half a century old B-52 bombers; and Germany is about to certify an aircraft able to carry that outdated B61. That's all show, all politics. If we're at the point where nukes are flying we will not send manned fighter aircraft into enemy airspace to carry bombs, we'll use intercontinental missiles.

A small nuke carried by a manned fighter that depends on penetrating enemy air defenses does nothing for nuclear deterrence. Once nuclear deterrence failed and nuclear war began, it may be of some limited use if the fighter pilot is incredibly lucky. Nuclear deterrence however is provided not by Rafales or Tornados with their small bombs that take ages to arrive on target but by submarines and silos full of nuclear-tipped, fast ballistic, glide and cruse missiles.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/eyngdy/prominent_german_politician_calls_on_france_to/fgj8viv/,Bojarow,1580839278

&gt;The Treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to Member States to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. 
https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/euro-area/enlargement-euro-area/who-can-join-and-when_en

&gt; Or can you join the EU and indefinitely use another currency because your deficit prevents you joining the euro? 

Yes, but joining an international treaty on false pretences is usually frowned upon. In international treaties, between sovereign countries, there is no ""law"", only an honor system. 

&gt;It begs the question of what currency an independent Scotland will use - clearly neither the British pound nor the euro.

It's been done a hundred times in the past century alone, there are at least 15 different scenarios. Scotland can continue to use the GBP or use the euro, the way Kosovo uses the euro. Frankly the currency is the least of the worries, as said, it's been done before. Kazachstan changed it currency overnight when it broke from the USSR/CIS, countries switched to the euro overnight, Turkey went to New Lira overnight. It's a non-issue. It's like worrying about who will tuck them in when you child announces he will leave home.

My guess is they'll keep on using the GBP untill they switch to their own currency on a 1:1 parity. Don't the NI have their own NI pound?

Scotland meets most of the criteria:

*Be in Europe (this is often overlooked as an implicit criteria)*

*stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities;*

As Scotland was already in the EU, this needs no further assessment, unless a future Scottish constitution starts discriminating the English 

*economic criteria: a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces;*

Scotland is not an ex-comecon country with a dysfunctional economy planned out of Moscou.

*administrative and institutional capacity to effectively implement the acquis and ability to take on the obligations of membership.*

This is where some work is needed as Scotland misses some of the institutional framework: a veterinary inspection, a national metrology institute, chemical inspection, REACH registry..

3636,"This is one of the most stupid statistics Eurostat makes. Why would you take *gross* wages and adjust them to price levels?

Just to illustrate, different countries have different ideas of what is a ""gross wage"". Even worse, they sometimes change the definition. Lithuania and Romania are two countries that, in recent years, changed it to include the entirety of labour costs. Meanwhile, other countries exclude some massive share of the labour costs, like Estonia and its 33% social tax.

Hence, you get numbers that are quite pointless to compare. Lithuania and Romania appear to have had huge spikes in gross wages, whereas a big part of it is just bookkeeping tricks. 

Just see what happens if you actually look how much the employee receives (gross minimum wage –&gt; net minimum wage):

* Romania 468€ –&gt; 283€
* Bulgaria 312€ –&gt; 242€
* Lithuania 607€ –&gt; 437€
* Estonia 584€ –&gt; 546€

It becomes an entirely different story.

Eurostat even made a graph to show how much have gross minimum wages grown and, surprise-surprise, Romania and Lithuania shine at the top. There's not even an explanation that it's largely due to simple bookkeeping changes.

3647,"&gt;A 19th-century palace in prime position in the centre of the Vatican has been converted into a homeless shelter on Pope  Francis' orders.  
&gt;  
&gt;Palazzo Migliori, which was constructed in the early 1800s, served as the headquarters of the all-female Calasanziane religious order, which used the building to care for young single  mothers.  
&gt;  
&gt;After occupying the building for 70 years, the order relocated to new premises last year and the palace was renovated, leading to questions about how it would be used.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sitting on prime  real estate just off St Peter's Square, the building could have  generated significant income for the Catholic Church as a luxury hotel, but Pope Francis had other intentions.  
&gt;  
&gt;On its news website Vatican News, the Vatican said Pope Francis personally directed his Almoner Cardinal Konrad Krajewski (his officer in charge of distributing services to the poor) to convert it into a homeless shelter.   
&gt;  
&gt;The four-storey building will house around 50 men and women, although  the 16-bedroom facility has capacity for more during cold winter temperatures, Cardinal Krajewski said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The lower levels will be used to provide social support to the occupants, including computing, reading, recreation, and psychological counselling.  
&gt;  
&gt;Volunteers can also use the building to prepare meals for homeless people who were sheltering elsewhere.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cardinal Krajewski said the Vatican requested the construction company in charge of renovating the building employ homeless people during the overhaul.   
&gt;  
&gt;It is not the first time Pope Francis has implemented practical measures to help the poor and homeless in Vatican City.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last  year, Cardinal Krajewski — on the pontiff's orders — broke a police  barrier and shimmied down a Rome manhole in order to restore electricity  for hundreds of homeless people living in an unused building.",,/r/europe/comments/eyox2r/pope_francis_arranges_for_19th_century_palazzo/fgicymk/,Jarijari7,1580817267

It was: 

&gt;“[…] if we look at what remains if you strip away these hated delineations that we have listed: non-Hungarians, others, migrants, Roma, I don’t know what, then there is this scary formation left in the middle: white, Christian, heterosexual men – and there are of course (some) women among them. That’s the family concept. And this is terrible, because if we look at what the so-called white nationalists are made up of all over the world: that’s it…”

So government supporters arranged a so-called (clearly tongue in cheek) anti-discrimination and anti-racism protest which featured Zsolt Bayer and other prominent government media figures where they pretended to be condemning racism and called for the mayor's resignation.

3745,"Designed by a pool of architects that included [Gio Ponti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gio_Ponti) and [Pier Luigi Nervi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Luigi_Nervi), the Pirellone was built between 1956 and 1960, and served as an office building for the Pirelli company until 1978, when it was bought by the regional government of Lombardy, becoming the headquarters of the Regional Council of Lombardy. At the time of its construction, it became a symbol of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, and of the growth and modernization of Milan.

With thirty-one floors and a height of 127 meters, the Pirellone was the tallest skyscraper in Italy (second tallest building in the country, after the Mole Antonelliana in Turin) and the tallest skyscraper in the European Union until 1966, when the Tour du Midi in Brussels (148 meters) was built. It remained the tallest building in Milan until 2010, when it was surpassed by the new Palazzo Lombardia (161 meters, also owned by the regional government). Its design influenced other skyscrapers built during the following years, such as the MetLife Building in New York, the Lonza Tower in Basel, the Banco Atlantico Tower in Barcelona and the West Plaza in Auckland. 

As tradition prohibited any building in Milan from being higher than the statue of the Virgin Mary (the *Madonnina*, or *Madunina*, as the Milanese would say) that stands atop the Duomo, a [slightly smaller copy of the *Madunina*](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/UH4Qbcx5Z5t8nmTpycSe7u84uhyBacwCxNsdHpe7zU_cbtjhdHwf9D5mICoKGDvR8sZflifpQDfujPTsTddt-WC4nZahrUF1G2kTZDfmzgjWFUc) was placed on the top of the skyscraper (this was later done with Palazzo Lombardia as well, and then with the Unicredit Tower, which topped the latter).

In April 2002 a small Rockwell Commander four-seat plane chrashed into the 26th floor of the Pirellone in unclear circumstances, killing the pilot and two regional employees and causing serious damage that required nearly two years of repairs. This accident, which happened just seven months after the 9/11 attacks, initially raised fears of a terrorist attack, and even impacted (briefly) the stock markets in Europe and the United States. The central section of the 26th floor has since become a memorial to the victims.

Since 2017 [a pair of peregrine falcons, nicknamed Giò and Giulia (after the architect Giò Ponti and his wife, Giulia Vimercati), have taken up the roof of the Pirellone as their residence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nygiz07fdGk).",Lombardy,/r/europe/comments/eynukc/skyscrapers_of_milan_the_pirelli_tower_aka_the/fgi7ydh/,Lavrentio2LaVendetta,1580810339

3838,"&gt; I agree the numbers seems exaggerated. But you probably have to see it in combination with the fact that 69% of US citizens have less than $1000 in savings

I agree a significant portion of the population doesn't have much saved, but that article is about *savings accounts*. Which isn't a good indicator of how much money someone has kept away because they've become worthless. 

I put a thousand dollars an elderly family member gave to me as a gift into one with a bank I didn't use for any other purpose a few years ago at her instance and basically forgot about it until three (I think) years later after they had died. I had never logged into my account once to check it and it was actually on the verge of being declared an inactive account and taken by the state I live in when I walked into one of their branches and just closed the account and took my money.

No charge to set up the account with the check my relative gave me because I was a first time customer and no charge to close it. I cant remember the exact amount I had accrued via interest over that three years but I remember it was less than 10 dollars. No one aside from the elderly who don't know any better uses them anymore, even a checking account with some kind a ""earn cash back on X"" scheme would be more beneficial to someone who doesn't have enough to invest in stocks or something else.

&gt; and the fact that out of pocket health care costs are high (one single trip in the ambulance can cost you more than $1000

Anyone who qualifies to be on SNAP (food stamps) is almost certainly going to qualify for Medicaid (government payed for health care) as well.

3848," **Article 30** (repealed in 2000) forbade religious instruction in state schools for students between six and thirteen years of age. 

 When the 1905 legislation superseded the Concordat elsewhere in France, Alsace-Lorraine was part of the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire); thus, the 1905 law has never applied there 

 Although the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State initially was a particularly ""painful and traumatic event"" for the Catholic Church in France,the French Government began making serious strides towards reconciliation with the Catholic Church later during the 1920s by both recognizing the social impact of organized religion in France and amending the law itself through new legislation and rendering court decisions that were favorable to organized religion in France. In 1921 the Catholic Church and French State began a series of negotiations for ""pacification of law"" in respect to both civil and canon law to create a harmonious day-to-day working relationship. These negotiations culminated in 1926 when [Aristide Briand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristide_Briand) negotiated the [Briand-Ceretti Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briand-Ceretti_Agreement) with the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See) whereby the state reclaimed a role in the process of choosing diocesan bishops. 

 most Roman Catholic churches in the country were built well before the enactment of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, and thus are maintained at full public expense

3871,"As of 1 January 2020, 21 out of the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU) have national minimum wages: only Denmark, Italy, Cyprus, Austria, Finland and Sweden do not have any.

In January 2020, Bulgaria had the lowest gross* minimum wage (€312) across the EU. Nine Member States, predominantly located in the east of the EU, followed with minimum wages between €400 and around €600 per month: Latvia (€430), Romania (€466), Hungary (€487), Croatia (€546), Czechia (€575), Slovakia (€580), Estonia (€584), Lithuania (€607) and Poland (€611).

In five other Member States, located mainly in the south of the EU, minimum wages ranged between €700 and just over €1 000 per month: Portugal (€741), Greece (€758), Malta (€777), Slovenia (€941) and Spain (€1 050).

In the remaining seven Member States, all located in the west and north of the EU, minimum wages were above €1 500 per month: France (€1 539), Germany (€1 584), Belgium (€1 594), the Netherlands (€1 636), Ireland (€1 656) and Luxembourg (€2 142).

For comparison, the federal minimum wage in the United States was €1 119 per month in January 2020.

Smaller gaps in minimum wages once price level differences are eliminated

Across the 21 Member States concerned, the highest minimum wage in the EU was almost 7 times higher than the lowest.

However, the disparities in minimum wages across the EU Member States are considerably smaller once price level differences are taken into account: minimum wages in Member States with lower price levels become relatively higher when expressed in purchasing power standard (PPS), and relatively lower in Member States with higher price levels.

By eliminating price differences, minimum wages ranged from 579 PPS per month in Latvia and 618 PPS in Bulgaria to 1 705 PPS in Luxembourg, meaning that the highest minimum wage more than 3 times higher than the lowest.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/eyla0k/disparities_in_minimum_wages_across_the_eu/fghvajc/,filosoful,1580794920

Conclusion:

&gt;As Murphy (66) has argued: “Biomedical research and its social applications are almost always worthy of sustained critical scrutiny” (p. 11). In the case of circumcision, in particular – originally a ritual practice with a long history of being dubiously medicalized (67) – it is important to be especially skeptical (12). **At the end of the day, it is not altogether clear that a minor reduction in the absolute risk of certain infections or diseases – whose prevalence in developed nations is generally low, and whose occurrence can typically be avoided by other, less injurious means8 – is worth the ‘trade-off’ of losing a part of one’s penis. What is certain, however, is that the answer to this question is likely to be highly subjective**, and to depend upon numerous, unpredictable, and ultimately personal factors [see Ref. (24)]. Therefore, it should be up to the affected individual himself (or indeed herself, in analogous circumstances) to decide about permanent genital-modification surgeries at such a time as he or she can meaningfully factor in his or her own preferences and values [see Ref. (46, 48, 51)]9. Circumcision before an age of consent is not a desirable health-promotion strategy, given more effective, and less ethically problematic, alternatives.""",Canada,/r/europe/comments/ey583m/children_being_circumcised_without_consent_of/fghvxag/,puljujarvifan,1580795486

Pointing out that the Saar offensive didn't deliver is a pointless meme at this point, all recent studies on the subject have given the same result: with Poland falling so fast, the French army would not have been able to deliver a killing blow without risking a complete stall.

4347,"&gt; How is starting a political advocacy campaign not possible?

Of course it's possible, but might not be legal.

&gt; Starting a campaign for a secession would be sedition?

It can be. Perhaps you haven't been paying attention to Catalunha. ""Advocacy"" got them nowhere, then moved onto outright rebellion. That's how such things end if there's no built-in mechanism to secede.

&gt; It would be an act of Parliament, which would mean that there is, in fact, a legal mean for secession.

Again, this has worked really well for Catalunha - Spain *could* enact a law to allow them to legally secede, but isn't going to - and I don't see why Scotland would either. And again you're evading the question: if there's no legal means of secession, do you agree these constituencies will be denied their right to self determination in your scenario, yes or no?

&gt; Are you trying to insert a bait and switch here by suggesting a legal mechanism that lets them break away unilaterally?

You're really spinning your wheels now. 

I never suggested they leave unilaterally, and I asked you if scotland has ever had, or plans to have a law that allows its constituencies to secede legally in your scenario (ie: by referendum) - so answer the question: yes or no?",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/ey7rpi/independent_scotland_will_need_more_than_empathy/fggq6vh/,GenericsMotors,1580767133

4356,"&gt;Perhaps you should look up what an ad-hominem is; or perhaps you already know but think that ""goal-post mover"" is some major offence. It's a fact: you've done nothing but shift your argument somewhere else as soon as it doesn't work.

An ad hominem is an attack against the person's character, not their argument. And I asked you a specific question first, and you've done everything that you can to try and hijack the frames of the discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Again with the assumption that they can just make their own secession movement! Conveniently ignoring our other thread where I asked you what would happen if Scotland provides no means of legally breaking away! (ie: such a movement would be sedition).

What would stop the Scots in those specific constituencies from starting a secession movement? Are you trying to imply some sort of unilateral declaration?

&gt;Because I don't believe (and you have it from a Scotish nationalist in this thread!) that those constituencies will ever be given the right to leave after an independence referendum. You claim that they will be able to - so back that up.

No, I said that they should be given the right to pursue a secession movement. I didn't say that they will, and it's irrelevant what you personally believe, because that's just an uninformed opinion. There's no evidence to support either way.

4409,"&gt;The American dream is, at its most basic level, the idea that everyone should ~~be given~~ **take** the opportunity to reach their life's goals and ambitions.

The American dream is not about being *given* anything by anyone. You cannot give people their life's goals and ambitions without forcing other people to be responsible for offering them (in turn diminishing the other person's capacity to do as they will). That's precisely why Americans are so sceptical of large state projects - they necessitate the offsetting of their *individual* ambitions for collective, national ones, that they may not agree with. This is compounded by their history of immigration and cultural disparities.

America is a highly individualistic country that has historically managed to establish community through a deep religious conviction and sense of judgement from God, i.e. you support people not through forced state taxation to fund welfare but through voluntary acts of kindness and charity that demonstrate your moral character and worth to God. America has some of the lowest welfare systems in the world but frequently gives the most to charity per capita of anywhere.

I'm not saying it's a good system or that it's right or ""best"" but it's what they do, it's what they are and it's what they have been for a long time.

And it's all well and good saying this sort of stuff in Finland when you're a small, highly ethnically homogeneous country. Finland achieves a more balanced society precisely because it has less lines of division by which to separate it. It has a greater affinity for welfare directly because it has a strongly and more definable set of people living there who have a more familial sense of cohesion, support and culture.

As a Brit I am conflicted on such things, like many of us are, because just as in geography so too in mentality we find ourselves between America and Europe on questions of welfare and individuality/nationality.",Scotland (Anglo-froggish),/r/europe/comments/eyaksx/finlands_prime_minister_said_nordic_countries_do/fggd9ol/,Whoscapes,1580759440

I  agree it was only cited as the top 2-3 reasons for voting by 12%  (leavers) and 15% (remain) but it's not so much mythical status. It was  stated by the Tories and the [No campaign Better Together](https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584?lang=en) as a key benefit of voting no.

4474,"&gt; SCOTLAND’S deficit has grown to almost seven times the relative size of the UK’s, according to new data from the Scottish Government.

&gt; SNP ministers were accused of trying to “bury bad news” by failing to publicise the change.

&gt; The Sunday Times reported the shift was contained in the latest GDP quarterly national accounts for Scotland, which showed the difference between and tax income and public spending had risen from 7 per cent to 7.2% of GDP.

&gt; Although the deficit stayed roughly the same at £12.6billion, a 3% drop in the size of the Scottish economy from £180bn to £175bn meant it grew in percentage terms.

&gt; The change was largely down to a sluggish growth and a revision in North Sea oil and gas revenues.

&gt; The UK deficit is 1.1% of GDP.

&gt; Although the deficit reflects Scotland’s current position within the Union, it is a key issue in the debate over independence.

&gt; While the SNP say independence could help reduce it, Unionists say it shows Scotland would need to slash services, hike taxes or go on a borrowing binge after a Yes vote.

&gt; The deficit is also critical to Nicola Sturgeon’s plan for an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU, as it would need to come down to 3% for Scotland to qualify.

&gt; Economist John McLaren of Scottish Trends, who obtained the new figures, said: “The lack of analysis by ministers of the important revisions to Scottish economic data is worrying, if not entirely unexpected.

&gt; “A £5bn downwards revision in Scottish GDP has important implications for judging Scotland’s economic and fiscal standing, especially in terms of independence or full fiscal autonomy.”

&gt; Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: “The SNP have been caught red-handed trying to sweep their economic failures under the rug.

&gt; “The SNP’s secret Scotland must end now. The Scottish Conservatives are calling on SNP Ministers to explain themselves to the Scottish Parliament this week.”

&gt; Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton tweeted: “Scotland’s national deficit is now 7.2% and rising.

&gt; “Applicant states are required to have a deficit no higher than 3% before they’ll be considered for EU membership.

&gt; “We could be outside both unions for years. Independence not the EU lifeboat SNP say it is.”

&gt; Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “Nicola Sturgeon views Brexit as a political opportunity to talk up the break-up of the UK, while trying to hide the economic reality from people.

&gt; “As part of the UK, we pool and share resources so that this deficit doesn’t lead to deeper public service cuts or steep tax rises.

&gt; “That wouldn’t be the case with a separate Scotland, and Nicola Sturgeon needs to start being honest with voters.”

&gt; The Scottish Government said that although total GDP had been revised down £5bn overall, onshore GDP - the part of the economy which excludes the North Sea - had risen by £185m in 12 months.",,/r/europe/comments/eyaoh9/snp_ministers_accused_of_secrecy_as_scots_economy/fgg0ow2/,quixotic_cynic,1580751713

4478,"There is rape, violence and sex in every media everywhere and comics/animation are both medias and arts. The problem I think is that Disney made us think that animation was only for children, so when we first saw japanese animation and didn't know they were often adaptations of comics for young adults, we thought they were showing these programs to kids.

All the violent and fetish anime are late night anime in Japan. They air it only when kids are asleep. And when it comes with their R-18  productions, well you know how anime and manga characters looks like, there's no way like such characters can be assimilated to realistic humans anyways. 

Japan allows a lot of really extreme fetishes to be depicted in their comics and cartoons, but then their crime and violence rates are among the lowest in the world, and for having been living in Japan for 18 years, I can guarantee you that there isn't any country as safe, especially for a woman walking alone in the middle of the night, anywhere. So maybe that thesis about the extreme contents of such medias having a cathartic effect on people is true. Like violent video games can help evacuate the stress. I don't know. America's medias are full of rape, violence and drugs but it doesn't seem to have any cathartic effect on people, I mean, judging by the crime rates?

Same for Japan's religions, Shintoism and Buddhism, they don't strangle people. Don't limit them, and Japanese people can switch from Buddhism to Shintoism and vice-versa according to what they want to celebrate. They are free. The only time when I've seen women discriminated was during a Sumo tournament, when I discovered that they couldn't enter the sacred fight area. But then they aren't forbidden to work or speak to other men for example, there is nothing religious that will really prevent them from living the same way a man would. So what still subsides might be old religion-based education problems. Women that men have to take in charge and dictate to whom they should marry etc, because in the past women were tools to get power and it was easy to use religion to advocate that. Like everywhere in the world, in fact. I always thought that religions were only the same books in different languages, and it's so true in so many cases. It's always roughly the same story, and women are always the ideal tools to use (and abuse).

Good thing that Japanese women were able to break free, and interesting when you know that strikes are illegal here. You know I'm French and when I see all these endless strikes and protests that end in nothing and are only weakening the country's economy and fueling people's anger in France, I'm happy to know there are other countries that found a way to get better and better while avoiding such chaos.",,/r/europe/comments/exvq77/meanwhile_in_russia_novosibirsk_they_are_laying/fgg0uqr/,AdorableLime,1580751811
4479,"&gt; So, in essence, you support letting the costly, unprofitable component of the system remain public while giving exclusivity of use to private actors for them to generate profit off of?

The contract can easily be written to give the profits to the state and the company only gets paid a fixed amount. It's the case in some regional Czech franchises for example.

4482,"&gt;They knew very well a Brexit-vote was on its way

Actually that wasn't the case, a Brexit vote at that time wasn't that likely, the SNP were given permission for the referendum in 2012 and Cameron only promised the Brexit vote in the 2015 election as a sop to the anti-EU section of the Tories. Indeed, part of the campaign against the leave vote in Scotland was that staying in the UK meant staying in the EU (at the time, Spain was likely to veto any application to join to discourage Catalan separatists, though this is unlikely now). The arguement is thus that as Scotland voted to remain, being taken out of the EU against their will is such a big change they should be able to have a second vote so they can then apply to join the EU as soon as possible after independence (probably 2-3 years after the split). I think if Scotland was polling consistently say 55% for leaving the UK then there is an argument for the vote (just as NI must hold a reunification vote, by law, if reunification is likely to win)",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ey7rpi/independent_scotland_will_need_more_than_empathy/fgg0wh1/,Tuarangi,1580751840

4504,"&gt;Ladies and gentlemen,  
&gt;  
&gt;What does this draft negotiation mandate say?  
&gt;  
&gt;Let me briefly present its three main chapters, relating to:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;   Our economic partnership,  
&gt;  
&gt;   Our security partnership,  
&gt;  
&gt;   The institutional framework and governance of our future partnership.  
&gt;  
&gt;Firstly, on our economic partnership:  
&gt;  
&gt;We are ready to offer a highly ambitious trade deal as the central pillar of this partnership, including:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;      Zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods entering our single market of 450 million people.  
&gt;  
&gt;      An ambitious free trade agreement in services,with wide  sectoral coverage, ranging from business services to telecommunications  or environmental services;  
&gt;  
&gt;      We are also looking to include digital trade, intellectual  property and access to our respective public procurement markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are ready to offer all this, even though we know that there will  be strong competition between the UK – our immediate neighbour – and the  EU in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;Competition is normal.  
&gt;  
&gt;But, because of our geographical proximity and economic  inter-dependence, our draft mandate also makes clear that this  exceptional offer is conditional on at least two things:  
&gt;  
&gt;First, we need to make sure competition is – and remains – open and fair.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;      We have already agreed with Prime Minister Johnson that our  future partnership will prevent ‘unfair competitive advantages'.  
&gt;  
&gt;      We must now agree on specific and effective guarantees to ensure a level playing field over the long term.  
&gt;  
&gt;      That means mechanisms to uphold the high standards we have on  social, environmental, climate, tax and state aid matters, today and in  their future developments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, our free trade agreement must include an agreement on fisheries.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;      This agreement should provide for continued reciprocal access to markets, and to waters, with stable quota shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we can agree on this, as well as on robust commitments towards a  level playing field and the necessary enforcement mechanisms, we will  achieve a very ambitious free and fair trade agreement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ladies and gentlemen,  
&gt;  
&gt;It is important, however, to understand that, even if we do achieve  such a ‘best-in-class' free trade agreement, it will not be ‘business as  usual'.  
&gt;  
&gt;We will have two separate markets instead of one single market:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;      Rules of origin and customs formalities will apply between the UK and the EU;  
&gt;  
&gt;      Access to the EU market will be subject to certification and market authorisation and supervision activities;  
&gt;  
&gt;      There will be no harmonisation or mutual recognition of rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;      This means, for example, that UK financial services suppliers  will no longer have the passporting rights they used to enjoy under  Union legislation.  
&gt;  
&gt;All imports of goods, or services supplied in the EU will need to  comply with EU rules, be iton safety, health or other standards  protecting our public policy objectives.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a result, goods entering the Union will, for example, be subject to regulatory checks.  
&gt;  
&gt;These are the automatic, mechanical consequences of the UK's choices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Businesses must adapt now to this new reality.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, where our rules converge – either because the UK chooses  to match our standards or, for example, where activities are subject to  international regulations that we share – it will be easier for  businesses to exchange between both sides of the Channel.  
&gt;  
&gt;As President von der Leyen said in London last month, the more we  will have common standards, the higher-quality access the EU will be  able to offer to its market.  
&gt;  
&gt;But this will be up to the UK to decide:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;      Will it continue to adhere to Europe's societal and regulatory model in the future,  
&gt;  
&gt;      or will it seek to diverge?  
&gt;  
&gt;The UK's answer to this question will be fundamental for the level of ambition of our future relationship.  
&gt;  
&gt;The UK must know this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ladies and gentlemen,  
&gt;  
&gt;We also want our economic partnership to cover many other areas, such as the mobility of people, or transport.  
&gt;  
&gt;We will also consider how the UK could continue to participate in EU programmes such as Horizon Europe or Erasmus.  
&gt;  
&gt;For this, the EU first needs clarity on its own Multiannual Financial Framework beyond 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, the EU will consider whether our economic partnership would  be accompanied by equivalences of financial services or adequacy of the  UK data protection regime.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;      These will be unilateral decisions of the EU. They are not part of the draft mandate.  
&gt;  
&gt;      However, they are relevant for the overall future relationship and need to be considered in that light.  
&gt;  
&gt;      We will start the assessment work in those areas immediately.

4569,"&gt;So they earn less regardless.

Not because of their sex. Because they decided to work in a tax-funded sector. No-one is forcing them to work there and men also work there. Sweden have strong unions and I don't think any union would be ok with lower wages for women.

&gt; Nice strawman. 

It's not a straw man argument. It's very common among those idiots to argue that different salaries for different jobs and even different amount of work us unfair too. But all work isn't equally much worth. As such the salary shouldn't be either. I brought up the brushes because I know at one place where this one person with a lower capacity in the labour market actually are doing brushes by hand. But of course that persons productivity is much lower than that of a machine and we don't really need manual brush makers. In Sweden last year the amount of immigrants who had got a job within three(?) months of ending their establishment period had dropped from 38% to 31% and that was mostly because the subventioned jobs they got before had lowered in volume. It's clearly jobs for which there at-least may not be a market demand to hire them to provide their service for that salary but where they get the job anyway because the state decide that for whatever reason they should get a job and an income and do that thing anyway. I write ""may not be"" because of course there could also be jobs where they actually could have hired and pay someone to make that job but now they didn't had too because the state does it instead so they don't.

It is jobs but they aren't competitive and not worth the money (else the free market would had done it.)

&gt; lol 

Not an argument and even if it was it would be wrong.

&gt; Of course it sucks, if you're alienated from your labor under capitalism. 

Uncomprehensible for me.

&gt; Who is arguing against that? 

Socialists. Those who work more work and work opportunities as a good thing. Just as with this inefficient Russian crap above.

Sweden shut down one nuclear reactor this year switch and will do it again the next one. At the same for instance a very large wind farm is made in northern Sweden which won't provide as much energy but still a large amount of energy but the fact is that the nuclear plant already existed and was in good condition whereas the wind farm have to be freshly produced. On median nuclear plants and wind farms have the same CO2 footprint / kWh produced but as we are comparing and already existing nuclear plant vs a new wind farm the CO2 output may actually be higher for the wind power produced too. So money is wasted onto something which may also have a larger climate impact. Someone, likely also socialist / left-wing, argued that it didn't mattered that the wind farm cost a lot of money because the state wouldn't pay for it anyway. Personally I don't care who pay for it. Those who use the energy will pay for it. And those are the people of Sweden, who also happen to be the people who are paying the taxes. Regardless of whatever you waste people's resources and productivity through taxes or not it happened. Similarly I don't cheer for lower state debt and higher private debt, just as higher state debt combined with lower taxes wouldn't really be much of a success story either.

Some people in economy are definitely arguing that war is good for the economy even though it's just destructive and waste resources which could had been used onto improving things instead.

Some people actually think ""it creates more jobs!"" is a good thing even if that job is only done to fix what was destroyed before.

&amp;#x200B;

Plenty of things in Sweden are socialist. The nuclear power plant in this case is owned by the state owned company Vattenfall. So who are the owner and decide what should be done with this nuclear plant in this case? The state of course.  


Who are deciding that immigrants should get ""simple jobs"" with a decent salary to work at a non-profit organization? The state.

The labour market in general in Sweden isn't controlled by the parlament though but rather by the market between employeers and the unions but with almost half of the GDP going into taxes and a massive publically funded sector and with tax deductions for work done in your home and with subventioned salaries for people who are deemed to be far from a job on the markets terms there are definitely exceptions. Also beyond policians powers with such a large welfare sectore there's of course some ideologically and politically driven people who will act according to their beliefs rather than according to the law, parlament or interest of the tax payers or citizens of Sweden.",,/r/europe/comments/exvq77/meanwhile_in_russia_novosibirsk_they_are_laying/fgfp64u/,aliquise,1580744453

There typically only is one truth. Even in quantum physics I assume the truth is a function capable of covering multiple answers.

The point is that ""following the law"" isn't a guarantee for success. It completely depends on what the law is. The law can be garbage. It could be good to break the law. Say if the law said women only deserved half the salary of a man would it then be good to follow it? The law isn't necessarily just or right. Well.. back to the religious case the believers may argue their law from their god is exactly that because god. But that's rather a problem in itself than a solution to the issue.

I mean, that also means that there are other places that pay male staff better, but then it's not like it's new. Or even an asian thing.

4636,"&gt;Yep, and it turned out it was unacceptable to the parliament because it kept the entire UK in the backstop until the EU decided it could leave, the UK would be the only country in the SM/CU that couldn't unilaterally leave. Would it have came to that if the EU hadn't been so hardline with the earlier suggestions? The UK could currently be out of the EU but following most of it's regulations.

That was May's Government's idea however ! The EU was fine with the agreement with Boris Johnson, it never truly cared except for there being no hard border.

It's why I don't understand some British users trumping it as a win they got the EU to budge, if anything it seems a victory of Remainers against Brexiteers or Brexiteers versus Remainers because it made the general British public accept a deal that it had first called an attempt to tear apart their country.

Of course it had to be hardline, and I'll explain why in the next paragraph.

\&gt; As the EU's were to the UK, it was the EU asking for a huge compromise  of British sovereignty and unity with Northern Ireland, yet unwilling to  compromise itself.  

When Prime Minister Cameron went to Brussels to make three demands he got two easily, except the last one which was about the Common Market and Right to movement.

The EU does compromise, but it will refuse in the case for the right of movement. It would other things, but not that. It wouldn't give Cameron everything he wanted to keep the UK as a member, it certainly wouldn't give it just to ease up a trade agreement with the UK.

That's the hardline, to not stay in generalities. It was a consensus of 27 nations that this is one issue they would not budget on, because they have more to lose by accepting than losing the UK as a trading partner altogether.

If you want to debate the validity of movement in the EU I'm willing, I've had to say it to gsurfer as well.

\&gt; These should have never been banned, the GFA makes it clear negotiations  should be between the UK and ROI. Again, there's good reasons it wasn't  like that, but you can't claim to be following the GFA when you've  declared the negotiation rules within the GFA must not be followed. 

The UK were allowed and did have talks with the Republic of Ireland, in accordance with the GFA.

It was the Republic of Ireland which called for EU support several times and got it. They were never banned, it was just that out of the 27 nations of the EU none were swayed.

\_\_\_\_\_

It's slightly off-topic, but I just don't get one thing of the bilateral strategy of the UK. The Germans have always been about the economy and having a deal with the UK and it was the French Government who were about having a small and politically oriented EU, while the Irish Government would never accept leaving the EU for the UK, they like having the added weight versus their neighbor.

So why did the (May Government to be fair) decide to deride Germany, try to appeal to France and pressure Ireland with this ""stronger together"" rhetoric?

\&gt; Everyone seemed so sure there would be no nationalist violence. However  whether violence would have returned or if policy dictated by threat of  terrorism is a good thing are different discussions. 

It seemed to me there was a lot of worry about it. Even Brexiteer politicians and even users around here preemptively started saying they wouldn't be responsible if terrorists started their attacks again.

Whether it's valid or not to have politics dictated by terror  is another discussion, you're right, but it seems that many were worried of further violence.

\&gt; And  I'm saying that if trade was discussed the border and money discussions  would have gone a lot better, if the EU was worried that the UK would  try to shirk them, which I doubt as the arguments against were always  ""what are we getting in return?"" then fall back on the old saying,  ""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed""

And I'm saying that there was a genuine fear it would never be addressed if it wasn't solved, that there would be too strong a temptation to leave one issue in limbo. 

Michael Gove, a British official outright said they should not honour any agreement, I hope you understand how bankrupt the UK was of any kind of trust. Perhaps if there was more trust it would have gone more smoothly, but there wasn't.

It wasn't just a negotiation strategy as you may think.

\&gt; As it is for you to imply the UK didn't compromise or respect the GFA,  I'm saying it would have compromised more if the things the UK wanted  were up for discussion. If the EU had discussed trade along with  withdrawal and proposed more than one solution to the border 

What did the UK want, apart negotiating trade as early as possible? At least in your opinion? 

There were two solutions for the border, and both had been rejected multiple times, and the idea of a ""technological"" solution was not ready to be implemented and viewed with skepticism. 

\&gt;then we  probably wouldn't have a government filled with hard Brexiteers right  now. 

It seems to me the current one is less hard-line, or at least there's the same faces as under Theresa May. The only difference is it now has the majority to not be as chaotic, because both Brexiteers and Remainers are tired of this mess.

If the UK had also acted differently it may still have some of the influence and credit it had accumulated in the EU the past few decades, instead of burning it all away to make a show for their electorate.

The British are different to the French, or the Nordic countries, in that while people here will also say they want to buy British, they won't pay a penny more to actually do it, so they end up buying British only in areas where it's cheaper anyway (like Beef, because people in other EU countries don't trust British beef)

They added that if work conditions were better and wages were higher, more of them would work at the bread factory and the owners wouldn’t have to hire foreigners.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The mayor of Ditrau, who moderated the meeting, said the high school in his village has a dual education class that trains bakers and that they should be hired in the area. He also said the City hall would get involved to make sure this happens. **He added that Ditrau has got much bad publicity because of this situation, which he believes was not caused by the workers from Sri Lanka** **but by the bakery owner’s behavior.**

I am one of those guys who you see on the side of the road. The hours are long, hard, dangerous, in all weathers, night work, alongside idiot drivers who dont understand they are driving ballistic missles whilst on the phone or using 'lane assist' that doesnt spot traffic cones. 

The jobs are often miles from home, the projects long and logistically a nightmare at the best of times.

Those guys and gals smoking a fag in and around their holes, or in the carriageway, or working on gantries, road laying, tarmacing, surveying etc etc are having their break mate, or working out how to get around some unforeseen element you cant see as you flash past in you sealed unit on wheels. But they dont get to heave out to the canteen where they can sit on their arse in dry warm comfort for their mandated 40mins spending all of that on their phones. No, they are pushing out an 11 hour day, with more hours through the night just to get that road reopened ready for you to drive by them again in the morning, the same guys from the night before, but they aint gone home like you.

Brexit and the impact on supply lines seems to be a concern as does the possibility of tariffs between the EU and UK. 

However, reading between the lines, a big influence seems to be the collapse in the diesel market - where it seems a lot of the components and parts for diesel engines are sourced from the EU and brought to the UK. At least for Nissan. It's the free flow of cars parts that seems to be a bigger concern, than potential tariffs barriers on the end product. 

Hard to say, but it seems there's a possible move towards focusing their electric vehicle production in the UK.

4940,"It's only a strawman if it's artificially constructed. Westerners who do not have to live with the daily impacts of communist rule are far from artificial.

Oligarchs in the former Eastern Block aren't some new players who only appeared on the scene after our revolutions. They are most commonly people who had ties and contacts in the previous regime that they used to steal as much property and money as possible in the early 90s clusterfuck that was all of our economies. Fuck, our oligarch prime minister was a fucking secret police agent during the communist era. Putin was a KGB operative.

It may seem like we are blaming things on times long gone, but this couldn't be farther from truth. When it comes to the stuff ""higher up"", ex-communist officials are still trying to cling onto power in every sector from law enforcement to the private sector. Lower down, the mentality of ""Not stealing from work is stealing from your family"" and similar commonly accepted mindsets from the past regime are still present with some people, although I do believe this is way more common in the countries farther in the east that were under direct Soviet control. What Czechia primarily deals with are the problems that are higher up.

Just because there is a problem that is capitalistic in nature doesn't change the fact that it was directly caused by communism and therefore is a product of it. Western Europe doesn't see as nearly as many of these as the former Eastern Bloc. 

Also, I might be an asshole for saying this, but people who had the privilege of living a hemisphere away from the Soviet Union should probably not run their mouth about how ""not bad"" it was.

Independence is a precondition for a neutral judiciary (one that doesn't rule arbitrarily in favor of the government) but it does not by itself ensure neutrality.

But yes keep worrying about the country that never had a dictatorship and don't worry about the country that actually had a dictatorship for 35 years.

The real reason why we are even discussing this is because these changes are not convenient for EU member countries, while other events like the ones in Spain don't really affect EU members.

Otherwise no trade negotiations would take place at all. And a *permanent* no-deal-at-all scenario was not suggested by anyone. 

To put it differently: ""Hard"" versus ""soft"" Brexit are terms describing the nature of the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Will they be closely aligned or not so closely? In contrast to this, the withdrawal agreement was just about leaving the EU in an orderly fashion and not about the future relationship (with some exceptions). The latter is going to be negotiated this year. And at the end we will know how ""hard"" or ""soft"" Brexit will be.

At the moment things look as if the result will be the hardest Brexit possible, i.e. just an FTA.

As far as I understand all laws passed by the EU only become legally binding once they are ratified (published) as law in each country. The agreement simply ensures that for many areas this is done pretty automatically in certain time periods.

The only polish law that could impede the government of making these changes is the constitution since that one supersedes any law passed by the parliament.

5068,"When Leave won the EU referendum, Dominic Cummings, the mastermind of the victory, celebrated by mounting a table and punching a tile from the ceiling of his campaign war room.

When Brexit itself happened on Friday night, Cummings responded not with cheers but tears.

At a party in 10 Downing Street, as the 11pm deadline passed, the assistant to the prime minister and the most feared man in government took to the microphone wearing tracksuit bottoms and black trainers and was lost for words as emotion overcame him.

The man once branded “a career psychopath” by David Cameron, clutched a hand across his face and sought to compose himself. Eventually, he managed to say: “Lots of people in this room know what happened. Thank you.”

A colleague compared Cummings to another fearsome character, this time from the world of film: “It was like that scene at the end of The Terminator 2 when Arnold Schwarzenegger says, ‘I know now why you cry . . .’”

Moments earlier Boris Johnson had praised Cummings for devising the two key slogans that helped win the referendum and the 2019 general election.

“It was he, I seem to remember, who came up with the famous phrase that we should ‘take back control’,” Johnson said. “It was also Dom that came up with the other three-word epigram, that the policy of the government should be to ‘get Brexit done’. And I want you to remember that you were here tonight, after 11 o’clock, when finally, we got Brexit done.”

Johnson had ushered in Brexit with a countdown to 11pm, energetically banging a small gong — in what supporters saw as an attempt to replace the silent bongs of Big Ben. He told aides, ministers and officials: “We took back control tonight. I want you to know that this is a fantastic moment in the life of our country. There are very few moments in our lives which really can be called an historic turning point — and this is it.”",,/r/europe/comments/ey28mq/boris_johnson_advisor_dominic_cummings_weeps_as/fgesje3/,casualphilosopher1,1580708473

5073,"Europe's median age is getting older because less people are being born and everyone is trying to fight it because... ?

Is it not natural for a population to stabilize at one point or another? Did we expect to see infinite population growth in a world that's already pretty overpopulated? 

Sure, it will cause some economic trouble down the line, mainly in the pension paying department. What i don't get is, why are young people the ones who should be paying for pensions other than their own? Surely after working for 50 years, old people have given enough money to the government to have it saved for their pensions right? 

It seems to me that it's not the whole world that has an aging problem affecting our economies, rather our economic models have a problem with our natural population stabilization. I think it's the economy that has to adapt, not the population, much like the European economy adapted to life post the black plague, bringing many benefits to the lower classes, such as more power, better pay, better work conditions and fairer treatment.

I don't think we should artificially inflate our numbers with migrants either. I'm certainly not against migration, but just getting as many migrants as possible in Europe just to follow a flawed economic model spells disaster for me.

5095,"Socialists in Sweden are the same.

To begin with we have the: ""Women earn less! It's unfair!"" - no, it's not. One part of the reason women may earn less is that many of them work with publicly funded care of people and as in reality the politicians may want to do other things than paying them a high salary so that didn't happened. But it's of course the same for men who choose the same work area. So in part you could say it's due to how they vote and that they vote for publicly funded welfare but more importantly it's of course about what kind of education you get, what kind of work you work and how long and often you work and how productive and much worth that end up being. As women take (generally) greater responsibility for children, skip work more often, work less hours and so on they earn less even if at the same job but that's appropriate and it would be the same for a man (or an immigrant) doing the same choices. And then there's the people who feel that there should be ""equal work - equal pay"" but they never mean EQUAL WORK they mean ""work"" or ""hours worked"", but of course all work isn'y equally much worth. Tying brushes by hand or getting an education in whining-due-to-sex-statistics or being an immigration activist or something such isn't very productive and of course you shouldn't be paid a lot, maybe you should even have to pay for the damage you're causing society. Salaries are a great way to making people do the right thing instead.  
Of course Sweden with its high progressive taxes and flat salaries isn't great at the later and here half of those who get a university degree won't earn more money than those who don't because 1) it may not be very useful but mostly 2) the little more they get to keep won't be enough to compensate for the money they didn't earn while studying.  


Anyways the real problem is the socialists who actually think ""work"" is a good thing and that more people working by itself or having more work to do is good ""because then there's work!"" - No. Work suck. Having to work suck. What you want is as high production as possibly with as little work as possible. Then you can still have it good with little work. People setting cars onto fire or shutting down nuclear reactors to build wind mill farms instead are just a waste of resources and doesn't make things better only worse because you could had done something productive instead of just getting back to where you already was.  


One example of this ""more work is better"" mentality is my uncle who complains that nowadays with modern forest machinery so little work force is required in the forest and that's clearly bad because less people work with it. But of course productivity is likely about as high as before only with less people doing it and those people being free to do whatever else instead. It's good we don't have to spend hours trying to get food for the day. It's good a tractor can sort that out for us so easily.

5158," **Nissan has drawn up a plan to pull out of mainland Europe if Brexit leads to tariffs on car exports — but to double down on the UK, where the Japanese company believes it could sell one in five cars.**  

Two people involved in the discussions said the contingency plan, drawn up late last year, would see Nissan close its struggling Barcelona van facility and stop manufacturing in France.  Under the scenario, the Sunderland plant in the UK would be maintained as part of an audacious attempt to steal market share from other carmakers.  If carmakers that import to Britain such as Ford and Volkswagen face tariffs that make their cars more expensive, Nissan’s UK-made models would have a competitive edge, allowing the company to grow from 4 per cent of the market currently to as high as 20 per cent, according to the two people.

  The scenario is one of several that the carmaker developed to plan for post-Brexit tariffs. People familiar with the discussions cautioned that the contingency plan was drawn up before Makoto Uchida was installed as the new chief executive in December.  Both the EU and the UK are expected to lay out tough negotiating positions today ahead of trade talks next month. Brussels will insist that market access be directly linked to Britain’s willingness to align with the bloc’s regulations when it unveils its proposals, while the UK will reject the idea of accepting EU rules.  Nissan’s public position is that the UK plant would be threatened along with its European business if the UK fails to maintain tariff-free access to the EU.  “We deny such a contingency plan exists,” said a spokesman for Nissan Europe. “We’ve modelled every possible ramification of Brexit and the fact remains that our entire business both in the UK and in Europe is not sustainable in the event of WTO tariffs …We continue to urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.”  Nissan’s warnings have prompted fears that the company would eventually be forced to close its Sunderland production site if UK prime minister Boris Johnson fails to secure a deal with the EU.  But the Japanese carmaker has invested more than £4bn in the site, the largest in the UK with 6,000 workers, and is determined to keep the facility operational even at the expense of abandoning its exports-based model.

  The plant, which is Nissan’s most efficient outside Japan, already makes three of Nissan’s five core models — the Qashqai, the Juke and the electric Leaf.  Under Nissan’s tariff scenario, the Micra — a small car that shares a wheelbase with the Juke and is produced in a Renault plant in France — would be moved back to the UK. The company would also explore Sunderland producing the X-Trail, the largest of its models and one it previously planned to make in the UK.  The site is equipped to make up to 600,000 cars a year, but last year output fell by a fifth to 350,000, with 80 per cent of the vehicles exported. Under the scenario of selling only to the UK and growing sales, the plant could reach 400,000.  Its reliance on components imported from Europe — which would face tariffs under a hard Brexit — will also reduce as the brand winds down its use of diesel engines made by Renault. Nissan plans to eliminate the fuel source from its line-up from 2022.  The idea of abandoning the business in mainland Europe underscores how far Nissan’s fortunes have declined in the region, where sales fell 17 per cent to 567,000 vehicles last year and most operations are lossmaking due to a sharp decline in diesel demand.  Other carmakers have hinted at the possibility of growing in the UK after a hard Brexit with Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Peugeot owner PSA, promising in that situation to step up the company’s presence in the UK at its Ellesmere Port car plant in Cheshire.",,/r/europe/comments/ey2uet/nissan_to_pull_out_of_europe_and_move_all/fgevof3/,TheGreatPompey,1580711779

Which I find weird because US social give average 1500 $monthly to Germany’s 1300$, (Germany’s retirement  age is higher too). This is of course worse since US has 401k and many different personal accounts for retirement while from what I could see, almost 92% of Germans only have the state funded one

Why isn’t pension paid more in Germany? From my little math- it most Def gets in more per Capita than US. Germany also caps retirement benefit to 2300$ to 3900 US one ( all amounts in USD).  Not to mention SSA has 3.5T savings account untouched for retirement- which is the biggest in the world from from I could see.

From numbers alone- Germany seems to tax more, give less, and have more limit on retirement benefit than US- while having less 3rd party options like 401k, IRA.

My conclusion was that the only reason why they were doing that must be that they were paid hourly: Probably both the company and workers instead of receiving a fixed sum for the entire project.

5396,"None of the examples you listed are ""valuable wooden **cities**;"" and the districts which you are referring to are minuscule in comparison to Fatih.

The suggestion of actual, proper conservation on a scale so large carries with it costs that could halt the advancement of society. There is no variety of conservation policy I know of that could be successfully applied to Istanbul in the 40s with the aim of maintaining the 19th century environment; only degrees of compromises, all favoring development more than conservation. The government at the time clearly was wrong but it was not wrong on principle, only in the degree it was willing to destroy.

&gt; incomparably safer electric and gas alternatives

Neither of these were available in Turkey until the 80s and 90s for heating. And their introduction without economic incentive (when the country was too poor to build the infrastructure and import natural gas), solely to improve fire safety by bringing gas to Fatih's now hypothetically conserved patchwork streets would have been prohibitively costly and dangerous, on the scale I suggested above. The options were wood/coal stoves or coal-fired boilers, both risky for wooden houses whose owners seldom had the means to improve or maintain them safely.

And I remain unconvinced that this was the primary cause. Europe had been gradually moving away from wooden housing for quite a while by then. London didn't turn brownish red for no reason.

Selective conservation (in a subset of Fatih) wouldn't have reached the broader goal either. The conserved areas would have gentrified (which has happened elsewhere, including in your examples), been renovated to appeal to touristic or middle/upper-class sensibilities and lost all of their cultural heritage which is supposed to be carried on by its inhabitants. Only the shell, which commenters here would call wonderful architecture, would have been preserved.

Regardless, we've moved the discussion to a different context. The parent commenter was suggesting that the lack of conservation was regressive.

https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-ditrau-bread-factory-workers-sri-lanka

&gt;The owner of a bread factory in the central Romania village of Ditrau, an area inhabited mainly by Hungarian ethnics, has decided to remove two Sri Lankans who worked as bakers in his factory after pressure from the local community, [Mediafax reported](https://www.mediafax.ro/social/peste-300-de-persoane-s-au-strans-la-caminul-cultural-din-ditrau-pentru-a-discuta-despre-problema-brutarilor-din-sri-lanka-primarul-a-plans-iar-patronul-si-a-cerut-scuze-de-la-localnici-foto-video-18775978/gallery-18776713/5).


&gt;The factory owner’s decision to hire two workers from Sri Lanka had sparked outrage in the village and more than 2,000 locals signed a petition calling for a referendum to stop what they called the “immigrant inflow”. The factory’s representatives initially asked the locals to be more understanding and kind and explained that the migrant workers had been hired legally because company couldn’t find local workforce

Skip over it all you want, it's true. You simply can't guarantee it. Especially with all the prosecuting coming from LGBT movement lately.

&gt;I wasn't talking about the human rights mentioned by the UDHR, I was talking about human rights as a broader concept. Not being persecuted for your identity and enjoying equal civil liberties are absolutely human rights.

No they're not. LGBT ideologists prosecute people all the time and infringe on their rights and liberties. 

&gt;I know this is non-sense because you can't actually provide any tangible examples.

Actually there is plenty of example of it, and it's connected to what I said above. 

For example, LGBT people love to go after persons who write anything they don't agree with on social media. I'm not talking about responding in the comments there, they find their employers, they find their family, make them lose their job and reputation. Simply because they said something they didn't agree with.

Right now LGBT movement does a lot of prosecuting, and I mean a lot. Go write on social media how you don't agree with children being transgender, and watch the shitstorm.

e.g. Would you support Scotland rejoining the EU

What could his response have been other than this? Any comment would have been politicised as would the lack of a comment. Why not be honest and positive?

It was also followed by

&gt;At the same time, I have to respect … I know how important the word “sovereignty”, “integrity”, was in the debate in the United Kingdom. I think it’s not my role to intervene in \[that\] despite my sympathy. If you ask me about legal circumstances, we have to be here very cautious. We have our own treaties.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Of course, you can always interpret treaties in very different ways. But if I understand well, the only justified interpretation is that if something like, you know, the independence of Scotland happens then we need a regular new process. There is no automaticity \[sic\]. New situation, new country. Then it means a new process.

There seems to be a mix of people (cunts) that seem to think that any expressions of mutual appreciation between Scotland and the EU must be banned now. This seems to be motivated by the English thinking it is a rebuke of them (trust me when I say we do not need subtext to rebuke the English), Spaniards or anti separatists in general hating it in case it applies to e.g. Catalonia (it doesn't), or others that for some demented reason think that the EU should shun Scotland for fear that it offend the rest of the UK (but given that offended is its default position, it would be like adding feathers to a peacock).",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/exp0bd/tusk_eu_would_be_enthusiastic_if_scotland_applied/fgd9vd0/,gmsteel,1580680264

5509,"&gt; Nah, Catalonia, once independent would have to apply to join the EU again. This was one of the reasons used to try to weaken the Catalonian independence movement.

I think you'll find that almost opposite is true: pro-independence politicians tried to _increase_ support to independence by trying to convince Catalans that **1)** winning the referendum result in independence, and **2)** that independence would not result in leaving the EU. At no point did the Spanish government or the main anti-independence political parties try to counter argument **2)**, for the basic reason that independence was simply _not going to happen_.

For instance, see this news from some months before the referendum, where [Oriol Junqueras ""guaranteed"" that it was impossible for Catalonia to be out of the EU following independence](https://www.diaridegirona.cat/catalunya/2017/05/26/junqueras-garanteix-impossible-catalunya-surti/848423.html) [_^Google ^Translate ^into ^English_](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.diaridegirona.cat%2Fcatalunya%2F2017%2F05%2F26%2Fjunqueras-garanteix-impossible-catalunya-surti%2F848423.html).

5578,"&gt; did you rebuild the cities or did you often build new buildings? 

As far as I know, bomb-damaged historical buildings were mostly rebuilt as they were, whereas building without artistic value were usuallt replaced by new buildings.

&gt; You mentioned Bologna but it doesn't seem like it was damaged a lot compared to Milano. 

Both cities were damaged pretty badly, although Milan was a bit more. According to the 1946 Treccani Encyclopedia, which drew on contemporary official reports, 22 % of buildings in Bologna were destroyed partially or totally, and another 21 % were damaged; in Milan, 38,7 % of all buildings were destroyed or badly damaged, and 21,5 % were lightly damaged. Bologna had, in fact, more victims than Milan; with 2,481 victims, it was the city with the highest civilian death toll in Northern Italy (precise numbers are lacking for Milan, but most estimates place the victims at about 2,200). Bologna also suffered the single heaviest bombing of any Italian city – the one on 12 October 1944, when 698 bombers dropped 1,293 tons of bombs (the second heaviest was the one suffered by Milan on 12 August 1943, when 478 bombers dropped 1,252 tons of bombs; a similar bomb tonnage was also dropped in the first raid on Rome, on 19 July 1943, and in the raid that destroyed the unfortunate town of Cassino in 1944).

&gt; Do/Did Italians hold a grudge for the bombings against the British and Americans?

Most young people are barely aware that it happened, I think. Old people, I cannot say. Neofascists of course use it to argue that the Allies were criminals, but they are a minority. 

&gt; Yeah they bombarded civilian areas for the same reasons in Germany but the British didn't make use of firebombs in Italy right? It's what absolutely devastated the German cities and robbed them of their thousand years of history.

Well, only four cities in Italy were subjected to indiscriminate ‘area bombing’ like in Germany: Milan, Turin, Genoa (the “industrial triangle”), and La Spezia (naval base) in 1942-1943. When bombing these cities, the RAF made ample use of incendiaries: for instance, in the 12/8/1943 raid on Milan which I mentioned, 582 tons of bombs (out of 1,252 overall) were incendiaries, with a staggering 380,000 incendiary devices dropped. Generally, between a third and half of the bomb tonnage dropped by the RAF in “area bombing” raids on these cities were incendiaries, and in some instances they were even more than half – such as Milan on 14 February 1943, with 166 tons of incendiaries as opposed to 110 tons of “explosive” bombs. However, Italian cities were far less vulnerable to firebombing than German ones, mainly for two reasons: a) far smaller use of wood in the buildings (old buildings in German city centers made ample use of wood in their structure, whereas in Italian cities bricks and stone were far more prevalent), and b) wider streets (which made it harder for the fires to spread from one side of the street to the other). The rest of the Italian cities I mentioned were never targeted with deliberate “area bombing” (although there are some possible exceptions in the spring-summer of 1943, such as some raids on Naples and Cagliari), but rather with strategic bombing aimed at factories, port facilities, marshalling yards and so on, which however was grossly inaccurate and resulted in large amounts of bombs falling all over the city, resulting in effective “coventration” (examples: Treviso, Foggia, Terni, Pescara, Ancona, and others I’ve mentioned). Little or no use of incendiaries was made in these raids (which were mostly done by the USAAF), the vast majority of the bombs were of the “explosive” type.

Im not talking about numbers but more the social/media attitudes towards those groups.Like what happend in birmingham protests or this girl.If roles were switched the reaction would be different.Muslims are treated with kid gloves in some issues.

&gt; I don’t see any future for Europe and the EU the way things are going. There is a lot of talk of European values but no politician seems worried about our declining demographics. No one dare make the unpopular conclusions. That the western way of living with cheap contraceptives and unrestricted right to abortion is incompatible with the very nature of mankind.
I dont think contraceptives and unrestricted rights to abortion has much to do with fertility rates.For example 

Finland fertility rate 2010 1.87,now 1.35

Norway fertility rate 2010 1.95,now 1.56

Did norway or finland not have contraceptives or rights to abortion 10 years ago?

&gt; In Israel they have resteicted rights to abortion. Married women are generally not allowed to abort, and this is enough to keep fertility rates above replacement levels. The EU needs a similair fertility policy, yet powers that be would never dare suggest such a thing. Despite the fact that continued Middle Eastern and African immigration is a recipe for disaster.

Where did you get that info about israel?

Previously, cases where the woman is between the ages of 20-33, and/or was granted an abortion due to the baby having been conceived under illegal circumstances or incest, the fetus had a serious physical or mental defect, the mother was unmarried, or the mother's health was in danger, the state pays for the abortion. **However, the law was modified in 2014 to allow a free state-funded ""health basket"" for any woman seeking an abortion.**",,/r/europe/comments/expcz2/french_elite_branded_cowards_for_deserting_girl/fgcii8a/,arnaoutelhs,1580672940

5789,"Just general knowledge. 

To have an advanced economy with millions of types of raw materials, components, high-end services, crossing the borders consinuously, you need to have good relations with the other advanced economies.

Like if you produce bicycles but some components that fit your product are not made in your country, say the battery, what you want is a range of countries where you can go shoppping for a cheap good battery that fits your product.

So it is a problem if you pissed of the country of the particuar company that makes the battery you need. It means you will have to go with a suboptimal choice. That makes your electrical bycicle worse than the bikes made in the countries that DO have access to all the markets. 

And the long run, it pushed you out of business if your product is not optimal. It's no good to have an electrical bike with all the components are really good - save the battery that sucks.

The only option to be both a bully and stay advanced is to try to make *everything* yourself. Only giants like China and USA even have a shot at that. And even then, it's hard.

I never accused you of a single thing, friend. My comment about reactionaries was quite obviously not directed at you, but maybe I hit a nerve. You're the one throwing serious accusations around.

Since, apparently, I need to explain this: concern trolling is when right-wing fuckjobs suddenly care about women's rights or gay liberation when it lets them score a bogus point against progressives who suggest not all Muslims are monsters (as an example). They don't believe the argument but use it anyway.

And I have certainly seen the same behaviour in the context of 'criticising Israel is anti-Semitic' from people who also believe in a big Jewish conspiracy when it suits them. I have also see it from extreme right-wing Israeli groups who should really know better than to play that card.

That's a romantic view of things. Mostly a painting craze. The Balkans during the Ottoman occupation were mostly a rural underdeveloped European area.

Over the years the State and local administrations have tried to sell as many as they could but many are just undesirable and costly, sure they will come up with foundations and dubious associations to put in them but it works only some times. Most of the celebratory organs, museums and offices are already in cool buildings if they want to.

You can only have so much decoration and over-celebration of the most mundane things before people stop caring about them. The example from Instanbul is probably similar: people would rather want a normal building in the city than a very ornate and costly space.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/exm9dp/restoration_failure_in_istanbul/fgaj9qb/,MrAlagos,1580651934
