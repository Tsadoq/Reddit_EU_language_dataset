4,"Poland's central government maintains three main categories of roads:  
\- autostrady, e.g. A2, A18 - motorways, or Autobahnen, speed limit of 140 kph  
\- drogi ekspresowe, e.g. S8, S86 - express roads, speed limit of 120 or 100 (dual or single carriageway)  
\- drogi krajowe, e.g 7 or 46 - national roads, or Bundesstraßen, speed limit of 100 or 90 (dual or single carriageway)

Autostrady must not have any level crossings, have widest lanes, emergency lanes,  most swoopy of corners, and least interchanges.

Drogi ekspresowe may have rare level crossings with traffic signals, can have a single carriage way, can be in built-up areas, can sometimes skip the emergency lane, but still only for cars, buses, lorries and motorcycles are allowed to use it.

Drogi krajowe is a catch-all category for main highways maintained by the central government, as opposed to voivodeships and gminas. There are still some technical requirements, mostly to allow heavy truck traffic and any feasible long distance travel.

22,"The modern concept of ""folk friendship"" stems from 3 significant periods in both Polish and Hungarian history: the 14th century, the 1848 revolutions and then the 20th century from the 2nd World War.   
In the Medieval Ages, beginning from the period of Mongol/Tatar invasions, where both countrie suffered greatly, while receiving little aid from the Holy Roman Empire or the merchant cities of the Italian Peninsula and Rome, Polish and Hungarian noble houses started intermarrying, sometimes to establish influence, to gain wealth, to preserve their families' power, etc. When the Árpád dynasty died out following the death of András III. in 1301 A.D., the Kingdom of Hungary suffered a devastating civil war, labeled by later historians the Interregnum (as in, between rule), where the control of the country was divided among powerful barons and minor dynasties swearing fealty to them. This period was ended when Caroberto from the House of Anjou (you might hear them mentioned as House of Plantagenets, House of Capeting  and House of Valois in different european regions and sources, their dynasty was an early powerhouse comparable to the later Habsburgs) won the claim for the crown and became king as Károly Róbert I., his subjects usually referring to him as Károly I. or Karl I..   
Caroberto, without a shadow of a doubt, saved the kingdom from becoming a vassal state to the HRE. He reorganized the code of rule on the base of ""honor"", promoting people based on their merits instead their heritage. He centralized financial authority to the crown by monopolizing mints and coinage. Today's Hungarian Forint, our national currency, stems all the way back when Caroberto introduced new coinage of ""Florint"" weighing the same in gold as a Venetian Ducat.  
He also was solely responsible for creating a united Eastern European sphere of influence when he invited the rulers of Czechia and the newly unified Poland to Visegrad (the castle is still standing [https://images.app.goo.gl/tTVjVTw3uZN5T21k7](https://images.app.goo.gl/tTVjVTw3uZN5T21k7)), where multiple agreements of trade and military cooperation were made. To further capitalize on his new allies's loyalty to achieve his final goal (becoming Holy Roman Emperor), he signed a treaty with Casimir III the Great, King of Poland, the last member of the Piast dinasty, to allow his Son, Louis, who was the nephew of Casimir III (remember the beginning part of noble houses interarrying?), to become King of Poland upon his death.   
After Casimir's and Caroberto's death, Louis became the sole ruler of both kingdoms for the period known as the Personal Union. For the Hungarians, this was the continuation of the stability Caroberto bought to the land, for Louis reigned with absolute control just as his father, but his legislation bought forth important legal documents, such as the pregoratives from the Diet of 1351 where he recognized all nobles equal under the rule of law, a uniform rent system for peasants and landowners and a new system of recruitment to amass his military force. In free royal citites he allowed city officials to appoint junior jurors to his new high court. In Poland he did the same, with his goal being enabling his daughter to succeed him on the throne. The  [Privilege of Koszyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_of_Koszyce) entails the many liberties of the polish noble houses.   
These historical achievements enabled his daughter, Jadwiga, to become ""King"" of Poland. She deserves her own post in r/History, but to make it very short: her marriage established the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, she kept the Teutonic order at bay until this new country could muster up the strength to KO one of the most fearsome military organizations at the time and become a dominant force of the region for centuries to come. But she was even better than that. She build hospitals, schools and commisioned many older ones to be restored, most importantly the University of Kraków which only existed for a short period under Casimir's rule due to a general lack of funds. She insisted prayers and hymns to be translated into Polish as a clear Eff-You to the Pope, promoting the spread of Polish language and literature across the land. So yeah, even in life Jadwiga was a Saint, so in death she actually became one! And she was a daughter of a Hungarian king. Who was born in Naples. 

This intermarrying continued on for centuries, for example in the 16th century Hungarian noble István Báthory became King of Poland. In the 1848 revolutions Polish military leaders flocked to the freshly drafted Hungarian National Guard and fought for Hungarian independence in the name of freedom and equality. 

Nothing could break down the trust between a Hungarian and the Poles. Even in WW2, when the sorrows caused by World War I manifested in a dictatorial fascist Hungarian state, that was discriminating Jews and actively assisted the Germans in their extermination, when Germany invaded Poland and Hitler demanded Hungary to assist him, he was denied on the basis of ""Hungarian Honor"". Hitler was also denied to transport troops thru' Hungary to surround the Polish army and destroy them. This allowed tens of thousands of Polish citizen to escape into neighboring Hungary and Romania and from then on to Syria to form the Polish Armed Forces in the West ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish\_Armed\_Forces\_in\_the\_West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces_in_the_West)).Later, when Hungarian troops were ordered to suppress the Revolution in Warsaw, they denied orders issued by Wehrmacht and SS officers to fight the Polish rebels. In fact the Hungarian HQ was in daily contact with the Polish Resistance, tipping them off where the Hungarians would perform ""mock attacks"" only to be ""ambushed"" by Polish resistance fighter, leaving huge amounts of weapons, ammunition and medical supplies after the ""reatreat from overwhelming forces"". Hungarian forces regularly allowed Polish fighters to pass through Hungarian controlled territory, while reporting the contrary to the Germans.   


Later when both countries came under Soviet rule, there was a great amount of solidarity between the two peoples, so all affairs happening in Poland had sympathy rallies in Hungary and vice-versa. During the 1956 revolution, when all other socialist countries rallied against Hungary, the Polish donated blood to save as many lives as they could, as best they could.",,/r/europe/comments/fnh99b/today_is_polishhungarian_friendsip_day_when_we/fl9n8vf/,ErhartJamin,1584963014

""The events in Hungary met with a very spontaneous reaction in [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Republic). Hungarian flags were displayed in many Polish towns and villages. After the Soviet invasion, the help given by the ordinary [Poles to Hungarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_and_Hungarian_brothers_be) took on a considerable scale. Citizen organizations were established throughout Poland to distribute aid to the Hungarian population. By 12 November, over 11,000 honorary blood donors had registered throughout Poland.

The original shipment was 101 thousand of face masks (not some 800k as I saw many Italians straight up lying in your racist thread on /r/Italy) and Czechs will send 110k of our own as the original shipment has already been distributed here.

So the morals that everyone should actually remember are:

There are also the factors of a lot of old people don't giving a F and going out even tho they are vulnerable.

The other factor is something you can get everywhere. Once they hospitals are overloaded, the death rate rises.

W/r/t the second paragraph, im a little confused. Yes the EU can ask for the Swiss to do something, abide by something, etc. etc., and yes the EU can even restrict their access to the EU’s market (I assume). But if the Swiss don’t want to make that deal with the EU, don’t have interest in becoming a member state and prefer to stay an individual nation-state outside of the federation AND the EU has not taken any of those steps such as limiting access then is this not the EU’s problem and not the Swiss’? 

Theoretically, it’s a design flaw of the EU that the EU should address (or take action regarding) not the result of Swiss exceptionalism. The Swiss are well within their rights to reject EU standards etc., and the EU could take action to change the nature of the relationship, but hasn’t, no? If that’s the case why place the blame on the Swiss for making an acceptable albeit exclusively self-interested choice when the EU has the power to rectify its situation for itself?

479,"Closing the borders is about whom you let in, not whom you let out of your country. Forbidding people to leave your country is what the communist regimes in Eastern Europe did. You can also see this in the current crisis. Where countries have closed the borders, it is about restricting who can come in, not about who can leave. And noone prevented Denmark from closing the border earlier or Sweden from having checks on their ferries.

I also doubt that Sweden got a single refugee more due to Merkel's policies. As I said, the vast majority of people was already in the Balkans, Italy and Greece when she made the decision, and other people were already on the way to Europe. Yes, there was probably a number of people who travelled to Europe just because of Merkel's policy. But Germany took in about 1,000,000 people. Out of these, about 800,000 were already on the way (in Europe or about to strom Italy and Greece). As Germany took in everybody until the borders were closed overall, there is no reason to assume that countries like Sweden got more refugees due to Germany's policy. If people decided to travel further North, it happened because of open borders to Denmark and Sweden, not because Germany was not willing to take them.

485,"i know 3 persons that have been tested yet( and a positive case, but that is just a friend of a friend).

 I remember that when some of the earlier deaths occurred it was reported that some had other underlying sicknesses. In general it is practice in Germany to fill out death reports in a way that list all medical conditions, i do not know why it should be different with the new outbreak.

I work in a hospital and right now the hospitals are not that overwhelmed YET, so  i believe the difference in deaths can be explained by the difference in testing number, because the number of people in severe conditions is also lower than in France, Spain etc.. If Germany would simply count the deaths different, the healthcare system would be under the same stress. And yes the capacities in Germany are larger and hospitals are better funded than in Spain or France, but not enough to explain the calmer situation here. Baden-Würtemberg and Saarland even took over responsibilities for patients from France. 

The number of infected people in Spain and France is very likely (much) higher than in Germany. Maybe even the UK? 

The US is also worth mentioning, at the beginning they had a very high Case-Fatality Ratio (CFR), now they managed to increase their testing numbers from almost non-present to one of the highest in the world ( 45.000 tests daily). The effect? the CFR dropped significantly. South Korea also has relativity few deaths per 1000 infections, they also did a lot of testing early on.

It is not a first-hand source, but i don't have time right now to search for the press conference. According to this article citing the RKI Germany does about 160.000 test weekly, what i have heard so far from other countries ( mostly speculations ) there are not that many tests performed.

601,"&gt;The ICC does not have the force of law in the USA. The ICC says it has jurisdiction to persecute Americans because the ICC decided it has that jurisdiction, not because there's any sort of law or agreement giving it that power. 

It doesn't have to have 'force of law' in the USA. Afghanistan has joined the ICC. In fact, most of the world is party to the ICC. The ICC is completely right in bringing any American war criminals that it can before the ICC. As you may or may not be aware, Americans aren't above the law of other countries.

&gt;The US didn't ratify any treaty accepting the legitimacy of the ICC, so from the perspective of the American government, any American who is being tried or imprisoned by it is functionally a hostage, not a convict. 

It doesn't matter what the American government says to justify protecting its war criminals.   

This is no different than a foreigner coming to the US, committing a crime such as mass murder, and being trialled by an American court. Would you defend them, arguing about how that person (or their country on behalf of them) never signed up to be trialled by an American court? I hope not. And certainly, I also doubt that you would suggest that the country which the criminal came from threatening the American judges and their families for convicting them should be treated lightly?

Same story. If an American war criminal travels to a country that has joined the ICC, that country is completely within their right to apprehend them and transfer them to the ICC.

&gt;You do something which is considered illegal by one country, and so that country freezes your assets until you stop it.

Correct, and I do hope that in turn our countries make use of the same right and sanction the US should they decide to sanction our judges and their families for carrying out the duty of upholding the law. These are extraordinary threats that are being directed at our citizens in an attempt to interfere in our legal systems. That cannot stand. If those American war criminals wish to be safe from prosecution by the ICC, then their only option is to never step foot into any of its members or countries that the members have extradition treaties with -- so, most of the world, really.

It seems like *some* Americans have a hard time grasping the fact that their laws have no relevance outside their own country or that countries that have joined the ICC can trial war criminals as they see fit -- with or without US approval.",,/r/europe/comments/fn3olh/us_secretary_of_state_threatens_families_of/fl8ay64/,iyoiiiiu,1584919599

I go to St. Olaf's, which is a non-denomaninational evangelical church but we gather in a historically Catholic church building. So we technically don't have priests or masses. We have active members in the hundreds. We're part of a [union](https://kogudused.ee/en/ekb-liit/) of 85 churches with ~6500 members. So it's overall a small number, but the churches are active (unpaid volunteers, etc) and don't exist just for the sake of tradition (there are some congregations that comprise of mostly young adults.) 

The struggling congregations probably get support from their larger denomination and the better-off churches. But sometimes pastors have separate full-time jobs as well. 

The Evangelican Lutheran church is the main denomination in Estonia, though, (167 congregations, ~20% of Estonia has membership) and at the church buildings get some government support for upkeep, seeing as how they're historical and cultural landmarks.

&gt; Near the end of World War I, servicemen from around the world returned home and spread what became known as the Spanish flu, whose symptoms included a raspy cough, severe headache, intense chills, thick brown spots on the cheeks, and a high fever. The Spanish flu was highly contagious, and the disease eventually killed somewhere between 20 and 50 million people worldwide, including 675,000 Americans—many more than World War I itself. The disease effectively shut down the United States, including the Beehive State. The Utah State Board of Health banned all public gatherings, beginning on October 11, 1918. Entire cities were quarantined. Beulah Leona Andrus, a Latter-day Saint in Ucon, Idaho, later described how Church meetings were canceled on Sundays: “I remember, too, during the flu epidemic of 1918, of our having Sacrament service in the home. I recall so well the lessons and the bearing of testimony.” Despite the efforts of the Board of Health, however, the Spanish flu spread in Utah, reaching 1,500 cases and 117 deaths in just four weeks, even after the ban on public meetings. On November 19, 1918, Joseph F. Smith, President of the Church, died of pneumonia, and because of the epidemic, no public funeral was held. Heber J. Grant was not sustained as President of the Church until June 1919, as April general conference was postponed because of the ban.
&gt;
&gt;The influenza epidemic of 1918 created a sense of urgency for Latter-day Saints to make the switch to individual sacrament cups. Members of local Relief Society, Mutual Improvement Association, and Primary organizations planned and executed all kinds of plays, dances, and other entertainments to raise funds for new individual sacrament sets. Among many examples were the young women of the Venice Ward in Sevier County, Utah, who performed a dramatic play for the community and held an ice cream sale to raise the necessary funds to purchase a new set of sacrament cups. Another indicator of the accelerated and widespread use of individual sacrament cups is the increase in advertisements for them in Church-owned magazines. Competing companies in and around Salt Lake City vied for space inside the front and back covers of the Relief Society Magazine, Improvement Era, and Juvenile Instructor. From Daynes Jewelry Company to the Deseret Sunday School Union Bookstore to the Information Bureau on Temple Square, each organization had its own unique design and selling points, including one that could empty and refill 144 cups at once. “Is your Ward Up-to-Date?” read one ad in the Juvenile Instructor. “All progressive Wards are buying,” another claimed. “Because it is Positively Sanitary,” declared another. These first individual cups were made of glass and metal, and while they were a much more sanitary means of partaking of the sacrament, it would be decades until disposable paper and plastic cups were produced.
&gt;
&gt;Although the type of sacrament cup used is a small procedural aspect of a rich and sacred ordinance, it is interesting to see adjustments in the administration of the ordinance over time....from sharing a goblet in the 19th century to using individual cups just before, and even more so after, the 1918 influenza epidemic. No longer do Church members need to worry about the floating red mustache in the sacrament cup or “the fumes of … tobacco in the water,” as George Q. Cannon put it. We can all take the sacrament with peace of mind, thinking of the Savior rather than worrying about who has brushed their teeth.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fn7c5s/dozens_use_the_same_spoon_during_holy_communion/fl8cb3l/,duisThias,1584920448

706,"To quote u/son_of_thorshamster
- I really liked his explanation:


""Scientists are struggling to understand why the death rate from the coronavirus is so much lower in Germany than other countries. Germany has seen just 52 deaths from the virus so far despite recording 18,361 infections — more than anywhere except China, Italy, Iran and Spain.

That represents a fatality rate of just 0.3 per cent, compared to 7.9 per cent in Italy — raising hopes Germany might be doing something right that other countries can follow.

The disparity has even led to allegations of a German cover-up by the Italian far-Right. But experts have cautioned that Germany may simply be at an earlier stage of the pandemic, and that death rates here may soon catch up.

But they also point to other factors that may be helping keep the German death rate down.

“Germany has had a very aggressive testing process,” Dr Mike Ryan, health emergencies director at the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. “So the number of tests maybe detecting more mild cases.

“From the beginning, we have very systematically called upon our doctors to test people,” Prof Lothar Wieler of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute said.

“We can provide testing to a high degree so that we can easily look into the beginnings of the epidemic.""

“Test, test, test” has become the WHO’s mantra in fighting the coronavirus, and experts say Germany’s vigorous testing programme may be doing more than just keeping the death rate down by documenting more cases.

“Italy has a much older population. And in many ways Italy is the poster child for living longer lives, but unfortunately in this case having an older population means the fatality rate may appear higher,” Dr Ryan said.

Official figures show that rates of infection among the most vulnerable age group, those aged 60 and above, are much lower in Germany than elsewhere.

That may just be a case of luck, but it may be that by identifying cases early, Germany has been able to track chains of infection and prevent the virus reaching the most vulnerable.

“There is a very big systemic difference between Germany and other countries,” Christian Drosten, the leading virologist at Berlin’s Charite teaching hospital, told Watson magazine.

“Our regulations for the introduction of new test procedures are very liberal. In other countries, there is a central authority that does all the testing for new diseases.”

By contrast, in Germany any doctor can perform a coronavirus test and public health insurance will pay. Germany is not the only country to record a lower death rate. In South Korea fatalities have also been much lower than the general trend.

“In South Korea it appears it was probably a combination of factors, rather than just one,” says Suerie Moon of the Graduate Institute in Geneva. “Initial cases were among the young, and focused around one church which made it easier for the authorities to contain. But it appears testing also played a crucial role.”

Other differences in the German health system may also be significant. The country has far more intensive care (ICU) beds than anywhere else in Europe.

Intensive care beds can mean the difference between life and death for those who become seriously ill with the virus, and dire reports from northern Italy have told of doctors being forced to choose which patients get them.

Germany has 28,000 ICU beds. By contrast, the UK has just 4,000. And 25,000 of Germany’s already have the ventilators seriously ill patients need.

At the outbreak of the crisis, Germany had 29.2 intensive care beds per 100,000 people. Italy had 12.5. The UK had just 6.6.

In part, that is because of the different way healthcare is funded in Germany. Public health insurance is compulsory and collected at source alongside income tax — but it is passed directly to insurance funds and never enters government coffers, effectively firewalling health funding.

Germany may be better prepared for the virus than most of its neighbours, but it may yet need all the beds it has. Authorities here have warned people not to be complacent about the death rate.

“This is just the beginning for Germany,” said Prof Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute. “If you imagine an epidemic like a curve, then there are countries that are simply further along it.” """,,/r/europe/comments/fn3843/italy_approaches_60000_cumulative_cases_as_it/fl7z2l7/,Wichtelmaenchen,1584912441

&gt;""Testing and identification of cases, tracing contacts, isolation, these are all measures that WHO proposes and recommends, and they were in place all the time,"" she said. ""And the social distancing is the second component that really also started relatively early.""

776,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian army on Sunday began flying medical help to Italy to help it battle the new coronavirus after receiving an order from President Vladimir Putin, a goodwill gesture that Moscow labelled “From Russia with Love”.

Giant Il-76 military planes began taking off from an airbase in the Moscow region after Putin spoke to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Saturday and agreements were later reached between respective defence ministers.

The Kremlin said Putin had expressed his support for Italy’s leaders and people in the extremely difficult situation they were facing and had heeded an Italian request for help.

Italy recorded almost 800 deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday, taking the toll in the world’s hardest-hit country to almost 5,000, out of over 53,000 reported infections.

“Giuseppe Conte expressed his sincere gratitude for the steps Russia is taking to support Italy at such a tough time for it,” the Kremlin said.

Moscow has tried to cultivate close ties with NATO and European Union member Italy in recent years. It asked Rome to help persuade the EU to lift sanctions imposed over Russia’s annexation of Ukraine from Crimea in 2014 - although those sanctions remain in place.

China, the origin of the outbreak, has also sent medical supplies to Italy, amid complaints from eurosceptic far-right leader Matteo Salvini that the European Union was failing in its duty of solidarity.

‘FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE’

TV footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry showed a column of at least seven military vehicles, including large trucks, waiting to be loaded onto planes.

The planes and trucks bore giant stickers showing heart-shaped Russian and Italian flags next to one another with the slogan ‘From Russia with Love’ in both Russian and Italian.

At least three planes took off on Sunday afternoon. The Ministry said they were bound for the Pratica di Mare military airbase, 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Rome.

The Kremlin said Russia was sending truck-based units capable of disinfecting vehicles, buildings and public spaces, as well as medical specialists and equipment, including testing devices, to the worst-hit Italian regions.

The team included some of Russia’s leading medical military specialists, who had first-hand experience of fighting outbreaks of African swine fever and anthrax and of developing vaccines against Ebola, it said.

The Defence Ministry said its help, being sent on nine military transport planes, would consist of eight medical brigades plus around 100 other personnel, including the epidemiological and virus experts.

Russia itself has reported 367 cases of the virus, many of them in Moscow, and one coronavirus-related death.",,/r/europe/comments/fn7rw0/from_russia_with_love_putin_sends_aid_to_italy_to/fl806ol/,bataneyelid,1584913119

843,"With all that being said, before this virus anyways, the only change to our way of life has been not paying a penalty for not having health insurance. Other than that, oil was 55 a barrel, I was employed, and the economy was doing pretty good.

Trump had no control over this virus. You can't blame the man for thinking the media is full of shit when they have berated him and spit in his face at every turn. The fact that everyone thinks they would have done so much better is crazy. There was no stopping this thing because China is the most corrupt country in the world. They destroyed evidence to make it seem like everything was fine and dandy.

Like I said I'm not a republican or a democrat, but I am tired of seeing all this shit talking. It does nothing for our country. Trump doesn't care that you talk shit about him. He's been in the shit talking business for years.

When all you do is bash the people on the other side, why would they ever want to work with you? Have you all forgotten that we need each side to see middle ground to make things happen in our country? All this anger is tasteless. Classless. Useless. From both sides. Trump is the president, not the king. Most things still have to go through congress to make it happen. He's not a puppet master. Fighting over who caused the problem isn't going to fix the problem.

Set aside our difference people. If you can't do it for a term than do it for the rest of this year. If you can't for the year do it for the people dying from Covid right now. Its not democrats fault. It's not Republicans. 

The problems we are facing (besides covid) are the result of years and years of piss poor decisions from corrupt politicians. They've had their pockets sown where they don't belong for a hundred years.

883,"&gt; they are to blame for over-inflating the price of assets

I don't agree with you.

If you have a housing problem you have a urban mobility problem.

The state, either local (county/state level not municipal) or central, depending on who own the actual power can leverage a loan program for home development, along with urban planning to develop new housing projects that are sensible in cost, integrated into the local mobility plan and won't turn into crime ghettos, at lower prices than the are marketed on the housing market.

You just have to have will, a dash of socialism, good planning and political will.

When the housing market will be flooded with cheap housing, over the market's need you will bring the price to a halt and later sensible prices.

I've lived in Italy for some time and it's far from being Singapore or Hong Kong, they have mobility problem.

You just need the police to do their jobs, the local councils to stop embezzling the local funds and work for their communities and be supported at county level. Yes people can be stupid and elect populist imbeciles, but democracy's beauty is that you can plan for any worst case scenario in the administrative sector.

If the state policy is to have sensible housing with a powerful accessible local mobility, for young people the banks can do so much to inflate the worth of their assets, because they couldn't.",Transylvania (Romania),/r/europe/comments/fmmbz2/breakdown_of_who_owns_italys_debt_among/fl7ocyt/,Vargau,1584905934

411,000 people work in tourism during peak season, of the 3.96m total working population. Tourism accounts for 18% of GDP. So immediately, we are looking at 27% unemployment, as it was at the height of the crisis. Essentially, all of the improvement of the past 6 years is wiped out.

And this is just one sector of the economy.

I really hope that the politicians are modelling the impact of their decisions very carefully. They should also be upfront with their constituents about how long they forecast these lockdowns to last (a Vaccine is estimated to be 18 months away according to Imperial College) and what the economic impacts will be.

When we see reports from Italy that the median age of death even in overloaded conditions is 80, with 99% of fatalities having an existing health condition and 50% having 3 or more conditions, its hard not to think that we are sacrificing the entirety of society for a virus which is serious, but in reality overwhelmingly impacting the elderly and particularly those who are in such poor health that they are likely to succumb to their other illnesses this year or next anyway.",,/r/europe/comments/fn28a4/greece_goes_on_coronavirus_lockdown_effective_600/fl7b7gx/,RichardEast,1584898152

The other 600,000 were bought by a company who tried to sell them for 60 times more than was the original deal with the Czech government, so the police raided the warehouse and seized it all (allegedly no documents proving it was aid were present).

1035,"&gt; Physical work doesn't make you more likely do die of lung disease.
&gt; 
&gt; 

It's not just physical work, although physical work also makes you more likely to die of a lung disease as it makes you less mobile the older you get. Dust and paint fumes from the work place can cause lung illness etc.

&gt; Why would it be? It's true.

Except it isn't. Up until the 20th century life expectancy for males and females were equal. It wasn't until then that the differences started to appear. So that rules out biological differences. 

What's left is socio economic differences, the biggest being that women, especially those that are now in the age of dying, did not or only lightly worked in their life.

Males work and worked more, are subject to more stress and exhaustion causing coronary diseases later in life. They're also subject to a higher chance of work related injury and/or traffic related injury, and are generally subject to more illness due to wear of tear of the body in their life.

&gt; These umber don't tell uns anything about how much people smoke though. Also alcohol drinking, which is a driving factor of heart-problems and meat consumption probably play into it as well. Men live less healthy than women. We always have.

I live there. I live in Zagreb. I'm going through the same shit they are going through. All educated and informed people fear the virus and will do whatever the government instructs them to do, because it is the safest option. The Croatian government has been preparing long enough for this situation and reacted immediately. Very few cases popped up in the first days of the epidemic and drastic measures were taken right away. Boarder checks were put in place on highways, airports and all means of transportation. Most people already knew how bad that virus was, hearing the news coming from Italy and China. However, of course there are people who believe it is a conspiracy theory and is no worse than the common cold or just the flu. The type of people who hog public transport from 6 to 8 AM on a weekday, only to go to the market half way across the city, even though there is a market in their neighborhood and several stores, or if they really had to go to the market, they could have went a bit later and still make it at the same time, with less traffic. Once again, not everyone is like that, but it is a common occurrence and it needs to stop for everyone's benefit and health. 

Now, many people have lost their cars and may have lost their homes. Some have weekend houses in the countryside, some lost their only home. Those will be placed in the student dorms, since college is out and students who aren't from Zagreb went back home.

Additionally, day care is relative affordable and every kid is entitled to have day care by law. Then there is gender equality and all, trust in auhorities and all that. So it is actually little to do with real happiness as we usually understand it.

1525,"We already do that in national healthcare, there is a limit on what we spend, we understand that we have limited resources and we need to balance the needs of sick people with the rest of society who is overwhelmingly not sick. Let me demonstrate:

In the UK, the QALY (years of quality life) is £20k-30k\[1\]. If we take 840,000 people dying (from the Imperial College report) in the UK, the virus cutting short their lives by an average of 2 years, that is 30,000 \* 840,000 \* 2 =  £50 billion pounds.

840,000 sounds apocalyptically high, but keep in mind that 616,000 people die from various causes in the UK annually\[2\]. There will be a significant overlap between the people who were about to die of another (health-related) cause and instead die of Coronavirus.

Instead, we are proposing to effectively curtail all economic and social activity for potentially 18 months (if we want complete suppression and to wait for a virus). 

Lets imagine this is 25% of the UK GDP, and call it 3 months of restriction.  £2.2 trillion \* .25 \* .25 =  £137 billion pounds. So even in a scenario where the lockdown is only for 3 months, and we lose 25% of activity, we are still 'over-responding' by 2.74x. If the lockdown goes on for longer, and the shutdowns increase, this gets even worse. For 12 months, with 40% of economic activity restricted, this goes to £880 billion, a 17.6x over-reaction.  


The irony of all this, is that with these gigantic economic and social restrictions, we are going to be diminishing the health of the general population, such that they may become more vulnerable to the virus! We know that GDP and life expectancy is linked \[3\], we even know that just the deprivation linked to a poor retirement, and not continuing to work when able, is linked to increased rate of death.\[4\]

1587,"&gt; Right. But some of that money that they are spending is going to be from pensions. From the standpoint of the rest of society, getting 100% of the pension money is a larger economic gain than getting increased demand and getting a small portion of that. From the standpoint of savings being spent, when someone dies, their estate does not vanish (well, okay, they could specify that it all be burnt in a bonfire in their will, but in practice, that doesn't happen). Instead, it is transferred, mostly to the young, via inheritance, and partly to the state via estate tax.
&gt; I mean, the money is just a claim on goods and services. If you're retired, you aren't generating much by way of those, but you are consuming them.

How is from standpoint of a socety getting 100% of the pension money better? Why would it be larger economic gain? What proof do you have the money is allocated better? If anything, more money is gonna be siphoned into savings and not into spending. We need consumers.


&gt;Yes -- the hit is not just to the retired. But it is disproportionately to them. Also, if someone dies, say, a year before retirement, and would have lived another ten years, they are likely generating fewer goods and services in that year than they would consume over the next ten.


But thats the point. Their consumption of the goods is generating incredible amount if services and goods.



&gt;However, the people and resources that would have been allocated to that will now be allocated to something else, and that something else will be providing some sorts of goods and services to the rest of society, which otherwise would not have received them. Down the line, they will also be generating economic activity.


Thats the thing, we have to ask ourselves do those resources still exist?Lower GDP will directly lower the amount of fiscal resources the country has...

If older people are not spending money, who will? I doubt the demand is gonna go 1:1. There is only so many services and goods one can buy and you have to take in consideration the time old people have and that they are not saving money for anyone.


&gt; The pension and healthcare is part of their compensation for working. However, because they are effectively no longer counted once dead, because you only look at the standard-of-living of those who survive, it can improve the situation of the latter


Thats what I am saying. I doubt that. One would have to keep all parameters the same, but we know that a smaller richer younger population spending habits are much different than of older people. 

&gt;If it's hard to see how any individual sees an upside, this will take the form of the young having wealth given to them via inheritance, from a surge in estate taxes providing tax revenue to the government, from a drop in expenses to the government in welfare costs that can be changed into other government spending or tax cuts, from an elimination of tying up future labor that would have gone into caretaking of elderly relatives, and in house prices dropping and thus housing consuming a smaller portion of income of those in the workforce


Are you also accouting for lower demand leading to lower gdp which means less resources for the country. You could say that many of the jobs would be eliminated with no clear replacement for them. 

Its pretty simple. Yes elderly produce less, spend less and consume less. But without them we produce and consume even less.


&gt;Now, I don't have anything more-concrete than those ballpark numbers. As I said, I'd like to see someone who works on this produce something more solid. I'm just saying that it's not crazy to say that Italy and the Eurozone in general can be in stronger financial shape after covid-19 than before.


It is crazy. Cause you first have to produce evidence that eliminating elderly and even some productive people is a net benefit. But then you also have to prove economic consequences from economy being shut down are much smaller than that net benefit.

Instead, the Crown is regarded as a corporation sole, with the monarch being the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government[166]—the executive, legislative, and judicial[9]—acting under the sovereign's authority,[116][167] which is entrusted for exercise by the politicians (the elected and appointed parliamentarians and the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from among them) and the judges and justices of the peace.[30] The monarchy has thus been described as the underlying principle of Canada's institutional unity and the monarch as a ""guardian of constitutional freedoms""[46][132] whose ""job is to ensure that the political process remains intact and is allowed to function.""[72]",,/r/europe/comments/fmp2vq/emmanuel_macron_threatened_boris_johnson_to_close/fl63e2w/,CantabrianSoul,1584853159

There was a huge shipment and only a fifth of the seized medical equipment was meant for the Chinese in Italy. It turns out the shipment meant for Italy was stolen and all the goods the police seized were stolen. So Italy would not get it if the Czech police did not find it and seize it. The situation will be resolved in this manner: The Czech interior ministry assures Italy will get its shipment. A new shipment from China will be sent to Italy since it is easier this way because whole Europe is on lockdown. The Czech side can keep all the seized material meant for Italy.

1863,"Definitely, but the solution isn't to forbid people from referring to stereotypes absolutely, tone should always be considered.  


If talking about Jewish stereotypes was absolutely banned, then it would look that you *are* in fact in control. But everyone knows that you yourselves serve the Sectoids &amp; Lizardmen, above them are The Elders, who themselves are controlled by TheSwiss™ and the chain goes on, eventually tying back to itself so it's a loop! No, more like loops within loops within loops.. all weighing against each other, each trying to survive so sometimes there's tendency to hate each other, especially if things get fucked up and you're not from my special group-loop that I choose to identify with.   


Many of stereotypes associated with Jews are in fact merchant stereotypes, think the Ferengi from Star Trek. Jews are associated with those stereotypes mainly because they're the stereotypical merchants. And why wouldn't they be? Being a dispersed diaspora gives automatic advantage of being able to provide successful communications across distances and cultural divides (assuming their culture is somewhat similar) so the natural professions often deal with markets. The cultural focus on reading helps, maybe it's even an evolutionary adaptation (if we can consider cultures as undergoing natural selection), other (mostly positive) stereotypes of Jews are Lawyer, Entertainer, Physicist, Mathematician, Chess player, Economist.  


Being a minority can be very advantageous and people within a minority tend to help each other more than members of the majority, that provides them another advantage. Because of all these cultural tendencies it's only natural for Jewish to get more successful and rich than the majority they're living with, but this has the unfortunate side effect that when times get bad and more primitive circuits take over, Jews can become an easy target.",,/r/europe/comments/fm3ebw/an_imam_a_rabbi_a_catholic_priest_and_an_orthodox/fl5d9kg/,nikto123,1584834034

1975,"I'm not a finance guy, but as a layman's summary of why I understand this to be important, for anyone who was living in a cave during the global financial crisis about twelve years back: Italy already has considerable debt.  As a result of the covid-19 situation, she is almost unquestionably going to need to take on more — everyone is going to see economic disruption, plus she's having to spend money that she would not have otherwise spent.  If Italy defaults on her debt, then it will create issues for other countries.

That being said, I'm not sure that covid-19 is a net economic loss, if one takes into account only the situation of countries and survivors.  Those who will die are disproportionately going to be retirees or nearly-retired.  Countries are also likely to see a large reduction of pension obligations and expected healthcare costs.  These won't be on the books as debt, but they are large expenses that (hopefully) governments had planned for and suddenly do not need to take into account.  Basically, those who ""pay"" the costs of covid-19 are disproportionately the elderly, who now effectively need no longer be compensated for work they did earlier in life and healthcare contributions that they contributed to of the elderly-before-now.

To put some very rough numbers on this, France, at the high side of this scale, [has tax equal to 47.9% of her GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_to_GDP_ratio), with [31.2% of GDP going to social welfare](http://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20190123-france-tops-social-welfare-spending-list-us-comes-second).  Within that, most of this spending will be [going to the elderly](https://www.thelocal.fr/20180621/france-crowned-champions-of-welfare-spending):

&gt; The report revealed that the bulk of the country's social welfare spend goes on healthcare and caring for the elderly with these two areas accounting for 81 percent of the overall expenditure.

The elderly consume a disproportionate amount of healthcare, so healthcare spending is a transfer of wealth from the young to the elderly; I don't have numbers, but I recall that one Obama-era healthcare policy was capping healthcare insurance premiums to the elderly at six times that to the young (or average of society, can't recall), and one would expect healthcare premiums to be proportional to expected spending.

I'd kind of like to see some economist doing up projected numbers showing what the expected impact is, because despite the huge GDP hits, Europe in general and Italy in particular may be walking out of the covid-19 crisis in a stronger economic position than going in, as the will-be deceased will bear a disproportionate share of the costs via services that they will no longer consume.  This may represent a transfer of wealth to the survivors from the deceased that exceeds any losses to those survivors.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fmmbz2/breakdown_of_who_owns_italys_debt_among/fl525dj/,duisThias,1584826790

Eh, I do state that the economic shutdown is much worse for the poor than the improvement it causes due to climate change mitigation. 

&gt;Implying that they pass policies that benefit the rich and hurt the poor is again, probably a complete misunderstaning of the situation or just trolling.

The shutdown due to the pandemic has nothing to do with social justice/safety measures, of course. 

&gt;Typically the people argue ""the rich are rich because they externalized a lot of costs, eg by not paying for environemntal damage or health problems they cause with emissions. So we will take that money back and fight climate change.""

Alright yeah...

2100,"I am pretty sure both of us are looking from the absolutely most pessimistic way possible. It's just that we are looking from different perspectives. I am assuming you are looking from the Italian perspective. I personally am looking from the Turkey perspective. I am looking at the possible disaster Turkey may face in the coming days, due to our terrible control of the situation, how much the issue is trying to be supressed in official announcements, and things we hear daily from non-official or official but non-governmental channels.

&gt; Turkey didn't have a covid-19 problem yet, but still Erdoğan stopped the shipment.

At the time, Iran was having severe problems, we had closed the borders, but a whole a bunch of Iranians had already made it inside, as well as flocked the Istanbul Airport potentially infecting many others, with about 20k turkish citizens were preparing to return from Mecca to various places into the country.

At the time, we were already having reports within the country that there were infections, but they were being logged in as regular flu, among other diseases to make it seem like Turkey had no problem thus far. This is further evidenced by Erdogan's claims that we received the virus from Europe, rather than the shitstorm we have faced during its inception with Iran. If anything, evidences suggest that parts of Europe received the virus from us instead, with passengers flying from the Istanbul airport.

If anything, the government was well aware of the situation and the shitstorm we would be finding ourselves in in short notice.

Also, as others have stated, the order was accepted by the supplier of masks, who has every right to do so.

You are mocking it though.

&gt; I am gonna say it again, you do not know what exactly has he been doing there

I don't need to know what an individual priest is doing. Listening to faith-leaders eventually ends you up like Iran. Eventually there's an issue which they don't understand and things are going to go badly. If you don't want to be Iran, you actually have to follow reason and not faith.

&gt;Did he look up some non-scientist friendly explanations?

I don't need to know this. The whole concept listening to faith-leaders eventually ends you up like Iran. Eventually there's an issue which they don't understand and things are going to go badly. If you don't want to be Iran, you actually have to follow reason and not faith.

&gt; Is he just reading the article or does he explain it too?

It doesn't matter. The whole concept is flawed. Superstitious people are not people to specifically listen to in medical emergencies.

&gt;Are the papers he reads actual science papers?

Doesn't matter.

&gt;Does he perhaps have some medical background?

A remote possibility of something like this doesn't make him a good person to listen to. Even if he was it wouldn't make him the best person to listen to, but that isn't even shown!

&gt;It may be totally possible that he has not done his homework and is doing something wrong. But you don't have enough information to assume that.

I didn't assume that. This assumption of yours that I assumed something like this is retarded, much like the rest of retarded messaging you write.  I never argued about a particular person. And nor do I need to.

&gt;The cost of operations in the first phase of the government to deal with the effects of the pandemic of the crown virus is about ISK 230 billion, which is just under 8 percent of GDP. The actions were announced at a press conference this afternoon. These include bridge loans to companies that the state is partially responsible for, special child benefits in June, and 100 percent rebate on VAT on home repairs.

&gt;Wages for people in quarantine and unemployment benefits versus a reduced proportion were announced yesterday. All the actions that are being undertaken now by the government due to the economic impact of the spread of the virus were presented by Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Prime Minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Sigurdur Ingi Jóhannsson, Minister of Transport, during a press conference. In short, these features are: 

    &gt;the state pays up to 75% of people's wages over the next few months
    State guarantee on bridging loans for companies
    Suspension and abolition of public charges
    Tourism funded
    A special child benefit with all children
    Authorization for withdrawal of private pension savings
    Refund of VAT on construction
    Construction work accelerated and invested in technology infrastructure 

&gt;The Prime Minister stated that there were now unprecedented times and it was, as in science fiction, to follow the journalists who were listening to the meeting, who were sitting far and wide across the hall at considerable distance from each other. Payments to people in quarantine and the state's share of the wages of people in a reduced employment rate were processed in Parliament yesterday, and Katrín said it was gratifying to find the union there. All the proposals have been presented to the chairmen of parliamentary groups and there is a strong desire for the government to do its part to mitigate the financial blow to the public.

&gt;The actions that the government is taking today because of the economic consequences of the epidemic are without parallel, the finance minister said at the meeting. Everyone is invited and prepared to face the difficulties that are facing, whether economic or health-related.

&gt;The municipalities also intend to alleviate companies by postponing the payment of property taxes by companies, subject to certain conditions, Sigurður Ingi said. If the situation worsens, the government is ready to go further with its actions.
Encourage companies not to set up people

&gt;The state pays up to three-quarters of the wages of people in a reduced employment rate until spring. The ministers' statement at the press conference stated that this remedy will be reviewed this spring and that if necessary, it will be extended. The Minister of Finance said that the government wants to encourage companies not to dismiss people, but to keep their staff through this difficult time. This remedy is expected to cost around ISK 22 billion and extends to employees of all companies struggling with operational difficulties due to the effects of the virus spread.
The state has a 50% guarantee on bridge loans

&gt;Commercial banks provide special bridging loans to companies. These are new loans to companies that have business problems. The state is responsible for half the amount of the loans that are made to all healthy businesses that need special support during these times, Bjarni said at the meeting. This increases the banks' loan capacity to companies by ISK 70 billion during the year.

&gt;Among other measures is that three due dates for withholding and insurance fees can be postponed until the beginning of 2021 and the Treasury will reimburse companies wages to people in quarantine.

&gt;Child benefit will be paid to parents of all children in June. The payment will be income-related and the total cost of the state is estimated at ISK 3.1 billion.

&gt;People will be allowed to withdraw their private savings due to these temporary economic hardships. The maximum is 800,000 ISK per month for 15 months.
Get a free digital gift certificate for travel

&gt;All citizens, 18 years of age and older, receive a digital gift certificate for domestic tourism. This is done to make people travel the country further and is a direct support of the state to the industry. The estimated cost is ISK 1.5 billion and this item is being planned in cooperation with the tourism representative.

&gt;The ""All Work"" remedy will be expanded so that all value added tax on construction work on individual housing will be refunded. The reimbursement now also includes home assistance as well as construction projects for public benefit organizations, such as sports and charities.

&gt;The government intends to pay for imports by canceling and suspending the fees of importing companies. Customs clearance fees will be suspended until the end of next year. The due date of import duties will be postponed for four months.

&gt;An investment campaign will be launched and the state plans to invest an additional 20 billion krónur this year.

A relevant quote:

&gt; Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.

&gt; In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

AndI've also said that we can't really know until the situation unfolds.

So why write about this fishy post at all??

If you read again the comment I was answering to, it seems some people are beginning to use the German's death rate as a basis to extrapolate. I think it's dangerous to base any thing on it for now, it will probably be corrected in the next days or weeks, having hope that with proper treatments a country can achieve that low rate could lead people to be less careful than they should.

I'm eager to get reliable numbers for Germany, I can't trust the ones we have now, it's too good to be true. Yet, while searching for an explanation to this statistical anomaly, the only post I found is also very worrisome about how the situation is handled. I really really hope that's just a stupid rant, and that Germany is handling this better than France did until last week. I'm French and have friends and family in Germany, I don't think anyone is cheating but afraid some can still underestimate the situation.

Well, he did a complete and utter backpedalling during this week regarding his whole pandemic strategy.

So, which advice was that, pray tell? The one that informed last week's pandemic plan, or the one from today? It sounds like you're attempting to make Johnson into a powerless puppet when in fact he's in charge.

I hope the UK doesn't fare much worse than the rest of Europe, but **still** they haven't taken the *necessary* precautions to dial back the pandemic (forced and enforced completel isolation, as opposed to merely closing some businesses).

I'm not going full Briton hater here, there are a few countries in the continent that are being extremely stupid/slow about this as well. Did you see Switzerland's numbers from today, by chance?

&gt;  He has not done anything like Trump, that is being in complete denial and spreading disinformation

&gt; If Singapore was like Italy, they would be at tens of thousands of cases already, not 400.

So they may have managed to delay the spread for awhile. Great. So did several European nations that had their first cases weeks and weeks ago and only now have a more widespread epidemic. And it broke through by a similar mechanism of returnees from abroad bringing it back as it seems to be in Singapore at the moment. If they manage to contain those returnees then it may stay low.

3082,"[“A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers”](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577)

Results The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.

Conclusions This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.",,/r/europe/comments/flxig6/a_picture_from_the_london_underground_this_morning/fl2bjqi/,Mrkvica16,1584747255

From the EU's point of view, the only way to have full access to the Single Market is to join it (i.e. EFTA). The UK of course doesn't want that and this position has led us where we are now: trying to negotiate a trade deal between 2 politico-economic entities like the EU does with Canada or Japan.

However, planning ahead on plans and actions in case of a pandemic is simply not part of what the Treaties allow the EU to do. Even if they did have someone planning for that kind of stuff it would be next to useless because the EU doesn't have the authority to apply those plans.

Any cooperation in the domain of healthcare or national/European security is left to the member states (because that's what the member states want) in an intergovernmental framework but that is not the task of EU officials. It is the task of the Council which is pretty different.

Overall, intergovernmental cooperation is inefficient when you can work at the supranational level. That allows for stronger more coordinated measures across the EU and for planning. The flip side is of course that giving the EU authority in this area is either inefficient (healthcare doesn't necessarily gain from being handled at the EU level, except for some standardization mechanisms) or is a breach of member states sovereignty by giving the EU authority in terms of public safety and national security.

That would basically be equivalent to giving the EU some power of police, something member states are very keen on not doing.","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/fle35r/italexit_italians_euroscepticism_grows_stopeuropa/fl209ju/,loicvanderwiel,1584740070

Translation from Italian:

&gt;""The numbers in Lombardy mean nothing anymore.""
This is what the biologist Enrico Bucci told Repubblica, commenting on the disconnection from reality of the number of coronavirus infections established

&gt;In an interview with Repubblica, Professor of Systems Biology at Temple University in Philadelphia Enrico Bucci explained that his observations and studies on the coronavirus epidemic (SARS-CoV-2) in Italy are very complicated due to the unreliability of official data on the number of infections. The swabs in Italy are performed in different ways and with different criteria depending on the regions: in Lombardy - the region most affected - the numbers are totally disconnected from reality, said Bucci, and getting an idea of the evolution of the infection is very difficult.

&gt;The Post has made a newsletter about the coronavirus, to update and inform about what to know and what to understand: subscribe here.

&gt;""The only thing we know for sure is that the data coming from Lombardy are now unusable. There is a saturation effect that distorts them. For those who, like me, do this kind of analysis, it is better not to take them into consideration and concentrate on other areas of Italy. (…)

&gt;From what we know, hospitals in Lombardy, now on the verge of collapse, send back many people with symptoms without swabbing them. And so the number of infected people is greatly underestimated. But as the mayors of Bergamo denounce, there is a wrong estimate of deaths too. Many now die at home without a swab and not in intensive therapy, so they are not counted as deaths for Covid-19 in official reports"".

&gt;Bucci then explained that official Civil Protection communications often lack data from some regions, making it even more difficult to study the contagion curve. For how the epidemic is progressing, and for the data we have at our disposal, according to Bucci it makes more sense ""to concentrate on the data of the provinces and individual cities"" and to avoid reading the data as a whole (""there are very different situations depending on the geographical areas of the country, the epidemic in Italy is a leopard's paradise""); but in any case, it is not possible to make predictions about when the contagion will peak, and therefore when it will decrease.

&gt;When asked to make a hypothesis on the real number of infections - those officially recorded since the beginning of the epidemic were almost 36 thousand - Bucci said that to reach the total number of infections one could use the lethality rate of COVID-19 starting from that of deaths. Even this operation has many limits, because the lethality rate changes depending on the tightness of the health system, and also for some time it has been suspected that there are deaths infected with coronavirus not included in the official counts.

&gt;Starting from the number of deaths reported yesterday, 475, Bucci hypothesized that two weeks ago - when plausibly the newly deceased could have been infected - the number of cases was between 9,500 and 47,500, depending on whether the lethality rate is 1 or 5%. The official number of positive swabs on 4 March was 3,089.",,/r/europe/comments/flyrda/the_death_toll_from_the_virus_in_italy_has_risen/fl1am7l/,parlourtrick,1584725234

This is what the  Italian embassy in Romania had to say about that:

  
""Regarding the information published in the article ""Italy accuses Romania of improper practices because it blocked a transport of protective masks"" Italy's Embassy in Romania, while confirming that initiatives contrary to international law will be denounced wherever they occur, specifies that no activity attributable to the Romanian state was subject to any complaint or condemnation, not even a moral one. On the contrary, we are sure of the collaboration of the Romanian authorities in the pursuit of the possible illegal operations committed by anyone in its territory and we thank them for this. ”

&gt;xiii.  Restaurants and other facilities that prepare and serve food, but only for delivery or carry out.

I'm sure that they actually got the situation in Wuhan under control, but find it a little suspicious that there are no or very few cases elsewhere in the country, given how infectious the virus is and how many people were able to leave Wuhan before the lockdown. Again, the number of people carrying the virus elsewhere could've been a lot higher with less drastic government action, but I do not believe that it's zero and the outbreak in China is over for good. It's surely very politically convenient to have ""no"" cases now while Western countries are getting hit hard.

3449,"&gt;	You didn’t specify any particular neighourhood, you just said “Brooklyn”. And as it happens, Brooklyn has lower density than Punavuori does.

But like I said, comparing a neighbourhood and a borough doesn’t make sense.
Punavuori is half a km^2 and Brooklyn is 250 km^2.

Which is why I picked a neighbourhood of Brooklyn. I picked 55th st and 8th ave, which roughly the same size as Punavuori.  
The density happens to be high in that neighbourhood. 

Not sure where you were heading with the elevator-part but I agree, it tells very little. 

&gt;	I’m not OP. But I could kinda see his point. Finland’s density is skewed by having vast areas that are uninhabited and are not really suitable for modern lifestyle. So people are packed in to smaller areas, while leaving huge areas empty. You have such areas everywhere, true, but I’d say on a lesser extent. For example, Germany doesn’t have such huge wilderness areas as Finland does. For other such examples, Russia has the Siberian wilderness, Alaska is also covered in wilderness. And those skew their numbers.

You’re not OP but you kept referring to them talking about an area, which is why I quoted them.  
I fully agree that nation wide pop density (apart from city states) is essentially useless.  
Like you said, Russia has vast tracks uninhabited land and with pop density they would seem tiny, but they have a pop of 150 million.  

That’s why I specifically picked out cities and compared those. Every city is different but not *that* different. A lot of them have industrial and commercial areas where nobody lives, many have massive parks or even national parks, some have uninhabited island and such. 

&gt;	There isn’t really anything to discuss here. This started from a misunderstanding which has been acknowledged.

Yes, that's what I wrote. Turkey is one of the underdeveloped country western powers outsource to.

Turkey-EU economical relationship is not balanced; one's economy depends way more on the other. What's trickier is the geopolitical relationship due to Turkey's location and its role as a migrant dam, which has been increasingly worsening in the past months.

Most EU governments have said that at least this crisis is the time to reconsider their strategic position regarding production of essential goods in foreign countries, moreso hostile ones.

3516,"true, and just like humans, there is a huge amount of them ( \~600 million ) mainly because, most of these live with humans in fact. They kill about 10 times more preys than most normal predators. Cats and felines in general, are the most efficient predators basically, they're made to kill a lot. 

They're not invincibe or anything, but they're great at catching preys, so they survive. A lot of species went exctint because of humans, directly killing them, reducing their territory, and introducing things that are harmful to the ecosystem. Such as thousands of extremly efficient predators in a area where they usually arent any.

Human action is really fucking up every ecosystem, and the evolution of them without humans would be drastically different. But we are part of the ecosystem, technically, our behaviour is just as natural as other animals' are. But it's fucking with a lot of species. First megafauna, our preys and our direct predators, they kill to feed, but we chased them, sometimes purposely to exterminate them, which is a thing no other specie does. They kill an easy to catch prey to get food, which is a part of natural selection, directly influencing species behaviours and evolution, as what ""stays"" is what survives and reproduces.

Big animals are easier to genocide, their reproduction cycle is slow, the amount of individuals is usually not that huge.

 But whats even scarier, is that the populations of insects and smaller animals that are no threat to us, or that we usually dont eat are also getting a lot lower. And when one of these species, that another eats dies, its accelerating again and again. Cats are only one small ( not really, but not huge ) part of this huge snowballing effect.

3554,"Germany has a huge headstart, and is testing far more than other countries, so will probably have far lower deaths because you can isolate mild cases faster, so they don't spread the virus as much. That seems the best strategy so far.

Here in Spain it has been a fucking disaster, and just recently regional governments are taking the lead because they see the central gov is just slow and inefficient despite their strong words. My government (Galicia) has just started a few days ago trying drive-through test like South Corea, but we're not a rich and resourceful region so who knows how many tests we can manufacture.

Also Inditex (which is a Galician company) will try to mass produce masks and other medical textiles needed, but they are still retooling so they will already be late to the game.

I'm pretty angry about this situation tbh. The central gov declared state of emergency to coordinate and lead such efforts, so everyone was expecting them to do so. Now regional governments lost an invaluable time, no matter how much effort they make. And people will die because of it.

Not to mention that some regional politicians (ahem Quim Torra) is trying to profit this situation. What a fucking clusterfuck. I had pretty low expectations for our politicians, but I don't think we deserve this. It's just too much. It's even worse when you know your country actually had the means to prevent this. We have enough laboratories to analyze way more tests, we have the manufacturing capacity, we have around 4700 ICU beds, ~150k beds in total, etc.

A formed client I had, a company that manufactures medical supplies contacted the central authorities so they can figure out if they have to change their processes to manufacture more needed supplies. This happened in Feb. Still no response. They contacted they regional gov and they will coordinate with them now.

&gt; The Flag of Europe or European Flag[note 1] is an official symbol used by two separate organisations, the Council of Europe (CoE) as a symbol representing Europe,[3] and the European Union (EU). It consists of a circle of twelve five-pointed stars on a blue field.

&gt; The design was conceived in 1955, and officially adopted later that year by the Council of Europe as a symbol for the whole of Europe.[4] The Council of Europe urged it to be adopted by other European organisations, and in 1985 the European Communities (EC) adopted it.

4023,"You're both right. He dropped the fucking ball. Republicans have been fucking this whole mess up from the start. 

Obviously, we're at a pretty bad disadvantage from the start, because of our privatized healthcare system. 

But, putting that aside:

*Trump, got rid of the very office whose job it was to [watch for and prepare for things *just like this*](https://apnews.com/ce014d94b64e98b7203b873e56f80e9a). He would go on to make budget cuts to the CDC, but those aren't set to take place right now, and I'd be shocked if Congress enacted them at any point in the future. But...not that shocked. Anyway, at this press conference last week, where everyone keeps shaking hands, touching the mic and touching the podium, while Vice President Pence talks to Trump like he's single-handedly defeated this virus himself, Trump was asked if he took responsibility for the US' current state with the virus, and he point blank said ""No, I don't take responsibility"". He would go on to talk about how ""no one saw this coming"" and when asked about why he cut the NSC staff responsible for this (to expand on the NSC part, they are some of the most direct reports the President has. The National Security Council often directly brief the President on matters of importance that fall under their command) and President Trump said he didn't know who had fired them, and it might have been someone in the Administration...he then turned to look at the group of people behind him and ask them if *they* knew who was responsible. 

Also, Republican politicians, [public figures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKbwDf51bA) and the President himself  have been treating this like some sort of secret plot against the President from the start. A dangerous mentality that *still* is resonating with a lot of Trump supporters I see on places like Facebook. The video above shows the Fox News take on it, but plenty of others have said equally stupid things regarding the virus. Trump has tweeted numerous times about how it's all overblown, contained and nothing to worry about. It wasn't until *after* private sports leagues and businesses started voluntarily shutting down that he changed his tune, and even now when he talks about it, he's clearly never really sure what he's saying. 3 weeks ago, Richard Burr, a Republican, was publicly saying this was nothing to worry about, it was overblown, etc, but then [behind closed doors at his fundraising event for his wealthy donors](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818192535/burr-recording-sparks-questions-about-private-comments-on-covid-19) he was warning his donors that this could be a huge problem, something that would have been nice to hear from more Republican figureheads weeks ago, to help ready people for the coming crisis. Instead he put his donors over his voters, and possibly himself above his voters (there's talk that he used his intelligence committee post and privileged information to sell stocks before things went downhill).

This top-down stupidity is hard to fix. Read the comment section of any US based news company on something like CNN all the way down to small local news, and you'll see the same things, almost always from Trump supporters or Conservative commentors, saying how stupid this is. I saw a guy today arguing that he was ""going about business as usual, because he didn't think he needed to be avoiding people"". Mind you, his stated job was a plumber, so it's not like he's exactly an expert on the subject...but that's what happens when you have the President telling his supporters from Day 1 that this isn't something to be taken seriously because it could kill people, it's to be taken seriously because the hysteria and problems associated with it are just Democrats out to get him. Which naturally means the best way to support *your* President is to...not buy into the hysteria, not support staying home, not support closing public spaces.

"" Li was among a number of medical professionals in Wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others when the government did not, The New York Times reported earlier this week. It said that after the mystery illness had stricken seven patients at a hospital, Li said of them in an online chat group Dec. 30: “Quarantined in the emergency department.” ""

"" Wuhan health officials summoned Li in the middle of the night to explain why he shared the information, and police later forced him to sign a statement admitting to “illegal behavior,” the Times said.

“If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier,” Li said in an interview in the Times via text messages, “I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency.”""

4207,"The coronavirus epidemic affects both Polish and Estonian society, and Poland is looking for solutions to the issue of transit of citizens of the Baltic countries through Poland - a statement of the Polish embassy in Tallinn says.

""Poland and Estonia are close allies,"" Ambassador Kozłowski wrote, answering the appeal of ""Postimees"".

He admitted that ""Poland will never forget Estonia's heroic decision to adopt the Polish submarine ORP Orzeł, escaping from the German storm in September 1939. We have and we will not have doubts about the Polish-Estonian brotherhood of arms, both in NATO and in bilateral relations. The Polish Air Force, currently guarding the Estonian sky as part of the Baltic Air Policing mission, is the best example of this, ""continues the ambassador.

""I am convinced that the foundations of the Polish-Estonian alliance are permanent, despite being subjected to crises on a regional or global scale"" - emphasized the diplomat, admitting that at the time of the coronavirus pandemic ""the illusion is the expectation that in such an extensive crisis everything would function without changes "".

The embassy's statement also stated that ""Poland, guided by the principle of solidarity, has decided to allow transit for citizens of Estonia and the other Baltic States, despite restrictions imposed due to the epidemiological threat.""

Within just 24 hours - says the statement - the information necessary to assess the scale of the project was collected in cooperation with the Baltic partners and it was decided to organize six convoys for a total of 120 vehicles (buses and minibuses) in road transit, a special train on the Frankfurt Oder - Vilnius route and to enable Sassnitz - Klaipeda ferry crossing.

Poland has fulfilled its obligations by providing transit for around 1,500 people and around 280 vehicles. Ultimately, 695 people and 213 vehicles took advantage of this opportunity.

""We are conducting further actions aimed at solving the crisis completely,"" Ambassador Kozłowski concluded, emphasizing that ""the course of the evacuation operation had the right to arouse emotions that usually accompany this type of crisis.""",,/r/europe/comments/fleg9x/today_one_of_estonias_biggest_newspapers/fkz168m/,pawel_fmw,1584660499

""Nice"" used to mean stupid/foolish. It doesn't mean anymore. It is not incorrect to say a good thing is ""nice"". Also it is not incorrect to say ""an adder"" even though the word originally was ""a nadder"" and people mistakenly changed the place of the n. Also ""a newt"" originally was ""an ewt"" but it is not incorrect to say ""a newt"" since people used the previously incorrect form so much it became accepted as correct.

&gt;So what actually makes Finland Scandinavian rather than Nordic?

That so many people refer Finland as part of Scandinavia that Finland is widely seen as part of Scandinavia, changing the definition of the word in English. That's all that is needed, really, for enough people to misuse the term so it comes acceptable. This has happened to Scandinavia and the use is acceptable in English. It is mostly people online who are not native English speakers from English speaking countries who try to correct the English use. I tried it too but gave up after realizing the use is so common there's no point to argue it is incorrect in English. I was trying to argue it from the point of Finnish language, where Finland is never considered part of Skandinavia.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/fl72ph/art_museum_closed_due_to_virus_outbreak/fkz22xp/,Toby_Forrester,1584661067

* All universities and schools are closed, all public events are canceled.
* Employers are required to monitor temperature of their employees and to put some effort into disinfecting the offices.
* All people arriving from countries with coronavirus cases have to report to the authorities and self-isolate for 14 days.

Some employees recommend people to stay home, I follow this recommendation from my employer as I can (potentially) work from home. I'm a theoretical physicist, I only need a PC, a pen, and some paper to do my work.

Ruble has completely gone to shit after the oil, with the exchange rate jumping from 69 rubles to 88 rubles for 1€ in just two weeks. I've suddenly became significantly less wealthy, again.

Some people are panic-buying hand sanitizers, toilet paper, sugar, buckwheat, and rice.

As far as I can see, the majority of people still think the entire coronavirus is just ""hype"" created by the media and nothing serious, and continue their lives as usual. However, the current trend in the number of cases in Russia is exactly the same as in Western countries so far, with the exponential fit predicting 10k cases in 16 days. I personally don't believe Russia is ready for that.

I doubt many people actually believe that it helps them in any way. Maybe take a shit.

4741,"Oh definitely. But ever since the US has been a country, it has prided itself on being a beacon of freedom and democracy. At least the majority of the European powers admitted they were being shitty. Countries like Germany, Spain and Italy have been shitty to people up until the 60's and 70's, but they kind of admitted it. 

Meanwhile, the UK has always kind of prided itself on being xenophobic and attacking everyone else, up until they joined the EU (and even then they were a shitty role model). France has been the most like the US up until the 60's or 70's, in that they prided themselves on democracy and freedom, yet were still oppressing people in Indochina until the 1960's and we're fucking with people in Africa up until relatively recently. 

But basically any conflict that involves a European power is stronghanded into it by the US. It's been that way for maybe just 40 years, but the cold war really did make the US into a shitty empire. They have combined France and the UK in one empire basically, with a hint of Portugal and the Netherlands (fortunately though, they've skipped Belgium.

And anything after 1790-1800 is mostly the US actions. Which does mean that when the US summoned it's allies for invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, those allies could have said ""no"" but didn't because they considered the human cost to be less important than the material gains, i.e, a better relationship with the US (which is also why Japan was able to help the US in some of these wars, despite the fact they are supposed to be solely defensive, just like NATO).

So there is definitely a lot of blame to go around and we can go all the way back to Charlemagne and blame him for World War two and therefore the Cold war and we can blame the Rise and Fall of Rome for Charlemagne (Western Rome) and every emperor since then has sought to emulate Rome in some way (Hitler famously called his empire the ""third Reich"", but the second one was the Holy Roman Empire [which was a federation of Germanic states and the pope had not sanctified or crowned the emperors as such, meaning it wasnt any of these] and the first one was obviously Rome). 

But at some point we must draw a line and have governments take responsibility. We can't blame the European powers for the US continuing to sanctify slavery into the 1860's, although we can blame them for introducing it and the genocides of natives. And we can definitely blame majority of the fucked up situation in the Middle East to the British and French, but the last 50 years there have mostly been because of the US and Russia, especially the Soviet Union. Without either interfering there, it is possible that the ME would have been able to recover and maintain some stability. 

I mean, it's the case with SE Asia. When the colonial powers left, the US and the Soviets didn't really participate that much there (besides the 60's and 70's) and since then, the region has been pretty stable. It is in most ways similar to the Middle East. 

Meanwhile, with Africa, it was devastated so incredibly and then ravaged by vulture capitalism of all larger nations (especially from the UK, France and the US and recently China) that it hasn't been able to recover, but that is also because the European powers in the 18th and 19th century ripped massive wounds into it that would have taken a century to heal, but was always being picked at by the vultures. Thankfully, they have the African Union that is hell-bent on creating anAfrican alliance that might be what's needed to being them stability and a shining future, and that is mostly thanks to the ravaging mayhem that was brought upon them by the empires. 

But currently, I think the US is way too aggressive and is fueling conflicts around the world that should not be happening at that scale. Most of the wars should be border wars that naturally happen in order for natural borders to be established instead of straight lines. It's one of the reasons Iran has stayed relatively peaceful in the last 100 years (except for the revolution and border wars with Iraq, they've been pretty stable) and honestly, we should let these things happen. It is a grim thing to say, but it has worked in most other parts of the world. Africa has been doing these things for the last 40-50 years and are finally getting ready to move on. Indochina did it surprisingly peacefully because they were forced to fend for themselves against empires and kinda just skipped the whole infighting and mostly diplomatically reached their borders. 

So my point is, we must start somewhere and if we keep shifting the blame, we will just end up blaming some random nameless guy that lived 10,000 years ago who decided putting a seed in the ground was a good idea. Because technically, agriculture is the basis of all modern societies and without it, we would never have had empires or even kingdoms. Probably not even duchies or any borders at all. 

So that's why I began with the US. Because it is an easy party to blame, because they are powerful enough to change their behavior.

Don't get me wrong, being myself of multiethnical heritage (Italian, Quechua, French and Spanish), i'm absolutely pro-EU; of course there are vastly different costumes and attitudes between our countries (the Italian are usually seen as a lazy bunch, French are the snobbish ones, etc.), but the real problem lies in economical and political interests.


Italy went under because wasn't prepared for such an event, because it wasn't possible to trace the ""patient zero"" and the spreading virus-net like South Korea did, because the Government AND the opposition made (and are still making) a lot of errors, and because there're still people out there that this ""flu"" is something that can't touch them.


Europe (as a whole) made the mistake of not seeing what was happening, or worst yet seeing but placing each single country welfare and economical interests before everything else... we didn't move as a ""Union"" because there's absolutely no unity.


As an example, Italy was the first country to ban flight to and from China (because of preassures from the xenophobic right wing parties) but it was a stupid decision since an asymptomatic infected person could simply travel to Germany of France, take a bus or a train and enter Italy with no control (because of the Schengen Treaty). Heck, even now every country is using a different method to proceed with quarantines, testing and positive cases count.

My local newspaper. And yes I've seen the statistics. I've also heard that the expected ""herd immunity"" might be a pipe dream since there have been reports of people recatching the bug. Also it's now spring, and with that we get plenty of additional cases of Asthma or allergies due to pollen which is also an additional risk factor for people all ages. There is no data whatsoever how the bug affects unborn children if their mothers contract it.  
People who think that statistics tell them they're safe should remember that this is a new bug, we do not know all that much about it yet and those statistics are only a snapshot of what is known at that given time.  
That's not good enough for gambling lives. Even those 2% obese people over 75 aren't just that. They are also someone's parent or grandparent, brother or sister, spouse, friend.

The numbers can and will get significantly worse if we don't try to prevent anything. Perhaps you may have seen the #flattenthecurve hashtag. That's not just some bs Twitter came up with. 

There are only so many hospital and ICU beds. If the virus spreads too quickly, it will be no longer possible to treat every patient the way they'd have to be treated and at that point the death rate starts to rise. 

When it comes to SARS-CoV-2, the whole population is pretty much immunologically naive and that's the exact problem that turns this into something worse than ""just another flu"".

Sure, but systemic problems need systemic solutions. People right now aren't educating themselves, or, if they are, they don't follow what they learn. So we need to find a way to make them.

I think it is much more realistic to get this done with economic incentives and by regulating production than by getting everyone to do the right thing, when it doesn't benefit them individually.

Even if there were no post mortem tests (inaccurate, too), then by sheer rule of exponential growth, we would necessarily have seen many more deaths from patients diagnosed pre-mortem by now. And yet the case fatality rate remains stubbornly low in Germany.

The best reasonable explanation at this time is that Germany has a much more accurate count of the true number of infected - through vigorous test and quarantine procedures, and good testing infrastructure - automatically bringing down case fatality rate and new infections through registering more asymptomatic-but-identified cases.

Aided by that Germany both has a high number of ICU faciliies, as well as luck with a younger population that initially spread the infection (business travellers and winter tourists).",,/r/europe/comments/fksxfs/11302_confirmed_cases_with_only_27_deaths_in/fkvpxs2/,Onkel24,1584574274

5430,"&gt; The commission has the sole legislative initiative to introduce measures in the EU. They’re the only ones who can introduce measures.

Yeah, and they will *only* do so once a provisional agreement has been reached in the Council. Why? Because the Commission has absolutely no power at all to force things through if the Council votes no.

Just imagine the political and PR disaster of a Commission vociferously proposing something only to face sudden defeat in the Council the day after. That's why it isn't done that way and never has been. 

In Europe, things start and things die in the Council.

&gt; The source I gave you said that the commission didn’t even informally mention the measure to national leaders until Monday.

The source you gave us is based on hearsay from a unknown *government* official. Which follows the most iconic European PR pattern of all time: ""If the sun is shining, we've done it.

Spain: 3 hospital beds per 1000 habitants. 

France: 6 hospital beds per 1000 habitants. 

Germany: 8 hospital beds per 1000 habitants. 

This means France has double the amount of hospital beds than Italy and Germany has got 2.5 times the amount of beds than Italy.

This will definitely have an impact on the outcome of the spread and mortality rate in both France and Germany.

Just to make it more edible:

Amount of hospital beds per country:

Germany: 662,320 hospital beds (shared between 82,79 million people). 

France: 400,600 hospital beds (shared between 66,99 million people). 

Italy: 192,326 hospital beds (shared between 60,48 million people). 

Spain: 138,580 hospital beds (shared between 46,66 million people). 

And guess which country has got the second most amount of hospital beds per habitants in the world, and is seemingly dealing with this virus alot better than the rest of the world: South Korea.

ECB announces €750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP)
18 March 2020

The Governing Council decided the following:

(1) To launch a new temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities to counter the serious risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the outbreak and escalating diffusion of the coronavirus, COVID-19.

This new Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) will have an overall envelope of €750 billion. Purchases will be conducted until the end of 2020 and will include all the asset categories eligible under the existing asset purchase programme (APP).

For the purchases of public sector securities, the benchmark allocation across jurisdictions will continue to be the capital key of the national central banks. At the same time, purchases under the new PEPP will be conducted in a flexible manner. This allows for fluctuations in the distribution of purchase flows over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions.

A waiver of the eligibility requirements for securities issued by the Greek government will be granted for purchases under PEPP.

The Governing Council will terminate net asset purchases under PEPP once it judges that the coronavirus Covid-19 crisis phase is over, but in any case not before the end of the year.

(2) To expand the range of eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) to non-financial commercial paper, making all commercial papers of sufficient credit quality eligible for purchase under CSPP.

(3) To ease the collateral standards by adjusting the main risk parameters of the collateral framework. In particular, we will expand the scope of Additional Credit Claims (ACC) to include claims related to the financing of the corporate sector. This will ensure that counterparties can continue to make full use of the Eurosystem’s refinancing operations.

The Governing Council of the ECB is committed to playing its role in supporting all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. To that end, the ECB will ensure that all sectors of the economy can benefit from supportive financing conditions that enable them to absorb this shock. This applies equally to families, firms, banks and governments.

The Governing Council will do everything necessary within its mandate. The Governing Council is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programmes and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. It will explore all options and all contingencies to support the economy through this shock.

To the extent that some self-imposed limits might hamper action that the ECB is required to take in order to fulfil its mandate, the Governing Council will consider revising them to the extent necessary to make its action proportionate to the risks that we face. The ECB will not tolerate any risks to the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area.",,/r/europe/comments/fkzr6a/ecb_announces_massive_750_billion_pandemic/fkvr45v/,Noodles_Crusher,1584574968

There's been plenty of research showing that pay has fairly limited impact on satisfaction with your work, once you are above subsistence level.

The reason the UK and Europe in general can still attract foreign workers despite higher taxes is because they offer a culture in which education and health care are available to all, workers rights are entrenched, and you don't see the massive disparities in income and access to services present in third world countries and the states.

Meanwhile, young people have moved most of their socializing into the digital space, to them, it doesn't matter where they are, they share pictures and videos 24/7 with their closest peer, many of whom are still alive.

Why is it that 100% of EMTs are EMTs despite what they're paid?  They find that the total compensation is worth it.  Sure they grumble about the pay, but they like the feeling that they're saving lives.  They like the action.  They like the fact they get to tell interesting stories.

I'm sure accountants grumble that the public makes jokes about them.  I'm sure they wish they had exciting stories to tell at parties.

5805,"This salary is in between the median and the mean. Let's convert it back into the units I receive it in since it will be easier. After tax, I get 3k. Rent for a single room apartment in my city is between 1200 (shitty) and 1500 (average), but I rent a room for 500. I have a 4 year car loan for a skoda fabia which is 500. I drive the skoda every day to work, 6 km each way, and I fill up one gas tank a month, which is usually 200. It's a very economical car. I can manage groceries for 300 a month, but I forget to take lunch sometimes and I buy it at work, so more realistically it's 400. If I go out with friends to have a couple of beers and a kebab, I will spend about 50. If I go to eat dinner at a nice restaurant, maybe 100. A bus ticket is about 3. A taxi ride from the center to my house which is 7 km is 25. Apart from work, in my free time I volunteer and I read books from the library (free obviously). I rarely buy clothes, but if I do, then they're second hand: a second hand dress or sweater is maybe 20, while one from H&amp;M, if it's not on sale, is 100-200.
A laptop will cost me 3000, my entire months salary, if I want an ok one, so when I do buy it, I will pay in installments. My car, which I guess you could have calculated from my payments above, was 22000 (it's used). A new phone could be 1000, but I don't need one, mine is ok still. My car insurance is 3000, but per year.

I guess that's my life right there lol! As you can see, I have the possibility of saving some money even if I do go out a few times a month or if I buy shoes. I try to save in order to not be surprised by emergency car repair, and to go on holiday somewhere nice. Usually I can save a couple hundred. I save a lot by living in this room instead of alone, however, I have no perspectives of buying an apartment- that would cost me 300 000.",,/r/europe/comments/fk7fjk/she_has_a_point/fku9v67/,anti--taxi,1584545286

After every real crisis (i.e. not caused by financial machinations), when things start returning to normal, there is an economic boom, as there is a huge demand for things that were put off while the crisis lasted. Wars usually aren't followed by recessions, quite contrary.

Of course, all of this will depend on how governments deal with the crisis. If they just throw their hands in the air, or try to pump money directly into companies, we could be facing exactly that, because the population will be impoverished.

OTOH, if they give money directly to the people (temporary UBI, or mass sick pay, however you want to call it), so they can spend it on essentials during the crisis without having to dip into their savings, the economy could go back to normal very quickly. And all those car factories that are now being mothballed will simply be restarted.

Democracy =/= rule of law. A large number of countries around the world are democracies but the rule of law and consensus &amp; decision-making is widely different. Having lived in a variety of EU countries as well, I find this to be a **fatal flaw in the European fabric: complacency.** 

Having lived through a period of high socio-economic growth for decades, Europeans (and thereby, the politicians/governments) having a very limited flexibility for anything that goes against the narrative or established framework. This can be further summarized under **seeing forest for trees** - lacking an overall picture. 

Case in point: decisive action required for pivot to the renewable sources of energy but one event and major countries in the EU scaled down on the Nuclear Power. Same goes for Migrant Crisis. Or the current Coronavirus pandemic - news had surfaced 15 - 20 days earlier with respect to the severity of the crisis and actions taken by the likes of South Korea, Taiwan etc. but politicians balked at the idea of harsh measures that are finally being implemented (lockdown). A cohesive and quick response was severely lacking.

Modern Europe(ans) should realize that although **the region continues to be ahead according to numerous socio-economic indicators - the gap is bridging way faster than they'd like to imagine.** Celebrating locally-sponsored surveys that name ""(Western European country here)"" as frontrunner in innovation and drinking own Kool-Aid, for eg., foregoes the changes occuring in Asia and risks being left behind while the rest of the world continues to progress further.",,/r/europe/comments/fkmita/rip_to_our_brother_in_the_banzone_anyway_how/fkub4ga/,Vibgyor_5,1584546020

5985,"Why do you guys have to *systematically* be so fucking contentious and antagonistic?

And why do you have to twist the meaning of my comments to make your point? How about chilling out, and taking the time to read what I **actually** wrote?

It's not about the UK ""*not having a strategy*"". It's about the UK previously following **an inadequate strategy**, and not taking appropriate measures **in time**. From the perspective of continental Europeans, who are ahead of you just like Italy was ahead of us, you are effectively lagging behind the rest of Europe when it comes to preparedness. **Full stop**. 

Which is the whole reason those memes are a thing.

&amp;nbsp;

Considering what's happening throughout the continent right now, the course that was set by your government was deemed to be irresponsible, and **rightly so**. But it's pretty much granted everywhere that most European countries should have introduced thightened measures much earlier. **It's not just the UK**.

[Sweden](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/fjh2k9/swedes_lmao/), the Netherlands, Spain, France, Belgium, many European countries have been criticized too here last week for the levity of the measures they were taking to handle the propagation of the epidemic. 

There were also plenty of posts about the carelessness of many people in various European countries. 

But so far, **you're the only ones getting batshit crazy** over being told that you're not doing things right. You're **literally** the only ones. And the belligerent way you react to this doesn't help alleviate the perception that some of you cannot even remotely handle legitimate criticism, even during such an important crisis.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I understand being mocked is frustrating, and I'm not contributing to it myself. But quite frankly, you **are** in denial and altering reality here regarding the actual behaviour, decisions and short-sightedness of your government. The UK has indeed always been following a strategy, but the course abruptly changed monday, when the Imperial College publicly warned the British government of the consequences of its previous stance toward the propagation of the epidemic:

&gt;*Perhaps our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits of the UK and US healthcare systems being  exceeded many times over. In the most effective mitigation strategy examined, which leads to a single, relatively short epidemic (case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of the elderly), the surge limits for both general ward and ICU beds would be exceeded by at least 8-fold under the more optimistic scenario for critical care  requirements that we examined. In addition, even if all patients were able to be treated, we predict there would still be in the order of 250,000 deaths in GB, and 1.1-1.2 million in the US.*

Before the ICL made its research public, the prophylactic course of your government was **EFFECTIVELY** utterly minimal and inadequate, despite being obvious that you were about to get hit as hard as everybody else, and despite the numerous warnings coming from the continent. I mean that's just a **fucking fact**, and I really don't think the whole *offended ego* attitude is helpful in the current situation.

The French government announced yesterday that France would lockdown its borders to the UK if your country doesn't take appropriate measures to stem the epidemic. The reason being, precisely, that the measures taken so far by the UK haven't been deemed adequate **at all** on the continent. Now it's your country, you do whatever you want with it, but don't come complaining when you get flak for taking inadequate decisions, because that's just entitled and immature.

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless, when I see that such a [gratuitous and pitiful troll](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/fk2e4h/uk_has_its_own_tactic/fkrhlu9/) is getting upvoted, I guess there isn't much to expect from you lot right now.

5989,"I'll put it like this; people were saying that herd immunity strategies sounded a terrible idea, and basically that design constraint should be just discarded. Just keep people well etc.

I know that the UK government were planning to do a lot of those things, and they were focused on ""not yet"" rather than not at all, but a lot of the discussion was ""You want to just let people get the disease?? Have you seen Italy??"" which is actually pretty much what this report does, just in a scientific form, to paraphrase: Herd immunity is a bad thing to aim for at all, just try to minimise contact while keeping the supply chains running and people sane.

I'm relatively confident that when this is looked over, random internet commenters (and of course WHO experts etc.) saying it was a bad idea will have been vindicated, and the UK will end up heading towards long term suppression and eventual immunisation, over giving much concern to herd immunity. But time will tell.

The key thing for lowering tempers I suppose is to reject the idea that the only reason people didn't like the UK strategy was because they didn't understand it. For example, the assertion I've heard from a few people that releasing social distancing measures must inevitably lead to the virus springing back worse, is something that this report rejects; each period of relaxing social distancing lead to a rebound in cases, but at a lower level than the original outbreak.

I wonder whether for many people, ""shutting down"" the economy, or at least reducing it to a very low level and producing a total change in society for a year, is in a sense even more counter-intuitive than the concept of herd immunity, the idea that we could actually achieve that. And it's certainly more conceptually challenging. But I personally would have much preferred us planning for how we are going to shut schools now, how we are going to provide the equivalent of free school meals to kids in need, coordinating food banks, meals on wheels etc. to get food parcels to people stuck at home, rather than tacitly admitting we will do it eventually.",,/r/europe/comments/fk2e4h/uk_has_its_own_tactic/fktziph/,eliminating_coasts,1584538796
