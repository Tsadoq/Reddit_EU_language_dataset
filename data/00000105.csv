32,"\&gt;  There is a video were it clearly shows how she sneezes in the face of an  old lady. The fact that you still say it is fake news will make this my  last reply. The subtitles might be, but you are arguing that she didnt  do it. 

Have you opened the link I provided in previous comments? it's about that video you are talking about, and about how she isn't actually sneezing or coughing (subtitles implying she is being completely made up). That was 100% confirmed fake news by every person involved.

\&gt;  1 person infected in an area with basically no separation isnt the same  as like in work, bars, schools. And the point is not only about the  government not recommending social distancing, but encouraging massive  crowds. 

It is actually worse in work (well, depends on the job) and schools, etc. because the infected person will often interact with a higher number of different people, also in close proximity, and for a longer period of time. In bars is actually even worse, because people are eating and drinking at the same time they interact with the infected person.

\&gt; Not saying they covered for pushing their feminist anti-family agend,  they wanted this crisis/market recession and the following transfer of  wealth that follows more than anything.

36,"&gt;Well, it all points towards the government learning about the new  projections that same afternoon/evening, with the numbers confirmed  overnight.

For the third time: they had data of suspected cases/pending tests, projections... so they can assume the spread keeps rising rampantly.

Crowded areas is worse, measures are taken gradually. But you dont go from under control to closing schools in 24h. It wasnt under control at all. And my point again is: at least dont encourage it. Even if you think there is normalcy and just a 10% probability of mass contagion (which it was obviously much higher given all the data they had at the moment), you should not only not encourage it, but discourage it. You cant go from encouraging to closing in 24h. If you shut schools it is because there was high risk already the day before.

As soon as those companies hit rough waves, they immediately collapse. But before that point, they outcompete companies that focus on robustness and long term survival, killing them off.

57,"Maybe we are now getting into semantics. But I am getting confused by what you're trying to say. 

In a pure technical sense, yes Italy 'failed' to detect the spread in Lombardy early. Obviously. 

But in the earlier parts of this thread, that was put in a moral context. It was their own fault etc. That is the thing I take issue with. Failing to detect does not automatically imply a failure on the part of the healthcare system of a country. Failure to detect can equally be attributed to simple bad luck. Tens of thousands of people go to hospitals in Italy every day. If just one or two are infected, but are not part of a known group at risk of infection, they will not be tested. That does not make it 'their own fault' that Italy got it badly. Maybe it was just bad luck. In the Netherlands we had several cases where people were in hospital for days or even a week before it was determined they had corona. Why were they not tested before? Because there was no indication that a test was needed. They had not been to Lombardy or China or any other known hotspot. So when you do risk-based testing, these people slip through the cracks. Because you can't test everyone. There simply are not the means to do so. 

But I don't know what type of failure you are talking about. Do you think Italy was particularly incompetent or negligent? If so, on what basis? Or is it just the technical stating of a fact that indeed, their testing did not find the early cases for whatever reason that may be?",,/r/europe/comments/fjriz4/germany_supplies_one_million_breathing_masks_to/fktqs83/,slvk,1584531486

72,"Interesting question.

I guess governments that already have implemented curfews and rationing would already be a step ahead in this case. Capitalistic (pure capitalism) countries or poorly developed countries with freedom of free roam, are the worst cases. USA is the best example of where it is the worst to have such an epidemic, people are afraid of healthcare costs, and need to work in order to pay off debt. The average citizen will try to work even if sick being an enormous spread factor.

The only exception is probably a country like South Korea, or Japan. Where even when democratic / capitalistic people are very community-aware and therefore well-organized.  
This mixed with the smart usage of technology results in a better contention and treatment of an epidemic.

South Korea designed an App where given the case that you had doubt of being infected you could make a quick appointment and go to a sort of hospital drive-thru to get tested within 5 minutes, avoiding hospital clotting, and also giving a good geographic situation report through location services. For the government this has been gold to distribute resources accordingly.

I don´t think old communism is any better than other countries, especially when it comes to taking decisions, it is one of the slowest systems, since you have many internal burdens to obtain reliable information. Plus, communist countries tend to have a lower development rate and remain at many levels a full room of coworkers waiting for the boss to assign tasks instead of autonomously knowing what to do (since everything has to be revised and approved by the system).

In my opinion the best solution is the South Korea solution, embracing technology and acting fast &amp; responsible. People are held accountable when not being civic and are helped by a democratic socialist system (supplies and money allocated smartly).

Looking forward to your point of view!

&gt;There was an astonishing event in the quarantine measures applied for citizens coming from abroad. A woman from Paris was taken off the bus carrying passengers to quarantine dormitories without any precautions, and was taken away from the region by a private vehicle. The images soon spread on social media. It turned out that the woman in question was the daughter of Mustafa Sofi, the Director of the TRNC Civil Aviation Department, Güzide Sofi. While the deputy President, the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice were receiving consecutive statements, the investigation and investigation was launched.

&gt;Additional flights with Turkish Airlines to return to our country of its citizens who want to return to Turkey in Europe was completed. Passengers on the planes landing at Istanbul Airport were moved to quarantine dormitories by private buses. Citizens who will stay for 14 days in quarantine dormitories created in Istanbul and Kocaeli will be able to return home if the corona virus test results are negative.

&gt;NO MEASURES TAKEN

&gt;In one of the buses carrying passengers from Turkey yesterday, shocking images were recorded. The bus carrying passengers coming to Istanbul Airport with the number TK1824 from Paris, France was stopped by the police. A female passenger on the bus was lowered without any precautions and left the area with a special vehicle with 34 CCP 136 plates. It was learned that the female passenger in question was Guzide Sofi. Güzide Sofi is the daughter of Mustafa Sofi, Director of the TRNC Civil Aviation Department.

NA: more people use VOIP, which means that there are a lot more toxic people speaking, as well as other annoyances like Squeakers. It's also impossible to discuss politics on US servers because it's so polarized. I hear and see the N-word being used more frequently.

Another problem are pandemics, most people live paycheck to paycheck, so one month of no work is impossible.

Another problem is personal problems that to individuals are as big as a pandemic, and means they cannot work for a month or two, but they live paycheck to paycheck.. what are they going to do?

Another problem is that the corporate world is evolving to a contractual model, what happens when you get laid off one job and can’t find another right away and you live paycheck to paycheck?

Another problem with that is that in the future with autonomy becoming better and better there will be less and less jobs for humans to do.  What will people do if they can’t get a job and there’s nothing they can do to get one?

Another problem is how difficult it is to move between fields of expertise when you can’t get the support you need to re-educate yourself.

2. There are plenty of countries in the world, where a billionaire could go to, in order to evade taxes, like Ireland for example, where the billionaires are free from taxation. In fact, its actually quite easy to [avoid the exit tax](http://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/the-tax-stringer/stringer-article-for-authors/avoiding-the-exit-tax). After all, they are billionaires. They will find a way. [This](https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax/) explains it well.
3. Wealth taxes have been repealed throughout Europe because they don't work. Not because of neoliberalism. The Scandinavian nations are social democracies, and have only gotten more and more to the left. Next, you have to realize that the 90% was a marginal tax rate on income, not net worth. It is completely different from a wealth tax. It did almost nothing to the rich b/c they all had low incomes, but a high net worth. For example, Jeff Bezos's income is only 200k, and that tax would take 180k of his income. In the end, that does nothing to his net worth b/c his net worth is from amazon stock, not income.
4. Sorry for not addressing this correctly in my post. I actually do support single payer healthcare, just not bernie's plan, which is far too radical imo. Banning private insurance would be detrimental to the economy because it completely eliminates the industry, which makes up a significant portion of the US GDP. What I mean't by choice is that allowing it to stay would enable upper middle class and rich people to pay more for higher quality insurance, which is good for the economy as a whole, and also good for those people. While the quality of healthcare under a single payer system won't be bad, it definitely could be better. This is why the European nations with M4A did not ban private insurance. In fact, many people in norway and sweden are beginning to shift to private insurance for healthcare due to increasing wealth and demand for higher quality healthcare.
5. Experts are experts. The majority of experts are not selfish and don't want to watch the world burn, and you can tell by looking into their background. The key to quality research is to determine which experts are decent (most of them are) and listen to those.

What makes sense is she is saying dont blame me that you dont have a vaccine or better ways of helping with pandemics, it takes the kind of money youre giving to messi to buy a lab and equipment to include a research team working on ""coronaviruses""

you know i set up a molecular biology lab and a lot of our equipment was well over 50K.  Most lab equipment is over 5K easy.  Then your supplies and reagents are very costly.

An example of how cost adds up is you can pay 250 dollars for a 10 uL vial containing an enzyme.   You'll
easily spend over 25K conducting one experiment.

This doesnt include mice and rats most researchers need to buy that have been genetically engineered for your particular experiment.

Now imagine another 10 researchers conducting other experiments to gather more data all needing about 25K as well.  And this is a very very small lab I'm describing.  Calculate the pay of those individuals.  

Research is expensive.   Scientist pay is sacrificed for being able to buy the supplies needed to conduct experiments.  So yeah, until people start prioritizing dont blame scientist for not having a cure for many of the diseases we suffer from.

Come on don't be so dense. They are inflated because of basic supply and demand economics.

People pay for packages to watch the football on TV, merchandise and tickets to games.

Football clubs generate revenue in the millions. Whole cities go on lock down when some teams win. It's huge and the sponsorship and TV deals associated with the Premier League for example can net a team £180 Million in TV revenue.

Teams are rewarded millions based on where they finish in the league and as prize money for winning trophies.

So a world class footballer has value because buying the best makes your team the best and more likely to win and therefore bring in more fans who buy more merc and membership and possibly more prize money.

Beloved players become household names for some and their name on a jersey is bought in the 100 thousands.

Do the math.  An adult sized Jersey with a player's name and number can cost around £60, is 100k people bought that shirt, the club has made over half a million.

599,"The question I'd like to ask is... who is this ""you"", that's giving relative amounts of money to footballers and biological researchers? 

I'm not sure she realizes that it's all of us. Humanity collectively. Because people buy tickets to football, not to medical research. What money really is, is a measure of fucks given. And under ordinary circumstances, a lot more people give more fucks about football than biomedical research. 

You can call that shortsighted, but then the logical response is ""yes... and?"".

Humanity is not *perfectable*. You can't make people smarter, or more rational, or more civic minded and cooperative and unselfish, by yelling at them. And the twentieth century was absolutely stacked with the corpses that resulted when governments tried to force people to act that way. 

The only thing you can do is educate, not scold. And even that only works with people born smart enough to be educated. 

Not only that, all the biomedical research we could afford wouldn't change the fact that vaccines take time to produce. Producing vaccines faster wouldn't solve this problem. 

The best thing we could do would be to hold China accountable for its irresponsible behaviour. But that's not going to happen, because the Chinese communist party, unlike the governments of Europe and the United States, has no conscience or sense of social responsibility to anyone but itself, and doesn't give a fuck about being scolded, which is all the west has the balls to do. 

China is going to go on polluting, go on torturing, go on harvesting organs from political prisoners, go on murdering, go on suppressing political dissent, go on violating human rights, and go on being a communist hellhole that forces its people to live in squalor and filth and work like slaves. 

Because *we* are not, collectively, courageous enough to hold them accountable. We're too addicted to the cheap products of their slave labour, and too addicted to the cheap self-righteousness of morally scolding each other in the west, because only the west is decent enough to give a crap about moral arguments. 

Pass all the labour laws, minimum wages, and mandatory maternity leave you want over here, and it won't make a damn bit of difference when you are outsourcing all your production to the world's biggest communist slave labour camp.",,/r/europe/comments/fk7fjk/she_has_a_point/fksqr62/,Whisper,1584496216

But also, the point is more towards what could be done with that kind of money which is kind of wasted in those players (doesn't really do anything). I remember I was working in an institute in Spain back when Neymar was sold to PSG. The whole institute had just received a million euros, one of (maybe the) largest prize awarded in Spain, because of its excelency. PSG gave Barcelona like 200 million...for a guy (who's salary is probably around that). It is even hard use the arguement that ""because markets regulated themselves and etc"" because this isn't even some CEO receiving millions to run a highly complicated company that is changing the world. It is entertainment, it is money being saved by some guys who don't contribute that much to anything ""productive"" (you always contribute some just by having houses, hiring people, etc or clubs by hiring people, construction...).

That said, we do give a lot to science as a society, there is just a lot of it. I don't know what gets more, all the science or all the sports. And sports/entertainement/tradition are important.

724,"&gt;I meant irrational in the sense of whats actually good for society. Reaching a billion people does fuck all for the benefit of society. Yes entertainment, but you know what I mean.

Well, I think entertainment is a very important aspect of social life. And football has many good sites which in my opinion probably outweight the ugly ones.

In any case, it's not a zero-sum game. Messi and Ronaldo can keep their wages and science be properly funded at the same time. In fact, the economic activity around football can help fund science if properly taxed. :-)  


&gt; All of this is sorely lacking under capitalism because the market will  never invest in these unpredictable things unless it becomes clear it  can make money with it.

729,"I see the problem and agree that the wages of sanitary workers and researchers should be raised.

BUT

Let's be real for a moment. Like in any field, you are paid based on what you essentially produce. Consequently, while from a 'human' perspective sanitary workers have an insurmountable greater amount of value than a football player, economically speaking football is a much greater industry. Especially through the potential advertising and the increased visibility which superstars like the mentioned Messi and Ronaldo bring to a team or club. So, from a realistic point of view, since the advertising and sports industries are worth A LOT, it makes sense that clubs pay good players increasingly large amounts of money to play for them since they often result in many times that amount being earned as a consequence.

Think of it sort of like this: Football is a movie and players like Ronaldo are actors (which you might disagree or agree with anyway but that's not the point here). If you want people to come to watch the movie, other than just a good storyline, it often helps to have a famous star actor be there, rather than just 'normal' actors. Obviously, this phenomenal actor is not going to be there for the same amount of money as some bloke that's just got of acting school, or even someone marginally less famous/talented. And why does the producer pay them this greater amount of cash? because, ultimately, their presence is a great public incentive to come watch, and therefore produces more income, which allows for this to continue in a sort of cycle.

So, while it is, unfair that the situation described in the post is true, ultimately it is basic economics. 

and yes I still think that hospital workers and researchers and the such deserve more money than they earn, regardless of what I said. I'm just trying to put into perspective why this is the case, and why it's somewhat justified (from an economic and practical point of view).

797,"&gt; They just do not take it seriously enough and it has nearly no impact on their research. If you want to get into the top microeconomic journals you typically need mathematical models (unless you explicitly do research in Behavioural Economics, then you need experiments), and models are difficult or impossible when you take these findings seriously.

I'm not sure about microeconomic journals, but look at top econ journals overall. American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Journal of the Political Economy, Econometrica. The journals that make a career. Econometrica is specifically econometrics-focused and thus a bit special, but for all these other journals it's near impossible to get a purely theoretical paper published. The overwhelming majority of research I see is empirical, meaning you observe a situation, make some (often micro-based) reasonings about what causes what or what can predict what, get data, and test it. If your theory looks marvellous but it doesn't hold up in practice, it most likely won't get into these journals (some exceptions apply). Maybe it's because I was 'raised' to be an empiricist, but from what I see every day, theory papers are often seen as ""ok nice reasoning I guess this is how these actors formally interact, now let's simplify this to one or two of these relationships and get data to see how it holds up in practice"". The reason why e.g. behavioral econ is in the econ research mainstream while Austrian whatever stuff isn't, is because the former is empirical while the latter is philosophical wish-wash. 

The 'supply = demand means welfare efficiency' is really just an ideal for a polypoly with full information and perfectly same goods, which follows from some pretty basic preference assumptions (and if you take advanced micro you usually discuss how realistic these assumptions are anyway, e.g. marketing research would beg to differ about the malleability of preferences).  
I don't want to get all haughty by comparing econ to physics, but it's the equivalent of saying 'we can launch a rocket by accelerating it to escape velocity'. That's nice, but if you want to get serious about rockets you better consider air resistance, planetary rotation, the rocket getting lighter due to fuel consumption, impacts of wear and heat on your material etc. etc. (cue joke about packing spherical chickens in a vacuum). Not a perfect comparison, but I want to bring the point across that models in general a very simplified version of reality and the standard market model is an especially simplified version for a special case. 

&gt; Normally an academic field puts reality at its center. Even the humanities are better at this than microeconomists.  

Maybe I'm hung up on your definition of microeconomics here, but there's much more than 'dumb microeconomics' and behavioral economics. Even if you go into oligopoly models, information asymmetries or game theory you stray pretty far from perfect and efficient markets while still being normal microeconomics.

The best economists actually combine econometrics, behavioral econ and microeconomic reasoning and apply each where it makes sense. E.g. https://www.nber.org/papers/w14198.pdf  

&gt; ""Taste discrimination, or a preference for the policies selected by men, will imply, for equal expected competence, higher voter utility with a male leader (sinceα &gt;0).  Female candidates will be elected only in the few cases where the idiosyncratic taste shock is sufficiently favorable for  her  among  a  majority  of  the  population.""  

That's micro 101 reasoning. What I linked above is by no way a perfect paper but not at all set by wrong priorities or idealistic.

there is no guarantee that more tax revenue will be spent as intended or efficiently and even if it is it's roughly 5 years until it gets spent differently. there's then the fact that european governments ttend to have a near monopoly or strong involvement on healthcare which means a smaller private sector and thus less places for talent to try and get more wages from.


even if I'm wrong on that there's then just supply and demand as well as there is oversaturation; scientists getting paid low amounts suggest either there isn't that much demand for their skill or there's such a huge supply of scientists that the field is too competetive thus making them cheap to employ.

*goes to look*

https://www.statista.com/chart/12920/number-of-yearly-firearm-background-checks-in-usa/

Okay, so, there is no data gathered on firearms sold, but according to that chart, in 2007, we had 11.2 million federal criminal background firearm-sale checks per year, which is gonna more-or-less map to the number of background-check-requiring firearms that are sold.  That kept rising until Obama left office in 2016, when it had reached what looks to be about 26 million and then dropped in 2017.  Dunno what it's done since then.

Nope, hasn't gone down significantly, and may be up somewhat from that peak:

&gt; 2019 is the first year where NICS firearm background checks have surpassed 2 million every month, January through June, since the NICS database was created in November 1998.

Looks like it massively rose while Obama was in office, and just more-or-less leveled off under Trump.

\&gt;  why are you using the worst case scenario to make your point?

It's not the worst case scenario. It fits the stats we have the best (as explained below).

\&gt;  The incubation period is from 2-14 days with an average of 5. That makes the increase a factor of 2.

1.25\^5 = 3 not 2, but that's not the main mistake you're making

Quoting the link you posted

\&gt;  An incubation period is the time between when you **contract a virus** and when your symptoms **start**.

So you contract a virus, you don't infect others, you don't have symptoms, then after a few days you start infecting others. Then on (on average) day 5 you start a period of several days of symptoms (you are still infecting others and in fact you are the most contagious then). That lasts till day 8-9 on average,then you have several days of no symptoms (but you can still infect others). That's day 10-11. And then keep in mind that the virus can remain on external surfaces for up to 6 days. Let's say 3 days for a total of 14 days after the infection.

Of course in the worst case you can be infecting for much longer, but we're talking averages.

So, 14 days is a pretty good estimate for when the exposure on virus starts to decrease after suppression measures are introduced.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/fjhqn5/boris_johnsons_covid19_strategy_in_a_nutshell/fkrpkc3/,ajuc,1584473481

865,"&gt;Bro, if you could only test those people that are infected, you wouldn't need to test in the first place!

Where do you think that you read otherwise?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For  every known infected person, you need to isolate and test all their  contacts, and possibly even those contacts' own contacts as well.

That's more or less what I wrote, yes.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't acess the article you've linked. It seems to be behind a paywall.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we are misunderstanding each other, the original argument was that one person suggested to test everyone with symptoms. I mentioned that the symptoms are unspecific, meaning that other diseases share the same symptoms and therefore you can't conclude that someone with symptons is likely to have Corvid-19 and that the number of people that show symptoms is most likely extremely high compared to the actual cases, so much so that it is unviable. Unless the capacity reaches a level that is sufficient to test the majority of people, tests for people that only show symptoms seem to be unviable.

Until then it seems to be completely rational how tests in most parts of Europe and especially Germany are handled right now.",,/r/europe/comments/fjtwvz/everyone_in_europe_lock_down_quarantine_distance/fkrppby/,MDZPNMD,1584473560

Or put another way. Do you remember how a short while ago Merkel said it was likely 60% of all germans would become infected? Current estimates are that 4.4% of infections require hospitalization and 30% of those require ICU care.  


So if we look at Germany, that means 83 million inhabitants \* 60 %  \* 4.4 % \* 30% = 660,000 people will need ICU care.  Germany meanwhile has an ICU capacity of about 25,000.   


Are you starting to see the problem? Right now Germany probably has about 25,000 infected and their healthcare will be unable to cope once they hit 1.9 million infected.

939,"&gt;"" Since most data coming from China is largely useless ""

source on this assertion? or are you just another ""anything China = bad"" drone?

Quoting Dr Bruce Aylward of the WHO, who has '30 years experience in fighting polio, Ebola and other global health emergencies' and who visited China for two weeks back in February:

&gt;""Are the cases in China really going down?

&gt;I know there’s suspicion, but at every testing clinic we went to, people would say, “It’s not like it was three weeks ago.” It peaked at 46,000 people asking for tests a day; when we left, it was 13,000. Hospitals had empty beds.

&gt;I didn’t see anything that suggested manipulation of numbers. A rapidly escalating outbreak has plateaued, and come down faster than would have been expected. Back of the envelope, it’s hundreds of thousands of people in China that did not get Covid-19 because of this aggressive response.""

On how china handled confirmed cases:

&gt;""If they were positive, what happened?

&gt;They’d be isolated. In Wuhan, in the beginning, it was 15 days from getting sick to hospitalization. They got it down to two days from symptoms to isolation. That meant a lot fewer infected — you choke off this thing’s ability to find susceptibles.

&gt;What’s the difference between isolation and hospitalization?

&gt;With mild symptoms, you go to an isolation center. They were set up in gymnasiums, stadiums — up to 1,000 beds. But if you were severe or critical, you’d go straight to hospitals. Anyone with other illnesses or over age 65 would also go straight to hospitals.""


Reading the article further, he goes onto distinguish between mild and severe cases and the course of treatment. Severe cases required oxygen or ventilators.

China planned accordingly. To quote again:

&gt;How good were the severe and critical care?

&gt;China is really good at keeping people alive. Its hospitals looked better than some I see here in Switzerland. We’d ask, “How many ventilators do you have?” They’d say “50.” Wow! We’d say, “How many ECMOs?” They’d say “five.” The team member from the Robert Koch Institute said, “Five? In Germany, you get three, maybe. And just in Berlin.”

So 15,000 cases spread out across the UK might not put the same pressure on hospitals as they would if they were mainly in one city or region.

\&gt;  Perhaps our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits of the UK and US healthcare systems being exceeded many times over. In the most effective mitigation strategy examined, which leads to a single, relatively short epidemic (case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of the elderly), **the surge limits for both general ward and ICU beds would be exceeded by at least 8-fold under the more optimistic scenario** for critical care requirements that we examined. In addition, **even if all patients were able to be treated, we predict there would still be in the order of 250,000 deaths in GB, and 1.1-1.2 million in the US. In the UK, this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days**, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK (**previous planning estimates assumed half the demand now estimated**) and with the NHS providing increasing certainty around the limits of hospital surge capacity. **We therefore conclude that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time.** The social and economic effects of the measures which are needed to achieve this policy goal will be profound. Many countries have adopted such measures already, but even those countries at an earlier stage of their epidemic (such as the UK) will need to do so imminently.

1989 various Chetnik groups made ""comeback ]and his regime ""made a decisive contribution to launching the Chetnik insurrection in 1990–1992 and to funding it thereafter"".[177] Chetnik ideology was influenced by the memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.[177] On 28 June 1989, the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, Serbs in north Dalmatia, Knin, Obrovac, and Benkovacwhere there were ""old Chetnik strongholds"", held the first anti-Croatian government demonstrations.[178]

On the same day, Momčilo Đujić declared Vojislav Šešelj ""at once assumes the role of a Chetnik vojvoda""[179] and ordered him **""to expel all Croats, Albanians, and other foreign elements from holy Serbian soil""**, stating he would return only when Serbia was cleansed of ""the last Jew, Albanian, and Croat"".[180] The Serbian Orthodox Church began the procession of the reliquary of Prince Lazar, who participated in the Battle of Kosovo and was canonized, and in the summer it reached the Zvornik-Tuzla eparchy in Bosnia and Herzegovina where there was a feeling of ""historic tragedy of the Serb people, which is experiencing a new Kosovo"" accompanied by nationalist declarations and Chetnik iconography.[181]",,/r/europe/comments/fk3fdx/march_pogrom_in_kosovo_1719_march_2004/fkr0dne/,ChaosPredator,1584459360

Germany started exporting medical equipment after the following

&gt;Medical equipment may now only be exported from the EU in exceptional cases: In doing so, the Commission has fulfilled a demand made by the German government. In return, Germany supplies protective masks to Italy.

In short, Italy gets masks after Germany got reassurance from the Commission that medical equipment can leave the EU only under special circumstances. Pretty much means it's hard as fuck for countries from outside of the EU to buy all the medical equipment to get it for themselves.

Nowhere is written that Germany is moving now after getting ""scolded"".

1142,"&gt;The report, published by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team on Monday night, found that the strategy previously being pursued by the government — dubbed ""mitigation"" and involving home isolation of suspect cases and their family members but not including restrictions on wider society — would ""likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over"".

&gt;The mitigation strategy ""focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread — reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection"", the report said, reflecting the UK strategy that was outlined last week by Boris Johnson and the chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance.

&gt;But the approach was found to be unworkable. ""Our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits of the UK and US healthcare systems being exceeded many times over,"" perhaps by as much as eight times, the report said.

&gt;In this scenario, the Imperial College team predicted as many as 250,000 deaths in Britain.

So, the world had [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome), [MERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome), and [swine flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influenza).  None of those became problems on the order of covid-19.  But we couldn't *know* that at the beginning.  I remember people ridiculing people talking about the severity of covid-19, saying ""yeah, and remember what happened in the past?""  That was just with media announcements and asking companies to make contingency plans and so forth.  If borders started being locked down, not only would there have been a tremendous unnecessary cost, but my guess is that people would have treated the WHO and similar even more like Chicken Little going forward.

Finally, countries are of different size and and have different levels of population movement under normal conditions.  My guess is that the US might be able to impose serious restrictions on population movement at its borders considerably more-easily than, say, Ireland or Luxembourg.  The EU as a *whole* (or, probably more-relevantly, the Schengen Area) might be able to restrict movement as a whole from the outside world.  But if you normally permit free movement of population and suddenly slam borders up, it's going to create a massive mess.  Like, say I live in Austria near the border and work in Germany.

Keeping the curve flat can be done in a number of ways, one of the most effective ways is to get healthy (read: young and strong) people infected while keeping the vulnerable population locked down. If you think this disease can get eradicated with a lockdown you're delusional.

1251,"**A broken promise to the N-VA (New Flemish Alliance, right-wing, the biggest party from Flanders) from thursday night, a betrayal to their Flemish allies sp.a (Flemish social democrats) and Open Vld (Flemish liberals): Paul Magnette (PS, Walloon social democrats, the biggest part from Walloon) surprised friend and enemy, to end in a scenario where mostly the MR (Walloon liberals) won. A coup from PS plus the Green party and cdH (Walloon Christian Democrats) pushed the NV-A off the cliff and held them out of the government Wilmès.**

In the news: after a marathon of meetings in de wetstraat (lue de la Loi, meaning lawstreet), that started thursday night, announced the political, royal enforcers Patrick Dewael (Open Vld) and Sabine Laruelle (MR) that their task was finished.

The country gets a federal government that will combat the coronacrisis. That government will be the minority cabinet Wilmès II where in only MR, Open Vld and CD&amp;V (Christian democrats, Flanders) are settling. But in the parlement they would get the support from N-VA, PS, Ecolo (Walloon Greens), Greens, sp.a and cdH and if they would get the trust from these parties,  it shall become a government in full competence.

That broad coalition wants to immediatly vote a series of authorization, where the minority cabinet can govern for an extended 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Winners and losers in the Lawstreet? De body language was shown in volumes after the press conference.**

MR-president was nothing more but jubilant, in his wake with Gwendolyn Rutten (chair person of Open vld), who both went on a picture that went viral. In times of corona this was certainly strange to do this, just after a press conference about a government that was formed under pressure of the coronavirus.

The joy of the liberal parties doesn't end. The MR party keeps the seat of premier, and a whole collection of ministers, while at the same time they will also deliver the next European Commissioner.

Open vld too, keeps all their ministers in seat, before the doomscenario from Sunday night was looking much different.

What was visible aswell, was the relieve and joy of the Green parties. Ecolo and Green were threatening from Thursday night to join the opposition if the N-VA and a combination of PS, sp.a, MR and Open Vld were going to form. They eventually came out as the ""saviors of the country"" but their only purpose was to fully distance the N-VA from the emergency government.

**The losers:**

The N-VA has nothing in their hands. Bart de Wever, chairperson of the N-VA was sitting 24 hours on a trial with the PS to combat the coronacrisis, from thursday, but slowly and eventually, did the MR push them out of the government. Until it looked like he was still allowed to join in on the talk, it didn't end up anywhere and the N-VA was ostracized out of the government.

The sp.a were trying to cost at cost bring the PS and N-VA together, but to no avail. While their ""comrades from the PS"" stabbed them coldly in the back, and went in sea with the Green party instead.

In lesser extent CD&amp;V, who were trying to undermine the situation, but were completely locked inside the government. The party that were forced to go into a minority government, where the CD&amp;V of course gets to keep all its ministers.

&amp;#x200B;

**How it all started**: The corona crisis is set to be the most serious medical challenge in decades, specialists predict.

That makes a political breakthrough, after nine months, seemingly possible with the PS. At the beginning of last week, Chairman Magnette decided, with the approval of his party agency, to start cautious discussions with the N-VA.

""Paul was quickly aware of the seriousness of the situation, and was all about one thing: tackling that crisis,"" the PS confirmed.

The corona crisis also brings PS and N-VA closer together from the Flemish and Walloon governments: contacts between Flemish nationalists and French-speaking socialists show that collaboration is possible at that time.

They are not going to call each other themselves, but phone calls from sp.a chairman Conner Rousseau to and from De Wever and Magnette then accelerate matters on Thursday in the late afternoon and evening.

The chairpersons of N-VA and PS meet together with the sp.a chairperson. A plan is agreed with those three:

The PS will form an emergency cabinet together with N-VA.

Both will make a text together, and then, with CD&amp;V and sp.a in their wake, invite the other parties to join.

The MR has to be handled with the utmost care: in the past, approaches between PS and N-VA have stalled every time Georges-Louis Bouchez (chairperson of the MR) came into play.

The question whether Open Vld can participate remained open for a while. The Flemish liberals were refused by the PS for months, in combination with the N-VA, because of ""too right"".

The initiative would pass from Dewael and Laruelle to PS and N-VA together, although Magnette asked to be able to play a role as ""savior of the fatherland"" and not immediately to put himself and De Wever in the picture.

In the presence of Rousseau, De Wever and Magnette give their word about the above scenario. They do an ""elbow shake"". High sources confirm this with both N-VA and PS and sp.a.

1256,"**Unraveling the PS-N-VA deal: Thursday's scenario tilts towards purple, in a marathon of meetings.**

On Thursday night Magnette crawls into his pen alone, and prepares a text. He immediately calls Bouchez that evening, against the spirit of what has been agreed with De Wever and Rousseau. From then on, the MR chairman is already up in arms: he knows all too well what may be coming at him.

On Friday morning Magnette also convenes his party summit. According to PS sources, he does give a consent to go further, provided that Magnette can get his own PS in a star role as ""party that saves the country"".

That annoys De Wever and Rousseau: why not already meet the agreement and go solo with a text and a very internal hassle at the PS? “Was that impulsive, as we are accused of? The chairman mainly wanted to move forward, there was no time to waste ”, says a PS person involved.

There will be a meeting with the purple parties at PS headquarters. At that time, Open VLD will come ""firmly on board"", the PS will no longer oppose the Flemish Liberals: a coalition of N-VA, PS, MR, Open Vld, CD&amp;V and sp.a is emerging.

At that time it already becomes clear that the MR will have to work: it has no intention of handing over the post of Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès. However, both N-VA and PS feel little love for the current prime minister: on the National Security Council on Thursday it takes hours before decisions are made, as a result of which the press conference comes at a particularly late hour. On Friday it still sounds overwhelming at the PS about Wilmès that she ""weighs too light"".

The plan to bring PS and N-VA together in an emergency government leaks in La Libre at noon before Bouchez, Magnette, Rousseau and Gwendolyn Rutten (Open Vld) join the table. The news is spreading like wildfire.

At the start of that meeting, this leads to a serious conflict between Bouchez and Rousseau: the first accuses the second of leaking, while everything just points to a loose-headed MR chairman, not for the first time. ""The world is not about you,"" Rousseau pushed back sharply against the fulminating MR chairman.

At N-VA people are already very skeptical: every contact with the PS or sp.a has died at that moment. De Wever will no longer receive messages and phone calls to the PS chairman, but also no longer from the sp.a chairman.

A meeting that lasts six hours between the purple parties on Friday evening is hectic. Magnette and Bouchez have a love-hate relationship, which once again emerges in full glory: it is clear that Bouchez in no way wants to grant Magnette the triumph of an ""assignment."" “Sauveur du pays?”, “After everything he has done for months?”

The case explodes after about four hours: Magnette must not become a formator of Bouchez with the N-VA and steps up angry.

&amp;#x200B;

**The purple parties click together: Wilmès as prime minister.**

Rousseau remains physically normal, that Friday at the marathon meeting where the PS chairman just got angry. Rutten stays by his side and both talk to Bouchez. They refuse to leave ""as long as there is no new appointment with Magnette"". ""We have to go through this, now we can't play games,"" they say.

Eventually the three split up, with a new appointment with ""purple"" on Saturday morning at the Open Vld headquarters. Sherpas also come along to make a text.

“Si rien ne bouge aujourd’hui, il n’y aura rien lundi. Ce serait inacceptable. No more vetoes and egos. If everyone shows a little bit of good will, something can happen today ”, Rousseau tweeted Saturday morning, for the new meeting with Bouchez, Magnette and Rutten. He is determined not to let it fail.

The struggle continues on Melsensstraat Saturday. The MR obtains that Wilmès will indeed remain prime minister: the four 'purple' chairmen will support this.

The plan remains more or less to include N-VA, just like the socialists, and so to start six with a fully-fledged government. But neither N-VA nor CD&amp;V are aware of that at the time: they only know that ""purple"" is together without them. All communication to De Wever has been stopped.

The hours pass, the discussions are about all kinds of scenarios, where for example the greens must first be ""officially"" asked to participate, and then have them say ""no"". And again the option was considered to “separate CD&amp;V from N-VA” and go for a kind of Vivaldi, to Rousseau's irritation.

“It was clear that Bouchez was doing everything he could to save time, and it wasn't going to be Magnette. That lasted, 26 hours in total. Hallucinant, ”says one source.

1260,"**The flight ahead of N-VA: De Wever is tired of waiting that Saturday.**

The N-VA chairman decides to start communicating, so as to squeeze himself back into the game: he gives interviews and even puts himself on TV, in his own words “fat against his appetite”, to become prime minister. ""It seems only logical to us that the heavyweights of all parties take responsibility and join that government,"" says the N-VA.

De Wever ""moves"": he offers the support ""of the largest party in the country"" to form an emergency cabinet. An offer you can't refuse. With purple, who then sit together, they understand the message, which N-VA has coordinated with CD&amp;V.

There chairman Joachim Coens is furious: purple continues to meet without them, as if they suddenly have a majority. In any case, N-VA and CD&amp;V do not intend to come and sign a blank check, they make clear.

""We may not even agree on the course of the ship, but now we must first ensure that it does not sink,"" De Wever quotes as a quote. That nautical metaphor will come back later.

Magnette and Bouchez meanwhile leave for MR headquarters, where they sit among themselves. Is it there that hatred returns for love, and a scenario of French-speaking forcing is drawn up.

The PS says ""that indeed a different course has been determined during Friday and Saturday"". Officially, the version is that ""the appearance of Wilmès on Thursday at the press conference after the National Security Council was so"" convincing ""that it was nevertheless chosen to allow that government to continue to exist"". But behind the scenes of the PS, even today scorn words about the inexperienced MR prime minister.

The polls gave Magnette a boost on Friday: he jumps ahead with his party and is also the most popular in French-speaking Belgium. ""Suddenly he was a different person, full of self-confidence,"" says one person.

In any case: there will eventually be a green light to still see De Wever and Coens, and to meet with the six chairs of N-VA, PS, MR, Open Vld, CD&amp;V and sp.a, led by the two royal order holders in the House.

&amp;#x200B;

**A piece of theater Saturday night in the Chamber: A potential coalition of six comes together.**

At the start, De Wever does not expect a breakthrough at all, rather a ""purple show"" to push him out. But it soon becomes clear that purple is not in line: after the 26 hours of meetings under Magnette and Bouchez, there is apparently still not one plan.

Hardly a word is said about the premiership, which is apparently an issue externally. De Wever is not right about this internally: it is clear that Wilmès can stay on.

The PS also sends a tweet about this: ""They do not replace the captain of the ship in the middle of a storm"". At the MR people are over the moon: later Bouchez actually even makes it “the general” who “cannot be replaced in the middle of the war”. In French-speaking Belgium, a hashtag has started to hold the prime minister, which Wilmès' spokespersons eagerly market.

It has long been clear to the PS that De Wever does not aspire to that premiership at all. Internally they call it ""a transparent move to get Koen Geens (CD&amp;V) into the Sixteen anyway"". The PS wants to avoid this at all costs.

Either way, it's not going to be a clash. The discussion is mainly about the timely character of the government, which the N-VA insists on. It then discusses some other dossiers, and also passes the technique of Article 195, the neutral way of simply opening up the Constitution to changes: a rather cautious proposal to ever allow a discussion on state reform.

""De Wever did not demand anything about this, he went along with everything, had nothing to make demands,"" another chairman said. ""It was indeed the socio-economic measures, an emergency package, we agreed on that"", the PS says. ""But he has also started talking about state reform.""

“If we make an emergency cabinet, we left together for six months, and maybe fighting the recession for a year. Then maybe we can talk to those heavyweights in the government, to the presidents, to prepare a big deal. During the war you prepare peace, ”says De Wever about how he formulated it himself.

Rousseau proposes a very small cabinet: “Five ministers for each language group,” he launches. This means that PS will have three ministers, the MR will fall back on two posts, N-VA will get only two, and CD&amp;V, Open Vld and sp.a will only have one. This immediately emphasizes the temporary nature of the cabinet, and makes you long for an extension and once a ""full-fledged team"". Nobody says ""no"".

The PS is spinning. “We have already made it clear there that an emergency government was not our preferred scenario, that we would rather give support from Parliament. This was no longer our preferred scenario. ”

The six split up around two o'clock on Sunday morning, and agree that their parties' sherpas will work on a five-page government statement in the morning.

1263,"**The thunder in clear skies: The PS, together with MR and Ecolo, blows up the emergency government.**

That morning Magnette feedbacks with his party: he convenes a party agency. “If I had to be chairman like that, I would immediately resign. Having to look back all the time, not dare to jump, ""says a fellow chairman about how Magnette was"" held hostage ""by his own supporters.

The fact is that there is internal pressure on the PS and the FGTB union not to join forces with N-VA. The PS chairman starts his alternative scenario: Magnette contacts Jean-Marc Nollet (Ecolo) to ensure support. They are just going to support the Wilmès cabinet from the opposition, without joining the government. This way they keep N-VA out. Moreover, an offer that the rest government cannot refuse: the bar is actually set at almost zero centimeters, no agreement is attached to that support.

The PS chairman then goes into full media offensive, which he announces to journalists. At RTL he is attacking the “irresponsible N-VA”, which “misuses the crisis to push through its own agenda of state reform”, and also “demands the post of prime minister”. He also puts his plan on the table to support the Wilmès government, to which Bouchez and Nollet react enthusiastically in the same broadcast.

At N-VA, but also at Open Vld, sp.a and CD&amp;V, people are terrified to watch the TV broadcast: no one had seen this, no one was aware.

The French-speaking press, the only one who could ever cause problems for the PS or MR, hardly responds: that is where the idea of ​​N-VA as an angry bogeyman neatly goes.

&amp;#x200B;

**The meeting of the end: In the end the curtain falls on the office of the President of the Chamber.**

The two-hour meeting continues, but the plan for an emergency coalition is shattered. Nevertheless, De Wever, Coens, Rutten and Rousseau are back together with Magnette and Bouchez.

De Wever arrives and asks to speak when the meeting starts. He wants to ask two questions: ""Is there anyone here who would like to claim that I claimed the premiership? And is there anyone here who would argue that I linked our government participation to a state reform? Because if that's the case, then I'll be gone right away. Stop lying in the media, ”says De Wever.

Nobody reacts, nobody contradicts it. “People without honor, without code, without respect, you can't work with that. Then it is very difficult, ”says De Wever. But he does not quit: it is not the situation to walk away, in such difficult times for the country.

But De Wever does not raise his voice, while Rousseau does go into crescendo. The sp.a chair has been degouted. He was still working hard on a government statement, and suddenly has to conclude that his own political family has teamed up with the greens, behind his back. It is a hard awakening, in which he does not spare Magnette in plenary session. Words like ""liar"" come on the table, while the rest hear it. Magnette remains silent.

Because the door is still open for government participation for N-VA. They link their support for the Wilmès cabinet to a deputy prime minister for N-VA and a small, slimmed-down cabinet. He wants “the big parties to have the opportunity to step in”. It is not ""because the French-speaking side refuses, that the Flemish side may not take us in.""

PS chairman Magnette refuses to allow N-VA to join, Georges-Louis Bouchez does not. He has won everything for a long time, the N-VA then, why not?

But Magnette doesn't want to know about neighborhoods. The PS offers all its votes, as well as those of the Greens, to give the current government powers of attorney. A very punitive offer, with only one condition: the N-VA may and will not be included in that cabinet.

Magnette also intervenes with a remarkable hymn: ""the powerful way in which Wilmès tackles the crisis"" and ""the risk of changing cabinets now"". Here and there people are rolling their eyes over so much theater. Magnette doesn't exactly have many friends at the table. But he does have a shot at home.

Magnette then forces Ecolo and Groen to be called in. And CDH is also added. All those left parties are on the line of the PS: a government that gets special powers, with no less than 13 liberal ministers in it, but who actually gets a blank check. The game is over: N-VA cannot match such an offer.

“Green has arrived at the meeting, and has really only made one requirement: is there certainly no N-VA in that government? That was clearly the only condition. Anyone who still comes up with a ""constructive attitude"" should think carefully about what he is saying, ""according to two Flemish party chairmen.

An agreement has been made: everyone can visit the Prime Minister later to discuss the ""powers of attorney"". The greens are still asking if they get some sort of ""talk"" with the government every week: a meager consolation prize in exchange for unconditional support. De Wever drops the words “muppetshow”. “Shouldn't you go get DéFI and PTB too? If PTB arrives, I will also ask Vlaams Belang here. ”

Dewael conducts the forcing: he wants to finish nicely, and announces that a press conference is about to start. Then he and Laruelle announce their ""success"". A crazy ride ends, with bends here and there that both were completely unaware of, with a triumph for the duo: the message that there is a ""government"" goes like crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

**And now? The hangover remains with N-VA, sp.a, but also with CD&amp;V.**

Not with Groen, who is particularly happy when ""saviors of the country"" joined in, but has nothing else in his hands.

And at Open Vld, which has been boxing above its weight for at least six months.

It is clear that N-VA lost heavily, while they were close to government participation and responsibility.

The sp.a comes out damaged: the PS put them away as “friends of the N-VA”, and most importantly, their chairman, who had stuck his neck far out, was coldly betrayed by his 'comrade' Magnette .

CD&amp;V already argued last night to get a smaller cabinet. President Coens spoke of a ""technical cabinet"", in which the number of ministers would be slimmed down. In this way, at least a few superfluous ministers are thrown out of the government.

N-VA immediately jumped to that. On Radio 1, De Wever lashed out at the superfluous ministers in the residual government: ""I have the impression that one can combat this crisis without, say, a minister François Bellot (MR), and without a minister Daniel Bacquelaine (MR).""

Within the government, and beyond, there was immediately irritation about the complete lack of text from the Prime Minister. The powers of attorney that were devised on Sunday, nothing has yet been made concrete: apparently it is not the case that a package of measures has already been prepared.

“We are still a democracy, after all, I am not signing a blank check. I still haven't seen anything, ”said De Wever. ""We will send someone to the prime minister to listen. (…) But why do we need special power? Each party will soon support emergency measures in Parliament. ""

In conclusion: Once again, after a crazy four-day drive, it seems that a unique opportunity has been missed to form a powerful government, but also to sow the seeds of coming up with a sustainable solution for the country. The fact that betrayal and lies are the common thread in the whole is not something to be cheerful about, for the future of this country.

This is not fully the why* but definitelly the how for me. 
Translations range, but will never ever be as good as original.

For example, as Poles we were blessed with the fact that Terry Pratchett was close friends with the guy who translated his books to Polish. They were hanging out, and discussed minor subtelties. And in an anti-Łozinistic act of heroism, where something was lost in translation - he'd put a footnote describing original joke.  
Originals are still just much funnier.

And the term I've mentioned relates to professor Łoziński, cursed be he and his offspring to third generation, who after untimely death of Maria Skibniewska provided alternative translation to Lord of The Rings. It was so bad in terms of intrusive changes to original material that Łozinizm is still a term for when a translators hubris runs amuck.

Silence of the Lambs: contains many hidden jokes so subtle that one actually got edited out as an error in later english editions. (""a thristhe occasion, as Truman would say""). But in translations it was never featured at all.

Petsamo was a very contested at the time, imo it would have been only a matter of time before the ussr would have made demands for it.

Also the alternative for finland wasn't realistically to just simply let things be. The ussr was scared that finland could be used to ""flank"" it from the north, that was the whole point of the first war, and of the occipation of the baltics. The chance of germany attacking finland in order to set up for their invasion would have also been very real, if finland didn't ally them. Finland would have been relatively easy pickings for germany too, and ussr controlled the baltics so going trough there wouldn't have worked as well.

So essentially finland was squeezed in between the two powers, even though that's not what it looks like on a map. Either ally the nazis versus the commies, or ally the commies vs the nazies.

1548,"For info: nobody in their right mind should currently try to cross from Germany to Poland (even if they have legal basis or are a Polish citizen and want to go home) through the trucking and car routes typically used by traffic coming/going via the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania).

There is a huge traffic blockage there with tens of kilometers of trucks (along with private cars) simply stuck for a prolonged time, while politicians have negotiated a hypothetical convoy through Poland, but achieved nothing tangible yet.

As a result, that stretch of the border is hellishly bogged down.

P.S. Additional articles about [truck queues](www.baltic-course.com/eng2/transport/?doc=154727) from Baltic Course and from Estonian public broadcasting agency (on an optimistic note, when they got promises of a convoy): [""Minister: No Poland deal yet for Estonians returning in wake of coronavirus""](https://news.err.ee/1064280/minister-no-poland-deal-yet-for-estonians-returning-in-wake-of-coronavirus).

The alternatives would be to pass through Germany, Denmark and Sweden, and then via ferry (unless ferry traffic is suspended) to Estonia, or try to get via ferry from Germany to Estonia (there may be routes to Latvia and Lithuania also, but I wouldn't know about them), but for 28 km worth of vehicles, that's going to be an awful amount of ferry trips, and drivers aren't inclined to abandon their cars either...

Anyways, I couldn't find a link addressing the Schengen ban from individual country perspectives, but I can tell you this.  Even though countries like Switzerland are ""non-EU,"" being a party to the Schengen Treaty makes you obliged to all its provisions.  In the treaty, it clearly states EU institutions govern the Schengen Area.  Therefore, as far as I can tell, alongside some conciliatory consultations, the EU can shut down the borders of all Schengen members, including non-EU ones.  It's kind of like how the EEA (single market) is an EU thing governed by EU institutions, meaning non-EU members of the single market do not have a say in the EU laws made that apply to them.  Honestly, being a member of the Single Market, Schengen Area, Eurozone etc. without full membership is precisely ""without representation"" and non-EU states in these things should seriously reconsider full membership.

I just have a hard time understanding how the fuck can you guys still think that USSR was about to go ahead with an additional invasion after the Winter War considering the international situation and all the benefits of hindsight. Do you think Romania was also in danger after handing over Bessarabia? I find that to be extremely unlikely.

The Soviet demands really weren't some sort of a hidden casus belli - they really were **extremely** freaked out by having a vehemently anticommunist state within artillery range of Leningrad. It turns out that they weren't even wrong, considering what ended up happening, and who knows if we'd even hold Leningrad if the attack started that much closer. Of course once the war actually started, the goals changed to full-blown annexation, there's no doubt about that, but after the mounting embarrassments, the leadership decided that the prize was simply not worth the effort and settled for more or less what they asked for initially. Restarting the war within the next year and a half in the world as it was at the time seems like a total sci-fi to me - I really can't see it under any circumstances whatsoever - except maybe the Western Front taking on the appearance of WW1 and both sides there being completely neutralised for many years from the Soviet point of view (in which case a German alliance wouldn't save you any more than the Anglo-French alliance saved Poland).",Belarus,/r/europe/comments/fjmmb0/finland_closes_schools_declares_state_of/fkpfuq3/,idio3,1584409164

This virus does not pose a threat to the rest of the younger healthy population.

Humanity has survived countless epidemics. We should continue living, working and socialising as usual. The damage of shutting down societies and economies is greater than the damage Coronavirus will inflict.

We should probably accept that Coronavirus is just part of the human biosphere now. Yes, the first season will have an immense death toll, probably in the millions, still overwhelmingly the elderly. But after that it will be just like the regular cold or flu. A vaccine may be available in 6 months, but even our existing flu vaccines are only partially effective and need to be renewed annually.

And before you say 'but think of the elderly!' - many of those elderly are reliant on broader economic function to provide the services that they need, and to provide the income from stocks and real estate that provides their income in retirement.

I checked my insurance and I could find that clause, but all the private insurers communicated that they were accepting COVID-19 patients regardless of that clause and they would continue to do so and that they were at the disposal of the authorities for anything in which they could help.

There are also private companies for certain services which are associated to state hospitals. They're there because they wouldn't survive by themselves in the private hospitals, which BTW also sell some services to the national health systems.

Add to that a few fuck-you-money hospitals, but their market share is tiny and their results aren't better than the national healthcare ones.

1988,"My native language is Lithuanian and because of that I think I'd find Slavic languages easier to learn than English for a couple reasons:

1) The phonetics are a lot more similar than my native tongue. The sounds are not quite identical but whenever I hear something said in a Slavic language I can very often make out the sounds and even separate words. When I started learning English and even years after, I couldn't always do that, especially with songs.

2) Grammar is similar to Lithuanian. Word order, prepositions, grammatical cases - they all feel natural to me. There are differences, of course, but relatively few. Fairly often you can translate a sentence almost word by word and that would be a perfectly valid translation. In English sometimes I need to paraphrase the sentence to convey the same information.

I get what you're saying though. If you can't find anything that you can grasp in another language, you will probably feel overwhelmed by it. English does have relatively few intricacies but they can still be difficult to understand for someone without prior exposure to them. But if you start learning a language where you recognise more things similar to your native tongue, you'll have a head start and just need to connect the missing pieces.",Lithuania,/r/europe/comments/fjpxix/no_offense/fkotckz/,blogietislt,1584394602

They routinely misplace international packages, which get lost and stuck for extended periods of time in their distribution centers. I've recently had such a thing happen to me. I was waiting for a package from the US, and after USPS reported that the package has landed in Poland, the package got lost. For two weeks Poczta Polska kept claiming that the package has not been registered in Poland, and telling me to contact USPS. One day I decided to start sending emails to every address I could find on their website, and magically, like 4-5 hours later, I received a message that the package is on it's way from Warsaw to my home.

When I checked forums, to see if similar things have happened to other people, I legit found a thread with like 500 similar experiences described.

A case like this without proper testings could cause thousands of infections and collapse an entire regions medical system, which in return spikes up deaths, and the government would be clueless because they‘re not tracing paths and testing enough people.

Hence thorough testing, tracing down infected peoples surroundings, and containing cases is critical to ensuring the medical systems don‘t get overwhelmed.

Korea despite cases like this they were able to contain it well and are now at less than 100 cases per day with 0 deaths.

I'm pretty sure our political views alter way too much to find common ground here so I am going to leave those points be.

&gt;Maybe because you are a user that cant pay for yourself. I dont care  about everyone in our society, I care about myself and my loved ones far  far more. My life is absolutely worth more to me than yours.

First of all I can pay for myself and I am happily doing that. But I still believe in a system that treats everyone fairly and gives everyone a chance to survive independent of their circumstances. Some people fall into social injustice due to something out of their control. I don't want those people to be abandoned. Additionally, if I ever get seriously sick, I want to know I will be treated equally to everyone else by the best standards my country has to offer while not going bankrupt.

2205,"As I've said before, of course I pay more in taxes my whole life than the money I've received in monthly support and the cost of the education itself. But education is just a minor expense in the whole tax system.

Lets look at it another way: Roughly 3% of the governments annual budget is spent on financial support to students in Denmark. And this is NOT a loan. This is our own money. I pay ~1300$ in tax every month. 3% of that is 39$ per month. I've received ~900$/month for 5,5 years which is 58.800$. I'd have to work for 122 years to pay that amount off. So with your logic, I'm actually NOT going to pay more than I've received when comparing my taxmoney to the whole annual budget. So in this comparison with my income and the government expenses, I'm expensive on that specific part. I didn't find how much it costs for the education in itself (teachers pay, school rent, education materials other than books, and all that), but it's not much more than that.

So, I'm going to repeat myself: yes, I agree I will pay more taxes through my whole life than what it cost to educate and graduate me, but our taxes don't only pay for education. There's pension, daycare (only some of it though), school for children, healthcare, maintenance of roads/schools/and all kinds of other buildings, salary for all kinds of government workers and all the materials that comes with the different jobs, safety net for when your life goes to shit, and most recent the upcoming safety net for small business owners in this COVID-19 situation and support for art, sport, museums and cultural stuff. And a lot lot more. It seems like you try to simplify the whole equation by leaving out every other factor in a society. 

Besides, the average student loan in Denmark was 9.600$ in 2017. High student loans in Denmark are usually caused by lazy people like me, and people who get sick while studying and need sickbreaks before continuing.

 [https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/pandemic-flu-public-health-response](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/pandemic-flu-public-health-response)   


Britain strategy is not to let it spread more or less freely. The actual strategy pursued by most CMO's in most countries is actually the same strategy which involves enacting various measures based on the current rate of infection in order to 'keep the curve level'.  


What people seem to struggle with accepting is that part of keeping the curve level involves letting the curve develop in the first place. What you are seeing in Italy -is- the plan and -is- what will happen to the UK, Germany, Sweden etc.   


There will be a rapid rise in infections, the health care system will become overwhelmed, large scale lockdowns will be announced. That is the plan on purpose.   


The reason they wait until things are already bad to enact the lockdown is because any lockdown has to be lifted at some point and if the virus is still out there and your population has no residual immunity then that means that you simply moved the epidemic some amount of time, you didn't flatten the curve at all and now the infection will spread rapidly unless you decide to enact a second lockdown.",,/r/europe/comments/fjhqn5/boris_johnsons_covid19_strategy_in_a_nutshell/fkn8r2k/,Zironic,1584358240

I’d much much rather live in that system compared to one where I only pay for myself. Also being able to care for our entire community/society and everyone independent of his status is what moves humanity forward. Everyone for himself is outdated and everyone being able to get the same top level treatment is definitely preferable over one where people go bankrupt if they get sick despite spending crazy much money for ineffective healthcare.

Maybe because you are a user that cant pay for yourself. I dont care about everyone in our society, I care about myself and my loved ones far far more. My life is absolutely worth more to me than yours.

2466,"&gt;Acting from a ""I know how TV's work, I'm smart"" point of view is just sad. Don't assume others don't, you won't get far like this.

What? Just what? Like what are you talking about here? When did I act that way lmao? The fact that I simply said resolution and the overall quality of the screen enchance the viewing experience, is now considered acting like ""oh  I know everything about TVs?"" What? I'm only so confused by this line of thinking. You've completely lost the core of the argument.

My original argument was essentially ""Quality of the content does play into the enjoyment factor of the watching experience."" We can have a debate all day about how much it matter but THAT IS NOT WHAT IM ARGUING. Like how lost are you? I brought up the example about phone and how screen quality enhances your experience. By how much? I DONT CARE. 

&gt;When writing the statement about the phone, I assumed everyone reading had a general picture of how modern phones look and work. A familiar counter: ""now try using a 20p phone versus a 8K phone, you'll see why it's essential pretty fast""

Damn you walked right into my trap... GREAT. Now please tell me how that same logic of yours doesn't apply to watching movies for example. What makes screen resolution so essential on a phone but not when watching the movie. Point me to the difference.

&gt;I think you missed my point, and I'm generally confused. I just said that for an average family, the quality isn't that much of a deal

Again you keep proving my point with this. When you say ""quality isn't *that much* of a deal you admit that it is a factor to some extent which IS MY POINT. Better quality of content (or in this example the screen) enchances the experience. Like this is getting too easy for me, when you keep agreeing with me.

&gt;It's not like they'll be thinking while watching Frozen: ""oooohh, I wish I could see Olaf in 8K, maybe I could distinguish individual snowflakes!"". 

Prolly not but they would rather watch it at 8k... Like you prolly have a TV at home right right? And it probably has like a 1080p resolution on it, right? Something close to that at least. Soooo why didn't you buy one with like a 480p resolution, with poor dynamic range, poor colour calibration, etc? You would have saved a ton of money and according to you it wouldn't have any effect on the viewing experience.... Sounds dumb right? Because that's what you are literally arguing against when you deny my point. 

&gt;Also, screen resolution is just one thing. Dynamic range, colour correction etc all play a big role in how good videos look

Obviously but why is that relevant? Like it's just an example about how screen resolution effects viewing experience.... I can give you an example about how poor calibration of the screen affects your viewing experience, if the resolution one bother you so much. 

Seems to me like you are trying to act like ""I know how TVs work, I'm smart"" ;) cus you pretty much shoehorned in some basic screen quality metrics that have little to no relevance in the discussion about my example about screen resolutions importance.

&gt;I have a 4K TV, I know how they function

Ah so you have a 4K TV... Why did you spend so much money on extra pixels, better dynamic range, etc when it ultimately doesn't matter regarding your viewing experience? 

You see how dumb your argument against mine beings to look? I feel like it just comes down to you not understand my core argument even though I've listed it off to you multiple times. 

I'll make it reeeeeeally simple for you now so you can grasp the idiocracy:

Person A (the guy I originally responded to): ""It's sad that people NEED these kinds of stuff [better video quality, VR, etc] to get off""

Person B (me): ""People do not necessarily NEED it [referencing to the video quality as en example] to get off but rather it just enchances the experience.

Person C (you) ""The content is the same (btw it's not by definition) so it doesn't matter"" 

Like you have to admit that you have maybe just confused my argument or something... You can't be seriously arguing against my point.

&gt;My point is that resolution is just one thing, and by improving the resolution you won't necessarily improve watching experience. 

THAT WASNT YOUR POINT LMAO! look through the previous comments and you will see how your original argument morphs by the comment.

The resolution is just an example I provided but my original argument, that you didn't agree with, clearly included the overall quality of the content and thus the viewing method. 

Literally everyone on this Earth agrees with that resolution is just part of the equation, that makes a good viewing experience. Stop acting like someone disagrees with that fact.

Also if you have TV with like even decent dynamic range, calibration and all that. Youre gonna have a better experience if you crank up the resolution, unless... you like lower resolution content?? Lmao.

&gt;Taking things to an extreme is generally not a smart move in debates, as it makes something with a smaller difference in real life look extreme, but when the actual problem is looked at they fall apart

Apples to oranges. It doesn't obviously work in every subject but when you have such a seemingly absolutist stance on the matter, it absolutely works. Its a way for me to show you just how idiotic your argument is.

By me asking you (a question you are, oddly enough, yet to answer btw) does it matter if it's 20p resolution or like a 8k monitor, I want to visualise to you where to problem is with your argument.

You'll prolly say it does matter (hopefully....) and my next question would be does it matter if the screen is 2k or 4k? If you say no then where is the line drawn? Does 1080p VS 4k matter? 720p vs 4k?

You answer prolly to the first one would be ""it doesn't matter much"" which is the PROBLEM. My argument isn't how much screen quality, resolution, etc matter. Just that DOES IT MATTER or DOES IT NOT MATTER. This has been my argument from the very first comment and hasn't changed since, and by you disagreeing with this very obvious point is very confusing.

It prolly just comes down to, as I said, you just being lost and confused by my argument :)

But as Trump always speaks like a half-drunk customer babbling in a bar, he could call the tinfoil people to the rescue, then say he does not agree with them. So, why quoting them?

Δεν θα κοιμηθώ απόψε. Ενώ με το Orange Man Bad το δικό σου δεν έβγαλα συμπέρασμα. Φάε την ανεργία και τους χαμηλούς μισθούς της Ελλάδος (και τις Ευρώπης σε σύγκριση με τις ΗΠΑ) μέχρι να βάλεις μυαλό.

Πόσοι από τα εκατομμύρια που μπήκαν, πέρασαν, ή και έμειναν στην Ελλάδα (παράνομα ασφαλώς) ήταν πραγματικά πρόσφυγες; Γιατί όσοι τους αποκάλεσαν παράνομους οικονομικούς μετανάστες και ζητούσαν την άμεση απέλαση τους... εσύ και η παρέα σου (καθώς και το πολιτικό κατεστημένο) τους αποκαλούσε ""φασίστες"".

Πόσο χρονών είσαι, γιατί μου φαίνεται δεν έχεις ιδέα πόσοι μπήκαν στην Ελλάδα την δεκαετία πριν τον Πόλεμο του Κόλπου (ή για την αυξανόμενη ροή την τελευταία δεκαετία). Μόνο οι Αλβανοί που μπήκαν (και έμειναν) την δεκαετία του 90 ήταν πολλαπλάσιοι από τους ""πρόσφυγες"" που έχουμε σήμερα.

Αλλά βλέπεις το ""*πολιτικό κατεστημένο, νεποτισμό και οικογενειοκρατία*"" δεν είχαν και δεν έχουν κανένα πρόβλημα με την αλλοίωση του πληθυσμού. Τυγχάνει ο Κούλης να βλέπει την εξαγρίωση του λαού και να να κάνει κάτι βηματάκια PR για να παραμείνει στην εξουσία.

2829,"&gt; First of all I’m surprised you haven’t heard these ideas as this is pretty much the baseline strategic thinking Europe has had for the past 70 years.

Not really, if that'd be the case then there would be no EU.

&gt; To your point about the EU, it could work out but looking ahead over a 50 year period I would not be so confident.

Of course not, after all, you also have no problem ignoring the last 30 year period as if nothing happened.

&gt;  Look at Eastern Europe right now. 

What about Eastern Europe? Economically most of them have been doing great and immensely profited from being in the EU. 

Just because not even a hand-full of EU members have a problem with a populist right-wing doesn't mean that's some kind of widespread or systemic issue.

However, I wonder how many employees at companies like airlines and restaurants and entertainment venues that the outbreak is shutting down could -- maybe with the aid of some people *from* a manufacturing company -- set up manufacturing lines for things like masks or other critical supplies.

It seems like there are several problems that can be solved at once here:

* Various countries need some supplies that are presently not available urgently.

* These supplies will probably only be needed for the duration of the covid-19 epidemic.  Hiring workers that you'd have to lay off at the end is kind of a pain.

* These workers may be needed again in their original roles at the end of the epidemic.

* People need to be paid (and in the case of some of these, like airlines, they can't just go hop over to a competitor, since everyone is getting hammered).

3029,"&gt;Yes, you need to pay people to produce, store, transport, and and sell all these products. If you only ship half the products to provide the same service to customers, you only need to pay half those personnel costs, by far the largest cost of most companies.

Yes, but you only make half as much money or possibly less. That doesnt help in any way.

&gt; On the contrary, smaller companies can adopt faster and have less to lose when they need to change. 

Yes, but they also have much higher RnD costs per unit. Thats why there are almost no small auto factories in Europe.

&gt; Why would new companies be less likely to start? On the contrary, it's easier to ship a small amount of high quality products that compete on quality with a reasonable margin than a huge amount of shitty products that compete on price with a razor thin margin. 

You first need the resources to be able to develop the product and market it. That takes a lot of initial capital.

To dewater large areas, they used a series of tiered canals. The lowest ones would collect ground water etc, which would be transferred into small and elevated draining canals, which end up in a surrounding canal at even higher level, which ends up in an actual river or lake or whatever.

Sometimes, one mill just wasn't enough to bridge two tiers, so a bunch were put into series instead.

3173,"&gt; None of those houses are historical. My home village looks similar and its on the middle of the Anatolia certainly not Greek.

They are historical, and I would be interested to know what your village is, most likely was a Greek village

&gt; They did that's why they are there.

They are there because like many of the Aegean coastal towns, they were populated mainly by Greeks before the genocide and Turks stole their properties

&gt;Greeks did not invent painting a simple square house white and light colors lmao what a odd thing to claim. You sure have such a low opinion of your culture if you think this is what makes something Greek.

I didn't say Greeks invented this style per say, this style developed from other styles mainly Neoclassical and baroque style, they are more emblematic of European influence on Greece and the Greek bourgeoisie who could afford to build stone mansions and villas and became popularized in Greece and within Greek communities during the 19th century

It's not just the paint, it's the whole style and design, many of these buildings even still have their Greek inscriptions
So yes, it looks like Greece because it was for all intents and purposes a part of the ""Greek world"" if you will the same way for instance you can find villages in Greece that still look Turkish

From daily sabah:

&gt;Not so long a time ago, Alaçatı was a near-deserted village of Greek-style stone houses

&gt; the vicinity turned into swamp-lands in the mid-19th century and Greek workers came to the region to build a canal, while also establishing the village we now know as Alaçatı

Yes, all theft is evil.

&gt;	healthcare are inflated due to the hospitals having to cover the lost revenue from patients who can’t pay

You mean leeches that should be left on the street.

&gt;	But you're okay with the insurance company being able to say what kind of healthcare you are able to get.

No, I get to decide what health plan I want. If I want to save money and reduce my available services, I can do that. Alternatively if I want to spend a ton, I can have literally whatever I want.

&gt;	But what if you don't have the funds, but you actually really and truly need an MRI? How is that to be handled?

Hopefully I can find people who will voluntarily help me. Just because in this fantasy I would be a bum doesn’t mean I have a right to point a gun at you and demand your money. 

&gt;	You're the kind of stupid that equates taxes to robbery. Taxes are the price you pay for operating in society. You are free to move away to somewhere without taxes at any time. If you refuse to pay taxes, you can move to Somalia.

No wonder you want free healthcare, you need a brain scan.

What a long way to say you are refusing to answer my question. The fact is the only reason you need a government to force single payer is because it must be enforced with violence and the threat of violence. Otherwise why do we need it to be law?

&gt;The company rejects current rumors of an acquisition


&gt;TÜBINGEN, Germany/ BOSTON – March 15, 2020 – CureVac AG, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering mRNA-based drugs for vaccines and therapeutics, confirmed today that internal efforts are focused on the development of a coronavirus vaccine with the goal to reach, help and to protect people and patients worldwide.

&gt;As a consequence, the company is in contact with especially CEPI and many other organizations and authorities worldwide, however abstains from commenting on speculations and rejects allegations about offers for acquisition of the company or its technology.

&gt;Based on its inherent mode of action, CureVac sees mRNA as one of the most potent molecules to provide fast and efficient solutions in outbreak scenarios, such like the Coronavirus. With inhouse expertise of over two decades and the company’s deep scientific understanding CureVac is leveraging its potent vaccine platform to focus on developing a potent, efficacious and safe and fast to produce vaccine against Covid-19.

&gt;CureVac recently announced successful vaccination results in its Rabies program fully protecting humans with two doses of only 1 microgram (1 millionth of a gram). These results are encouraging when thinking of supplying populations and people worldwide in a pandemic scenario.

&gt;The company also has long and strong manufacturing expertise for mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics since 2006. At this time, CureVac is working on expanding its manufacturing capacities to be able to provide up to billions of doses for outbreak situations like Covid-19.

&gt;Mariola Fotin-Mleczek, Chief Technology Officer of CureVac, commented: “Nature has invented mechanisms to activate our immune system against infectious diseases. With our unique messenger RNA technology we mimic nature and give our body the information how to fight against the virus. The combination of mRNA science, disease understanding, formulation and production expertise make CureVac a unique player to fight against any infectious disease, no matter whether they are seasonal or pandemic.”

&gt;About CureVac AG

&gt;CureVac is a leading clinical stage biotechnology company in the field of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology with 20 years of expertise in developing and optimizing this versatile molecule for medical purposes. The principle of CureVac's proprietary technology is the use of mRNA as a data carrier to instruct the human body to produce its own proteins capable of fighting a wide range of diseases. The company applies its technologies for the development of cancer therapies, antibody therapies, the treatment of rare diseases, and prophylactic vaccines. CureVac has received significant investments, amongst others from dievini Hopp BioTech holding and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

3266,"&gt;Edit: Forgive my ignorance, as I'm in a state of info overload, but are you guys in full isolation/social quarantine mode yet? and if so, since when?

Large crowds have been banned, most people are working from home. Certain businesses with close contact such as hairdressers, piercing studios and so on are closed. Emergency legislation is being passed every day, and today they passed legislation making it illegal to go to your cabin if it is outside your municipality, as a lot of people were going to their winter cabins, usually located in small municipalities and risking overloading local health care providers. Schools and kindergartens are also closed, with exemptions being made for children of healthcare providers.  Oslo has been tightening opening hours on restaurants and so on. Universities are closed down, most until the end of the month, for the time being.

Norwegian abroad are asked to return home as quickly as possible as airports and ports are being shutdown. Everyone entering the country are placed in 14 day self-quarantine and the national guard has been mobilized and are currently doing screening at airports. A friend of mine who is in the national guard are telling me that they're in the process of laying out logistical plans to move food in case of breakdown in the logistical chain.

With the exception of some goods temporarily being out of stock due to larger than usual demand (toilet paper, dried goods such as pasta and beans), supplies are doing good. 

Buses are still running, but very few people are riding them, and several companies have stopped checking for valid tickets and closed the front doors, to keep passengers away from the drivers. 

No feeling of impending doom, but seeing the streets pretty much empty is surreal. People are still going for hikes and walks, but are keeping their distance. I meet a friend outside while walking the the woods and we had a chat, with a distance of 2.5-3 meters in between.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/fj4te9/italy_reports_3590_new_cases_of_coronavirus_and/fkl8rmk/,skylark78,1584300970

3410,"&gt; Healthcare they cannot access.

If they are seriously ill, they will be treated at any hospital. If they're not seriously ill, whether or not they get healthcare isn't particularly important, by definition.

&gt; Parks that are very little affected whether they're there or not.

The wear is the same as any other person visiting those parks, and they have the same opportunities to do so as anyone else. The number and size of parks in a city is scaled for how many people use them, so the cost per person is always roughly the same.

&gt; Law enforcement is something they fear more than they benefit from.

The fact that they don't realize that they benefit from it doesn't change the fact that they *do* benefit from it. There would be a lot more crime in general if there was no police. The main reason why they haven't been robbed a hundred times since they arrived is that it's illegal and actually enforced.

&gt; Roads &amp; Bridges &amp; water &amp; food &amp; lights are things that would be there irrespective.

But they need to be scaled based on how many people use them. Compare the infrastructure budget of a municipality with 1,000 inhabitants to one with 1,000,000. You can't just add thousands of people and expect it to not cost anything.

&gt; If you move to Rome are you expected to pay extra because you haven't payed for any of the roads/water/etc?

News of the week: Take a guess...

* The [Federal \(caretaker\) government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilm%C3%A8s_Government) has, in consultation with the regional governments, proclaimed a national emergency plan to handle the Covid-19 outbreak. In the night of friday to saturday Belgium went in lockdown until at least 3 April.
* All restaurants and bars will be closed, all recreational activities regarless of size are cancelled. All classes are cancelled but schools will remain open to provide daycare for children who can't be kept at home. Pharmacies and stores selling (animal) food remain open, but all other stores had to close during the weekend. Public transport is still open, but people are advised to not use it if they can avoid it. Companies have to let everyone who can work at home. All sportive competitions are halted, including the prestigious Flemish cycling classics.
* There was some controversy about bars holding ""lockdown parties"" to sell out their reserves before they had to close. Experts and politicians called it reckless and going against the official advice. After the lockdown many Belgians went to the Netherlands, where bars, restaurants and shops are still open.
* Upon hearing the news of the coming lockdown, people moved to supermarkets in mass to hoard reserves. Especially toilet paper, handsanitizer, bottled water and dry foods like rice and pasta were bought in bulk, leading to empty shelves. Again experts and politicians had to tell that this wasn't necessairy, as supermarkets remain open and there's no lack of goods in stock.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/fiyn1h/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20200315/fkkazfc/,historicusXIII,1584279247

These news came from the only place where this virus was, that is the Greatest Nation of China. So, these were the facts that we had to deal with. 

There is no “choice” between Economy and Health, cunt. Both are linked, you can’t save one and spare the other. If lesser people work, the earning per capite goes down and the health system needs to be funded and people still need money to pay rent, groceries and others, without working.

3614,"France didn't want war with Germany, they clearly expressed this via Great Britain to the Germans, they even moved their troops from the border to deescalate the situation. 

Germany was held responsible for the war because they invaded France without a declaration of war or legitimate casus belli but even more so for the invasion of Belgium which was also done without a declaration of war, without a casus belli and in contravention of the congress of Vienna in which all European powers (including Germany since it was the inheritor state of Prussia) guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium. 

Germany was pretty much the country most responsible for turning WWI into a world war. They also committed multiple war crimes, besides the ones I mentioned, such as the looting of Belgium, indiscriminate attacks on civilian shipping (illegal under international law) and others. Furthermore, while not explicitly illegal at the time under international law they also introduced chemical warfare to the war and refused to sign a white peace with return to pre-war borders terms multiple times during the war which created a lot of ill will. 

So in many respects Germany did deserve all of the blame it got, and considering the situation it walked off pretty scotch free, Versailles was joke compared to Brest-Litovsk and the treaty Germany forced on Romania. The indemnity Germany was forced to pay was no worse than the one France paid Germany after the Franco-Prussian war (note that France paid their indemnity in full while Germany eventually refused to pay theirs).

I dont know about european immigration but the first wave of middle eastern immigrants I wrote about was mid 80's, that's when a lot of the Iranians we have came (including my parents). I don't know enough about North African immigration to say anything about that. There's a reason the right wing extremists started popping up around the same time. This is ignoring Jewish migrants after ww2 btw. 

The immigration wave of the 90's was the fleeing Yugoslavians, who are known to be extremely well integrated today. Back then there was however the same worries that some have today that they would never be able to integrate because of the cultural differences they grew up with and all that, now they are the ones saying it. Just like the wave before became the ones saying it about them. So yeah, fear of the impacts of a new culture is very common in Sweden but basing it on ethnicality and looks, that's to say racism, is very much not. I understand it may seem like it is common from online forums but in real life it's a minority.

The spread of COVID-19 is inevitable because of the exponential growth of the virus. Locking down a country does not kill the virus or stop it from spreading. This means there is no point in shutting down the country this early and why the Government is focusing on health promotion campaigns such as how to effectively wash your hands (btw it is amazing how many people in the public do not know or even bother to do this) and making people isolate if they have symptoms of the virus.

Second, finally someone is talking about the ideological perspectives in Europe!

Third, I think you brought interesting points talking about the ""conservatives"" and ""polite society"". And I want to talk about these points a little bit:

It is because that most mainstream conservatives don't go against this polite society that now you have right-wing extremists rising up in Europe (obviously the refugee crisis is another main factor) . This wave of ""populism"" or whatever you want to call it. And what I fear even more, in my opinion, that even populist non-extremists won't have the best of interests of their people and Europe 

In my opinion, Europe needs to understand that this liberal internationalism that they have  pursued cannot be applied to heavily ideologically driven entities like Mainland China , for example.  You cannot expect world peace to continue if you are getting the short end of the stick due to ""communist-capitalist"" entities (like the  U.S and China) .

Austria has about 2000 intensive care beds in total half of which are expected to be filled since we are at the height of the flu season - which reduces it to 1000 free beds. If the number of people who need the intensive care stays the same, that would mean that 200 000 people will need intensive care within the next two months, meaning that there will be people who can't get proper care since the system is overloaded.

 Between the United States and Germany, the Corona crisis is reported to  lead to an indirect but tangible economic policy debate.  The reason: Us President Donald Trump  tries to lure German scientists working on a potential corona vaccine  to America with high financial donations or to secure the drug  exclusively for his country.  WELT AM SONNTAG experienced this in government circles. 

The US president allegedly offers the company a large amount to secure its work exclusively.  Trump is doing everything possible to get a vaccine for the United States.  ""But only for the USA,"" says the federal government. 

According to information from WELT AM SONNTAG, the dispute between the  two states is about the company CureVac, which is based in Tübingen and  works together with the federally owned Paul Ehrlich Institute for  Vaccines and Biomedical Medicines on the production of a vaccine against the virus.  Government officials are now negotiating with CureVac. 

 ""The Federal Government is very interested in the fact that vaccines  and active substances against the novel corona virus are also being  developed in Germany and Europe,"" confirmed a spokesman for the Ministry  of Health WELT AM SONNTAG.   ""In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the  company CureVac."" In Berlin, one hears, try to keep the company with  financial offers.

The reason: US President Donald Trump is trying to attract German scientists working on a potential corona vaccine to America with large financial contributions or to **secure the drug exclusively for his country**. WELT AM SONNTAG found out about this in government circles.

The US president is allegedly offering the company a large sum of money to secure their work exclusively. Trump would do anything to get a vaccine for the USA. **""But only for the United States,""** according to the federal government.

According to information provided by WELT AM SONNTAG, the dispute between the two countries involves the Tübingen-based company CureVac, which is working on the production of a vaccine against the virus in cooperation with the Paul Ehrlich Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Drugs, which is owned by the German government. Representatives of the German government are now negotiating with CureVac.

""The German government is very interested in the development of vaccines and active substances against the novel corona virus in Germany and Europe,"" confirmed a spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, WELT AM SONNTAG, adding that ""the government is in intensive exchange with CureVac in this regard. Germany, it is said in Berlin, try to keep the company with financial offers. The company itself refused to answer questions.

&gt;**Cocaine use, especially in the snortable powder form, is relatively common among outgoing young people and young adults.** There are signs of an increase in the popularity of cocaine, especially in Amsterdam. There is no insight into local developments elsewhere. Among Amsterdam café visitors, the percentage who had used cocaine in the past month rose from 15% in 2014 to 22% in 2018.

 [https://www.trimbos.nl/kennis/cijfers/cijfers-drugs](https://www.trimbos.nl/kennis/cijfers/cijfers-drugs) 

&gt;700,000 Dutch people have used cocaine and 80,000 people took a pinch of the white powder last month, according to the National Drugs Monitor. In the Amsterdam Zuidas, the financial heart of the Netherlands, **the use of coke among young, highly educated, super-ambitious employees seems the most natural thing in the world.**

&gt;Drug use is at record highs in the Netherlands. **The number of people who have used ecstasy, cocaine and amphetamine (speed) in the past year is two to three times higher than in 2005,** according to figures from the Trimbos Institute, where it should be noted that the measurement methods are improving.

At the bottom we got the ""traditional junk"", who is:

&gt;But the fact that this group, **mostly addicted to heroin**, has become less visible does not mean that they have completely disappeared.  
&gt;  
&gt;**However, the number of traditional junkies has been decreasing for years,** addiction experts conclude based on the number of people who receive methadone from GGD or a GP, among other things.

So what we got is a decrease in ""traditional junks"" over time. Yet we see an explosion in drug use. That means other people are using this stuff. And that is - at least here - primarily people going clubbing, people in the financial sector, middle and upper class wanting to ""unwind"" in the weekend.

4307,"&gt; How are 1868 and 1918 data relevant in this context, when we are comparing what happened before 1848?

Before 1848 the Hungarian Parliament was not a sovereign power, neither was the Transylvanian one. As a matter of fact PMs could and were arrested on whims, like Kossuth or Wesselényi.

&gt; Let me remind you that minority laws were shit in Hungary

There was no minority law before 1849 at all, since Hungarians themselves were an oppressed minority as well. As I already said Hungarian was not an official language of the country, in fact it was frowned upon to speak it at all. Batthyány (the minister president of 1848) couldn't even speak Hungarian properly when he was executed for treason, neither could, as I already mentioned most of the 13 generals murdered at Arad.

&gt; since there was a lot of discrimination based on religion first of all. In some regions (Maramures), it was even forbidden to build Orthodox churches.

Lol. And who do you think you can thank for the religious intolerance? In the Transylvanian Principality there was absolute religious freedom, this was in fact reversed under the rule of III. Károly and his darling daughter the oh-so-liberal Maria Theresia. And it was not only Orthodox churches which were oppressed, this was also true for Lutheran, Calvinist and Unitarian churches. The diet was not once convened in this era (from 1707 to 1848), so maybe you could stop pretending this was all somehow the fault of them.

&gt; They were not allowed to settle in the cities.

Serfs were not allowed to settle in cities. So that affected my ancestors as much as yours, and by the way it was also not the very enlightened Habsburgs who made an end of this practice but the evil Hungarian Parliament of 1848 which *abolished* serfdom.

&gt; Let's add to this the famous Transylvanian Diet that ""coincidentally"" lacked one of, if not the most numerous ethnic group: Romanians.

Factually wrong, there were several Romanians in the 1848 diet.

&gt; I'd like to see some proof of the 1918 data since I highly doubt it.

As I said it's in Z. Paclisanu's book.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyarization#Education

&gt; they started a heavy Magyarisation campaign

Factually wrong again. Magyarization in fact started in the 1880s, and gathered steam at the turn of the century.

&gt; The number of Romanian schools dropped in the 1848-1918 timeframe and if Romanians had it quite badly

The number of Romanian schools actually stagnated, but it is true that Slovak and German schools were turned into Hungarian ones.

&gt; Minorities had a chance to live under both Habsburg and Hungarian rule and as you noticed, they all chose the Habsburg rule.

Except they did not, Slovaks in 1848 mostly sided with Hungarians, same goes for Germans. Mind you, in 1848 no one had yet to live under Hungarian rule, since Habsburgs practiced absolute rule, it took a lot of effort and almost a century to make the Hungarian Parliament again to a real legislative institution.",Buda is vidék,/r/europe/comments/fijqp5/162_years_ago_the_15th_of_march_1848_the/fkijckg/,Timoleon_of__Corinth,1584221377

4345,"&gt;The Government held a telephone session today, March 14, 2020, at which it adopted a Decision on Exceptional Price Control Measures for Certain Products.

&gt;This Decision is made to prevent the negative effects of changes in individual product prices and to prevent monopolistic pricing of products in relation to the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Republic of Croatia, thereby ensuring the protection of human health and life.

&gt;The decision determines the products to which the price control measure applies: flour, milk and milk powder, eggs, sugar, salt, rice, pasta, fresh meat, fish, fruits and vegetables, canned meat, canned food, edible oil, baby food  , baby diapers, drinking water, laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, soap, water, space and hand disinfectants (including concentrated alcohol), protective overalls and other protective and medical clothing and footwear, goggles and visors, safety gloves  , shoe covers, masks - surgical, FFP2, FFP3, respirators / transport ventilators, medicines and medical products, and bedding and other underwear for the healthcare system.

&gt;The decision applies to entities engaged in the registered activity of production and trade in the territory of the Republic of Croatia.

&gt;**In accordance with the Exceptional Price Control Act, the highest price is considered to be the price of a product as of January 30, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus a public health threat of international importance.**",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/fiq049/croatia_implements_price_controls/fkijzcu/,badblueboy146,1584221808

4350,"People may be buying toilet paper for a number of reasons.

The first is entirely rational: they need at all times to have two weeks worth of toilet paper in the house because if they, or a member of their household, gets ill then they will need to isolate themselves for two weeks.

The second is privately rational but leads to a publicly irrational outcome - it's a classic prisoner's dilemma. You buy more toilet paper than you need (i.e. *more than* two weeks' worth) because you worry everyone else will also buy more than they need, so if you don't buy it now then there might be none on the shelves when you do need to buy it. But if everyone behaves like this, it causes the empty shelves that people are worried about in the first place.

The third is fully irrational - blind panic. When you see those pictures of people leaving the supermarket with trolley loads of toilet paper, that's not because they're stocking up for two weeks or for 'two weeks plus a prisoner's dilemma buffer'. They're just grabbing everything they can and acting like stupid panicked animals. Fuck those people.

A fourth potential reason too, albeit one that I haven't seen any evidence of, is profiteering - people taking advantage of a crisis to hoard essentials like toilet paper that they plan to sell on to the public at a large markup at a later point.",,/r/europe/comments/fii5yv/so_i_maybe_have_had_to_queue_for_20_mins_to_get/fkik24x/,theinspectorst,1584221860

4354,"&gt; Which, based on our current numbers of people in ICU, would be around 30 infected people, very far from the truth.

Do you understand that this is the only reliable piece of information we will have in the upcoming days? It's out there, spreading. We aren't and won't be able to follow all the cases and test them anymore. And it's not something that our new government came up with, the former one was announcing it too (""phase 2""). Of course, with more deaths (which come relatively late in the disease's progression) and bigger numbers, this info will get more reliable.

&gt;  I am bitching about our new retarded government that has no idea what they're doing. There will be no more official real number of confirmed cases.

Due to nature of a virus, there never were. The number that was on tv was a number of positive tested people. That's all. How many people were skiing and brought back the virus, and had few symptoms?  No one knows. And putting it on the new government after 1 day, even though Sarec and many other announced the same thing few days before is unfair i think.

This will be compounded by issues with supply.  Hospital personnel have the proper training in how and when to use them.  And they need to supply now because they have lots of people who need protecting in hospitals.   When you take a supply that is meant to  be used by a few million people who work in all the combined hospitals  and other health care centers now being used by 450 million people in Europe, or similarly the 370 million in the US/Canada..... those supplies the health care industry itself needs so that average idiots who don't know how to use it can be given a false sense of security.... and then the hospitals start loosing the health care fight because you took all their supplies from them.... that's not going to help anyone and instead will just lead to what were avoidable deaths. 

And if you think and industry that normally makes X items can just scale up to making 100X items over night, that's just crazy talk.  Especially when the time period they needed to scale up  that production isn't started today, but something they needed to start a year ago.  In short, we're already behind the productive curve and average people who aren't going to be helped by using masks is going to just lead to avoidable deaths other places in societies fight against this disease.

4409,"DUTCH RESEARCHERS FIRST TO FIND COVID-19 ANTIBODIES: REPORT By Zack Newmark on March 14, 2020 - 11:53

A team of ten scientific researchers from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and Utrecht University say they are the first in the world to discover an antibody capable of fending off an infection by the Covid-19 variant of coronavirus. The discovery could lead to an antiviral medication, and the ability for people to test themselves at home for the presence of the virus.

“I am too old to jump on a table,” said cellular biology professor Frank Grosveld to Erasmus Magazine. Their article is undergoing a peer review by other researchers on the online platform BioRxiv, and they believe it well then be published by top science journal Nature.

""Here we report a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV),"" the researchers state in their academic paper's abstract. This is the SARS-2 virus, which causes coronavirus induced disease 19, or Covid-19 for short.

They claim the antibody they found ""neutralizes"" the virus, and ""offers the potential to prevent and/or treat COVID-19, and possibly also other future emerging diseases in humans caused by viruses from the Sarbecovirus subgenus.""

""As far as we know, this is the very first antibody that blocks the infection,"" Grosveld explained to the magazine. ""Finding something like this is very rare,"" he said.

Their research would not necessarily lead to a vaccine, but rather a new medicine that could be used to treat those infected with the current coronavirus strain. It could be developed far faster than a vaccine, but would need months of testing, he stated, adding that it would also be more expensive to produce than a vaccine.

""We are now trying to get a pharmaceutical company on board – which is looking promising, by the way – that can produce the antibody on a large scale as a medicine,"" Grosveld said.

""If you were to take this as a patient, it is expected – only an expectation right now – that the infection will be stopped. And so it can give the patient an opportunity to recover,"" he told the magazine.",,/r/europe/comments/fiia9h/dutch_researchers_first_to_find_covid19/fki8lfg/,iamwhoiamwho,1584214180

The idea is not to track every infection but to limit the infection spread by social distancing. Measures are chosen so that the spread stays below the health care system maximum capacity. You also can expect some amount of deaths because too drastic measures will cost too much money and as healthcare runs on money it would mean more deaths elsewhere.

Korea and China have walled themselves in and wait for vaccine or some sort of miracle to happen. They can't really open borders as long as the pandemic is wild around the planet.

	Emergency doctors in Italy, the European epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, were this week given guidance on “catastrophe medicine”. As the number of patients requiring intensive care balloons and hospitals run out of intensive care beds, doctors were instructed to “aim to guarantee intensive treatment to patients with the greatest chance of therapeutic success”.

With the grim task of selecting patients unlikely to survive, Italy’s health authorities have pleaded with the countries’ friends and allies for emergency supplies. On Thursday, they finally arrived — from Shanghai. The China Eastern flight brought a medical team and 31 tonnes of supplies including ventilators.

Beijing’s gesture has reinforced a perceived lack of support from Europe, compounded by a communications blunder by the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde, who implied on Thursday it was no longer her job to keep Italy in the euro.

When Italy asked for urgent medical supplies under a special European crisis mechanism no EU country responded. Fearful of its own shortages, Germany initially banned the export of medical masks and other protective gear. 3M, a producer, said the German restrictions had made it impossible to supply the Italian market. Berlin subsequently relaxed the export rules, but then Austria closed its borders to people arriving from Italy unless they could prove they were virus-free.

The rebuffs are nourishing resentment that Italy has been abandoned by its European friends. It is a perception that has taken root over a decade, of a currency union that lacks collective solidarity and stifles growth as Italy confronted migrant flows from Africa and the Middle East. This, in turn, has fuelled the rise of Eurosceptic nationalists such as far-right firebrand Matteo Salvini.

“It is back to the future, where Italy is left on its own,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome. “It was the case with the eurozone crisis, then the migrant crisis of 2015-16 and now the coronavirus crisis. It is the same old story and the political implications could be massive.”

As Rome’s anger mounted this week, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, tried to reassure Italians the EU was on their side, promising flexibility over EU deficit rules and a €25bn investment fund for fighting the crisis across the bloc. But the warm words from Brussels were soon drowned out by a message from Frankfurt.

Christine Lagarde’s comment that it was not the ECB’s job to “close the spreads” between 10-year Italian government bonds and German Bunds — a measure of the risk differential between the two sovereign debts — caused it to spike by 60 basis points, the biggest daily increase on record. The FTSE MIB, Milan’s blue-chip stock index, plummeted 17 per cent, its biggest daily drop, out-slumping other equity markets on a terrible day for investors around the world.

“Italy needed help and it has been given a slap in the face,” said Matteo Salvini, leader of the nationalist League party who said he would look into seeking compensation from the central bank.

He added: “The only help that has come from Europe has been to cause the collapse of the stock market and to make the spread go crazy. Yesterday Italy lost €68bn of savings.”

Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, attacked Ms Lagarde as an “evidently inadequate” ECB president.

“In 2012 faced with an economic crisis the Italian Mario Draghi used a bazooka to calm it,” she said. “Today his French successor Christine Lagarde decided to use a boomerang, with a surreal statement that caused the collapse of the stock market.”

Hours after Ms Lagarde spoke — the ECB a day later insisted it “stood ready to do more” — Sergio Mattarella, Italy’s president, unusually spoke out to say that a country in crisis expected “initiatives of solidarity and not obstacles to action”.

“The job of the central bank should not be to hinder but to help such measures by creating favourable financial conditions for them,” said prime minister Giuseppe Conte.

The spike in the spread — a popular metric in Italy since the eurozone debt crisis — reinforced a narrative that when a crisis hits, the country is on its own.

Ms Lagarde’s comments appeared to undo the work of her Italian predecessor, Mario Draghi, who was instrumental in restoring confidence that Italy could remain in the eurozone, while echoing the sentiments of hawkish German policymakers, said Ms Tocci.

It did not help that Ms Lagarde’s explosive remarks about “lo spread” — as the Italians call it — won approval from Jens Weidmann, president of Germany’s Bundesbank.

The EU could yet put in place a co-ordinated rescue package for Italy, including Italian bond-buying by the ECB.

But Ms Lagarde’s comments had exposed “an underlying vulnerability in the eurozone centred on Italy’s precarious economic position”, said Kenneth Wattret, chief European economist at IHS Markit. To fix the economic damage of the severe travel disruptions and quarantine restrictions would require the ECB to monetise Italy’s debt or a bailout, he said.

“It is the elephant in the room and this crisis is bringing it home because Italy is now at the heart of the crisis in Europe,” Mr Wattret added.",,/r/europe/comments/fiie64/italy_wonders_where_europes_solidarity_is_as/fkh9891/,am3l1a,1584192730

For instance we know that S. Korea has performed something like 200,000 tests whereas the USA has performed &lt; 10,000 for a population six times greater. This will skews numbers.

(2) As a knock-on effect of this we know that, for instance, S. Korea has managed the containment/mitigation part of the spread differently precisely because they did more testing. No city-wide lock-downs for them, lots more self-isolating. You need to take this into consideration.

(3) Different countries deployed different counter-measures and did so at different stages in the disease's progress. This will further skews numbers.

I am not comparing you to Soviets. ""**If** Nazis were worse and you are saying you were just as bas as Soviets, it could be considered downplaying Nazi crimes"". It's hypothetical and it's general ""you"". Fucking hell you are so fucking dense...

&gt;No it isn't.

Neither is me saying Nazis were worse.

&gt;Since I'm not claiming that Nazis were lesser evil. 

You don't need to claim they were lesser evil. I fucking explained it.

&gt;Fact remains that commies killed millions of people as much as Nazis did, the difference is that they did it in slower and more sadistic way.

Number of deaths isn't same and ""slower more sadistic way"" is just your opinion. Also you consider scale to be irrelevant but you care about how sadistic it was? There is no logic in argumentation, it's purely based on emotions.

&gt;Your morality is quite sickening if you think USSR was not as evil as Nazis given that both have millions of dead innocent people on their hands.

If it is sickening to you, that's your problem. My morality is logical, consisent, nuanced.

&gt;Yes I would.

Your people survived half a century of Soviet rule. Significant portion of Jews was killed during Holocaust which lasted fraction of that and if Nazis won potentially all Jews would be dead. How can you say that's equal? I find that sickening.

That being said, while there may not be much of a danger using old filters, they don't necessarily have to be completely effective either, even if they were properly sealed. That is mainly because the adhesive holding the HEPA filter and other components in the casing deteriorates over time, which may lower overall effectiveness. How much is hard to tell because you'd have to cut it apart to really find out.

My GF is American, and her family still lives in the U.S.. I've been to the U.S. dozens of times and have quite a bunch of friends there. My impression is very different from your description.

Your statement:""Secondly, I have no sympathy for people who choose to be uninsured"" is pretty harsh IMO. There are plenty of people in the U.S. who simply can't afford the outrageously expensive health care insurance.

The big question then becomes: how does these uninsured people not being tested affect everyone else?

They will not show up as confirmed infected when they aren't tested, making everyone else feel like there is less of a threat of also getting infected because the numbers are down. That's spreading a false sense of security.

It's not as if the small number of tests that have been done in the U.S. so far gives a realistic picture of the number of infected people there, but denying people a test will not make things better for the rest of the U.S. population.

What one wants to try initially to do is to contain the thing, bring the rate of spread down to the point where the thing burns itself out.

But if that fails, then the goal becomes slowing down the thing spread out when patients become ill.

Once someone gets the disease, at least in the short term, they're immune to it.

If one fails to contain the outbreak, let it burn itself out, then it will spread until the high frequency of immune people in society — those who survived it — is high enough to limit the spread to the point where the total number of active cases starts shrinking.

When you hear them talking about that, it's just what happens after containment plans fail, what will ultimately limit the outbreak.

5190,"&gt; Not because of the virus, but because of the economy and **food**.

My guess is that farmers are probably some of the least-affected people.  They're going to be out of cities.  They also aren't gonna be holed up.

More-importantly, the deaths that are happening are disproportionately among the elderly, retired people.  It sucks that they're dying early, sure, but they are not blowing a hole in the economy.

The shortages that you see on shelves are not there because of production problems — well, aside from masks — but because people are grabbing them off the shelves quickly.  It's an annoyance, maybe, but they'll keep getting restocked.  People are not burning calories faster than before, and we don't run at the bare limit of what the world can produce, which is why you don't hear about famines in the world.

Even if the world somehow had all food vanish — which it won't — food is, for most, not that urgent of a concern.  Your body stores fat so that it has calories to run on.  There are about 7700 calories in a kg of fat.  An adult male might burn 2000 calories a day.  Most people would probably be healthier if they lost some fat.  I've fasted for over a week before for the heck of it, and (obese) people have done so for over a year.  Sure, we're using to eating three meals a day, but it's not like it's a physical necessity.

Countries maintain food stockpiles on top of that.  Cargo ships will keep going (in fact, as I recall the world currently has an excess of cargo shipping.)

The world isn't going to just stop going to work.  Countries are going to keep having people work.  Even if the infection rate hits 100% in a country, people can still go to work amid the coughing — in fact, then there's no reason for any quarantine measures. Yes, there are some people (restaurant employees, airline employees)  who are going to be idled, but most people aren't.  A lot of retirees and a few older workers will die early.  But the world will still be generally producing what it does.

This means,  Schools, universities, all events, recreational activity places such as restaurants, bars and other recreational gathering points are closed.
If infringed, the law can reinforce the measures taken by the government (Starting from yesterday 13th March 12pm until the 3th April).

In regards to commercial activities : Grocery stores and Pharmacies are open as usual (Weekdays and Weekends). Other commercial/selling businesses are open only on weekdays, delivery is still running.

For all other work activities, working at home for those who can, is strongly advised and if necessary reinforced by law. Public transportation is still running but also they strongly advise not to use them, walking and taking the bike is advised, same for the car but it should not be your first choice if you have an alternative. 

For the economic problem that this all will suppose,  they have adopted 10 measures since the 6th March to help business and employees. For example : having access to “Unemployment allowance by major cause” (Self-employed workers are also being taken into account in the allowance.) More info on the Source.

For all the Belgian or Resident workers in Belgium, here’s a link for more information of the “Unemployment allowance” or “Chomage Temporaire” for the coronavirus at l’ONEM :

5321,"It's a bit daft to assume Napoleon accepting the Frankfurt proposals would have ended the wars. The five truces before hadn't ended the wars, and a peace where the British diplomat misunderstood London's position is even more unlikely. Napoleon accepting the terms wouldn't have kept him his throne, and at most the diplomatic confusion in London would have only bought him a few months to prepare for the invasion of France.

Perhaps Napoleon could have pulled a Frederick the Great with the extra time to train his men, but I doubt it. Apart from the military and the lower class, France was very tired of Napoleon at that point, and half of the talented French marshals had either already betrayed Napoleon to save their own thrones (Murat, Bernadotte) or was preparing to betray Napoleon (Marmont). The marshals Napoleon had with him in 1814 *unanimously* asked him to abdicate when they heard Paris was captured, and *refused* Napoleon when he prepared to march on Paris. Napoleon's administration was talented, not loyal; at the end of the day, only Davout was truly devoted.

The drama of Napoleon and Metternich is also misleading, since Napoleon and Metternich had already discussed what the terms would be before they were proposed. What Napoleon did was not reject them, but delay too long in accepting them. He asked for peace on the Frankfurt terms in December 1813, when they were proposed to him in November.

&gt;Unfortunately Napoleon refused proposal and Austria joined Coalition with almost 300 000 more troops, that resulted with Battle of Leipzig and that was real end of Napoleon.

I believe it's one of the oldest abstract maps in ever made. It shows a clear overview of the roads of the empire, so you can easily pick which route to take. 

Notice the little N-like bends inbetween routes? If you look ""east"" (geographically I guess that would be south-southeast) of Rome you see 2 roads going to the same town: 1 route with 1 bend, and 1 route with 3 bends. That bend indicates a resting post for messengers, where you could take shelter or simply switch horses (because yours is already exhausted) and continue your journey. IIRC emperor Augustus had them installed every so many miles.

So even though some lines are longer than others, if that shorter one has a few resting places while the longer line has none, it's a safe bet the longer line is actually the faster route. Really handy for travels!

Look up the entire map if you're interested! It encompasses the entire Empire under Augustus (so not the peak of Roman territory, but pretty close).

Because the act - murder is done in both cases. Both become murderers.

&gt;Two millions and twenty millions are both millions, yet one is way higher than other. And then there is also time scale and resulting rate.

Two million? You clearly meant at least 6 million (for the Stalinist period) to 8.1 million (for a period ending in 1937) to 20 million to 61 million (for the period 1917-1987).

You need to be absolute out of your mind to think USSR wasn't on pair with Nazis when it came to body count.

&gt;What I like or don't like has nothing to do with this. This isn't personal.

Yet you made it personal given how defensive you are in trying to prove that Nazis were ""worse"".

&gt;I am not downplaying Soviet war crimes. I am pointing out that Nazis did even worse. One might argue that by equating them you are downplaying Nazi war crimes.

And yet here we are, with you trying to prove that Nazis were worse.

But not only least amount of casualties for this virus itself but every other disease and health risk too. This is a complex equation which includes economic factors among others.

There are three ways this could have ended. First is contagion, but it failed. It's now pandemic and there's no way stopping it. The second is to invent a vaccine but that's only a dream at the moment. It might take a year. The third is to face the virus as it is. After many enough have had the disease its spread ends because there are no new hosts for it available. This probably takes a few months, half a year or so. Prepare for that, prepare to be ill at some point - for most of us it will be like a flu but some will die. You have to participate in slowing the spread down so that the hospital capacity is adequate through the whole ordeal.

The epidemic hasn't ended in China, Taiwan or Korea. These countries are in the same state UK was before it had its first case: there's an epidemic raging elsewhere but not here. They're just blocked. If they start letting people in the epidemy will start there again, like it did in Europe. These countries will stay in that state for at least half a year.

That said, the Prime Minister did decree a 'state of epidemic danger', introducing certain precautions:

  


\* Border control is temporarily reinstated, for 10 days since the 15th March; they will remain open for cargo movement, but with only certain passages being open \^((conjecture:) \^(likely) \^(the) \^(pre-Schengen) \^(ones) \^(where) \^(the) \^(infrastructure) \^(is) \^(already) \^(there)),

\* Foreigners that are not already residents are not allowed entry into Poland,

\* Polish citizens and foreign residents returning from abroad are to undergo a 14-day quarantine in their homes;

\* The international plane and train routes will be suspended on the night of 14th/15th March; the exception will be granted to charter routes to allow Polish citizens reentry, however the procedures on arrival will be stricter,

\* Shops within shopping malls are to be closed starting from the same night, with exceptions for general stores, apothecaries and washing centers; shops and service providers outside of malls are unaffected (the ban on Sunday operations still applies, as do the previous cautionary measures like shutting down schools, cinemas, theatres etc.),

\* Restaurants etc. are to be delivery and takeaway only,

\* All assemblies, including religious ones, are restricted to 50 people maximum.

No, it isn't. Or well, if you are referring here to (if I have understood correctly) the Russian interpretation where WW2 was only the events that happened after Germany attacked the Soviet Union (the Great Patriotic war), then yes. But as in general, definitely no.

World war two started on 1.9.1939 when Germany invaded Poland. Soviet Union invaded 16 days later.  And a week before Germany attacked, the Soviets and Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.

For what it's worth, I don't think the EU as a centralised unitary state would work, I'm just saying that in an emergency situation of this scale it is better to handle it at the highest level of government, and have that federal government not be overruled by ""lower"" governments. That's what we had in Belgium until yesterday: the federal government could only really advise the local authorities to do things, the federal government didn't have sufficient powers within all the necessary societal domains. Now that the ""federal fase"" has been announced the federal government has many more direct authority over the entire territory. It's a little simplistic (belgian consitutional law is massively complex), but we are effectively a unitary state again in some regards as long as the crisis lasts.

I never talked about ""forcible centralisation"". Again, I think the most workable sovereign EU would be a federation, not a unitary state, and not even an overly centralised federation either (there needs to be proper debate about what powers should be handeled on what level of government). I'm just saying it times of crisis such as now, things should be decided on the highest level possible, otherwise it's a clusterfuck.

5786,"&gt; The EU GDP per capita tracks the US GDP per capita reasonably well. Population growth is the main contributor to US GDP growth, not macroeconomic policy.

This is true. I should have said I was as talking about at Eurozone GDP per capita, not EU GDP per capita. My point was that Eurozone GDP per capita has been hobbled by the fact that the ECB disengaged quantitative easing earlier. The Eurozone has been a basket case of the last decade.

Looking EU GDP per capita as a whole hides the weakness in the Eurozone because Poland, the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Croatia and the Czech Republic aren’t in the Eurozone and weren’t as affected by the ECB’s actions. Looking at the EU GDP growth as a whole also obfuscates the comparison because it includes lots of poorer Eastern European countries that should be expected to have higher than average growth because they’re already poorer.

The more telling comparison is between the US performance vs the Eurozone comparison. That’s the comparison between the central bank policies of the US and ECB between sets of fully developed countries.


&gt; Japan is also labeled some kind of economic basket case, yet it is also keeping its relative prosperity with the US. The major difference is that Japan experienced a huge bubble during the 80s which is also reflected in the graph above.

Japan has all sorts of specific problems peculiar to Japan. They never had a financial reckoning and instead kept on pushing money into what became a zombie banking system after the 1980s.",,/r/europe/comments/fhzc4w/in_italy_government_and_opposition_are_united_for/fkevrv6/,JSanchez504,1584121704

5803,"&gt; It is you who don't understand it, if the DNC wanted they could give the nomination to Kamala in the second round through super delegates.


You’re missing 3 things here. 

First, superdelegates don’t have the power to choose a third candidate. The Superdelegates only make up 16% of total delegates and have 16% of the voting power. The Superdelegates can’t give the nomination to anyone else. A potential nominee would still need 35% of the remaining pledged delegates to secure a nomination even if 100% of the 16% of delegates who are superdelegates went to that candidate. The superdelegates can’t vote in the first round unless one candidate already has a majority of the pledged delegates. What’s going to happen is that Biden will already have a majority of the pledged delegates so the Superdelegates will be able to vote in the first round between Biden and Sanders, and they will vote for Biden anyway. 

Second, the superdelegates are not the DNC. The Democratic National Committee is itself a small normal political committee. The superdelegates are 775 mostly all elected Democratic politicians in the federal congress along with elected Democratic governors. These are the same people who are already endorsing Biden. Even if they had the power to make someone besides Biden the candidate, most of them have already Biden.

Third, even if the superdelegates had the power to chose a third candidate, and even if they wanted to choose a third candidate, they still wouldn’t do it because that would be political suicide for the Democratic Party. Tens of millions of people are voting in the Democratic primary right now and it would be politically disastrous for the party elites to chose and random person that nobody voted for. You realize the Democratic Party is called the ”DEMOCRATIC” party.

This level of occupancy is moderate and was actually much higher a few weeks back.

For heard immunity you need some 60%. Say that the UK can manage 10 times of what China does at any given time in terms of total cases, that still means just 0.3% of the population in a 6 week cycle.

5993,"&gt;It’s more deadly in Italy, not here. You are running at 6.7% compared to our just over 1%. That suggests the Italian health system is overwhelmed. We have to delay this into warmer months or the same will happen to the NHS.

You are letting the virus running wild, if you keep doing that your hospitals will overwhelmed well before summer. Your doing nothing to delay it.

Your prime minister is letting thousand of your people die and the NHS be crippled so business can go on.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/fhyedg/concern_over_government_plan_to_allow_most_of/fke7jso/,albadellasera,1584107126
5994,"&gt; Can the doctor stay at home when ill people are flooding the hospital?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And why should people that are in need for care (like old or disabled) suddenly stop being disabled?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I agree there are jobs that should stay at home after recent news. But at the same time there are also jobs that can't stay at home in those 2 weeks and are probably even more important during that time.

It's something that will likely be dealt with as in Italy: the Italian organisation for doctors has recommended to the government that people over a certain age will no longer be admitted to hospital (or treated) when they catch the corona virus.

That sounds harsh, but it's basic triage: those with the best chance at survival when treated will be treated in liu of those with a small chance at survival.

One of my neighbours is taking care of people with severe disabilities. If she can't medicate, treat, feed, change and clean them, they will die. If she isn't allowed to leave her house, they are in trouble. If they catch the virus, she isn't allowed to go to them, in prt because she is maried and has children herself, in part because she would then risk infecting the other patients with very weak immune systems that she cares for.

Is that hard?

Yes.

But what is the alternative if hospitals are already at full capacity and the healthcare system is about to collapse? That's the current situation in Italy, and it won't be long before things start to turn in a similar direction in our neck of the woods as well.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/fhxe6b/coronavirus_three_german_states_and_bavaria_to/fke7k4t/,Thanalas,1584107133
5995,"Ya, I worry though because many in the US want to emulate such a system and there is no telling if it would scale from 6 million to 330 million.  Government bloat is a real thing, and I have seen how our government handles healthcare.  It certainly isn't the worst, but I would never voluntarily get on Medicaid or go with the VA.  It is complicated.  A lot of Europeans want to believe only the rich get great healthcare here, but that is a myth.  Far too many get screwed, I am just not a fan of hyperbole.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fhv8l0/to_everybody_in_healthcare_stay_strong/fke7k5e/,JakeAAAJ,1584107133
