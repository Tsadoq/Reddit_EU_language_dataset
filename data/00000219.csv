17,"&gt; Bij het ademen wordt het meeste werk gedaan door het middenrif, een laag spier en vezelweefsel die de borstholte van de buikholte scheidt. De ribben vormen de bovenkant van de kooi, waarin hart en longen liggen, en het middenrif is de bodem.

&gt; Als we van bovenaf op het middenrif zouden kijken, zouden we een grote vezelachtige massa zien, die met spiervezels verbonden is aan de onderste zes ribben.

&gt; Bij inademing trekken deze spiervezels zich samen, waardoor het middenrif platter wordt. Dit vergroot de inhoud van de longen, die via luchtpijp, neus en mond lucht opzuigen. In de longen gaat de lucht naar de longblaasjes, waar de uitwisseling van zuurstof en kooldioxide plaatsvindt. De hemoglobine in het bloed neemt de zuurstof op en de rode bloedlichaampjes brengen het kooldioxide terug naar de longblaasjes om door de longen uitgescheiden te worden. Uitademen gebeurt door ontspannen van de spieren, waardoor het middenrif omhoog komt en de lucht uit de longen wordt gedrukt.

&gt; Net als elke andere spier ontvangt het middenrif voor het samentrekken en ontspannen instructies van het zenuwstelsel. Dit gebeurt door de linker en rechter middenrifzenuwen. Vreemd genoeg komen deze zenuwen van hoog uit het ruggenmerg en moeten daarom een vrij lange weg afleggen. Deze zenuwen kunnen door ziekte of verwonding beschadigd raken.",Republiek der 17 verenigde Nederlanden,/r/europe/comments/9aig72/another_copypasta_map_showing_the_date_and_method/e4wh5eu/,Grofgeschut,1535346580

37,"What's interesting, and a tad ironic in light of the Nazi Regime, is that European Jews were often protected from the ire of the population by the nobility and royalty, often due to the same financial interests which caused them to invite Jews into the country or employ them in certain occupations to begin with. And as time went by, Jews who have risen to prominence under their circumstances have also started using soft power to defend themselves. 

It was in fact the dictatorial nature of the European kingdoms which enabled various rulers or clergymen to often intervene in pogroms by sending in the Guard to halt them before they got out of hand, or keeping watch over the Ghettos in order to both keep the Jews as isolated subjects but also to prevent mobs from interfering with them as long as the Monarch has need of them.

An absence of total Jewish genocide in a given European country is therefore not reflective of a population's wishes or restraint, since these countries were not democratic. Treatment of Jews was only indicative of a singular person's opinion, the one who possessed the ""Divine Right"" to command the Guards and the Armies. Which is why Jewish history in any given European nation could fluctuate so wildly between prosperity and decimation every time a Monarch died or had a change of heart. And eventually, there would be powerful Jews ( Rothschilds, Enterprise Owners, etc.. ) who could even influence nobles directly to refrain from harming Jewish communities for a time.

For example, the conditions of Jews in the German Empire were entirely dependent on [the relationship of the community with Kaiser Wilhelm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_James_Simon#Biography) and his own attitude towards Jewish subjects, more than anything it had to do with what a Bavarian peasant wanted.

&gt;""Though a reserved man, he played an influential role in the German society, especially by his participation at a regular roundtable with Emperor Wilhelm II. Simon and other invitees like Albert Ballin and Carl Fürstenberg as well as Emil and Walther Rathenau discussed economic life and tried to give the emperor an understanding of a Jewish perspective on social issues. Their close relationship with the erratic ruler was seen critical by Zionist contemporaries and the circle's participants were later mocked as the ""Emperor's Jews"" (Kaiserjuden) by Chaim Weizmann.""

Or look at the history of expulsions, even. An expulsion was almost always preceded by a populist pogrom in which significant percentages of Jews were killed, yet those pogroms weren't stopped because the majority wanted them to stop. They stopped whenever the ruling monarch, whether due to religious doctrine or other reason decided to summon the Guards and stop the killings so that the Jews could be sacked in an orderly manner and then deported. But what do you think would've happened if there wasn't any dictator in charge? That the peasants would just spontaneously decide that the 500 Jews they killed so far was sufficient, and then started delegating assistants to escort all the remaining Jews into ships? They would've just kept murdering until there was nobody left.

This theme can be seen throughout the duration of Medieval history. Whenever Jews were being massacred, they were only spared by appealing to the local ruler, who usually had vested financial interests in the matter as well. So in summary, it wasn't your average European who was the reason that not all Jews and Gypsies in Europe were killed. It was specifically the European ruling classes, a minority. and when Hitler got into power, we finally witnessed what happens when a ruler is just as determined to kill Jews just as much as the next pogrom participant.",,/r/europe/comments/9adsmt/colorized_photo_of_the_1936_nuremburg_rally/e4whmcf/,Questiori,1535347332

49,"That's stupid fucking logic holy shit. Abducting and lockig people away is terrible but the  state can do it with due process too.

The simple reason that capital punishment is asinine is because it's a punishment which is purely retributive and not preventive.  It is simply put more costly to execute a man then to incarcerate them for life because locking people up is actually quite cheap.

Research also finds that above a certain limit there is actually no deterrent any more. The moment a crime carries more than 20 years you essentially plan on ""not getting caught"" you don't weigh the punishment anymore and assume you aren't going to get caught so 20, 30, life, or death don't matter any more. Life imprisonment does not function as a deterrent but as a means to keep people out of society forever which is why some countries implement this the right way with the actual maximum sentence being 20 in theory but after 20 they're going to assess if you are still a danger to society and if so they can indefinitely extent your sentence.

I'm a selfish bastard like anyone else and my primary impetus is keeping the streets safe from crime; seeing criminals suffer doesn't provide me the same satisfaction as being able to go about my business with the least amount of fear hence I believe that the criminal system should have zero elements of retribution and should purely be designed around he singular goal of reducing the number of crimes and capital punishment just wastes money that could be used on a more effective system.",De korthaar verdient niets dan den pijn des hellevuurs,/r/europe/comments/9aig72/another_copypasta_map_showing_the_date_and_method/e4whx23/,UseTheProstateLuke,1535347822

Fortunately gas power plants have around 60% and oil plants have 55-60%.

Battery charging efficiency is around 99% and inverters have efficiency around 97%. Dont know where you are getting 80%.

Diesel engines have peak efficiency 35% but average efficiency is 25%. Gasoline has 30/20%.

200,"&gt;Due to the fact that some idiot decided to “export democracy” in Africa and Middle East...

This migrant crisis coming out of Libya started long after Qaddafi died.  Getting involved in Libya was a stupid thing to do, but the central Mediterranean migrant crisis started when the former ruling party in Italy had the stupid idea of creating “Mare Nostrum” in 2013, which created a huge pull factor for migrants wanting to sneak into Europe.  The migrants (most not being Libyan), chose to go to Libya so they could get a free ride to Europe.

&gt; the closest SAFE port is not in Tripoli (for example) but most likely in Italy.

Then the PDI did nothing with them afterwards.  They didn’t get detained or deported or anything.  No deals were made with third countries to detain the migrants until they could be sent home.  They were left on their own recognizance.  Many left Italy to other countries, which pissed Italy’s neighbors off.  It took *years* for the PDI to finally do *anything* to stem the flow of migrants, and likely only did so because they knew they were going to lose badly in the next election (which they did).

&gt; and the good answer is “let’s give them a place to stay and some money, because this is what humans deserve!”... so you’re basically importing a lot of desperate persons and paying them to do nothing until Europe decides what to do. 

This is a terrible idea.  Do you have any idea how many people want to live in Europe?  Who is going to pay for an indefinite number of welfare cases?  Minimum wage citizens have a right to be pissed about that.  They don’t want their tax dollars going to taking care of hoards of non-citizens who illegally entered the country when they are not doing so well themselves.  

&gt;The good news is that on the last crisis (unbelievably) Albania responded that was willing to help those poor souls waiting since the beginning of time on a boat that couldn’t touch land, because no one was willing to help the people that was carrying.

No one is “willing” to help because they are already stretched too thin as it is.  This decade has brought millions of migrants to Europe.  Countries are sick of it.  Even Sweden and Germany had to say “enough” at the height of the migrant crisis.  There is no end to the amount of migrants that want to go to Europe.  

I guess the upside to Albania taking in some of them is that it would be a deterrent for some migrants to make the journey in the first place.  You know they didn’t want to end up in Albania, and since Albania isn’t in the Schengen zone, they can’t as easily hightail it to Sweden, Germany, or some other welfare heavy state.

International law needs to change with the times.  Italy can’t be responsible for every migrant who wants to take a rickety boat to Europe.  By all means, save the migrants who are in trouble, but send them straight home.  That would end the stream of migrants almost entirely.  If the migrants won’t tell you where home is, detain them until they do.  If the migrants country won’t take them back, threaten to cut off aid.  Italy (and the EU) is going to have to be the “bad guy” at some point.

[Productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity) is the GDP per hour worked. So the fact that the French get more time off wouldn't make them less productive because only hours worked are part of the equation.

268,"I picked the comparison to the NRA with care. Just as with guns it's surprisingly easy to prove that the *main* factor isn't the lax law. Gun ownership rates and homicide rates don't actually correlate. In the US you're more likely to be murdered without a firearm than to be murdered at all in Germany. So *main* issue is somewhere else. 

That, however, is only relevant if we're wondering about priorities. Yes, when it comes to road safety the speedlimit is by no means a priority - more vigorously enforcing existing rules via higher fines and more controls and maybe tests for older drivers would probably do safe a lot more people. 

But that doesn't change that it's very likely to save a few lives if a speedlimit were implemented. 

It's also obvious that someone driving at 300kph would be a huge danger. It's just that there's not many drivers *that* extreme, so their death toll is rather limited. Given how few people actually drive that fast however, I also don't see why removing that right would be a problem. I mean, very few people would want walk around the city with a pet tiger, but we don't let them do that either because it would be stupid. 

I'm even saying that we really need a speedlimit at 130 - the case for that would mostly environmental - but I really don't get why there's not at the very least a regulation that makes it clear that driving above 200kph or so isn't acceptable.

Btw, most of the Autobahn is actually without a speedlimit. [Two thirds](https://www.n-tv.de/auto/Mehrheit-fuer-Tempolimit-auf-Autobahnen-article16152446.html) didn't have any regulation in 2008 and a significant portion of the regulated part only has temporary signs. IIrc the unregulated portion has decresased a bit recently, but it's still above 50%. Your perception is likely a bit skewed since speedlimits are usually where there's many drivers on on the road.

324,"&gt; You are far off,more comparable example would be Luxemburg adopting German or Dutch,and then you could say what you said and yes,you could say they are same nation with cultural difference.

So this is the basis for your entire argument - same language = same nation??? 


You see, I don't understand what do you mean when you say that Croats and Serbs are ""exact same south slavs"" or ""are absolutely same nation"", so I'm asking you for some examples so I can calibrate or gauge your claim.       

 Are you also saying that there is no difference between the Dutch, the Germans and Luxembourgers besides their languages? Are they the ""exact same germanic people""?
I notice you ignored my question about Jamaicans and Irish. Are they the same nation? I mean, they both adopted English.   
Are the Irish the same nation as the English?    


&gt; Only problem is that 3 nations of different religion,speak,same,freaking,absolute same,language.
That cant happen on its own if they are not connected as one freaking group of people.   

But it didn't happen on it's own! A number of linguists, poets, writers and politicians throughout 19th and 20th century pushed for creation of a single language for all south Slavs. They didn't always have the same motivation for this, as they followed different ideologies: Illyrian movement, Croatian National Revival, Greater Serbian irredentism, Yugoslav nationalism... 

Most of the 20th century South Slavs were a part of the same country so that further helped the convergence of these languages. 


Before all of that, before a small number of romantic dreamers/ideologues and two different dictatorships, south slavic languages were diversifying, and Croats spoke 3 main dialects/languages: chakavian, kaykavian and shtokavian. Each dialect had dozens of local speeches of varying levels of mutual intelligibility. Some of the oldest Croatian literary works were in chakavian, and before shtokavian became the standard, most Croats in Croatia spoke chakavian and kaykavian. And these dialects survive to this day. 
So what do you call a Croat whose native language is Kaykavian Croatian (which shares a low degree of mutual intelligibility with Shtokavian Croatian, and is in fact closer to Slovenian than to Serbian) who learned standard Croatian in school and uses it in professional settings but talks in his native dialect/language at home? Does learning ""Serbo-Croatian"" make him a ""Serbo-Croat""?                                      

&gt; Have no clue what you are pointing out with this tough.

It's a straightforward question. How do those 3 ethnicities (Slovenes, Macedonians, Bulgarians) compare to Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs? Are they also ""absolutely the same"" or is there something different about them?     

&gt; I had some talk with couple of you today,and same shit happened,while they claimed about some ""kingdom of Croatia"" in 1000 AD nobody gave evidence apart some wiki bullshit that even dont have reliable links as refferences.

You want to know how we're different (besides religion), right? What evidence would you find adequate?

338,"Sounds like social liberalism more than anything else. I'm unfamiliar with the term social capitalism. Being attractive or unattractive isn't systemic and can't really be changed, so I would say that it doesn't really make sense as a definition of equality in common use. I think most people would say that society is relatively 'equal' if the only inequality was purely situational and not systemic. I also wouldn't say that most people would describe incels as being treated unequally, to use one of your examples. The idea that market forces will somehow lead to equality in the sense of Incels finding girlfriends and men not killing themselves is kind of laughable, and probably not a generally accepted view. So while I agree that communists don't see this as an issue (except for the suicide rate, but that's another discussion), I don't think the majority of people do either, which is really what we were talking about.

*if we are not equipped to understand the ideas being critiques, we are in no way able to defend ourselves*. Sure, but this is a failure of society, not the ideas themselves. Also I'm not entirely sure about this idea of an intentionally malevolent Freud. Lastly, all I can say on Psychoanalysis is that, from my experience, it is still an active field within psychology departments and makes up several required units in both the bachelor and master degrees, so I couldn't in good conscious call it 'dead'.

Corelations are evidence but don't imply a causal relationship, that's basics. OK, but then everything leading up to this point including nationalism itself is 'societal aids' seeing as there isn't anything that doesn't somehow destabalise an existing system without completely replacing all of its elements, which would make your use of the term as critique in this particular context rather redundant. Society needs people to sustain itself, but a gross increase is in no way required, nor is a decline unacceptable within margins. Rationalism has not really proven to be all that useful in proving the existence of God (which is something most modern rationalists would probably say isn't provable). Your darwinian idea of success is rather reductionist and not a definition I would agree with. A collectivist society would take that duty away from the individual ask whether your actions worked to improve quality of life for individuals, ensure the procreative ability of other, etc, etc. Ok, that there's nothing flawed in the current hegemony is something I fundamentally disagree with, immigration facilitates growth of a society, and they tend to have more children, so by your argument, immigration is positive for society as long as children are being born. Just because people are having children doesn't mean we shouldn't critique them, your standpoint really sounds nonsensical. Hitler ran an incredibly sufficient society, had he not lost the war, who knows what might have happened. By that logic, his society would have to be free from critique so long as children were being born. Your metrics of success are incredibly primitive and dangerous. Finally, I still disagree that it does nothing to advise a replacement.

All I'm doing is analysing trends. There is necessarily a world view from being a conscious being, this implies a rudimentary normative system aka an ideology. Immigration hasn't increased because of neo Marxism. Its liberalism and humanism that have created a climate of globalism following the decolonisation period. Wanting to dethrone the cultural hegemony through critique and cultural diffusion adapting the hegemony are parallel processes, not causative...

We dispose of bad ideas. Atheism merely describes the dethroning of theological metaphysics. There's no failure of procreation, it is a demographic decline that is reproduced in all evolving industrial economies. Look at demographic trends in China, India or Eastern Europe. Their industrialisation, progress and demographic decline go hand in hand. To say that this is caused by atheism is, again, an error of viewing correlation as causation. 'swathes of white people that hate themselve' do you really not view this as utterly sensationalist? White guilt is overblown. Seeing that certain structures give white people a benefit and acknowledging this fact doesn't imply white guilt. The biggest thing that bothers me, and this is the reason we cannot fundamentally agree, is your completely primitive metric of measuring succes as a numbers game of kids. If we stopped having children all together then you might start to have some semblance of a valid point, but you are implicitly using a slippery slope fallacy in your argumentation.

Nobody is advocating open borders, where are you getting this crap? It's not the lefts opinion that every country should randomly open their borders, it's an obvious strawman. Anti natialism and saying that people should have less children due to ecological/structural reasons are not the same, and the former is far more niche than the latter (I've personally never met anyone that honestly believed anything like that, and it certainly isn't neo-marxist). ""basing their cores and ideas on forgery"". Come on. Your bias is blatantly obvious. To say that leftism is based on forgeries is terribly dishonest. Being a socialist doesn't involve identity politics. You're obviously basing your whole rhetoric on the American political system, which is inherently bat-shit crazy. Your attempt to pass off the idea of left wing dominance on forgeries is startlingly dishonest and reductionist.

Your primitive metric is no more objective than mine. Your denial of the existence of equal voting rights is nonsensical. Your manner of rhetoric is completely blind to your own inherent bias. All information is inherently framed in a certain way, but to imply that it is inherently dishonest because of it, and that you are the one shining example of somebody who is objective, is laughable.

Nationalism is an ideology that a cultural grouping should be materialised in the existance of a political unit. My usage of the term is the usage as it is normally used, yours is so broad as to defeat the purpose of having the term in the first place. I've already explained the concept of ideology as a necessity twice, I believe that it is well grounded, you may disagree but I haven't been convinced by your witchcall accusations of 'ad hoc' reasoning.

Globalisation is more than just a push of technology. It's the phenomenon of intensive expansion of communication between people's and the mixture of cultures. You really don't see how a global market economy facilitates free-trade dominance? Your last sentance is perhaps the most asinine you've written yet. I'm not sure if you are denying the idea of white supremacy in the slogan, or honestly believe that it implies that ""everything is supremacist"" (whatever the hell that's supposed to mean).",,/r/europe/comments/974bad/hungary_bans_gender_studies_from_state_run/e4vyaam/,JonoNexus,1535324772

Christian theocracy ruled death sentences for gays for a long time. I'm not sure what are even arguing about.

The point here being that Christianity doesn't execute homosexuals anymore whereas Islam still does. Arguing about what happened in the past is just whataboutism since we're only discussing the present.

&gt;Christian theocracy would do the same. Ones sticking with it does exactly that. Countries in Africa with Christian majority don't have religious rules to govern them so it's more than expected.

Christian African countries have a better track record with LGBT rights than Muslim African nations. Not all Muslim majority nations adhere to sharia either, though their legislation is heavily influenced by the doctrine of Islam.

&gt;Again, that's about if a country is ruled by religious laws or not. Same won't be different for ones ruled by strict Christian religious laws. We both know it hadn't when it was a thing.

Your argument relies on a fictional scenario where Christian theocracies exist, whereas mine is based on real world nations. We could spend hours discussing what a Christian theocracy would be like, but the fact is that sharia exists and is adopted by most Muslim majority nations.

&gt;I think you need to stick to a definition of reformation. If you're talking about ""the Reformation"", it hadn't brought anything better but many Protestants are and have been more radical than Catholics. Please, I mean, Puritans ruled the Britain weren't the best chunk and as conservative and backwards. Second half of the 20th century is the time when many Christian societies get better, thanks to that trend you're referring to. Before that, there was the social conservatism, réactionarism being the trend, Clerical fascists, KKK having literally millions of members, Christian terror, sectarianism, pogroms of Jews for being Jesus killers, etc. Seriously...

It's not like Christianity is unique in the amount of violence committed in its name. Sure, stuff happened where Christians did bad things. Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and etc all did bad things too in the name of their faith. What matters is the present, and at the present Christianity is a far more moral and gentle religion today, partly because of the Reformation.

&gt;Eh, no. It says examples for prophets, and guides but not perfect or anything.

A few people were killed for simply drawing a picture of Mohammed. If that isn't elevation to a semi-divine status, then I don't know what is.

&gt;Maybe there are different views on that, lol. By default, Orthodox are heretics, Eastern Christian churches are heretics or Protestants are heretics, Catholics are pagan and corrupt Popist heretics, etc. etc. Things don't work like that every time, sorry.

Christians are just Jewish heretics in essence, but I digress. Christian theology makes it very clear that you need to believe that Jesus died on the cross and that he was the son of God un order to be defined as a Christian. Just because that doesn't fit your personal interpretation of what a Christian is isn't really my problem.

&gt;That age stuff is pretty arguable but normatif for that time. Killing and oppressing ones falling into idolatry is an Abrahamic tradition, lol. That's what makes all bad in that sense.

With a 42% trade share in Canada we collect big money and I have thus been able to cut down corruption from 18 to 4, while lowering inflation from 8 to 0 (The AI raised my inflation from 3.5 to 8). With the newly acquired wealth, I could afford to colonize 4 provinces in Maine which increased my dev by 25 or so. By the end of the session I started colonizing Guyana in my goal of acquiring 4 colonies for each colonial region so that I can maximize my dev as a relatively minor nation, without Colonial Nations forming. The Carribean is unfortunately not possible for me to colonize anymore as I was not available during the first 2 hours of this session when there was still land to colonize there, but in the next session I will look into putting the flag of Mann in Lousiana, Mexico and Colombia. 

The goal of not having Colonial Nations is a big limiter for my colonization efforts, but it is the only way I see where I can get more dev. Once i run out of colonial regions, I'll have to look into other options (if there are any). 

In any case, The Duchy of Mann is recovering very well from economic troubles and we are catching up in tech (our base was really poor due to being released from England). We have been unfortunate with 2 weak rulers in a row now, but the new ruler is fertile so I hope to get a good heir next. Next session will likely be a lot more impactful for the run as I now got the resources needed to actually expand at a good pace.

yes exactly! the british public and many in the political establishment, and the military didn't care enough about ""ottoman lands"" to go to war over them. We didn't have the motivation for it. It was basically churchill and lloyd calling for war.

&gt; However, your paid Greek mercenaries failed miserably.

&gt; The reason you couldn’t do the same in Anatolia is because Turkish people had more motivation and military power to keep you out, Arabs didn’t have that.

That's a stumble ,not a long time thing. Don't red reddit fool you, everybody is  anti-Russia on reddit, and pro-Western. 

&gt;. But even if Greece was Rusophilic they are too dependent on EU to act against them. Siding with the country that suffers from EU sanctions would barely do them any favors.

They don't have to do it officially, they unofficially kept helping Serbia and Republika Srpska during NATO bombings and the wars.

&gt;I don't. However I see what he is doing and pushing through Embassies and other agencies. Albania is now preparing for 2 more military bases heavily pushed by USA alongside a political purge heavily monitored by the FBI. In Kosovo they are putting more units in Bondsteel and are one of the main supporters of the kosovo army ( obviously to sell their gear )

Didn't NATO say No to Thacis proposal of forming an army?

&gt;The internet is an alternate reality from the real world from what I have seen xpetially when it comes to Russia. Its 2018 and I've seen cavalries of Crussaders from the Middle Ages build shrines to Putin and Russia as defenders of European Values and Steven Seagal lol.

&gt;What are they doing in Serbia?

Vucic forcing the referendum rethoric, when in reality, nobody wants to even have the referendum,except maybe the LDP, who didn't pass the census for a decade almost. 


&gt;China plans to take over the Balkans same way they are taking over Africa and ME through debt and ""free"" investment where they offer to build and finance large buildings for nothing in return. 

Indeed, they are building a useless road for a shit ton of money in Montenegro, which will throw them into massive debt with 0 gain from it (we do get gain form it however). 

Im not saying *what* they're doing is right, but it *will* buy them massive amounts of influence, you can't do crap against someone who owns the majority of your debt. 

&gt;If they do take over the Balkans I hope the leader of China will be a fan of Soviet Movies lol :

If you use google, you can actully find sources for coal powerplants efficiency - for example [first result](https://www.powermag.com/who-has-the-worlds-most-efficient-coal-power-plant-fleet/). They say that the most efficient coal powerplants has 41.6 % efficiency. 

Then you consider the transmission losses which are just a little bit over [6 %](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission#Losses)

Then you consider the engine efficiency which is about [95 % - didn't bother to find a English source, you have a graph there](http://www.pohonnatechnika.cz/skola/motory/motory-s-vysokou-efektivitou)

Now you calculate all this stuff and you get 37 % efficency. Which is ""basically double"" as you said.

395,"The ""problem” is that there's an international (pretty logic) law that says “if you find someone in the sea, you have to take him/her to the closest SAFE port.”

The law itself is great and obviously makes a lot of sense, but as always there’s someone that finds a “legal” way to work against the law: if you buy a shitty boat in Africa you “just” need to place yourself in water, in one of the most boat-crowded places in the Mediterranean and wait for someone to pass by. You then need to call an sos and the “saving” boat that passes by is obliged to rescue the people on the “shitty” boat.

Due to the fact that some idiot decided to “export democracy” in Africa and Middle East, the closest SAFE port is not in Tripoli (for example) but most likely in Italy. 

So.. what’s the solution? 
- The Left says “ok let’s put a lot of boats just outside Tripoli, waiting for someone to rescue, we don’t want to have deaths in sea as a responsibility ”.. that’s a great idea, besides the fact that it’s like saying “hey come over here, it’s a free taxi to Europe “ and it will never solve the problem... and adds the problem of “what do those people do once in Italy?” .. and the good answer is “let’s give them a place to stay and some money, because this is what humans deserve!”... so you’re basically importing a lot of desperate persons and paying them to do nothing until Europe decides what to do. This gets a lot of people with minimum wage comprehensively pissed off. But you’re undeniably doing the right thing!

- the Right (Salvini &amp;co)  are more on the idea that “ the party is over and they should go wherever they want, but in Italy”... some of their supporters are more like “let’s bomb them” (we do have some little Trump over here too) , but their rational and official answer to the problem is “let’s help them at their place: instead of wasting shitlords of money in bureaucracy here, let’s invest this money in their country to help them live with dignity “.. this sounds great, but it’s a hell of a problem anyways.

Moreover, on this whole mess, Europe hasn’t a clear idea on what is right and what is wrong, because everyone says that the illegal immigrants have to go to “another country “. There are some (in my opinion) stupid deals in the union, that have never been thought to work but they were closer to a “ok we wrote something about it, good boys”. There will be negotiations and this will take time... meanwhile? The former government was more on the “let’s take everyone and then we will decide”, the actual government loves more the idea of “letting them in , only if we know what they will do and where they will go”.

It’s a very complicated picture, and it’s even more complicated if you consider the fact that a lot of nations have to work on a big common deal to fix the problem... and this takes a lot of time.

The good news is that on the last crisis (unbelievably) Albania responded that was willing to help those poor souls waiting since the beginning of time on a boat that couldn’t touch land, because no one was willing to help the people that was carrying.

397,"Not the best examples. The long work hours issue with jobs in the medical area and their negative effect are widely known - and nothing done against with measurable statistically significant morbidity rates in hospitals due to errors because of overworked staff and shortened life expectancy among the staff.

In Jobs that need creativity in general it is shown that more than 6-7h lead to drastically lowered quality and errors. Basically let on guy work till he is finished and if he arrives next day he isn't able to do anything properly and let the other guy do 2*7 hours and he is always fit. You should be able to uphold your work speed indefinitely without any harm. This is also a well researched area.

I won't say anything about working in the military, as this is not a typical job here, but I think I read a paper from DARPA stating something similar.

Basically working your 8 hours/day will lead you to the same target in the same amount of time because you are always fit and alert, because you aren't overworked at all at any point of time. And to be quite frank I know many people who tend to work too much - And many of them use things to keep them wake, and that is the ultimate form to destroy body and mind.

I nearly never saw co-workers that worked longer hours finish earlier as expected or be more productive at all, quite the opposite in fact. It just seemed that way because they where always there. But results and numbers don't lie in the end ;) They just catched a nice burnout or other psychical/physical illnesses along their way. And if someone needs to stop working with 40-45 and go to therapies and the like - not even able to enjoy the free time - then that's clearly not a win situation.

They threw Poland under the bus despite them being allies.

France and Britain were very hesitant to start the war. When Germany invaded Poland they left their western borders lightly manned. The Allied forces did not even seize the opportunity to strike, and for eight months after the declaration of war nothing happened on the western front aside from a few skirmishes and a tiny invasion of Saarland that fizzled out in merely a couple of days. Eventually the Germans turned the table on the Allies and invaded France and the Low Countries in May 1940.

&gt;Today we have a slightly different opinion on the military usefulness of wings. Two things are emphasised.

&gt;The wings (as well as other elements of Hussar equipment - leather imposed on the armour) had a certain ideological form, perhaps magical. They were to transform a warrior into an extraordinary being, supernatural, equipped with great power. The model was to be predatory birds (hence wings with eagles, vultures or falcons feathers), as well as predatory animals (leopards, tigers, wolves or bears).

&gt;(2) The wings were to have an effect primarily on the opponent's psyche (which would correlate with the content of the parable letter). While the rustling feathers were difficult to catch in the hustle and bustle of the battle, their sight could have scared the horses and made the man shiver. Anyway, not only the wings fulfilled this function. A long copy with a rotating proportion and a galloping, animal skin interacted in the same way. Especially on horses, which by nature are quite shy.

Just because the Turks are Muslims doesn’t give them the right to claim for their own the Ottoman legacy. Bosnians are also Muslims and they were Ottomans, Albanians too. The fact that Turkish leaders relate to the Ottomans and dream of revival of the Ottoman Empire by forging myths and spreading them to the people is a matter of study for phycology and not for the science of history, which relies on pure facts.

730,"We are starting to argue in circles and it is starting to become ""no you"" ""no you"" between us so I am not sure how much longer this will last. We might just disagree. I will address a few things though.

&gt;As I said earlier German women have more children (currently close to 1.60 children per woman vs 1.75 in the US). So the future isn't that grim as you tend to portray. And beside Germany, the UK with 1.85 children per woman and France with 1.90 is doing better than the US in terms of fertility rate.

Like I said earlier the fertility rate right now does not matter in making a millennial generation that can replace the boomers. Also UK and France does not equal all of Europe. It is all the rest that matter. The only one besides them that have okay demographics is Sweden.

&gt;The whole part ""they will be sequestered into ghettos"" is pure imagination again from you. And in terms of ghettos it seems Germany has no lesson to be given from the US since millions of Hispanics and Black Americans live or were in US ghettos for decades.

The reason I brought up ghettos is that when people can not participate in society because they do not speak the native language they tend to find eachother, group together, and the result of this ghettos. Black and Hispanic unemployment rate is at historic lows and most speak the English language. They are doing fine.

&gt;You tend to portray the US demographic situation as better than it is in reality, the US millenials won't be enough to take care of baby boomers once they retire. 

They will do much better than other developed nations. I will bring up the pyramid image again. They will experience crunch for a few years because Gen-X is not big enough but the millenials are right after to pick up the slack.

https://www.indexmundi.com/graphs/population-pyramids/united-states-population-pyramid-2016.gif

Here is the one for germany. For whatever reason it is a little bugged but still shows the bars which is what is important.

http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/fig24-doble.png

The problem is that much of Europe except UK, France, and Sweden look like Germany. The biggest problems are Germany and Italy. Reasons being is that Germany is the biggest economic power in the EU and Italy is a bomb waiting to happen because of their debt situation that might have a chance of taking the whole EU with them. I repeat this from previous posts because it does not seem you realize the extent of the situation.

&gt;And the lower and declining employment rate (around 75% of the active population, lower than in both Germany and the UK) isn't also helping the public budget and add further pressure to the debt.

Employment in the US at the moment is 3.9% which is very good. The Federal Bureau is worried about the economy overheating from this(for good reason) so raised the interest rates. The ECB has not raised the interests rates and interest rates for financing are still at zero. 

https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2018/html/ecb.mp180308.en.html

&gt;At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.

Also participation rates are on par with eachother but lower than Germany and Uk barely.

http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/070115barclays2.jpg

&gt;But it doesn't need to be a genius to see that current US government policies are the perfect mix to start a new world recession, and usually the countries that suffer the most are the ones that have few social protection such as the US. The previous 2008 crisis countries such as Germany and France were way less affected due to their economical model.

All economies were affected by the recession but Americans recovered well enough and at much faster rate than France. Us suffered slightly worse year during recession but recovered more than twice as fast compared to France. Clicking 10 years will show.

&gt;Greece by 2060 will certainly experience higher growth than currently thus lowering faster the debt burden. And by 2060, as you love to extrapolate, the EU could have a common fiscal authority and budget sharing. Time will tell.

They would have to keep a surplus of 2% by 2060. They also have bad demographics  and with the demographic crisis coming upon the EU I am not sure how much longer they will be recieveing EU funds.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/imf-peak-pessimism-brexit-eu-referendum-european-union-international-monetary-fund

&gt; The debt deferments are contingent on a large primary surplus (before debt repayments and interest) of 3.5 percent until 2022 and then 2.2 percent until 2060, as well as a whole program of tough economic and governance measures, which will be controlled by the creditors in the course of quarterly inspections. In other words, the country’s exit from the bailout program is far from clean.

Anyway, the situation with Greece is not that dire because it is a small player in the big scheme of things. Italy is the big problem. Europe needs to do something about them. They are a ticking time bomb.

&gt;. As for Puerto Rico, I could have said the same for Louisiana, Mississippi or Alabama. In these states the situation is far from improving and they do not have the potential advantage or attractivity Greece has.

Not sure what you mean by this especially Alabama which is receiving huge foreign investment by your biggest companies creating good job growth. None are like greece. 

&gt;Wrong. Demographics don't solve everything. If so countries like India or Nigeria would have been successful. One important factor is how the majority of the population is economically speaking. If they have no means and money for consuming you can have a one billion sized economy it won't make your economy great. And this is why I'm worrying about the US current economic state with fewer people profiting fron the US wealth, a poorer population overally speaking so less consumers, less investments.

If you look at average per-capita for US it is at 59,500$ which is very good. Headlines misrepresent the situation in US a little, the problem is America's poorest(bottom 5) are poorer and America's richest(top 1%) are richer though those are both fringe groups but America still has a big middle class. Demographics are huge for economies. IF nigeria and india had demographics of Germany in their extremely poor state they would have a very hard time finding a way out.

&gt;A ""Trump thing"".

I referred to it as a Trump thing because no one demanded he be aggressive to EU only Mexico and China. He is doing this all on his own. His constituents and the party he ran for certainly did not want this. You can rest blame on american people but I was only assuaging you of fears that Americans feel hostile toward Europeans. If anything average Europeans feel much more hostile towards average american going by polls.

&gt;And as you seem to be interested in demographics, young Britons are clearly against Brexit (close to 70% of the young voters), and each year older people are dying off and being replaced by this more Europhile generation. It becomes very difficult to predict anything for Britain and what is going to happen these next years, but I really doubt the British want to get rid of the Single Market, and a solution or a new vote will be achieved someday.

Good point. The torries might want to appeal to this group of new voters for future party relevance but they do not seem to care. They only care for their constituents and I am not sure how many will die of old age between now and 2019 but most likely not enough to sway the Torries from their path.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/9aaiw7/according_to_imf_in_2018_europeexcluding_cis/e4v4xoh/,jckeller86,1535295579

It's always convenient to subject an act of ideological and ethical criticism to a test of material benefit. 

But that's a norm *you* introduce now.

We don't need your benchmarks for ""utility"" when we, critics of Russia, make ourselves heard. We don't have to do it for measurable or quantifiable benefit: in fact, often such acts of defiance are made with considerabke risk of *detrimental* consequences.

And yet, it is the right thing to do to reintroduce Boris Nemtsov into the news cycle, get people like you upset that we're talking about Russian authoritarianism and political violence again.

That, to us, *is* not just the right thing to do, it's beneficial as well. Russia presents itself as benign, and critics expose this lie by reviving one of many recent (&lt; 15-20 years) examples of the opposite.

Please resist the urge to respond by complaining about the United States with a Whataboutism though.

&gt; Mattias Karlsson, the party’s parliamentary head and chief ideologue, says that immigrants are one of two groups his party is working hardest to attract. “Our two main target groups are immigrants and women,” he told the Observer. “We feel we still have a great potential to grow in those groups.”

&gt; The most recent opinion survey from the government agency Statistics Sweden suggests that the strategy could be paying off: astonishing for a party whose leader, Jimmie Åkesson, once described the growing number of Muslims in Sweden as “our greatest foreign threat since the second world war”.

&gt; In May 2014, in the run-up to the last general election, the Sweden Democrats had the support of 2% of foreign-born citizens. In May this year, it was 12%. “A lot of the crime is happening in the suburbs where a lot of foreign-born people live,” Karlsson said. “It’s their cars that are being burned. It’s their kids’ schools that are descending into chaos.”

Because just 'people who changed their minds' doesn't really warrant a term next to what they changed their minds to. I mean there are fascists who turned leftist too, should we call their ideology 'post-fascism' instead of what they actually believe? 

Also the people you seem to be putting in the category of post-leftism weren't exactly the people who were communists before the fall of the USSR. But you're talking about -oh no- people *who are Jews* now. The horror. Being Jewish. Wow. As if Jews would all have the same views and none of them would align with people who aren't Jewish.

&gt; jew loving, jewish influence denying

I guess you don't want to hide your antisemitism at all. Most people on the left, (you know, people I know a little bit better than you) don't like or dislike people because of their ethnicity or religion. Seems like you're interpreting 'not hating them all' as loving them all. How do you explain how leftists are often anti-zionists and criticize the state of Israel for their settler-colonial tactics and treating Palestinians as second class citizens? Surely, that wouldn't be possible if your backwards generalizing view of the world would be true. Hey here's some nuance; lots of Jews disagree with each other on a lot of things. There's anti-zionist Jews for example, even a significant amount of rabbis, and obviously there's zionist Jews. 

Sorry for not having outright hate for any ethnicity for just existing. Must be scary, living in this fantasy where you think everyone hates you just for being white. Or maybe it just calms you if you can pretend to be oppressed. 

The neoliberal establishment has never been leftist. I mean Hillary Clinton, who I assume you put in there, campaigned for Goldwater in her youth for example. These people were only okay with things like gay marriage once it was clear the majority consensus was going to stick. Their opinions change with what the majority believes at the time in order to win their elections. You're really living in a fantasy if you think they're leftists.

At that point decision are made by how much they are in tune with Xi's preferences and wishes. With a country as rich and powerful as china this can go on for a while since problems can be hidden with public debt, media control and intimidation. But at some point reality can't be ignored and the crisis comes. Then we will see how strong the communist party and what kind of person Xi is. If he is a good leader he steps back and his supporters get replaced with talented people from the second and third row. They then introduce reforms and clean up the mess. But the longer the crisis takes the longer Xi has time to place his men in leading positions and get suppress rivalling factions that can replace him. And that means when the crisis comes it takes longer to pop the bubble, or in the worst case he can stay in power. 

I don't say that Xi is a bad leader. But it is just normal human behaviour to surround yourself with people that share your opinions and agree with you. You see that all the time in western political parties and companies. Working democracies and well regulated markets just have ""cleaning"" procedures to get rid of leaders that screw up.

Jewish members of Britain's Labour Party who have suffered abuse from party leader Jeremy Corbyn's ""hardline supporters"" will be offered bodyguards at an upcoming party conference,  Daily Mail reported Sunday.

According to the report, the Jewish Labour Movement discussed providing security for Jewish MPs Dame Margaret Houdge, Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth, all three of whom have been the target of anti-Semitic abuse.

Berger made headlines recently for criticizing Corbyn after video footage emerged of him saying that British ""Zionists"" are unable to understand British culture despite living in the U.K. all of their lives.

Berger said that she feels ""unwelcome"" in her own party after Corbyn's ""unexcusable comments."" The video was recorded in 2013 and was featured on Hamas' English language website.

The conference will take place from in Liverpool from September 23 until 26. ""The CST are reporting back with a full assessment of the security requirements. There is a real concern about safety,"" the report quoted a source as saying.

#### ""This conference will be particularly tense as much of the worst anti-Semitic trolling on the internet has been traced back to hotspots in Merseyside [near Liverpool],"" the source added.

The footage that emerged of Corbyn was the latest incident of a string of revelations detailing the Labour leader's antipathy for the Jewish state and highlights the widening gap between the British left and the country’s Jewish community.

Earlier this week it emerged that Corbyn’s longtime secretary had urged Labor supporters to oppose candidates who appeared in the Jewish media. In a pamphlet published by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign in 2010, Nicolette Petersen recommended that Labour supporters “read the Jewish Chronicle online and look at websites that will show you who not to vote for,” asserting that it was better to divert support from Labour than to support anyone considering himself a “friend of Israel,” according to The Sun on Monday.

Last month, Britain’s three jewish newspapers, including the Chronicle, united in publishing a front-page editorial warning of the existentional threat to British Jewry that a government led by Jeremy Corbyn would pose.

“We do so because the party that was, until recently, the natural home for our community has seen its values and integrity eroded by Corbynite contempt for Jews and Israel,” the editorials said, referring to the Labour Party. “The stain and shame of anti-Semitism has coursed through Her Majesty’s Opposition since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015.”",,/r/europe/comments/9aepgt/jewish_labour_mps_to_get_bodyguards_at_party/e4uv0si/,blackstonebite,1535280783

907,"&gt; It just believes the wrong people are running the right system. 

I think this sums it up pretty well. 

The social democrats of the early 2000's focused so much on cleaning up the economy - which they succeeded in doing - but stopped listening to the people. Biggest example is the referendum about joining the EMU. Every political party wanted to join, but not the people. 

And when Swedes want change, we don't vote for something, we vote against something. So at first we tried the conservatives. And change came, but not the change people wanted (instead they crushed the unions in a way that would've made Thatcher proud). So we tried the social democrats again. And even though change came, it was too little, too slow and not in all the right areas. The Green party is a lot to be blamed here, as they've been an utter disaster, barely doing anything ""green"" at all. 

Those in power have dodged the issue of integration. I highly doubt even the vast majority of Sweden Democrat voters want to close the borders, that's usually the old core, racist voters. A minority. Because it's not about immigration, it's about integration. And it isn't functioning. It takes years to help people gain a foothold on their own, language classes are sometimes offered an hour every two weeks for example. How is that going to help? And when people can't support themselves, we see the birth of rumours of immigrants coming here being satisfied with getting grants, getting big houses etc.  

So people vote against those running the system. Until those in power starts reworking the integration process (and very soon it will turn to a bigger environmental focus) the Sweden Democrats will grow. And the danger here is that they have absolutely no plan whatsoever how to run this country. They're greatly unfunded, and they express views that barely no Swedes agree with like anti abortion, openly homophobic and climate denial to a great extent. But this isn't spoken about, they don't need to, as they gain enough support from their one question. It's clear they can't run this country, but when people feel other parties can't either, what's there to lose? 

Still, the Sweden Democrats don't want to be in power now. It's good for them to be in opposition. The longer they can't be held accountable, they will grow bigger. Their wet dream would be if the Social Democrats team up with the conservatives, that would really mean it's ""us against them"".

999,"The 2nd Armoured landed in France on the 1st of August and played a critical role in the Battle of the Falaise Pocket. So the 2nd Armoured had partaken in one of the most decisive battles of the Normandy Campaign, and it was also the 2nd Armoured which had to fight the Germans in and around Paris. They didn't just 'wander' into Paris and liberate the city, there was actually a lot of fierce combat between the French and the Germans prior to Gen. von Choltitz's surrender on the 25th. It was - by all accounts - Leclerc and the French themselves that liberated Paris. You keep talking about how the British and Americans did all the fighting, and sure; Paris couldn't have been liberated and France freed from German occupation, without France's British and American allies, but it was the French themselves that freed Paris. It was Leclerc and his armour that fought the battles in and around Paris, it was Leclerc and his armour whom the Germans in Paris surrendered to, and it was Leclerc and his armour which liberated Paris. It was evidently not the British and the Americans alone who were 'doing the fighting'. The French themselves were very active, and u/Etibamriovxuevut is absolutely right in his comparison to Russia. The Liberation of France may not have been possible without the Americans and the British, but it wouldn't have been possible without the Russians tying up 80+% of German forces. No one would claim that Russia liberated Paris simply because they were, all in all, the largest contributor in the fight against Germany, so why should the British and Americans get the credit for liberating Paris simply because they had more units and men than the French at the time?

1024,"&gt; Compare these then see Germany. Italy is like Germany

Germany has indeed a demographic problem, but Italy is worse off currently. 

Germany welcomed migrants en masse for some reasons, as did the US decades ago: To grow their working population. Was it a good choice or not to allow over 1 million people to come in? That's another debate. For now Germany hasn't experienced any dramatical population decrease. Also Germany and Italy are quite crowded places like England. Frankly as an European I wouldn't mind a population decrease if we can also increase our economic standards at the same time. The single market has almost 200million more people than the US despite having a smaller territory and the whole of Europe has the double of US population. So a demographic change is nothing to worry about. And as for ""budget hell"" IMF projections for the next 5 years indicates that the EU overally speaking will have saner budgets even with an increasing retiring population. You seem to believe the US is better off whereas it's wrong, the US will also experience problems with its boomers retiring, as every developed nations do.

&gt;Even now, Greece crisis still has not been solved just shifted the books a little. Greece still owes more on its receivership loans than its GDP.

Greece experiences currently a budget surplus. And its situation is not worse than Puerto Rico. 

&gt;Then you have US military leaving with Russia on front door so you will have to start paying for military 

Oh yes. The good old ""you'll have to start paying for military"" and the ""Russian threat"", good Trump bot. Let me tell you something: Russian budget for the military is dwarfed by France+UK+Germany alone. 

&gt; . All of this is going to cause capital flight towards the US which will help US but hurt Europe even further.

Both Russia and the EU have their own interests, but both economies are closely intertwined. There is no reason they would try to destroy each other. The capital isn't going to get out of Europe, considering the shift in the geopolitical stage, and the Eurasian region being the most dynamic and economically powerful region in the whole world. The one belt one road project shows that America is getting closer to be a peripherical zone as it was before the 20th century.

&gt; US is not going through budget hell as they are still spending and not cutting and receiving economic harm from it

Oh, didn't know that European states stopped spending. There is a difference between spending reasonably and OVERspending like the Trump administration is currently doing. 

The 2008 crisis started in the US for a reason: Lower regulation and dangerous budget mismanagement at least since the Reagan area with a notably improvement under Clinton but cancelled with Bush junior's poor policies.

&gt;With a global currency US in a way can offload it's debt and inflation to the world that other countries do and can not as well.

The Euro is also a global currency, you seem to omit that quite easily. 20-30% of global trade made in Euros isn't insignificant at all.

The Dollar offers the possibility for the US to overspend and have higher deficit, but that's not forever. Debt interests already double those of Germany, France and the UK. And I wouldn't trust a random redditor such as you to foretell what's going to happen to the US in the upcoming years with Trump's catatrophic mismanagement. 

In a perfect world I wish the US would not have an insane government to jeopardize the whole world with their petty gambles in trade wars. 

I don't want the worst for the US, I'm actuallu really worried about how things are turning, and it's very sad to see Europe biggest ally to reject us and treat us as ennemies such as Russia or China and at the meantime weakening themselves and be seen as fools in the world stage. Trump is a F idiot to attack everyone in trade whereas an alliance between Europe and the US against China would have been successful. A waste of opportunity.

&gt;Oh and I forgot to mention that UK is leaving EU on top of it.

 I honestly don't believe the British will choose to get out from the single market and stop doing business with their main trade partners. 

I noticed you quite like to imagine the future but I would me more cautious if I were you for the predictions you made about the US supposed fortune in the coming years and the UK totally leaving the single market.",Romanian living in Cornwall,/r/europe/comments/9aaiw7/according_to_imf_in_2018_europeexcluding_cis/e4us4w8/,Qytubreborn2,1535273900

*What do the rest of the people feel that are affected by this problem?* Resentment towards anything connected to this elite, in most cases towards the political party in power because they see it as the enabler of this problem, for understandable reasons.

*How can these people solve this problem?* By voting for the party or parties that prioritize this problem which happens to be the right, including far-right but in this case SD is relatively centrist compared to Europe.

It's pretty standard in this case - if the elite do not act (which they have started to do as a response to this by changing the rhetoric significantly - however it's much too late and can be seen as opportunistic), expect backlash from the *antithesis*.

*Alp Arslan: ""My punishment is far heavier. I forgive you, and set you free.""*

&gt;Romanos was cruelly blinded on 29 June 1072 in Constantinople. According to Attaleiates, the emperor was lead away, pleading for mercy, to be blinded by an ""inexperienced Jew"" who required three attempts to blind the emperor while he ""bellowed like a bull"". Per Attaleiates, ""when he arose, his eyes were drenched with blood, a pathetic and pitiable sight that made everyone who saw it cry uncontrollably."" He was then sent into exile to Prote in the Sea of Marmara. Without medical assistance, his wound became infected, and he soon endured a painfully lingering death. The final insult was given a few days before his death, when Romanos received a letter from Michael Psellos, congratulating him on the loss of his eyes.

1120,"It's not only about religion and colonization with Turks, there's stuff like, I don't know, constant conflict with the occupied losing thousands of people because they are a ragtag group of poorly equipped peasants and not a modern, rich, empire, subjugation of the economy and trade, heavy tribute, sometimes obligation to take part in Turkey's wars(at Vienna there was a Moldovan army and a Wallachian one, although they didn't engage), but I'll bite. 

&gt;Romania 

If we're talking Dobrogea, more than half the population was muslim in 1878. If we're talking about Moldova and Wallachia, they were autonomous regions (it was better to leave them as buffer states and focus on Hungary and Austria, which was the real aim), not actually part of the empire, so although they didn't enjoy the colonization, they had to enjoy only the constant conflict, subjugation of the economy and trade, and heavy tribute. Here's a little quote from Barbara Jelavich's History of the Balkans: 

&gt;In 1709, the total tax receipts o f the Wallachian government were
649.000 thalers, and of these, 514,000 were sent in one way or another to the Turks. In 1710, of the total receipts of 547,000 thalers,
430.000 went to the Turks. In terms of gold, this amounted to between
180,000 and 220,000 gold ducats a year for tribute. This was
twice as much as the official tribute, and one-third to one-half again
as much as the tribute paid in the 1590s.

&gt;The Porte also saw the Principalities as a major source of supplies for the
military and, in particular, for the city of Constantinople. It thus maintained
the right of preemption on agricultural products. Imperial agents, who were
chiefly interested in buying sheep, cattle, and grain, could make the first purchases,
and they also determined the prices to be paid. The power entrusted
to these agents gave them in many cases what amounted to a right of confiscation.
Since price and trading conditions were thus severely circumscribed,
the agricultural development of the provinces was hampered. In the eighteenth
century the chief activity was animal husbandry; grain production was
to predominate only in the second half of the next century.
In addition to the tribute and the delivery of food supplies, the Principalities
were liable for a long list of other payments, including gifts due at the
accession of each new sultan and bribes to maintain the favor of influential
officials. The native princes had to make payments, both at their appointment
and at periodic intervals during their reigns.

And this was before the Phanariot rules, which are like a black hole in Romanian history (at least its economy).  

&gt;Bulgaria 

In the 1880 census, 26.3% of the population had Turkish as their mother tongue; in 2011 8% were Turks, and 7.8% of the population was Muslim

&gt;Serbia 

I'm gonna lump the rest of (former) Yugoslavia and ask you to take a look at what happened last century. Bonus: Montenegro's population is still 20% muslim.

The rest is some strange kind of conspiracy theory of somehow the left being in power somewhere? What's that about '-isms' that you just made up? How does it follow from 'no those words are contradictions' that you can use no words that end in -ism to describe some things? And idk who you think my 'friends' are? Post-leftism has criticisms of power and establishment as central to the ideology, and is almost opposite of neoliberalism in terms of how they want society to be. Neoliberalism is free market politics to the maximum possible extent without creating *total* chaos. Apparently you think this ideology just exists with everyone adhering to it thinking it'd just magically disappear on its own? Even though on the left everyone recognizes that the last defense mechanism of capitalism in crisis is fascism, something nobody on the left wants? 

&gt; and they all bend the knee to the jewish intelligentsia that birthed them

Yes of course you had to bring in the Jews. They're the cause of everything you don't like, aren't they? Do you plan to do something specific about that? I mean, you seem very upset by someone wanting fascism not to spread, there's not much else to conclude here. 

&gt; Do you have a better nomenclature for these people? 

You mean the power hungry capitalists at the top? Well, for one, you could stop conflating it with leftists just because you are further to the right than those right-wingers. They'd lose their power under any kind of leftist rule, they obviously want to keep oppressing the working class and keep their private companies and massive wealth. They influence politics to have tax cuts for the rich and putting the burden on the poor. When their corporations are profitable, they keep the wealth, but when they aren't the people pay for it through the state. Both the state and that upper class wouldn't exist anymore. Seems like you have disdain exactly for the things communists want to abolish but they also criticize racism, white supremacy and ethnonationalism so you turn to the exact opposite for some reason? Btw, the name for the people you seem to want to describe, that aren't leftists, is the bourgeoisie. 

&gt; Nah. According to modern U.S. liberals, they'd be 'classical liberals' and shouldn't be talked about.

A lot of neoliberals call themselves classical liberals too, as if their ideology didn't arise in the 70's and 80's. When someone says classical liberal, 95% of the time they mean neoliberal. Idk who thinks they shouldn't be talked about, I for one never had that experience, but I don't care if liberals say that. I'm no liberal after all. Unless your definition of liberalism is 'everyone who isn't far-right and doesn't blame the Jews for everything'. That's what people on the right and a lot of centrists in the US think liberals are, because their overton window has shifted so far to the right centrism seems like it's left-wing. That's also how you get these confused people who think the fucking bourgeoisie is Marxist or something. Where here in r/europe, and here I thought people still knew that liberals are centrists, more often right-leaning than not? The main right-wing party in my country calls themselves liberal, classical liberal and neoliberal and actively wants to emulate the policies of the 80's neoliberals with rebranded trickle-down policy (""oh noes if corporations and rich people have to pay tax all the money will leave!""). You really need to start learning what these words actually mean instead of just using them as boogeymen for things you don't like, and stop blaming Jews for them.

1469,"&gt; Lol. Based on what?

Conservatism and how much the religion or backwardness of that religion effects of course.

&gt; Also make up your damn mind regarding restrictions. You keep switching from geography defined restrictions to root of the holly books.

Nope. I'm saying in the terms of the source, Christianity is worse. You came up with the but reforms, and I've pointed out that that varies. You came up with but you're selecting things, and I came up with the chunk that is relevant to the region.

&gt; Uhm. No. you took some subdivisions from one abrahamic religion and compared to some subdivisions from another. Worst from one, best from the other and then jumped to conclusions.

No, I'm basically compared to religions. Plain and simple.

&gt; Like how much? 1%?
Christianity has most of its bad stuff in Old Testament. New Testament, while not perfect, is way better.

Like, enough to include literal total annihilations and genocidal acts.

&gt; Wahhabism exists today. Reformation, remember? We talked about it. You take something bad that existed in Christianity and based on that claim that Christianity is worse then Islam. Maybe it was at some point. Definitely not today.

Wahhabism is a new trend mate, it's not something existed way before. If you're for that there are crazy versions of Christianity around as well, while we are talking about religions, remember?

&gt; Right. Muslims magically appeared in Balkans. And Christians werent pushed to conversion at all. They weren't even 2nd class citizens right?

And this has nothing to do with if forced conversions existed. Saying Christians haven't pushed conversions in Europe is also rich, and rather ignorance or lying.

&gt; Totally convinced bro. What exactly is worse in Christian World than ISIS?

Most of the Christian history? For the contemporary ones, you can start with the Lord's Resistance Army or ones in Central Africa who do go with cannibalism though, aside from other terror organisations, or the good old first half of the 20th century.

&gt; We agree here. What I'm saying is that Christianity changed a lot since then. Islam a lot less. Even though Islam is younger, is more backward because of this resistence to change.

That depends. What you call change is, mostly the religion becoming weak or other forms being more dominant, which you can see for Islam as well, or you can see opposite for Christianity too.

&gt; Yeah. again NO. Sure Christianity has its bad parts in History. Inquisition for example. But compared to a religion started a warlord, a world that expanded by destroying almost anything in its path. People give crap to Christianity for a few Crusades but they forget to take a look at battles waged by muslims attacking Christianity which are at least 2 orders of magnitude more.

I'd rather give crap to Christianity for justifying genocides in Americas or the clerical fascists, if not for the crusades that targeted north, destruction of the old religions, or many other stuff than stupid crusades into the Levant.

&gt; Exactly. People that are hard to find in muslim world because the way religion is ingrained into society.

Lol, take a look at European Muslims and say that again.

&gt; Christianity allows these people to exist and do their thing.

It does not. It's now weak and kicked out of the state affairs at least to a limit so that now it can't do any real harm anymore, except when it does harm still, or where it's still strong enough.

&gt; In Islam you might not have the required education available (especially if you're a women) or you might even lose your head (literally) at worst. Yet you claim that Islam is better.  
It used to be bad in Christianity also. For example medicine, body being sacred and all that. But things changed. Reformation, remember? Thats why I'm saying that Christianity is better and Islam needs reform.

You're referring to some theocracies, and some contemporary situation of religion being weak in some *Christian* societies. Sure, that makes an Abrahamic religion better than the other, lol. If you're saying, religion being diluted and irreligion is better, sure, can't agree more. Again, let's hope this for Christians who are voting for Christian parties still, or conservatives and Africa etc. while also for Muslims in Africa or Mid East, and Indian subcontinent.

I understand that. But environmentally it makes sense to shut down the coal plants now at pretty much any cost, even if that means developing nuclear power. I agree that gas is not a huge priority at the moment. But coal is pretty much priority 1 around the world. And even if Germany had a decent plan to transition to renewables, there are plenty of other countries around Europe that do not, so any clean energy you can produce is helpful, including nuclear.

Because he and anyone even remotely paying attention has realised that redistribution will never happen, at least not in any significant way.

Or maybe how Italy is racist. I don't think either are because that is a ridiculous standard for a racist or Apartheid society. The reason they have open borders towards Jews is because the state of Israel was created as a safe haven for Jews after it became clear they couldn't be guaranteed safety in Europe. And that policy has existed because other countries have proven the same, from the Soviet Union to places like Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Algeria. Iraq at one point was estimated to 130,000 Jews and their most recent estimate was 5 in 2013. Egypt used to be 75,000 Jews and in 2016 was down to 6. Syria from 10s of thousands down to 18. Algeria from 150,000 to now where it is below fifty. Israel's open door policy to Jews exists for a reason and has more of a reason to exist than the one in Ireland , Poland or Italy. Govts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa  have persecuted their Jewish population and Israel was a safe haven. The priority on Jewish migration is not racism but full filling it's goal as a state.

1650,"&gt; Is is not obvious that Germany's energy need is very different from Sweden's just based on the sheer size of our population?

No? Combined with the size of the country and the available natural resources, yes. But just population numbers are irrelevant. 

&gt;A huge part of Swedish houses are heated with district heating.

I said that didn't I? Anyway, it's still not gas, it's mostly waste heat from industries. My hometown was mostly heated by the nearby paper plant for example. And I don't think Sweden has that many more industries per capita than Germany does. 

&gt;Germany simply does not have hydroelectric potential like Sweden.

Which is why it's even more important to not be shutting down nuclear. 

Sweden is also dismantling our nuclear power btw, but only as we can cover the energy use with renewable energy. Mostly wind in our case. But I think even that is a bad idea, we should continue using nuclear power and export the excess energy to countries like Germany instead, who can't provide for their own energy needs.

I know the UK pays billions to the EU and gets back some of it.  The link you pasted in your post confirms that.  

I know that the UK used to subsidise farming etc before we joined the EU, so I'm unsure why we can't again.

So you are talking about conferences and student grants for EU/UK students.  But you aren't talking about my question.  Why can't the UK fund UK research and bypass the EU.  It's a simple as that.

Now, if the argument is well the UK could be poorer and therefore won't be able to do this.  Well I can understand that and then it comes down to how you think the UK will be affected after Brexit actually happens.  

The end statement is the bit I'm interested in.  So we don't fund our own research at the moment therefore why should we fund research in the future.  That does not make sense.

Here are the points:

- The UK has promised a lot. They haven't taken any steps to fulfill those promises so far. The money sent to the EU is  £8.6 billion or a £769 billion revenue. That money isn't such a massive amount that they can't already change their budget. They've had two years to do this. What's stopping them from doing it now? The UK has more than enough money. They just aren't taking the required action. 

- Grants take time. People can't suspend their plans for years, or the time it takes the UK to do what the EU is doing now.

- Leaving the EU will have negative effects unrelated to money, including travel.

The end statement means that your Gov is not doing much to prepare for exiting the EU, which includes helping those who rely on it's programs. Efforts like these take time, and livelihoods are in peril in those cracks of time.

Which is why at this point I accuse you of having a cavalier attitude of those who are involved. 

&gt;Why can't the UK fund UK research and bypass the EU. It's a simple as that.

**It's a false question. The UK can fund it's own research and bypass the EU. It just isn't doing that. Simple as that.**

Or in other words ""blame your own government"".

EDIT: Or even better, I can hypothesize that your government doesn't give a damn about the NHS or research. All of this is an excuse, and as soon as the UK leaves the EU, it won't do anything to compensate.

In regards to Leclerc, that's not really correct. It's true that the Americans didn't initially want to prioritize Paris, but De Gaulle forced the issue by threatening to split off from the Allied forces and attack Paris on his own. Leclerc was only in the position to move his men into the city because the Allied forces were already converging on the location due to De Gaulle's threat.

&gt; Thats what I meant by being reliant on its overseas territories. When a French ship needs supplies it can simply put into the nearest French territory which will have a naval base capable of supporting them. In the rare cases where a French base isn't close enough to be used they can resupply from one of their own auxiliary vessels if one is available or use one of their allies (a perfectly standard practice within NATO and also done by the UK).

&gt; The UK instead sends an RFA out with any ship it deploys far from its less widespread naval bases so it can resupply when needed. They are 2 ways of solving the same problem, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Just look at last years Hurricane season in the Caribbean to see the different doctrines in action. The UK stationed RFA Mounts Bay in the region loaded with disaster relief supplies which was able to respond in the immediate wake of the disaster to provide aid where necessary.

&gt; Unlike the UK France has a base in the region with a Marine detachment who were also able to offer immediate disaster relief to the civilian populace.

2151,"It comes down to lack of critical thinking.

The operative and incorrect assumption is that victimhood is a mark of morality. It has deeper sociocultural roots in the way in which Christianity evolved and the way in which human suffering, writ large, and the Passions, in particular, were interpreted.

At the risk of simplifying a very complex theological debate, relentless or tremendous suffering cleanses the subject morally. Incidentally, vestiges of this argumentative pattern can be found in left-wing ideologies that assume the weaker party has the higher moral ground and, conversely, the stronger party is at least suspicious on a moral level. Rich people must have done something immoral to accrue their fortune or at least show some negative personal traits that make them successful in business. Nietzsche calls this reversal of values slave morality and psychoanalysis has had a field day with the notion.

In this reading, the undeniable suffering the Polish people have experienced is hard to reconcile with the cruelty they've shown to Jews.

The cognitive dissonance is usually solved by imputing some deeper flaw to the Jews that were killed. They had it coming, in other words.

Of course, the assumption is wrong. 
Victims can also victimize. Poles were victimized by Germans, and they, in turn, victimized Jews.

Conversely, human psychology and statistics tell us it's very likely some Jews killed in the Holocaust must have been immoral. That doesn't justify what happened to them and, similarly, it doesn't take away from the fact that they were victimized.",,/r/europe/comments/99ypux/jewish_cemetery_in_poland_vandalized_for_second/e4synod/,el_el,1535194985

2165,"I think it's important to see those developments in correlation to the situation in the baltics. The warsaw pact is gone and there isn't really a reason for germany to have those large amounts of fastcrafts anymore, since we certainly won't use ""hit and run"" tactics to surprise a russian invasion fleet, as we'd have done it in the pre 1990s era.
So those K-130 are meant to be are an replacement for those fastcrafts with better endurance/survivability and therefore less speed. They can lay mines and still have some space for additional equipment like 4 additional RBS-15 as far as I'm aware there's space (though nothing else in preparation) for a compact towed array sonar as well in case they'd want that and given that fact I'm actually sure they'd find space for a couple of MU-90 as well. I'm actually sure they'll have thought about that. Though it's worth mentioning that there's certainly no talk about any of those measures now.

Else it's further important to remember that fastcrafts needed a tender and those corevettes are indeed meant to be used in numbers with a tender, which increases their endurance to at least 3 weeks and more, if needed. Last but not least they can of course [handle helicopters](http://www.freundeskreis-schnellboote-korvetten.de/images/boote/1kg/kg_14.jpg) and given that the are supposed to be used very close to home it does make sense that they didn't include any additional facilities. If you need a helicopter this close to home you may - likely - just fly it over when you think you need it. 

When it comes to operating them, the K-130s need less than 50 to 60 sailors while for the older Meko 200 the article mentions as an alternative that number is about 200. Given that the german navy struggles as much as most other european navies to find sailors one should keep those numbers in mind. You'll need 1200 sailors to crew those 10 K-130 with 2 crews each.

When it comes to cost it's down to small economies of scale - if you plan a class of 15 vessels and buy 5 and include some design flaws which have to be ironed out, cost goes up. The new ones will cost 350 to 400m per vessel all inclusive which seems fine, given that a real modern, german built frigate will set you back 1 billion and more right now.

In the end it's of course a compromise. They are a less suited and more expensive to operate in the baltics than fastcrafts, but they are certainly way cheaper than real frigates. Given that there seems to be some potential to uparm them in case it's needed and in case you want to pay for it, invest the time for it and take the drawbacks, I'm not that unhappy that they decided to buy 5 more of them. Especially the economies of scale should equal in better readiness and cheaper operations. ",,/r/europe/comments/99vruz/germanys_navy_is_a_total_embarrassment/e4sypxa/,J4yJ4m,1535195119

2204,"&gt; The Spanish were whipped up to a frenzy by the priests who painted Napoleon as the antichrist and fighting the French as a Crusade. 

That’s rather simplistic. The anti-Napoleonic *juntas* brought together liberals and conservatives, and the 1812 constitution, proclaimed by their parliament in Cadix under siege by Napoleon, was quite progressive (which is why Ferdinand VII lost no time in abolishing it when he came back from his comfortable exile in Talleyrand’s Valençay château). Quite a few guerrilla leaders found themselves persecuted under the subsequent absolutist regime.

Basically, what triggered the war was Napoleon’s unnecessary meddling into the telenovela-worthy family feud of the Spanish Bourbons, plus Murat’s inept and bloody handling of a relatively minor riot in Madrid on May 2nd 1808. Using Mamelukes as riot police: never a good idea. Murat was Napoleon’s bravest and most dashing maréchal, but definitely not the most intelligent. Murat’s fuck-up basically cost him the Spanish throne, with Napoleon handing it over to his brother Joseph instead, in exchange of Joseph giving up the much more comfortable throne of Naples to the hotheaded Murat: neither Murat nor Joseph were happy with this exchange...

&gt; As a bonus Napoleon was married to the creole Josephine, showing much more tolerance than the others.

Ahem...are you speaking of the same Joséphine who essentially grabbed him by the balls to re-establish slavery in the French Caribbean? I recommend you look up the subsequent Haiti campaign: its cruelty (complete with French generals feeding random black prisoners to dogs in public shows) made the Spanish campaign look like a walk in the park.

&gt; I think his biggest mistake (falling for Flavian tactics during the Russian campaign aside) was the 100 days. 

Well, Enghien’s murder was also a pretty bad decision. You know you’ve fucked up pretty thoroughly when even Fouché thinks you’ve gone too far. And the 18 Brumaire was simply stupid: what’s the point of a coup d’état when your power is already pretty much unchallenged?

&gt; Yet, the murder of 42 Jews in Kielce, as monstrous and harrowing a crime as it was, was not the only story of murder in the post-war period in Poland. As many as one to two thousand Jews may have been murdered after the war by Poles.[2] On September 1, 1944, the head of the newly-created Bureau for Matters Concerning Aid to the Jewish Population of Poland noted that ""instances in which Jews have been murdered following the departure of the Germans, which even now are recurring sporadically, are driving the remaining Jews to desperation, and a relatively large number of Jews is still afraid to come out of hiding.""[5] On October 27, 1944, a grenade was thrown into the building that had been occupied by the handful of Jews who had returned to the village of Losice.[6] A report filed in January, 1945 emphasized that ""not a week goes by in which [the body of] a Jewish murder victim is not found, shot or stabbed by an unknown assailant.""[7] Foreign news services were reporting at that time about the uncontrollable ""pogrom atmosphere"" that hung over Poland, and Poland's representatives in the Foreign Ministry acknowledged the accuracy of this description in private conversations.[8]

&gt; With women, discrimination came more often from transport firms, butchers, builders and taxi businesses.

Interesting observation and probably true.

People in general want to hire something that meets ""the stereotype"" and this isn't just in relation to sex. I'm also pretty sure that if you want to become a bouncer being black is probably an asset because that's the stereotype but if you want to become a lawyer not so much.

2407,"&gt;How exactly is 488 rapes (58% of the reported 843 convictions) in a 5-year span (less than 100 per year) evidence that rape rates are ""skyrocketing""?

If a group as small as this one (5-10%), commits 58% of rapes, how is rape *not* skyrocketing as a result of careless immigration policy? These are some *advanced mental gymnastics*.

&gt;The rate increased by 10%, but do you guys even know how to read statistics? The actual numbers are still low. 10% of 142 is still just 14! How does warrant the use of the word ""skyrocketing""?


It's quite unbelievable you can reason like this. ""Only 10%"", ""only 14 rapes"", really? Where do you draw the line? How many rapes per 100k migrants are you willing to settle for?

Would it be ""only"" 14 rapes if it were your mother, sister, aunt?

As for the word ""skyrocketing"", you're not taking into account that the increase in rape is correlated with immigration. Rape committed by ethnic Swedes, the vast majority of the population, is *decreasing* as rape by immigrants is *increasing*. These people are already 58% of convicted rapists in a country where they constitute a *small* minority of the population, being *extremely* over-represented, *and this doesn't even include the children of these people*.

Sweden's immigrant population has increased considerably, while rapes, in relation to the immigration, has skyrocketed. It's that simple.

2434,"&gt; What does this initiative is planing to achieve ?

That once someone becomes an EU citizen, they retain that as an individual, no matter how stupidly their country subsequently behaves. 

This is of particular importance eg. to people who are born in one country, but live in other countries around the EU, especially where they don't reside long enough to acquire a second citizenship. That is my own situation, incidentally. But there are many other situations. 

&gt;  Do you want to stay EU citizens after your country leaves the EU ? 

Many of us do! In Scotland, most of us do. 62% voted to stay in Europe. Every region in Scotland voted to stay in Europe. We have a neighbour country though that is trying to drag us out. 

However, the issue is not just about Scotland or about Britain. It is about what it means to be an EU citizen, and when EU citizenship can be stripped away from a citizen, under what circumstances. 

This is a topic that was never planned for earlier, and so there is an opportunity to put forward arguments about whether EU citizenship should be an individual concept.

&gt; Isn’t it basically the EU itself which is stripping you of your EU citizenship after your country leaves the EU ?

Yes, though it's hard to say because there has never been a formal process for *losing* EU citizenship, only gaining it. 

The argument being made here is that future British citizens should not automatically have any right to EU citizenship, but that existing UK-based EU citizens should have some capability to choose to keep their citizenship.

For example, if the EU were to propose a tax on any EU citizens who do not contribute automatically through the contributions of their state. That would give people a chance to contribute to the EU in exchange for ongoing EU citizenship.

A similar situation is Americans who leave the United States. They continue to be taxed as Americans, and must send money home, or they can choose to give up their citizenship as Americans. But they aren't required to live in the US all the time or move there in order to retain their citizenship. 

Right now, there is no clear model for what will happen to UK citizens, because it has never happened before and was not established in law. No one expected this; Article 50 is tiny, and does not begin to cover the problems of a country leaving Europe, never mind the situation for individual citizens. 

This petition proposes a permanent solution: EU citizens should not be stripped of individual rights of citizenship without individual cause to do so (such as personally acting against the interests of the EU). And a collective vote by a minority of a population does not represent an individual cause of each and every person.

I would also propose a permanent obligation to be attached to EU citizenship for anyone whose citizenship is not acquired through a country - standards of legal and ethical behaviour (to uphold EU norms and values), expectations to participate in EU political processes, and expectations to pay EU taxes to support the costs of running EU programs. 

I also argue that the UK must uphold equivalent standards of behaviour towards EU citizens who came to the UK under EU laws. But, that is not an issue for this petition. This petition is about whether it is fair and reasonable to strip individuals of their citizenship, when they have personally not done anything to merit that.",,/r/europe/comments/9a40e3/eu_citizens_initiative_for_permanent_eu/e4sp3qy/,slokepow,1535174838

2444,"My point is that if something happens then automatic assumption is that this is due to ""climate change"". There is nothing more unscientific than such statements. For example we heard this year that temperature was uber high in some places and this is due to ""climate change"". Fact: average temperature on the globe didn't rise in last 15 years (which is huge monkey wrench in scientists predictions). Other fact planet has its own thing and it could change average temperature by 20-30c in just 2-3 years (like when we were going out of ice age time) at any time and point. Current state of knowledge about climate is simply not sufficient to pin point anything. We can only talk about broad strokes like supposed rise of average temperature over xx or xxx years and even those predictions are most of the time invalid. For example all 80 predictions for 2020 put us in basically hell zone for 2020 and yet nothing like this happen. Because of those invalid predictions they even had to change name from ""global warming"" to nebulous ""climate change"" because it is far easier to answer question about funding where main theory of your research and predictions  doesn't seem to work. 

And let us not forget other fun stuff like that earth can just reverse its poles one day which will happen in basically single day (multiple account of that through history) if this would happen today there would be shitload of people saying this is due to ""climate change"" and we are responsible for it.

Exactly what it implies. Take the Roma population and all the issues they present. Times that by 1000. See what you come up with. 

&gt;They are virtually indistinguishable from the rest of the population.

Based upon what? America does not even classify Romani as a unique group. Hence it would be nearly impossible to judge their rates of crime/welfare usage, etc. You're just throwing wet noodles at the wall. 

&gt;If they are not integrating in other countries, it is likely because there are not avenues to do so.

2513,"&gt; We both know you're effectively applying for citizenship, and you're not really Italian (maybe like 1/16th lol).

But that raises the question of what is Italian, or French, or American.  I live in FL.  We have a heavy Spanish population.  Over a quarter of the state is hispanic.  There's plenty that speak English as a second language if at all.  Where I work, our late night cleaning crew speaks pretty much no English.  You will see a lot of Mexican flags being flown and also Puerto Rican flags.  Soccer (as it's called here) is getting more and more popular.

So, if someone isn't white, doesn't speak perfect English, doesn't fly the American flag, and doesn't love baseball first...are they still American?

What about someone in Italy who immigrated 15 years ago from India, married an Indian girl also living in Italy, (both parents legal) and they now have a kid.  He's being raised in Italy, but being taught the Indian language, and is being raised on India food.  Is that kid more Italian than me?


&gt; At least the Italian government made it so you guys can't really vote for anyone of importance.

Care to fill me in?  I'm being honest.  I know I will be able to vote, but is it limited?  BTW, no I won't be voting as I don't feel that's right, just as I know two Americans living in the EU for several years who I don't think should be voting in US elections.

I'm afraid you clearly don't understand, given the extreme naivety of your suggestions above [other readers - scroll up two comments]. If you think anyone can just walk out of their job/family instantly, no regards for anyone they care for, and start in another country, you are sorely mistaken. 

By the way, I see you completely ignored every single counterexample and criticism I raised to your suggestion.

Why did you ignore them? Can you address them, please?

&gt; You say that you got EU citizenship by birth.

I literally didn't say that. 

&gt; Ignoring the fact that there really is no formal EU citizenship separate from that of your country

Why would we ignore it? 

It's literally the entire point of the post. 

It's literally the entire point of the initiative.

&gt; do you suggest that Britons that are born after Brexit will not get it?

This literally isn't the point of the post, the topic, or the initiative, or any of my comments.

I made no such suggestion nor did I raise the issue in any way. 

This initiative addresses the issue of whether citizenship can be stripped away, not the question of how it may be acquired. 

Personally, I think the issue of 'what happens to Britons after Brexit' is a tricky one. There should be some path to acquiring EU citizenship but on which grounds? Birthplace, parentage? Every country in the world has different policies, and every country in the EU does too. Some pass on citizenship only down one side of the parental line. Personally I think there ought to be some way to earn or acquire EU citizenship for everyone who lives in the EU or has EU citizen parents. But who cares what I think?

The important thing is that *your question is entirely irrelevant to the discussion at hand*, it is irrelevant to the initiative in question, and *you only posed it as a way to distract readers from your total lack of answers or response to any of the criticisms I made of your original post*.

Please, try harder to stick to the topic, even when it highlights the weakness of your earlier responses.

In regards of Crimea - Largest part of the people wished to rejoin Russia, I guess it was a democratic decision, even if the rest of the world disliked it and as there weren't any large casualties ... 

And I understand Russia in this case, they could not tolerate to get cut off of their Black Sea access, because of peer pressure induced on Ucraine by the EU and US.

Historically Crimea was also part of Russia since ~1750, which was probably one of the reasons why the people there wished to rejoin Russia.

Actually, to be honest, I didn't go after this, it came to me.  This link was a sponsored ad on Facebook: https://www.westernunion.com/blog/birthright-citizenship-countries/

I skimmed it because I love to travel and have been to like 20 different countries totalling like 6 months overseas.  It listed Italy which caught my eye.  Some quick googling, a check of a family tree, and the rest is soon to be history.  I didn't ""cheese"" anything.  I didn't write the law.  If anything, I admit it's horribly wrong in a sense.  I'm eligible, yet someone who's dad came to the US in 1960, became a citizen in 69, and then had a kid in 70, that kid isn't eligible.  That kid probably knows the language, has grandparents in Italy, etc  They are 100% more ""Italian"" than me, but under Italian law they don't qualify because dad naturalized before the kid was born.  I openly admit that isn't fair...but I didn't write the law.

If it makes you 1% happier, I am looking forwarding to visiting my ancestor's commune here next fall for the Pedavena Croce d'Aune hill climb race.  I'm a huge car guy, so to see where my family came from, plus a cool race, plus I hear they have good beer there... I'm already excited.

2543,"&gt;Yes Georgia, right this was bad, nearly as bad as lying that some country has weapons of chemical mass destruction, invading it and destroying everything even there weren't any, as all controllers stated.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ukraine and Crimea is what I mentioned with formerly Russian influence. But Russia did never advanced towards central Europe and won't do, because of financial interestes, that are mutually beneficial for all parties in Europe (e.g. earth gas business).  
&gt;  
&gt;In regards of Crimea - Largest part of the people wished to rejoin Russia, I guess it was a democratic decision, even if the rest of the world disliked it and as there weren't any large casualties ...  
&gt;  
&gt;And I understand Russia in this case, they could not tolerate to get cut off of their Black Sea access, because of peer pressure induced on Ukraine by the EU and US.  
&gt;  
&gt;Historically Crimea was also part of Russia since \~1750, which was probably one of the reasons why the people there wished to rejoin Russia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Realistically I really don't see the thread from Russia for Europe, it isn't running around the globe starting wars because of dubious reasons, and stays always near it's borders, which are by the way heavily surrounded by the NATO. Also a large scale ware wouldn't benefit Russia at all. I don't think I have to fear them at all.

​And to be perfectly clear. There isn't a fight against an oppressor at Crimea, nor other attacks against Russia, what makes it relatively fair to assume that the majority of people there indeed wished for reintegration with Russia.

So I'm really curios about what Russia is doing that justifies the current media rush? Specifically what did Russia do what other western countries do not?",,/r/europe/comments/99vsls/eu_nato_not_russias_enemies_merkel_says/e4sk8em/,NeoNagapJoe,1535168118

And whoever talks about what's the right or wrong course of action that these immigrants should take... I invite them to go live in lybia, or iraq even only for a year, *then* it would be nice to listen to their opinion, from a prospective based on reality, and not from their comfy sofas.

Truth is, and not many admits, we are motherfucking egoistical. We are few, with many €€€, we can live in luxury! But only if we remain few.

But discontent is spreading, it's like a plague... I doubt we will be able to contain it, the more people born in a poor nation, the more the hate will grow. 

And I *motherfucking hate* how these are shunned off as little problems.

We'll all send the poors away. We'll all keep the cover on the boiling pot. Everyone is acting like some kind of noble from the middle ages, shunning away the disgraceful, just cause we too fancy some riches now!

This, anyway, is just a rant, with no objective... We can't do shit. We'd need a global effort, for the best course of action would be, in my opinion, stop talking about ""them"" and start with ""us"", or maybe find a way to end the *need* for this immigration. Why do they escape their territory? Can we better their territory? Can we make some space here?

2580,"Yes, I did understand. Thank you anyway. I'm going to lay out my opinion. 

Imagine you go live in another country. If you had children, you would probably want them to be able to speak your language, know your culture and if possible, get your nationality, right? If your children get your nationality, they become full-fledged citizens, so their children could also do it. It would just go on through generations.
Even though it is really hard to pass on a language and much of a culture through generations there will probably be always certain affection for the land. 

It is not a really simple process to get a citizenship. If OP chose to have the work (and money for the fees), OP should at least have some affection for Lithuania. 

It is hardly anyone's first choice to immigrate. Normally people do it on troubled times seeking a better life for them and their family. I think it is a really nice and quite romantic gesture to offer their descendants the opportunity to inherit their nationality and give them the possibility to do the same as theirs ancestors, in the opposite direction. 

All of my grand-grandparents came from Europe to Brazil during war time (WWII and the Spanish Civil War), seeking a better life. Although they tried to preserve their language and culture, it was not possible to pass on much beyond their children's generation (it is really hard to pass on language). However, we always had a lot of affection for their homelands. 
A second cousine of mine that had 2 Lithuanian grandparents got her Lithuanian citizenship after a lot of search, time and work. She learned Lithuanian, moved to Vilnius and eventually became a professor of English at a university there. 
I am Brazilian and Spaniard, as I inherited the Spanish citizenship through my family. I have a lot of affection for Spain, and do consider myself Spaniard (and Brazilian). I learned Spanish basically alone until I got fluent (now I am even trying to learn Catalan), and after some time I was finally able to visit Spain. After it, I was able to move to Germany for some time to study, and now I plan to go to Spain and do a masters, after I graduate in Brazil. All of this probably would not have been possible if I didn't have the Spanish citizenship. I feel really grateful for it and hope I can someday contribute in a good way for Spain.

2584,"&gt; The big question is what happens if you shoot a bunch of supersonic anti-ship missiles at it.

But we do have a pretty good idea what will happen. The [Soviet Naval Aviation's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Naval_Aviation#Cold_War) main strategy from the 1960s onwards was exactly as you describe. [Tu-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-22M) bombers with supersonic missiles ([Kh-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-22)) firing mass missile swarms. And the answer to that was longer ranged air-to-air missiles like the [phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-54_Phoenix) and the [Aegis Combat System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis_Combat_System) in sufficient numbers to make the [carrier strike group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_strike_group#Typical_CSG_composition) best defended airspaces on the planet. Fortunately SAM batteries are really cost effective, especially on ship which don't care about power, weight, and bulk like their land versions do.

The attacker has to win air superiority over the [fighter wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_air_wing#Current_Carrier_Air_Wing) (40+ fighters), and at the same time suppress the US Naval equivalent of multiple S-400 SAM batteries networked together on [cruisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticonderoga-class_cruiser) (1-2) and [destoryers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer) (2-3), and finally actually find the ship shoot at it. Now that's not an impossible task, we've seen the US/NATO take on these kind of complex air defences in Vietnam and the Gulf War. But the amount of air power it takes to attack a carrier group is beyond all but a handful of the most powerful nations. And of course in an actual war the US doesn't send one, it sends three or four.

&gt;We also had a number of publicised training exercises, where eg modern swedish, french or german AIP submarines just drove in circles under american carrier groups and didn't get detected.

Yes and like I said to the other commenter those war games are designed to give the subs a chance. No one is going to run a war game where the two sides never find each other or one side gets completely blown away by the other. It's one thing to engage a known target boxed in to a known training area, it's quite another to do it when the whole ocean is up for grabs.

2605,"Ok, it really seems you missed out on parts of what I wrote - I explicitly excluded people in a financial weak position as well as people not of adult age. There are measures in place in most European countries already, explicitly for hygiene products also.

Misinterpretation of reality? You really don't address what I wrote. Letting on group of people without the specific need, pay for another group with the specific need, without letting the former group decide on this is exactly what is defined as force and undemocratic. 

Besides, the money would really be better placed at places where it really is need (helping poor people regardless of sex, and there are more than enough in Europe with the need of more help)

Of course I believe in central services of universal use adressing only issues that are relevant for all people (equality again huh) - anything else can not be justified in a rational way, especially group based benefits (e.g. based on sex). Besides, the current benefits in health-care for women are remainders of a time where they were not supposed to work but get as many children as possible and those benefits have to be removed. Additionally health-care is a really bad case overall, as it is trimmed for profit, leading to too high costs for everyone.

So you could not bring one single argument why it is good that every single taxpayer should pay for women specific  needs through taxes.

Universal taxes should be used solely  to address universal issues - They shouldn't be as high, if this would be realized.

They can start wars within the NATO framework, but participation by member countries is entirely voluntary. The Yugoslavian bombing is one such example, as you pointed out. None of the participants in that war were bound by the NATO treaty to participate.

2619,"&gt; If it was purely mutual defence you would never even hear about it because there's nothing to do.

The treaty itself only binds members to defend each other. It is true that NATO as an organisation does all sorts of things. But participation in those things are voluntary and does not even require membership, as can be seen by Sweden participating in some of them despite not being a member. 

The only thing that changes if Sweden joins NATO is that if Russia attack us the rest of NATO are obliged to help us. Or vice versa, if someone else in NATO is attacked, Sweden is obliged to help them. So unless Russia was planning on attacking NATO there's no reason they should be particularly scared of Sweden joining. If NATO is somehow going to attack Russia now, Sweden are already somewhat likely to join (looking at past NATO operations), so they should have already been prepared for that.

[Battle of Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse) was the greatest loss of prestige for the Royal Navy having the HMS Prince of Wales sunk.

Right now, the way the DF-21 works is that it rockets toward the spot where a carrier was first spotted, there is no onboard radar system to track the target. What a carrier never does is stay still, so it’ll miss 99% of the time.

What would be scary is if the missile contained an independently guided payload that could seek out a carrier sized target using radar, which the Chinese are actually trying to develop for use on a hypersonic glider vehicle. We won’t have to worry about these for a decade, at least.

However, those would in turn be more susceptible to the older anti-missile interceptors (which mostly carried nuclear warheads) like the [Sprint](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(missile)).

2746,"&gt; An ""EU citizen"" is for people in the EU. If your country isn't in the EU then how could you be a citizen?

EU citizenship is unlike any other citizenship in the world at present. Currently, if you are the citizen of one or more countries, it is something that you acquire at birth; through family; or through residency. It carries around with you wherever you go, wherever you live. Citizenship represents both rights and responsibilities to a particular territory. There are (in rare cases) ways that citizenship can be removed, but normally this is only done where the individual has done something so terrible that they are to be rejected fully by their home society. 
 
Right now, I am an EU citizen. I am going to be stripped of this having done nothing wrong, and having fully participated in Europe in most of the ways a citizen can. I don't want to be stripped of it; at every chance I've taken I've tried to stop myself being stripped of it. How can it possibly be fair to throw me out of Europe as an individual? I already spent many years of my life living in European countries, but not enough to qualify for citizenship in any of them. 

&gt;All you need to do is to become a citizen of an EU country and you will be an EU citizen. If you already live in a EU country, then I suggest you start the citizen application process.

""All you need to do""?

Janne, how old are you? Usually when a redditor asks this question they are trying to call someone a child. But in this case, I want to highlight that you surely haven't thought hard about the responsibilities of an adult if you can write such a thing. 

Some of my friends are in the UK just now looking after elderly parents who have dementia. Others, their children are now age 14-17 and they cannot leave without destroying their childs hopes of going to university - one simply cannot change country at a moment's notice with children that age without totally disrupting the process of qualifications and leaving school. Others still are involved in long-term projects in government or research, where they are a key manager or researcher to the project and 'leaving country' means entire projects closing down. I have some younger friends who are partway through their degrees, and can't simply abandon them without losing huge amounts of time and money invested in their education. 

If you are 22, finished your degree, then sure, you can just pack a backpack and go. But we aren't all 22 any more, are we? Some of us have responsibilities to others.

And what of children, too young to leave by themselves in order to retain their citizenship?

And what of those in long-term healthcare in hospital, unable to retain their citizenship?

Surely you're not such a selfish person that you don't give a fuck about caregivers, the old, the sick, the young?

As for 'starting the citizenship process', most countries in Europe require around 5 years residency before you can apply for citizenship. The brexit vote was 2 years ago. Do you have a time machine we can borrow?

Or perhaps everyone in Britain can move to Sweden, where the citizenship requirements are less. I am sure that some 16 million remain voters will not create any problems when they show up at the door.

Finally - how does this solve the broader problem of people having citizenship stripped away? What if Romania announces that they will be closing the borders, and leaving the EU, and their citizens are now going to be stuck there for life? 

Don't you know anything of the history of this continent? Spain &amp; Germany &amp; Austria and Italy have had fascism and tyrrany, Eastern Europe has had communism and tyranny. One way to protect against this kind of risk is guarantee permanent freedoms to everyone in the EU on an individual level to ensure that governments lose the power to bully their own populations and trap them geographically.

I hope this has illustrated to you just a few of the reasons why the viewpoint you posted is over-simplistic and incorrect.

2992,"&gt; They did no such thing. In fact, the Jews represented the wealthiest class in Germany

Bullshit. There were wealthy Jews, but there were many more wealthy Germans that embraced and cooperated with the Nazis, like the Krupp family.

&gt; Also, once again, what about fascism that you said inspired national socialism? Can you spot any differences between it and the socialism in i.e. the USSR?

Fascism is very much like Nazism in its glorification of the past, traditionalist values and rejection of Socialism as well as Liberalism. The only major difference is that Fascism doesn't have quite the same amount of extreme racism. In economic terms, Fascism also followed the 'third way' with State capitalism and corporatism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Corporatist_economic_system 

&gt; When you say socialists want a utopia and natsocs want a dystopia, it sounds like both of them want an utopian pipe dream society along their standards, but the observer considers one to be better than the other.

Maybe you have misread me. I have not claimed that Nazis want a dystopia. Rather, as it comes from Conservatism, modern future is seen as something to fear, which leads the Nazis to actions that would turn into a dystopia. Think the holocaust, for example.

Unlike Socialists or Liberalists, Nazis don't have a utopian vision of the future.

&gt; The quotes of the book by this Reimann fellow cited in the article I linked above directly contradict that when he writes that the government officials inspecting private businesses are obsessed about ""distributing wealth"" and put a lot of pressure on business owners.

Well, it doesn't matter, because they never redistributed wealth in reality. What they did is destroy the unions ASAP, which greatly profited the business owners.

Nazism is the blend of hyper-nationalism, anti-semitism, and fascism (definitively post 1920). Hitler did not create nazism, Hitler found nazism and turned it into his own personal all-encompassing ideology that we now know it as. It is undoubtable that he had an extremely strong influence on nazism, and nazism without Hitler after 1936 would have been unthinkable.

Also, Hitler did not create the anti-semitic and racialist parts of nazi ideology. Those had been a running theme in German radical right parties for decades at least, whether as an expression of jealousy and anger at jewish capitalists' influence in government and economy, or as an expression of the most unsavory parts of 19th century racial theory combined with the aforementioned Völkisch nationalism. Hitler's nazi party definitely brought such racial theories to the fore of nazi ideology, but it had previously still been an important part of the party ideology.

It is important to note that the nazi party before Hitler was hardly worth mentioning. It was through Hitler's rise to power that the party gained strength afaik, not the other way around.",,/r/europe/comments/99qiir/august_23_is_the_european_day_of_remembrance_for/e4rgf62/,Aerda_,1535129658

Also if you use the classic measure for defeat and victory of battlefield control (ok mostly used for land battles, but still) it was a german defeat.

Additionally while the British would have certainly liked to sink a couple of Battleships and cripple the High seas fleet, the most important thing was the continuation of the blockade and that was certainly achieved.

In the last election of the EC president, the Parliament kinda interpreted the 'taking into account EP elections' as their right to propose the candidates and so the spitzenkandidaten process was created where each of the major fraction in the Parliament chose their candidate (except for the reformists who didn't agree with this procedure).

The thing is though that the procedure has no specific bases in law and not everyone in the Council is exactly happy that the Parliament should have this power, so they may decide to just abolish the whole spitzenkandidaten thing.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/99xg8l/merkel_changes_target_in_quest_for_german_eu/e4rh8nf/,kristynaZ,1535130327

The carrier's size deceives so many people into thinking it's vulnerable. The supercarriers are enormous pieces of compartmentalized steel. Unlike the UK versions, the supercarriers are powered by a miniaturized nuclear reactor. It can move constantly with no need to refuel. Their top speed is 56km/h. By the time its foe acquires its location and gets a missile there, it's probably 20-100km away. Despite the inherently effective defense of constant movement, they are surrounded by a ring of steel: two different types of battle cruisers, one usually focusing on anti-submarines, the other for surface defense. The latter is outfitted with the best anti-missile system in the world, AEGIS. So even if its foe gets lucky and guesses the right location, this ship can shoot missiles from the sky before they hit the carrier. Lurking below all of this are subs that can surface and fire their long-range arsenals at anything the carrier wants destroyed, assuming 70 advanced aircraft (many of them stealth and undetectable) don't get there first.

It doesn't matter what Russia *think* NATO is up to, when neither NATO or Sweden has talked about any sort of military action against Russia, you don't tell them you're going to point more guns at them. The only thing the west is talking about in regards to Russia is *defense*, it's as if the ambassador believes the propaganda of his own government. 

&gt; talking about joining a military alliance which is hostile to Russia is a threat

Talking about joining a defensive military alliance who has no power to start offensive wars is not a threat, regardless of that alliance's relationship with Russia. How could it be a threat? If NATO wants to start a war against Russia and Sweden wants to help them we can already do that, nothing is stopping us. The only thing us joining NATO is doing is assuring that the rest of NATO comes to our aid in case we are *attacked*, and assuring that we come to other NATO countries aid in case they are *attacked*. If a NATO country starts a war Sweden has no more obligation to join that war no matter if we are in or out of NATO. 

[Here's an interesting interview in Swedish ""mainstream media"" with the Russian foreign minister](https://fokus.dn.se/lavrov/). I may be deceived by their cunning propaganda, but I really don't think they are hiding or warping much information. I'm pretty sure we have a decently clear picture of what Russia is telling the world. It's possibly our own government(s) that is hiding stuff, but it's not to a very great extent, that is just conspiracy theories. 

Our military is certainly hiding stuff about Russian activities against us. Considering how much of a fuss they are constantly making about it without actually showing many specific things that Russia has done. But that's pretty much reverse propaganda if anything.

3265,"&gt; The BTGs don't have enough mechanised infantry or tanks to work on their own, and they have a disproportionately large amount of artillery- they're designed purely to fight in one place at a time using their huge attached batteries. Without the militia they'd be unable to keep a reserve to guard their flanks.

It's a tactical unit, of course it cannot conduct operations on its own. That's not really anything specific to the organization of the BTG. If one unit can't accomplish a task by itself, then the task requires a few more. 

In the end, the BTG is a beefed up battalion. It punches well above its weight if used correctly, but it is not a substitute for a higher order formation. 

The Russians used BTGs in Ukraine exclusively, because they limited themselves to using contract soldiers, and because their regulars are not the bulk of the army that's fighting there. 

Even if whole brigades were deployed, BTGs would still be formed if the situation requires it, it's a very natural thing to mix tanks and mechanized infantry inside the brigade itself, making these mixed battalions, and then at a point of decision, the whole brigade support throws itself behind a battalion, and viola. Russians just recognized this tendency and formalized the whole thing. 

&gt;Edit: I see what you mean. By 'integrated' I meant that the Russian regulars are dependent on them to function- 
&gt;I meant my comment to show that the Russians support and actively fight alongside the militias as part of an invasion, as opposed to say a US BCT which fights independently.

Okay, but the militia forms the actual bulk of the fighting force. They're not in a screening role, they are the army. 

The Russians come in at decision points and act as a force multiplier. 

&gt;I didn't mean to imply they share command beyond informal arrangements between BTG commander and militia. 

And if they do, they shared it at a higher level. Some officer contact is normal when they're in the same place at the same time, but that's about it.

3268,"No the calculations did not include all these things and as stated made assumptions that can be argued to be incorrect.  Adjusting the assumptions for more realistic assumptions results in a slight net benefit reducing to a loss of near 30 billion each year.

Regarding housing, yes we do have an issue with building homes even if you removed the net 300k  a year migrants.  So adding 300k each year is not going to help is it?

As I said there are a number of things you can do to increase the population without mass migration.  Though it’s not the answer.

I agree business should be less centralised around big cities but it is.  Without some kind of family background there is no incentive for migrants to move out of the cities.  In fact it’s the native white population that tend to move away from the city.  If that is because of racism, communities changing too fast or people just cashing in, I don’t have that answer.

Liverpool a place I know well only has a surplus of housing in places that people don’t want to live in.  More and more apartments are springing up every day.

The fact remains migrants want to live around the cities.  Work is easy to find there and enclaves form with their own cultures.  Massive investment needs to be taken to build house for the 300k per year and it would need to be driven by social housing.

3280,"&gt; Binding and non-binding is a technicality when they explicitly tell you over and over again it’s final, but yeah semantics. 

Well no, they can only say once that it's binding.

&gt;There was technically the option for government to ignore the will of the people but that was never going to happen as popular opinion is how they get their jobs. Saying ‘the people want this, but I don’t’ is how you end a career in politics quick sharp.

It's always an option to say ""I cannot in good conscience support this disaster and will sacrifice my career if necessary"", which may get you lauded as a visionary and rekindle your career later. But yeah, at the very least you should arrange for some other occupation in the meantime and vindication is far from guaranteed. Still, if you're having a honest conviction, it's a real option.

&gt;Honestly you lost me at the part about how we should have as many referendums as it takes until you get the result you want. What is this keep doing it over and over until you make up your mind? You make up your mind and vote, life doesn’t always give you another juice box if you spill yours. 

I didn't say that. You can have multiple referendums as needed in response to changing public opinions and circumstances. Unless you said beforehand it was binding. Hell, if the first referendum on EU membership was binding for eternity, it was impossible to hold a Brexit referendum. So you implicitly acknowledge the possibility of changing one's mind after a referendum; at most you disagree about the time period.

&gt;How can I hate brexit and not be agreeing with you that we should be doing whatever it takes to stop it happening? Because what we’re talking about is messing with the fundamental principles of our democracy and the will of the people because we didn’t get our way, and has the potential to be far more dangerous than brexit.

The fundamental principle of democracy is that there should be open debate and people can and should change their mind if necessary.

3310,"**The French satirical magazine has once again attracted the ire of Italian politicians for its controversial take on a national tragedy.**

The latest cover of the magazine features a cartoon that tenuously links Italy's migration issues with the [collapse of the bridge](https://www.thelocal.it/20180820/new-video-genoa-morandi-bridge-collapse) in northern Italy. It depicts a black worker sweeping below the remains of the collapsed Morandi Bridge as cars fall to the ground. 

The caption reads: ""Built by Italians...cleaned by migrants."" 

The cartoon has provoked angry reactions from several Italian politicians as the city of Genoa continues to grieve the [death of 43 people](https://www.thelocal.it/20180819/genoa-death-toll-hits-43-as-missing-family-found) who died when the Morandi Bridge collapsed on August 14th. 

Edoardo Rixi, Italy's vice-minister for transport and a Ligurian, led the calls of disgust. 

""The French newspaper Charlie Hebdo is shameless and manages to surpass every limit of bad taste. Would this be satire? For me there is only one word: Disgusting,"" posted Rixi on Facebook in reaction to the cartoon. 

Italian Senator Marco Marsilio demanded the French ambassador be summoned and asked to intervene by Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [reports](http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/08/23/foto/ponte_morandi_copertina_al_vetriolo_di_charlie_hebdo-204724934/1/#1) Repubblica.

This isn't the first time Charlie Hebdo's depiction of a sensitive Italian event has outraged Italians. In 2016, the French satirical weekly upset many Italians with its cynical [cover about the earthquake](http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/02/esteri/charlie-hebdo-la-vignetta-sul-terremoto-in-italia-2zOEXJ1r7bSFqp4hSjhk4M/pagina.html) in Amatrice in which 299 people died. Amatrice went on to sue the magazine.

In 2017, Charlie Hebdo again took aim at an Italian tragedy when it made fun of avalanche victims. The mayor of Amatrice, Sergio Pirozzi, responded by [encouraging Italians to draw their own cartoons in response](https://www.thelocal.it/20170123/italy-hits-back-at-charlie-hebdo-avalanche-cartoon).

One response showed an emergency relief worker holding a child and putting out his hand to stop the grim reaper on skis depicted in the magazine's original cartoon. 

Charlie Hebdo isn't afraid to offend, having previously published cartoons, for example, depicting the Islamic Prophet Mohammed – a major taboo in Islam. 

Twelve people died including several of France's most popular cartoonists in an [attack](https://www.thelocal.fr/20150107/paris-terror-attack-charlie-hebdo-victims) on Charlie Hebdo's Paris office on January 7th, 2015.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/99weq1/charlie_hebdo_enrages_italy_with_cartoon_about/e4qveq3/,nibaneze,1535108069

3314,"Brussels has hit out at “finger pointing” and “threats” from Italy’s Eurosceptic government over a stand-off about the fate of 150 migrants on a boat stranded in the Mediterranean since last weekend.

Rome’s populist alliance has demanded other EU countries take their share of 150 migrants on the Diciotti coastguard vessel that has been docked since Sunday. Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement and deputy prime minister, today threatened to pull Italy’s contribution to the EU budget if a solution is not found.

“We won’t be messed around by other EU countries,” Mr Di Maio told Italian television on Friday. “We give €20bn a year to the EU and we get back a little more than €10bn. We want to be net contributors to the EU but only if there is a willingness to help us in a reciprocal way. This means no more pushing us around on immigration”.

The commission has called an emergency meeting of 12 governments to discuss the fate of the Diciotti and other measures to distribute refugees across member states in Brussels today.

Responding to Mr Di Maio’s budget comments, a spokesman for the European Commission said Brussels was determined to find a solution to the migrant impasse and would not respond to threats.

“Lets not engage in finger pointing. Unconstructive comments, let alone threats, are not helpful. Threats don’t work in Europe. They don’t get you anywhere”, said the spokesman. “We would call on all parties involved to work constructively together”.

EU governments have been divided over the best way to handle migration policy in recent months. European leaders in June agreed to set up “disembarkation platforms” outside the EU to take migrants rescued at sea and process their asylum claims.

&gt;Russians in Estonia are non-native illegal immigrants, how can you even compare this situation with the indigenous Catalans???

Including those whose families have lived there for generations now? Wow. You are the worst kind of racist-nativist, and you still have the gall to lecture me about democracy. 

There is no such thing as ""indigenous catalans"" either. You are turning a political issue into an ethnic one. Josep Borrell is one of the foremost unionist politicians but he is as catalan as he gets, while Gabriel Rufian is one of the leaders of ERC despite being the son of andalusian immigrants. However, according to you, the first is a non-catalan, while the second is a native catalan. Get this into your head: *even the vast majority of catalan independentists (not crazy racist fanatics like Erratic) believe this to be racist and unacceptable*. Their position had always been that anyone who lives in Catalonia is catalan, no questions asked. 

Stop meddling in countries you clearly know nothing about.

3519,"As far as i could see, right at the end of the video there was a man and a women who were ""slapping and jeering"" the POWs as the youtube description put it. They had another 3 or 4 with them who appeared to be of same view. God only knows what their sentiments were. They might be fascist, or german, or paid, or any number of things. I would say german if i had to guess. The blonde teenager behind the short man appears to be part of that group and has a distinctly 'cadet' look about him. Thats just guesswork though.

The youtube description says it is paris in 1944, although i am not knowledgable enough to verify that from the contents. 1944 is most likely, however if it is indeed paris then it would have to have been shot sometime between d-day on 6th june, and the liberation of paris on 25th august. There is plenty of footage of the reception in paris when the allies arrived, which is at most two months after this, and more likely a couple of weeks later.

There is a shot of what looks like the Gare du Nord, which would put it in paris. But you dont actually see any POWs in that shot. (Edit: actually you can also see a signpost they are marching past at 0:52 which appears to read Gare du Nord, so that would strongly suggest it is indeed paris)

There's also a scuffle at the 2:10 mark, but again there's no POWs in that shot.

Anyway, it's a propaganda piece. I wouldnt read too much into it. The nazis produced tonnes of propaganda. It's an interesting lens into that period of time, but i wouldnt take away any ideas about french sentiments post d-day.

There is nothing wrong with nationalism. It provides a strong sense of community, perspective, and culture. It gives a reason to come together and work towards something. It preserves languages and people. It can be a source of great beauty and cohesion.

With that said states have to be realistic, and things like the EU provide a way for them to work together, and actually have some sway. The single market increases their wealth, and being a member of it gives them a say.

Closing the external borders must be done, to preserve cohesion and culture, but revolting against the EU itself is unnecessary and unwise. There can be a middle ground.

""The Separatist War in Donbas: A Violent Break-Up of Ukraine?"" 
SEPARATIST!!! from what time Russian army are separatist? 

&gt;The protests were sparked by the Ukrainian government's decision to suspend signing an association agreement with the European Union and instead choosing closer ties to Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union.
LIE. 
No every one knows that noone cares about any association agreement with the European Union. It was revolution against Donetsk Mafia. 

&gt;This is not enough evidence of common usage of the greeting before UPA times.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Synagogue#2006_shooting_attack

""A Molotov cocktail was thrown at the Beth Hillel Liberal synagogue in Brussels. Rocks and other objects were thrown at a Jewish school. A Jewish home was the subject of an attempted arson.[53] Afterwards, hundreds of protesters tried to march towards the Jewish neighborhood but were held off by police.""

""A 28-year-old Palestinian male opened fire on a three Israeli cosmetics salesmen and two customers in a shopping mall on 31 December 2008. The shooting, which followed a period of harassment against the cosmetic stand, resulted in two Israelis being hit by shots. The perpetrator explained that he was motivated by the Middle Eastern situation. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.[55""

""Sixty-six antisemitic incidents were reported during the conflict in France, home to Europe's largest Muslim and Jewish populations. Numerous synagogues were attacked with petrol bombs and damaged in various towns.[56] In Toulouse a car was rammed into the gates of a synagogue and set on fire.[57] Leila Shahid, the Palestinian envoy to the European Union, said the ""awful incident"" was a result of images from Gaza.[58] In Saint-Denis a petrol bomb was thrown at a synagogue which set fire to an adjacent Jewish restaurant.[3] Offensive graffiti was also daubed on synagogues throughout the country. In Paris a rabbi's car was torched,[59] a Jewish student was attacked and stabbed four times by Arab youths[60][61] and a 15-year-old Jewish girl was assaulted by a gang of 10 youths.[62]""

""A Jewish community center in Rostock was daubed and later stoned.[63] The Central Council of Jews in Germany reported a significant increase in the number of hate mails and death threats during the conflict.[64]""

""A Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Jewish-owned building in Amsterdam, following an attempted arson of a Jewish institution in Arnhem. A synagogue in Haaksbergen and a Jewish-owned building in Oss were targeted by stoning.[68] At an anti-Israel demonstration in Utrecht, some demonstrators shouted ""Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas"", a reference to the Holocaust era gas chambers.[69] Two men were convicted in the incident.[70] Dutch MP Harry van Bommel participated in the demonstration, leading to a complaint to the Dutch Justice Ministry accusing the parliamentarian of incitement to hate, violence and discrimination against Jews. According to Ha'aretz, in an online video van Bommel's voice can be heard while protesters chanted. Van Bommel told Haaretz he did not hear the calls, and that he would have left had he heard them.[71]""

""In the 2009 Oslo riots, Muslim youth attacked the Israeli embassy and yelled anti-Jewish slogans in Arabic, including ""Death to the Jews"", ""Kill the Jews"" and ""Slaughter the Jews."" In one incident, young Muslims beat a 73-year-old man who was carrying an Israeli flag, while shouting ""Bloody Jew – get him!"" They only stopped attacking him when they realized he was a non-Jewish Norwegian.[72]

In his book The Anti-Jewish Riots in Oslo, Norwegian author and editor Eirik Eiglad wrote:[72]

As far as I can judge, these were the largest anti-Jewish riots in Norwegian history. Even before and during World War II, when anti-Semitic prejudices were strong, public policies were discriminatory, and the Nazified State Police efficiently confiscated Jewish property and deported Jews on that despicable slave ship SS Donau – even then, Norway had not seen anti-Jewish outbursts of this scale. This country had no previous history of wanton anti-Jewish mass violence.""

""A Jewish burial chapel in Malmö was the target of an arson attack and Jewish center in Helsingborg was set alight twice in three days.[40]

""

""The number of antisemitic incidents during the conflict numbered approximately 225, according to the Community Security Trust. This represents eight times the number of incidents recorded in the same period last year.[73] 11 incidents involved physical violence; 13 synagogues were daubed and 20 Jewish buildings other than synagogues were also daubed. More than half the total have been incidents of abuse, both verbal and by email or post.[74] Brondesbury Park Synagogue in Willesden was damaged after an attempted firebombing and a gang of between 15 and 20 youths rampaged in Golders Green trying to force their way into Jewish restaurants and shops, specifically focusing their abuse on the London Jewish Family Centre; a Jewish motorist was also dragged from his car and assaulted.[75][76] Anti-Semitic graffiti with slogans including 'Kill Jews', 'Jews are scumbags' and 'Jihad 4 Israel' were also sprayed in Jewish areas across London and Manchester.[77][78] Police stepped up security in Jewish neighborhoods, and members of the Jewish community were reported to have fled the country because of safety fears.[79] High-ranking Foreign Office diplomat Rowan Laxton was arrested after allegedly launching an antisemitic tirade in a gym, while watching television reports of the Israeli attack in Gaza (when the case went to appeal, it was decided by a judge and two magistrates that Laxton had not made the comment on which the prosecution relied).[80][81] The Metropolitan Police reported four times as many anti-Jewish incidents following the conflict as Islamaphobic events.[82]""

It's incredibly difficult to coordinate the efforts of those very many people in a way that is conducive to the whole. That's what governments have always attempted to accomplish, with varying degrees of success.

You know that saying, people judge other by their actions and themselves by their intentions? That's basically what communism is. It's an ideal that is incompatible with reality, with human nature. But that's ok, because the other systems aren't working towards *the ideal*. Their failures are unjustifiable, cruel even. While ours are outside of our control, or caused by the wicked, or *necessary*. Because if we can just get to that place, then all will be well and strife will end forever.

But it won't. Because that's not how people work. People are greedy and cruel. They'll fuck it up just so they can have a little bit more. Or even just because they can, because it's more interesting that way, or they don't know how to do anything else. It's quite the mistake to make to assume that just because people's needs are met, that means they'll fall in line and be good people. I've personally seen that not to be true in many different ways.

Capitalism isn't perfect, but it doesn't try to be. Because it can't, just like everything else.

I think the argument for borders is a pragmatic one. You're right it is un-libertarian, but libertarians who purity spiral look ridiculous. Have you seen a libertarian party conference recently? Some concessions must be made pragmatically, both to garner broader support and to maintain a libertarian society. Once a libertarian society is established, we can slowly dismantle it. We need to sort our shit out and shut our borders, then we can argue the merits of purity.

One of the main de facto libertarian arguments for hard borders is that to minimize state spending, if there us a welfare state, one cannot have open borders. You are right, the intellectually consistent solution is to abolish the welfare state, however, a pragmatist has to realise that won't happen and shutting the borders may be the more realistic option.

3844,"&gt;Is there anyone actually who would consider Belarus to be anything else than a Russian puppet state?

Umm... Yes? Anyone with any info on Belarus at all? FYI, Belarus has been playing both sides since 2014, barely staying on a right side of our Russian alliance, while also fucking with Russian sanctions, creating such well-known memes as ""Belarussian shrimp"" in the meantime (repackaging EU foodstuffs). Generally speaking, our relationship with Russia is loose enough for us to have a mini-trade war with Russia almost yearly, until Lukashenko and Putin meet again and calm things down. It's not like EU, unfortunately, and there's still a lot of room for disagreement and discrimination. 

&gt;Let's be real now. I would've argued the same about Ukraine some years ago, but they stood up against that.

Which would make anyone even slightly informed laugh at your face, because everyone knows that Ukraine has always kept Russia at arm's length, starting with Black Sea fleet division in 1991-92. The association agreement was procured by Yanukovich, supposedly the Russian puppet ;) who backed out of it due to figuring out what effect it would have on the Ukrainian economy. Well, EU and US wouldn't forgive him that, and the rest is history. 

&gt;On all the people of Belarus? No, I don't recall offending anyone from there. 

Re-read your comments from the start. 

&gt;You're part of the same New Europe, I don't know why you keep using that weird term tbh. 

Perhaps it was before your time. Bush used that term to divide fanatically loyalist Eastern Europeans from normal countries like France and Germany, calling the former ""New Europe"" as in better, future Europe, during the build-up to the Iraq War. He also used the same places as torture bases, so it's kind of an insult nowadays. Feel free to be offended ;). 

&gt;I'm not teaching you how to live, I don't recall giving you life advice.

You told us to break away from a country that we have pretty much no differences with and have more common history than you have with Bessarabia. And insist on that being the only way to live. Well, in my country, this opinion has about 5% support, with negative tendency of growth. 

&gt;A pseudo-dictatorship, but Belarus kinda is, yes. 

Based on what? We don't have roving bands of fascists trying to kill every person on some online blacklist, unlike our awesome southern neighbours. Yet you clearly see their government change as a positive development and would want something similar to happen to us. Ugh... 

&gt;Again, judging people for what governments and international organizations do. You must be fun at parties. 

I'm great at parties, people all over invite me to all major events. I'm hugely entertaining and generally extraverted when drunk, not that it matters in this conversation... 

As far as you are concerned - I'm judging you based on your stated beliefs, nothing else. If you vocally disagreed with the actions of your state - I'd most certainly have no problem with you. Unfortunately, you seem more radically pro-American and fanatically Russophobic than Bucharest is generally. Hence... 

&gt;Yeah. You wanna get away from Russia, then Russia will fuck you over bigtime, start waging war on your territory and make sure you will never join NATO or the EU with such a conflict. 

Read something at least semi-neutral about the Ukrainian conflict, before passing ridiculous judgements of this sort. I've followed Ukraine since the late 90s and am fully aware of the developing and more-and-more radical conflict that happened there over the last few decades. 2004 election first showed how dramatically divided that country was, with votes for candidates splitting very neatly on the map, with 90%+ for Yushchenko at the extreme in the west, and 90%+ for Yanukovich at the other extreme in the east. Nothing much changed since - Yanukovich actually did win after the end of his opponent's term, until a violent coup dethroned him in 2014 - with protests happening (and succeeding) almost exclusively in regions where Yanukovich always lost. The first thing the coup leaders (who were supported by various fascist movements) was removing even regional status from Russian - which only had this status in regions where these people had near-zero numbers of votes. People who elected overthrown president felt like their votes were stolen and now their democracy was trampled on - some rebelled. They were stupid - I'll grant you that - the right thing would be not to break away but to declare themselves to be **the** government. However - they didn't. The fact is that with the type of people Kiev called to put the rebellion down, Ukrainian victory would lead to a massacre. Russia, therefore, helped. Though not really much... 

One-sided? Somewhat, sure. But at least factually correct. I really am sympathetic to the rebels. In fact, if an equivalent government came to power here - I'd rebel too. And Russians helped - NATO did the same in an equivalent situation in Libya, with far shittier consequences... 

&gt;The EU never promised Ukraine membership, it was just a trade deal that Russia couldn't stand and decided to fuck all of Ukraine for that. 

Wrong. Russia just couldn't stand foreign meddling to replace semi-friendly government with a fanatically hostile one. So it took over the part where it had nearly 100% support (due to ethnically Russian population), and helped rebellion in regions where this new government had near-zero support. 

&gt;I agree, leaving momma Russia won't be easy, you need to wait for some normal president or weaker time for Russia to get away from them, as the 90s were for the Baltic countries.

Again - nobody is planning to feed any breakaways anymore. At all! The most they'll do now is keep them afloat. 

&gt;They might have a chance in fact, by joining Romania. It won't happen since the Russian propaganda there is strong though.

Heh, not really. Most of the Slavic population conveniently broke away as Transdniestria, so the people that don't want to join you now are native Bessarabians. 

&gt;You're just hilarious. Romania doesn't depend on America for anything basically, we do have our own military.

It's not about real need - I know they don't do shit for Europe. I'm not talking specifically about you anyway - the whole EU falls into this category that seems to follow the US into various bullshit for no good reason. When Europe ceases with ""Atlantic solidarity"" and other nonsense, I'm fairly certain our relationship will improve rapidly. It's easy to come to a mutual agreement between two sides, it's the third one that creates instability due to it not having any interest in Russo-European detente (since then they won't be needed). 

I think that once Europe gets into some conflict with the Americans, we'll quickly split Ukraine and agree on all the lesser issues. After that, this mini-cold war will be remembered only as temporary bad dream. At least I hope so - it would be better for everyone - but I guess we'll see. 

&gt;Belarus depends on Russia on all levels, they can end your economy whenever they want. 

Sure, and Germany could end your economy if they wanted. So what? What possible reason would they have to attack their closest ally? 

&gt;The circle is kinda closing down though. Trading with Russia and some other ruined economies won't lift Belarus too much. Trading with EU countries and the US might instead.

Hehe... You're clearly not aware of recent developments ;). We've been making *bank* on these recent conflicts. Everything that goes around Ukraine (ie. everything) goes through us now. Ukraine is planning to cut all travel to Russia now, that's travel of 5 million Ukrainians through Belarus (our population is 10M)... We're doing okay. All the EU-Russia-Ukraine trade is now ours.

...trust me, I know! It's lucrative as fuck. You won't come close to banking as much as some of us do nowadays - ever ;). ",Belarus,/r/europe/comments/99hr91/scripts_of_europe/e4q7wtn/,idio3,1535072988

Same can be asked by a thief when he goes to prison. 

&gt;We are not the united states where farms still use crop pickers

I mean you say that, but I think berry-picking is the most common job for foreign EU workers here. Picking strawberries is a common summer job in at least parts of the country. My friend had a barn full of Poles each summer who came to pick strawberries. But he was a weird one. 

Anyway, there is more than farms in the countryside. At least in Sweden. It's true that there are more jobs in the bigger cities. But there are other reasons why settling all the refugees in the cities is not the best idea. Extreme lack of housing for example, but also space in child care, schools and healthcare. The countryside is better at handling all of that. Also, I would like to point out that most of the refugees are actually settled in the big cities here. But they are also spread out over the country to make the burden more even. 

&gt;Why not help people like you and I rather than take a gamble and accept someone from anywhere else?

I don't need much more help than I already get. Easier to aquire rental apartments or cheaper housing would be nice, but that's about it, otherwise I'm fine. But at least in the case of Sweden I don't see why we can't do both. 

&gt;I would never subject refugees to ""work"", give them comfy homes and protection, even fund their return home when it's safe. We could even set up a safe zone in Syria or Libya for a fraction of the cost of housing them in our countries.

What the fuck are they gonna do though? Sit around rolling their thumbs? Housing them isn't costing us much when they get jobs. That's the whole point with the whole integration thing. When they have jobs they don't cost as anything any more, they even help the economy. They help the economy slightly anyway just by consuming stuff, but when their income is government subsidies that just takes the money right back out again, so yeah.

As someone well outside the overton window with an ideology that has actually been censored for a long time, having part of the public opinion against you and organizations refusing to entertain is nothing in comparison. 

Btw you can say stuff outside of 'free speech zones', it's mainly protesters being walled into a government-designated area if you look at the worst ones, which is something I heavily disagree with, but that's pretty different from smoking areas. Also most of the worst ones are outside campuses and some of the better ones are just places where actions can be organized from beforehand and have been there since the 60's. There's a wide range in function, so I'll just assume you mean the worst ones: It's a very American thing to call all of them free speech zones. It's not the containment of free speech, it's the containment of public order and that's also how they're seen in other countries (like mine) where there are different names for them. But in the US they always have to market things as 'American Values^^tm' like it being pro-free speech. But in general, it's not 'you can only say certain stuff in here'. It's not repression of free speech; it's repression of freedom of movement and the freedom to protest. 

Overall, it's not defending free speech that is racism. There often is a context when someone is defending free speech, and on the internet right now it seems like they're (freely) speaking out against people criticizing them. They're actively creating a myth of oppression around right-wing ideas even though the western world has always been dominated by right-wing ideas and still is. In the US you've got a party of centrists that tries to compromise with the right and is actively shifting the overton window in that direction, and a party that's moving more and more into full on far-right territory. Similar tendencies are seen all over Europe and other white-majority places. The idea that those views are being oppressed is laughable. People want to stop the spread of it, for good reason. They're not entitled to use platforms of others as a means to indoctrinate the youth. Denying those platforms is not a limitation of free speech.

Is there anyone actually who would consider Belarus to be anything else than a Russian puppet state? Let's be real now. I would've argued the same about Ukraine some years ago, but they stood up against that.

&gt;but you seem to seriously believe that getting dragged out of the hole in the 90s-00s somehow makes you superior and qualified to look down on us

On all the people of Belarus? No, I don't recall offending anyone from there. As opposed to you, I don't judge people based on the government's actions. I called the country a puppet, not the people. 

&gt; I've certainly seen enough of this type of shit back then in Poland, where I have spent a considerable amount of time.

Don't take out your frustration on me then. 

&gt;Now, in my 30's, I'm suddenly being taught how to live by students from ""New Europe"" who weren't alive under Communism they hate so much

You're part of the same New Europe, I don't know why you keep using that weird term tbh. I'm not teaching you how to live, I don't recall giving you life advice. Sure I hate communism since absolutely all communist countries that were under Soviet influence are shitholes and much poorer than their Western counterparts. That's one of the reasons. Having family deported to Siberia by Soviets and growing up in a family that was brutalized by communist authorities for not being ignorant peasants make me think this way. Not to mention the fact that my parents went to 1989 revolution willing to give their life for a change and didn't back down when the army was shooting in the crowds. I cant support a regime that tried to kill my family at all times. 

&gt; it's still a communist dictatorship.

Yeah. You wanna get away from Russia, then Russia will fuck you over bigtime, start waging war on your territory and make sure you will never join NATO or the EU with such a conflict. The EU never promised Ukraine membership, it was just a trade deal that Russia couldn't stand and decided to fuck all of Ukraine for that. I agree, leaving momma Russia won't be easy, you need to wait for some normal president or weaker time for Russia to get away from them, as the 90s were for the Baltic countries.

They might have a chance in fact, by joining Romania. It won't happen since the Russian propaganda there is strong though.

You're just hilarious. Romania doesn't depend on America for anything basically, we do have our own military. We depend on them on defense against Russia since we simply don't have the means for it. Economically, politically, socially speaking, we do not depend on them at all. Belarus depends on Russia on all levels, they can end your economy whenever they want. America can't really do that here, we're not dependent on them, we truly are in an alliance with them. The EU could, but they could do that to any country basically. 

&gt;We have our own alliances and economic zones with people whom we trust and have common cultural affinity.

3973,"&gt;What's wrong with the Bundeswehr?

&gt;Bartels pointed to ""big gaps"" in personnel and equipment. At the end of 2017, no submarines and none of the air force's 14 large transport planes were available for deployment due to repairs.
Other equipment, including fighter jets, tanks and ships, was outdated and in some cases not fully operational because of bad planning or a lack of spare parts. Some air force pilots were unable to train because too many aircraft were being repaired.
Soldiers have experienced increasing levels of stress and there was a lack adequate leadership due to some 21,000 vacant officer posts.
The report said the government needed to pursue reforms ""with greater urgency"" and increase defense spending.
A lack of funding and inefficient management structures and planning were behind the problems. Germany has cut defense spending since the end of the Cold War. In 2017, it spent about 1.2 percent of its economic production in 2017 on the armed forces, which is below the 2 percent target recommended by the NATO alliance. - https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-lack-of-military-readiness-dramatic-says-bundeswehr-commissioner/a-42663215

Or

&gt;The Bundeswehr is due to take over leadership of NATO's multinational Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) at the start of next year, but doesn't have enough tanks, the Defense Ministry document said.

&gt;Specifically, the Bundeswehr's ninth tank brigade in Münster only has nine operational Leopard 2 tanks — even though it promised to have 44 ready for the VJTF — and only three of the promised 14 Marder armored infantry vehicles.

&gt;The paper also revealed the reason for this shortfall: a lack of spare parts and the high cost and time needed to maintain the vehicles. It added that it was also lacking night-vision equipment, automatic grenade launchers, winter clothing and body armor. - https://www.dw.com/en/german-military-short-on-tanks-for-nato-mission/a-42603112

Or

&gt;But ahead of the final vote, a military report saying that less than half of its arsenal of Tornados was actually ready for deployment surfaced. Out of 93 commissioned fighter jets, only 66 were operational in general terms and only 29 were combat-ready at the current time.

&gt;While a general inspection last year had revealed that 58 percent of the Tornado aircraft were ready for deployment, the number for this year had fallen to 44 percent. The chiefs of staff for the German armed forces recommend running at 70 percent capacity. - https://www.dw.com/en/less-than-half-of-german-air-force-fleet-ready-for-deployment/a-18889822

4010,"&gt;  It is not called life sentence here

Of course. Because we speak German. It's a 'lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe' in German. Which basically translates to life sentence. 

&gt; StGB Paragraph 38
&gt; 
&gt; (1) Die Freiheitsstrafe ist zeitig, wenn das Gesetz nicht **lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe** androht.  
&gt; (2) Das Höchstmaß der zeitigen Freiheitsstrafe ist fünfzehn Jahre, ihr Mindestmaß ein Monat.

----

&gt; what life sentence effectively means in Germany is 25 Years of prison.

It means to serve a minimum of 15 years before you can obtain parole. If and when you obtain parole depends on the imprisoned individual. You could certainly stay in prison until you die, German law allows that. There are no caps at 25 years. The average for released prisoners is somewhere around 19 years. 

The longest serving prisoner currently imprisoned in Germany is already serving 56 years. And he's not in Sicherheitsverwahrung (preventive detention). He's on a lifelong sentence in regular prison.

Don't be so sure since it was that left made capitalism tamed and far more humane for some at least at the end of the day.

&gt; Your point is phrased in a way that makes it difficult to see your point. If we judge solely by original intent, Napoleon was a hero of the Republic who fought back against the Monarchs of Europe trying to smother Democracy in it's crib. But we all know that didn't last for long. The USSR didn't start with Stalinism in mind, but it devolved into it, as did China with Maoism, as did Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge, Ethiopia with the Derg, and many more.

And republicanism went into Napoléonism and French imperialism, national liberation and republicanism of the US went into racism, slavery, genocides, expensionism and imperialism, parlementarism in the Britain ended up with puritan Christian religious oppression and colonisation of Ireland. I won't be saying that's parlementarism or republicanism or national independence though, or the outcomes were more important than the intents.

Venezuela since Chavez was a Social Democratic economy. As in it was a capitalist country with a welfare state. Those policies have been around in Europe for a long time and they brought in the best standards of living that the continent has ever seen. Venezuela's primary problems were that this was mismanaged and the money for this welfare state was reliant on the world's dirtiest oil reserves. When oil prices dropped the money ran out and now Venezuela's going through their struggles.

This paragraph is uncomfortably accurate to the situation. The biggest threat is that when Trump gets impeached, EU politicians will declare ""mission accomplished"", as if Trump being removed  somehow resolves the original problems being too militarily unprepared, underfunded, and dependent on USA. There is a small global sadness about this situation. The world would be far more stable if all democratic countries didn't depend so much on America for defense. Trump's bad behavior should not be used as an excuse to cut security funding vitally important to national security. :/",Singapore,/r/europe/comments/99nv29/europe_should_scale_up_military_spending_in_order/e4pk2qx/,singabro,1535050753

&amp;#x200B;

Oh really? Is that what helped? I forgot it was the EU who made Russians leave and people revolt against their government. So silly of me to think that Polish people did that because they wanted and not because magical EU told them to. But you are right, them being a satelite state of CCCP had nothing to do with them being unatractive for foreign ivnestments before...

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Neither Germany nor Spain governments ignored a constitutional court ruling. Taking nomination power away from judges to give it directly to the government and reducing retirement age to forcefully take down the head of the constitutional court are not reforms, or controversial its obvious that PIS is power grabbing and although I do not equate it to Hungary, PIS has moved much quicker and is illegitimately solidifying its power by gerrymandering and using public channels as a party propaganda tool.

&amp;#x200B;

That is what you are saying, also opposition, but Poles seem to somewhat trust their government and unless they actually fudge next election you cannot say they are doing something undemocratic. I am just not ready to judge to conclusion especially since the countries calling them out on it are as you say yourself calling them out for switching to the same system as they have. The lowering the retirement age was the only sketchy thing they did in my eyes. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; I am not being salty, I neither dislike Poland or think that polish success will equate to less success to go around for the other member countries. It's the blind nationalism, the overstated sense that it is possible for a society to be successful without a lot of outside interference (good or bad) that bothers and undermines the union.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes that might be true that nationalism is true and you would be right were it other country. Poland is by far one of the most pro EU countries. They are not using nationalism to rile people up against eu and if they are it is not working at all. The only anti EU sentiment was tied to NS2 but that is understandable, beyond that you cannot compare it to the nationalism that is rife in Italy, UK or France. So far they succeeded imho because they understand they need to be part of the system, but if they were not part of EU they would still integrate themselves into the market in some capacity because it is the only thing to do, and except Hungary, everyone in east EU is putting pragmatism before nationalism.

The number of rapes reported increased by 10 percent in 2017, compared with the year before. It shows new figures from the Crime Prevention Council (Brå).

&gt;The report also finds that reported sexual offenses increased by 3 percent compared with 2016. In total, 11,000 such notifications are reported in 2017.

&gt;In the case of rape violations, a total of 7,370 notifications were made 2017, an increase of 10 percent compared with the year before.

Why would Brå record figures of reported rape if it was not of value?

You realise that if an attacker cannot be identified then they cannot be convicted? This is especially common in situations where the rapist was unknown to the victim.

The information from Brå above also flies in the face of your absued ""rape is going down therefore everything is fine"" logic.

4379,"The necessity is already there; economical and social indicators already point out the need of reforming immigration policies. 

Politicians (more than current Governments) need to not be scared of admitting the problems in Europe with imigrarion in fear of losing votes from the left. There needs to be a clear message stating that reforming immigration policies does not mean that Europeans want no inmigration at all. It means they want it under control and with clear goals. There should be no more left, no more right, and definately no more extremes what so ever. There should be a common, european, social consciousness that will drive the changes requiered to prosper as a union of nations; to stand together, accept our differences and thrive in them (instead of the opposite). You see this consciousness already, sprouting slowly but steadely in Europe specialy (as must be) in its youth. It will get there, eventually, and I hope sooner rather than later. 

The only way to bring this about, to go to the point, is to have politicians that offer us a realistic action plan about immigration, and to vote for them. 

I'm from Spain (and in this case Populism is threatening from the left, so perhaps my view is not that of northern European country). You must've heard about the Catalan issue. I'm out of the loop now, but when that happened, a new political party came to rise by opposing to it and saying what no other party dared to say for fear of losing votes. Ciudadanos (party in question) has since been polled as the 1st political party (vote intentions) many times since then, and they came to rise for saying something politically incorrect but that many, many Spaniards agreed with. 

I guess my point is; we need politicians with this common, european, social consciousness to serve the European citizens as best as they can and make Europe as welcome as can be without giving away our culture, values and customs, and accepting our differences instead of fearing them.

4439,"&gt; I’m simply stating that without overcharging the US, these companies would be losing billions of dollars a year in the present situation.

Yeah, but that doesn't translate to other countries having inflated prices.

Just because those companies go bust, or restructure, doesn't mean that the current way they operate is the only way.

It's similar to your car sales. If you claim that the US is financing car sales because you have a car sales monopoly that operates as a mafia-like middle-man it's a joke.

The US government, and US universities, contribute the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of new healthcare treatments, new drugs, and new ways to improve healthcare. I believe the private companies you are talking about are in the single digit percentages when it comes to that representation.

The same is true all over Europe, Japan, Korea, Singapore ...

These companies don't have a goal of improving healthcare, drugs, or anything else. Their only goal is to maximize profit - sometimes the 2 align, but often they don't.

Goldman Sachs published a report recommending the big pharma in the US to pursue treatments, not cures, as it would hurt their bottom line.

&gt;It’s actually rather moot though as drug prices are under 10% of total US NHE, so it’s not really that important.

It's not just drugs though. It's medical equipment, staff training, and a ton of other stuff.

Those companies are far closer to leeching marketing agencies than actual healthcare companies.

&gt;What is important is the fact that we spend 2.7 trillion dollars on everything else, which is FAR too high. It’s almost as large as the GDP of France. It’s ridiculous.

Honestly ... blame your insurance.

You have a middle-man whose only job is to pass on the expenditure to the consumer. Healthcare is an inelastic market, so the only alternative option is to die or suffer - when your premium goes up by 25% over 5 years ... then you pay it and accept wage stagnation.

When your coverage is reduced, then you accept it, because there isn't anything you can do.

Their goal is profit, and when they help you out it costs them money.

If your pal at the hospital doesn't really care about the costs, and the pharma doesn't care, and you don't care ... then they all just pass on the cost to the consumer.

Admin, insane wages, and insurance middle-men, are probably the vast vast majority of the reason.",,/r/europe/comments/99by06/eu_healthcare_expenditure_relative_to_population/e4ouxd8/,upvotesthenrages,1535029002

*A large group of people was surrounded in a hot and cramped underpass  leading out of the station, chanting “no camp, no camp”. Other  passengers clashed with police and forced their way back on to the train  to begin a standoff in the sweltering heat.

&gt;The Soviet Union never undertook a genocide on the same level as the Holocaust or the attempted eradication of Slavs.

It took on several.

&gt;Every individual genocide the USSR committed, like the Holodomor or the Polish Operation, was relatively tame compared to what the Nazis did.

This is sickening.

&gt;The Soviet numbers only might be worse because they committed a greater number of small-scale genocides against many different ethnicities.

So Nazis were worse because their one genocide was worse than the multitudes of Soviet genocides were individually?

&gt;You will have me reported for stating the simple fact that the Soviet Union didn't commit any crimes equal to the Holocaust?

This is a sickening disregard to the victims of Soviet atrocities.

""The recently created Slovak Republic joined the attack, and the Slovak Field Army Bernolák contributed over 50,000 soldiers in three divisions. As the main body of the Polish forces were engaged with the German armies farther north of the southern border, the Slovak invasion met only weak resistance and suffered minimal losses.

All Slovak units were pulled back until the end of September 1939. On October 5, a victorious military parade was held in Poprad. The mobilized units were gradually demobilized and the Army Group Bernolák was disbanded on October 7.

4559,"&gt; Yeah... that still doesn't explain it. For example Finland has the same issue of having to cover large geographical areas, and they manage to get better healthcare at a lower price.

Oh I didn't mean to say it explained all of it, merely that it would explain some of it.

Finland is far more concentrated that Sweden or Norway though. A huge amount of people live around Helsinki.

&gt;Or look at Norway, spends less as a percentage of GDP than Sweden, has the same geographical issues and the wages are even higher... yet their healthcare is better.

In 2013 Norway spent €5060/capita on healthcare. I'm sure that number has gone up by 2015 (which is where the Swedish numbers are from), so it's not that far off.

It's slightly less as a percentage of GDP, but it's not that far off. Same story goes with Denmark. All 3 are in the same realm of expenditure.

As for the quality of healthcare, I'm not sure. I haven't done much research into it. Perhaps you are right.

&gt;The real reason why Sweden's healthcare is terrible value of money is of course 1. incompetency and expensive bureaucracy and 2. massive numbers of refugees which drives up healthcare costs and/or lower quality.

I think every single nation says this though. You'll find the same comments in the US, UK, Singapore, Denmark, Norway, Germany ... It's everywhere.

Perhaps you are right and it is worse in Sweden than elsewhere. But Germany accepted a shit ton of immigrants too, as did Denmark, Holland, and most EU nations. Of course Sweden took in more, but I doubt it made *that* big a difference in 2015 (before the wave)

&gt;I have no idea why that would be relevant. Everyone in Norway earn an even higher wage yet they get better value for money.

I'll skip pointing out Israelis and Russians, honestly, it makes sense that they would criticize it anyways - I see no reason to really blame them for being vehemently against anyone who fought side by side with the regime that murdered millions of their family members - while I hope one day they can see the nuance, I am not holding it against them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The truth in this subject is really morally grey and complicated, but it's our history, and we need to be truthful about it. It comes with both sad understanding about facts - that these men were not ''Latvian freedom fighters'', but merely pawns in Hitlers game of global genocide, and that there were indeed thousands of Latvians who, directly or indirectly, forced or voluntarily, mass murdered both Latvian and foreign Jews without an ounce of remorse - and with understanding about the men themselves - that many of them felt like their ancestors in WW1 - fighting with one side, so that they could later turn on their current masters and once again gain a free Latvia. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd recommend reading ''Svina Garša''. It's haunting book on the Nazi and Soviet occupation of Latvia as seen by an ethnic-Latvian. One of the most humanizing tales of the period, since it allows much easier to break into the feeling of how it would feel to live in that period.

Nope. While some did, a large part of them were mobilized. Hell, that's why all of these foreign units were SS and not Wehrmacht - the SS was seen as an political organization and not an armed unit, so it could loophope through the conventions forbidding to recruit occupied nation citizens.

And not denying that what they did was wrong (from a certain point of view, of course). Really, nobody in Latvia, apart from ultra-nationalists support them having to fight for the Nazis. But that does not mean that our state is suddenly forbidden to forget about our soldiers and not remember them. Living in a democracy, the veterans have their right to organize an event for remembrance, just as much as Soviet veterans do. 

You see, it's much more in-depth then just ""they fought for the SS so they are automatically bad."" Scroll a bit downward and you'll see my fellow countryman explain perfectly who were the main bad guys in our units. That the legion indeed was a frontline unit, that did have a large role in our history, like it or not. Many of it's soldiers who remained on Latvian soil formed up into partisan units fighting now for a free Latvia (which was a motivation for some of the volunteers of the legion, to repeat the success of 1919, where a Latvian Army, rooted as an rifleman core in the Tsarist Army made the core that drove the occupying parties out of our land), and the ones who surrendered to Allied forces in Germany would also end up forming exile societies and helping our culture survive, so to say. A good chunk of these soldiers (as well as Estonian Legion troops) would end up as guards for the Nuremberg trials, as well as help in the Berlin airlift and guard American HQ's in Germany. 

The catch is in the depth of the event, and not the outer details. Not to say there were no bad guys in the legion, hell, the core was based around bad guys who committed atrocities and guarded ghettos, but they are getting the justice they deserve, or are getting it.",Long live the Republic of China,/r/europe/comments/99k3rt/on_this_day_79_years_ago_the_ribbentropmolotov/e4om8xh/,RifleSoldier,1535014947

4739,"&gt;I've yet to meet someone who thought there was no problems with immigration. There is a middleground between wanting to build a wall and allowing anyone in.

Yeah, I am as left as it comes, and I am in favor of immigration. But that doesn't mean I think everything is rosy. It comes at a cost. Immigrants are usually poorer and tend to be more represented in crime statistics. They also need to ~~immigrate~~ integrate as well as possible. 

That being said, I just think this isn't as simple as saying ""immigrants bad"" or ""immigrants good"". I think being harsh on immigration comes at a cost of having a country that is less free.

4779,"Hi Balorat

&gt; But this ""problem"" will only appear if the governments of Hungary, Poland, Romania, ... get stupid and voluntarily invoke Article 50, which is what got the UK in that shit show they are in right now.

That's right. But any country can 'get stupid' and invoke article 50. Look at the governments in these countries just now. Are they acting 'smart'?

An open question to every person: think about all the politicians and political parties in your own country. 

Are you certain that there aren't any populists who might invoke article 50 - perhaps during an economic or political crisis - at any time during the rest of your life? Blaming the EU instead of themselves, and leaving you stuck without an exit plan? 

I'm British. I would never have believed we would end up here - Brexit, then A50, almost 2 years in, no plan, nothing, just everyone's future fucked up.  I also was sure Trump would lose.

What I learned is that people will vote for the most utter nonsense and any country can fuck itself up very quickly indeed. Look at Venezuela. Look at the US. Look at Britain. Look at the last 100 years of history in Europe, particularly places like Spain, Germany, Italy, Eastern Europe, ... 

As long as your rights are provided by the state, and not as individual rights as a citizen of the EU, you cannot depend on them always being there. Your state can, and may, strip you of your freedom to escape at any time. That's why it is best if your rights are established as *yours*, and not your country's. 

Hopefully no country will ever again be as stupid as Britain has been, but I wouldn't count on it.

Cohen may or may not be an issue time will tell but Cohen was the lawyer whose job it was to figure out the correct/legal way of doing things and Trump was the client so pinning anything on Trump would involve jumping thru some hoops at best.  By the way, if Trump paid somebody hush money that is perfectly legal he and many other celebrities have done it many times and in case you have not heard yet, sex between two consenting adults is also legal.  

The catch would be if it was campaign donations and then what he did or did not know about it since Trump did not directly pay it.  Since Cohen has been soliciting Gofundme donations for himself any accusations that Cohen makes from this point going forward would be tainted anyways since Cohen is treating this as a money making process.  Even if they do come up with something solid they would need to wait until Trump is out of office to proceed regardless and the next president dem or republican would likely pardon him.

4830,"Actually, it was a violent overthrowing of the government because the ruling party leaders where kidnapped and taken into Moscow. The president, the political elite, the party representative, and the communist party itself declared the occupation illegal and refused to accept the Soviet demands. When the Czechoslovak apparatus did not cave in under the might of the army, it was demoted and replaced with pro-Moscow politicians in the period of the 9 months. But during the August days, all official Czechoslovak organization and state agencies declared the invasion as an occupation. Communists throughout the 1968 were in strict control over the country.    

There was a no way that Czechoslovak communists, even the liberals would be willing to cede their power even without the invasion. This was something, what both liberal and conservative communists were afraid of. The most likely outcome would be power-sharing with other similarly minded leftist parties and splinter groups. Right-wing parties in desperately leftist nations like Czechs and Slovakia had no chance . The rise of the right oriented population happened due Soviet Invasion where many people developed utter dislike toward Soviet block and anything that was related to Russia. Prior 1968 there was not anti-Soviet or anti-Russian feelings as the population lacked the experience with the brutality of the Moscow leaders. Czechoslovak communism between 1945-1968 was generally own grown, unlike in Poland and Hungary. Czechoslovakia did not even had Soviet bases there and many people wanted communism, their own version, not the Soviet one, because not many people had even traveled to USSR to witness the reality of it.",,/r/europe/comments/98vp1c/on_this_day_50_years_ago_the_warsaw_pact_troops/e4oe8hn/,kaik1914,1535000621

4873,"&gt;That was a lot of text to essentially make the same redundant arguments that everyone else has been making. I'm not going to write you an essay, so I'll try to make my response short and sweet.

No, I assume you skimmed it without giving it much thought, because I did address certain things you mentioned, for instance:

&gt;(3)...that a car/animal cannot consent...It's a legitimate argument that you have not rebutted...
 
&gt;And before you say ""but a car cant consent"", **that's only a problem because the way it is defined**

 The way marriage is defined requires both parties to show consent, does it not? If you believe that the man and car relationship can not be marriage because it fails to meet this requirement than surely you agree that a gay relationship can not be marriage because it does not meet the requirement of being man-women. Which kind of answers (5) but I will address that separately later. 

But you might argue that those requirements are unfair to gay people, how is it any less fair to the carsexuals? 

Recall you said:

&gt;I never said you could marry anyone. . . I said you can marry someone you love

and my response, 

&gt;But you can love anyone, or even anything as I added, 

and 

&gt;by your logic any definition of marriage would be discriminatory because there would always be people who form relationships outside of what is defined as marriage. Lets say you do extend the definition to include same sex couples, what about human car couples (seriously), and then some people fall in love with animals? You would have to infinatly keep broadening the definition ever time some people decide to get romantic with anything that isn't already included in the current definition.

So now, would you be in favor of redefining marriage to include man and car? We can come of with a proper definition that does not ""discriminate"" against their relationship. For instance, 

&gt; A relationship between man, or woman, and there car in which the man consents to ownership for x amount of years the car will be kept in good condition. 

Or we could always change the definition of consent in such a way that allows the car to consent. Such as if it is in in good condition the car is consenting. Or we could get rid of the consent requirement for the car all together. Either way the definition of marriage can to allow this marriage.

I will respond to the rest later, please wait before responding.

Also, none of the European nations you've mentioned aren't even close to being 75% *x ethnic group.* Singapore specifically works to protect the culture and customs of its minority ethnic groups, creating a medley of its component cultures rather than forcing them to all abide under one supreme culture. English serves as the lingua franca of the groups, while rather than promoting Mandarin supremacy, the government supports the propagation and education of its citizens is Malay and Tamil. In fact, it's a required ""mother tongue"" depending on which ethnic group you're in (which actually was a problem because a lot of the Chinese Singaporeans weren't from Mandarin speaking families. A significant number of Chinese Singaporeans are also Wu speakers, which is again, another hurdle they have to face under a government that only promotes Mandarin.) 

Also, you got any proof on that second claim? Singapore tightened restrictions on immigration following expulsion from Malaysia, but they relaxed that in the 80s. And while there might appear to be on the surface a huge Chinese supermajority in Singapore, the reality is that it's probably not as large due to the large number of non-Chinese non-residents. Additionally, the Chinese population across the years has reduced as a percentage of the whole, from 77% to 74% over the last 40 years; not a whole lot, but it's been a gradual reduction.

Capitalism is inherently unfair, oppressive and exploitative.

Based on that logic we are back at square one of every murder being equally evil, implying that liberalism, socialism and fascism are all equally evil, a conclusion you already rejected.

Of course industrialized mass murder is worse.

&gt; What the heck do you mean on a smaller scale? The Soviets killed more people!

*Maybe* in absolute numbers spread over a greater territory in a larger timeframe.

The Soviet Union never undertook a genocide on the same level as the Holocaust or the attempted eradication of Slavs. Every individual genocide the USSR committed, like the Holodomor or the Polish Operation, was relatively tame compared to what the Nazis did. The Soviet numbers only might be worse because they committed a greater number of small-scale genocides against many different ethnicities.

&gt; What the actual fuck. I will have you reported for this.

You will have me reported for stating the simple fact that the Soviet Union didn't commit any crimes equal to the Holocaust?

5121,"&gt;I'm not talking about GOP politicians like Rubio and Bush I'm talking about conservative voters and propaganda outlets that reacted to Obama by embracing bitherism which opened the door to the worst conspiracist and racist garbage. They elected Trump after eight years of extremist propaganda from right wing media like fox, Trump couldn't have come out of nowhere - the racist reaction to Obama paved the way for him.

You ignore that a lot of people who voted for Obama did not vote for Clinton and some then went and voted for Trump. Also not all the Republican party or base was asking for Obama's birth certificate. Saying they were is just not true. 

&gt;So in other words call them racists and they'll prove you right by being racists? If I call them motherfuckers will they promptly go home and fuck their moms?

No, they will knee jerk and say ""fuck you"" and then either become racist or vote for a racist candidate out of spite. It is not OK or a good basis for politics, but it is what it is. If you insult people they will hardly be more enticed to join your cause, but will more likely spit you im the face and go against. After all, you insulted them. 

&gt;Your best defense of Trumpers is that they have no moral agency and can't make rational decisions: republicans were going to vote for whoever was the worst extremist in 2016 and that had fuck all to do with anything dems said.

I am not defending anyone. I am saying DNC's and Clinton's 2016 platform was bad, and the left's behavior during and after the election was less than ideal and I can see how they alienated a good chunk of the electorate. 

&gt;That comment is largely a list of bullshit far-right hysterical grievances that suggest you read breitbart and other garbage

It's funny, every time I bring the ""I think the American left should be less disrespectful and agressive so as to not alienate independents and moderates"" topic, somebody accusses me of being a nazi. It's almost as if you guys can't take constructive criticism without resorting to name-calling (which is precisely part of my point, thanks for proving it).

Have you noticed my tag in this sub? Any ideas what the ""USE"" thing might stand for? Hint: USA. Look up Euro-federalism. I am VERY VERY far away from being a fucking nazi. I invite you to read my comment history, and check for yourself. 

&gt;Dylann Roof's mass murder was inspired by a mainstream conservatives donor group (council of conservative citizens) which has hosted GOP politicians. The GOP backed Roy Moore who believes Jews shouldn't have equal rights with christians; the democrats stance on 'identity politics' and PC is necessary and factual.

Did you even read what my criticism of PC and identity politics is? Or just ignored it? I will reiterate: I am well aware of discrimination faced due to gender, race, sexuality, etc. My problem is not with pursuing equality. My problem is with the things the left does, the hipocrisy and rejection of basic democratic principles (like presumption of innocence). Read my comment above for examples.

&gt;Thanks for proving that you can't read; I said Trump's base with neo-nazis not that they are neo-nazis - you're too ignorant to unstand a plain text comment. Nazis in charlottesville terrorized the town's Jewish community: the GOP base reacted by defending the nazis and ignoring c-ville Jews.

In my mind, if you are with the neo-nazis, you are a neo-nazi. But thanks for insulting me again and further proving my point - again :)

Sorry but I can't read your link - the page freezes with the EU data protection thingy. Sorry if it is your proof the GOP base backed the nazis, honestly can't read it. Otherwise, would you care to give me your source for that claim?

&gt;No one should have to be 'won' over to the side of opposing neo-nazism, that's what normal people born after 1945 are supposed to do: it's a basic requirement of being a civilized human being in the modern world. And I don't want people who sided with neo-nazis rather than a Synagogue's congregation on my side: to hell with them.

Again, please show me how they supported the nazis. Other than that, yeah, I agree, fuck the nazis. You can not and should not argue with them. But then again, I think only a tiny minority of Trump's base is nazi, you seem to believe it is a majority. You would be royally fucked if they were a majority, and yet you are not...

Is he wrong? Do we not have an immigration problem? Is Merkel's re-election not counting on adressing the immigration crisis, and large Turkish population that has flooded into Germany? The many mosques that have been propped up with known links to radicalisation? 

And yet Germany... Is not even the one with immigration problems.. Its Greece, and Italy. Yet the EU does nothing to contribute aid, in fair disperssion of immigrants. 

Italy acts against human rights, and denies a ship to dock.. And the EU helps how? It does nothing.. Macron does another infamous PR stunt, accepting a single ship, and doing little in policy change.

&gt; I like his push to get Europe to spend on defence, but I disliked how he did it.

It worked. Obama (One of my favorite American presidents tbh, if I was american), babying Europe, did nothing. So yes his foreign policy was weak. I would like him if I was American however, for domestic policy.

&gt; I HATE that he pulled out the Paris agreement, the planet has finite resources, America first in this regard does all future humans a disservice.

I agree Completely.. This is DISGUSTING. Again, never was a fan of trump in general. Just happy he is putting the EU leadership in its place, and calling it to be more than just puppets. But i can not excuse the climate pullout. (although irony will have it, that this simple act, made the entire world, more knowledgable about climate change and the pushback will be huge. Better than ever in history). Again, like I said, weak domestically, strong impact in foreign policy. In fact some cities in the USA far exceed the Paris agreement, in change. Remember the USA is an emulgation of states.. And most have challenged this pull out, and are keeping to it and exceeding it through their own mayors.

&gt; I like him getting tough with north korea

I personally did not like the threats and escalation of possible Nuclear war. I think the whole thing was a big show, for both Trump and Kim, to show off strength. I guess this little sideshow in the end, may have helped both. But again, I am not sure, if he was being overly clumsy, or if it was planned all along. The net result however, in my eyes, is a positive one when looking back.

&gt; I like that he questioned the free market agenda ( I like competive advantage in the long term but I dislike multinational supply chains fucking over local workers at the rate they are)

I believe in free Markets.. But only across countries, that should get stronger. Aka they have their priorities straight in human rights. Sanctions should be used, more often, for countries that think they can do as they please. Sanctions on Turkey and Iran is good. The EU sanctions were more of a faux threat, in order to get America closer to European markets. Essentially he wanted free trade also within the EU. The world sanctions against various economies, were to stick it to Chinas thriving tech industry challenging American and make deals with the rest.

&gt; I generally find his style distasteful, his hyperbolic lying patronising and his ego unbearable. Despite this, he sometimes does good things. Americans already don't like his style, Europeans find it even more unbearable, that would explain 15% to 50% of the bad press trump gets in Europe.

I was the biggest crittic of trump. Americans I think hate him more. His domestic policy is a shambles. But frankly his foreign policy is good for the EU.

There is no bigger exploiter of EU countries right now, than the people who control the EU. Some benefit at the expense of others. Namely Germany, France.

Spain Italy, Greece, have been big losers in the EU as it stands. So Trump is opportunistic... And he is trying to exploit weakness.

So why do I like him doing so? Because he forces the EU to fucking wake up, and fix their internal problems. Otherwise Trump will rip the EU appart. It pushes the EU AWAY, from being compacent and statically fucking over its member states.

Trump creates a force, that will do one of two things to Europpe:

1) Break Europe apart, and people focus again on their own interests.

2) Bring Europe TOGETHER... So we can be powerfull and sort ourselves out for the interest of all.

So I do NOT believe there is middle ground. The EU must either pull more apart, or get closer together. The time, of being 'fake' allies is over. EU must learn to go after the common good. In my eyes, it should come closer together as a Republic of sorts, and follow good economic game theory, where the benefits of all, are superior to the benefits of the FEW, or should I say 'surprlus countries'.

5199,"&gt;Amazing how you assumed I was a Democrat or something. You were talking about ""us"" like ""us"" is a thing... I'm not a part of any ""us"" as far as I know. I'm not even American. 

OK, fair enough, I did assume you were American. Apologies, you know how they are 99% of people in this site, and most Europeans in this sub have a country flair...

&gt;Your whole post was arguing how the Democrats ain't so hot either, but you're arguing against a straw man to begin with, because I never claimed they were pure political beings and a party without faults. However, having faults is not the same thing at all compared to the insanity that is Trump and the Republicans right now. This man goes contrary to pretty much all the values they claim to hold dear. Let's not forget a large part of the Republican base are fundamentalist Christians that preach about morals every chance they get, yet they gloss over the fact that if any modern politician would be The Antichrist, it would probably be the Orange Man himself, and I don't think I have to enumerate the reasons to why that is, right? The Democrats have never, at least in recent history, supported a candidate as hypocritical and insane as the Republicans have. While many Democrat leaders are a total letdown and are obviously not very good politicians, none of 'em ever came close to the level of insanity that Trump displays on a weekly basis. Any rational human being should and would choose them over this insanity. 

I did not say that the Democrats are AS BAD as the Republicans. I know very well who I would be voting for if I were American, even if very reluctantly (positions on healthcare and education, their foreign policy of bombing everything, problems with their identity politics, etc.). But I know that the Republicans have a lot of crazy going for them.

My post(s) were more along the lines of: the Democrats are alienating the independents and Republican moderates who would otherwise look at Trump and be like ""holy fuck"" and vote Dem. Insulting and name-calling Trump's base just drives them farther into Trump-land, instead of pulling them over the aisle (like Obama managed to do with some). And many of the shittiness the GOP displayed with Obama is now back for Trump (except for the whole racism angle). I was not arguing for both being as bad. Neither are good, in my opinion, but one is better than the other. 

So yeah, I know the Republicans are generally shit. It just makes me angry how the left insults and drives people away with these things, instead of keeping calm and being reasonable (as hard as it might be).

Most (almost all) imported cars come from Canada and Mexico. If the US completely banned the importation of European built cars it would make no difference because so few motorists drive European cars. It wouldn't push up overall automobile demand high enough to make a real difference.

 

Also, BMW prices wouldn't all go up because BMW builds lots of cars in the US which wouldn't be affected by the tariff.

[This article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/30/50-per-cent-surge-scottish-patients-sent-rest-uk-specialist/) states that 625 patients were sent to other parts of the UK for specialist treatment in 2016/17. While it's not a negligible number, it's certainly small enough to consider the Scottish NHS its own separate entity (considering there were [1.65 million A&amp;E visits](http://www.ournhsscotland.com/65-years/65-facts/current-facts) alone in 2012/13).

You make a good point about the Scottish NHS possibly benefiting from drug prices in the UK, but unless their drug orders are ordered with those of the English NHS (which I assume they *don't* do, but would be interesting to find out) I don't see how they would benefit from economies of scale - which is the point OP is making about Ireland.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/99by06/eu_healthcare_expenditure_relative_to_population/e4nlmx2/,AidanSmeaton,1534971892

I live &amp; work there and have multiple friends (early 20’s/late teens) who speak Irish fluently,  even to each other and as first language at home. I love hearing it, sometimes they forget I’m not from the Gealteacht and speak Irish to me.

Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the rest of Ireland. Growing up in a different city nobody ever spoke a word and we all resented the language because it’s required to be taught in school &amp; was rather difficult to learn. I would really advocate for people going to a gealteacht and engaging with the language first hand, really changed my attitude.

I think Irish is an amazing part of our culture

EDIT: I forgot to mention the thing I find coolest about hearing Irish is that native speakers talk with the exact same rhyme, rhythm &amp; accent that they have in English.

The little idiosyncrasies almost always change when people speak foreign languages like Spanish or Italian so I can always spot it.

We,as their offsprings,wont be the barbaric tribes that burned down Rome out of spite.Google if you have to.

To be fair, everyone did that back then. Art preservation is historically a new thing, taking art as booty is infact a time honored tradition that goes back to the bronze age, if not even earlier.

So you can't really blame people like Napoleon for taking art as spoils of war, when his actions were merely a product of his time.

While it shouldn't be excused today, back then it wasn't out of the ordinary and may have inadvertently saved some art that may have otherwise been destroyed elsewhere (which isn't a completely unfoundeed assumption in some cases, like the Assyrian artifacts taken from Iraq I mentioned, that have been destroyed in their home country).",Île-de-France,/r/europe/comments/99b6tq/greece_demands_britain_open_negotiations_over_the/e4n3iz0/,Anthemius_Augustus,1534957075

In many cases, it doesnt matter if you are a conscript, or a professional soldier who has been serving for years, your casualty rate will be very similar because it's not skills that really dictate how likely you are to get hurt (artillery rounds hurt everyone, barely trained conscripts and professionals alike).

5507,"&gt;I guarantee you that farmers are being hurt, badly.

They are not.

China put tariffs on American soy in June, and the whole world was talking about how the red states where the farmers are, were going to take a beating, as they wouldn't be able to sell their crop.

Fast forward to August - and the Chinese caved and bought some American soybeans (and paid the tariff to the Chinese govt):

https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-soybeans/vessel-carrying-us-soybean-cargo-empties-cargo-at-chinese-port-shipping-data-idUSL4N1V71PU

That's because there are only two places in the world that produce enough soy for export: the USA and Brazil, and they're not really competitors because one is in the northern hemisphere and the other in the southern, which mean their harvests happen at different times.

The Brazil harvest happened in spring, they sold their crop (at a premium) to the Chinese. If the Chinese need more soy (and they do) they have to buy from the Americans who are now havesting.

So all the Chinese did was make things more expensive for themselves.

Then factor in that the heatwave has reduced the size of the European crop in wheat, barley and rye by about 20% and the Chinese are even more dependent on the Americans.

Bottom line: the Americans don't actually need what the Chinese produce, especially as there are lots of other countries in the world able to produce the same stuff and sell to the Americans. But the Chinese need American food because they've trashed their own land and as a result of deforestation and other ills, the Gobi desert is expanding.",,/r/europe/comments/998l9u/trump_we_are_going_to_put_a_25_tariff_on_every/e4muhyy/,teatree,1534949667

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking in terms of the direct impact. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; As I explained: they are terrified of being  invaded by the US. Not threatening them with economic/military warfare  is a great way to take away the need for a bomb. You should understand  they aren't cartoon villains.

&amp;#x200B;

If the US wanted to, they could invade them tomorrow and the Iranian military would be a smouldering ash heap within 48 hours. If they don't understand that it is not in their rational interest to develop nukes, then it is firstly our failure to not drive home the point that developing nukes is a suicidal proposition in itself, because you're at risk of military action. Secondly, it is Iran's problem that it cannot recognize that developing nukes could very well be the thing that leads to their destruction.

&amp;#x200B;

What you refer to is the bigotry of low expectations, that these 'uncultured people' can't see what is in their best interest so we have to walk on eggshells around them.

&amp;#x200B;

No, the Japanese knew the impact of attacking Pearl Harbor and the Iranians have enough sense to know the risks of a nuclear program. We don't need to be soft on them to get them to understand reality.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But they did work. *That's the freaking point*.  That's why we got the nuclear deal which is a basis for a non-nuclear  middle east. If Iran started to redevelop nukes after the 15 year period  than it would have been an excuse to drop the deal and resanction. But  if they don't, relations normalize.

&amp;#x200B;

But they're not acting in a way which makes sense according to your worldview. They have PUT THAT MONEY INTO THEIR MILITARY. That indicates that they are just using the lifting of sanctions to buy time. The sunset clause is just that. A way to buy time for them.

&amp;#x200B;

If they had indicated a willingness to engage with the international community, I might agree with you. But they didn't. They have already blown any good will they might have generated.

&amp;#x200B;

Your next comment is just an example of a classic fallacy. You talked to some Iranians with no power, so you know something about Iran. Get real.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Are you refering to the Iraq-Iran war? The  one where Saddam invaded Iran resulting in the deaths of hundreds of  thousands? Mate, you've got to have some kind of extreme bias to keep up  this level of cognitive dissonance.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care who started it, I care that it started. I don't want Iran to be in a situation where Saudi Arabia and its allies attack Iran and its allies or the reverse. I don't care who committed the original sin. Right now Iran is in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. That's all the proof I need of their hostile intent.

5541,"So here comes the problem of people not being able to trust their media.

In every country, even one like Sweden, there's always a segment of the population who won't trust what they're told because of... whatever reason.  That segment may be small - 5-10%, or it may be large (I imagine over 25% in the US).

This distrust rises and is triggered when the media tells these people - who are likely close to a political extreme, whose side has been losing politically - things that they don't want to believe.  So if you tell Americans that immigration is good for their country, conservative Americans are more likely to distrust that because they don't want to believe it.

5543,"&gt;Trump literally spearheaded the birth certificate movement against Obama. You can argue all you want but that shit had so many racist undertones they lit up like a Christmas tree to anyone not blind to see. Half of Republicans went absolutely insane facing the fact that they are now lead by a black man. It's that simple. You think the media is unfair to Trump and Republicans? Mate... Fox News criticized Obama for the spices he chose to use on his sandwiches. Alex Jones, which is a popular figure of the right, and is lauded by Trump and has promised him ""not to let him down"", has literally claimed that Obama and Clinton are DEMONS, and that they smell of sulfur.

So ""Jones + Trump = GOP""? You are aware Trump had to win the establishment cadidates Bush, Rubio, etc. in the primaries, right? Either you claim they are as bad as Trump, or you need to back down from the ""all the Republicans are like Jones and Trump"" idea. 

&gt;Obama really did make an effort to work with the Republicans even so, but all they ever did was try to kill any initiative Obama had and now all they do is try and reverse all his legacy.

Well, is that the fault of the Republicans being racists, or of the toxically partisan politics you have in the USA? Are the Democrats trying to compromise with the GOP on agreeable issues right now? They might be, in which case I missed that memo. I did not miss the memo about the New York AG race, for example, in which the main candidates all want to prosecute and jail Trump as their campaign pledges (they want to ""lock him up"", if you will... sound familiar?). So please don't act as if the Democrats do not do the same shit in this respect. 

&gt;And Obama wasn't even 10% as adversial towards Republicans as Trump is now towards Democrats, calling them traitors every other day.

I seem to recall the Democrats are also calling Trump a traitor? Also, as I said above, the Democrats are being as collaborative with Trump as the Republicans were with Obama. And before you say ""lol you expect us to support Trump's racism"", no I don't. I am sure you can find common ground with the GOP on something, and if you can't you should at least try. 

&gt;But Democrats are still expected to play nice and be respectful and not call out the Republicans for their insanity, I wonder what's expected of Republicans though? It seems like not literally flinging shit towards their opposition is enough to make them worthy of being understood and respected.

Well, you know, I am a leftist, so of course I fucking expect ""my side"" to be better than the other side. I am well aware Trump has enabled a wave of craziness into American politics. My argument is that Trump being president is caused in a good part by the DNC's Clinton's and the left's inability to offer possitive solutions to those who did not already support them: the poor white classes of America who do not care about PC or LGBT+ but do care pretty much about their shitty economic prospects and their children dying of heroin. You guys do whatever you feel like, I am just saying youbare partially causing the problem instead of solving it. Shouting ""racist!"" does not convince anyone, explaining that the fault for their problems is not the Mexicans but the wealthy and the corporations running with the money, might convince people. 

&gt;But yea, you're right, it is no wonder that Trump won, it's just that you're very wrongly blaming the left for that, instead of blaming the actual cause, which is the extensive brainwashing and propaganda of the right wing media which literally created an alternate reality where facts don't matter and the Democrats are evil, baby killing traitors, demons and pedophiles, that want to genocide white people. 

I am partially blaming the left, yes. Is that hard to understand? Does that have anything to do with Fox News and their bullshit? Also, are Democrats pure political beings, who look for nuance and different perspectives instead of retreating to their echo chambers? Or do they also fall prey to the confiness of no one of their circle challenging their opinions, so they can calmly prejudice themselves against ""the others""?

&gt;At least when the left calls the Republicans racist, it's cause many of them are legitimately fucking racist and Trump himself is obviously so. I mean the guy literally had to settle in court because he refused to lease his properties to black people back in the day. What more do you need? There's a reason why pretty much every neo-nazi and alt-righter is voting for Trump, and it ain't for his fucking economic policies.

Trump =/= GOP =/= the GOP bases =/= the right =/= the nazis 

I have at no point said Trump is not racist. But you jump to conclusions instead of actually reading what I said. Maybe try to see there is nuance is some of these things?","Spain, USE ",/r/europe/comments/998l9u/trump_we_are_going_to_put_a_25_tariff_on_every/e4muqjj/,NombreGracioso,1534949874

I have a group of close friends in Romania and two of them are gypsies. Nobody looks at them any different because of their ethnicity. They are civilized and I never seen a sign of rasism in any interaction they had. They are engineers and have the same life like anybody else in the group.

Maybe my experience is limited but every gypsy that I met who acted civilized didn't complain about discrimination it show signs of it. 

On the other hand the are villages in Romania were because of rrom groups, even the police can't go inside, there are a lot of rroms who simply prefer that life of steeling and begging on the streets instead of being productive in society.

5644,"Oh shit, man, sorry, I had no idea. I thought you were merely  misinformed, you should have said that you were a fanboy, I honnestly wouldn't have even bothered. Now, where do I start ?

Since, you seem to have chosen the (arguably easier) path of not reading the article I linked, allow me to quote for you a part relevant to your rebuttal :

*demonstrated how the corporation repeatedly ignored experts’ warnings, sought favorable scientific analyses and helped to “ghostwrite” research that encouraged continued usage*

Now, you say 
&gt;The question of science shouldn't be made based on a few snippets from an ominous sounding emails, rather based on research.

and I definitely agree. But qualifying those documents of ""a few snippets from an ominous sounding emails"" is rather disingeneous. This is Monsanto's internal communications, not idle talk by the coffee machine. Again, read the quote : they knew, chose to ignore studies that showed link between usage and cancer risk, and published baloney studies to keep selling their shit. I hope they used glyphosate before sowing their disinformation (and used bullshit as a fertiliser, obviously.)

As for the ""public image of Monsanto"", I think you're projecting a bit there bud. I don't give a rat's ass about them (or their image). The way I see it, they could die instantly or live on forever, IDGAF. A business primary responsibility is to make money, I mean, duh ! If they manage to sell gold painted crap at the price of gold good for them. Now, *if* said gold painted crap causes their customers harm, I believe it is their duty to repeal their product and actually do some work, searching for a better alternative so they can sell that instead. When they choose to go the let's cover our shit through disinformation and doctoring scientific studies-way, I start to give a shit.

Oh, hey, by the way, that comprehensive study of yours, and the campaign for accuracy in public health research ? Partially paid for by the EU Commission ? Was it published before or after [Monsanto had their entry into the parliament revoked](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/28/monsanto-banned-from-european-parliament)

Now, one last thing. You're a bit of a dick. It's quite unpleasant. 
&gt;I think you are a perfect demonstration of what I mean

Wait a sec', are you calling me a yahoo ? A thinly veiled insult, but an insult nonetheless
&gt; those documents didn't give the guy cancer.

Dangnabbit, I believe you did ! Twice. I hate it when condenscending people assume that because I disagree with them I must be some kind of halfwit to be insulted in order to make their own argument shine. I maybe should insult you back a bit, you know, not to be a dick, or to demean you, but to even the score a little. More like brotherly ribbing. Okay, here it goes then :

If gullibility was matter, your head would be a black hole, which you'd have to unstick your tongue from Monsanto's ass to notice. Yeah, I know, I'm not great at ""thinly veiled"", I'm more of a mildly comedic type of dude.

I almost forgot !! &gt; We need food. Glyphosate is one of our best herbicides and over and over again showed to be safer than its alternatives. If you stop using it, what will you use instead?

Seriously ? Scare tactics ? Like, ""if I don't want to starve I better start praising Monsanto, *or else*... (I swear dude, it sorta reads like that.) I dunno man, maybe we should start, I don't know, maybe not gorge ourselves ?

5690,"\&gt;   And is there something you can do to bring down the numbers?

Yes, don't just let everyone into your country, especially people who differ drastically from your own on essentially every aspect, especially when it comes to values and views on things. Sweden is one of the least religious places in the world, so bringing relatively extreme religious fundamentalists to a country like that probably isn't the greatest thing to do.

​

There is an entire world where you could receive immigrants from, and economic statistics has proven that immigrants from Africa and the middle east are the worst immigrants for your country economically, and it is also becoming quite clear that they're also the worst on a social basis, as they create disjointed parallel societies more often than any other immigrant group. So simply be more selective about who you let in, and instead immigrate more people from the rest of the world. Europe, North America, South America and Asia. There are plenty to pick from.

5700,"From sweden and I am really divided by this topic.
My girlfriend have problem with cysts on her ovaries and those hurt as hell.
So we go to the emergency because something is really fucked up.

All the medical staff super rude. We come for help and all have the feeling we just disturbed them with our minor inconvenience. After 40 min she finally sees a doctor, he does standard procedure then want another doctor to take a look. So after 30 min waiting the other doctor says it's no point, he does not want to look. After argumenting for 10 min he finally agrees to get the gyn. The gyn is a bit worried so she does an ultrasound and later says ""you have a cyst and it have busted, its about 1 liter of leaked blood in your stomach"". But after that all the doctors did was to send her home without doing anymore and ""just take 500 mg paracetamol if it hurts"". After that my SO called around different clinics for a check up and no one want to see her. But its a problem that is recurring so she want to know what it is. After hitting the high payment protection of 1100 SEK she had enough. Sure the healthcare was free now. But that does not matter because its inefficient. So she calls a private clinic. Gets a guidance meeting just 2 days later. Once at the clinic they directly sees something is wrong and does a full check up. She have a look up in 2 weeks.

The public healthcare is so slow, so inefficient. Its not the staff fault, its a country problem that they are understaffed. But it can take months to see a doctor. And if the public healthcare is this bad i rather save my tax and pay more at a private clinic.

Its no mystery that Kry (app for video call doctor) is booming.

They case have been reported to the patient board and will be lifted to a higher instance. This is really bad for one of the best University hostpitals in Sweden.

5729,"&gt; Well, considering that the thesis is playing with numbers to justify the conclusion, I don't see any other way of replying. The protectionism is also not only tariffs, but other barriers (""quality"" and ""competence"" control for example), and measures like weight mean are rather pointless since some markets are closed not due to the tariffs, but due to other regulations (like you wouldn't buy Russian trains or cars due to ecological regulations or penalties, while the tariffs could be small)

Sure, but the article uses the OECD measure which is then questioned without offerring an alternative *nor* a point of comparison with other countries. So it's an option for further research, yes, but until they have done the work it's no more than that.

Anyway, on another note, the big opposition party (USR) has no platform other than anti-corruption and the leaders are still religious. They have no political program etc, so I can't vote for them, I'd other like to see religion gone from politics and they won't do that.

On top of that, whenever a country gets a new government that runs on anti-corruption, it's almost a sure fire bet that the new government will be more corrupt than the party they replaced.

5798,"&gt;In their article ‘Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States’ the authors state: ‘Clearly the extent to which the conservative white male effect on climate change denial exists outside the US is a topic deserving investigation.’ Following this recommendation, we report results from a study in Norway. McCright and Dunlap argue that climate change denial can be understood as an expression of protecting group identity and justifying a societal system that provides desired benefits. Our findings resemble those in the US study. A total of 63 per cent of conservative males in Norway do not believe in anthropogenic climate change, as opposed to 36 per cent among the rest of the population who deny climate change and global warming. Expanding on the US study, we investigate whether conservative males more often hold what we term xenosceptic views, and if that adds to the ‘cool dude-effect’.1 Multivariate logistic regression models reveal strong effects from a variable measuring **‘xenosceptic cool dudes’. Interpreting xenoscepticism as a rough proxy for right leaning views, climate change denial in Norway seems to merge with broader patterns of right-wing nationalism.**&gt;

5839,"&gt;Lmao Noel Malcolm
He's the most pro-Albanian writer you can find that's not actually Albanian.

Don't read Noel Malcolm then. You are welcome to read either Ducellier or even serbian sources like Vaso Cubrilovic,Radonic,   Vasiljevic  and Stojan Novaković . All  beat wikipedia but then again I have a feeling you will make some half assed excuse for them too, which I expect from someone who uses the word siptara like its normal.

&gt;I only said the Ottomans brought Albanians to Kosovo. Russians were present in East Estonia before the settlement as well, but in fewer number until the Soviets settled them. That was my point. Not that the whole Albanian population was settled there.

You really have to make up your mind. First you said that yes they were there and now you are saying they were brought with the Ottomans. The fact that the natural ethnic border for Serbian kingdoms has always been the mountains of Kosovo shows that there was an ethnic entity preventing them from moving. Add to that the fact that serbs themselves settled in Kosovo only in the 9-10th century and even then described meeting the Arbanas.

&gt;'escaped', right, that's not what ethnic cleansing is called mate.

Take it with the Ottomans. If the Ottomans had chased the Albanians/Vlachs instead and you had settled in the mountains you wouldn't have a problem with it. Something which actually happened  in the 19-20th century which you clearly have never had a problem with.

&gt;So yeah we lost to the Ottomans and Albanians took the land and settled it, that was the original point?

 You missed the points of :

&gt;We must add  that the Byzantine authors  are sensitive about the unity of the people  from Albania to Macedonia;  the historian,  Laonikos CHALKOKONDYLIS of the 15th century, after stressing that the Albanians are quite different  from the Serbs and the Bosnians [14], says that no other people resembles the Macedonians more than the Albanians [15].

&gt;In these conditions the Turkish occupation began in the second half of the 14th century, and it is true that at this juncture the Albanians affirmed themselves again in Kosovo, but, of course, not in the way the question is usually presented, as if the Albanians came on the Turkish band-wagon; on the contrary, from the Shkodra Lake up to Kosovo they bound together and resisted along with the other Christian peoples.

&gt;At the time of the celebrated battle of 1389, the Greek authors mention, apart from the Serbs and the Bulgarians, also, the Albanians of the North, those of Himara, Epirus and the coastal zone [16]. The Turkish chronicler Idrisi BITTISI, mentions the participation of the Albanians of the Shkodra region, whose prince, Gjergj BALSHA, led 5 000 men into the battle [17] ; the same data are provided by the other Ottoman chroniclers, Ali and Hoca SAADEDDIN [18].

__________________________________________________________________________________________


&gt;not naturally 

 Theres nothing natural about focusing on an event that happened 7 centuries ago for modern borders. Espetially considering this little paragraph :

&gt;Indeed, such an argument would never serve the advocates of the ""Serbian thesis"". The less so since most of the Slavonic toponyms in Kosovo and Albania appear to be more Bulgarian than Serbian, which is quite natural  because the Bulgarians had occupied the zone since the 9th century, and especially at the end of the 10th century, at the height of the last Bulgarian Empire, with Ohrid as its capital [9].

&gt;At that time the Serbs lived away from Kosovo; in fact, in the 9th-10th centuries their first compact colonies were Rascia (Raška) in the Ibar valley, west of Morava, and Zeta which corresponds broadly to present-day Montenegro.

&gt;It is precisely when prince Stefan NEMANJIĆ became King in 1217 that the Serbian state began to expand and include the zone of Peja (Peć), while the main body of Kosovo territories remained outside its borders.  It is unnecessary to dwell any longer on this since no ""historical"" argument can but refute the ""Serbian"" thesis, as history points out that the Serbs, in regard to Kosovo, are very late comers.

5854,"Here one of your countrymen, a Dutch and Polish speaker, living now in Poland for quite some years. What you're doing in this comment is just copy pasting statistics. You need to understand that this drop is a forecast. Nothing more. I would love it if you could show me an academic paper when Poland would hit a ceiling. INCLUDING the new migration wave. In Poland we do not see it happening soon. Many people are coming to Poland lately. Data on permanent foreign residences and in-dept maps of this movement into Poland you can find on this website: https://migracje.gov.pl/. This is a trend still building up. It looks like that with the rising salary, Poland will become a country where more and more people will migrate to. Especially from Ukraine and Belarus. The movement of Poles to Western Europe is part of a bigger movement of peoples moving from East to West. And why would people not move here, personally I love the culture and people. And I even like the overly complicated language (weird I know...). This country has a history of not being depreciated fully for what it is. The division of Poland at the end of the 18th century, WW2 and PRL (communist period) is a big trauma in this country. PiS is just a result of Polish people kicking back against the French-German power block within the EU. 
 I am not a big fan of PiS and the things they do to this country. I do understand though that a population wants to have control over their own destiny. We always wanted that in NL as well. It is not weird that Poland and Hungary are kicking back against the most prominent member states sometimes. NL has been a founding member and has slowly gone through the changes. Poland and Hungary just joined in 2004. The movement forward economically and politically since 1989 has not been anything less than incredible. A step back to a more conservative government does not mean this country is lost or a bad pupil. Maybe it is time for Western European countries to scratch their heads and think 'why do people vote like this?'. Poland is an ally and not an enemy. We let them in in 2004. It is the EU who chose to put expansion over integration. This has put the European project a while back, which is something obvious when economic differences are so vast.

You must understand that saying no instead of yes to refugees and economic immigrants would not have made a lot of difference. In the Baltic states they did say yes to refugees. Most of them left to Germany after being placed in the Baltic countries, a close example what would have happened if they would be placed in Poland. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-baltics-idUSKBN13N0RY. What should Poland have done? Exchange resources put towards development of the country, which is still highly needed for the coming years, towards refugees and then see them walk out of the country again? We can talk about being loyal and brotherly between nations and equally distribute refugees. Which is in my opinion fair as well; but from a technocratic standpoint, and not an emotional one, it would not have mattered and just been a waste of resources.

I have seen Warsaw change a lot the last few years. Skyscrapers being built and huge swats of the city being renewed. This is mostly not EU funded, but privately funded. Poland is a highly divided country with a big rural and very catholic population and a very metropolitan population with very progressive ideas living in the big cities. The GDP reflects this as well. Although the EU has done great stuff for this country; this country was already moving forward with great strides from the beginning of the 90's, after going through the economic shock of a transition from a centrally-planned economy to a market economy. You can check the huge growth of GDP here: https://tradingeconomics.com/poland/gdp-growth-annual. 

What needs to be done towards Poland is stop having a 'superior' approach. Poland is an equal, not an enemy or some kind of child who needs education. Understand why people there vote this way. Understand how the country is build up demographically. The EU needs to play on these people fears and disappointments and treat these people as equals. 

Last but not least, stop pulling the EU funds card. The EU decided already on the expansion from 2004 to 2007. This means that we first need to build up our former Eastern bloc and now friends before we can further integrate. See it as an opportunity though. A massive market is opening up in Central and Eastern Europe. In the end every crash politically and economically makes our beautiful continent stronger.
