Let’s make a deal: when I provide you links showing that TVP during PO or SLD government was much less biased - you will make a post on r/Poland in which you will state those links and you will state ”I am a rightwinger posing as a centrist but the level of GoebbelsTV propaganda is just crazy and I can’t remain quiet”.

Although I think that the risk of a significant deviation is probably  exaggerated. There are elements of UK law that are actually more stringent than the minimum EU requirements. Minimum wages for example are higher in the UK than large parts of the EU and there are huge disparities between different parts of the EU anyway - some states don't have one.

Would the EU deem it acceptable if as part of an agreement the UK demanded that all parts of the EU raise their wages to the UK level as a base minimum in order to ensure fair competition?

You have these things called computers, into those computers you put data. You need to programme those computers to take data and give analysts actions to undertake processes to unsure that things happen and decisions are made given national policy and this thing called 'the law'.

For data protection reasons not all government agencies have all data. People, especially non-citizens as guests, are expected to be able to support the government in this operation.

Currently, analysts are trying to ensure all foreigners (which this guy is due to his failure to get nationality) are processed correctly and have the correct status given available data. Where that data does not exist then support is required from the individual to process their case to ensure correct completion. 

This then needs to be done literally millions of times. You can't do each case on a one-by-one basis. If we did things like this then it opens the door to inefficiency and corruption, like the Italian government system.

](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/11/ofcom-to-be-given-role-of-policing-online-platforms)

The broadcast watchdog, Ofcom, is to be handed responsibility for policing online platforms under government plans to be unveiled this week, it is understood.
The government launched its proposals to regulate internet firms more tightly last April. It was believed Boris Johnson intended to forge ahead with the plans in some form after his general election win, though there was initially little detail on how they would work.
At the time, the government was forced to deny the plans would lead to a “North Korean-style censorship” regime, with critics concerned that a government regulator with power to block access to non-compliant platforms could find itself deciding which websites British internet users could visit.

Any goods sanctioning has been ironically enough placed by Putin. The EU sanctions on Russia consists of a blacklist of banks, companies, and businessmen tied to the Ukraine crisis and Putin's corruption, nothing more and nothing less.

These sanctions have actually worked quite well and have weakened Putin. They have been even more effective since they stacked with the oil crisis of 2014 which has put the economy in shambles. The point of the EU sanctions is not to make Russia backtrack on Crimea, but to make sure the mission got so expensive they will think twice before doing so again. Russia is a very diverse country and Putin is only in power because he has successfully been able to unite the Oblasts and Republics in support of federal control.

263,"&gt; bit it's the EU making all the empire moves and talk

The debate in UK, and not just in UK to be fair, on issue of EU is extremely simplistic. Due to how political spectrum is divided between Remain and Leave, both side see EU from their own scewed prism. Incorrectly.

The moves to imperialisation, so to speak, of EU have been going on for a while and are not nowhere near to stop - as Leave voters correctly observed - but this does not mean that it will be based on socjust values of liberal-left - as Remain and Leave sides both failed to notice.

You have to realize when looking at Eurobarometer polls that there is will among population to do ""more Europe"", but the disagreement is how to do it. The continental identity has been alread formed, by and large, and you can see this clearly on these 21st cent alt-light movements like ones of Sellner which abandoned the boomerist thesis that drove Leave and instead took the pan-continental approach and mixed it with conservative values of anti-migration, protection of heritage, culture and so on. Its what made them so successfull among the millenial groups which do not long for return of CW-era of nation states but neither to ""Sweden, YES!"" era that many of Remain envision as future.

The future of EU will not look neither how Remain, nor Leave envision it. The German-driven technocratic rule is collapsing and things like ""Refugees welcome"" are of the past, sad attempt that failed miserably.

382,"Again, your whole argument falls apart because you assume that productive capability is a trade off. The underlying assumption of that is that there's full use of resources, which most often is not the case.

And now you suddenly introduce GDP into the conversation just out of the blue as if that's the most relevant metric.

When you're taking people who weren't producing anything and were leeching subsidies out of the government and put them doing something how can you argue that's it's better to instead keep those people on unemployment and buy from outside the country?

You also don't seem to see the difference between paying lip service to free trade and actually practising it fully. No one does it for good reason. Nonetheless for obvious reasons it's good to pretend one does it.

Substituting import was stated government policy in Portugal, Spain and dozens of other countries until the 1980s. It's still a big driver of economic policy in most of the world.

386,"&gt; Maybe you can correct me, but I get the impression that relying too much on oil exports caused the Venezuelan crash.

Every oil producing nation (except for the US, which in large part caused the oil glut) took a hit when the price of oil dropped, but they didn't experience a crises. The fundamental reason why Venezuela turned out the way it did, without going into detail because as the person your replying to has said it could take forever, is because the the socialist regime created a standard of living over the last 20 years or so that was not at all consistent with Venezuela's level of economic development. 

Using oil revenue via government controlled schemes they imported a lot of basic commodities like toiletries, certain common foods, medical supplies, and even things like home appliances rather than allowing the economy to grow in complexity so those things could be supplied domestically like a normal country.

So when the government went broke unlike those other nations where locally harvested/produced goods prices will fluctuate along with the economy, they just disappeared because the Venezuelan currency was worthless and they could no longer be imported. Which not only sharply lowered the standard of living for the majority of citizens but also caused further strife to the economy because a lot of it was dependent on imports as well.",,/r/europe/comments/f4vw6v/map_whether_every_country_imports_more_from_china/fhwn2nr/,76DJ51A,1581921433

I'm always annoyed by people arguing that joining a military defensive agreement would be ""bad"" for Finland because it would provoke Russia.

Buddy, that us making ourselves harder to annex is offensive to them is a pretty big red flag about the situation already. And if anything, is an argument for doing exactly that, not against. Unless someone is planning to annex you, why should they care in the least how easy it is?

Nato is such a complex thing, I don't think most people (myself too) nor even politicians actually understand it.

The Ustashe were arguably the faction which stood by its ideology most firmly. Due to this fanaticism (and their bloody backlog of crimes) the Partisans were much more active in eradicating them rather than attempting incorporation.

The amnesties offered by the Partisans applied to the Domobranstvo (Croat and Slovene) and Chetniks, with the requirement 'that no blood was on their hands'/no crimes were committed. Ustashe and other collaborationist militia were not included in this amnesty:

521,"Because how much you import/export is not the only thing that matters. When you do it is when it matters.

Germany exports electricity during the times nobody is in a deficit majority of times, when their renewables can generate a surplus.

It imports electricity at times when electricity is scarce, putting extra pressure on everyone.

To use an example, say Germany exports electricity at 12:00 when nobody needs it, everyone has enough electricity for their own needs (both those who use renewables and those that don't, lets say it was a nice windy day). Electricity such as that is worthless. 

Then at 18:00 the sun is down, the wind has stopped blowing, and Germany needs to import electricity, due to 20-30-50% of it's industry was being powered by renewables. They have to import electricity but at the time, electricity is scarce, czech industry needs it too. Using electricity imported from czech non-renewable sources, puts additional strain on czech system, and such electricity is extremely valuable. Czechs can sell it for a nice price, even more than they can sell to their own citizens, it'd be preferable to flog it to germany.

If we let Poland into NATO Russia may be upset and relations will stay icy for years, they may act up in different regions, we’ll scare them by putting NATO right on their border without giving them a buffer, ect. The whole situation was very uncertain and Russia was very much an enigma. But the author made a point that has stuck out in my mind and whenever I read about the US or the west worried about Russian opinions I go back to it. 

His point is, the west owes nothing to the Russians period. The US owes nothing to the Russians. The Poles owe nothing to the Russians. The US and thus NATO shouldn’t jeopardize one former bloc citizen’s life to appease Russia. If the Russian feelings are hurt and they feel like their power is being taken as the US/NATO gain strength, it doesn’t matter. The west owes nothing to Russia.

614,"&gt; Last I checked, Americans don’t go to Europe to demand refuge in the thousands. They don’t go to Europe and leach off the state and demand welfare benefits either. Also, when Americans go to Europe they have valid passports so the state knows exactly who they are and where they come from. 

How do you know? Because they are Americans? Because Americans don't do those things?

&gt; On the other hand, your government doesn’t know who Mohammed from Syria is; whether he is a terrorist or not is unknown because they have no valid credentials.

Apart from being wrong on multiple accounts, you are still looking at an individual here and not a group of people.

&gt; And then when he gets there, chances are big he won’t even want to assimilate into western society either.

Says you.

&gt; Ok one more question, do you know the financial costs of taking in so many refugees?? Or are you completely clueless? It costs millions of dollars (or euros in your case) to feed and house these people. Since when did it become okay to start helping foreigners over helping your own citizens first?? 

You know it's actually possible to do both right? Are you some Trump supporter or anything? Crying about money when people are literally dying.

&gt; It’s already expensive as hell to live in many European countries (yellow vest protests prove the point), and the citizens there are struggling.

693,"&gt;The fact that Russians want something and consider it their interest doesn't mean they are going to get it. This narratve (Russians consider former USSR theit sphere of interest, we should give it to them) is absurd.

Of course not, but this is something that needs to be discussed frankly and a policy formed around it, but I don't see this happening. 

Instead, Russian interests are ignored, and when they act aggressively to secure them the response is shock, disbelief and hopes and prayers that everything will return to ""normal"" after Russia has been scolded enough. 

Putin is crazy, Putin wants to destroy democracy and instill his brand of autocracy, the Russians want to blitz seven days to Rhine, the Baltic states could be next etc. etc. There's a ton of bullshit narratives that obscure what actually happened and why it happened. 

It's haram to even ask the question what could have been done to avoid this. 

&gt;So Russians could have any national interest they want, but as long as it includes subduing other nations, they won't get it.

Yeah, but that's not true, they are gonna get it by force if they need to. When tanks rolled into Ukraine and Georgia, you stepped aside. The area of Ukraine that they now directly control is the size of Slovakia.

The West here is in a position of power, but the time of that power being unchallenged has passed. Instead of using that position of power to set the rules of the game and create a security framework everybody can live with, it is wasted on a wide front confrontation with Russia with no discernible end goal other than the fantasy of Russia getting back at the kid's table, and no road map of getting there. 

The key to longevity as the top dog is not to have challengers coming after you swinging balls to the wall. It is making the challengers content enough about their second or third place as not to make it an almost existential struggle, and managing the competition so that challenges get predicable and play to your strengths. 

This all requires some give and take.

I'm spitballing here, but would it be the worst thing ever if you have reached an agreement that Russia is not to touch Ukraine/Georgia, but that they won't be NATO members either? Hell, you're sure as hell not gonna let them in now, but nobody has the balls to actually say that.

But no, that kind of thinking would be heresy, even if it doesn't infringe on anybody's rights and is entirely non violent.

This better be a joke. Read a fucking history book. Htiler did not rise due to communists *at all*. Hitler rose to power because he exploited the worldwide economic downturn combined with the impact of WW1 reparation payments leaving many Germans destitute and bitter towards democracy.

&gt; The Anti-Semitism was popular well before the Nazis came to power. 

While true, it was Hitler and the NSDAP exploiting the thousands of years of historical antisemitism to the fullest and exterminate over 6 million Jews. For the NSDAP, Jews were a pretty easy scapegoat for their propaganda.

&gt; 
&gt; 

Or they could just pivot to other markets such as India and China.

&gt;Amazon is mostly for-pay and price-competitive though. I understand your point about them doing great despite not offering as good a service as they do in the US, but that service is still competitive.

My point about Amazon was that the service they offer in Europe isn't as good as what it is in the US. Despite that, it's still far and away the best Europe has to offer. Europe has had years and years to come up with its own competitor to Amazon, to fill the niche Amazon does, but nothing has emerged. Ordering online in Europe (at least in smaller countries) is still as painful as it was 10+ years ago. 

&gt;How many people would stay if they had to pay for search ? I don't know. But suddenly, there would be a barrier to entry, and people would think twice before using Google.

It would probably be a subscription service. People would likely pay this subscription service, because they can't really imagine not having access to search. However, we managed to live our lives without search in the past. Some people will simply just not have access to search if Google were to charge money for it. Those people simply wouldn't have access to as much information online as easily anymore. That's just a net loss for the actual people. Remember, these companies exist to provide a service to *people*. People use them because they have something to gain from using them. They don't exist just as a pinata for money.

&gt;There are alternatives for reddit and YT. They aren't successful because it's frictionless to get there and start something.

There are no real alternatives to Youtube. Nobody offers 55% of the ad revenue to creators on their videos for just signing up. Even Twitch gives you a worse deal and it's much more difficult to actually start earning revenue on Twitch. Nobody else offers anything close to this. This simply makes Youtube the best service for the creators and the creators attract viewers.

I understand what you're saying about friction, but my point is that these are services that enrich people's lives. They offer something to *people*. Painting them out to be the bad guy willynilly is likely to just make the people who use their services lose out. It's entirely possible for services like this to one day simply just not offer their service in Europe. It's unlikely that Google won't offer their service in Europe, but it could be that the next Google or some other service won't offer it in Europe or will do so in limited capacity.

894,"&gt;What gives the majority of EU states the right to dictate tax and foreign affairs policy to the minority?

Um, you literally just described the democratic process?  The only exceptions to this process are areas of discrimination, which are usually protected in the constitution.  Otherwise, the majority rules.  In the EU's case, they don't use simple majority, but qualified majority, which is a higher threshhold.

&gt;The EU is not the US. It is not a state. It is a collection of individually sovereign states which have voluntarily delegated aspects of their sovereignty to the EU. Tax and foreign affairs have not been voluntarily given up; the EU therefore has no right to dictate anything in these areas to the member states.

It is a political and economic union; a confederation.  For all intents and purposes, the EU is a state in the political and economic spheres.  Those sovereign states are in the EU to integrate.  This word is often misunderstood.  What are they integrating into?  **A state.**  Taxation has not been introduced at the European level, but Foreign Affairs has.  As for the latter, you can have policy areas that are concurrent, meaning shared and at both the European and national levels.  Macron is simply advocating making European level Foreign Affairs policy more coherent with reforms.  There's no dictating or ordering.  He is giving his position before a debate on what to change.  That's expected of any politician involved, imo.

Lastly, the EU doesn't dictate anything.  Decisions made at the European level are still made by the same people, your elected leaders and parliamentarians.

963,"&gt; coming from a neutral.

What is exactly your definition of someone being neutral? If I got it right, you're precisely from a Commonwealth nation (as you even refer to it in your flair), Australia I presume?
Australia and the UK have strong cultural and historical ties so saying you're neutral on this is questionable at best.

&gt; Logistics? France has just three old and very low capacity replenishment ships versus the UK’s 9 (which are significantly higher capacity, newer and faster). It’s in large parts the vast difference in the size of the logistics fleet that means the RN/RFA displaces two and half the amount the FN does.
 
On paper, french navy seems stronger having a proper aircraft carrier, something that royal navy lacked until recently. 

French have a few more ships but british ships are on average a bit larger and more modern. UK has slightly larger nuclear submarine fleet, but again, those subs are both larger and more modern. French have many maritime patrol and anti submarine aircraft. 

&gt; Also, France has no overseas naval bases to use as replenishment hubs outside Africa and the Near East 

Which is blatantly wrong, since [France has military bases in its own overseas territories scattered in the Indian, Carribbean, Pacific and Antarctic Oceans.](http://www.defense.gouv.fr/var/dicod/storage/images/base-de-medias/images/terre/terre-images/cartes/carte-posture-operationnelle-160812/1911690-1-fre-FR/carte-posture-operationnelle-160812.jpg).

Both sides have roughly similar number of various bases and airports. France is larger though and has more strategic depth with the location of its airbases.

&gt; In the air? France has absolutely zero heavy lift aircraft, the biggest it gets is the A400M which can just about manage a 30t lift albeit at the price of massively reduced range versus the U.Ks C17s which can transport armour huge distances. The same goes for rotary wing; France has nothing that comes close to the capacity the U.K.s Chinooks have which means they struggle to move materiel around the theatre. It’s for these reasons France has been using the RCAF and RAF for logistics in Mali. 

France has a few more combat airplanes, and their fleet is more multirole. They would have more available planes for both ground strike and air superiority missions. But the British typhoon fighters are a bit better than french Rafales, and are clearly superior to older Mirages. Their Tornado strike planes are also more capable than french mirage and etendard strikers. UK has a slight edge in aerial early warning. While most of its awacs platforms are helicopters, numbers do matter as more orbits can be maintained.

British have less capable land based SAM systems. Today UK relies solely on very short ranged systems. French SAM network includes long ranged SAMs. French planes wouldn’t need to worry over SAM threat if flying over 5000 m of altitude, while british planes could be attacked at any altitude. 

As for land forces, regular french army is a bit larger, but britain has a few times more reservists. France has more paramilitary troops, though.

Both sides have similar number of quality tanks in active use, with french a bit more in storage. French main infantry vehicles are fairly light, most of them not very advanced and all are wheeled. British infantry vehicles are no more advanced, but they’re better protected.

As for budgets they is a slight advantage for France, with $57B for France vs $48B for the UK in 2016.

In conclusion it's a matchup of two equals.

Your obvious intention to omit important facts to compare both armies makes me wonder seriously as to how neutral you can portray yourself while not even being able to compare both armies thoroughly.",,/r/europe/comments/f4ota3/number_of_times_article_5_of_the_nato_agreement/fhtm37s/,Ceredigiondragon,1581875730

Ok. For one, you do not know what ship-to-shore means. It has nothing to do with sealift ships, it refers to boats and craft carrying load from a ship to, well the shore. The Point class are no ship-to-shore connectors.

Second, calm your tits because you also have no clue about shipbuilding since there are RoRo ferries significantly larger than the Point class which we still refer to as ferries.

Third, this is only the case so long as there‘s virtually no opposition and one has access to the harbour infrastructure the Point class ships are dependent on to get anything onshore.

I was taking a walk through the park the other day, and I found a man raping a woman behind some bushes. As soon as the man saw me, he jumped back up on his feet and ran away. The poor woman was at this point unconscious, so took up my phone and called SOS. 

After only a few seconds, someone responds: ""What's the emergency?""
 
I explain everything that has happened and the person at the other end of the line tells me that an ambulance is on its way, but no police will arrive. I was a bit shocked, no police? I clarified that a serious crime has been committed here and that it's necessary for at least one police officer to arrive at the scene. 

The SOS operator stays silent for a brief moment and then says: ""We are sorry sir. We can't send a police officer, because they are all out chasing people who have sent mean tweets.""
 
""What?"" I replied, stunned by what I had just heard.

After a short moment of struggling to find words, I finally replied:
""can't you just tell one of them to come here, help out and then continue chasing the mean tweeters.""

The operator reluctantly replied: ""it is not possible. If a police officer is chasing a mean tweeter, he has to see the job through, he can't switch to a more important case if he is already assigned to mean tweet control.""

""Why not?"" I asked annoyed.

The operator replied: ""No one knows. All I know is that it has something to do with a certain kind of magic called Falsius Premissius. It's simply too advanced for any of us to understand""

How strange, I thought. At least it's now clear to me that the SOS operator has no control about whether or not the police will arrive, so I said good bye and hung up the phone. Only a few minutes later, the ambulance arrived, took the poor victim with them and left for the hospital.

That's not wait you said at all wtf. 

You said ""There is a correlation between long-term democratic rule and development"" and ""the top fastest growing nations are all democratic, even if they aren't as stable democracies as those in more developed countries for obvious reasons""

Not only did you claim a correlation between long term democratic rule and development you even claim relatively unstable democracies were still the most successful in development. Both points that the data easily disproves.

&gt;Like Japan and South Korea? You're picking only the examples that fit your preconceptions.

Japan wasn't one of the four tigers lol, they started development a decade or two before the four.

At least. Since children don't pay taxes, that per capita number would probably be closer to 30.

And then that is assuming everyone pays. The whole point is that there's net contributors and net beneficiaries in the EU, and clearly it's not the net beneficiaries that are expected to fill the gap. So 50, minimum, is a safe guess.

1011,"&gt; Without agreement, everything risks grinding to a halt in just nine months’ time, including the flow of cohesion funds, the cash dedicated to supporting the poorest member states. 

That's not true. If there's no agreement, the budget for 2021 will be the same as the one for this year. It works as with the budgets of countries, if there's no agreement on the new budget, you continue with the percentages agreed before. 

The piece, even if appearing in the Guardian, a normally pro-EU newspaper, exaggerates a bit the role of the UK. Negotiations over 7-years budgets were always tough but let's not lose sight over the fact that the differences are over 0,1% of EU GNI i.e. the 'Frugals' want the budget to be 1% of GNI, while the other ones (the 'Friends of cohesion') call for 1,1%, with Michel's proposal coming somewhere in the middle. 

At the same time, the debate is too much skewered by/focused on this difference. The truth is that EU member state proclaim a lot of new goals and priorities (Green Deal, protecting EU borders and doing a lot more to reduce migration, a lot of projects on European defence, Digital Europe, European public prosecutor, new EU space policy etc. etc.) but then fail to match the grand plans with the appropriate funding.

1292,"&gt;What’s moral is also never defined by the mi minorities opinion, as actually the worst kind of slavery say, the Belgian Congo and King Leopold’s over it where only seen as moral by a vast minority, sadly the people in power.

You failed to reply to my request. How can you claim that it's immoral to prevent actions that have been scientifically proven to contribute to our civilization's potential downfall?

&gt; You are a dude that must be insanely privileged “inconveniences peoples routine”, yeah, which is how they work to get food huh. You don’t have to I guess. Daddy pays? 

Sorry, what? You think airport and airline employees aren't paid if the airport is blocked? France isn't some libertarian shithole. Sounds like you're some posh kid yourself if you think that's how it works.

Besides, using this argument against actions that seek to prevent catastrophic outcomes is nonsensical. Would you argue that environmental regulations that target polluting industries are immoral because they might put some people out of a job?

&gt; There are tons of other things that hurt the environment more than flying commercial in cattle class which ER activists seem to hypocritically target.  If everyone flew economy we would have much less of a problem than now with all the private jets with an insane carbon footprint plus first class for the rich with Also a much larger one. 

There's always worse. Is that an argument to do nothing? Taking the plane is already worse than any other transportation method. If everyone flew economy class instead of taking the train or even the car, we'd be in much deeper shit than we already are.

&gt; ER is beyond redemption after their idiotic stunts mainly in the UK in the eyes of the vast majority of society, even the left. Blocking buses or... metro trains, the most ecological forms of transportation with idiots glueing themselves to them does not help any cause. Normal eco friendly people encourage people to take such forms of transportation. Stunts like using a diesel engine and paint to destroy facades is also total BS. 

Right, so because some of them did stupid shit, we should condemn them for whatever action they partake in, even those that actually make sense. Good thinking.

&gt; Society wants ecological activists. Nobody wants terrorists bullying the average person. 

Society wants peaceful ecological activists because it can ignore them. Protests that inconvenience nobody never make the headlines, nobody cares. Any effective protest must be disruptive, in one way or another.

&gt; Go **block some ministry**, some private aviation small airport used only by the ultra rich, **HQ of some polluting company.** Nit bold enough huh? It’s easier to bully the average Joe. 

Except they already did both of these things. Not that long ago, French ER activists blockaded the HQ of Blackrock, which bankrolls several heavily polluting companies. But then they got condemned for it by entitled people like you, saying what they did is bad because it's illegal and prevents innocent people from working (sounds familiar?). As for the ministry, I already pointed out they did but you ignored it. Convenient.

&gt; As for the intervention, it’s legal to use gas in other situations than self defense, like defense of the general public. A blocked road by a bunch of self proclaimed moral high ground privileged kids is a threat to the general public. 

Like clockwork. Even peaceful protests will cause buildups in traffic. You're essentially advocating that nobody protests, ever.

Of course, the fact that heavy GHG emissions are a threat to the general public doesn't even cross your mind.

&gt; if needed by using limited force and gas which does not cause lasting harm is better than say beating with police batons.

Shut the fuck up lol. The only reason I am in Australia is because my family fled the Nazi Regime. I fully understand the horrors the Germans did to Europe and to the world. Put we as a modern society should call out war crimes equally to our own side as the other. 

You condemn the Blitz, Rotterdam, Hiroshima and all other examples for unnecessary civilian death, but when it comes to Dresden it suddenly becomes part of the war effort. I mean just admit it, you just hate German people and relish that they died. 

Lastly, a post hoc change of opinion does not change the horrors the Nazi Regime. To say now that maybe the Allies went a bit overboard at Dresden does not in any way make you agree with the Nazis or lessen what they did.

1403,"Immigrants from the EU will have to earn at least £23,000 ($44,700) a year before they are allowed to work in Britain under plans to bring an end to unskilled migration.

The Conservative cabinet on Friday signed off plans for an Australian-style points-based immigration system to be introduced at the end of the year.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is said to have made clear that there will be no “special pleading” or “carve-outs” for sectors that face shortages, with only skilled migrants allowed to enter the UK.

‘Panic and neglect’: 355 test positive on cruise

This is despite concerns that sectors such as social care and construction will face significant shortages under the system.

A Downing Street spokesman said on Friday that it would end the “reliance on importing cheap, low-skilled labour”, adding that the number of migrants coming to the UK would fall. He declined to say when the number would fall.

“The system will be simpler and fairer and will not discriminate between countries and would return democratic control of immigration to the British people,” he said.

“The PM stressed that we must demonstrate that the UK is open and welcoming to talent from across the world but the new system would end reliance on importing cheap, low-skilled labour, bringing down immigration numbers overall.”

Last month Home Secretary Priti Patel made clear that low-skilled workers in sectors such as construction and social care would not be exempt from immigration rules despite staff shortages.

She said during a cabinet meeting that there would be no “carve-outs” under the points-based system. Although people in “shortage occupations” may be given more points under the Australian-style system, there will be no guarantee that they will be able to enter the UK.

There have been warnings that Britain will face a shortage of social-care workers if care homes are unable to recruit enough staff from overseas.

Ministers have also said that foreign construction workers should be given special treatment to ensure that Mr Johnson’s pledge to “level up” the country with £100 billion of infrastructure investment can be met.

However, Ms Patel is said to have said that exemptions for certain sectors risked undermining the new migration system, which she said should be “simpler and fairer”.

Under the scheme, migrants earning less than £25,600 will be subject to the points-based system. They will need 70 points to enter the UK. Points will be given based on salary, educational attainment, ability to speak English and job offers at an appropriate skill level.

Migrants will still be able to enter the UK if they earn as little as £23,000, although they will need a significant number of points in other areas to compensate for their lower salary.

There will be a series of salary thresholds for higher earners to ensure that they do not undercut the wages of those already working in the UK. Pilots, for example, will be expected to earn at least £60,000 before they are allowed to work in the UK.

Last month the migration advisory committee said that replacing freedom of movement with a points-based immigration system after Brexit could cut economic growth and may lead to only small improvements in standards of living.

It was also suggested that the government’s proposed overhaul of migration rules could have “zero effect” on the number of jobs available for British workers.

There are concerns that the present system is so complex that it has become a “lawyer’s paradise”.

“The immigration rules have become a real spaghetti mess,” a cabinet source said. “Even the judges think that’s the case. Priti was arguing that we need a much clearer rules-based system. She doesn’t want a system with carve-outs all over the place.’’",,/r/europe/comments/f4ngly/eu_immigrants_must_show_they_can_earn_a_living_of/fhrtzbc/,casualphilosopher1,1581838705

[Russian people go to actual forced labor prisons for posting rather innocent things in the internet.](http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1462496206)


&gt;Andrei Bubeyev, a mechanical engineer from Tver, has become the latest blogger to be jailed for material on his personal VKontakte page critical of the current regime and especially Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.  A Tver court on Thursday, May 5, found him guilty on two counts and sentenced him to 2 years in a minimum security prison-colony and prohibited him from using the Internet for a year. 


&gt;According to his lawyer Svetlana Sidorkina, Bubeyev was charged over two pieces of material he reposted on VKontakte.   The first was a poster by Anton Myrzin, otherwise known as Paperdaemon Chaognostic called “Squeeze Russia out of yourself”.  The phrase hearkens back to a letter from Anton Chekhov to a friend in which he spoke of needing “to squeeze the slave out of us, drop by drop”.  Here it is Russia that needs to be squeezed out – in the poster from a toothpaste tube.


&gt;This was deemed by the Russian investigators and court to constitute ‘public calls to extremism via the Internet’ (Article 280 § 2).  


&gt;He was also charged with reposting an article by Boris Stomakhin entitled ‘Crimea is Ukraine’.   The article would certainly annoy the current regime under President Vladimir Putin.  Stomakhin considers Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea to have been the final straw, the border dividing this world from that, good from evil.  He says that Russians should paint the word “Russian occupiers out of Crimea!” and “Russian swine, return Crimea to Ukraine!” on every wall in every Russian city”. 


&gt;Stomakhin is now himself serving a politically motivated prison sentence, and Bubeyev, who simply reposted the article has been convicted of ‘public calls to separatism via the Internet’ under Article 280.1 § 2).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/f4mwzc/police_record_120000_noncrime_hate_incidents_that/fhruzfd/,Maamuna,1581839978

1523,"I'm glad you brought up Polish sovereignty, because this is a key point of contention and confusion whenever sovereignty comes up.  Europeans often fail to understand what (con)federal status represents.  The discussion is often about the ""loss"" of sovereignty, or the necessity for member states' nations to remain sovereign.  The reality is that the multiple levels of a federal system are sovereign concurrently/simultaneously.  For example, making the EU sovereign over trade policy, as is the case currently, does not make Poland not sovereign.  It is sovereign over education, military, taxation, etc.  Regardless of making Europe more sovereign, Poland will always remain sovereign in the EU system, as in Poland will always have policy areas where it has exclusive or shared competency with other levels of the Union.  From the same token, my home US state of Minnesota is also sovereign, and my state government is in control of and makes a lot of decisions that I am happy about.  I hope this makes you more at ease about the increase of European sovereignty Macron is espousing.","Minnesota, America",/r/europe/comments/f4b1e3/macron_sets_out_10year_vision_for_eu_says_eu_must/fhrpkl3/,Trayeth,1581833613

1551,"Police have recorded nearly 120,000 “non-crime” hate incidents and may have stopped those accused from getting jobs, the Telegraph can disclose.

A High Court judge ruled on Friday the Hate Crime Operational Guidelines, which informs police work nationally, had been unlawfully used to interfere with a man’s freedom of speech.

The guidelines, rolled out six years ago by the College of Policing, state that any action perceived to be motivated by hostility towards religion, race or transgender idenitiy must be recorded “irrespective of whether there is any evidence to identify the hate element”.

Despite police accepting that such incidents are not crimes, they are still logged on a system and can even show up during a DBS check when applying for work.

A total of 119,934 non-crime incidents were formally recorded by 34 police forces in England and Wales between 2014, when the guidance was introduced, and 2019.

By far the most incidents were recorded by South Wales Police, who logged 13,856 cases over the five-year period - exceeding the country’s biggest police force, Scotland Yard, by more than 4,000.

The Metropolitan Police recorded the second most incidents at 9,473, followed by Merseyside Police, at 8,644, and Surrey Police, at 8,256, according to figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws by the Telegraph.

It comes as a former police officer, Harry Miller, won his legal battle against Humberside Police after facing investigation over alleged “transphobic” tweets.

In a landmark ruling, the High Court found the force had a “chilling effect” on the free speech rights of Mr Miller by visiting his place of work and suggesting he may face prosecution.

The married father-of-four was contacted by a ‘community cohesion officer’ last year after a Twitter user complained he had shared a ""transphobic limerick"".

Mr Justice Julian Knowles compared the actions of the police to the Stasi and Gestapo, as he ruled the tweets were lawful and said there was not “the slightest risk” Mr Miller would commit a criminal offence by continuing to tweet.

The right to hold opinions ranging from the inoffensive to ""the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome and the provocative"", he said, was a “cardinal democratic freedom"".

""The effect of the police turning up at his place of work because of his political opinions must not be underestimated,” his judgment concluded.

""To do so would be to undervalue a cardinal democratic freedom. In this country we have never had a Cheka, a Gestapo or a Stasi. We have never lived in an Orwellian society.""

Clutching a copy of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four outside court, Mr Miller, 54, hailed the outcome as a “watershed moment for liberty” and vowed to continue tweeting.

His solicitor, Paul Conrathe, claimed the ruling meant it was “entirely acceptable to hold the view and communicate that a trans woman is not a woman”.

“That view is not hateful, transphobic or unlawful,” he said in a statement.

The 65-page judgment said the reaction of the woman who complained about Mr Miller's tweets, named only as Mrs B, was, at times, ""at the outer margin of rationality"".

The judge said the statement of Mrs B - which suggested Mr Miller would have been antisemitic during the Second World War and that transgender people could ""kiss their rights goodbye"" if he won the case - represented an ""extreme mindset"".

He said her evidence ""would tend to confirm"" the view of an academic expert that ""some involved in the transgender debate are prepared to accuse others with whom they disagree of showing hatred, or as being transphobic when they are not, but simply hold a different view"".

The case has echoes of recent legal battles over transgender issues, including Maya Forstater, a tax expert who lost her job over alleged “offensive” tweets.

The 45-year-old, who used social media to question government proposals to allow people to self-identify as the opposite sex, took her employer to a tribunal last year.

However, in her case, an employment judge ruled there was no legal right to question whether a transgender person is a man or woman and decided Ms Forstater’s view was ""incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others”.

It is expected Friday's case will now be tested at the Supreme Court, after Mr Justice Knowles granted a “leapfrog certificate” to allow it to skip the Court of Appeal stage.

Ian Wise QC, representing Mr Miller, cited non-crime statistics previously revealed by the Telegraph as he asked for the certificate, telling the court: ""I say that it is an issue that is inevitably going to go the Supreme Court at some juncture in the near future and there is some urgency about this - these issues are arising on a daily basis.""

Mr Justice Knowles rejected Mr Miller's wider challenge to the lawfulness of the College of Police guidance, ruling that it ""serves legitimate purposes and is not disproportionate"".",,/r/europe/comments/f4mwzc/police_record_120000_noncrime_hate_incidents_that/fhrr2zk/,tre3211,1581835245

That's funny cause this own culture shaming ideology is mostly propagated by useless and weak peple, often studying useless humanities. Generally, people I've met who seemed to actively engage in this identity politics usually did not have much else going for them - which makes sense, you don't have time to think about how your culture is actually not a culture when you're working your ass off either studying or doing some engineering and invest time in your actual hobbies after work.

&gt; can‘t brag about their fake ""accomplishment"" such as nationality and skin colour 

Why brag? I think most people are just proud of their ancestors and their own identity in the world, which is tied to them and their country. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's scary that there's a growing movement in Europe that thinks there IS something wrong.

&gt; Why dont you just learn more languages or skills if you have time to make such wasteful video.  

Yeah because learning a new language is comparable to watching a one minute long ad. Not to mention, if you actually did some mentally straining work, you would know your brain can only take so much in one day and you actually do need to 'turn off' in the evening.

1667,"This thread has a dire lack of factual analysis, and of course, the usual British posters who shit up every single Irish thread are in with their half-baked takes muddying up the discussion.

So let's clear up the ""affordability"" question once and for all. It has been modeled in depth by former IMF economist Gunther Thumann, and it was indicated that the books would balance, on the condition that the UK upholds it's obligations to public sector workers pensions for the years under the employ of the British government - no reason why they wouldn't, they already pay retired staff living in the Republic.

[Here is the paper](https://senatormarkdaly.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/imf-merged-.pdf)

Anybody commenting ITT without having read it in detail is talking out of their ass.

Then the so-called ""subvention"" from London covers things like all-UK military spending (which doesn't get replaced) and public spending, the British government has a vested interest in cooking the books to ensure NI appears to be as unviable as possible to unify with the Republic. 

The final chestnut (always *always* brought up) is healthcare. ""BUT THE NHS!"" they crow. Northern Ireland doesn't have the NHS, for starters. It does have free healthcare at the point of access, but the service provision is so abysmal that patients are increasingly travelling to the republic for treatment. You could argue that they wouldn't accept the republic's cost-up-front system, but for anyone below a very generous means, healthcare in the republic is absolutely free (medical card), and above that, capped. Ultimately with limited resources, having it universally free is just a subsidy to the rich, at the cost of having less to invest in the system. The result is very obvious. Life expectancy in NI is *6 years* lower than the republic. Cardiac and stroke death rates are *double* the rate of the republic within 30 days of the incident.

And that's saying nothing of the benefits. The border region is disastrously poor on both sides because of constant disruption. Average incomes after cost of living is factored in are *5000 euro per year* higher in the republic than the North. Welfare payments are higher. 

More than all that it would be just. The creation of Northern Ireland began a century of brutal sectarianism, beginning with a pogrom of 7500 catholic workers in Belfast, and punctuated constantly by state-approved and perpetrated mass-murder incidents, people being burned out of their homes, and an apartheid state operating with the full approval of the British state. There is nothing worth saving of the nasty, evil little statelet called Northern Ireland or any of it's vestiges. Protestants have lived in the republic since independence almost totally without incident, and certainly nothing you could call state discrimination. The small-minded sectarian-driven fears of Protestants were the reason NI was created to begin with, and the reason the conflict endured and deepened there, where it died out in the Republic almost immediately. It is time to correct this historic mistake. We can afford it, and we can't afford *not* to do it.",,/r/europe/comments/f488w4/the_economist_publication_says_irish_unification/fhrmdgl/,AshChokesem,1581830471

It was more than 300 near the end of the war. We know that Sendlerowa was helping to smuggle children out of Ghetto before joining Żegota. 500 is a save assessment. 

The number 2 500 was first mentioned in 1979 book written by Teresa Prekerowa, in a statement made by four most active members of the action:  Irena Sendlerowej, Wanda Drozdowska-Rogowiczowa, Izabela Kuczkowska and Jadwiga Piotrowska. They said that """"We determine this number (today, after almost forty years, it is difficult to determine accurately) on about 2,500 children, to whom Żegota provided help in various ways"". It is most likely the overall number of kids in which Żegota, but also other organisations, like Rada Główna Opiekuńcza, were helping. It was in most cases very symbolic aid, the main burden was on orphanages, monasteries, individual families.

The difference is that by working as a community on issues that affect the whole continent, the European issues of the economy, security, etc., Poland gain disproportionately to its size.  That applies to all states in the Union.  The future will be dominated by superstates, and Europe can either be a playground or a player.

The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, administering justice on behalf of the King by judges and magistrates.**",Europe,/r/europe/comments/f4ensh/vicepresident_of_spain/fhr7204/,QuantumMartini,1581819072

1996,"I build trails through forests for hikers, mountain bikers, etc.   I have worked heavily with conservation areas, land managers, etc.   One of the areas we built in recently is partially a pine plantation.   They generally do this with land that has been reclaimed from farm land or other open fields.    This land was never harvested and eventually became part of a conservation area.   In discussion with the land managers we found out that in order to make the land somewhat diverse you need to either cut down the majority or all of it and replant.    Pine plantations are planed to maximise the number of trees for harvest nor for biodiversity.    As forest they are garbage with little to no undergrowth.    The place we were dealing with ended up removing at least half the trees in the pine plantation to give room to replant and allow a natural forest to develop.  So the idea that cutting down trees is bad is just not true in many cases.   Every person that I talked to who knew anything about forests, trees, etc thought these pine plantations were the absolute worst and you would be much better off clear cutting and starting over with a properly diverse forest system.

There is little to none.   The reason for this is a pine plantation was never designed to be a forest.   It was designed to plant as many trees as possible for future harvesting.    Because the trees are packed together there is little other chance of other plants to thrive.   Then you have the pine needle layer that can literally be inches deep.

2027,"Firstly, for those saying it will never happen, vetoes have been slowly removed from policy areas for decades.  Currently, the veto only exists in ""the most sensitive areas,"" including taxation, defense, foreign affairs, and enlargement.  These are the final remaining areas where the veto exists that Macron wants to see reformed to be QMV instead.  Removing the veto is actually a democratic thing, not an undemocratic one.  Currently, most taxation and foreign affairs decisions get blocked by only one or two states each go around.  How many people on this sub keep claiming tax needs to reform to remove tax haven attributes from Luxembourg and the Netherlands, or to enforce large corporation taxes on companies hiding in Ireland?  How many people insult and lose faith in the ability of the EU to act because Greece vetoes a criticism of China, or France is the only guarantor of security in West Africa? 
These issues remain unresolved in part due to the remaining vetoes.  This is exactly the deadlock the EU and Europe generally needs to be rid of.  France and Germany would not ""dominate"" the EU any more than now, as QMV requires 55% of member states representing 65% of EU population to pass.  Germany and France are only two states.  The Union will never be fully functional, democratic, and capable while these vetoes remain.  Lastly, in areas such as defense, members could opt-out, such as Denmark already has during previous reforms.  That's okay.  The Union need operable capabilities, and opted-out states can always opt-in later on.

Still it can't really be connected with Istria as Istria was under international occupation for a time after WW2. What did however happen in Istria that we can call a genocide was when the Serbo-Croatian language was banned there in 1920. Expulsion of academics, burning books in Serbo-Croatian, firing Croats from jobs, destroying what was produced by Croats (fruits and wine), banning of Croatian tombstones and toponyms, closing of Croatian schools, italianisation of last names, physical liquidation of Croatian nationalists... It began a huge exodus of Croats. Many Italian colonists feared the Partisans because they knew Partisans would consider them fascist supporters and colonists (which they were) so in turn they migrated back to Italy. During the 40 days that SFRY controlled Istria, 15000 fascists were killed but you can hardly call that a genocide, as it wasn't limited to Italians, didn't target Italians and didn't exterminate Italians.",Rep.

2233,"I don't doubt that. It's a complicated matter, since if you rely only on popular ideas of beauty, you end up moving towards kitch, towards just repeating history instead of creating something new. Like I love the design of Oodi, and it is widely praised by people, but if we would have relied on classical styles, it would never have been built and instead we would have gotten another classical building that Helsinki already has a lot of. It's easy to want classical style when you don't know what the new thing could be.

Then we also have to consider that a lot of modern architecture isn't really made with aesthetics in mind, but developers wanting efficiently to build real estate. For example [this new tower in Helsinki](https://www.kiinteistoposti.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Majakka-678x381.jpg) is horrible IMO. It's just because the real estate firm wanted to build a lot of flats without much architectural ambition.

So a lot of modern architecture isn't because architects are unable to design something beautiful. It's also because of capitalism, where investors want efficient real estate.

Tbh when I asked for a source, it's not because you are saying wrong things, I honestly don't know, that's why I was curious to know why you said Muhammad was never used before.

Still saying just because you're Arab you know everything of the Arabic culture or history isn't something that would convince me at all.

There have been one post made about the very topic : [Was Muhammad a common pre-Islamic name in the Arabian Peninsula?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/66ne6u/was_muhammad_a_common_preislamic_name_in_the/), with some interesting answer if you're curious to look at them.
u/frogbrooks' answer is quite complete with thorough research and sources, here's his answer:

[i]""Similar to what /u/Atheist-Messiah says, it is hard to know for sure. I tried to answer this same question three months ago and this is what I found though. Although it existed in pre-Islamic times, its use was not common (at least among the Quraysh) and skyrocketed in popularity after Muhammad and Islam rose to fame and power:

I spent around an hour looking but couldn't find too much. There is an article from 1936 (so methodologies have definitely changed since then) by Edward Jabra Jurji that claims that the name Muhammad has been in use in Arabia since the first-millennium B.C.E.

Jurji cites Kitāb al-Ishtiqāq written by Ibn Durayd (~10th century C.E) that the name Muhammad had been used prior to the birth of the prophet Muhammad in ~570C.E. However, it wasn't a customary name of the Quraysh tribe themselves. Muhammad's grandfather allegedly named him Muhammad so that he would ""be praised in the heavens and the earth"" (the name Muhammad is derived from the Arabic root ḥ-m-d meaning to praise and can literally be seen as the passive participle meaning ""the one that is praised"").

Just to be safe, I checked the Arabic of Kitāb al-Ishtiqāq and found the quote attributed to Muhammad's grandfather as well as a list of others who had been named Muhammad before the Prophet himself.

Jujri also said that the name Muhammad had been found in Southern Arabian inscriptions and cited the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum (The Collection of Semitic Inscriptions). However, when I tried to find the references inside of it I could not locate them (Volume 2, Tome 1, #353 and Tome 2, #420). This is probably due to my own inexperience with the Corpus though.

So at least according to Jujri and Ibn Durayd, the name Muhammad had indeed at least existed before the prophet was born. However, at least among the Quraysh it does not appear to be very popular. This can be backed up by the fact that in lists of early notable Ṣaḥāba (companions of the prophet) there are only 1 or 2 other Muhammads found. However, after a few generations we can find 137 with the name Muhammad. As you can see on the second list, a lot of them are ""Muhammad ibn xxx al-Ansari"" meaning that they were the sons of the residents of Medina who converted to Islam when Muhammad made it his home after fleeing Mecca. Thus, much of the popularity of the name can be attributed to the prominence of the Prophet, and not necessarily that it was a popular name before.

In fact the first documented such food was written in Homer's Odyssey written around 800 B.C.[1] In the fifth century B.C.

Spanish knew it well in 16th century

2371,"It's an impossible questions to answer. Too many variables.

Here's how you make it work though:
Quick Polictical Transition (In terms of Sovereignty/EU membership, gradual Financial transition plus stimulus package.

Let's pick a date of transition after all the referendum have been passed in March of 2023 of say 1st July 2025

From this date Ireland is Reunified, 32 country Republic, the Dail is the Parliament in Dublin. The island is an EU member.
Stormont is a regional assembly respredenting NI in the Dail until the next national Election, which would be under PR STV multi seat constituency system.


A dual funding system is run.
The Irish Government spins up Northern Ireland funding pre unification from late 2023, while the British maintains spending level pre transition and post transition it is gradually lowered over 5-10 years
Similar to the EU divorce.

This avoids any shocks, actually increases the money the NI gets in real terms for a while and makes sure all commitments are seen to.

Meanwhile a 3rd Investment fund is prepared by the EU. A successful transition is in the EUs interests.

Post Unification the Irish Government heavily subsidises various industry to move to Belfast and Derry, the 2nd and 3rd biggest cities in Ireland, which have a much cheaper cost of living compared to Dublin. This also eases the ridiculous pressure in Dublin.

The North West, now boarder free gets the sensible investment in rail and road transport that's it desperately needs and becomes a more viable land.

Dublin decentralizes some all Ireland functions to Northern locations such as the Dept of Health or similar as a jobs boost.

Also by then I hope weed is legalised greatly reducing police and judicial costs while generating hundreds of millions in tax which is rooted there.

2379,"&gt; Conjecture.

Everything is about conjectures when dealing with the future. Experts as you were referring to them earlier are also making conjectures and projections but in economics those are always far off the actual economical scenario (check just GDP projections it's very rare when they match with the actual figures), the image of Boeing and how seriously it was affected by the accidents is hard to quantify because we're precisely dealing with human emotions.
[S&amp;P and other finance institutions already downgraded Boeing and are expected to downgrade it further for 2020.](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-12-18/boeing-cut-one-notch-at-moody-s-as-737-max-grounding-extends)

&gt; If there will be an effect it'll be a limited one. Again, Boeing's not going anywhere.

It will be limited or not. These accidents had worldwide repercussions similar to what happened to the Concorde, and as you perhaps noticed, Concorde never recovered from it. Still I believe Boeing will overcome this but it is going to take some time before credibility and trustworthiness come back.
Have in mind the 737max was the jewel of their industry. Seeing it taking a huge blow isn't without consequences.

&gt; Like it or not, aerospace is a heavily subsidised and protected industry. Complain about hypocrisy all you want, it won't change anything. But massive direct state aid probably won't even be necessary for Boeing, as I wrote they secured private financing already.

It's not about liking it or not but simple observation. Both are heavily subsidised and that's why none of them will fail. Not because Boeing secured few billions loans, private financing comes because creditors know Boeing and Airbus are going to be saved by public funding, not because they believe in their future. Nonetheless, you seem too optimistic about Boeing, their current sales result is disastrous. And I would be more cautious and wait for another year to see if Boeing realistically overcame its current crisis.

&gt; They won't rise to previous levels because the global aviation industry is in a (smooth) downturn now, yes that's including Airbus.

Of course there is global downturn but also the crisis Boeing is facing with serious dysfunctions and a disastrous image worldwide. You can't really take this out.

&gt; To what extent the market situation will change is difficult to say, I predict a few percent of market share going to Airbus in the mid-term but the basic situation of an Airbus-Boeing duopoly will not be altered.

As I said, Boeing will not disappear and I agree with you that duopoly is going to be a thing for the foreseeable future. 

But as long as Boeing can't come up with a new plane that would be a serious competitor of Airbus' Neo, Boeing sales won't go higher even with subsides and monopolies in some US markets. 
Commercial plane demands are mostly growing in Asia and Middle East and are a golden opportunity for sales, if Boeing miss them even with US support it won't realistically be able to compete with Airbus anymore.",,/r/europe/comments/f43q6f/us_raises_tariffs_on_european_aircraft_in_ongoing/fhovb6d/,Ceredigiondragon,1581775055

2427,"Cost of living is *too low*? Are you being intentionally obtuse?

In many major urban areas, the rent for a small apartment is upwards of $2000 a month. The absolute most ghetto apartments in LA for example are no less than ~$1200 a month, and that's *with additional assistance in paying rent*. Just because a 2BR apartment in the middle of Idaho is $500/month doesn't mean all of America has equally affordable housing.


Taxing the wealthy is not going to make them all suddenly dip out, that is the biggest scam people are being told here. Of course they'll tell you that. The reality is that the wealth tax will barely even sent their cash flow, they'll still be absurdly wealthy and they'll end up staying here. Besides where the fuck are they gonna go? Europe taxes the rich more than we do. Not like they're going to ""live large"" and hide in some third world country either; even a middle class American could go live it up in a poor destitute country when 1 US dollar is worth like 500+ dollars in their local currency.



Raising minimum wage *increases* wages so they remain competitive. If you're making $20/hr (well above minimum wage) now at a $7.25/hr federal minimum wage, then at a $15/hr federal wage you'd be getting a nice raise to $25/hr.

If you scroll down you will see on of those rules is:

3 year average of the [current account balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_account_balance) as a percentage of GDP, with an indicative threshold of +6% and -4%.

In case you don't understand why there are positive limits on the current account balance, lets just say that if you have a monetary union and someone keeps having large or consistent surpluses they will get richer and richer at the cost of the other countries.

If not, tell me, what's the valid reason behind not counting all imports as imports and having an exception for government expenditure?

Here in Portugal, to a greater or lesser extent, for about a century that economic policy is based on substituting imports with national production. The results are debatable, though the logic is sound or it wouldn't be used by most countries around the world

You seem to know too much on economic theory but too little on industrial production and value chain because when it comes to that your reasoning is ridiculous. The idea that production is a trade off only works if all resources are already being utilized. That most often isn't the case. If you are using previously unused resources, you aren't taking away from anything.

The only course left is for Japan's one hundred million people to sacrifice their lives by charging the enemy to make them lose the will to fight."" - Japan war ministry during ww2. Although possible, it was very unlikely Japan was going to surrender.

The allies had no troops on the mainland of Japan and without a concrete surrender would have to conduct a d-day similar landing. As apposed to Germany where they were moving towards Berlin every day. [The original target](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan#Manhattan_Project) for the atomic bomb was Germany but in may 1945 it was decided that as Germany would surrender before the Manhattan Project would be finished. For the Allies to decide against bombing Germany as a way to secure victory is indicative of them knowing an imminent surrender was coming well before Dresden.

&gt;  If it was retaliation for anything, it was retaliation for the millions of people killed across Europe in German air Raids... But bombing them in return isn't fair?

No, this is abhorrent thinking and you should really take a long hard look at yourself to even consider it. Intentionally murdering civilians for the crimes of the government is a war crime.

2830,"&gt; To put it simply, so that you don't get lost

It's you who isn't understanding what I'm saying. To put it simply: I'm not saying that the government is spending more or less money, I'm saying that the government is spending more money on government investment/consumption and less on imports. 

&gt;  the accounting difference you talk about is either some Soviet style accounting trick you use in Eastern Europe or you're mixing up two different things.

I'm using standard macroeconomic national accounting.
M+Y=C+G+I+X &lt;-&gt; Y=C+G+I+NX

Where M = imports, Y= production, C= private consumption, G= public consumption, I= investment, X= exports, NX= net exports.
That's how spending is formally separated in national accounting. Imports are not public consumption. It has nothing to do with public balance of payments. That you don't know this means you're not educated in economics. 

&gt; Then, the premise of my comment, which you seem to have lost is that the euro is being used. As a result currency valuation or devaluation is negligible to non existant

I never lost that. It's you who do not understand what real exchange rate is, even though I defined it for you. Even if we assumed that Poland uses the Euro, *it still has a national real exchange rate*, because real exchange rate is defined as:
ε=e(P/P*)

Where the real exchange rate ε equals the nominal exchange rate e multiplied by the ratio of price levels between domestic prices P and foreign prices P*.
To make it clear for our example: real exchange rate of Poland=nominal exchange rate of euro multiplied by (consumer prices in Poland divided with consumer prices in the rest of the world). The reduction in imports answered by an increase in government production leads to rising domestic prices in Poland, which means the real exchange rate appreciates, which lowers exports, which cancels out the balance of payments gain from lowered imports. 

If in our example you're talking about the government paying for everything in euro while still using zloty, the government still has to get those euro somehow, and it doesn't change the fundamental fact of how polish productive capabilities are utilized.

&gt; Lastly, are you saying that industrial activity doesn't generate tax revenue?

I never said that. But tax revenue isn't actually additional value, it's just moving value. That's what I said. 

&gt;  If the goods are made somewhere else, their production generated tax revenue to some other country.

The productive capabilities utilized to make the tanks are not taken from another country, they are taken from domestic production, which also pays taxes. 

&gt; It seems you're just trying to apply economic concepts and theories and trying to make them fit the situation when they don't apply or are not significant while also trying to mock some things I said and totally making a fool of yourself in the process.

What I'm saying is orthodox economics. Trade is beneficial, domesticating production does not improve balance of payments or tax revenues. Here's how it is explained in the most used economics textbook in the world, Mankiw's Principles of Economics:
https://imgur.com/a/JHxSXW1

&gt; If the government pays 200€ for a tank that comes from somewhere else, then that's it, but if it pays that same amount and the industrial activity that was involved is taxed, then it gets something back out of it. Where's the doubt there?

I already told you, domesticating production means the real exchange rate appreciates, which reduces exports and therefore tax revenues. You're not taking productive capabilities from another country, you're taking them from your own country. 

&gt; By your logic no country would ever want to produce anything

A country should only produce what it is comparatively best at producing. This is the orthodox economic conclusion. If person A can produce 20 beer per hour but only 10 bread, but person B can produce 20 bread per hour but only 10 beer, maximum efficiency is achieved if A produces 20 beer and B produces 20 bread = 20 beer and bread. Person A can then trade 10 beer for 10 bread and end up with 10 beer and 10 bread. 
 You're saying that person A is better off if he only produces beer half the time and uses the rest of the time to make his own bread, ending up with 10 beer and 5 bread, because then he doesn't have to give his beer away to some dirty foreigner. 

&gt; The idea that any country is at the limit of its productive capability is laughable at best.

Not at all, it's orthodox economics. In the long run, growth is limited by productive capabilities. In the short run, growth vacillates around the limit of productive capabilities so that productive capabilities are overutilized in an upturn and underutilized in a downturn. Public policy can raise
GDP in the long run only by improving the productive capability of the
economy.  
&gt; ou then continue talking about import vs government expenditure, when what were talking about is where and not if that government money is being spent.

I was always talking about that, not about whether the government was using more or less money. 

&gt; At least in western Europe government spending is counted towards imports just like every other import, that distinction if it exists anywhere is just a cheap trick to make the data look better

Sure it is, which is why I pointed out that you had misunderstood me. I was not talking about whether or not the government was spending more or less money, but rather on how the national product is utilized, on government production or on imports, in line with the principles of national accounting.",,/r/europe/comments/f367ov/what_a_world_polish_tanks_advancing_through_a/fho5yj5/,IcyTemporary,1581742582

2835,"&gt; Greek Speaker of the House Constantine Tassoulas rebuked MeRA25 leader and ex-Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis on Friday for handing an envelope over to him containing a USB of the conversations he had secretly recorded while attending a Eurogroup discussion in Brussels in 2015 and asking him to “use them as he sees fit.”
&gt; 
&gt; The incident happened in the Greek Parliament during a discussion on the government’s labor policies and after Varoufakis had addressed the plenary.
&gt; 
&gt; During his comments on wages, Varoufakis mentioned that he was depositing the Eurogroup recordings with the President of the body before leaving, and he then read a Supreme Court decision which he said found the recordings legal, since they were made while carrying out his duties as Minister.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaker Tassoulas returned the package to Varoufakis in a clear state of outrage, while telling him to “assume his own responsibilities” and not turn the Parliamentary President “into a bearer of his own responsibilities.”
&gt; 
&gt; The President then related to the Parliament members, “Shortly before leaving for the funeral of his best friend, as he told us, Mr. Varoufakis left a confidential, as he said, envelope for the President of the Parliament through MeRA25’s parliamentary group president.
&gt; 
&gt; “He assumed, in a speech delivered before he left for the funeral of his best friend, as he said, that the contents of this envelope relates to his secret recording of proceedings of top-level collective bodies of the European Union and thus apparently gave me the right, as he said, before leaving for the funeral of his best friend, the right to decide if I will pass it on to party leaders,” Tassoulas stated, barely able to rein in his anger.
&gt; 
&gt; The Speaker continued, declaring “I wanted to say that when someone feels the urge to assume an initiative – to announce secret recordings he has made – he must personally assume the responsibility of implementing this initiative. I do not see myself or the Parliament here as a porter or bearer of Mr. Varoufakis’ responsibilities.
&gt; 
&gt; “Therefore I am immediately summoning a staff member and returning Mr. Varoufakis’ letter as unacceptable. Parliament is not going to be turned into a bearer of any responsibility Mr. Varoufakis may personally wish to assume by revealing such secret recordings,” the President concluded.
&gt; 
&gt; The issue of Varoufakis’ secret recordings of the Eurogroup meetings during the first six months of the SYRIZA government of 2015, which eventually led to the referendum and the third bailout of the Greek economy, continues to create political tensions in Greece and in the EU as a whole.
&gt; 
&gt; The ex-Finance Minister claims that he did so as part of his duties and added that other ministers do it as well, but his claims continue to spark strong criticism from a wide spectrum of Greece’s political players, including SYRIZA, the party for which he was originally elected in January 2015.

Uk is currently a petri-dish to test the future of global corporate emperors who will be immune to any national law.  Very exciting to see how things will evolve.

I can't view the ad at the moment, but from what I can recall was in it:

A father thanking [Switzerland](https://www.ch.ch/en/paternity-leave/) for parental leave is just a bit silly.  

US was the one to take the first steps in empowering the women's rights movement? It was no doubt an important movement, but not the superlatively early. As for countries truly empowering it, I'd take a look at your own doorstep before looking to cross the ocean.

Danishes are Danish. Puff pastries aren't, but that's not the same thing. 

Swedish meatballs is a completely different dish from what Charles XII supposedly brought back from the Ottomans. They're both balls of meat, but that's pretty much where the similarities end. 

It's true the first paperclip probably was invented by an American, but there's no evidence the Norwegian who made a paperclip didn't invent his independently. It was a much worse paperclip than the American one anyway. 

The maypole isn't known to be German, it's origin is unknown. It most likely stems from prehistoric pagan traditions and can be seen all over the Germanic culture sphere. It's quite likely to have stemmed from Scandinavia. And the *Midsummer* pole tradition specifically is quite Swedish. 

*Our* democracy is not the same as the democracy of Ancient Greece, nor did Scandinavians go and take democracy back from Greece. Probably goes without saying, but so does the fact that absolutely no Scandinavian thinks we invented democracy...

And of course everything is not copied. And Scandinavia does of course have ""uniquely Scandinavian"" things too. Not to mention the fact that something being ""Scandinavian""/""Danish""/""Swedish""/""Norwegian"" doesn't even mean it's invented there, it means it's particularly pertaining to the respective region. 

And sure you can argue those are just ""little adjustments"" (they're not) and that that's the whole point of the video, but they're factually incorrect regardless. And if you insist for example danishes is merely a variant of the same pastry Austrians had, then surely it's also factually incorrect to call it Austrian considering they in turn took the technique from abroad and ""adjusted it a little"".

What are my political ideals?

&gt;If you had a logical argument against the popular vote being a better, more democratic reflection of the actual will of the people of this country, you'd make it. 

I literally have been in this thread all day. Where ya been? EC Vote allocation based on popular vote *by State*. It keeps the Democracy and preserves the Federalism. 

What's your issue with it?

&gt;But you aren't making it, because you can't.  Because there isn't one.  

I already have twice in this thread, not counting this reply.

&gt;And the only reason you won't admit that is because it means having to face a conclusion you don't want to face, no matter how well it matches reality.  

What does this shade even mean?

&gt;No shit the popular vote doesn't elect the president.  That's a thing that anyone who isn't a pedant calls ""not the point that was obviously trying to be made"".  

That - is literally what we have been talking about all day. No need for incivility, again, BTW.

Because Afghanistan wasn't a war that was as justified, or long term, or intense as WW2. The World Wars are beyond comparison to other wars just because of the scale and intensity. Hopefully the world will never have to experience that sort of violence ever again. 

Propaganda should not be enough to strip you of basic human decency. For propaganda to work on someone so well they have to be willing to accept the message it delivers and usually that means they're leaning that way anyway. And considering the Nazi regime only began in 1933, that means the people who were born into that regime were only 12 by its collapse, so I don't think they had much sway politically anyhow. The adult German population however wilfully bought into the manipulation be wise they wanted someone to blame for the first world war, and to blame and attempt to punish everyone but themselves was the choice they made. 

I never once said the entire German population should be executed. Instead, I said that civilian casualties were an unavoidable evil and that it was better that 1000 of 'them' died, than 1000 of 'us'.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin\_of\_the\_Albanians#Genetic\_studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_Albanians#Genetic_studies) 

&gt;**The three haplogroups most strongly associated with Albanian people are E-V13, R1b and J-M172. E-V13 and J2-M12 (the parent clade of J-M172) are considered by Cruciani et al to both indicate a particular ""range expansion in the** ***Bronze Age of southeastern Europe*****""**, having experienced considerable in situ population growth\[8\] after having being introduced in an earlier period with the spread of the Neolithic\[130\] into Europe. **R1b, meanwhile, has been associated with the spread of Indo-European languages in Europe.\[**131\] Within the Balkans, all three have a local peak in Kosovo, and are overall **more common among Albanians, Greeks and Vlachs than South Slavs** (albeit with some representation among Macedonians and Bulgarians).   
&gt;  
&gt;**Another study of old Balkan populations and their genetic affinities with current European populations was done in 2004, based on mitochondrial DNA on the skeletal remains of some old Thracian populations from SE of Romania, dating from the Bronze and Iron Age.\[146\] This study was during excavations of some human fossil bones of 20 individuals dating about 3200–4100 years, from the Bronze Age, belonging to some cultures such as Tei, Monteoru and Noua were found in graves from some necropoles SE of Romania, namely in Zimnicea, Smeeni, Candesti, Cioinagi-Balintesti, Gradistea-Coslogeni and Sultana-Malu Rosu; and the human fossil bones and teeth of 27 individuals from the early Iron Age, dating from the 10th to 7th centuries BC from the Hallstatt Era (the Babadag culture), were found extremely SE of Romania near the Black Sea coast, in some settlements from Dobruja, namely: Jurilovca, Satu Nou, Babadag, Niculitel and Enisala-Palanca.\[146\] After comparing this material with the present-day European population, the authors concluded:**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Computing the frequency of common point mutations of the present-day European population with the Thracian population has resulted that the Italian (7.9%), the Albanian (6.3%) and the Greek (5.8%) have shown a bias of closer \[mtDna\] genetic kinship with the Thracian individuals than the Romanian and Bulgarian individuals (only 4.2%).\[146\]**

The Dresden justification is something we need to detach ourselves emotionally to answer correctly. When Nazi Germany was on the retreat on all of its fronts and was in the last days of the war. Was it absolutely justified to bomb the one city where a big proportion of refugees were running to? There was no way the bombing of Dresden had any effect on the war as it was all but over anyway.

A favourite trick of the Russians used to be alerting Serbian forces when US and UK helicopters would be flying over an active combat zone, so it could ""accidentally"" be shot down, ideally directly above a hospital or other civilian area. It was a gruesome violent conflict that cost the West more lives than the invasion of Iraq.

Eventually NATO got bored, pulled out and bombed Yugoslavia into submission, killing around 1000 military leaders and other personnel before they got the idea Russia wasn't going to come save them (which it wouldn't have anyway even in Soviet times).

To stop mass nuclear armament in the east,the only solution would be for the US to move these nukes to less advanced armies of the East, and would mean a crash course in nuclear use by these armies which are not as advanced as their western counterparts.

3245,"Because it‘s exactly planned this way by the German government and the economic model that was set after the recession.
And Germany increased all budgets consistently over the last few years and again for 2020.
Additionally all export economies had a reduced growth this year including countries like South Korea.
The US-China trade war and Brexit directly effect Germany.

If you actually compare growth and deficit rates, the UK is in a very bad position compared to Germany and most of the UK‘s growth is built on deficit.

As an example look at 2018:
UK grew 1.4% with a deficit of -1.5%.
In 2019 it‘s even worse:
UK had 1.2% growth and -1.9% deficit.
And you‘re already at a high 86% GDP debt ratio.

2018:
Germany had 1.5% growth and an additional surplus of +1.87%.
2019:
Growth was a low 0.6% with an additional surplus of +0.6%.
And the GDP to debt ratio is at 62%, which is 20% lower than in 2010 and back on the levels of 2002.

Germany was running the last ten years on 4.0-1.5% growth with an additional surplus of over 1-2%.
We have every 10 years at least 1-2 years of down turn, so this isn‘t concerning at all, especially with it being mostly driven from weakened domestic markets of China, US, and the UK.

Germany has very little to worry about economically and can invest hundreds of billions if needed without causing economic issues, see the military budget that got increased by 5 billion and the recent 79 billion investment in rail infrastructure.

And the local economy is also barely effect with way more jobs than people.
Many of the largest Germany companies are also not publicly traded and have complete different investment structure to most UK companies, so they are also functioning very different and have different priorities.",,/r/europe/comments/f3pw2f/german_economy_stagnates_with_no_growth_in_last/fhm85ke/,ACatWithAThumb,1581709543

Where's the separation of powers?  The UK's democracy is in crisis, and the US and EU must take action!

In the US, the Supreme Court is appointed by the President, and approved by the Senate.  So any time the President has a simple majority in the Senate, he can install whoever he wants.  And technically, he can add as many judges as he wants (""pack the Supreme Court"") until there is a majority to his liking.  The left/right political balance of the Supreme Court has huge effect on the country; for example, gay marriage would not be allowed in most of the country, if not for the Supreme Court decision on the subject.

3319,"&gt; refugees are more likely to suffer from PTSD

So? This is reason to be careful about the admission of huge numbers of refugees, not to become lenient about the negative consequences of admitting them.

&gt;immigrants of certain demographics tend to be poorer than the average

This is a very handy line.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/nyregion/asians-overlooked-specialized-schools.html

In NYC (and *many* small to medium sized cities across the US), Asian origin persons are **the poorest**, by far. Yeah, yeah, we have lots of high performing Asian origin and immigrant Asian persons here - these are not them, by a long shot.

And yet, whaddya know - - as a group, indistinguishably low crime rates. 


Vietnamese immigrants/illegal aliens in European countries have low crime rates too - lots of poverty.

It has nothing to do with poverty and everything to do with the inclination to crime, which is hugely multifactorial, but ultimately, measurably different and reason not to admit people prone to violence.


&gt;normal bias of police against certain demographics

Is the bias unjustified? 

You just listed several factors: 

1) greater opportunity to commit process crimes 

2) PTSD (this is dubious to me) motivated criminality

3) Poverty (this is simply wrong imho) motivated criminality 

that can result in a much higher crime rate than the norm among foreign origin persons who are immigrants/refugees

3534,"Yup, that is correct. It (in theory) empowers the local populaces, while still keeping the proportional side (more or less; I can definitely agree that it can be biased against either of these goals). A 'party list', like from your latter example, would be extremely unpopular, both due to it being used during the communist era and because it would strip the illusion that the reps are being elected by the voters, and not by a party.  

For the curious, here's roughly how the process goes for Sejm elections (as I've seen a lot of myths and misconceptions about it):  
1) The voter casts their vote on a party, while marking their preferred representative from it (it is NOT a vote directly for a candidate); this is why a ballot with more than one vote for the same list is valid;  
2) The local commissions count their results and send them to their district commissions, these sum these up and send the results to the National Electoral Commission (PKW);  
3) The PKW sums up the votes and announces which committees passed the 5%/8% threshold nationally (not locally);  
4) The district commissions (NOT the PKW) splits the votes between the committees (NOT the candidates) using D'Hondt;  
5) Once that's done, the districts grant the mandates to *x* top-scoring candidates of every list (x = the amount of mandates they receive).
  

The issues I mentioned in the first paragraph? Well, the bias towards giving big parties more power I already covered with examples\*; for the other side: completely theoretically, assume I am running** a local campaign. The election is a total landslide, and I receive 99% of all 280k votes - well, tough luck, I need 923 536 votes to pass the 5% limit, which is almost twice the **total** amount of voters in my district.

(\*) ironically, the only committee exempt from the threshold - German Minority - is the most proportionally represented in the current Sejm, with 0,17% of votes and 0,22% mandates  
(**) not by myself, as not only at least 35% of my list has to belong to either sex, but also because I can't run a list with less candidates than there are mandates - understandable, but irrelevant for the example",Lower Silesia (Poland),/r/europe/comments/f3igox/polish_mp_joanna_lichocka_showing_a_middle_finger/fhkoj7c/,Nahcep,1581688206

No? I never even claimed there was a correlation either. This is a strawman.

In fact, your data here proves my point:

Sweden: 20 ct (40%)

The second and third most nuclearized countries in your list also boast average-to-low electricity prices.

Its nice to have a feel good position because ""their story"" and whatnot. But thats all there is to it. If recognition of that annexaction is something that brings us net benefit, then there isnt any practical reason not to do it. Sahrawis are bedoins mostly already living under Moroccan rule their entire life, with Moroccan IDs and whatnot and couple dozen thousand living in Algeria which could have given them opportunity to receive citizenship and move for better life and work to Algiers, and its a giant mystery why it didnt.

3900,"Nobody said states (political entities) did not exist before or that they were not multi-ethnic. The point is, that outside of some exceptions like maybe the swiss coalitions, these states were not organised and legitimised around nationalities, but feudal relations and loyalti.

If you would ask people of the time who they were they would not answer French, German or Polish like today, because it was largely not a part of their identity, or even if it was, was mostly a geographical or lingual identity (I am from the polish lands, i speak the polish tongue) not a modern conception of belonging to a common national identity.

If you would try to talk to any of the Casimirs or Boleslaws that ruled Poland during the midle ages, they would not be lile 'Yo, hello fellow polish person, how are you?'. He would ask why a commoner was trying to talk to him (possibly would say this even in latin or french), have you taken away and then go party with his fellow nobles and wife, who was likely to be from a different nationality to secure some sort of feudal holding. Most politically active individuals a. k. a. nobles would identify much more with nobles from other parts of Europe than with their own commonfolk. 

I'm not saying ethnicities or even nationalities existed, but they were largely politically irrelevant. Thats why you had things lile feudal unions forming large multiethnic commonwealths, dukes and kings from one part of Europe owning some small castle on the other part of it and states like the teutonic kingdoms in the baltic, that had a completely different ethnic group governing than the native populations. If these states were organised similarly to today they would have either quickly collapsed, or slowly assimilated into one larger nationality, which did not happen.

4134,"While this is correct, it is important to underline several points:

1) The big raid on Dresden was comprised of several sub-raids. Two forces conducting the bombing were the Royal Air Force and USAAF 8th Fleet.

2) The USAAF were concentrating on military and industrial targets that you have mentioned, while the RAF focused on firebombing civilian and cultural areas, especially during the night bombing of 13th February. The first surprise RAF raid was the one that destroyed the city and killed most civilians.

3) [Here is an general view of Dresden some time before the destruction](https://i.imgur.com/0Osigzb.jpg). I have [outlined the positions](https://i.imgur.com/iFPGQWe.png) of various logistical, industrial and military targets in the city, as well as the actual targets of the RAF raid of Feb 13th. Three sectors marked in red correspond with two waves - First wave (22:10 - 22:30) and Second wave (01:20 - 01:45). A total of about 750 Avro Lancasters took part in the raid. Bridges over Elbe were also neither targeted nor affected by the bombing.

3) The British area night bombing tactics were anything but imprecise. The RAF have perfected the technique - Pathfinder Mosquitoes delivered radio and light flares on predesignated targets,  sometime using special incendiary devices to set fire on big buildings such as the churches and city halls. These were the markings for the upcoming bomber stream, which aligned their bearings and conducted low level (sometime as low as 500m) release. Individual bombing squadrons were able to put all of their bombs into 150x600m rectangle. Below is the quote that shows what level of accuracy was attained in Dresden:

&gt;The sirens started sounding in Dresden at 21:51 (CET). Wing Commander Maurice Smith, flying in a Mosquito, gave the order to the Lancasters: ""Controller to Plate Rack Force: Come in and bomb glow of red target indicators as planned. Bomb the glow of red TIs as planned"". The first bombs were released at 22:13, the last at 22:28, the Lancasters delivering 881.1 tons of bombs, 57% high explosive, 43% incendiaries. The fan-shaped area that was bombed was 1.25 miles (2.01 km) long, and at its extreme about 1.75 miles (2.82 km) wide. The shape and total devastation of the area was created by the bombers of No. 5 Group flying over the head of the fan (Ostragehege stadium) on prearranged compass bearings and releasing their bombs at different prearranged times.

I recommend reading on British night bombing tactics, as well as *Battle Over The Reich Vol.2: The Strategic Bomber Offensive Over Germany* by Alfred Price.

4) It can be highlighted from above that the RAF attacked primarily non-industrial civilian areas. It is no surprise and no secret that this is the case - the policy and doctrine of area bombing specifically aimed at civilian targets - destroying and killing as much as possible. Arthur Harris himself openly confirms this:

&gt;The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive...should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilized life throughout Germany. ... the destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale, and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battle fronts by fear of extended and intensified bombing, are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy. **They are not by-products of attempts to hit factories**.

5) As per above, Area Bombing should never be lumped up with the Strategic bombing of the key industrial, logistical and military targets. The latter, primarily done by the USAAF (although the RAF has also done a share of it), practically demolished the Military-Industrial complex of the Nazi war machine, and was a final nail into the coffin of Wehrmacht. This included - [collapse of armament industry](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/vakhnenko/12830626/122212/122212_original.jpg) and [explosives](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/vakhnenko/12830626/120640/120640_original.jpg), destruction of [oil and rubber supply](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/vakhnenko/12830626/86268/86268_original.jpg), production [of steel](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/vakhnenko/12830626/122810/122810_original.jpg), and a [total breakdown of logistics](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/vakhnenko/12830626/87713/87713_original.jpg), that facilitated final [collapse of industrial production](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/vakhnenko/12830626/122468/122468_original.jpg). These were effective and absolutely necessary actions. However, these types of bombings were rarely affecting historical and populated areas - such as in Regensburg, Halle and other places which were extensively bombed by the USAAF, but not by RAF area bombings. Also, much of Italy was also heavily bombed, but since it was also done primarily by the USAAF and without significant area bombings, civilian and cultural losses were for the most part avoided. 

On the other hand, the direct bombings of civilian and cultural areas [had a very low effect on production and morale](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3010056?seq=1). This was true both for the Nazi bombings all the way from Spain to Britain, as well as for the Allied bombings in Europe and Japan. Had Harris and certain members of the War Cabinet not been so stubborn and vengeful, the demise of Germany could probably be hastened by re-focusing RAF effort on effective targets. In the same way, loss of World Heritage cultural fabric that affects many generations long after the war, could be almost completely avoided.",,/r/europe/comments/f3e6ya/on_this_day_75_years_ago_the_allies_began_a/fhjhm6k/,Strydwolf,1581646425

For instance the main station is to this day in the city centre so it was a valuable target, it was a major deployment hub for the eastern front. Also the Nazis were the first to bomb the crap out of cities, in the mindset of the time it was just retribution.

No, if a book is considered sacred, it cannot be changed. Do you even realise how ridiculous and absurd it is to believe that a religious person is going to change a text he considers to be sacred? I mean, I get that logic is not your strongest suit but still.

Bible is a *collection* of books written during a long period of time which were collected a loong time ago. There are many books and stories that the Churches consider canonical and non canonical and there is a consensus what is canonical and not amongst the entirety of Christianity with some minor differences and this consensus was established before even Middle Ages. And the only changes that would exist would be based on whether there were some new evidence regarding a text's history. Nobody is actually going to change an actual text he considers as sacred, to say so is just flat out stupid. And the Bible you have now is pretty much the same as it always was since it was first compiled anyway.

Now if at some point the entire community of Islam decides that some parts of Quran are fake and not true words of God, they would change it accordingly. Good luck with that though, since unlike the Bible which is simply a collection of divinely inspired texts written by quite a few authors, Quran is considered by Muslims as the same exact book Allah gave to Mohammad, it even wasn't actually written by anyone, it's literally believed to be a miracle made by Allah.

Those prices will rise along with energy prices because they're very much dependent on energy-intensive operations like crushing rock.

&gt;It's the same thing that has happened with oil: some economists were predicting peak oil, but it never happened. The reason that burning oil is a problem is not that we will exhaust the supply. In fact, the only problem with continuing to burn oil is carbon emissions.

Peak oil does happen for every oil resource. It will happen for all of them in aggregate too. The only reason it didn't happen yet are the unconventional resources, and it remains to be seen whether those are just squeezing out the remaining resources faster, or are a new resource.

If my memory is right, his wife died of cancer sometime in the early 2000s, and he committed suicide in his home not too long after, by slitting his own throat. His daughter found his body a week and a bit later.

I don't think it was the only event in his life that gave him troubles, but... it certainly had an impact. It would suck for an event like that to be such a defining feature of your life, especially as an artist. You'd never be able to escape other people's perception of it in relation to how they see you, so you'd never really be able to get fully free of it.

4248,"&gt; Capacity factor is only relevant for grid operators. It is a measure how much of the theoretical maximum capacity an installation delivers over time, not what percentage it can deliver on a grid. There is nothing that stops renewables from delivering 60%, 100%, or even 150% of the needed electricity. Of course, in the latter cases we'll need a way to convert the extra electricity to storage.

The capacity factor for solar can be as low as 0.1 and winds around 0.4 (depends entirely on the area but that’s what I think it is in my country). Capacity factor is essentially the average output/max output. So with 50/50 solar/wind generation, and assuming you want average production for the year to equal/exceed average load, you could be looking at 250% of needed electricity being produced at any moment. “Needed electricity” being the average demand, so during a sunny, windy day where load isn’t too high (a problem compounded by rooftop PV) it could go well above 250%. That’s an insane amount of storage needed.

I think it simply isn’t realistic to expect countries to be able to transition to fully renewable generation any time soon. Some countries with great geography for renewable generation probably can, although I don’t think any have yet.

The argument shouldn’t be nuclear vs renewables but nuclear vs fossil fuels. Time and time again we see claims that were entirely out of time and drastic change has to occur yet people think it’s fine to wait for a slow transition to renewable energy with no real plan to go entirely without fossil fuels. Odds are, there will still be a lot of fossil fuel plants in 30 years, and by then it’ll truly be too late to build more nuclear plants.",,/r/europe/comments/f39r2q/eu_accused_of_climate_crisis_hypocrisy_after/fhj4l49/,BigFatMoggyEejit,1581638050

Now the timings seem  to support this but it's (in my view) very difficult to tell whether the loss of the USSR as a potential mediator (and them becoming a potential occupier) or the bombs swayed Japan. I think both did but which proved decisive is up for debate. 

The goal of the Nazis was to kill. Their plan was to kill or enslave three quarters of the USSR. Nobody else, not even Stalin, wanted to do that. When the Brits went to bomb Dresden, there was a clear military purpose to this but the technology at the time meant they couldn't really only drop bombs on military targets (especially at night). 

Contrast that with what the Nazis did at, say, Leningrad. Their military doctrine dictated they needed to take the city as fast as possible and move on, but they didn't. They kept up a siege for a couple of weeks short of 900 days to starve the population. Even the British famine in India was caused by external pressure rather than internal desire to starve the population (why would you starve the people you want fighting for you against an all conquering Japan?). 

And nowhere did I even mention anything about Good vs Evil. One side being Evil does not make the other Good. It was pure evil against lesser evil.

But you go back to the XI century, and surprise, surprise, the Kievan Rus, the state that preceded Muscovy joined forces with the Holy Roman Empire to gank the Kingdom of Poland and throw Mieszko II off the throne in favour of his older half-brother.

Besides, unemployment is a concept that may be defined in many ways. Generally speaking, most countries don't even consider in the usual statistics people that have been looking for a job for a long time and can't find one (discouraged workers). Then there's the whole thing of underemployment, an umbrella that includes precarious employment and non-voluntary part-time workers. Countries like The Netherlands have a lot of these, and if we include this broader definition we have charts like this one for 2017: https://insights.abnamro.nl/app/uploads/2017/12/171204-SI3.jpg, which paint an awful picture.

The thing - besides the statistics, *having a job* means much more than *doing work*. Having a job allows you to be a ""normal"" citizen, with duties and rights, and visibility! If you don't have a job, you're almost invisible. More so, if you don't have a *standard job*, you're invisible. Mini jobs in Germany, non-voluntary part-timers, zero-hours contracts in the UK, and the gig economy overall have all brought upon more precariousness for workers.

Left Member in strong words about the campaign against LGBT people

""Recently, Polish self-governments have started to vote that they are LGBT-free zones. Fortunately, this is not a universally binding law, but subsequent local governments are deciding to pass such resolutions locally. (...) Nobody expects the Polish right will be an avant-garde of progress , **but somewhere deeply I believe** (...) **that you will stop the spiral of hatred** ""- said Leftist MP Paulina Matysiak in the Sejm.

Left-wing MP Paulina Matysiak spoke in the Sejm about LGBT-free zone resolutions and Local Government Charter on Family Rights undertaken by local governments throughout Poland. **Currently, over 10 million live in regions that define themselves as LGBT free zones**. Polish women and Poles.

In very strong words, the deputy appealed to right-wing politicians and politicians to stop the spiral of hatred**. She stated that the government had no idea to deal with problems such as provincial exclusion or pedophilia in the church, thus creating an enemy - LGBT people - to wash his hands of responsibility.**

""Recently, Polish local governments have begun to vote that they are LGBT-free zones. Fortunately, **this is not a universally binding law, but subsequent local governments are deciding to adopt such resolutions locally**. In one form or another they cover almost all of south-eastern Poland and this zone is expanding. **Currently, about 1/3 of Poles and Poles, over 10 million of us live in them ""- said Matysiak.**

&amp;#x200B;

""These resolutions are not only ridiculing the law, **and hence the whole state**, but also a manifestation of something much worse. **Saturating the law with radical ideology, writing laws dictated by religious fanatics and binding secular law with religious dogmas is a civilization regress. nonsense** ""- said the MP -"" Polish families are threatened by a series of **droughts, the shrinking of state institutions in the province is threatening. Polish families are threatened by the collapse of public services or public transport**, which excludes and marginalizes millions of people in our country. However, you do not have to deal with these problems idea. **You can't find money in the budget and you don't focus on strength and resources. ""**

Matysiak further stated that the right wing creates an enemy figure that serves to justify its failures: ""Instead of facing real threats, you create an enemy figure, **point your finger at a gay, lesbian, young boy humiliated in his school, show two men holding hands and say: ""this is your enemy""**, and behind your finger like on orders from the pulpit and television sets all over Poland is pouring mean vagabond. *Someone ridiculed you in the international arena - LGBT fault. You can not do anything not to overturn for your own legs - LGBT faults. You don't have the courage to loudly and clearly condemn pedophilia in the Catholic church - LGBT faults. Electricity prices rise - LGBT faults. But LGBT is not an ideology, it's flesh and blood. ""*

&amp;#x200B;

""What you do is the first step to dehumanize millions of our fellow citizens**. This is the moment when through your propaganda tubes you run a stitch day and night to stop seeing ordinary people in LGBT and see ideolog**y, because ideology can be kicked, it can be spat, with ideology you can fight, you can throw a stone as the ideology goes with the flag, you can catch such an ideology and kick like a dog, put your head in the toilet and drain the water, because it's ideology, not a man ""- she said.

2. US and Russia are nothing alike, even a cursory knowledge of history would make that clear.

3. Please treat people better: just because someone disagrees with you it does not mean that they work for CIA.

4359,"And below the answer you deserve:


1/ You are the alternative history provider

2/
&gt;Screaming your own irrelevance isn’t usually something someone takes pride in

France was a worldpower at that time. France wasn't irrelevant, it's just American are hilariously clueless and notoriously stupid when it comes to geography. It was true back then, it is still true today.

3/
&gt;And the French people threw flowers at them as they went.

Your very words. Where are the flowers? In your imagination where you invent your own history. In 1945, 57% of the French thought that USSR was the biggest contributor to the French liberation, USA was 20%, so no, you weren't viewed like the Hero you imagine you were.



4/
&gt;So if they didn’t come France would be under nazi Germany. 

Nah, that's why delusional American like to imagine. The Russian would have beaten the German and France would have freed itself.

5/
&gt;Why would they treat France any differently than they treated East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Albania and Yugoslavia. They wouldn’t. 

Already replied to that if you knew how to read. France isn't the others small countries you named and France was very far from Russia. Simple. Also for proof, the yanks were kicked out and France did not turn into a Soviet state. That is just the proof you need.


6/ 
&gt;No the French goal was to wait to be liberated by the Americans

Again your imagination working overtime. USA was stuck for a long time into debating if they should keep on segregating black or literaly join hitler.

7/
&gt;Almost everyone who is invaded

Uk and Italy were not invaded, but OK, another of your imaginary history chapter. The others have country who looks like shit now. Like I said, if you have better alternative and you aren't half a moron, you don't go all out in your own house. I don't expect you to have the capacity to follow here.

8/
&gt;The UK could not handle Germany alone. 

You don't even have basic language skill and can't comprehend simple situation. I said, once Russia and Germany exhausted each other, UK would have been enough to safe guard French safety along side French troops. In fact, this is exactly what happened. France kicked out the yanks and wasn't invaded by the soviet union. Proof that you were not requiered.

9/
&gt;You asked the Americans to leave and they chose to do so

We kicked them out. They didn't want to leave. They got salty. But what could have they have done? Make another D-DAY, this time to invade France, and have 100% chance to turn France toward the USSR? The reality is that you had no choice but to fuck off if you did not want to lose Europe to Russian.

That’s a bit redundant; it’s equivalent to decrying the bombing of Hiroshima because the bomb was dropped near the city-center rather than a dockyard: civilian casualties were inevitable irrespective of whichever landmark the bomber chose to target. Strategic bombing as a concept was only just beginning to mature during WW2, and the technological limitations of the time meant that only a fraction of bombs could be expected to land near the target. The vulnerability of heavy bombers to flak also necessitated that bombing be conducted from high altitudes, further compromising the accuracy of Allied bombers. Given the limitations confronted by the Allies, dropping more bombs from more planes was the only real way to have made strategic bombing effective. It’s unfortunate that civilians in places like Dresden were caught in the crossfire, but those casualties were inevitable irrespective of what the Allies did or didn’t do. There was, after all, a war going on, and the industries of the Axis were fair game.

If developing new tank to produce 600 or in long run 800 units is not viable, then you'll be surprised how few new European tanks that are under development by Nexter-KMW will sell. 

Also you have no idea what you are talking about, whole production run of Leclerc is not even 800 units, + some recovery vehicles based on it, but even then it is +/- 850 units. And approximately half of them are French, rest was exported to UAE. Germany will have +/- 580 Leopards 2 after all Leo 2A7 will be delivered, yet they designing new tank together for what is roughly 1000 tank now, but France was talking about limiting number of their tanks. Add some European sales and what might be achieved is 1500-2000 units production run. 

Also neither Nexter, nor KMW are interested in selling license for currently produced tanks, so only viable solution for 600-800 units run is to either design new tank, or cooperate with partner who is willing to provide technology. This is not Germany, France, or USA, Italy might be but then Ariete is very low production (200 units, 1/3 or 1/4 of what Poland need in long run), and needs upgrades itself. Turkey still struggles with Altay, power-pack isn't ready, because nobody wanted to sell license to them. 

TL:DR; Nobody will sell license, except Korea, and for 600-800 units it would be madness to buy off the shelf product, and have no control over production/service/upgrades. Also tanks don't sell in thousands anymore, unless country of origin buys them in thousands, otherwise it usually is 50-100 units here and there.",,/r/europe/comments/f367ov/what_a_world_polish_tanks_advancing_through_a/fhi0p95/,0mn0mn0mn0mn0m,1581615514

We don't have another half-century of leeway to spare to go ""oh well, that was a mistake"" and then take our time implementing solutions that were already on the table from the get go. If renewables don't work out, then we'll have wasted decades going all in on an energy transition program that doesn't reduce our CO2 emissions satisfactorily, and we won't be able to contain climate change to a safe level. I'm sure you're aware of the consequences that could have. 

If renewables don't work out, the people after us will be stuck with a globally fucked up climate, entire nations submerged underwater, droughts and plummeting farming yields causing massive refugee waves and wars, ecosystems will collapse on a global scale, leading to the extinction of species which took *millions of years* to evolve into what they are now.

If some nuclear storage sites fail, some of the low-density areas around their location will need to be evacuated, some people will be displaced. There won't be much of a global impact, and the contaminated area won't lead to the extinction of entire species. In fact, current containment zones, like around Chernobyl or Fukushima, still contain a decent amount of animals and plants, which paradoxically seem to be somewhat thriving thanks to the lack of human presence. After a few centuries to a millennium, the worst isotopes will begin disappearing and humans will be able to populate the area once again. It will take *much* longer for submerged areas to recede back into arable land in the event of catastrophic climate change.

We're way past the time for experiments. I'm not willing to gamble on the development of technologies that may not lead to a sufficient reduction in emissions when so much is at stake and *satisfactory technology is already available*.

4531,"&gt; are these two (RS and BiH), seemingly practically separate political entities one country?

Well kinda. The point of Dayton agreement was to stop a war, and create two practically separate and independent entities within the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

And it did succeed in doing that, it stopped the war and entities were created with their own jurisdictions.

The problems however, arise now, some 25 years after the war was ended, since the country of Bosnia was left dysfunctional. Why? Well because the goal of Dayton was never to be the final and last agreement between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, but rather the first out of many. But in the real world, those three sides have different interests and all want country to go in different directions, and therefore cannot agree on anything, putting a country in a halt, rather than moving forward.

The main problem is that Bosniaks, who, due to demographics are now at 50.1% (a.k.a a majority), want to create ""a civil and unitary Bosnia"", which other two ethnic groups see as a project to dominate them and create a country where Bosniaks (since they are a majority) would decide on everything (from foreign policy to domestic).

The other groups, and primarily Serbs, want the exact opposite from a unitary state, they want further federalization, where Bosnia would just be a group of practically two completely independent states, where almost no jurisdiction would be on the level of Bosnia as a whole.

Now obviously these separating interests meant that country was in a standstill.

But that all changes from year to year, when Bosniaks, with some foreign support, manage to push their changes even without the support of other two groups. This particular one is about the constitutional court where members are 2 Serbs, 2 Croats, 2 Bosniaks and 3 non-citizens foreign people. 

Dodik's stance is that those 3 are simply Bosniak aligned meaning that Bosniaks have complete control of country and its laws since 5&gt;4. Meaning that they can declare any law from RS unconstitutional if they want, and also impose any law on RS simply by switching jurisdiction to a Bosnia as a whole.

The other problem is also the office of [High representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_for_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina) a foreign person with significant powers, which, again according to Dodik is aligned with the Bosniak side.

&gt; Who wants to stay together?

Bosniaks obviously, since they want a unitary state. Serbs definitely do not want to stay together, while Croats are somewhat in-between and would most of all prefer their own entity instead of sharing one with Bosniaks.

International community (EU+USA) would, for the most part, like to see Bosnia together since they dont want further Balkanization since Yugoslavia is now 6 countries + Kosovo. Although it is up for debate how much Kosovo issue makes all this more complicated (support one self-determination project, and oppose the other).

Other international actors do not care, with the exception of Russia, which is aligned with Serbs and Turkey which is aligned with Bosniaks.

The 2bn in this example plus the interest of 1% still have to be paid back in full. Your government can now switch over time from bonds with high interest rates to lower interest rates.

Several different techniques were tried, including Knickebein, X-Gerät and Y-Gerät (Wotan). These provided impressive accuracy—British post-raid analysis showed that the vast majority of the bombs dropped could be placed within 100 yards (91 m) of the midline of the beam, spread along it a few hundred yards around the target point, even in pitch-dark conditions at a range of several hundred miles.

I completely disagree. We're moving toward a post-oil world in the United States. 

Honestly, I work in transportation, which is highly reliant on oil, and I think we'll see a move toward electric direct-drive when automation becomes more important in the next decade. 

It is kind of like the shift from a manufacturing to service economy. As the United States moves away from oil reliance, we'll also orient away from the Middle East. The question is will we (or Europe) be willing to accept China taking control of that part of the world? Who makes a better business partner, the Americans or Chinese?

They seem too eager to do business with Russians even at our expense. Also, German talking heads are much too patronizing for me to actually like them.

Whites will be a minority in France soon too if nothing changes. That’s the whole point.

Fascists in Poland are on the rise (anti LGBT towns, anti LGBT violence, anti muslim and xenophobic violence). Of course Poland is a civilized EU country, so we don’t have Hutu killing Tutsi violence here, but it is clear: fascists are on the rise.

Pis is not a „moderate” party, not even close. Hard right wing, with extremely hard catholic stance. And they are fascist in couple of crucial ways:
- the state is all important and an individual has no value against the state
- marriage of state and big business (they actively buy back big companies, they want to control economy as much as possible)
- use of prosecutor office, special forces in the internal political fight
- more but I dont have time now

Oh, and your „analysis” of Italian and German fascism is sooo pathetic. These were right wing totalitarian movements. Just look at their cooperation with big business.

- all phone numbers start with 06 or when dialing in-country calls, or 0036 or if dialing a hungarian number from abroad, +36 also works for mobiles for both cases
- then comes the double-digit number of the provider, for example 20 is Telenor, 30 is T-Mobile, 70 is Vodafone. Landlines have a district number instead of the provider number, so for example 42 in this slot means the landline is a certain region of the country
- then comes the actual phone number, 6 digits for landline and 7 digits for mobile.

So a full phone number looks like this:
- landline: 06 42 123 456 from Hungary or 0036 42 123 456 from abroad

You can clearly see that coal usage jumped in 2011, and it didn't drop below 2010 levels until 2017. That's 6 years of increases that could have been avoided.

In fact, so far Germany has reduced nuclear production by 60TWh/year. That's 40% of their current yearly coal usage. So in other words: If the German government *actually* cared about reducing CO2 quickly then they would have kept nuclear plants going and reduced coal usage by 40% ... and once renewables could take the place of nuclear *only then* should they close the nuclear plants.

Also, price comparisons with renewables pretty much never account for the latter's intermittency. It's doesn't really make sense to compare the cost of 1kWh of nuclear and 1kW of renewable energy in a vacuum. If you want *actually* low levels of gCO2/kWh (ie not use a majority of gas for energy), the higher the share of renewables in your energy mix, the higher the cost associated with intermittency (either through fleet oversizing or storage solutions), that can get pricy pretty fast as well.",,/r/europe/comments/f2wb70/eu_accused_of_climate_crisis_hypocrisy_after/fhguk38/,Perett2822120,1581579776

&gt;How is living in Vietnam

It depends if you are the ruling class (mostly Communist Party members their families, relatives and 'friends') or working class. If you are the ruling class, you drive BMW, Mercedes Benz, Lamborghini, or tractors over the poor farmers you rob lands from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btHlcd8SVKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btHlcd8SVKM), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csZ-7CuUrn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csZ-7CuUrn4). **The land-robbing continue to these days after 45 years, and getting worse, as the victims now include not just the wealthy but also poor farmers and even Communist veterans themselves. Not only that, they kill anyone who resists the land robbing,** as typified by the recent case in Dong Tam village (near Hanoi) in which they killed a 84-year-old man in wheelchair to rob lands for Viettel, more than 80% owned by PRC's Huawei, to finance its debt. The victim, **Mr. Le Dinh Kinh**, a well-respected village elder and land scholar in Dong Tam who resisted land robbing by the corrupt Vietnamese Communists. He already escaped an assassination attempt by them in 2017 with a broken leg, but recently succumbed to **their ambush at 4 AM in his own home**. They brutally tortured him before killing him. His carcass was returned a day later, full of bullet holes, 2 to the head, 1 to the heart, and 1 to the remained functional left leg of his, almost detached from his body at the knee. **All the internal organs were harvested from the corpse without permission from any members of his family (does this sound familiar?)**. They then forced his wife Mrs. Du Thi Thanh to falsely admit that her husband was killed at a location 3 km (and not at his home) when he was trying to attack the police with a grenade. When she refused to lie, they brutally tortured her.

On the other hand, if you are the working class, other than having your lands robbed and homes destroyed, you work in factories, sell yourself to foreign men if you are young:

Women living in poverty: **150,000 Vietnamese women had to sell themselves EVERY YEAR as brides to Korean and Chinese men from abroad to escape abject poverty. A staggering 300,000 Vietnamese brides married in this fashion between 2008-2010**, for example. Many also suffered and even died as a result of extended abuses by their husbands or disguised human traffickers, pimps, and organ harvesters [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HPR7bxnqCw](https://archive.is/o/YI5Py/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HPR7bxnqCw)

If you are working class, you might have to travel abroad for work, either legally or otherwise.

'Vietnam sent 134,751 workers to work abroad in 2017, including 53,340 female workers (accounting for 39.6%), according to the latest data from the Department of Overseas Labour (DOLAB) under the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA).

The figure is exceeding by 28.3% of the annual plan set for 2017 and accounts for 106.7% of the 2016 figure.2017 is the fourth consecutive year the number of Vietnamese overseas workers exceeded the 100,000 benchmark per year.The statistics show that last year, the Japanese market witnessed a remarkable growth, receiving 54,504 Vietnamese labourers (including 24,502 female workers).

But you're right about the rest. The money isn't going where it should be going. That is undeniably true. But being a tax haven brings us more shame than it actually does any good for the common man.

And that common man is, by the way, getting more and more tired of being called a tax haven. Opposition to being one is growing by the day. Things are changing already and it's only a matter of time before we stop being one.

&gt;Defend the border, with force if necessary. As nations have done for all of history.

Except they literally didn't. Protected borders and passports are kind of new concepts applied in the last 100 - 150 - 200 years of our history (depending of the area).

**They are now protecting the borders with force, if necessary. This no joke, they are currently doing this. All of the countries are.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Set targets for legal immigration to 0  
&gt;  
&gt; If someone sneaks through, send them home when you find out. Under no circumstances should they, or their children, or their grandchildren ever be made French citizens. Under no circumstances should they be eligible for state aid of any kind. If someone is found to have employed them, that person is sent to prison. 

Listen, they are human beings that need to eat, need shelter, etc.. If you think more then 2 minutes about what you said you realize that putting something like this into practice will lead all immigrants to a life of crime. They won't even risk trying to integrate because that means deportion, all of them will just steal, rob, etc.. in order to survive. And they won't say ""Let's go somewhere else"" because in the end at least in France they have someone to rob.

Please understand people risk their lives to get in France. That's how desperate they are.

Actually the better measure is to always give them access to fields that need workers. I'd actually agree with lowering  the requirements and fast track anyone that has found a job into a temporary residence paper. Calais and all that happens exactly because people are having a hard time accessing the job market.

Btw, non-EU citizens tend not to be eligible for state aid if they haven't first worked somewhere. They are just a few state programs and for the others there are just non-profit humanitarian organizations.

5176,"It's fairly standard practice as part of an internal arbitration agreement in most organizations. If everyone involved believed the matter was settled fairly then that's that. No need to get anyone else involved. No need to bring it up to the media and cause a stir. It's dealt with in a way everyone agreed to. Now when it comes to criminal action like sexual assault that shouldn't happen because it should be taken up with the cops, not the university. 

The examples of sexual assault in the article the cops said there wasn't enough evidence so they couldn't do anything so as far as the law is concerned there was no sexual assault. The university can't do much more than accept that. If they tried to claim there was sexual assault they could be sued since the cops said there wasn't enough proof. And arguably if the victims claimed to be sexually assaulted it'd fall under defamation since legally it didn't happen. The most the college can really do is offer counseling. They can say the believe the victim, but they can only take very limited action because legally nothing happened. 

In the third example they literally just handed her 5,000 to shut up and disappear and she took it. If you don't want an NDA don't take the hush money. Go to the authorities instead. Sue them in court for cutting you off because you raised safety concerns. Don't sign the sheet of paper telling you to shut up and take their check.

Overall the examples in the article are pretty poor for clarifying what the actual issue is. I'm against superfluous NDAs but I don't think they are the issue in the examples. In two of them no crime officially happened so the university should never have settled in the first place and in the third one she took hush money without any promise of circumstances improving. If she cared she never should have taken the money.

There is clearly an issue where colleges will take no action unless an NDA is signing which is wrong, but it's easy to avoid the NDA if you aren't satisfied with how the college handled the situation.",,/r/europe/comments/f2tcbi/sexual_assault_claims_gagged_by_uk_universities/fhgfgnq/,demonica123,1581565762

&gt; “We will stay here with whites who appreciate that blacks must own all strategic things in the economy – land, banks, mines,” he said.

It's we're and you're. I don't mean to be a dick but you should know this as an American, it's basic English. Does it matter how long they were? Both were regressive. With globalization and modern technology the Saudis were able to reach far and wide in a relatively short time span. The Saudis can easily print a million religious texts and ship them all over the world. That was not possible 600 years ago.

The Abbasid Caliphate and the Islamic Golden Age were declining long before the Sacking of Baghdad. The sacking was simply the final nail in the coffin.

&gt;The unliberal ideas of wahhabism stem from this great loss. They are not independent.

They're connected but independent events. You can't blame everything on the Mongols. What the Mongols did, the Ottomans did, the Soviets, the British, and the Americans, all independently had an impact on the Islamic world. Otherwise you can play that game forever and blame the Abbasids for their own demise because they didn't submit to the Mongols.

I never said it was, and the Saudi propaganda campaign influenced much more than just the middle east. It influenced Muslims all over the world. It still does to this day, who knows how long that'll continue.

A clear example would be Turkey. The flow of money from outside mostly Eu was growing every year until just recently. Maybe statistically more people are above the poverty line than ever before but everything else went to shit. One of the main reason is of course the incoming money was never to improve important institutions but as a way of a select few getting rich very fast. Most of these new rich people were very much alligned with the ruling government. Of course the riches wasn't coming from STEM or anything beneficial but mostly  from the construction sector.

I said religion, not Islam in particular. In USA, religion is very important and is still a pain in the ass for social rights. Sure, you don't burn witches anymore, but religion still makes a lot of American people homophobic and against women rights like abortion.

My personal impression from reading large chunks of the book is that there is technically no margin whatsoever for malleability. Thankfully, out there most muslims around us are technically *heretics,* as they do not strictly follow what's in the Quran - and thus, are ""bad believers"".

Feel free to contradict me, but at the very least make sure you read surahs Al-Fatihah and Al-Baqarah beforehand (first one takes 2 minutes reading, second one less than an hour).

Free trade agreements are usually on the bases of commonality, in those cases they benefit both.  
But having a free trade agreement with a country lacking basic labor rights might undercut European workers.  
This actually happened with the South Korean FTA as well, so the EU even threatened South Korea as they are not properly abiding to the agreement.  
Under the agreement Korea was supposed to adapt international labor protections for Korean workers, but their government still hasn't implemented it.

It's hard to talk about Islam, because Islam is a religion and a political ideology at the same time and secularism didn't happen. The Koran is the Holy Bible and Karl Marx's Capital at the same time. Once the religion has enough followers, the Islamic Church will become Islamic Party, Islamic mosque will become Islamic party headquarters and the followers will become soldiers. 

Islam needs to be rebuilt to fit our western values, it needa to be securalized and it needs to be rid of all of its political aspects.

Maybe start out from sufiist school of thought, from the purely spiritual aspects of Islam and build it up to a civilized version that omits sexism, homophobia and violence and is compatible with western humanism. Make it an european school of Islam and make it the only Islamic religion that's tolerated.

Feminism, the education of females and their changing role has contributed more than anything else to the fall in the birth rate.

The role of women has become that of the male. men and women are in competition with each other. In societies with high birth rates men and women are not in competition for jobs and education.

Society has changed the role of the female but not the role of the male and here in lies the problem. No man will give up a career to look after the children if he is going to get screwed over if they divorce. 95% of all child contested cases goes to the mother. It is rare for a woman to pay maintenance to a man. The court rarely makes a mother pay.

Until men are awarded custody in divorces as equally as women then men will shy away from looking after children.

5496,"What do you mean ""were there any""? Political pluralism dictates that you can create a new party any time you want. Just gather the needed support. You can't? That's because the population supports the established parties. That's not a problem of the system, it's a problem of the stupidity of the voters. 

And, no, there's no serious problem in Western countries. That problem exists only in countries with two party systems and FPTP voting. Most don't have that, so most countries constantly see the rise and fall of parties. 

Again, what you're arguing is that democracy fundamentally doesn't work. And you're right. It doesn't work as intended, because it's intended for the people to constantly be well informed, politically and civically active, and well educated. And they're not. They don't give a shit until it hits them in their bank account. They're stupid. They're naïve. And democracy suffers. But it still is the best system we have. The UK and US simply showcase the result of a combination of a worse voting system with an uneducated and easily manipulated population. It's close to how capitalism doesn't work as intended because of the innate psychology of the consumers. Classical capitalism theory states that the consumers should be jumping from company to company based on which one is currently putting out the best and most cost effective product. And companies should have competition amongst themselves which would lower the cost for consumers. But that's not what we're seeing. People still buy incredibly overpriced Apple products, even though it's economically idiotic, because of their irrational biases.

People like to think that salafism is ideologically synonymous with the use of terror but it is in fact intellectually not that different from fundamentalist, literal(ist) readers of the bible. The terror tactics are more about power imbalances and social upheaval in the middle east. Anti-religious groups, nationalists or other sectarian groups use them as well.

I don't have a collective agreement in my profession and location (mostly because we don't need one), but my company gives a paid pause in the morning and one in the afternoon, while other companies allow to go and get coffee whenever, and companies don't stomp on employees chatting a few mins while passing by.

But companies that allow to go outside to smoke without stamping out, have employees who lose like an hour a day because maybe they also have some rule like no smoking on campus and so they go for 15 min treks every time. It impacts the bottom line and it's not reasonable in regard to non-smokers.

That's if you're paid by the clocked hours like I am.

Other people might just have to get the work done and have no hours they have to be at work, in which case they might as well take breaks if they want to I guess, but then there's no overtime either.

Okay I’m going to reply to this just to show how dumb you are. First of all, “actual scientific matters” there’s nothing scientific going on here this is history. And alternative history at that because you keep bringing up if the Americans did not come at all. You could have said it was actual mathematical matters and been just as incorrect. Work on your English. 

&gt; American didn't know where the fuck was France. They still freaking don't.

Screaming your own irrelevance isn’t usually something someone takes pride in. Again your grammar is horrible. You need to work on your English. 

&gt; A couple of flowers were thrown. You romantize &amp; Imagine history and you look like an idiot when you do. 

“A couple of flowers were thrown.”[parades in the streets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_of_Paris)  as the Americans rolled on through, you painting something differently than it was is you reimagining history. Liberators of your country that was trashed in weeks. 

&gt; You don't know what the fuck Staline would have done. Like you said, they may not even have beat the German without help.

Okay let’s pretend russia beats germany without any help. Why would they treat France any differently than they treated East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Albania and Yugoslavia. They wouldn’t. Do you know where the Soviet bloc line is? It’s where the US met the soviets and held that line. 

&gt; It's just that you're clueless when it comes to war. Who the fuck goes all out in it's own house? 

Almost everyone who is invaded. Easy WW2 examples germany, UK, Russia, Poland, Italy. France was pathetic in WW2. 

&gt; The goal isn't to liberate a pile of ashes.

No the French goal was to wait to be liberated by the Americans. And hope the Russians didn’t get there first. 

&gt; After Stalin beat the German, UK alone would have been enough to stay safe. 

The UK could not handle Germany alone. Let alone the full strength of the Soviet Union at the end of 1945. What are you talking about. 

&gt; we kicked them out.

You asked the Americans to leave and they chose to do so. You had no more ability to kick them out than the Iraqis do today. 

&gt; So you're simply wrong.

Or you’re simply an edgy French teenager who is angry that France’s illusions of grandeur are hundreds of years in the past.

5623,"&gt; That said, similar attitudes to the poor *in general* absolutely existed. 

That doesn't change the fact that Trevelyan viewed the famine as an effective means of population control in Ireland. That is not a controversial statement. It is based on his own words.

Also, like you said 'similar attitudes' to the poor, not the same attitudes. Ireland and the Irish were viewed very differently to England and the English for example.

5664,"&gt; Exactly. That's what they argue, island should be neutral. That's what Treaty of Lausanne demands and that's what both countries should do.  

Again, you're misinformed. If by ""neutral"" you mean that the island shouldn't belong to anyone, that's definitely not what the treaty says. I explained on my others comments that according to the treaty of Lausanne, the island is Greek. Just Greek. Turkey only gets the islands within 3 n.m. of their shores and the Imia islands are outside that range, therefore Greek. If by ""neutral"" you mean demilitarized then again i dunno wtf you're talking about cause those islands are not militarized at all. They're two empty rocks. Why are you even commening when you're entirely ignorant on the matter?

The islands aren't neutral even now. Greece claims they're Greek and all other relevant countries agree with Greece. For all intents and purposes, those islands are Greek, with or without a flag on them lol.

&gt; They're gonna do what they did in Kardak and Cyprus.

Lol please. I'd love to see Turkey invading a NATO country. See how well it goes for it. In Imia Turkey withdrew and in Cyprus Turkey didn't fight Greece. In fact the last time the Greek and Turkish fleets fought, [it didn't go so well for the Turkish fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_cruiser_Georgios_Averof#Balkan_Wars)

&gt; Yes, I am a Turk because I challenge you 

You're a Turk for many reasons. You're parroting turkish nationalist propaganda, you're subscribed to fenerbahce, youy're advocating for Turkey to release refugees etc. Are you THAT ashamed of your origins that you try to hide it?

I've already gone through the military stuff. If Turkey could afford a war with a country that has the same airforce (and more advanced) than it, it would have already done something about the islands.

&gt; Don't assume Europe will come and help you. It's not our problem, really. Italy and Turkey are doing dual-military operations in December according to Nato and Greece are protesting. It's not our problem to go to war with Turkey. 

The refugees would spill all over Europe, don't think that Greece would keep em all, so you bet it's Europe's problem. You're definitely not talking on behalf of Italy, you're a Turkish shill living in another country. Don't kid yourself. 

&gt; It's your problem and you deal with it yourself. Are you scared to go to war with Turkey alone? Why do you ask for Europe's support? :) 

Is this the Turkish way of sayting ""1v1 me brah"" to a country 8 times smaller than Turkey? Why would we *not* ask for support? I can see how that's not convenient for you but the sad truth is that Turkey has managed to isolate itself diplomatically from everyone, even the USA. Are you salty that you can't do anything about Greece? :)

&gt; Europe, for sure, wouldn't want to risk facing Russia and Turkey together. So, in the end, you and Turkey are alone in the war. We all know what that ends usually lol. 

Russia wouldn't move a finger for Turkey against Europe. You're flattering yourself if you think you're allies. Russia has its own agenda. It's using Turkey where Turkey is relevant. You think it would go against the EU in order to get cozy with... Turkey? Come on. Greece is already alone against Turkey as you portray it and yet Turkey does nothing. You'll risk losing 70% of your airforce and navy and then be demolished under an avalance of sanctions from the entire world for a couple of islands? This is not a Cyprus scenario.

5677,"The Sanremo song festival of this year marks the 70th edition since it was staged in 1955. 

Diodato won with the song [Fai rumore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFr8xbkvFLc). Singers who won the Sanremo song festival are automatically selected by RAI, the national broadcaster, to be the entry for the Eurovision song contest. The song, by rule, has to be sung in Italian. 


**What do the “Fai rumore” lyrics mean?**

A beautiful description of the song was written by Alessandro Alicandri on TV Sorrisi e Canzoni.

Love is so all-consuming that its absence can create a painful silence. In fact, it creates familiar sounds that bring us back to those who no longer love us.

Hearing — and indeed the inability to hear — is the main element of Diodato’s track “Fai rumore”. If a love story is a feast for the senses, the end of a relationship is a room made of unbearable silence interrupted by familiar noises.

Every noise can become a reminder of who we loved — their sonic traces are engraved in our memory, taking us back to places where we shouldn’t go. Drawn into that space, it’s impossible not to get hurt.

The song ends with the words, “And now I don’t want to do without / That beautiful noise you make”. Many say that it’s better to close a door properly in order to move on, but there’s an inevitable hurdle: the fact that we’re not always ready to do that.

The taste of letting go is bitter, but it is a necessary medicine. Diodato — indeed, all of us — must understand that there is no future if we let ourselves be carried away by memories of the past. But in the meantime, leave me here to listen.

**Italian text**

Sai che cosa penso?
Che non dovrei pensare
che se poi penso sono un animale
e se ti penso tu sei un’anima

Ma forse è questo temporale
che mi porta da te
e lo so, non dovrei farmi trovare
senza un ombrello, anche se

Ho capito che
per quanto io fugga
torno sempre a te

Che fai rumore qui
e non lo so se mi fa bene
se il tuo rumore mi conviene

Ma fai rumore, sì
che non lo posso sopportare
questo silenzio innaturale tra me e te

E me ne vado in giro senza parlare
senza un posto a cui arrivare
consumo le mie scarpe
e forse le mie scarpe
sanno bene dove andare

Che mi ritrovo negli stessi posti
proprio quei posti che dovevo evitare
e faccio finta di non ricordare
e faccio finta di dimenticare

Ma capisco che
per quanto io fugga
torno sempre a te

Che fai rumore qui
e non lo so se mi fa bene
se il tuo rumore mi conviene

Ma fai rumore, sì
che non lo posso sopportare
questo silenzio innaturale tra me e te

Ma fai rumore, sì
che non lo posso sopportare
questo silenzio innaturale

E non ne voglio fare a meno oramai
di quel bellissimo rumore che fai

**English translation**

You know what I think?
That I shouldn’t be thinking,
that if I think about it then, I’m an animal
and if I think about you, you’re a soul

But maybe it’s this storm
that brings me to you
And I know I shouldn’t be found
without an umbrella, even though

I realized that
as far as I run away
I always come back to you

Who make noise, here
and I don’t know if it’s good for me
if your noise suits me

But you make noise, yes
and I can’t stand
this unnatural silence between you and me

And I’m walking without talking
with nowhere to go
I’m wearing down my shoes
and perhaps my shoes
know where to go

That I find myself in the same places again,
exactly those places that I should have avoided
and I pretend I don’t remember
and I pretend to forget

But I realize that
as far as I run away
I always come back to you

Who make noise, here
and I don’t know if it’s good for me
if your noise suits me

But you make noise, yes
and I can’t stand
this unnatural silence between you and me

But you make noise, yes
and I can’t stand
this unnatural silence

And now I don’t want to do without
that beautiful noise you make

5706,"&gt; Emmanuel Macron has waded into a row over a schoolgirl whose attack on Islam has divided France, insisting that blasphemy is “no crime”.

&gt; The French president defended the teenager, named only as Mila, who received death threats and was forced out of her school after filming an anti-religious diatribe on social media.

&gt; Macron’s intervention comes after his justice minister, Nicole Belloubet, was criticised for claiming Mila’s attack on religion was “an attack on freedom of conscience” while saying the death threats were “unacceptable”.

&gt; The case has sparked a furious public debate in France, a strictly secular republic with a large Muslim population. The education authorities have since found another school for the teenager.

&gt; “In this debate we have lost sight of the fact that Mila is an adolescent. We owe her protection at school, in her daily life, in her movements,” Macron said in an interview with Le Dauphiné Libéré newspaper.

&gt; The president added that in finding a new school for Mila, “the state has fulfilled its responsibilities” and that children needed to be “better protected” against “new forms of hatred and harassment online that can be destructive”.

&gt; “That necessity is separate from the criticism of religion. The law is clear: we have the right to blaspheme, to criticise, to caricature religions. The republican order is not a moral order … what is outlawed is to incite hatred and attack dignity,” Macron added.

&gt; Mila, 16, from near Lyon, became a cause célèbre in January after she made a live broadcast on her Instagram account in which she spoke about her homosexuality. A Muslim commentator responded she was a “dirty lesbian” and a “dirty whore”. She responded by posting a video diatribe against Islam.

&gt; Her outburst sparked death threats and social media users posted her personal information online, including where she was attending school. The public prosecutor has opened an investigation for “death threats, threats to commit a crime and harassment” against her attackers and a separate inquiry into whether she had “provoked religious hatred”, which is punishable by the law.

&gt; Abdallah Zekri, general delegate of the French Council for the Muslim Faith (CFCM), told French radio: “This girl knows exactly what she has done … they who sow, reap.” Zekri added that the teenager’s comments were not covered by freedom of expression but were insulting and provocative. Afterwards, Mohammed Moussaoui, the new head of the CFCM, said criticism of Islam had to be accepted and no remarks justified death threats. “We have to accept all the debates and refuse all violence,” Moussaoui wrote.

&gt; Mila has appeared on French television to say she did not regret the video and to defend the right to blaspheme. She also apologised to those who practise their religion “in peace”.

&gt; The far-right leader Marine Le Pen has defended the teenager, saying what she said “may be considered vulgar, but we cannot accept that, in 21st century France, some condemn her to death”.

&gt; The case has brought echos of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in 2015, which the perpetrators claimed was in retribution for the satirical newspaper publishing cartoons several years previously of the prophet Mohammed that were considered offensive by many Muslims. In a 2007 legal case against the paper, judges declared: “In France it is possible to insult a religion, its figures and its symbols … however, insulting those who follow a religion is outlawed.”",,/r/europe/comments/f2v055/blasphemy_is_no_crime_says_macron_amid_french/fhetq98/,quixotic_cynic,1581529728

5710,"&gt;Wrong. Treaty of Lausanne doesn't say that. You don't own Kardak according to Lausanne. You cannot claim all the small islands there you see. It's illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You know, I studied Political Science in New York University

Lmao, man i gotta tell you, if you studied political science in NYU and you're typing things like that, i suggest that you tear up any diplomas that you (definitely don't) have and try being a farmer instead. 

Could you elaborate a bit on your position? According to Article 12 of the Lausanne treaty: *""\[...\] Except where a provision to the contrary is contained in the present Treaty, the islands situated at less than three miles from the Asiatic coast remain under Turkish sovereignty.""*

According to Article 16 of the same treaty:  *""Turkey hereby renounces all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting the territories situated outside the frontiers laid down in the present Treaty and the islands other than those over which her sovereignty is recognised by the said Treaty, the future of these territories and islands being settled or to be settled by the parties concerned. \[...\]""*

This flat out claims that the only islands of the Dodecanese complex that belong to Turkey, are those situated within 3 n.m. of its coast. The Imia are outside of that and therefore Greek according to the treaty.

&gt;They say, according to Treaty of Lausanne, those islands should stay as neutral.

Then the Turks that say that might have to re-take reading lessons cause the treaty of Lausanne doesn't say anywhere that those islands are neutral. Turkey might wish it said that, but it doesn't. Unless you can point out for me where it says it?

&gt;If you have NYU Login, I can direct you to NYU forum, so you can read what Americans are saying too.  You have 13 illegal island occuyping in Aegean sea, where it's forbidden by Treaty. They're not Chios, Lesvos, Rhodes. Those are not tiny. We're talking small islands like Kardak.

You don't need to direct me there. Since you've studied political sciences as you say, and since you've discussed this, you should be able to tell me why and how they're ""illegally"" occupied and according to which part of the Lausane Treaty. Explain to me what does the treaty say and where so i can see it. Cause right above i gave you the exact articles that say that Turkey renounces all claims to those islands, but it's not said anywhere that Greece does not own them. The rest of the islands were given to Italy and then Italy gave them to Greece so the rest of the islands (except for the ones 3 n.m. away from the coast) are Greek. You keep talking about it but you're not explaining anything.

I only mentioned Rhodes, Lesbos, Chios etc because those are the islands that Turkey says should be DEMILITARIZED. I'm not talking about Turkey claiming ownership of them. You're simply confusing two different subjects. But since you want to focus on tiny islands that you say should be neutral, tell me according to which part of the treaty they should be neutral.

In Poland current average pension is 54% of last salary, this is projected to drop to mid-20% by 2040-2050. Put it differently: by the time you retire your retirement pension is projected to be 1/4 of your salary prior to that. Yet nobody is seems concerned, in fact the current government came to power with explicit promise to roll back the retirement age extension passed by the previous government (which was meant to equalize the retirement age at 67 for both sexes vs. 65/60 that is is today)

Couple that with European approach to retirement being totally different than in America (where from the start you know you have to save privately) and at some point hell will break lose - even know in France there were major protests regarding new retirement project that will link your retirement closely to the amount you saved via a public system. There again one of the major point of contention was the extension of retirement age (legal limit being 62, however with a new limit at 64, retiring early would have carried a penalty, retiring later a bonus).",,/r/europe/comments/f2ombv/italy_is_about_to_face_a_terrible_demographic/fhegn5n/,castorkrieg,1581521989

5916,"&gt;Twilight of the Euro
2020 was supposed to be the year when Europe began to shine. After suffering the decision by the U.K. to leave, the European Union had the chance to move forward with greater certainty. The easing of the U.S.-China trade war would aid recovery after a slump in manufacturing that appeared to be ending. And the euro could start to strengthen against the dollar, in a consummation devoutly wished in the capitals of Europe and the U.S.

&gt;It hasn’t worked out that way. After an ugly day’s trading on Monday, the euro is at its weakest in four months, close to setting a 30-month low, and once more below its level on the day of the U.S. election in November 2016. One again the euro is falling down.

&gt;What exactly is going on? There is no one single factor behind the decline, but rather an overwhelming combination of circumstances that is pushing the currency lower.

&gt;First of all, of course, there is politics. Across Europe, the center cannot hold. In Germany, the dispute over whether to allow the right-wing Alternative for Germany to take any part in the Thuringian state government led over the weekend to the resignation of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union and Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as chancellor. German politics is thereby thrown into chaos.

&gt;In Ireland, the emergence of the radical and left-wing Sinn Fein in the country’s general election as the largest party in its lower house has similarly left the established parties of center-left and center-right in a state of confusion. Irish politics have also been realigned, and it isn’t clear what kind of policies or approach to government will emerge.

&gt;Then there is the manufacturing sector. On Monday, Italy followed Germany and France in reporting dreadful industrial production figures for the end of last year. The coronavirus had had no effect at this point; manufacturing was supposedly picking up again and awaiting a boost from renewed Chinese post-trade war demand. We now see that all of the eurozone’s biggest three economies ended the year slowing sharply.

&gt;This is bad because, thirdly, the eurozone is these days no place to take shelter from trouble in the Chinese economy. A slowdown of some dimension for China can now be taken as a given, just as a result of the belated measures to contain the epidemic. Sadly for Europe, this will come as Germany had put itself at China’s economic mercy. Data from the International Monetary Fund show that exports from Germany to China now slightly exceed those from the U.S., a much larger economy.

&gt;If you want a haven from China, then, it is certainly not the euro. And it is probably the dollar. This chart from John Velis of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. shows that even though the U.S. has been the international aggressor in taking on China’s trade power, it stands to lose the least from that economy’s current difficulties. It is the obvious haven:

&gt;Beyond these fundamental reasons, there is also the technical issue that the euro has become a highly attractive currency for funding carry trades — the practice of borrowing in a currency with low interest rates, parking in one with higher rates and pocketing the difference, or “carry.” Traditionally, carry trades have been almost synonymous with the Japanese yen, which was used as the funding currency for many bets that went disastrously wrong during the global financial crisis. But now the euro, with its negative rates, works even better. Over the last five year it has been a far more profitable funding currency for those wanting to park in Mexican pesos, for example, than the yen:

&gt;When a currency becomes popular for funding carry trades, it naturally comes under downward pressure. That is contributing to the euro’s problems.

&gt;Even taking all of this into account, however, it is clear that the dollar seems mighty attractive to foreign exchange traders at present. To show this, look at the following chart, which shows the gap between 10-year bond yields in the U.S. and Germany. This should be a critical driver of an exchange rate, with funds attracted to the higher rate. As the differential reduces, we would expect the currency with the higher rates to weaken. But as the chart shows, the differential has been narrowing in the euro’s favor, very consistently, since late in 2018. And it hasn’t helped. The Federal Reserve is now expected to cut target rates at least once this year with a 50-50 chance of a second reduction, according to fed funds futures, while the European Central Bank stands still. And that also makes no difference. Dollar strength runs directly counter to the pressures emanating from bond markets:

&gt;So why is money running toward the U.S., despite everything? Without wishing to pile on to any political triumphalism, the markets are obviously partial to the current situation, where Senator Bernie Sanders is seen as likely to be nominated for president by the Democrats, and also likely to lose to Donald Trump. There is also some triumphalism around U.S. companies. The biggest companies in the world, at present, are all American, and they are busily conquering the rest of the planet. U.S. internet groups’ dominance has helped to ensure that the U.S. stock market continues to outperform the rest of the world, and particularly Europe, to a remarkable extent. The chart shows the relative performance of U.S. stocks since the beginning of 1999, when the euro came into being.

&gt;When capital flows into corporate America like this, plainly it strengthens the dollar. On a trade-weighted basis, the dollar just enjoyed its strongest week in almost a year.

&gt;This does look a little like triumphalism. As Marc Chandler of Bannockburn Global Forex in New York puts it, the coronavirus is now widely interpreted as the moment that revealed China isn’t, in fact, ready to challenge American economic hegemony, while there is also excitement at the notion that the botched handling of the situation in Wuhan could yet signal major trouble for China’s political model.

&gt;Couple that with a sense that Europe, whose common currency was intended two decades ago to launch another challenge to American exorbitant privilege, is also now revealing a deeply flawed political model, to go with a structurally challenged economy, and you have what could be a moment of classic market revulsion for Europe, combined with American triumph, and a very strong dollar.

&gt;Could the triumphalism be premature? Of course it could. America’s own political system is being bent in a number of different shapes, and we have nine more months of classic U.S. political soap opera to look forward to until the election. It is very possible that someone other than Donald Trump will be president at the end of it; conceivably someone who calls themselves a socialist. But for now, this is a moment of American triumph and European defeat, and it shows up clearly in the zero-sum game of the foreign exchange market.",Transnistria,/r/europe/comments/f2rfd6/things_are_falling_apart_for_europes_single/fhe6xxl/,icecream420,1581515402

In Finland and several other countries the distinction has never been that clear.
