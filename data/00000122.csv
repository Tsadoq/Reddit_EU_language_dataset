You can also ask them whether Russia hypothetically had the right to intervene militarily in Crimea if there were clashes and several hundred lives were lost and they adamantly say no. Russia would need a UN resolution authorising this.

Yet that us exactly what they did in Kosovo. Intervene without UN resolution after several hundred lives were lost in clashes under the Responsibility to Protect principle. Yet that Responsibility to Protect does not apply to others.

If it were ""a matter of wider principle"", NATO and the West in general would not have been so instrumental in helping Serbian (Albanian?) separatists in Kosovo. 

The West was the first to open Pandora's box. Don't even start on the possible ""humanitarian reasons"". One can find plenty of such reasons in every corner of the world, if needs be. The West chose Kosovo so that the Americans could build a military base there. 

In short, you reap what you sow. If using a military occupation for carving up countries was okay for the West, the rest of the world would've inevitably followed anyway.

Because he wanted to rule Europe and saw us as a potential block to ""integration"".

&gt;When Britain finally joined in the 70s, it was the sick man of Europe, Britain was considered less attractive economically speaking than Italy.

Thanks far-left Labour. Thankfully the public will never let them get in again.

&gt;Under Thatcher government, they scuttled the whole project, changing it to a financial clusterfuck with London at the center laundering money and developping tax havens across British dependencies.

She fixed it. As for British overseas tax havens, they are self governing *outside* of the UK and EU. The more dangerous tax havens are the RoI/Luxembourg etc that are inside the EU.

&gt;Economic reason you say? Cornwall and Wales are the only Western European regions besides Portugal and Southern Italy to receive more EU funds than giving it.

Source please. They receive funds, but I have never seen any proof that it exceeds what they pay in,

&gt;Plus the unjustified rebate that only the UK had out of the 28.

The rebate is entirely justified - we'd be paying about the same as Germany otherwise, a far richer and more populous country that actually benefits from being in the EU.

I'd rather the EU funding system was fixed. Perhaps if we weren't extorted of ¬£10,000,000,000 to trade with our ""friends"" we wouldn't have been so keen to become independent.

What you see now is just the market accepting that the post referendum evaluation is roughly the new normal. The UK economy is going to be smaller than what it could have been.

First of all Russian macroeconomics is really very well. 

\&gt;Measuring gdp per PPP is pointless for anything but internal poverty and you know it.

The second thing. Nominal GDP shows nothing because of the fluent currency course. 

For example, the Russian Nominal GDP before 2014 was twice bigger. Is it mean the economy of Russia was twice bigger in 2014? No.

Read the wiki. GDP PPP is the better parameter to compare countries.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_GDP\_(PPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)) 

\&gt;GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using [nominal GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)) when assessing a nation's domestic market because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates which may distort the real differences in per capita income.

* the atrocities of the Nazis and the associated collective German guilt
* modern racism and antisemitism

Those are not interchangeable things. The members of Antisemite-movements of today did NOT put people in concentration camps or ghettos and did NOT kill millions of innocent people. They did NOT partake in any ethnical cleansing in any way. What they do against Jews are considered crimes in Germany and as such punishable by law.

Also maybe check what kind of sources your girlfriend is using, because the only sources I could find supporting the ""Anti-Jew capital of Europe"" argument is from very dodgy ones and from the Bild (equivalent to the Sun, so maybe even dodgier than the other sources, which are exclusively partisan online newspapers(-blogs). A more reliable (yet in some way still a somewhat controversial) source would be the SPIEGEL with this [article](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/berlin-monitor-so-verbreitet-ist-antisemitismus-in-der-hauptstadt-a-1282760.html) which paints a more realistic picture. It talks about 10% of Berlin citizens answering a survey in which they answer ""fully agree"" or ""partly agree"" to antisemitic statements. Still, a concerningly high number, but not surprising, considering the 12% AFD-voters over there (however tbf I'm not sure how the overlap between AFD-voters and antisemites, AFD has more of an anti-muslim agenda). It also talks about a rise of antisemitic crimes both in number and intensity. 

Which leads to the real ""massive problem"": This rise is not only true for antisemitic crimes but for all right-winged crimes. The rise of nationalism in Europe (not only Germany), which is fueled by non-EU powers (read: Putin). This is the massive problem your girlfriend probably alluded to.

The generally accepted position in the world 80 years ago was that jews were sub human and need to be ethnically cleansed. 

Israel exists for the protection of the jews. My family had to choose between being persecuted or fleeing to Israel and fighting for their lives. I don't agree with everything Israel does. I'm a proponent of the two state solution. But pretending that the arabs are innocent by-standers in this whole situation is disingenuous.  As far as I'm concerned if you oppose the existence of Israel, The state that exists only because jewish persecution was so prevalent, you are an antisemite. 

Here is a source more specific for berlin if that makes you happy:

&gt;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Berlin has surpassed Malm√∂ as Europe‚Äôs antisemitism capital, with a wide variety of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel attitudes on display. They include dozens of cases of physical aggression against Jews, including rabbis. Jewish pupils have had to leave public schools. Thirty-five percent of Berliners view Israelis as analogous to Nazis. An Al-Quds Day march takes place annually that calls for the destruction of Israel. Both the municipality and the federal government are two-faced  about the problem of antisemitism.

When it comes to global power? Definitely yes. They could buy twice as many American politicians, that‚Äôs correct. The reason for this is that in 2014, the oil price was still high, and the Russian economy was basically entirely oil based. If you look at a graph of oil price, you get an inverse graph of Russian GDP. Without the most important commodity, they‚Äôre swimming in quick sand, using up their reserves.

Exactly. There is no sane reason. But they did. They also took Crimea even though they fully knew that the costs would outweigh the benefits. It didn‚Äôt make any sense, but they did it.

352,"&gt; It was announced on Sunday that Athens will host the signing ceremony for the groundbreaking agreement for the construction of the ‚ÄùEastMed Pipeline,‚Äù which will eventually transport natural gas from Israel, Cyprus and Greece to Italy and on to the rest of the EU.
&gt; 
&gt; Cypriot President Nikos Anastasiades, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will sign the agreement for the mega-project, which is expected to cost between 6 and 7 billion euros.
&gt; 
&gt; The nation of Italy is expected to sign the agreement at a later stage since it will take a significant amount of time just to finalize the portion of the project which will connect Israel, Cyprus and Greece.
&gt; 
&gt; Athens sincerely hopes that it will derive concrete benefits from the construction of the pipeline, and there are plenty of good reasons to believe that this will come to pass.
&gt; 
&gt; A cooperative agreement was signed last year by the then-Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his Cypriot and Israeli counterparts, but now the project is set to finally enter the phase of implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; Talks between the three nations on the issue began in 2015 and have progressed so well that a solid alliance between them has now formed, known as ‚ÄùThe Tripartite of Cyprus, Israel and Greece.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The three Mediterranean countries aim to intensify their cooperation on every level, and even make this collaboration permanent at some point in the near future with the establishment of a joint secretariat based in Cyprus.
&gt; 
&gt; The East Med pipeline is actively supported both by the European Union and the United States, who believe that it can play an important role in Europe‚Äôs efforts to diversify its energy sources since it currently depends overwhelmingly on Russian resources.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the issue of exactly how to transport natural gas from the drilling areas to Western Europe still remains in question. The plans for the East Med Pipeline project currently under discussion call for the construction of a 1,900-km (1181-mile) pipeline under the eastern Mediterranean.
&gt; 
&gt; The pipeline will begin in the natural gas fields off the coast of Israel, and will lead through the islands of Cyprus and Crete to the Peloponnesian Peninsula in Greece.
&gt; 
&gt; The route will then continue onto mainland Greece, where the pipeline will meet the planned ‚ÄúPoseidon‚Äù pipeline which will end in Otranto, Italy. The natural gas could then continue northward to central and western Europe, most probably by using already- existing pipelines.
&gt; 
&gt; A full 1,300 km (808 miles) of the 1,900 km of the pipeline will run underwater. All parties involved in the project understand that this presents a great technical challenge, since the Mediterranean in those areas can reach depths of up to 3,000 meters (9,843 feet, or almost two miles).
&gt; 
&gt; However, preliminary studies have shown that the project is both technically possible and financially viable since it could be a main energy artery for the entire European Union in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking on the developments on Sunday evening, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias stated ‚ÄùWhat we do is not a reaction to anyone. It is an effort to improve the quality of life of the citizens of our countries, to improve our economies, to provide solutions. The EastMed pipeline is a great energy boost to the European Union‚Äôs energy balance as well.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; However, Turkey has repeatedly said that no agreement in the region can be implemented unless Ankara also participates in it, showing complete disdain for international law and the region‚Äôs maritime boundaries.

Yes. That‚Äôs what nominal GDP is for. It compares all countries in the same currency. If all Russian goods and services were exported, they‚Äôd be worth half as much now. That‚Äôs what happens if you rely on oil. I already told you this. The same thing happened to Venezuela. PPP tells how much you can buy in Russia with your rubles. Once again, that‚Äôs irrelevant.

What‚Äôs threatening about the enlargement of NATO? It‚Äôs a defensive alliance. They don‚Äôt attack anyone. They do however remove the possibility for Russia to invade them, thanks to the nuclear umbrella. That‚Äôs the sad thing about all this. Russia invaded Georgia and Ukraine, because they both felt threatened by invasion and didn‚Äôt want to live in fear anymore. 

In no way can you ever paint Russia to be the good guy. They‚Äôre literally a terrorist nation. Their main export is fear, and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre known for. Fear, terror and war. And you‚Äôre surprised the neighbours don‚Äôt want it anymore? Jesus Christ.

Why do you think Georgia and Ukraine wanted to join nato? Why do you think my country and Finland has not done so? Because we‚Äôve been threatened by war if we try to join. All neighbours have entire populations living in fear of invasion for generations. What kind of country is that to subject their neighbours in such a way? Remember my comparison to North Korea?

He took part in the anti-CAA protest on the campus.

Carrying a placard that said ‚Äú1933-1945. We have been there,‚Äù denoting the beginning and end of Hitler‚Äôs regime in Germany, he said that though there was discrimination against Jews in 1933, it was not clearly visible then that it would eventually lead to mass deportations and genocide. ‚ÄúIn the beginning, we never know where it will all end,‚Äù he had said.

Chinta Bar, a student collective in the IIT, expressed solidarity with Mr. Lindenthal. In a statement, it extended gratitude to him for being part of the struggle to protect the rights of Indians and for his concerns towards humanity.

At least 15 people, including an 8-year-old boy, have lost their lives in Modi party ruled state Uttar Pradesh as the protests against the discriminatory Citizenship (Amendment) Act law.

Indian Modi regime plans big detention camps for Muslim migrants.

More than four million people in India, mostly Muslims, are at risk of being declared foreign migrants as the government pushes a hard-line Hindu nationalist agenda that has challenged the country‚Äôs pluralist traditions and aims to redefine what it means to be Indian.

Weird. Its about an English tourist who travels to Ruritania (a tiny German speaking monarchy) where he's mistaken for the crown prince who is then kidnapped by the villains forcing the Englishman to pretend to be the crown prince, culminating in a duel against the dastardly Rupert of Hentzau.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner_of_Zenda

The book spawned a subgenre, the Ruritanian romance about courtly intrigue and adventures in tiny fictional European countries - Tintin and King Ottokar's sceptre is one example.

Those incidents took place not only in France and Germany, where antisemitic incidents are the highest in Europe, but also in Belgium, Austria, and the United Kingdom. In those countries, physical assaults against Jews including beatings, stabbings and other violence, increased markedly, in a number of cases resulting in serious injury and even death

539,"Just like how Mercedes was going to take on Tesla? Yeah, what an embarrassment for German engineering and the German car industry. They're now buying out technology from Ford and Microsoft, testing their latest high tech vehicles in the US rather than Europe. 

I was watching a story comparing ESA and ESA partnering private industry to that of the US. US has decades of advancement starting with Ronald Reagan that allowed private industry to do such things that only the government could previously do. Throughout the years NASA couldn't keep up with its own ambitions so it hired more and more. It setup these brilliant competitions that go on to this day where people from every corner of the world can come share their creation in a competition in hopes of NASA picking them. The partnership NASA creates in these programmes both behind closed doors or public competitions allows creativity to flourish, to thrive with no limits except your engineering capabilities and a bit of investment. 

I have never in my travels seen a single person wear an ESA t-shirt outside of the EU and even in the EU I see far more NASA shirts than I do ESA. The logo is iconic but whats behind that logo is far more iconic and historic. Europeans rather it be Jewish scientist that fled from Poland along with Albert Einstein from Germany or German scientist surrendering to the Americans to be taken to Texas to work on the buildup of NASA.. Europeans helped make NASA possible. What's possible too is to recreate ESA with the same ambitions John F Kennedy had all those years ago or Ronald Reagan when he allowed companies like SpaceX to even exist or Barack Obama that reinvigorated NASA and its budget. 

The problem with the EU is we're not a single country, we are a union. We're not all on the same exact page when it comes to the ESA but rather a mess of agreements that're fought for usually with political might. And we certainly dont have an African American like Elon Musk, brotha from a different motha. 

We keep fumbling, German autoindustry, fucking Brexit, ESA even with its new budget. I would love to actually believe this article to be true, to say that perhaps in 5-10 years we'll be toe to toe with SpaceX or whatever top private space industry the US has but I'd be incredibly naive to think we'd even be close to them or even India for that matter. 

There are sooo many reasons but this is one of them.. I really wish if we were going for this whole United States of Europe or whatever it'll be called that we do it now like right now and not later. A century of being left in 3rd position will be a very hard hole to climb out of, especially all of these documentaries I see about Africa rising from the dust like China did! Fuck me sideways and then you have Asian countries growing and growing, forming more blocs.

The Islamic Golden Age caused the European Enlightenment. It was specifically Arab scientists and philosophers who transmitted knowledge into Europe when Europeans were still burning books for heresy. The [Transmission of Greek Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_of_the_Greek_Classics) happened through the Islamic world into Europe. They did not only transmit the classics, they wrote treatises and added on to them. In philosophy and in [mathematics](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08dr5qt). Your entire idea of 'Europe' is thanks to Muslims. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_world_contributions_to_Medieval_Europe) is a wiki page on Muslim conributions to Europe. [Here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/islamic-science-and-making-european-renaissance) is a book on the Islamic origins of the European Enlightenment. [Here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/topics/Islamic_philosophers) is a list of episodes of the In Our Time podcast that deal with Muslim philosophers and thinkers. [Here](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-self-taught-philosopher-how-a-900-year-old-arabic-tale-inspired-the-enlightenment-1.4116060) is a podcast on how Ibn Tufayl affected the Enlightenment. Before the Enlightenment, you can already see the cultural influence of Islamic Iberia and Sicily through [the imitation coins](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/gold-dinar-of-king-offa) of Anglo-Saxon King Offa.

Everything from medicine to philosophy to architecture was impacted by the Islamic rule in Europe. The concept of the university [was influenced by the Islamic madrasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasa#Madrasa_and_university). Which is why [the 3 oldest universities in the world](https://collegestats.org/2009/12/top-10-oldest-universities-in-the-world-ancient-colleges/) are in Islamic contries, Morocco, Egypt, and Iran, and Europe's oldest university is in Italy, one of the countries most affeced by Islamic thought. You like Gothic architecture? Well thank Islamic architecture where the pointed arch was developed over 600 years before Europe. The [interlaced arches](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/F95WRJ/norman-arches-in-the-medieval-christian-cathedral-of-ely-england-originally-F95WRJ.jpg of Gothic architecture is a copy-paste of the Islamic version from the 7th and 8th centuries, spread through Sicily and Spain. Even the [Durham Cathedral](https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/intro/galilee-chapel/andalusian-influences) website concedes that. If you bother to travel to either place and educate yourself, you'll see absolutely clearly the influence of the mosque on medieval Christian architecture. In Sicily they call their style Arabo-Normana, and from there the Normans took it to northern Europe. You like cathedrals and monastery cloisters? A direct copy from mosques, as seen from the earliest cloisters, such as [this one in Spain](https://cdn.britannica.com/68/150068-004-5413817B/Cloister-Convent-San-Juan-del-Duero-Spain.jpg). From the ornament to the arches to the arcaded routes around the edges. Christopher Wren famously said (p.326 of Jonathan Glancey, Archicture ): ‚ÄúThis we now call the Gothick manner of architecture‚Ä¶tho‚Äô the Goths were rather destroyers than builders I think it should with more reason be called the Saracen style; for those people wanted neither arts nor learning.‚Äù He continues: ""and even in this island there are not wanting several examples of the same: such buildings have been vulgarly called Modern Gothic, but their true appellation is Arabic, Saracenic, or Moresque. This manner was introduced into Europe through Spain; learning flourished among the Arabian all the time that their dominion was in full power; they studied philosophy, mathematics, physics, and poetry. The love of learning was at once excited, in all places that were not at too great distance from Spain these authors were read, and such of the Greek authors as they had translated into Arabic, were from thence turned into Latin. The physics and philosophy of the Arabians spread themselves in Europe, and with these their architecture: many churches were built after the Saracenic mode; and others with a mixture of heavy and light proportions: the alteration that the difference of the climate might require was little, if at all, considered."" Meanwhile, Glenn Lowry states in ""Islam and the Medieval West"" that:  ""the builders of St. Andrew's Cathedral not only copied Islamic architectural features, but emulated their specific uses in religious settings as well. This was more than imitation‚Äîit was wholesale adoption.""  In the arts, pseudo-Kufic script appears throughout Renaissance art, such as [The Adoration of the Magi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gentile_da_Fabriano_015.jpg)

The only thing Belgium is good at is stealing other people's culture. That's why you claim Greek and Roman culure, when Belgium was never more than a shitty suburb of the empire. The Middle East was an integral part of those culures and their inheritors. That's why Caesar wanted to marry an Egyptian, not a Belgian. That's why Romans considered the Germanics to be barbarians and instead were fascinated with eastern religions and cultures. That's why there were Arab Roman emperors and senators, not Belgian ones. Such as [Philip the Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_the_Arab), who was the first Christian Roman emperor. So you can thank us not only for teaching you Christianity, but also for spreading it to you. Or how about [Elagabalus]?(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus) Or [Caracalla?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla) Or [Julia Domna]?(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Domna) Or Salamallianus or Annius Fundanus? How many Belgian Roman or Greek emperor, senators, philosophers, mathematicians can you list? Fucking zero, because you are an appropriator and thief of culture, nothing more. That's why there are more stolen Middle Eastern artefacts in Belgian museums than all the historical Belgian artefacts put together.

Now as for European colonialism. First you claim that you're forced to learn about it in school, then you say idiotic nonsense like this? Did you not attend school? European colonialism raped the world and was a plague on the planet. Egypt and India were both some of the earliest places to begin an indutrial revolution. It is well recorded that Britain sent industrialists to India to learn from their steel making industry. Egypt in the 1830s was an empire that had conquered Greece, Saudi, Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria. Then Britain allied with Russia, Germany, the Austro-Hungarian empire, and Turkey, and forced Egypt to accept the [Treaty of Balta Liman.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Balta_Liman). That treaty completely destroyed Egypt's economy, ended its industrialization, and turned it into a farming society.

&gt; Practically every country the English occupied is now much better off.

I don't think i've ever seen a more ignorant statement on reddit. Fucking better off??? Have you ever read anything except the back of a shampoo bottle?? Britain destroyed Ireland so thoroughly that the population of Ireland *still hasn't recovered*. That's right - the population of Ireland was higher before the famine than it is today. Britain continued to force Ireland to export food to England throughout the famine, decimating the population. In south Asia, Britain caused [the Bengal Famine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Bengal_famine_of_1770) that killed over 10 million people. Ashok Desai proved empirically that the mean food consumption (in calories) was higher in Akbar's India than in 1960's India. Indians didn't reach those caloric levels again until the fucking 1990s. The train lines were used to steal goods out of India. R.C. Dutt proved that mortality in districts served by the railways was 5-6% higher during the Great Famine of 1876-1878, and British eye-witnesses claimed that the trains leaving the famine stricken areas were filled with grain headed to the UK. It is estimated that up to 80 million people died in famines during the British period. In Egypt, Tarik Yousef's paper 'Egypt's Growth Performance Under Economic Liberalism' showed that the GDP per capita didn't rise at all during English colonial rule. Peter Fryer states in his book 'Black People in the British Empire': ""When European merchant adventurers first reached India they did not find an industrial or technical backwater. On the contrary, 'the indutrial development of the country was at any rate not inferior to that of the more advanced European nations... India was.. a great manufacturing country. It had a prosperous textile industry whose cotton, silk, and woollen products were marketed for Europe... It had remarkable, and remarkably ancient, skills in iron-working. It had it own shipbuilding industry... It was generally acknowledged that the teak wood vessels of Bombay were greatly superior to the oaken walls of Old England."" The book goes on quite a bit about Indian industry. Finally it states: ""All this was altered under British rule. The long-term consequence of that rule was the de-industrialization of India."" After independence, Jawaharlal Nehru wrote that those parts of India which had been longest under British rule were the poorest. The estimated theft from India in the first 50 years of occupation is ¬£1 billion. The number of famines grew from 7 in the first half of the 19th century to 24 in the 2nd half. 

Sounds sooo much better off!

Ordo Iuris took a closer look at the Warsaw anti-discrimination program, directed at educational institutions in selected city districts. The organization believes that the program is conducive to ""LGBT ideology"" and that school board inspections appear.

Warsaw wants to introduce an anti-discrimination program to all schools in the city. The ""Human Rights Friendly School. How to Prevent Exclusion and Violence at School"" program is intended to counteract hate speech, hate speech and discrimination faced by young people in their educational establishments.

&amp;#x200B;

""We were alarmed by signals from school principals that some organizations are putting pressure on the program"" Human rights friendly school. How to prevent exclusion and violence at school ""not to be implemented. In our opinion - and assessment of many teachers and parents - it is very good and necessary ""We don't want it to be destroyed by people who manipulate the message. They are not after protecting children, although they still use this argument,"" says Ewa Rogala, a spokeswoman for the town hall, for Gazeta Wyborcza.

&amp;#x200B;

The program began even in 2018, where in Ochota training for teachers was organized, as well as a number of educational meetings with parents as well as pupils and pupils. This year, the city's president, Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, decided to expand it to include further districts. ""For us, the most important is the safety of our students and safety at school in general, but also issues related to tolerance. Regardless of where the children come from, what their material situation is, how fit they are, what their sexual orientation is, everyone in a Warsaw school should feel safe ""said Trzaskowski.

Currently, the program operates in Ochota, Wola and Wilan√≥w. Experts from the Warsaw Center for Educational and Social Innovation and Training (WCIES) are responsible for its organization. The opponent of such a program is Ordo Iuris. The right-wing organization believes that the anti-discrimination program is a great advantage for LGBT people.

&amp;#x200B;

""The materials recommended by WCIES include, among others, the postulate that every student reject the assumption that"" people are divided exclusively into women and men ""(this should also be done through the introduction of combined toilets). The message about the institution of marriage as a basis of family life ¬´and even the influence of parents on the sexual inclinations of their own children. Students are to be encouraged to celebrate the"" International Day of Education and Transgender / Transgender Rights "", to"" answer questions from a gender perspective ""and to"" contact the organization we can read on Ordo Iuris.

&amp;#x200B;

The town hall responds to the allegations. ""The analysis of Ordo Iuris is not true. The main goal of this program was to prepare teachers, school staff, but also parents to deal with the problem of aggression among students, teach them techniques of conflict resolution. Let's face it: school is aggressive. We devoted a lot of space to the problem of hate on the internet, the teachers themselves indicated that they were not prepared to deal with this issue, ""comments Joanna Gospodarczyk, director of the education office. He adds: ""The subject of gender identity does not dominate the program, it may appear as a premise of discrimination.""

&amp;#x200B;

In the town hall, it is unofficially said that after the Ordo Iuris campaign, inspections from the school board, subordinate to the PiS governor, started to be launched. In this general atmosphere of intimidation, Trzaskowski spoke, who wrote a letter to the directors and director of the branches from Wola, Wawer and Wilan√≥w, thus encouraging to take part in the action.

&amp;#x200B;

Ewa Rogala, a spokeswoman for the town hall, also spoke on this matter.

Congraulations, you're now more educated than all British citizens, who can't name a single fucking massacre. Want me to go on? Fryer discusses British rule in Africa extensively in his book. He states that Nigeria in 1948 was an example of ""the legacy of underdevelopment that Britain bequeathed to its colonies in black Africa"".

In the Middle East, nearly all the conflicts go directly back to British rule. The creation of Israel and the colonization of Palestine. The conflict between north and south Sudan. The Kurdish struggle for a state. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The Syrian invasion of Lebanon. All of it is thanks to Britain and some of those involve France as well. There wouldn't even be a state called Saudi Arabia if it wasn't for Britain. 

As for your idiotic garbage about the Islamic slave trade - it was orders of magnitude less brutal than the European slave trade. Nothing in the Islamic world ever came close to the brutality and sheer animal savagery of the Belgian rule in Africa. A fine example of Christian values. I shouldn't even have to cite that, it should be completely obvious to any mildly educated individual. Fryer states: ""It is often suggested that the Europeans merely took over and adapted to their own purposes a pre-existing system of slavery. This is a misleading over-simplification. Before the coming of the Europeans the institution of slavery was not widespread in Africa."" Shipping the slaves across the Atlantic meant that they were chained for 20 out of 24 hours. Around 1 in every 6 slaves, out of tens of millions of people, died during the journey. 

&gt; I'm sure we can find blood on any people's hands, and often far far worse than that of Europeans. 

No, you can't. Nothing in the entire history of the Middle East comes close to the European proficiency for mass murder and torture. Nothing in the Islamic world is anywhere close to the holocaust, to Belgian rule in Congo, to the genocide of north and south Americans, to the genocide of aboriginal Australasians, to the Atlantic slave trade.

No, absolutely not. It only deals with people who have cancer, not have the potential to get it. Incidence rate in US is pretty much the same as rest of the world. The fact that you don't know simple statistics and still argue is funny.

I'll try it one last time. In US, people who get cancer are 2 times more likely to SURVIVE cancer than in the UK.  Yes, that is entirely dependent on healthcare. 

To dumb it down even more. Say we have 200 patients with cancer.

Moreover you are latching on to Canada comparison for waiting times - I will take you on your word that USA has better waiting times than Canada, but does it have better waiting times than ALL the countries? And how do you actually answer that given that the waiting times are not officially measured so it's hard for me to find actual scientific comparisons (for example - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851013001759](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851013001759) does not have USA included due to lack of data). 

Stating that life expectancy has nothing to do with healthcare is a very bold claim to make. Especially if you start to consider economic implications of such an assumption - if it is low in impact why would anyone bother to spend money on it - that is surely irrational. But I think that it's just a bogus statement that you threw out there without any shred of evidence for this extraordinary claim.

686,"Yeah, that's just someone starting down the road. Every junkie is a functional junkie to start with. The idea that an opiate addict can relegate their addiction to only certain times and doses is evident that they are NOT an addict, but someone dependent upon a drug. Or even just a casual user talking bullshit online.

I suppose if he had absurd self-control and a huge amount of inherited wealth to blow through that he could probably go years. The damage from opiates won't kill you quickly, or even be obvious, but opiate addicts are different. I drink 6 beers a night. I've drank 6 beers a night for almost 10 years. That's a bad habit and not super healthy, and I definitely get somewhat intoxicated. However, I don't move to 12 beers, or liquor. Although my tolerance for alcohol has increased, it has never motivated me to try and expand my nightly routine or to start drinking during the day, or to drink in the morning to get rid of shakes, etc. Opiates rapidly lose their efficacy and you HAVE to keep upping your dose to get the same fleeting effects, because that is just the nature of the drug.

So, in my friend Billy's case (who passed away last year), he went from totally functional and holding a good job into using opiates. Started eating pills all day. Eventually it hurt his work and he lost his job. He started bartending and held it together enough to keep getting opiates. About 4 years in I saw him at a bar and he told me that he'd heard a guy selling heroin nearby had stuff with fentanyl in it and he wanted it. He also told me that he thought people who died from overdoses were just amateurs who didn't know how to handle it and that real heroin users would actively seek out batches that had killed other people because they knew it was strong.

I think his spiral lasted about 5 years. Only for the last year was he an obvious junkie that wasn't somewhat keeping his life in some kind of order. Opiates are a slide and I've never witnessed anyone keep using them regularly long-term without serious issues, usually death.",,/r/europe/comments/een29y/drug_risk_prevention_program_from_norway_this_is/fbvz0vu/,HereForTheDough,1577138149

And if you do too much, or happen to have a quality that makes you develop an addiction easily. It won't be much fun after addiction kicks in, just like alcohol. Alcohol addicts do not drink because they enjoy it, they drink it to avoid the pain of withdrawal symptoms.

Im not going to debate whether its safe to do heroin or not. I've never done it, nor am I an expert on it. If you are, please tell me why its not safe while keeping in mind there are people who do it safely.

Also, the continent goes further east. The climate gets worse for renewable energy. Look at even the current EU. Most of Poland is flat, has a continental climate with little wind and not a lot of sun during many months. So wind energy barely works in some north western parts and much less effectively. There aren‚Äôt any fast flowing rivers as it‚Äôs flat. Solar energy maybe works the best, but it‚Äôs a summer only solution, not much help in winter.

As to the SNP, they're not a radical party. They're a shit party don't get me wrong but they're able to win votes in Scotland because they're a left wing and progressive party that champions scottish nationalism. They're what pretty much what labour used to be fifty years ago. I personally would never vote for them but they're not a radical party. The reason the SNP wins seats is because they're scottish nationalists standing in scotland and that in Scotland isn't at all radical. The reason they keep winning seats is because nobody in Labour or the Tories can credibly run on a platform of Scotland first. If there was a genuine Scottish Tory party then they'd probably be able to win Scotland but there isn't so the SNP wins all the time.

You can tell yourself whatever you feel like to justify your western consumerist lifestyle but its a fact that the average western person does way more damage than any chinese person ever could,yet there will never be a constant barrage of attacks on those same countries doing the polluting(like there is on china or india,or just asia in general which holds half the global population) with all signs pointing that the current goverments do not intend to change much besides either either building coal plants or enslaving themselves to russia for energy.

You can feel free to brush off this post too because the numbers didn't match exactly,but get off your high horse if you don't know anything more besides whatever post was upvoted by people like you on subreddits like these where people choose to reinforce the anti china/india/3rd world narrative to make themselves the good guy in the global warming narrative.

England and Scotlands concerns are *both* merged into the United Kingdom. It's like saying Californias concerns are totally dominated by Texas concerns at the UNSC. 

&gt;If Scotland leaves the UK, the UK's actions at UNSC will not change one bit.

The UK wouldn't exist in its current form it would be the rUK, and we would take on all the obligations and rights as the legally definied successor state to the former UK.

&gt;Employees don't set foreign policy, parliament does. Those employees aren't the ones who decided to get involved in Iraq, for example.

And we've had many Scottish Prime Ministers, the last one we had was ten years ago, we also had many Scottish cabinet members and employees of the civil service.

&gt; Nuclear Power in France (Updated October 2019)

&gt; France derives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear energy, due to a long-standing policy based on energy security. Government policy is to reduce this to 50% by 2035.

&gt; France is the world's largest net exporter of electricity due to its very low cost of generation, and gains over ‚Ç¨3 billion per year from this.

&gt; The country has been very active in developing nuclear technology. Reactors and especially fuel products and services have been a significant export.

&gt; About 17% of France's electricity is from recycled nuclear fuel.

&gt; French retail prices, without major effects from feed-in tariffs for wind and solar, remain very low. In 2013 French prices for medium-size industrials were about 90% of EU-27 average, and those for medium-size households (at less than 8 c/kWh) were less than half of EU-27 average.

Wait until you learn about how stupidity expensive renewables are going to be once they provide over 60% of the energy needs. Building the first 30% is the cheapest, it's only harder from then. Let alone the battery technology that's needed but doesn't exist yet.

And I'm saying this as someone who's extremely worried about climate change.",European Federalist,/r/europe/comments/edvghj/firm_suspends_nord_stream_2_pipeline_work_over_us/fbu84wz/,CuriousAbout_This,1577109598

1252,"You're absolutely wrong. You cherrypicked one data in which america scores worse, and the one that in which it scores worse that is not directly related to quality of healthcare.

How about we look at some of the tough diseases ?

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/mortality#heading-Zero

&gt;Mortality rates for all cancers combined are projected to fall by 15% in the UK between 2014 and 2035,**to 280 deaths per 100,000 people by 2035.**

So UK expects that by 2035 they will lower their cancer mortality rates to 280 deaths per 100 000 people. Meaning right now they're higher (15% higher) at 322 deaths per 100 000 people

What are the stats for US right now ?

https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics

&gt;The number of cancer deaths (cancer mortality) is 163.5 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2011‚Äì2015 deaths).

Oh, would you look at that ? US has nearly half of mortality rate the UK has.

Almost like the US has the highest quality healthcare in the world. Oh wait, they do. 

US is paying more for far better outcomes. 

You wanna take a look at waiting periods for MRI in UK vs USA ?


https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45331220

&gt;It said a total of 87,482 people were waiting for one of the eight diagnostic tests at 30 June - of whom 18,644 had been waiting longer than six weeks.

&gt;This represents an increase of 300% on the 4,750 patients who had to wait longer than six weeks in June 2016.

You know how much of a waiting time US has ? 2-4 weeks. 

You wanna know waiting times in Canada ? They're breaking records!

https://torontosun.com/news/national/canadas-wait-times-break-new-record-21-2-weeks-fraser-institute

1327,"Nothing I have said is opinion. 

There are no internationally recognised Scottish water. There is only British water. Spin, read braveheart style articles do as you wish. This is a fact. 

There is absolutely no prospect of the UN having jurisdiction in this case except for general guidelines being followed as you mentioned the UN convention on the Sea for example meaning Scottish ships being allowed to go on their way without taxation. It has nothing to do with the actual dividing of British territory and I‚Äôm sorry but if you genuinely think that, you are far gone from any start point of a true debate as it‚Äôs not in good faith.


You said 3% is a target not a requirement. I said the Eu will impose mass austerity on Scotland until they reach 3% if they‚Äôre even allowed to join. Which was one of the main reasons people want to leave Britain to escapee austerity. Be honest and admit the austerity will be dire.

Again, you‚Äôve been pumped full of misinformation by the snp or you‚Äôve done some more half research. Britain, who controls a large section of the North Sea is an extremely important military area for the British navy. It will never ever be given to Scotland. You massively overestimate the power of the UN. Look at Israel as an example. If Britain invaded Scotland took Edinburgh they still wouldn‚Äôt do anything. 

The Ireland question isn‚Äôt opinion. I‚Äôm staying status quo. You‚Äôre stating a Christmas list to Santa. It has already been ruled that a border doesn‚Äôt breach the GFA and I‚Äôm sure you know that. Just another small untruth making what you‚Äôre saying in every regard wrong. 

I never claimed they wouldn‚Äôt get anything. I‚Äôm saying that Scotland won‚Äôt have any position to negotiate or any leeway and will be far more at the mercy of Westminster than now. 

Again you‚Äôve highlighted what parts of my points you‚Äôve deliberately misunderstood not making any real points of your own which change the simple facts I have laid out. 

Scotland will have no currency, will need devastating austerity measures, will be cut off from the rest of the world, will be open to huge tariffs, will have a hard border with England where 50+% of your trade is done, companies will flee to steady safe England in an area that will be receiving massive investment in the next 5-10 years, low corporation tax and global trade deals.

Get the refugees out or its just a matter of time before your society is going to be plagued by indifference, instability, lack of cohesion and resentment like it is here in so many parts of America. Do the birth rate math. In America, we're beginning to realize white society \[building the space stations and hadron colliders and reactors\] is basically just a favorable habitat to be used up until its destroyed for people's own gain who don't have the slightest care in the world about us and our needs. The socioeconomic dynamic (the only reason i mention reactors, etc, as it wasn't to boast) that puts white people at the top and others below \[will never end and thus\] creates a never ending cycle of resentment as everyone entering this world comes into it wanting to be on equal ground with those around them and won't have the knowledge to even see why they perhaps shouldn't be until they're well studied and older (or our societies get publicly honest), creating and endless cycle of unsympathetic, unflinching insistence on sharing all that you possess and people will get angry when you don't which will create waves of resentment and distrust from now until the end of time. And all for what? Curry? Varied skin colors around you?

I'm sure some psychopathic/sociopathic businessmen, who may barely contribute to your society, benefiting off of the increase in housing and food prices and the lowering of wages, all due to the increased competition from immigrants while protected from the chaos by their lofty estates and gated communities will miss the inflow. But obviously many more hopefully will be happy with increased buying power they have with lower rents/ higher wages that you'll see (i presume). And the blue collar workers who many of you unknowingly asked to be the ones to work a full day's labor along side people they have nothing to talk about with, who can't make each other laugh, have no stories to tell one another, don't have anything in common with, and so on, people you asked for them to exist with for longer periods of time than they will have seen their own loved ones, will hopefully get to work along side their familiar countrymen, peers, friends, neighbors, with those they're more likely to reap happiness from through the long work days, those they're more likely to have long term, healthy, rewarding relationships with. Lastly, i hope and assume your society will be resuming course towards serenity, cohesion, familiarity, peace and comfort.

1356,"&gt;There is nothing dangerous about Chernobyl-like nuclear power plants.

Yes there is? The RBMK-1000 reactors have certain design elements that make them less safe than other reactors of that time.

They have no containment building, which is primary reason why so much nuclear material was able to escape.

They have a positive void coefficient, meaning reactivity goes up if water is replaced with air bubbles for example (or if the water boils off). So if your reactor loses water, heat generation goes up. (With just about all other reactors designs the chain reaction stops if the water has boiled away. The fuel would still melt down due to decay heat)

Yes, it was primarily the operators fault that they tried to continue they tests once the reactors was xenon-poisoned.

Therefore their ultimate aim is a divisive one, to establish a government that is 'Scottish', and therefore not a liberal goal.

Their aim, their only aim, is independence.

Why not the Welsh, well they hate the English, like a lot. Wisely they have separated via language. 

The Scots. Well they're trying to separate again. And more power to them. Also they really fucking hate the English, as in the institution that's rule over a people. 

Try this little mental exercise next time you find yourself in a pickle. Pick a random country with vastly different cultural, religious and linguistic differences. Now imagine they decided to invade England, raise taxes, implement a ruling government, gave you no representation, repressed your language and literally beat anyone who spoke it. Would you rebel?

1416,"Back in the day it was still a highly painful and politicized issue as the whole war and especially the aftermath wasn't easy for a lot of finns to accept (there was some actual genocide going on).

Today it's more about Finnish pedantry than anything else. The war was complicated in that it wasn't solely an intra Finnish affair. Soviet Russia aided the reds whereas the whites gained aid from Germany. However the Soviets were perhaps more involved as they wished Finland would return to the fold and join the Soviet Union (as surely would have happened had the reds won).

While it is quite normal for other states to aid parties in civil war situations, what was special in the Finnish civil war was that both Soviet Russia and Germany were surprisingly deeply involved. The Soviets gave weapons and sent troops to fight alongside the reds whereas the Germans aided the whites by invading significant parts of southern Finland on top of arms aid. 

It needs to be said that the Soviets really wanted the Finland back. So the help the Soviets gave was directly motivated by the desire to add Finland to the Soviet Russia (or union in that case). However the Soviets were still too weak to be too directly involved as they had fought a war of their own in the recent past and were still fairly disorganized. 

On the other hand the German help for the whites was motivated more with resisting Russia and gaining resources of the Kola Peninsula.

And so while it was a civil war, it was also a power play by larger world powers over a small country and had a bit too many international nuances for the finns to call it purely a civil war.",,/r/europe/comments/ee67pw/a_sad_end_to_britain_after_the_decision_of/fbtpd2v/,theactualTRex,1577088765

That's not correct. I travel often between Madrid and Barcelona (505 km in a straight line). Before, I used to travel by plane, when a fast train line was finished between the two cities I switched to train, since it was more comfortable and faster. The flight itself lasts 50-55 minutes, the train trip 2h30m, but from city center to city center, once you count also the time to get to the airport/train station, security, check-in, board wait, etc, the whole plane trip takes 3 hours and a half, and the train barely 3 hours.

1551,"&gt;Many of the unique foods that help to make the world a diverse and interesting place are in danger. The forces of globalization, industrialization and ecological collapse threaten the wealth of culinary products that make our cultures distinct. Some of these foods are becoming rare, some are becoming much more expensive and some face outright extinction. Some have already become extinct.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cuisine is a language. Languages have two central properties, and the language of food is no different. Primarily, a language allows us to communicate, permitting us to pass on what we have learned to future generations and to other groups of humans, no matter how remote.  
&gt;  
&gt;Through language, we can trade important messages about food. Where to find it, how to prepare it and where in the forest we might want to be on guard for hungry leopards while we forage. However, each language is also a unique way of looking at the world, a point of view influenced by place and time. Each language contains concepts that do not translate easily, and if a language is lost, those ways of seeing the world are lost, too.  
&gt;  
&gt;The French idea of terroir is a good example of this. The term translates very roughly as ‚Äúthe taste of the landscape‚Äù and suggests the character of a food is intrinsically local. Terroir is shaped by climate, soil, growing techniques and processing traditions, creating foods linked to a specific land and people. Cuisines have terroir, bringing together ecology and culture to tell a story of what it is to be human.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Canada, for example, we occasionally cook with snow, using the sap of the sugar maples found only in eastern North America. Oaxaca, Mexico, is famous for its seven moles, Singapore for its chicken rice. The Scottish have their magical whiskeys imbued with brooding peatlands, smelling of wind, long train rides, cozy pubs and winter nights spent reading gothic novels. Some foods are so local that they tell the story of a single valley, river or mountain range.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/eegwgy/at_a_holiday_feast_remember_the_foods_we_lost/fbtl9bl/,CitoyenEuropeen,1577083272

&gt; **Anders dan bij veel politieke tegenstellingen heeft het huidige stikstofvraagstuk niet alleen een politiek-maatschappelijke oorsprong, maar gaat het om een belangentegenstelling die op scherp gezet is door een gerechtelijke uitspraak van het Hof van Justitie op basis van een Europese richtlijn. In deze policybrief duidt het PBL de nieuwe situatie, hoe we daar gekomen zijn en schetst mogelijke wegen om tot oplossingsrichtingen te komen.**¬† 

Translated: 

*Other then with many other political contradictions, the current nitrogen issue has not just a political/social origin, but it is a conflict of interests that has been brought into focus by a court order by the Court of Justice (the highest Dutch court) on the basis of a European directive. In this policy letter the PBL explains the new situation, how we got here, and offers possible paths to a solution.*

So, no. EU policy does override national policy in this regard. National politicians did not want to adopt the stringent EU directives, but were compelled by the court after a challenge by environmental activist organizations. I'm sorry if you were under the impression this thing could not happen - but it does. I'll not go too deeply into the meat of the specific matter other then to say that the bioindustries that get destroyed in our country, will just crop up in other parts of the world where environmental (and animal welfare) law isn't as strict.

And if you're trying to intimidate people who might consider doing the same things that you had the first guy killed for, having them be obviously the victim of homicide might well be a plus.

Plus, as the story is talking about, after some of the assassinations over the past few years, obviously some of the poisonings have been unraveling too.  True, we don't know how many there are that we haven't found.  But my guess is that there are probably now a lot of eyeballs and man-hours being put on digging them up.

And, lastly, signature chemical weapons aren't ideal if they *do* get detected.  I mean, it might be hard to trace back ""random guy with a Glock"" and prove the original source who arranged to have the person killed.  But these elaborate poisons that only a few militaries or intelligence agencies would have worked on...maybe they're harder to detect, but when they do show up, the list of suspects gets pretty short quickly.

1655,"u/Halbaras gave you a pretty biased and inaccurate reply. From a Canadian POV I think I can give you a more unbiased opinion.

**Part 1/2**

**CONS:**

* The single biggest con would be the dissolution of public services provided by the existing UK government. The biggest concern for the UK leaving the EU right now is that it will eliminate their Free Trade Agreements overnight which will cause a sudden and significant hit to the economy. Should Scotland leave the UK then you will see this but with public services like the NHS.
* Replacing these services would require a similarly strong economic baseline that exists in the UK. Scotland probably doesn't have that. They have similar GDP per Capita to the UK as it exists today but much of that is from the North Sea oil industry that's owned and operated by multinationals based in London.
* Losing London: London spends every other day swapping the title of financial capital of the world with NYC. Losing an economic asset like London would be a massive blow to Scotland's economy. There's simply no Scottish city that comes close to it.
* Loss of nuclear weapons: unlike what u/Halbaras said, Scotland would not retain the British Army's nuclear arsenal should they secede. The only case where that happened was in Ukraine when the Soviet Union collapsed and thus had no way of reclaiming the arsenal from now-sovereign Ukraine.
* Unpopularity: So far democracy has shown that Scottish independence simply isn't a popular opinion. Only 45% of Scots voted for an indy party in the past 2019 election.
* Loss of EU membership: The 45% of Scots that did vote for an indy party voted for the SNP that argues for an independent Scotland that's an EU-member. So far Scotland has not show the economic ability to successfully apply for EU membership. Scotland's national deficit is about 7x greater than the UK. They'd have to tackle their significant debt issue to apply for membership, and that would require either a reduction in public services or...
* ... raising taxes. This is the last thing an independent Scotland could afford to do. Take it from a Canadian, when you have an extremely competitive economy as your neighbour then being competitive yourself is almost a necessity to survival. Should Scotland leave the UK and then raise taxes, they'd be putting themselves in an awful position to attract private investment into their country.

**PROS:**

* Sovereignty, sovereignty, and more sovereignty. If Scotland feels they're not getting a good deal out of UK membership then they have every right to leave. The Scottish people are entitled to self-determination.
* Full control over foreign affairs, national defense, immigration laws, etc. though that ties into the earlier point of sovereignty. 
* Democratic representation. If a majority of Scottish people feel that the Labour/Lib Dems/Conservatives aren't representing their democratic wishes then that's an obvious pro. As to whether or not a majority of Scots agree with that point is a separate issue.
* FPTP politics. With 59/650 seats in the House of Commons, it's quite possible that the government of the day could choose to ignore any mandate that comes out of Scotland. As we've seen time and time again, the SNP doesn't have the size to control the UK parliament.",,/r/europe/comments/ee67pw/a_sad_end_to_britain_after_the_decision_of/fbt1luy/,iraqwarthrowaway69,1577065895

1657,"**Part 2/2**

**On the topic of military/nuclear weapons:**

* As aforementioned, Scotland would almost certainly not keep any UK Armed Forces assets should it secede. Obviously a soldier would not be forced to retain British citizenship, but the equipment they wear, the weapons they carry, and the bases they inhabit are all property of Her Majesty. The UK would likely be required to expel their military assets from Scotland, but other than that Scotland would not keep the expensive parts of the military assets they currently hold.

**On the topic of North Sea oil:**

* The first question is whether or not the UK would give up sovereignty over the North Sea oil. Obviously Scotland would have a legal claim to it, but whether or not that's actually respected without enforcement is another matter. The UK would hold all the bargaining chips in those trade relations and might make it very difficult for Scotland to control that. 
* The actual oil operations themselves are not owned by the UK government. They're owned, developed, and operated by London-based private multinational corporations like Shell and BP. They wouldn't be Scotland's to own either. 

**Why can't Scotland just nationalize the oil then?**

* Because that would be HORRIBLE for the Scottish economy. If Scotland is running around seizing private assets then foreign investment will flee the country like crazy. If Scotland would be happy operating the oilfields themselves as the backbone of their economy, trading with the few people that will trade with a nationalizing state, then go for it. But generally speaking, nationalizing is an absolutely horrible idea in the long run. 

**But Norway seems to do it and it works great for them:**

* This argument isn't valid because in the case of Scotland, they would be seizing the private assets that had been developed and operated by a separate entity. The private sector would view it as theft and a major risk and uncertainty with investing in Scotland.
* In Norway's case, the government immediately nationalized the sector as soon as oil was discovered. There was no pre-existing industry whose assets they needed to seize. The Norwegian government also handles their oil operation extremely responsibly, which is very rare among nationalized industries. Norway has also invested in a sovereign wealth fund that's helped them achieve the immense success they have today. Norway also has almost double the GDP per capita of both the UK and Scotland and should not be looked upon as a pattern.

**In terms of many of the arguments, they seem to be similar to Brexit. People don't seem as worried for the UK as they do Scotland's independence. Why is that?**

* Look at what either scenario is without the other. When the UK leaves the EU, where does that leave them? Well, it leaves them as the 6th biggest economy in the world. It leaves them as one of the single most powerful nations in terms of force projection. It leaves them with the financial capital of the world. The entire world wants access to London and the UK. There will be an immediate shrinking of the economy due to FTA's being dissolved but they will obviously be renegotiated. My country, Canada, expanded our FTA's by tenfold in the span of one premiership. If your country is important, FTA's will be relatively easy to access.
* Scotland without the UK isn't any of that. Without the UK Scotland has a smaller nominal GDP than Romania. Without the UK Scotland will either need to replace or abandon significant public services like the NHS, which will be a tremendous burden on the new economy. Scotland will have to create its own armed forces, foreign office, immigration bureau, etc. Those will be extremely expensive. 
* The overwhelming majority of Scotland's import/export is with the UK. They're going to see that shrink rapidly once they leave the UK. Unlike the UK, their economy will not be as competitive to foreign investors to rebuild this gap.
* Scotland does have a strong GDP per Capita that's right between France and Canada's ranking. That is heavily reliant on the North Sea oil and if the UK retains control of that then you will see an enormous blow to their GDP per capita. 

**In Summary/ TL;DR:**

* Basically, without the EU the UK is still an extremely formidable country. They have an enormously competitive economy, the financial capital of the world, and one of the strongest militaries on the planet. The biggest blow to leaving the EU will be the dissolution of their free trade agreements but they will almost certainly recover from that within 10 years of negotiating new ones. Basically, the UK is ""too big to fail"". 
* Scotland without the UK is simply significantly worse off relative to the UK without the EU. Rather than having to restructure their trade agreements, they're going to have to create an entirely new government. They're going to have to do that while replacing existing public services. They almost certainly won't be anywhere near as rich as the UK and those services will likely face massive cuts. They will also have to enormously reduce the public sector (bad for quality of life) or raise taxes (bad for the economy) if they want to have a hope of joining the EU.",,/r/europe/comments/ee67pw/a_sad_end_to_britain_after_the_decision_of/fbt1mhv/,iraqwarthrowaway69,1577065908

1720,"&gt; What else do you suggest should be done?

First off, I dislike the use of ""else"" here as if the UK legitimately tried the only possible strategies for creating economic dynamism in a region. The fact that they tried the same approach in the north of England and it also failed does not make that more convincing. That said, I obviously never said that I knew what specific policies should be enacted, only that they should have tried some policies that weren't ""Don't worry about developing an economy - we've got you fam"". The UK actively chose policies that made it less likely that Northern Ireland would become self-sufficient, which has led to the country we see today. If you absolutely insist, I could suggest some measures, but they would be small in comparison to a legitimate economic masterplan for a peripheral region.

&gt; Bear in mind the political realities of creating economic change.

The thing is that there aren't any actual political realities in Northern Ireland, because politics there is entirely defined by nationalism. The UK could have gone full shock therapy on Northern Ireland and there would have been no consequences whatsoever for Westminster, nor Stormont. And while it would have been extremely painful for the people of Northern Ireland, they'd likely be in a better spot for it today. The north of England is another story entirely, but Northern Ireland could absolutely have been a testing ground for experiments in developing poor regions of a country. It is, I suppose, a testament to Westminster that they treated Northern Ireland as politically relevant in this way, but it was not in my opinion to the benefit of the people.",NOT in favour of tax havens,/r/europe/comments/ee67pw/a_sad_end_to_britain_after_the_decision_of/fbt3aus/,TropoMJ,1577067166

1730,"&gt;It says a lot about both Irish and British predisposition to understatement that a 30 year civil war marked by bomb attacks, civilian massacres, arbitrary arrests and trials without jury is referred to as...


Because the British will never admit they got fucked in the ass by a bunch of grumpy Irishmen who were armed with dated hardware, while the IRA was thrilled to get 99% of what they wanted.


And even what you listed is an understatement. Both the British and the IRA were committing assassinations against each other, which culminated in the IRA *nearly* murdering Prime Minister Thatcher. The IRA also didn't really have any scruples about targets- except maybe not targeting children *intentionally*- up until they successfully bombed the funeral for police officers. 'Civilians' doesn't exactly cut it there, but once the IRA hipped the fuck up to the notion of optics they actually changed their tactics dramatically. They started looking for ways to inconvenience people in power instead of killing rando's so they hit targets of high monetary value, like banks. 


And the IRA went well beyond *bomb attacks.* The IRA would straight up kidnap people with families and then tell them that if they didn't want their wives and children to die, they'd have to drive a car to a given location. I don't need to tell you what was in those cars.

On Tuesday, December 17, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki appointed Marcin Warcho≈Ç, a close associate of Zbigniew Ziobro, to the newly created position of human rights representative.

At the same time, Warcho≈Ç, former Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Justice, was promoted.

&gt;**As the secretary of state, he can combine the function of a Member of Parliament with the tasks of a representative.** **If he remained undersecretary, he would have to give up his parliamentary mandate.**

What will his tasks be in the new position? The regulation of the Council of Ministers states that it has, among others initiate and coordinate ""activities in the field of human rights protection"" including assisting in the development of draft laws in accordance with international standards. And cooperate with the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.

There is a problem: such an office already exists. He is the Ombudsman, whose function until September 2020 is held by Adam Bodnar.

Instead of waiting for the end of the term and fighting against the unfavorable Senate for his nominee as successor to Bodnar, the government appoints Bodnar-bis. A word-for-word situation will arise: on the one hand, critical of the undemocratic actions of the Ombudsman's power, on the other not seeing problems, and by definition a representative loyal to the government.

For some public opinion, the difference between them will be so illegible that the government will be able to hide behind the ""expertise"" commissioned by Warcho≈Ç.

Warcho≈Ç himself is a perfect candidate for the government - an educated lawyer with experience of working in the Office of the Ombudsman, one of the co-authors of the PiS judiciary ""reform"" and a baked critic of Adam Bodnar.

1864,"&gt;In late May, Mr. Gebrev was released from the hospital and joined his son at the family vacation home on the Black Sea. There, the two men were poisoned again. This time, the symptoms were less dramatic and they drove themselves back to Sofia and checked into the same hospital for about two weeks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite two poisonings, Bulgarian prosecutors failed to unearth any leads or evidence. Bulgarian intelligence agencies never reported detecting a Russian assassination team in the country, and possibly never realized it had been there.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAnytime it‚Äôs linked to something with Russia, Bulgarian intelligence is very impotent,‚Äù said Rosen Plevneliev, who was Bulgaria‚Äôs president at the time of the poisonings. ‚ÄúBulgarian intelligence is not willing to counter Russian intelligence and hybrid warfare.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;When the hospital failed to determine the substance used in the poisoning, Mr. Gebrev enlisted a Finnish laboratory, Verifin, which detected two chemicals in his urine, including diethyl phosphonate, which is found in pesticides. The other chemical could not be identified.  
&gt;  
&gt;By the following summer, the Bulgarian authorities had dropped the case. They apparently had no idea that Unit 29155 even existed. Neither did intelligence and security officials in the rest of Europe.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet as Mr. Gebrev‚Äôs case remained colder than cold, members of Unit 29155 were very busy, according to partial travel records reviewed by The Times. From 2016 to 2018, operatives made at least two dozen trips from Moscow to different European countries.

1866,"&gt;**An Unexpected Breakthrough**  
&gt;  
&gt;In March 2018, a former Russian spy named Sergei V. Skripal was poisoned by a lethal nerve agent in the English town of Salisbury. He began ranting at a restaurant and fell into a coma before clawing his way back to life. It was the first recorded use of a chemical weapon in Europe since World War II, and it touched off a frantic investigation to determine the extent of the threat.  
&gt;  
&gt;British prosecutors attributed the attack to assassins working for Russia‚Äôs military intelligence agency, known widely as the G.R.U. Working with European allies, the British authorities analyzed travel records of known Russian operatives. One stood out, a man using a Russian passport with the name of Sergei Fedotov.  
&gt;  
&gt;For five years, he had traveled extensively in Europe, visiting Serbia, Spain and Switzerland. He was in London a few days before Mr. Skripal was poisoned, leaving shortly after that attack, and British authorities have now identified him as the commander of the team that poisoned Mr. Skripal.  
&gt;  
&gt;It also turned out that he had been in Bulgaria in 2015, making three visits: in February; in April, when Mr. Gebrev was first poisoned; and again in late May, coinciding with the second poisoning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Investigators from the Britain-based open-source news outlet Bellingcat have identified the man using the Fedotov alias as Denis V. Sergeev, a high-ranking G.R.U. officer and a veteran of Russia‚Äôs wars in the North Caucasus. The British authorities confirmed the accuracy of the report.  
&gt;  
&gt;The revelation that he was connected to the poisonings in both England and Bulgaria was critical in helping Western officials conclude that these were not one-off Russian attacks but rather part of a coordinated campaign run by Unit 29155.  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent weeks, another operation possibly involving the man known as Mr. Fedotov has emerged in Spain. The highest criminal court there is investigating whether Mr. Fedotov and other Russian operatives might have had some involvement in the protests that destabilized Catalonia in October 2017. Travel records show that he arrived in Barcelona a few days before the region held an independence referendum that month.  
&gt;  
&gt;During his visits to Bulgaria two years earlier, Mr. Fedotov was joined by other officers. For the April 2015 poisoning, it was two men using the aliases Georgi Gorshkov and Sergei Pavlov, according to two European security officials, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters. The man using the Pavlov identity also visited London a year before the Skripal poisoning, possibly in preparation for the attack.  
&gt;  
&gt;Armed with new evidence provided by the British, the Bulgarian prosecutor general, Sotir Tsatsarov, reopened the case in October 2018. Almost immediately, investigators discovered fresh clues. Before the initial poisoning, Mr. Fedotov and two other operatives from Unit 29155 had checked into the Hill Hotel, in the same complex where Mr. Gebrev has his office. They insisted, prosecutors now say, on rooms with views of the entrance to an underground parking garage where Emco executives kept their cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the garage, prosecutors discovered grainy surveillance video that showed a well-dressed figure approaching Mr. Gebrev‚Äôs gray Nissan, as well as the cars owned by Mr. Gebrev‚Äôs son and by the production manager. The figure appears to smear something on the handles of all three cars. Western intelligence officials have surmised that the substance was a poison.  
&gt;  
&gt;The surveillance video was described to The Times by two security officials familiar with its contents, but who had not watched it themselves. They requested anonymity to discuss a live investigation. This month, the office of Mr. Tsatsarov, the prosecutor general, confirmed the existence of the video ‚Äî but said that its poor quality prevented investigators from identifying the well-dressed figure. Mr. Tsatsarov, whose term ended on Wednesday, has sent the video for analysis by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Travel information shared with The Times shows that all three assassins with Unit 29155 left Bulgaria on April 28, as Mr. Gebrev lay in the hospital imagining monsters trying to tear him apart.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bad Arugula**  
&gt;  
&gt;There is little doubt that Mr. Gebrev‚Äôs profession ‚Äî the manufacture and sale of munitions and light weapons ‚Äî places him in a risky field, especially in Bulgaria.  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent years, the Kremlin has grown increasingly alarmed as smaller countries have nibbled away at Russia‚Äôs dominance in the arms industry. At a meeting in June with high-ranking security officials, Mr. Putin warned that Russia‚Äôs position in the industry was threatened.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúNew factors, complicating our work with our partners in military and technical cooperation ‚Äî including competitive fights and increasingly aggressive use of unscrupulous methods of political blackmail, and sanctions ‚Äî demand attention and an adequate response,‚Äù Mr. Putin said. ‚ÄúWe need to do everything we can to preserve Russia‚Äôs leading position in the world arms market.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Bulgaria now sells more than 1.2 billion euros, about $1.3 billion, in weapons annually, a relatively modest figure for the sector, but a sum that has not gone unnoticed by Moscow. Tihomir Bezlov, a security analyst, says he believes that is what made Mr. Gebrev a target.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThis is really big trouble for Russia,‚Äù said Mr. Bezlov, of the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt produce planes and tanks, but in this area of light weapons, this is serious competition.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Gebrev‚Äôs business grew out of the collapse of communism. When a scramble ensued for control of weapons factories, the new Bulgarian government blocked Russian buyers and doled out export licenses to men like Mr. Gebrev.  
&gt;  
&gt;He has since moved into areas long dominated by Russia, including the Indian market, where he describes himself as ‚Äúa niche player.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWhile Russia is exporting ammo worth billions of euros, we are exporting for millions or hundreds of millions,‚Äù Mr. Gebrev said. ‚ÄúBut never mind, we‚Äôre winning tenders and they‚Äôre dreaming and thinking that the markets belong to them.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Emco, Mr. Gebrev‚Äôs company, also made sales to Ukraine, Russia‚Äôs enemy.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the outset of Ukraine‚Äôs war with Russian-backed separatists in 2014, Emco signed a contract with the Ukrainian government to supply artillery ammunition, according to Sergii Bondarchuk, a former head of one of Ukraine‚Äôs state-controlled arms companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;After Russian protests, the Bulgarian government canceled the contract in 2015, Mr. Bondarchuk said. In a statement to The Times on Wednesday, Emco made no mention of Russian pressure but said it had unilaterally halted sales to Ukraine in November 2014. Mr. Gebrev described his contracts in Ukraine as ‚Äúpeanuts.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Gebrev was also entangled with another project that might have displeased Moscow. Shortly before he was poisoned, Mr. Gebrev tried to buy Dunarit, a large arms production plant in Bulgaria coveted by a Kremlin-backed oligarch. A secret memo written around the same time (and since made public by Bulgarian prosecutors) detailed a Russian plan to transfer Dunarit to the oligarch, Konstantin Malofeev.  
&gt;  
&gt;The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Mr. Malofeev for funding Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, Mr. Gebrev has recovered physically, though his business is still ailing. In August 2017, the Bulgarian Economic Ministry temporarily revoked his export license. The ministry is headed by Emil Karanikolov, who was nominated to his post by the far-right Ataka party, which has long faced scrutiny over its close ties with Moscow.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unlike many wealthy businessmen in Bulgaria, Mr. Gebrev has no bodyguard and prefers to drive himself. But he remains jumpy. Last fall, a surveillance camera at his home captured infrared images of a spectral figure with a mask snooping around outside.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI would be the happiest man on earth if the poisoning didn‚Äôt take place and I felt sick because I had eaten some bad arugula,‚Äù he said later. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see myself as so important that someone would try to kill me.‚Äù",Kharkiv (Ukraine),/r/europe/comments/ee49sa/how_a_poisoning_in_bulgaria_exposed_russian/fbs89cu/,Monrai,1577051619

I'd like to think you're trolling but it seems like you actually think you're making a good point with that gibberish.

Picking high paying jobs as a comparison is meaningless.

The UK average salary in 2018 was ¬£28677 (median) based on ONS figures. By having a wage that is significantly higher than the average (nearly 3x, my last post I underestimated the UK average) it means those from poor backgrounds can see the job as something they can afford to do.

In Scotland, obviously it wouldn't be simple. But there's a clearer image of what an independent Scotland would look like. Whereas with Northern Ireland, nobody really knows and nobody really wants to touch that.

Galicia‚Äôs story is a sad one in more ways than one. It is a nation of emigrants and exiles, with a combination of economic under-development and political repression creating one of the biggest diasporas of any nation, especially in Latin America, where people of Spanish descent are frequently termed ‚ÄòGallegos‚Äô due to the prevalence on the continent of those from Spain‚Äôs Atlantic coast.

‚ÄúIt was in Latin America that the most books in the Galician language were published between ‚Äô36 and ‚Äô75, not here in Galicia, because it was forbidden,‚Äù Miranda tells me. ‚ÄúThe Galician diaspora is one million people, in a country with 2.7 million.‚Äù

The vaccine has been available for free to the Cuban population since 2011.[313]¬†According to¬†Roswell Park Cancer Institute¬†CEO Candace Johnson: ""They've had to do more with less, so they've had to be even more innovative with how they approach things. For over 40 years, they have had a preeminent immunology community.""[314]¬†During the¬†thaw in Cuba‚ÄìU.S. relations¬†starting in December 2014 under the Obama administration, a growing number of U.S. lung cancer patients traveled to Cuba to receive vaccine treatment. The end of the thaw under the Trump Administration has resulted in a tightening of travel restrictions, making it harder for U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba for treatment.[315]




&gt;Challenges include low salaries for doctors,[307]¬†poor facilities, poor provision of equipment, and the frequent absence of essential drugs.[308]¬†Cuba has the highest doctor-to-population ratio in the world and has sent thousands of doctors to more than 40 countries around the world.[309]¬†According to the¬†World Health Organization, Cuba is ""known the world over for its ability to train excellent doctors and nurses who can then go out to help other countries in need"". As of September¬†2014, there are around 50,000 Cuban-trained health care workers aiding 66 nations.[310]¬†Cuban physicians have played a leading role in combating the¬†Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa.[311]",,/r/europe/comments/ee3qbc/japanese_government_study_80_of_the_worlds_most/fbqdd21/,tdzida26,1577030586

I would add that one (if not the) of the main drivers of innovation was the search for advantages on the battlefield and for exploitation (both human and nature) by the states or elites of the time. This kind of development was made in a distinctly un-academic setting, _improving_ production methods and infrastructure in typical capitalistic fashion. The greatest of these inventions enabled better exploitation of faraway colonies and overcame geography, either by reinforcing and strengthening the industrial-agrarian divide between European powers and their colonies or making distances mean less. Brunel is the poster child for Victorian engineering and while his personal efforts might have been entirely dedicated to his craft, all his projects fed the colonial-capitalist mentality of accumulation.

Note that these cooling towers have nothing to do with the nuclear part of the plant, they only cool the steam comming from the turbine to produce electricity. Powerplants have other means of cooling down the nuclear part of the plant.

####BELARUS | Russia and Belarus negotiate far-reaching administrative and economic integration. Many Belarusians, who are just starting to develop something of national pride, fear incorporation.

Steven Derix  
December 6, 2019  
Reading time 13 minutes

^Woman ^at ^the ^Kentucky ^Fried ^Chicken ^branch ^in ^the ^Belarusian ^capital ^Minsk. ^The ^relief, ^from ^1975, ^portrays ^the ^international ^solidarity ^between ^workers.

    What is the news?
    
    Russia and Belarus have not yet reached agreement on the administrative and economic integration of both countries.  
    
    Belarusian president Aleksandr Luksashenko and Russian president Vladimir Putin met each other in Sochi on Saturday to smooth
    out the final folds. But after many hours of negotiations, both parties failed to reach an agreement.
    Both presidents will meet again on December 20, in St Petersburg.

Anzjela Sjamal has argued with her old mother - so much so that the police had to be added. Now she stands before the village council of Gloesja, a fairly large village in the Belarusian countryside. In the room, behind the long table, are the police chief, the village elder, the librarian, with reading glasses on her nose and a warm woolen wrap over her shoulders. The director of the school and the doctor are also there.Mayor Maria Sushchenko takes the floor. ""You know why we invited you?""

Anzjela stares at the carpet.

""You will be fined,"" says Maria Sushchenko. ""And that while you have no work.""

""I know,"" muttered Anzjela.

""So how are we to pay that fine?""

""Mama said she is going to pay him.""

""Do you find that normal?""

""Of course not.""

""Anzjela, preventing you actually to find a paid job?""

""Well to to start: here in Gloesja you don't just find work. ""

"" Were you drunk? ""

"" Maybe a little. ""

"" Have you ever had treatment? ""

Anzjela opens her eyes:"" Am I an alcoholic?

"" Let's put it this way: several villagers have seen you drunk before. The chief of police. Myself. Maybe you need help? ""

Anzjela shakes his head:"" I won't do it anymore. ""

"" Good. If you do not need medical assistance, then we must talk about your work. Tomorrow you will report to the sewing workshop manager and ask if she can test you as a striker. If that goes well, she will take you for granted. ‚Äù

Sushchenko looks at Anzjela again carefully.

""Are you sure you're okay?""

""Sure.""

Relieved, Anzjela walks out of the village house.

""Prevention,"" Mayor Sushchenko calls these kinds of sessions. Villagers who have fallen victim to the bottle are admonished, but they are also offered a job. Official unemployment in Belarus is below 1 percent - a figure of North Korean proportions. But not everyone feels the need to register as a job seeker. The unemployment benefit in Belarus is 12 euros per month. And those who have not yet found work are employed, in the factory, the kolchoz (a collective farm) or at the public gardens department. No wonder that many Belarusians earn their income together abroad or on the black market.

Last year President Aleksandr Lukashenko signed a decree to combat ""parasitism"" in his country. If you do not have an official job, you pay a higher rate for hot water. From May next year, unemployed people will pay extra for heating and gas. People roll up their sleeves in the hallowed state of Belarus.

###Lenin Boulevard
Young Belarusians do not like to hear it, but it is hard to deny: in the Republic of Belarus the Soviet Union is still very much alive. The capital Minsk is a raked version of the ideal Soviet city: wide boulevards, immense empty squares, freshly painted concrete flats with colorful mosaic work. In the center, the Karl Marx-Allee crosses the Lenin Boulevard. In Moscow, the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the ruthless founder of the secret service, was pulled off his pedestal in 1991; in Minsk he is still standing there, among the truncated trees in the park. In Russia, the domestic security service was renamed FSB in 1991. In Belarus, he is still called KGB.

Belarus (or Belarus) was the setting for the last act of the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991. Boris Yeltsin, just elected president of the Russian Federation, concluded a secret deal with the then leaders of the Ukrainian and Belarusian sub-republics in a luxury hunting hut in the woods on the border with Poland. Belarus became an independent country - for the first time in history.

Now that independence is at stake.

&gt; ##Many Belarusians fear that their country will de facto no longer exist in such cooperation.

Last year, Moscow set Belarus an ultimatum: within a year, steps must finally be taken towards closer union of the two countries. If not, Moscow will stop the huge discounts on oil worth almost ‚Ç¨ 400 million.

Belarusian President Lukashenko cannot afford that. In recent months, Minsk and Moscow have negotiated far-reaching administrative and economic integration. The Russian newspaper Kommersant was confronted with the secret negotiating text and spoke of ""cooperation at the level of a federal state"". On Saturday, Lukayenko traveled to Russia to sign with President Putin, but after hours of negotiations there was still no agreement. A next summit is scheduled for December 20, in St Petersburg. Many Belarusians fear that their country will then de facto no longer exist.

###Subordination
This spring Lukashenko paid an inspection visit to a sovchoz (a collective state farm) in the Mogiljov region. The president was not satisfied with what he saw: rusty tractors, derelict buildings, lost cows.

""This is just Auschwitz,"" Lukashenko told the governor of the region. ""Look at that cattle. Totally subdued. ‚Äù

The governor was fired on the spot, in front of the cameras. The video was viewed on YouTube millions of times. In Russia people responded enthusiastically: a strong leader! Lukashenko received less support in his own country. Belarusians are thoughtful, almost introverted people. Many felt that their president had gone too far.

Aleksandr Lukashenko (65) began his advance in the communist party in the late 1970s. In the eighties he was at the head of various Soviets. In 1989 he threatened to be called to account for mistreatment of a kolchoz employee, but the case was dropped.

######[Image]  
^Young ^people ^in ^Minsk ^are ^looking ^for ^their ^national ^identity. ^The ^organization ^Symbal.by ^makes ^t-shirts ^with ^Belarusian ^symbols.

In 1994, three years after independence, Lukashenko was elected president. As in the rest of the former Soviet Union, the economy of Belarus had completely collapsed. With the promise of stability and restoration of soviet values, Lukashenko won the elections - the last time the poll was conducted fairly, it is said in Belarus.

In the years that followed, Lukashenko established a personal dictatorship with communist traits. The white-red-white flag of independent Belarus was replaced by the old red flag of the Socialist Soviet Republic of Belarus - without hammer and sickle. The referendum reintroduced the death penalty and abolished the maximum of two presidential terms. Lukashenko rules by decree, opposition is ruthlessly suppressed. Four prominent Belarusians have disappeared without a trace in recent years. Many suspect that they were murdered by order of Lukashenko, only a few dare to say that out loud.

""Fear has spread in Belarus,"" said Gennadi Fedynich, leader of the REP union. He receives in his office in Minsk, the only place he can be when he is not at home. Fedynich was given house arrest after a conviction for tax evasion. That case was fake, says Fedynich. According to the union leader, he is being punished for the protests he organized against ""anti-parasitism legislation.""

It is another windfall that he is not in jail. With 343 prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants, Belarus has one of the highest detention rates in Europe (the average was 134.7 in 2014) - only more people are stuck in Russia. ""According to an agreement between the European Union and Belarus, there can no longer be political prisoners. So I get house arrest - then I am not a prisoner.

2337,"The short summary is that we have nature areas with lots of biodiversity which exist as they are because they are nitrogen poor. And there are farms nearby emitting lots of nitrogen (most NH3) and thus destroying said biodiversity.

Simple solution is to simply buy up all those farms. The farmers don't want that (or perhaps not for the price offered).

Holland is a tiny country with a massive agricultural sector for export. The rules here are way stricter than for example Germany which has way more space and way more nature. Farmers use 54% of the land, contributing only 1.6% of GDP, employs only 2% of workers. Lets just buy out 1% of the farmers and then we can start building houses instead.

Of course history turned out different and it just so happened that in 1814 a Russian regiment of the allied armies liberated Koblenz from French occupation. Instead of tearing the fountain down, the Russian commander went full burn-mode and added a second inscription below:

2504,"UYA‚ÄôS COLLECTION of bongs occupies an entire bookshelf in her immaculate little flat, though she does not smoke marijuana‚Äîshe just likes the way they look. Her weaknesses, alcohol and pills, landed her in a homeless shelter in Helsinki for three years. But since 2018 she has had an apartment of her own, thanks to a strategy called ‚Äúhousing first‚Äù with which Finland has all but eliminated homelessness.

Akbar has no such luck. Last month the Afghan migrant stood in the mud of a camp outside Paris, brushing his teeth at a hose that served as a communal shower. For two months Akbar had been living in a tent city of 3,500 Asian and African migrants, hoping to apply for refugee status.

Tuya and Akbar are at opposite ends of Europe‚Äôs growing homelessness problem. Finland is the only European country where the numbers are not rising. In other rich welfare states, escalating housing costs are pushing more people into homeless shelters. In countries with weak social services, many end up on the street. And everywhere, migrants with the wrong papers fall through the cracks.

Statistics on homelessness are patchy, but dispiriting. In 2010-18 the French government doubled the spaces in emergency accommodation to 146,000, yet cannot meet demand. In Spain the number in shelters rose by 20.5% between 2014 and 2016. In the Netherlands homelessness has doubled in the past decade. In Ireland, the number in shelters has tripled. The German government estimates homelessness rose by 4% in 2018 to a record 678,000, most of them migrants. All this has thrown a spanner into governments‚Äô plans. For years, they have been trying to shift from providing beds for the night to housing-first strategies like Finland‚Äôs. Instead they are struggling to keep people off the streets.

The housing-first approach got its start in North America in the 1990s. Previously social-service agencies used a ‚Äústaircase‚Äù model: to qualify for a subsidised flat, homeless people first had to control their behavioural problems (such as addiction, petty crime or mental illness). In the meantime they had to sleep in shelters.

But being homeless makes it hard to quit drugs or crime. Shelters are often dangerous, because they are full of desperate people. Some homeless folk prefer to sleep rough, though that is risky. Street sleepers are often robbed and often get ill. When American and Canadian cities tried first giving homeless people a place to live and then working on behavioural problems, the approach saved more money on police, jails, shelters and health care than it cost.

In 2008 Finland became the first European country to embrace housing first. The number of long-term homeless has since fallen by 21% to about 5,500. (This includes those in shelters; the number sleeping rough in Finland is negligible, as they would die of cold.) Chronically homeless people were shifted from hostels to flats with contracts under their own names. They pay rent with the help of government benefits. The government saves ‚Ç¨15,000 ($16,500) per year in overall spending on each homeless person it houses. Hostels can be counterproductive, says Juha Kaakinen of Y-Foundation, the country‚Äôs biggest social-housing group: they ‚Äúcreate a kind of culture of homelessness‚Äù.

The complex where Tuya lives, run by the Salvation Army, is classified as ‚Äúsupported housing‚Äù. There are 20 staff for the 87 residents. Each flat has a kitchen, and there is a jolly communal caf√©. Social workers keep track of each resident‚Äôs problems and run work activities. Every year a few graduate to less dependent housing, but expectations are modest, says Antti Martikainen, the complex‚Äôs director. Persuading a troublesome resident to stop dropping rubbish out of the window is a win.

All this takes resources. Finland has hired hundreds of new social workers. In 2017 it built more subsidised public housing for low-income renters (over 7,000 units) than England, with a population one-tenth the size. Still, in a small, wealthy country to which few poor people move, it appears that homelessness is solvable.

Can big countries do the same? In France, the national emergency shelter hotline (number 115) gets 20,000 calls per day. Paris‚Äôs annual ‚Äúsolidarity night‚Äù, when volunteers systematically scour the city to count everyone sleeping rough, found 3,622 people in February this year.

The poor face rising rents and precarious employment, says Bruno Morel of Emma√ºs Solidarit√©, a housing organisation. Each year from November 1st to March 31st France bars landlords from evicting tenants, and this year the Paris region created an extra 7,000 temporary winter shelter places. But Mr Morel says it needs 10,000.

Another problem is the split between native homeless, for whom municipalities are responsible, and migrants, who fall under the national government. Dominique Versini, Paris‚Äôs deputy mayor for solidarity, blames the state for the migrant camps: when the city tried to set up a reception centre to house them, she says, the government blocked it. (In November it closed the camps and moved the migrants to temporary shelters farther out.)

Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist mayor, converted the reception hall of Paris‚Äôs H√¥tel de Ville into a shelter for 39 homeless women. Visiting dignitaries brush shoulders with women recovering from addiction and abuse. Ms Hidalgo has also strengthened Paris‚Äôs rent controls. The move keeps current homes cheaper but may discourage private firms from building new ones. The city is building 7500 new social-housing units a year, but Mr Morel says too few are for the very poor.

Germany is more proactive at sheltering migrants than France. But its public housing stock has shrunk dramatically: houses built with government aid can be freely sold or rented out after 30 years. Berlin, which had 360,000 social-housing units in the 1990s, now has just 100,000. Rents have doubled in the past decade. As in Paris, the city government has capped rent increases.

Europe‚Äôs homelessness problem combines two issues. Public-housing construction has slowed, and rents are rising fast, because red tape makes it so hard to build in many cities. Meanwhile, illegal immigration creates a homeless population many countries are unwilling to house. That is sabotaging the shift to housing first. France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and others have all committed to the policy. But their programmes remain a patchwork of local initiatives and pilots. ‚ÄúWhy pilot it when you know that it works?‚Äù asks Mr Martikainen, the director of Tuya‚Äôs building in Helsinki.

I give you the point of the defense spending. The military is way underfunded and underequiped. That should change. But we should not forget how big the concerns of whole Europe was in the 90s and early 00s that a reunifined germany shouldn't be militariesd. That opinion changed really fast after Trump got president. Obama, Bush and Clinton also crituced that on Germany but then Europe was okay with it.
But I think it still should be changed.

To the point everyone wanted to die in Western Germany. They wanted to defend the at this time front line against the Soviets. No one cares about the germans. Especially no one would botherd them suffering under the Soviets. The strategic point of germany was more important to them than the population. We were still the nazis at that time and not the economic power of Europe. No one wanted Germany as leader of anything. The whole eu was there to keep the germans in control by France and the UK.

This all has changed. The world order withe the west against Russians is over. The US is now open selfish. Russia sees it and trys to get the most out of it. Out of nothing everyone wants germany to lead but not say what others should do at the same time. This pipeline doesn't change much.

The main reason for this pipeline is for Germany to have more ways to get gas. And not have them through polish territory has an advantage.

Europe let itself divide by every foreign force in the last years. The Western Europe states argues who should lead the EU and the west after the US basicly left and the UK is leaving.

A couple noticeable changes though, in that the EC will, unlike the CFA Franc, not be required to hold 50% of their reserves in the Banque de France. Additionally, France will withdraw its representatives sitting in at the Banque centrale des Etats d'Afrique de l'Ouest.

Yet, the EC will conserve fixed parity with the EURO and it's guarantee of convertibility will still be assured through the Banque de France.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am far from an expert on these kind of issues, but it seems to be that the African states will keep similar benefits as before, but with less French involvement. Maybe Macron was scared that a new generation of Africans would try to get rid of the system altogether and this is kind of an early compromise ? I also read an article which states that the French distancing themselves could help with the integration of English-speaking western African countries in these types of unions. All in all this seems like a good move, Macron is being honest with the African countries and trying to build a Franco-African relationship which can look to the future without being as heavily burdened by its past. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line is that these are the type of things that are kind of hard for just random citizens to properly understand, but it seems like Macron knows what he is doing, so good on him.",France,/r/europe/comments/ee1xxx/frances_macron_announces_a_new_currency_for_2020/fbnv7el/,Gosu-No-Pico,1577003734

-

&gt; Despite their apparent rarity in the sculptural record, we know that socks (udones) were fairly common. As most people reading this will already know, socks are in fact mentioned in one of the Vindolanda letters (which also tells us that soldiers could also receive clothing as gifts from their families) and are probably shown on the Cancalleria reliefs. Socks could be made in two ways, either by being cut from fabric and stitched together or by being made by the sprang work method, which is reasonably similar to crocheting.

2715,"Yeah, its not the size of the rails that create the primary issue but there are still massive infrastructure, administrative and even political problems to actually creating most of these lines. Heck, some of them might be unsolved engineering challenges for all I know.

Just to give an example of one small section of one of these proposed lines- Beograd - Sofia - Istanbul. At the moment there is not even a way to buy a train ticket directly from Beograd to Istanbul so you have to have a 24-hour layover in Sofia so here's what your trip looks like.

1. Start at Beograd at 5:58AM and travel for 12 hours and 40 minutes to reach Sofia. Change trains or at least have some form of extended (~30 minute) layover twice along the way. Average speed: 31.5kph assuming the train doesn't run late which it often does.

2. Arrive in Sofia at 18:36 which is six minutes after the Istanbul train should have left at 18:25. In practice you could hope the train leaves late but its more likely your own train will be delayed by a few hours. So 24 hour layover in Sofia.

3. Leave Sofia at 18:25 the next day and arrive in Istanbul at 07:00 with only one layover at the border (you're getting woken up in the middle of the trip for passport checks). Average speed: 44kph

By the way there is a similar direct train from Bucurest to Istanbul but it takes 20 hours, averages 34kph and involves three actual physical train changes for the passengers. If any of those go wrong because of a train delay, you are stuck somewhere for 24 hours.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/edftf8/map_of_futuristic_transeuropean_highspeed_subway/fbng5e4/,DrunkColdStone,1576997269

You disagree? Actually a European army is a point of discussion.

We are not at war with Russia. We even do tourism. International Sport events. And trade.

&gt;The  whole moral compass while but muh petrol. I also love the only defense  being ""so we should buy overpriced American oil?!?!"" as if there's No  other country in the world that sells oil/gas. Canada, Nordic countries,  Middle East but nope it MUST be Russian!

This is about natural gas, not petrol. And as you can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_natural_gas_proven_reserves) no other country has even close to the Russian gas reserves. And available free capacities. Plus a pipeline. Thus no ships, no pollution.

There is no false argument in diversifying away from Russian gas.

This discussion is also not about the US or the US being a trading partner, as you seem to think. As I've already written, the sanctions are idealistic in nature. They're not intended to force Europe to deal with the US.

I can see that your negative views about America are too strong for you to be objective. I'm not arguing from the perspective of the US, its president, or its politicians -- I don't even live there! I'm pointing out that the idea behind these sanctions is correct. The motivation is to make Europe stronger by weakening Russia's influence. It's not about selling American LNG to Europe -- though, even if it were, it never hurts to have another source.

If you're unable to realize that Putin's Russia isn't such a great trading partner, then I fear you will see the consequences too late.",,/r/europe/comments/edohqe/nord_stream_2_to_press_on_with_europe_gas_pipe/fblxu3v/,aj_potc,1576973112

3011,"&gt;""This fact simply implies that the object produced by labor, its product, now stands opposed to it as an alien being, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labor is labor which has been embodied in an object and turned into a physical thing; this product is an objectification of labor. The performance of work is at the same time its objectification. The performance of work appears in the sphere of political economy as a vitiation of the worker, objectification as a loss and as servitude to the object, and appropriation as alienation.""

&gt;""Within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labor are brought about at the cost of the individual laborer; all means for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination over, and exploitation of, the producers; they mutilate the laborer into a fragment of a man, degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine, destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil; they estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labor process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power.""

As a result bidding for the land within the Belt is fierce and developers are able to get better loans for purchase, especially if their land banks can serve as collateral.

Housing is absolutely horrendous because of that. Britain had the worst (possibly next to Ireland) standard of housing in the old EU and among the highest prices per sq m as well as the smallest median size.

Sorry, but the original statement of the other redditor of there not being a single successful country which implemented socialism (and seriously, if there no ""means of production owned by workers"" then it's not socialistic) is correct.

Instead of reducing reliance on Russia, they want to say that whatever Putin does, even taking territory from a much weaker nation that it's okay, we will still gladly buy your fuel, Russia.. The very fuel that pays for those tanks, ships, and little green men. I'd gladly take Canadian gas even if it cost me slightly more if I were German, but their media makes it out where becoming more dependent on Russia while bolstering its regime is not only acceptable but the only solution to German energy needs.

3154,"&gt;Yes, and the TGV still holds the highest speed ever achieved by a traditional (non-maglev) train on an operational track (LGV Est).

I'm just talking operational speed - the in practice Vmax of most TGVs is 300 or 320, whereas with the shinkansen it varies wildly between series and train lines. But yes, the TGV is one way or another still the fastest non-magnetic train (excluding chinas madness).

&gt;with a evenly distributed weight due to using EMU's and having all axles powered.

To be fair, the same is true for the ICE 3 yet there is still a noticeable difference. Mainly due to Europeans not planning for maximum comfort but for maximum efficiency. The best example would be the SFS KRM, the highspeed track between Cologne and Frankfurt, which is a true roller coaster in a sense that it uses maximum steepness possible and really sharp curves while still being a 300km/h zone. There are only 3 train types with 2 of them being effectively the same series allowed to drive these, but it is the fastest connection and gets the job done. And eventhough it's purely slab and ICE3 are all axle power EMUs, the ride is ....not smooth.

&gt; unlike in France the Shinkansen crosses heavily populated areas and needs to cope with noise constraints.

This is a problem in France aswell and an even bigger problem in Germany. The Japanese compromise with tunnels, the french with rerouting the line, the Germans with slowing down.",,/r/europe/comments/edftf8/map_of_futuristic_transeuropean_highspeed_subway/fbl32vv/,LightningEnex,1576957913

At least this would be my explanation for why is there such a discrepancy of knowledge between 1991 and 1993 events.

Edit: besides that, 1993 crisis had roots in constitution and the way the new Russian federation was governed, which might be too complex and to be fair for many, needless knowledge.

The Polish side has been trying to enforce a higher transmission tariff for years in order to reduce EuRoPol Gaz's debt more quickly. However, the Russians are interested in a low wage because the Yamal pipeline transfers Russian natural gas through Belarus and Poland to Germany.

I kind of agree with you, since I did research. Before hand I thought it was bought from local people, but in fact it was bought from basically a French scavenger. 

However I find this education argument weak, as it is kind of backwards. It assumes that our today's sense of value is the ""correct and educated"" opinion, because we say so.

&gt; That's like arguing, that indigenous American people trading their artifacts made of gold for the conquistadors glass pearls were legit trades because both parties agreed...

I mostly agree with you, but those were legit trades. Just because one party makes a bad trade because of ignorance, doesn't mean it's not a legit trade.

&gt;The point is one- you have no control over what regulations exist, the person you vote in probably doesn't either.

Indirectly, you do. By voting for a government that makes the regulations. I do not even want direct input in this, since I am totally unqualified to make most of them or figure out what the proper regulations should be. I have ideas about it, but please do not put me in charge of the specifics.

&gt;Second point- It is Joe who decides whether to use state force/threats against you, not your representative.

Joe follows the regulations that are written and which I have to follow according to the law my representatives have voted for. At this point, you might as well complain the police should not be allowed to arrest people, since you have not personally made the laws and the police officer decides whether you are in violation or not.

&gt;I've already outlined what this is, offered multiple scenarios, etc.

Like I said, your argument makes no sense since you use all kinds of terms that do not fit and bring in all kinds of things that have nothing to do with it. Your understanding of government regulation is so flawed, that I don't think continuing this discussion is of much use.",,/r/europe/comments/ecrrch/airbnb_is_not_an_estate_agent_eu_court_rules/fbkkc0x/,cissoniuss,1576951685

How is that culturally swallowed though? You say that it as if it is somehow different from how other cultures changed through time and only what ""Muslims tended to do"". This cultural conversion lasted many centuries. It is believed that people started speaking mainly Egyptian Arabic about the 13th century, about 5 centuries after the Arab invasion and rule. 

That's no different from the speed of how most people in South America speak Spanish now and don't even now the language of their ancestors. It is no different from how most people with native American descent in the US and Canada cannot speak their native languages anymore. Let alone religion or culture. The situation in North America didn't even last that many centuries, though to be fair it's more that the conquerors outbred the natives, which then naturally led to assimilation, but still. It is no different how Christian Iberian powers assimilated the Muslims who were present after the Reconquista.

&gt;""Orthodox Christian in that context referred only to Serbs""

&gt;How does that sound to you?

When was *Orthodox Christian* used as an ethnonym for Serbs? Did Serbs declare themselves ethnic Orthodox Christians on censuses?

How it sounds? Completely incomparable is how it sounds.

&gt;Because every headline stated record fires, blamed bolsonaro for making the worst fires ever

Yeah, idk what news sites,tv channels you read but NOT every news channel blamed bolsonaro stop victimizing yourself or bolsonaro


 &gt;and saying because of it he would destroy the amazon and that would cause humam extinction since the amazon is important for climate change, which is the issue causing our extinction.

No one said that it would lead to pur extinction again stop victimizing,  but nonetheless amazon forest IS important to climate and IS affected by climate and it will be bad repercusion  for everyone if it's size became smaller


&gt;The truth is that the fires werent any different, have been worse, bolsonaro actually acted against the fires with success and the amazon has little to no impact to the climate change.

Hmm who do i choose to belive? A random brazilian on the internet who clearly support and share the ideas of a guy who deny climate change or thousands of scientists and experts who have some actual research and knowledge in the field, yeah we all know how good the bolsonaro acted the entire world calling him and brazil authorithies out and threaths of santions are the perfect proof to support this statement


&gt;I only talked more in depth about the fires and bolsonaro because you did. Most people here dont accept the fact that the fires happen all over the world, have been worst in other countries, and that developed countries are far worse for the climate than brazil ever has been.

And you choose to talk in depth ONLY about bolsonaro and not about the other 3 statements i did regarding why the australian bushfire or in your case ""rainforest fire"" dont get as much attention as the amazon ones

&gt;Developed countries worsen climate change, climate change worsen fires all over the world, including australia, australia is burning in record rates and... reddit is silent, little to no headlines about it, no dozens of threads created about it every day.

Idk what subreddits you use but you missed the shitstorms of threads when they announced that bcuz of these fires koalas are functionally extinct only today i saw 3 or 4 posts in the front page regarding this subject , just bcuz you dont see them dosent mean they are not


 &gt;And my arguement is, the only reason people even spoke about the amazon was because brazil tried to close the mercosur deal with the EU and some countries didnt want that competition, so they flooded social media with bullshit and you all ate it up, along with the left that lost political power who used it as ammunition.

Yeah mate sure we are all indoctrinated by the western media and you and you Bolsonaro messiah are our salvatiom right? This is the reason we cared so much abput brazil not bcuz the biggest rainforest on the earth was on fire, not bcuz it was mainly of human cause, not bcuz ppl were outraged and disgusted about how poorly and bad the brazilian authorithies acted, WE WERE INDOCTRINATED BCUZ BRAZIL TRIED TO CLOSE THE MERCOSUR DEAL 

&gt;There are a lot of opinion articles like the one you posted, very few actual facts backed with evidence on them. 


You sound like ""a lot of these articles are lies"" hmm ppl idolizing them in despite of the numerous corruption scandals smells like someone got exposed to a little bit to much propaganda 

&gt;I asked about corruption, you gave back something completely different, and thats how you operate.

You asked about corruption i told to check the CPI (corruption perception index)  ,and just write bolsonaro corruption,  or brazil corruption and what you get  ? Right corruption scabdals regarding him,his cabinet or his family, is pointless to gave you examples when there are so many that you can see yourself and  is pointless  it will not change you view on him ,his dick is to deep in your throath to see that he os not the messiah you consider him

REGARDING THESE LAST POINTS , save yourself some time dont write me an essey of why i am wrong regarding the second reincarnation of Jrsus Christ known as Jaor Bolsonaro bcuz like i mentioned before the point of these argument is not brazil politics and why the media reacted so different regarding the amazon rainforest fires and australian bushfires

&gt;PS.: You write like a mumbling child, its very hard to take your wall of text seriously.

What are you even talking about here. Uber is now an oversight service? What?

&gt;Do you know how many regulations and employees the FAA has?! And guess what, they didn't provide a good service as people were killed. So how do you fire the state regulatory service? Answer: you can't.

Yes, they failed, because they let Boeing itself do most of the work on it all. Which clearly went wrong, so they need to do it themselves and not trust the corporations when they say things are OK.

Do you think that if Boeing was allowed to 100% regulate themselves there would have been no issue?

&gt;But if you don't like Uber's regulatory services you can use Lift, or some other company.

FWIW, most Shinkansen are actually slower than the TGV. But the thing is, France uses standard track design for their high speed trains which means a cheaper building cost but a bumpier ride. Shinkansen drive on a slab design which is much smoother and the way the lines are set up are to ensure maximum smoothness during the ride. This is purposefully not done in France and Germany as it exacerbates building costs and building inconvenience for little gain.

3523,"Absolutely ludicrous argument.

The UK being a member of the EU for decades, being a key player with developing the customs union, it's rules and regulations vows to leave said customs union under full knowledge that the very union they helped develop requires border control checks and then plays the victim card.

There's one of two possibilities here - either the British government in all of it's entirety somehow were unaware the customs union needs to be sealed or, and in my opinion much more likely, they simply did not care about the threat of a border in Ireland so went ahead with their plan. Now with Boris selling the unionists of NI out and putting a border down the Irish Sea for the first time in centuries it reinforces the second reason.

Another reason why that argument holds absolutely no water is the fact that the UK knew the EU would implement border controls yet were still willing to go ahead. If they had went ahead it would not have been Dublin who would suffer, or Cork or Galway. No. The violence and smuggling was never there. It was in the border counties. It would have been Derry, Fermanagh, Tyrone &amp; Armagh. How many people were killed in Cavan, Monaghan or Donegal? Next to no one. If the EU threatens border controls then NI's apparent government in London should have defended it instead of just saying ""oh we won't put up controls so it's ok"".

The organization's mission statement is ""To identify challenges and opportunities likely to affect American security"",[7] where main activities are focused on exposing and researching what it believes to be jihadist threats to the United States; a number of these beliefs have been widely discredited, such as its false claims about American ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. The CSP has been criticized by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, among a wide variety of other media and research organizations, for propagating conspiracy theories and Islamophobia, and described as a hate group.

&gt; While the returns may be very great, they're also very slow.

The problems is that even existing NPP's don't generate ""great returns"". In the USA a third of all NPP's is operating at a loss. The economics of NPP's are a mixed bag at best.

There's, of course, ways around that if we really want to. That would require a clear EU commitment and long-term strategy. Standardization could potentially significantly decrease financial risks. [source](http://publications.tno.nl/publication/34627557/x1eQo8/TNO-2018-P11577.pdf)

Note that many publications assume a 90%+ yearly load factors for NPP's. In reality, very few NPP's achieve that number and lifetime load factors are significantly lower. Speaking broadly, forecasting profitability f NPP's is very hard due to lots of financial uncertainties. That uncertainity alone makes NPP's unattractive.

&gt; They are viable but have such a huge upfront cost and build time that they only become profitable after about 10yrs of operation. From then on they‚Äôre money printing machines for the next 20yrs. (Source u/ShootingPains)

3873,"This being Tolkien, I imagine that someone's done an etymology.

*googles*

Yup.

http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Riddermark

*Riddermark* means ""land of the riders"", derived from the Old English compound Riddena-mearc (""riders' mark""[2] or ""The Territory of the Knights""[3]). [Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_\(territory\)) here is used in the sense of ""borderland, especially one serving as a defence of the inner lands of a realm"".[1] 

*March* is a link to the WP article on [*March (territory)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_\(territory\)):

&gt;In medieval Europe, a *march* or *mark* was, in broad terms, any kind of borderland, as opposed to a notional ""heartland"". More specifically, a march was a border between realms, and/or a neutral/buffer zone under joint control of two states, in which different laws might apply. In both of these senses, marches served a political purpose, such as providing warning of military incursions, or regulating cross-border trade, or both.
&gt;
&gt; Just as counties were traditionally ruled by counts, marches gave rise to titles such as marquess (masculine) or marchioness (feminine) in England, marquis (masculine) or marquise (feminine) in France and Scotland, margrave (Markgraf i.e. ""march count""; masculine) or margravine (Markgr√§fin i.e. ""march countess"", feminine) in Germany, and corresponding titles in other European states. 

Hmm.  In fact, I think I remember Tolkien using ""marches"" somewhere else in that sense in the books.

*googles again*

Yeah.

*The Fellowship of the Ring*:

&gt; Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond the western marches.

-

&gt; Outside the Farthings were the East and West Marches: the Buckland (see beginning of Chapter V, Book I); and the Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1462.

-

&gt; The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor.

*The Two Towers*:

&gt; 'And it might draw other things, neither Orc nor Hobbit,' said Aragorn. 'We are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor Saruman. Also we are on the very edge of Fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it is said.'

-

&gt; 'You speak justly, lord,' said the pale man sitting upon the steps of the dais. 'It is not yet five days since the bitter tidings came that Th√©odred your son was slain upon the West Marches: your right hand, Second Marshal Of the Mark. In √âomer there is little trust. Few men would be left to guard your walls, if he had been allowed to rule. And even now we learn from Gondor that the Dark Lord is stirring in the East. Such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return. Why indeed should we welcome you, Master Stormcrow? ""L√°thspell"" I name you, Ill-news; and ill news is an ill guest they say.'

-

&gt; So they passed into the northern marches of that land that Men once called Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling streams.

-

&gt; And they became our allies, and have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need, and guarding our northern marches and the Gap of Rohan.

*The Return of the King*

&gt; 'Verily,' said Denethor. 'And in my turn I bore it, and so did each eldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing of the kings, since Vorondil father of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw in the far fields of Rh√ªn. I heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen days ago, and the River brought it to me, broken: it will wind no more.' He paused and there was a heavy silence.

3924,"&gt;California has spent billions on a rail project linking LA and SF, when completed it will take longer and be more expensive than service from LAX and SFO.

That's true to practically any flights going above 100km in distance. Even with check-in, security, etc, travelling 250km by train is longer than flying.

The point here is not reducing the time of travel below what it would take to fly, but to offer a more comfortable way to get from e.g. London to Budapest (usually a 3 hour flight, and a day and a half by train as connections are shitty and expensive) in 4-5 hours (a TGV/Bullet train style system that can do the roughly 1500km at 320-400kph sustained speeds.

Not to mention that such system in Europe makes sense - it's much more densely populated, meaning distances between cities and even countries are lesser than within the US' cities and states. It's an ongoing joke that by the time you get to a state border in the US, you've already crossed two countries in Europe.

&gt;Anyways a huge reason US moves so much freight by trains is because of coal, the US freight network is far inferior to say Switzerland, where 30% of freight is moved by train.

Wrong. [The U.S  consumes 680 million short tons, or 619 million metric tonnes, of coal.](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/use-of-coal.php) Meanwhile, the E.U. [consumes 596 million metric tonnes.](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Coal_production_and_consumption_statistics)

I agree with every point you've made in your last comment, my comments were there to bring the Baltic perspective into the conversation, in total we're just 6 million people and we are fully aware of that. It's just really frustrating to hear generalized statements about countries 'in the east', because politically we do not align with the Polish and Hungarian positions at all.

I'm waiting for a shift in the German political structure in order to achieve some of those cultural connections you're talking about. CDU/CSU politicians and voters care only about money and they see no difference between the Baltic states and the other countries. SPD is just pathetic and spineless these days, and I'm saying that as a left-wing person. Die Linke is a joke since they'd be the first ones to sell off the Baltic states to Russia just to please their Russia = communism (lol) = good fantasies. So I'm hopeful the greens can be more future and EU-oriented.

And you're right, the pipeline being built through Lithuania wouldn't be enough to spur Germany to defend Lithuania, but it would be another reason to do it, and that's good enough.

4040,"I definately grew up hating Turks. However it was not because I was taught that way. It was by experience. Like many places in Germany I grew up in a city with a large Turkish population. 90% of the time I was in any way bullied as a kid/juvenile it was by Turks. It was literally something Turkish juveniles did for fun. Like one of their favorite set ups was to send 2-3 younger kids ahead to annoy us Germans while hiding in the vicinity. They'd insult us, spit at us or do whatever it takes for us to do anything to provoke the older ones to go at us. The reality is that your people came to our country for work, stayed and brought up kids without any respect for the country they were living in. 

What I hear a lot from our domestic Turks is how they've gotten no chance to integrate. I'll be fair and say this is partially true because we really had no idea how to deal with a large population of people of a very different cultural background. At the same time however I have to say a lot of you simply didn't want to integrate and still don't want to. I've seen Syrian refugees living here for a year with better German than some 3rd to 4th generation German Turks. How is that even possible?

So, even if it were true that the UK could eventually find itself slipping into a position (politically or economically) that it couldn't extricate itself from with regards to its relationship with the EU (even though such being a concern should've been rendered moot for the UK by the various British vetoes &amp; opt-outs which you seemingly hate, even though they accomplish the UK's two-fold goal of obtaining EU benefits without any of the downsides, i.e. Britain having its cake &amp; eating it too), such would be the result of the UK's own political processes resulting in a government choosing to slip into said position.

In other words, saying that the UK needed to leave the EU before it got to the point where it would have no other choice but to leave the EU is a pointless tautology, &amp; arguing that it's right to leave the EU on the basis of retaining sovereignty, such that doing so prevents a future British government from choosing to strengthen the UK's ties to the EU, is, similarly, logically backward.",,/r/europe/comments/edb13x/mps_back_johnsons_brexit_bill_358_to_234/fbi83bg/,brucejoel99,1576893472

4121,"&gt; Lmao imagine unironically citing Fischer.

Fischer merely started the trend of questioning the Versailles narrative. Unless you have better and more well academically regarded sources than let's say, Sally Marks's the Myth of Versailles or Richard Evans trilogy. I would suggest toning down on sarcasm.

Even the ""pop history"" cesspool that is wikipedia changed its article on the treaty to better reflect the modern historical consensus on the subject.

&gt; The fact that you think the 1918 German Revolution and Spartacist Uprising had nothing to do with the rise of Weimar Germany and then NatSoc Germany is patently laughable.

I have never implied that but even that is not the reason. The roots of Nazism were there even before these events, or even the hyper-inflation crisis of 1921-1923 with the Dolchtosslegende. More so than misery, it was the fact that the civilian population did not witness the defeat, Germany having been neither invaded, bombarded or forced to capitulate before an armistice was signed.

Treating Germany ""well enough"" so that its people did not push for revenge was impossible unless the Entente powers agreed to sign a treaty in favor of Germany. With the amount of press control possible at the time and the apparent absence of a ""legitimate"" defeat in the eyes the German public, anything harsher than a status quo would have been regarded as a Diktat backed by treasonous elements of society. 

A magnanimous victory wasn't possible because of how delusional the German people was about the situation, and by attempting to enforce a ""moralist"" treaty, the Entente powers shot themselves in the foot. An armistice requried a harsh peace, only a full capitulation obtained on German soil could have opened the eyes of the German people and made a lenient peace geopolitically viable.

Rabid anti-communism and antisemitic behaviours were already the norm for German soldiers holding the eastern territories obtained after the treaty of Brest-Litosvk and those very same soldiers would then go on to become the core of the freikorps involved in the events you mentioned. 

As for the financial aspects of Versailles, Germany recovered quite fast after Rudolf Havenstein's death and the cessation of self-sabotaging inflationist policies aimed at denying France reparations and forcing the UK/US back to the negotiation table. 

Once Hjalmar Schacht got in charge in 1924, the country started recovering in earnest and all of Keynes predictions fell appart, there was no collapse of steel &amp; coal production, but an increase to beyond pre-war levels. Similarly, the German merchant fleet quickly expanded to become one of the largest in the world and it is only through the Wall Street crash that this period of economic boom was brought to a halt. And this was the period when Germany paid the most reparations.

With the treaty getting subsequently revized in favor of Germany twice before all payments being finally ""postponed indefinitely"" by 1932, before Hitler's election. The notion that Versailles was the deciding factor behind the success of the NSDAP is sketchy at best even though it was indeed heavily exploited for propaganda. Unless treated like a victorious nation whose soldiers had never been defeated (as was implied by the very first Weimar President: Friedrich Ebert in his speech welcoming Soldiers home) or thoroughly defeated on the field of battle, Germany would have backed revanchism on the ground that the defeat ""was a foreign plot"" anyway.

Ultimately, out of the chimeric 132 billions demanded, Germany paid barely 20 while its leadership had proposed to pay 50 cash without further ties during the initial negotiations.",France,/r/europe/comments/ed7mmh/1915_english_soldier_in_france_with_the_rising_sun/fbia4bw/,GeistHeller,1576895121

Those Kurds voting for him and his men are those who are either forced through political oppression or convinced by other means, like the fully controlled media convincing them they represent Kurds or if they don't vote for AKP things gonna get worse (literally what they campaigned with). Corruption is huge in Turkey and it plays a part.

4161,"What he gains from it directly is unclear. My best guess is that it's an indirect win. Basically, a lot of political groups on the extremes of the political spectrum have ties with Russia, directly or indirectly. In the past, it used to be the far-left when the Soviets were around, now it is the far-right. That last group uses a rhetoric based heavily on nationalism, protection of ""Christian/European values"" (whatever that is supposed to mean in their eyes, I'm not sure), strong conservatism on the social and ethical level and most of all, leaders that seek to appear as strong men/women.

Putin is the epitome of that, especially that last part, and serves as an example or support for those group. For example, when Putin says or does something that they agree with, they can use him as support of sort for their argument. This in turn reinforces parties on the more extreme parts of the spectrum who are notoriously difficult to work with, which in turn sows discord amongst Western democracies which are, at the very least, rivals.

I guess that's his angle here: not to reinforce himself or even his country but weaken others. And then sometimes, it works even better than expected and you have Trump. In this case, there was one moment, after the infamous child refugee prison affair, where Putin made a comment about the fact it was barbaric and would not happen in Russia. For those specific occurrences, he gets to do some whataboutism when asked about his own human rights record but I'm assuming that's the additional advantage of the process, not the goal itself.

Concerning your last point, there are some decent apps available, that don't incorporate all trains yet, but it should come over time.

[citation needed]

&gt;That's why you don't use nuclear to load follow (even though it can), you use hydro and in very exceptional cases gas. Lately nuclear has been used to load follow in France because it was made mandatory to absolutely use whatever the intermittent was outputting. This is an idiotic idea, but what can I say.

They say:

&gt; Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom.

It's complicated because of stuff like this:

&gt; No customs duties shall be payable for a good brought into Northern Ireland from another part of the United Kingdom by direct transport, notwithstanding paragraph 3, unless that good is at risk of subsequently being moved into the Union, whether by itself or forming part of another good following processing.

Goods are 'at risk' unless they're not going to be further processed in NI and also fit some criteria not yet established. There's then a big list of bits of EU law which apply in NI.

There's then this 'democratic consent' thing which can disapply part of this through some sort of NI vote.

As far as I can make out there is both a sea border and an RoI/NI border. Tariffs may be applied as goods go from GB to NI if they're at-risk of entering Ireland, then refunded if they can be shown not to have done. However, goods made in NI and exported to Ireland are obviously also going to be subject to EU tariffs (and vice versa).",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/edb13x/mps_back_johnsons_brexit_bill_358_to_234/fbhpofg/,xelah1,1576879417

4383,"&gt; A taxi company does not always own all the cabs. A hotel can be run for someone owning the building.
    
What's the argument? 
     
&gt;Regulations are not run by the state.
    
So there are no regulatory agencies? In the US here's a list of them:
   
[https://www.einvestigator.com/federal-regulatory-agencies/](https://www.einvestigator.com/federal-regulatory-agencies/)
    
And yes, they enforce regulations, they also have wide ranging powers to create more regs. 
    
&gt;for the people that vote for that government
   
What regulation have you voted for? What regulations has the person(s) you voted for voted for? What are the exact rules in each of these regulations? 
   
Respectfully, your statement isn't supported. People have essentially no control over what regulations exist, what new ones will be created, etc. 
   
Additionally, state bureaucracies have very little oversight, this is often what people describe as the deep state. The vast majority of state employees aren't elected, or even appointed by elected employees, but just hired as with any other organization. So Joe, your neighbor, could easily be the person who decides whether you should be fined for not complying with some ambiguously worded regulation. And the vast majority of business can't afford compliance employees or expensive private regulatory compliance services. 
   
&gt;And no, you haven't explained how those state employees - that check if regulations are followed - are competing with private business.
   
Once more- Uber:
   
-Driver
   
Background checks
   
Credit checks
   
Personal information- personal address, phone, etc. 
   
Car- maintenance, car type
    
Plus the company also provides client/passenger regulatory service for drivers
      
Driver/passenger interaction history
   
Then Uber also provide dispute resolution for drivers and passengers (this would is in competition with state civil courts). 
   
Etc. 
    
&gt;There is no competition here, there is oversight.
   
There's direct competition and Uber is an oversight service provider as listed above. 
     
&gt; Which in the worst case leads to people dying (for example, Boeing recently, where the checks they followed safety regulations were not checked properly by the state but mostly left to the company itself).
   
Do you know how many regulations and employees the FAA has?! And guess what, they didn't provide a good service as people were killed. So how do you fire the state regulatory service? Answer: you can't. 
   
But if you don't like Uber's regulatory services you can use Lift, or some other company.",,/r/europe/comments/ecrrch/airbnb_is_not_an_estate_agent_eu_court_rules/fbhes97/,stupendousman,1576871940

I personally had reservations, because it was clear that the referendum result was a fluke and that a repeat of it would have resulted in remain getting slightly over 50%. Jacob Rees-Mogg confirmed this in an interview as the reason why he's against a second referendum, which is highly undemocratic in my book. It was a predecided outcome, since that's what benefits the people paying the politicians.

Anyways, with the Brexiteers taking over power in the UK, there was no way to avoid a Brexit, since everything was skewed to benefit them in some way. The Tories getting 43.6% is a clear mandate to do whatever they want with the country. So, I conclude that the UK citizens deserve whatever's coming for them now.

4826,"Look, Great Britain¬¥s voting population basically is fucked to never actually know what is going on in Europe. The media enviroment is completly bonkers when it comes to reporting EU issues. 

That starts with the migration-issue, both inside the EU and internationally with the recent refugee crisis. 

When the opening of the labour market was declared, the EU nations agreed that there would be a transistorial period during which each nation could slowly open its labour market, but Tony Blair decided to throw open the floodgates right away. Did this matter? Not a fucking bit. The whole thing was the EU¬¥s fault.

Then came the migration crisis during which Great Britain was literally excempted from accepting anyone and absolutely free to chuck anyone who managed the channel crossing back to whichever nation was willing to let them disembark from an international flight. Still, once again the EU was going to flood them with foreigners.

Another thing was the whole spiel about taking back control and sovereignity and such. You can kiss that goodbye if you want to participate in the common market as a Non-EU member. The media could literally report that the swiss Parliament repeatedly stated that they don¬¥t have the man-hours to even pseudo-democratically rubber stamp the regulations coming out of Brussel and Strasbourgh, but they didn¬¥t care to. A central slogan of the leave-campaign being checked on its reality-basedness is apparently not relevant to the british news cycle.
Let¬¥s not even talk about the obvious future issues of being a medium-sized nation trying to get leverage in international trade while China and the US are playing hardball.

Like there would be nothing wrong with wanting to leave, the right to it is literally granted by EU treaties after all, but I think I have a right to be mad about them leaving after having been lied to for two decades and multiple election campaigns.

&gt;The disdain for democracy and the blocking of the right of the common people to effect change.

Once again, the EU is an union of sovereign nations. Power transfers to Union institutions are limited by the literal text of the treaties, which furthermore have a really high treshold for changes being enacted on them. This safeguards the sovereignity of the member nations.
A further democratization of the union to the point where Parliament can change EU treaties to fix actual glaring issues on its own would trigger a rapid loss of sovereignity in the member states. You can¬¥t have your cake and eat it here, no matter which way you try to slice it.

Plus right now, the existance of the EU High Court has actually brought significant improvements to the common people as it created an additional, automatic layer of checks and balances to national fuckery. There is no member state that doesn¬¥t have some glaring defect somewhere in its system of checks and balances, so having at least one actual independant court with actual power is insane. This is somewhat acceptable as the court¬¥s power is still formally limited by the content of treaties and regulations, even though court members do have stated that they will be trying to over-reach whenever possible or even when given half a chance.",,/r/europe/comments/ecbm9k/eu_ministers_opt_to_continue_overfishing_despite/fbgbicw/,Kakanian,1576843752

Hahaha cost effective infrastrucuture... A staggering amount of important infrastructure problems in Germany get canceled because they aren't cost effective. Those that have been recalculated until they become cost effective become financial catastrophes that take ages to build (World Conference Center Bonn, Berlin Airport BER, Stuttgart Central Station S21).

While under american occupation, a plan was formed on how to properly connect Germany once reunified: Verkehrsprojekt Deutsche Einheit. The full resolution after reunification in 1990 included 17 infrastructural things to be built. 1990. 29 years ago. 9 of those 17 projects have been completed. 3 of them have only been completed in a strongly reduced manner. 5 of them still remain incomplete or haven't even been begun to build.",,/r/europe/comments/ecydrs/the_municipality_in_green_madrid_has_the_same/fbgbwh9/,LightningEnex,1576844199

We usually assign children a sex of either male or female based on characteristics like genitalia when they are born. However, while ""male"" and ""female"" are general categories that roughly fit the majority of people, there are a lot of complicating factors - things like chromosomes and hormone levels - that impact how our bodies work much more than what our genitals look like. So while these categories may be useful in some circumstances, they are insufficient in others.

Gender is based on how people perceive themselves. Imagine that you suddenly found yourself in the body of someone of the ""opposite"" sex - you would still have an internal idea of yourself based on how you felt before the switch. If we figured out how to put human brains in robot bodies, those brains would most likely still think of themselves as having a gender.",,/r/europe/comments/ecya18/jk_rowling_faces_backlash_after_tweeting_support/fbg5n4k/,jglitterary,1576835663

Scotland is it's own country and independence is the normal position for a country.

&gt;I don't think anyone would be a against it if Belgium would willingly agree to unify with France (which is what happened in 1707 when the Scottish parliament dissolved itself and the United Kingdom of Great Britain was formed).

Educate yourself on this please. The public had no say in the acts of union and were overwhelmingly against it.

&gt; The thing is that there wouldn't be a different results in the second referendum. 1.2 million Scots voted for the SNP on this election, that's 200k less than in 2015 when the SNP received the highest number of votes and it was the year when Independence lost by 10%.

The most controversial part were said ""rainbow Fridays"", because during the lectures kids were supposed to be ""sexualised"". Because there was a fragment in which parents were encouraged to introduce their kids in age of 0-4 to ""joy and pleasure of touching their own body, masturbation in the period of early childhood"".

The QOF isn't an actual calculated indicator, so I'll use the closest term to it, that is the HDI, Human Development Index, which takes in account the factors that people would informally include in QOF (Healthcare, Economic Stability, Social Security, etc) as given by the UN. DK's HDI is of 0.930, whilst Spain sits at 0.893, which means that there is a 0.037 diff between them. They both are in between the top 25 global. 

I'd also take in consideration how different both economies are; Spain's GDP is 4,05 times DK's, mainly because DK's economy is a small but very specialised economy, whereas Spain focuses more on global export and services, especially tourism.

5285,"To do a full explanation would take to long so I will briefly answer your questions.

&gt;Can any Germans explain to me what are the long term goals of the German government geopolitical strategy? 

Germany doesn't really have a geopolitical strategy beyond wanting to be Switzerland 2.0. That this doesn't work for the economically largest and most populous country of Europe doesn't need to be explained.

&gt;Germany acquired an unprecedented amount of soft power through its economic domination of the European plane. But it seems it lacks a proper long term strategy. It seems like they do not know what to do with all that soft power.

Germany didn't have an independent foreign policy until the 1990s when the pressure of the Cold War wore off and for the first time in history the German Bundeswehr was used militarily abroad. Before then the German military was solely defensive and German foreign policy practically all NATO and EU. In the EU Germany pressed for economic liberalisation while at the same being obedient to defend and meet NATO expectations, which were admittedly little as NATO didn't want to arm Germany too much. After NATO supremacy in foreign policy weakened Germany pressed onwards with EU expansion and economic integration but never developed a comprehensive foreign policy beyond that.

&gt;But our shared European future depends on what Germany does. I am not sure if it's because of historical guilt or some cultural reasons but it seems that it is so hard for Germans to be bolder and less pragmatic. Pragmatism is usually good but not always.

Germany is not pragmatic but indecisive. Germany as a society looks inwards and does not want to take actions on the international stage. Like in the Cold War they want to sit on the sidelines. That's why Germany denounces and complains about other countries actions but never does anything of note in the various international political stages. 

Now to a not so friendly conclusion: To put it bluntly Germany as a society does not want to lead. WW2 has taught them that Germany should never lead again, even in good faith mistakes can be made and damage can be done. That's too much of a risk. Instead Germans look inwards and try to defend their post-war ideals of pacifism and shrewdness from themselves while ignoring the outside world. In the current times Germans don't even have to change as they are comfortable to an idiotic degree and any change is bad change. The German government and society retain their idea of a 0% deficit which at this point makes the national infrastructure decay, the public currently causes the German wind energy industry to collapse as they double project lengths of all parks, the army is a mess and has been a mess for decades with the German army needing tens of billions ‚Ç¨ in investment to come to a marginal standard and finally the country is constantly trying to cuddle up to every major power to increase economic gains although some of those power actively want to hurt Germany.",√ñsterreich,/r/europe/comments/ecsokc/emmanuel_macron_isnt_gaullist_hes_just_angry_at/fbfdonv/,RedKrypton,1576808051

5411,"&gt;On the matter of nuclear waste, I think that you are completely wrong. Nuclear waste is near trivial to deal with because it's nowhere near as harmful as you think it is, and because there's so little of it, and because it's so easy to deal with.

And if it turns out you were wrong, you'll be long dead anyway. That makes it not an acceptable issue to say ""okay, I'll let you take the risk"": because most of the costs are public and in the future. This becomes particularly problematic if the ""you"" is a company profiting of the whole thing.

&gt;Again, for clarity, you are not completely wrong on the matter of reactor accidents. Yes, it could plausibly involve the evacuation of an area for a year, or a decade, or maybe a few decades. Having said that, do note that the emerging consensus of health physicists, aka experts in radiation damage to human health, is that most people evacuated during Fukushima should not have been evacuated at all, and that the evacuation produced worse health outcomes. Also, even if it happened once a decade, and I don't think it will, it'll still be less bad than global warming.

And yet, if it happens, then for example in Belgium that would mean the evacuation of a million people, a big city downwind, and the most important harbor.. That's 10% of the population and 15-20% of the economy displaced and stopped. Really not an acceptable risk to me. Neither is ""let's not evacuate and hope for the best"". So this whole thing goes a bit beyond our ability of humans to realize.

&gt;Regarding solar and wind. Solar cells and wind turbines could be free and it still wouldn't be good enough. The price of solar cells and wind turbines is not the major stumbling block. The major stumbling block is everything else. Primarily, it's the cost of dealing with their intermittency. However, the cost of transmission lines is also very large. The cost of providing synthetic grid inertia should not be ignored either.

There are actual and potential solutions for all of those things. Renewable capacity will grow gradually, so we can observe what happens and implement the solutions gradually too. In Germany the percentage of renewable energy is already much higher than what was thought possible even just 10 years ago.

As it is, my top priority is that the presence of the nuclear sector doesn't slow down the pace with which renewables displace fossil fuels. We'll see who wins then.

5636,"""If the divergence between different European economies is so great that even the ERM cannot contain them, how would those economies react to a single European currency?
The answer is that there would be chaos of the sort which would make the difficulties of recent days pale by comparison.

Huge sums would have to be transferred from richer to poorer countries and regions to allow them to take the strain. Even then unemployment and mass migration across now open frontiers would follow. And a full-fledged Single currency would allow no escape hatch.

The political consequences can already be glimpsed: the growth of extremist parties, battening on fears about mass immigration and unemployment, offering a real ‚Äî if thoroughly unwelcome ‚Äî alternative to the Euro-centrist political establishment.

If in addition you were to create a supra-national European federation, and the people could no longer hold their national parliaments to account, extremism could only grow further.

It is time for the European politicians to sit up and take note. Time to stop their endless rounds of summits ‚Äî summitry is fast becoming a substitute for decision-making ‚Äî and observe the reality around them.

There is a growing sense of remoteness, an alienation of people from their institutions of government and their political leaders. There is a fear that the European train will thunder forward, laden with its customary cargo of gravy, towards a destination neither wished nor understood by electorates.

The last (native) speaker of my family was my great-grandpa, who died 24 years ago so basically two generations of my family had barely any exposure to Gr√¨ko. From what I have been told he wasn't extremely proficient in it, but that was in his last years when he hadn't spoken to anyone in it for almost 30 years, so he might have simply been ""rusty"" with it. I learnt it simply for my roots' sake but I actually had only 2 occasions in my whole life to test it by speaking with someone else, and sadly both times it felt like we both where being forced to speak it. From what I know old people speak it sometimes but young people rarely learn it, except maybe a few sentences and words. Honestly, if you ever wish to visit us and speak to Gr√¨ko with someone, you're better off asking the elders, they probably will be the only ones able to reply to you in Gr√¨ko. Tho don't get your hopes too much up, with the generation shift that's been happening lately here it feels like the old farts are dropping like crazy.

&gt;Or is it viewed as useless?

It undeniably is. Culture preservation is unfortunately not something that you do out of usefulness, but out of love for it. When that love is missing, you have nothing to resist assimilation. Honestly it's not even about the government anymore (ofc they aren't helping that much since throwing money at a problem until it stops being a problem rarely works, but hey at least they aren't making things worse like in the past (cough cough *Mr bold man*)), at this point it's more about people not wanting to be part of it. Seriously, the only thing you'll ever get back from Gr√¨ko is a thick accent, and that's already a problem for most southerners here.

All of this apocalyptic talk done, there are plenty of opportunities for learning Gr√¨ko, both irl and online, so if you really want to it's not like anyone's gonna stop you.

________________

Britain makes such a wonderful example, however, because its descent into Quaker-thug hell is so fresh, and proceeded from such a height. Witness, for example, this lovely story from the Times archive, which is barely 50 years old‚Äî‚Äúin the lives of those now living,‚Äù unless of course they have since been stabbed:

&gt;&gt;JUDGE ON RACE GANG WARFARE

&gt;&gt;7-YEAR SENTENCES

&gt;&gt;Two men were each sentenced at Central Criminal Court yesterday to seven years‚Äô imprisonment for their part in an attack on John Frederick Carter, fruit trader of Sydney Square, Glengall Road, Peckham, who received injuries to his face and head which required 60 stitches.

&gt;&gt;They were Raymond David Rosa, aged 31, bookmaker‚Äôs clerk, of Northborough Road, Norbury, S.W., and Richard Frett, aged 34, dealer, of Wickstead House, Falmouth Road, S.E. The jury had found them both guilty of wounding Carter with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm.

&gt;&gt;Passing sentence, Mr. Justice Donovan said: ‚ÄúI have not the least doubt that there are other and very wicked persons behind you, but the tools of those persons must realize that if discovery follows punishment will be condign.‚Äù

&gt;&gt;‚ÄúMORE LIKE CHICAGO‚Äù

&gt;&gt;Summing up yesterday, his Lordship said that the facts of this case sounded more like Chicago and the worst days of prohibition than London in 1956.

&gt;&gt;Putting two and two together, the jury might think this was another case of race gang warfare. If that were so, then it raised the question of whether the reluctance of Mr. and Mrs. Carter to swear that the two men they had previously picked out were concerned in the attack was due to fear. It was that possibility which put this case into quite a different category. It put it into a category where gross violence had been perpetrated upon a man but after identifying his assailants he and his wife had expressed doubts in the witness-box. The jury were not concerned with the merits or de-merits of Carter. The issue was much wider than Carter‚Äôs skin: it was simply one of the maintenance of law and order without which none could go about with safety.

Etc., etc. Notice that both of these miscreants are in possession of at least nominal occupations. Mr. Justice Donovan, honey, with all due respect, you don‚Äôt know nothin‚Äô ‚Äôbout no ‚Äúrace gang warfare.‚Äù

And finally, completing our tour of the British criminal justice system, we learn that:

&gt;Two South Africans who overstayed their British visas were jailed for life on Friday for the murders of two men strangled during a series of violent muggings.

&gt;Gabriel Bhengu, 27, and Jabu Mbowane, 26, will be deported after serving life sentences.

No, that‚Äôs not a misprint:

&gt; A life sentence normally lasts around 15 years.

Orwell could not be more satisfied. ‚ÄúA life sentence normally lasts around 15 years.‚Äù With not a hint of irony in the building.

**Something is normal here, and it is either 1956 or 2008.** It can‚Äôt be both. If Mr. Justice Donovan, or the Times reporter who considered a mere 60 stitches somehow newsworthy, were to reappear in modern London, their perspective on the art of government in a democratic society unchanged, they would be far to the right not only of Professor Aldridge, but also of the Tories, the BNP, and perhaps even Spearhead. They would not be normal people. But in 1956, their reactions were completely unremarkable.

What‚Äôs happened is that Britain, which before WWII was still in many respects an aristocracy, became Americanized and democratized after the war. As a democracy, it elected its own people, who now tolerate what their grandparents would have found unimaginable. Of course, many British voters, probably even most, still do believe that burglars should go to prison, etc., etc., but these views are on the way out, and the politics of love is on the way in. Politicians, who are uniformly devoid of character or personality, have the good sense to side with the future electorate rather than with the past electorate.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ecvyoy/teen_who_targeted_samesex_couple_in_brutal_london/fbe6nro/,lost_snake,1576779390

5744,"&gt; Sure, but 2050 isn't that hard to predict. 

It's harder than you might think. Take a gander at a few [predictions from 1990;](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/296611468740975029/pdf/World-population-projections-1989-90-edition-short-and-long-term-estimates.pdf) see how well they did. I mean, you could possibly explain Germany's projection for 2020 of 16.8m+54.6m = 71.5m (instead of the actual # of 82.8 million, or 16% higher) to be forgivable because who would have figured out the eventual effects of re-uniting Germany, but that's part of my point. There will be substantial changes in the world from now to 2050. 

Here's the projection from 1990 to 2020 versus the actual 2018 population size for a few European countries:

... Projected for 2020 ... Actual 2018 ... % actual &gt; projected

Germany ... 71467 ... 82790 ... 16%

5796,"It‚Äôs become fashionable of late in central Europe to accuse French President Emmanuel Macron of being a ‚Äúneo-Gaullist‚Äù who touts the cause of ‚ÄúEuropean sovereignty‚Äù as a cover for expanding French power, cozying up to Russia and keeping the U.S. at bay. Worse, he‚Äôs undiplomatic about it all, arrogant, ‚ÄúJupiterian.‚Äù

This interpretation may be understandable for the Poles and Balts. They feel most threatened by Russia and most dependent on the U.S. They distrust French dreams of Gallo-European grandeur. But for France‚Äôs most important partner, Germany, rejecting Macron‚Äôs ideas is downright hypocritical. If anybody is to blame for his iconoclasm, it‚Äôs the Germans who have left him hanging for two years now.

Since the 1950s, it has been generally accepted that a so-called Franco-German ‚Äútandem‚Äù is necessary to pull the rest of Europe forward. Whenever the two historical-enemies-turned-friends agreed on more European integration, it went ahead; whenever they didn‚Äôt, it fizzled out.

The relationship was based on an implicit deal. Germany was the economic leader but wouldn‚Äôt boast about it. France would pay lip service to the economic reforms the Germans demanded, while remaining continental Europe‚Äôs diplomatic, political and military leader ‚Äî with nuclear weapons, a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and post-colonial tentacles.

The deal was captured symbolically in 1962, when Chancellor Konrad Adenauer met Charles de Gaulle in Reims cathedral for a mass of reconciliation, and de Gaulle‚Äôs chair was slightly taller than Adenauer‚Äôs. Subsequent chancellors followed the pattern. Helmut Kohl ostentatiously bowed three times to the French tricolour before nodding once to Germany‚Äôs black, red and gold.

Behind the pageantry there were huge ups and downs. For every time a German chancellor and a French president held hands on some blood-drenched former battlefield, there were phases of mutual sulking. Gerhard Schroeder and Jacques Chirac spent half a year in the late 1990s barely talking. But it never mattered, because both sides realized that they were stuck with each other.

In the years following the euro crisis, Berlin‚Äôs fears about France‚Äôs economy grew. Germans were already wary of bailing out Mediterranean countries. They knew that if the French ran into trouble too, the game would be over. Playing into stereotypes about lecturing Teutonic know-it-alls, Chancellor Angela Merkel and her ministers harangued a succession of French presidents about ‚Äústructural reforms‚Äù and ‚Äúausterity‚Äù (saving, basically).

German fears verged on panic in the spring of 2017. The right-wing populist Marine Le Pen, using Germany as bogeyman in her oratory, seemed to have a shot at becoming French president, calling the entire European Union into question. Berlin‚Äôs cognoscenti were unanimous that if her opponent, Macron, prevailed, Germany would make big concessions to strengthen him.

Macron did prevail, and turned out to be, on paper, a Frenchman of German dreams. At last, here was a president who not only promised but undertook reform: first of France‚Äôs calcified labor market, now of its absurdly fragmented pension system. His style could‚Äôve been less brash. But he showed political courage, and has been paying the price in riots and strikes.

Macron‚Äôs vision is also European and geopolitical. Soon after taking office, he voiced big ideas for reforming the euro area, which remains vulnerable to another crisis. He wants joint deposit insurance for the region‚Äôs banks, a large collective budget to be used for counter-cyclical fiscal management, a euro-area finance minister to run this budget, and more.

Berlin listened politely, then ignored him. Germany couldn‚Äôt act, Merkel‚Äôs people explained, because they were campaigning; then because they were in coalition negotiations; then because they were in a coalition that isn‚Äôt stable.

Meanwhile, Merkel, as is her wont, kept slicing Macron‚Äôs big ideas into ever smaller pieces until they became unrecognizable. Just one example: The euro area may still get its own budget, but it‚Äôll be small enough to be drowned in the proverbial bath tub and will have enough strings attached to be useless for fiscal stimulus, its original purpose.

Geopolitically, Macron (like Merkel) is scared by U.S. President Donald Trump and a rising China. He fears that in a bipolar world the EU could lose its ‚Äúautonomy.‚Äù So he wants to fortify Europe‚Äôs own defenses ‚Äî obviously with a lot of French hardware ‚Äî and also pry Russia out of China‚Äôs embrace.

Not all of this is plausible or sagacious. But Macron‚Äôs bigger goal is simply to start the necessary conversations. That‚Äôs also why he blocked accession talks for Albania and North Macedonia. His message is that before the EU metes out veto powers to even more small countries, it must become deeper and stronger.

The Germans, meanwhile, keep hiding behind their platitudes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the ones always saying no,‚Äù admits Sigmar Gabriel, a former German foreign minister. This is a tragic denouement to fears during the euro crisis about German ‚Äúhegemony.‚Äù Instead of too much German leadership, Europe now has none.

The tandem, Macron has realized, has only one rider. Frustrated, he‚Äôs decided to keep peddling without Merkel. He won‚Äôt stop challenging and provoking her. And why should he? Somebody has to ask the big questions. Instead of whining about this, the Germans could give it a try.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ecsokc/emmanuel_macron_isnt_gaullist_hes_just_angry_at/fbdubg3/,Neversetinstone,1576771504

That is not how planting works. Like with Corn, farmers do not save and reuse their seeds from old corn crops. These are hybrid seeds which you have to buy new every year. If you reuse seeds the then the F2 generation will lose the hybrid vigor of the F1.


But you know what? There is a simple answer to your question. Monsanto and the plant companies originally just wanted to make the plants infertile by adding a terminator gene so they couldn‚Äôt cross pollinate other crops.

So these companies basically ""sell"" old ones to whoever is willing to take them. So they end up in 3rd world countries.

5939,"\&gt; Not completely empty, they don't hesitate to mention they have a permanent seat in the UN Security Council (entitles them to political Overlordship status, they think), and have nuclear weapons (get rid of NATO and replace with French supreme command). 

None of this is true.  France actually signed a treaty last year to support a German permanent UN seat, and has proposed sharing the nuclear arsenal command with Germany. France actually gains from NATO because unlike the smaller states like Poland, they can actually get someone into upper command, since the position is reserved for the larger states like Britain and Germany. But the French military community doesn't want to play second fiddle leading a paper tiger and support an EU command, not because they would automatically dominate it by weight of....anything, but because they genuinely think they are right. France is the only EU state with an active foreign policy, and they believe if the EU had one they would corelate. They genuinely believe French interest in North Africa and the middle east are European interest, and the only reason other states don't see it that way is because their foreign policy is ""stay out of everything"" or ""follow the americans"".  


\&gt; What is held against them, specially by Germany, is their financial mess. It's not smart to spend money you don't have and France is spending more (pensions at age 54\*) than they receive in taxes.

Everyone is spending more than they receive in taxes, except Germany, so hardly the accusation you think it is when of all things France is set to grow more than Germany in 2018. Especially when the major domestic point against Macron is that he is extremely harsh on pensioners. So quite a jumbled accusation to make, it's anachronistic.

\&gt; The combination of demanding more influence while not having their own house in order is considered 'silly' by several EU countries who do have their finances under control.

Are they demanding more influence? Because it seems you are just interpreting them demanding more EU influence as somehow meaning their own, not them actually saying anything of the sort.
