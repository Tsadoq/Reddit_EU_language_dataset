62,"&gt; Russia and Serbia didn’t win territory after a war (as every country does), 

That is not what every country does. West Germany did not lose its prewar territory, it was only East Germany which did so because the USSR wanted to both punish Germany by giving its territory to the Poles and to itself. France didn't annex Westphalia or anything, it was only the Soviets which did so. Likewise, the Americans didn't annex Hokkaido or take Okinawa away from Japan. I could go on, but this was solely restricted to outliers in the modern world, not the standard. 

&gt; Not that it matters since you failed to link any of your past comments anyway. Looks like you’re just another person doing the trendy thing, shitting on Israel disproportionately and irrationally.

You accused me. I don't need to provide evidence for your accusations; you need to. I'm not going to waste my time combing through my comments just to show you I don't just criticize Israel; that's ridiculous. Also, where is your proof that I am shitting on Israel disproportionately and irrationally? I criticize Israel on something they did and that I don't agree with, and your response is

a) A total non sequitur and whatboutism by bringing up other territorial expansions
and
b) accusing me of unfairly criticizing Israel because I hate them, as well as everyone who doesn't agree with the annexation of ""falling for Syrian propaganda""

You never defended Israel's decision to annex the Golan Heights, not at any point. In fact you compared Israel to the Soviets. It sounds like to me that you have an unconditional love for Israel and you can't rationally defend it even when you know they're wrong.

&gt; Again, when you start a war and lose, you lose territory. That’s how the world works. Syria and Egypt started a war, got their asses kicked, and lost territory. Israel offered it back to Syria and they refused. Cry me a river.

No it isn't. There have been countless wars since 1948, very few ended with actual annexations of territory like Israel did. When America invaded Iraq, they didn't partition the country between them and their allies. They didn't give territory to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Even in Cyprus where Turkey occupies the northern half of, they still haven't annexed the territory. 

You see, Israel didn't just occupy it, they also settled it and use these settlements to justify annexation. Who else has done this? The Soviets under Stalin in the post-WWII did this. Hitler did this as well, or at least planned to. The Serbian nationalists did this in Bosnia and Kosovo to also justify annexation. Is this who you're comparing Israel to?

Most people that go skiing never get killed during an avalanche, yet it's a great idea to be prepared and have a tracker. And people who install balcony railings?

That being said, I only wear a bike helmet when I'm going off track mountain biking, through the forest, with slippery tree roots everywhere and bunches of tricky conditions. Never while riding my normal bike through traffic, not even during rush hour. 

The trick is effort vs reduced risk. I'm not ready to carry my helmet with me during the day or everywhere I go.

-

&gt; In one unusual Canadian instance, Martha Black succeeded her husband George Black in the House of Commons of Canada when he had not died, but merely stepped down temporarily for health reasons; in the next election, Martha stood down and George returned to office. Another unusual circumstance occurred in the United States when Katherine G. Langley was elected to her still-living husband John W.

196,"&gt;So I’ve been told that ocean rise is imminent since I was a boy, literally the late 80s.

Tt's been happening, [and at an accelerating rate](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2680/new-study-finds-sea-level-rise-accelerating/), from about 2.5 mm/yr in the 1990s to about 3.4 mm/year now. The rate of rise has been on the [high side of the IPCC projections](https://static.skepticalscience.com/images/SLR_models_obs.gif).

&gt;Maybe so many people are skeptical because almost all of the time line predictions for climate change have been wrong.

[The early model predictions have really held up quite well](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming).

They are not expected or intended to capture all of the short-term variations, or tell the future about all of the inputs (such as how much emissions end up occurring, or random variations in solar activity). They are basically a tool to answer what-if questions. As George E.P. Box put it, ""All models are wrong, but some are useful.""

I often see people on reddit saying that they don't trust climate researchers' predictions, because ""They said that [X disaster] would have happened by [Year Y], and it didn't happen.""  I've noticed that the vast majority of these claims fall into two categories (or a combination):

1) That prediction was not made by scientists in a relevant field.

That looks sufficient to grab only the packets containing the plaintext domain at a packet level as a quick test on my system.  You've gotta:

* Wait for enough TCP header to get the port, which pretty much any matching is gonna need to do
* Compute a fixed offset from the TCP header and wait for a few more bytes to do the match to determine whether it's a handshake
* In theory, I guess you could need to defragment, but nobody is gonna intentionally fragment up their traffic into chunks small-enough to be problematic for this.
* Grab the string.

290,"&gt;The movement in the United States began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as John Muir and Henry David Thoreau making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book Walden, which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in Yosemite Valley and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form Yosemite National Park and went on to set up the Sierra Club in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature **were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism**.

Theres a million things you can come up with that is more effective than trying to tell people the 0.66% co2 emissions that is a result of airline aviation is what needs to be targeted.

I work in digital strategy for e-commerce. That means I'm partly involved in every part of the process, I see how things work basically. Trust me when companies pick how to source their goods what matters isnt the environmental impact unless that will somehow result in worse margins, and in almost every case it does not.

The only way to make us act responsibly is if we're legally forced to do so, that is the only way.

And until we're legally forced to act responsibly the options we will provide consumers will all ignore what impact they have on the environment so consumers dont have a fucking choice to begin with.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/c1lfnm/fridays_for_future/erff2rm/,rwwrou,1560806847

340,"&gt; Lol no it's not like that. Since the EU and the USA have repeatedly supported Cyprus in this matter, and Cyprus has arrest warrants for the crew of the drilling ship and is within its EEZ, all it would have to do is send ships (Greece and France can also lend a muscle there) to do exactly that. They don't have to fire first, and even if they did, they would be within their rights to do so because Turkey is the one violating. If they tried to board the ship and Turkey fired on them, that'd be on Turkey and it already lacks the support as it is.

The problem with that mentality is that Turkey has the naval strength to keep Cypris away from the drilling ships without firing. And if Cyprus fired first it would lose its support. 

&gt; Whose companies do you think will start drilling there? Cyprus's? Various other companies will progit from those reserves too. The USA and the EU still have ways to strongarm Turkey about its support in the Middle East. Turkey itself also wants to be part of whatever is going on there, without having the USA against it. Their biggest nightmare is a Kurdish state being formed right next to their border. Don't you worry, they want to be in the USA's good side with or without the Cyprus deal. If it was as simple as you're trying to make it seem, the USA would not be supporting Cyprus in this.

We get back to strategic a symmetry. The resources may be of extreme importance to Cyprus, such that ot could envision the US supporting a break away Kurdish state but it's really not that important to the US. Not to the extent that they would annoy their most powerful regional alley. 

&gt; Turkey is whatever its allies allow it to be mate. If the USA wants it as a regional power, it will keep it like that. If they see that i can move out of its control, they can bring it down. Turkey has been used like that for centuries. The Great Powers let it rise and sink according to their interests. Right now, Turkey is losing support left and right at least from its former allies. If they change their leadership and course, that might change but so far, it's not looking so good for them. Seems to me that Turkey is the one that has some accommodating to do, but hey you're clearly biased or with an agenda here so don't let me ruin your dream.

I agree with you that the US is still by far the biggest player in the region but European nations are facing a relative decline in power. Especially Western nations like France and the UK.

Are they saying that climate change is happening due to humans or is it natural?  Well, that's where the real discussion begins, and there are a lot of scientists that are divided on this issue.

Not only that, but a well known fact about this world is that ""science"" can be influenced with money.  Did you ever wonder how we got sold the whole ""Fat is bad, sugar is good"" bullshit?  Because MONEY buys ""scientists"".  Everyone has to eat, including scientists, and climate science has a lot of ""scientists"" willing to say anything that pays their meal.

So, as far as I know, the earth has gone through countless of ice ages and global warmings throughout history, without any human industrialization.

That is some serious education problem mate.

Poland
Latvia
Estonia
Hungary
Chechia
Romania

The moment Poland managed to switch without guns from soviets rest of soviet block followed with their own revolutions.
It took nearly 20 years of workers strikes in Poland to do that and many people died either from outright government show of force like people who were literally run over by police to covert means which made people disappear or die from ""random beatings""

&gt;""Lacked nothing"" is a bit of whitewashing now, isn't it? They had unemployment and homelessness for example, whereas the socialist states didn't. It's true they had more wares in the store, but duh, these countries were richer before the Eastern ones even became socialist.

Communism didn't solve homeless, drug abuse and any other problem. That is just lie. Most of that was hidden because it didn't jive well with official ""lie""

No mate they were not ""richer"". Chechia was virtually free of war for most of WW2 and they were still severely behind their neighbors. There is no nation on earth that can prove communism managed to do better work than capitalism. AND don't forget that all of them failed economically. So building for credit doesn't count when you in the end can't pay up. Poland is good example of that. Gierek ""reforms"" were all financed on debt and for 15 years Poland communism looked bright until time we had to pay up and then everything fell down.

Secondly i am talking about talons for food on products you can only get in one form in limited quantities.

Not ""less products"" but ""virtually no products"". I am talking about lack of literally toilet paper everyone had to steal from work because  you couldn't buy it from store. I am talking about waiting for ability to buy a car for about 2-3 years and car you got was fucking piece of junk for midgets.

It is clear that you have some idealistic view of communism/socialism which makes sense in theory but doesn't work in reality.

&gt;Most of the former communist parties consisted of the former managerial strata who wanted to live like their ""Western"" counterparts. Sure a higher-up bureaucrat in the USSR lived decently, but he didn't have four yachts in St. Tropez like a large capitalists.

Good to know that I'm irrelevant. So this is getting personal, I guess. FYI: We have somehow avoided assimilating to anyone for over 500 years, and aren't really planning on changing that. Shit, we're probably the only people in the Europe capable of *assimilating Russians* among us ;).

Here's a tip: In order to assimilate someone, you can't really look down upon them. You have to be willing to lift them up and treat them as family - which you did exceptionally well with our nobility (Mickiewicz, Kościuszko, Sapieha, etc) but have forgotten to extend it to the rest of the population.

568,"Yeah don't feel to superior, since I was replying from my phone.
So let's get cracking, don't we?
First of let's recognize judicial bodies we are trying to investigate here. As per Polish Constitution we have several main bodies, but to our discussion we really need only:

1. Supreme Court
2. Consitutional Tribunal

Before we jump into them, we need to talk about KRS, which is body that according to art.186.p.1 of Constitution ""National Judiciary Council safeguards judicial independence"" (translation mine). I would imagine that this body would irk someone, since it's not Parliamentary body or Presidential committee.  So who is part of that body?

1. First President of Supreme Court ( appointed by President of Polish Republic, chosen in fully democratic elections)
2. Minister of Justice ( voted in by Parliament, again fully democratic elections)
3. First President of Chief Administrative Court (appointed by President of Polish Republic, I won't repeat myself)
4. A person appointed by President
5. 15 members chosen between judges of Supreme Court, common courts, administrative courts and/or military courts
6. 4 members chosen by Sejm from Members of Sejm 
7. 2 members chosen by Senat from Members of Senat
(Art 187)

Ok - so we have 10 members either directly part of democratic body and/or appointed by President, but still we have another 15 right?  
But alas, even they had to be appointed by President at least once, at least according to Art 179 of Constitution, President of the Republic does all official appointments for judges.

Let's get back to Supreme Court and Constitutional Tribunal

As for Supreme Court oversight:
1. First President of Supreme Court  is appointed by President of Republic (Art 183.p.1)
2. Judges of the Supreme court are appointed by President, based on recommendation provided by KRS

As for Contitutional Tribunal:
1. Per art 194.p.1. - ""Constitutional Tribunal is made up of 15 judges, elected individually by Sejm for 9 years. They cannot be reelected."" (loose translation: mine)

they will keep buying chinese electronics and chinese clothing. in fact, they will be the first to call trump stupid for putting up tarrifs on china - yet if we didn't import everything from them it would help dramatically.

they aren't against stupid policies where it's worth producing milk or meat in one country, transporting it all the way to another country to process it, then to 3rd country where they package it. and then back to the first country to sell it.

instead of supporting more mass transit, we'll rather ban combustion cars and support electric ones. sure, most of our electricity is generated mostly from fossil fuels, but it's burned somewhere that isn't the car. of course, we're against nuclear though, so at least the electricity for those cars that really aren't egolocial to produce at all (subsidizing electric SUVs and full size cars to be green just fucking lol, way to stop funding corporations) would be clean.

etc etc. nobody is focusing on the problem as a whole, but the whole enviromentalist movement finds a scapegoat (currently co2 emmisions. methane is fine though so we are fine with natural gas that emits a lot of that but not as much co2). we'll make a huge, polluting production chain to build something that we can sell as ""green"". like a solar panel. or a car filled with batteries. or whole industries that buy carbon credits to ""offset"" their footprint. since we actually don't care about your pollution, just your money",,/r/europe/comments/c1lfnm/fridays_for_future/ereupvm/,verynicewebsite,1560793303

579,"Thanks for the reply! I understand that my comment must've been really seen as approximative.   
I got to agree on the fact that we have got very few notions of managing our money, because we are still under our parent's responsibility. 

&gt; We have seen what happens when governments try to implement green changes like increasing gas prices or instituting a car tax. 

If we take the example of France, this ""green change"" made by Macron was made to compensate the deletion of the ISF (Solidary tax on wealth), two decisions that would mostly bring more money to the richest and give less money to the lower class. Now obviously this is going to sound very socialistic, and although I don't follow the rich people = bad mindset, I would have preferred that these green changes and taxes on diesel would go to things that gives more to the people, like, as I said, education, health and environment. But again, you are right, it is a very nuanced subject.

&gt;You have no real slogans or solutions. You don’t understand the consequences of what you’re demanding. You don’t pay for yourself and you don’t self-manage so you can’t properly assess whether you’re ready for these changes or not. 

 I mean, YES, the kids can't do anything. But still, they're helping to raise awareness and are doing something for the planet, even though they have no control over ""adult things"" **yet**. I emphasize the 'yet' because they will have their say in the future. Actually, as a college student who took part in one of these marches, I met a lot of college students as well. I could seriously say we were the majority. But, hey, at the very least, we show we care about the environment, and that older adults should also care about it too.

Although, I gotta say it is absolutely the biggest flaw of the movement.

&gt;There are poorer people in your country and others that have no choice but to buy these unethical things.

What do you mean ""no choice""?

Let's talk about meat for example.  If everyone stopped eating meat, it would have a significant effect on emissions and the environment.  Not eating meat is something everyone can do, independent of government legislation, and if you don't eat meat then you're definitely not going to starve, so it's not essential.  Meat is usually more expensive, so unlike other ""green"" options it will probably be cheaper to switch to a meat free diet.  In spite of that, virtually no one is vegetarian.

So consumers could make the difference, but they don't.  Even those who claim to that we are on a ticking time bomb and the end is nigh.

611,"&gt; hese kids are alternating. It's not the same kids everytime and in the end their parents only allow them to go because they know they won't miss out.

I might, again, ask for any sources backing up that claim. But I guess at this point we´ve established your omniscience so you know what happens in hundreds of thousands of households all over the world. I mean it´s not like the figurehead of the movement, Greta Thunberg, recently announced that she´d been 1 year out of school now.

But even if we accept that claim - so what? It´s only a small personal sacrifice so it does not matter? Again, what a bogus point.

&gt;t might be college students and adult highschoolers and whatever and whatnot but the demonstrations still have no clear purpose other than to ""raise awareness for climate change"". If you tell a kid how biomass energy is a clear negative, they won't understand.

Like - whut? They have a clear demand - enforce the treaty of Paris, enforce the climate goals our own governments have set for us. Slow down global warming so it does not reach the irreversible point of 2°C Celsius. Abandon fossil fuels. For Germany for example, one of the clear demands is to accelerate the abandonment of Coal energy and drop out before the planned year of 2038.

&gt;If you tell a kid how biomass energy is a clear negative, they won't understand.

And, as established earlier, this movement is supported by college students and scientists. So again I ask you - what is your point?

&gt;Everyone above the age of 18 is entitled to voice their opinion in a way that matters but outside of this institution I fail to see how a consistent effort of demonstrating without clear objectives will improve anything

No, every citizen has the right to voice their opinion. That is one of our most quintessential rights and certainly not tied to age. And, again, there are very very clear demands. And, again, the demonstrations have already proven fruitful as every major party is now forced to deal with it due to the societal pressure created.

&gt; There is a balance, with center right and center left constantly making compromises as to guarantee the highest quality of life for the state citizens. This balance must be preserved using different methods than utilising hordes of ""children"".

If you still haven´t understood, this is not an issue of ""right vs left"". We are not in the US were there are two parties. And the whole issue of climate change transcends thos arbitrary political lines anyway. One of the reasons that our ""center right"" and ""center left"" parties in here in Germany have had tremendous losses is that they have completely neglected the issue. So you can hardly speak of a balance.

&gt;There, two perfectly moderate opinions following the word ""but"" using your examples.

Yeah, unlike your previous one. Not that anyone would actually use the phrases before uttering the rest of the sentence because they themselves prove it.

&gt;Okay so you think children are politically nuanced to a point where we should take into account their opinions? What should the age of voting be reduced to?

629,"&gt;It's not illegal occupation if generations of Albanians have been there for centuries in the first place.

Yes it is, because there is not a single law that allows them to secede, there are only laws that don't allow them. Serbian constitution, UN Resolution 1244, Helssinki accords, read them.

Simply existing on some land doesn't make it yours. I mean everyting outside your house is state property: streets, institutions, forests, mountains, rivers... their legal owner is Republic of Serbia and just living nearby doesn't give you the right to chose their new owner. That's how law works, it's not that hard to understand.

1. Many historians don't support your claims about having Illyrian ancestors.
2. There is no proof that Illyrians lived in Kosovo when Slavs arrived, there are only proofs that they lived in what's today Albania
3. The first ever census in Kosovo from the 14th century shows the overwhelming (99%) Serbian majority

&gt;It doesn't matter how much it will take for Kosovo to be known by all the countries

There are currently much more countries revoking the recognition than the ones recognizing you, so it seems that process isn't going too good for you. 

&gt;you will get nothing back and no one's gonna start a war for your claims

Do you realize that as soon as the USA abandons you, Kosovo will get back where it truly belongs? Serbian army wouldn't need more than a few days to accomplish that.

Turkey has more then 4x bigger population than romania and has more then 4x bigger economy. for greek case population is like 8x and again economy is more than 4x in PPP terms gap even bigger. and while Turkey having diverse economy and defense industry Greeks can not even afford a conflict with Turkey without making its already bankrupt economy worser since their biggest income is tourism that would destroy Greek economy.

so who's gonna ""kick"" Turks ? bulgarians ? serbians ? greeks ? or is it mighty romanians ? lol

785,"&gt; After 2000 years ?

Are you aware there's been a continuous Jewish presence there since Jews existed?  And nonstop conquering and ethnic cleansing by outsiders is the only reason Israel hasn't existed this whole time?  And that for those 2000 years Jews have prayed and desired to go back (it's been a fundamental prayer in Judaism to one day return) and there have been consistent attempts throughout history to go back en masse and resume life there?  

The area was not owned by anyone at the time due to WW1 (the British and French briefly owned it short term of course) so I don't actually see a better time to go back.  

Also all the world's Jews aren't going back.  Only about half are there which is ~8 million.  The biggest reasoning is to have a safe place where persecution for being a Jew is not a threat from the government.  The Irish and English have that.  When the Irish didn't they fought nonstop to get it which is ironic because many of them hate the Jews for doing the same thing.  The difference is the Irish weren't mostly expelled but if they were I'll bet they'd try to go back.",,/r/europe/comments/c1kojf/map_countries_that_recognize_palestine_are/erea00f/,AppropriateOkra,1560778449

(That doesn't mean that the propaganda wasn't believed or, indeed, true at times - often the best propaganda is true, and there's never really been any need to manufacture untruths to critique Israel.)

Personally I have no argument with the line that the Soviets pushed in the General Assembly - that Zionism is a form of racism. I'd probably phrase it slightly differently... Zionism is settler-colonialism and as such necessitates racism... but that's a quibble.

However, those in charge of Soviet foreign policy direction were as cynical and with as disjointed a relationship with truth as the most ardent Hasbarist.

Separately, it seems you have an argument with the existence of antisemitism in the Soviet Union. It existed - and it existed even for secular Jews - and, whatever its validity as a foreign policy, anti-Zionism provided a rhetorical cover for this.

The port in sevastopol is absolutely crucial and if crimea is under western control via ukraine the kerch strait is no longer controlled by russia and cant be relied on.

russia is already closed into the black sea by turkey, getting further pushed back is not an acceptable situation.

&gt;What bullshit is this? Crimea remained part of Ukraine because the internal borders of USSR became international borders of the newly independent countries. Even Russia agreed with that.

Crimea was given as a personal gift to ukraine by Khrushchev while USSR was still a thing (1954) and while it had basically no impact at the time it was destined to be a huge fucking mess when USSR fell and crimea suddenly belongs to ukraine, because thats clearly not where its ties were. It was greatly criticized even when it happened and Khrushchev did other bullshit things that would benefit Ukraine in a situation where USSR stopped being a thing.

Also at the fall of USSR Crimea declared its independence before ukraine did, it was an independent state and was self governing, Ukraine infringed on this right more and more as time went on until they ripped up their constitution in the 90s.

Let me quote a previous post:

---------

There is a long history of Crimea trying to secede from Ukraine. For example, [in 1994, Crimea tried to secede](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_referendum,_1994), but was strong armed by the [Ukrainian government into staying against their wishes.](http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-21/news/mn-60465_1_black-sea) The next year they [deposed the President of Crimea for talking about secession](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01y59y0), removed the Crimean government and tore up the Crimean constitution and forced the Kiev rule on them. 

Effectively, Crimeans voted overwhelmingly for independence from Kiev in 1994, Kiev annexed it in 1995 and then passed laws without any input from Crimea to ensure it remained as part of ""Ukraine"" from then onwards:

&gt;On 20 January 1991, Crimea regained its status as an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This was many months before Ukraine declared its own independence on 24th August 1991. In February 1992, it renamed itself as the ""Republic of Crimea"". On 5th May 1992, Crimea declared itself ""Independent"" pending the outcome of a referendum to be held in August 1992. On 15th May 1992, the Ukrainian parliament declared the declaration of independence to be illegal and gave Crimea one week to cancel the referendum. In June 1992, both sides reached a compromise and it was given the status of ""Autonomous Republic"". In May 1994, the then President of Crimea re-opened the Crimean referendum, and contrary to the wishes of Kiev who tried to stop it going ahead, voters voted in favor of the following 1: 78.4% voted in favour of Crimean Independence that had relations with Ukraine on the basis of a set of treaties. 2: 82.8% voted in favour of dual Russian/Ukrainian citizenship. 3: 77.9% voted in favor of Presidential Decrees not covered in the May 1991 constitution being made law. 

&gt;Following these results, in March 1995, Kiev's Parliament tore up Crimea's constitution and permanently removed the post of ""President of Crimea"" and from June to September it was governed under a Presidential Decree from the Ukrainian President. In October 1995, Crimea wrote a new constitution which wasn't recognised by Ukraine until 1996 following amendments which ruled that Crimea's constitution must be approved by Kiev. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Autonomous_Republic_of_Crimea
 
Funnily enough, the West didn't bellyache and moralize about Crimea's massive vote in 1994 or Kiev's annexation of it in 1995. 

And the result is that today, the people of Crimea show a [strong support towards Putin and a strong dislike towards Obama according to Washington Post polls](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/22/how-popular-are-putin-and-obama-in-crimea-and-eastern-ukraine/).

All of these facts add up to make Putin very popular in Russia and [very unpopular in America](http://i.imgur.com/8L20ihQ.png).

-------

&gt;So what about Chechens in Russia, for example? They wanted to secceede as well, even fought wars with Russia over that. Are you going to lecture Russia there about ""will of the people""? Or is it completely normal that Russia only gets to annex lands, never give up on them?

&gt; It's not a war, if Cyprus wants to go to war over it, good luck but I am not going to advocate sending Italians to fucking die over oil. That's your show. 

You could have said the same even if Turkey straight out invaded Cypriot sovereign lands. ""It's your issue, i'm not dying over it"". That's fair i guess if that's how you feel. I'm assuming you're priviledged enough to not have to deal with a country threatening *your* waters and interests so it's a pretty convenient stance to have, enjoying help from the EU while not risking your sovereignty and resources, but when it comes to another member being threatened you nope the fuck out of that. The question is how your government is going to act cause Unions like that are tested when the shit hits the fan.

&gt; I would be in favour of sanctions 

Every single post you have posted in here is actually against Cyprus in some form. Your very first comment about Cyprus asking for sanctions was ""The EU is dealing with too much atm, we can't deal with that"".

I mean.. it wasn't meant as an insult but i just can't help wondering what your agenda is here. 

&gt;  but stop comparing EEZ disputes to literal invasions, grow up and learn what they are.

1009,"Dane becomes Lord Mayor of Rostock

Claus Ruhe Madsen will lead the Hanseatic city of Rostock for the next seven years. The independent Dane is the first mayor of a German city without a German passport.

The non-party Dane Claus Ruhe Madsen has won the mayoral election of the Hanseatic city of Rostock. According to the preliminary final result, the 46-year-old won against Social Senator Steffen Bockhahn (left) on Sunday with 57.1 percent of the votes.

According to the German Association of Cities, Madsen is the first mayor of a large German city without a German passport. He was able to maintain his lead from the first ballot three weeks ago. Madsen, who was supported by the CDU and FDP, had won 34.6 percent of the vote against eight competitors, Bockhahn 18.9 percent.

In an initial reaction, Madsen said that the task now was to unite the Rostockers. ""We must move Rostock together,"" he told the German Press Agency. Madsen was President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Rostock for six years and was previously head of a regional furniture store chain with five locations and around 100 employees.

Madsen succeeds Lord Mayor Roland Methling (non-party). He led the Hanseatic city for 14 years with around 210,000 inhabitants and could not rejoin due to age reasons.

1287,"I got an incredible deleted reply to this:

&gt; Now imagine that Mexico breaks into pieces, all forming their own new little countries, and that the part bordering the United States calls itself ""The Republic of Texas"". France and Germany and Russia and Japan and other influential countries start calling that new country in northern Mexico ""Texas"". That new and ""microscopic"" country starts teaching their children that Stephen Austin, Dwight Eisenhower, Willie Nelson, and others, are from this ""Texas"", THE Texas, instead of the the US State that's called ""Texas"". Oh, and the language of that new country? ""Texan""! Which is totally not Spanish with a few different regional words, but just ""Texan"". Their flag? Just recolor The Lone Star and call it a day. And when they get called out for that, they change it so ""totally not the Lone Star but with a different shape now"". They just need to persuade enough people globally that they are on the right side, and that the Texans from the USA are ""butthurt, scared, and oppressive towards our self-determination"". People from Dallas and Houston flood their own city streets to protest, and the world says ""You're not Texans, you're Americans, the people from that new nation are Texans"".
Does all of this sound absurd? To the point where you will just call me a nut, downvote, and move on? It's all already happened with Macedonia. They didn't need to invade with a military. That's what happened with Alexander, that's what happened with ""Macedonian Language"", a dialect of Bulgarian baptized as a ""totally new language"" by a Yugoslav Dictator to stop Bulgaria from claiming their people back. That has all already happened, to the point where we had to capitulate and let them keep ""Macedonia"" in their name. That is what we're scared of. Losing our history and identity so that another nascent nation can have it because they invite more international pity over ""debt-ridden, lazy, stupid Greece that just wants to bully a smaller country for no good reason"".
Any way, all that stuff is now done and gone. North Macedonia agreed to the name, Greece agreed to the name. Both signed that it's over. Is it too much to ask a reputable international news organization to honor the deal instead of reinforcing the idea that the whole deal was a sham?

To which my response is, this just exemplifies the disconnect to me. Why is it any concern of ours that the next country over is LARPing as Texas? We don’t speak even speak their language to hear any of this, why would we disrupt our days, take to the streets and be “blockade that country” furious over them thinking that our history is cooler than their own in their domestic consumption. It’s not reasonable to ruin their economy over something that will never impact my life outside of a few people being mistaken on what Texas we’re talking about.

If you’re upset with the news organization, then that’s your prerogative. You can write them angry screeds of emails and probably get them to make an edit, but this wasn’t focused on Greek audiences and they’re the only people who really care about this issue. We all understand what the shorthand means from the context; if all writers had to write out full formal names like “The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” each time the country was mentioned it would just be bothersome when UK will do.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/c18ntz/macedonia_on_track_for_eu_accession_talks_but_not/erdn9ye/,sparkling_uranium,1560748293

1328,"&gt;However the holodomor specifically was caused by farm owners burning their crops and slaughtering their cattle when faced with collectivisation.

That is a reason of 20% of all losses. But not the main case, since many peasants were serednyaki (owned at least one cow/horse and decent amount of land, but workes solely on it) and destroyed their surplus extremely rarely. 

Main reason is climate. By 1932 there was a severe drought, that affected approximately all chernozem lands in Central Russia, Povolzhye, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, Caucasus, some of Poland and Romania. Reason of it is simple, plains of that regions have no mountains on North ans West, which makes the climate ustable, sometines extremely. That cyclically led to constant extremely severe hungers in [Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1601%E2%80%9303) . 


Second reason is peasantry. Peasant system is completely unable to bear any serious catastrophes, due to absolute lack of machinery, irrigation, special education and skills. *And what could you expect from country, which had approximately 78% of peasant population, which already brought entire USSR to a classical early-capitalist peasant land-crisis*?

That was actually well expected. The 20% drop rate was. Drought wasn't.  Lemme explain you one thing.

By 1917, Russia still was a *feudal* state. That meant that absolute majority of it's population were peasants. They also were the economical basis of the country. Their worst problem was ""landlessness"" - there were *so many of them* that each held a tiny amount of land that was mostly absolute shit, since good arable land was held by pomecshiky / feudals. Peasantry *demanded* chorny peredel / black redistribution, when all feudals go to the graves, land loses any property, except property by the peasant communes. The land is distibuted to all peasant in amounts *related to ""number of eaters""* (a family gets as many land as there are members in it). 

Initially, Bolsheviks didn't want to make this peredel. It was anti-Marxist, and would just cause a huge crisis later. But peasantry *demanded* it. 

So, Bolsheviks decided. They turned Russia into peasant state in order to make it capitalust first throughout NEP.

It resulted in *82% of peasant population in year 1929*. The first doombell. Second one was kulaks (who decided that they will not sell surplus by the gov-t prices anymore and that they are able to seize power from the Soviets once and for all). Third one was 1930 small hunger. It resulted in ""now or never policy"", because, it was seen as ""we will sertainly get lower production now, but, if we don't implement machinery, and our plan of [climate defence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plan_for_the_Transformation_of_Nature), things would never go better.

Oh, and the language of that new country? ""Texan""! Which is totally not Spanish with a few different regional words, but just ""Texan"". Their flag? Just recolor The Lone Star and call it a day. And when they get called out for that, they change it so ""totally not the Lone Star but with a different shape now"". They just need to persuade enough people globally that they are on the right side, and that the Texans from the USA are ""butthurt, scared, and oppressive towards our self-determination"". People from Dallas and Houston flood their own city streets to protest, and the world says ""You're not Texans, you're Americans, the people from that new nation are Texans"".

Does all of this sound absurd? To the point where you will just call me a nut, downvote, and move on? It's all already happened with Macedonia. They didn't need to invade with a military. That's what happened with Alexander, that's what happened with ""Macedonian Language"", a dialect of Bulgarian baptized as a ""totally new language"" by a Yugoslav Dictator to stop Bulgaria from claiming their people back. That has all already happened, to the point where we had to capitulate and let them keep ""Macedonia"" in their name. That is what we're scared of. Losing our history and identity so that another nascent nation can have it because they invite more international pity over ""debt-ridden, lazy, stupid Greece that just wants to bully a smaller country for no good reason"".

Yes they do, some countries have far lower tax revenue than they should because people don't believe in paying them, so avoid paying them. Greece is a well known example of this.

&gt; If you fail to pay the amount required, the tax authorities prosecute you.

1409,"*doubtfully*

Turkey's fully secular?  I mean, they've got a religious authority that works on Islamic interpretation…

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Religious_Affairs

&gt; As specified by law, the duties of the Diyanet are “to execute the works concerning the beliefs, worship, and ethics of Islam, enlighten the public about their religion, and administer the sacred worshiping places”.[2] The Diyanet drafts a weekly sermon delivered at the nation's 85,000 mosques and more than 2,000 mosques abroad that function under the directorate. It provides Quranic education for children and trains and employs all of Turkey's imams, who are technically considered civil servants.[3] It has been criticized for ignoring the Islamic creed of the 33–40% of Turkey's population that is not Hanafi Sunni Muslim.[4]
&gt;
&gt;Started from 2006 the Diyanet was ""beefed up"", and by 2015 its budget had increased fourfold,[5][6] and staff doubled to nearly 150,000.[5] In 2012 it opened a television station,[4] now broadcasting 24 hours a day.[5] It has expanded Quranic education to early ages and boarding schools – ""enabling the full immersion of young children in a religious lifestyle""[4] – and now issues fatawa on demand.
&gt;
&gt;According to some observers (David Lepeska, Svante Cornell), since the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002, the mission of the Diyanet has changed – from one of exercising state oversight over religious affairs and ensuring that religion did not challenge the Turkish republic's ""ostensibly secular identity"", to that of promoting mainstream Hanafi Sunni Islam, ""a conservative lifestyle at home, and projecting ""Turkish Islam abroad"".[5]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/c1fntm/separation_of_religion_and_state_in_europe_and/erd2hom/,vokegaf,1560728936

Lets put in into perspective: 59 murders so far, let's say that adds up to 120 murders in a year in London, sounds alot, but London has a population of 8.8 million, so if we break it down the City would have a murder rate of 1,4 per Capita (per 100.000 Population). That rate is not bad at all and London had about 135 murders or so in 2018, seems like they will have less in 2019.

St. Louis in the US had a murder rate of 64,9 per Capita in 2017, that's 48 times higher than Londons likely rate in this year and according to my quick search in the Wikipedia there more than 100 Cities in the US that have a higher murder rate than London, not really that surprising, the murder rate in the US is already at about 5,5. Btw nothing against americans, just used the cities there as example because it's quicker to find the numbers from them.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone born and living in Berlin, my City in 2002 had a murder rate of 5,7 per capita, in some parts of Berlin you had to be very careful but the rest was ok, in 2018 the murder rate was about 2,4 murders per capita, it feels quite safe as a citizen, much of it probably also gang related like in London.",,/r/europe/comments/c1f63e/59_murders_already_this_year_whats_your_opinion/erd51yi/,-WYRE-,1560731116

1506,"Translation + a few contextual links for the uninitiated: 

&gt;*People are more interested in prices and wages rather than foreign policy, say experts*

&gt;An increasing number of Russians view Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan as our country's closest friends, according to data provided to [Vedomosti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedomosti) by [Levada-Center](http://www.levada.ru/en/). The proportion of respondents who include Belarus in this category has risen from 49% to 62% (a record-high value since polling began), the value for Kazakhstan has risen from 32% to 38%, Armenia from 11% to 22%, and Azerbaijan from 8% to 16%. China continues to hold second place among allies (42% compared to 40% in 2018). At the same time, both Syria and India are viewed in this regard by only 14% of respondents for each, compared to last year's 21% and 19% respectively. 

&gt;The top three countries most hostile toward Russia remain unchanged since last year: the United States, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. However, the proportion of respondents who view the US and Ukraine as hostile has sharply decreased: from 78% to 67% and from 49% to 40% respectively.

&gt;Whenever there is a feeling of isolation and of being an empire without friends, only the regime of Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko is viewed as an ally; the greater the perceived external pressure, the higher his symbolic status, explains Levada-Center director Lev Gudkov: ""The attitude toward [CIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States) countries owes itself primarily to the fact that an absence of hostility - including within mass media outlets - is automatically viewed as friendliness. Talks with [Prime Minister] Nikol Pashinyan also create the illusion of Armenia being an ally"". The absence of active military operations in Ukraine* and increased hopes for a warming of relations with new president Vladimir Zelensky have resulted in negative feelings to subside, says Gudkov: ""There is also faith in an improvement of relations with [US president] Donald Trump, not least because people are tired of the feeling of constant mobilization and threat of war; they want normalization and hope for a de-escalation of current tensions"". Hostility toward the United States also sharply declined because of the pension reform last summer, adds Gudkov: ""Russians apply the following logic to the government: you are picking our pockets, you don't have enough money for the war in Syria, for re-arming the army, you are solving your geopolitical problems with our tax money - which causes resentment"".

&gt;Negative feelings toward the USA and Ukraine have decreased because people are less interested in geopolitics; they are more concerned about prices and wages than world events, according to political scientist Aleksei Makarkin: ""Increased interest in domestic policy has resulted in softer attitudes toward 'traditional enemies'. They are still disliked, but a part of the population has gotten tired of this topic. Zelensky's election has also created a certain hope for normalized relations with Ukraine"". Improved relations with CIS countries can be explained by the fact that, when people become disinterested in geopolitics, they want to be friends with a familiar, tested circle of countries, adds the expert: ""A few percent of Russians know about campaigns against Lukashenko or that Pashinyan came to power in the wake of a revolution. Others primarily notice that these countries don't want to join NATO and don't criticize Russia on TV, but the average person doesn't care about nuance. Therefore there is less interest in looking for enemies and more interest in taking care of internal affairs while surrounded by allies"".",Russian in USA,/r/europe/comments/c1fagr/russians_animosity_toward_ukraine_and_the_usa_has/ercsut4/,svaroz1c,1560721041

1541,"&gt; If there's no will for enlargement, no encouragement i mean, and uncertainty towards EU's stance of Kosovo, then we will be sqeamish as well.   


I wasn't old enough to pay attention back then but what kind of encouragement did the EU offer to past members when they were negotiating? Plus from  what I've heard from Serbs on this subreddit most want the EU to criticise their Vucic ran country more, not give additional words of encouragement.   


&gt;Those things are happening, check the EU screenings of various chapters, almost all are improving, specifically the environment chapter was totally fucked , now it's improved.   

Right, my point is the government and society should be motivated to do these reforms even if joining the EU weren't  on the table.


&gt;That's just the German FM, not the EU Comission or something like that.    

The German FM speaks for the German government which has veto power on any new members. Also Germany is the EU's most powerful country and it has taken a special interest in the Bakans's through the Berlin process I think it was called. These statements matter.  

&gt;but the EU is all about 'normalization' which can mean anything really.     

What do you think it could mean? Do you realistically think it includes a scenario where Serbia violently getting Kosovo is considered ""normalisation""?   

&gt;Well by the looks of it another war is inevitable     

Why are you guys like this? Why can't we all just live in peace? You're not the first country to lose territory you know. Bulgaria's loss of Macedonia is much more dramatic than yours of Kosovo (because it's bigger, richer and a 100 times more culturally close  to us than Kosovo is to you) and we don't scheme about getting it back or base our entire foreign policy around it. Romania's lost Moldova, Greece Cyprus and so on. You know it's not even productive from a nationalistic point of view to try to get it back. These days a country's power is based on demography and economy, not territory. Keeping up tensions with Kosovo and especially  hypothetically attacking it is going to cost Serbia more than Kosovo is worth.    


&gt;The only possible outcome of having Serbia in the EU on friendly and eurofriendly terms is if the EU switches to being pro-Serbia instead of pro Kosovo.     

The EU is never going to betray it's values to the point it's ok with a Serbian war and annexation of Kosovo. That kind of crisis would make the Syrian civil war look tame.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/c18ntz/macedonia_on_track_for_eu_accession_talks_but_not/erctkj3/,ZmeiOtPirin,1560721596

A little interesting fact about Szczecin.

""Szczecin's city plan resembles that of Paris, mostly because Szczecin was rebuilt in the 1880s according to a design by Georges-Eugène Haussmann, who had redesigned Parus under Napoleon III . 
This pattern of street design is still used in Szczecin, as many recently built (or modified) city areas include roundabouts and avenues.""

1552,"&gt;That doesn't matter much in the post-89 Environment.

Sure sure.

Actually it does matter. Prztty much all Polish exports to the West either go through A2 and A4 highways, or through well-connected and centrally located ports in Gdańsk and Gdynia. Szczecin is like 300 km away from either of those trade routes.

&gt;And there is a lot of industry in Denmark, Northern Germany around Hamburg etc.

That industy does not send its exports through Szczecin either. Why would it be?

&gt;You're not going to convince me that being closer to Katowice or Krakow is more important than Copenhagen or Hamburg

The whole house of cards here is reliant on fetuses and new borns having equal moral standing and rights. Which is bullshit. A false equivalency to pump out garbage science and I really thought I could trust you to see that. 

For those in the back, let’s clear things up. 

A fetus is a parasite that requires a host to stay alive. Remove it from the host, the fetus dies. A baby, though it does need care to stay alive, does not need direct access to your organs. It needs external resources like all living things, but is otherwise fully capable of eating, pooping, making blood, and all the rest of it. 

A woman’s right to abortion is predicated on our inalienable right to decide what to do with our bodies and organs.

1736,"&gt; Lot of Chechens joined Nazi army during their advancement on Caucasus in WW2. 

That is not accurate. Chechen rebellion started already in 1940, when the Soviets and Nazis were still allies. It is said they were inspired by the Soviet Army getting their asses kicked in the Winter War.


[At least what is written in Wikipedia dismisses the claims of Chechen and Nazi alliance.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940%E2%80%9344_insurgency_in_Chechnya#German_support)

&gt;That the Chechens actually were allied to the Germans is highly questionable and usually dismissed as false.[10][11][12] They did have contact with the Germans. However, there were profound ideological differences between the Chechens and the Nazis (self-determination versus imperialism), neither trusted the other, and the German courting of the Cossacks angered the Chechens (their traditional enemies with which they still had numerous land disputes and other conflicts). Mairbek Sheripov reportedly gave the Ostministerium a sharp warning that ""if the liberation of the Caucasus meant only the exchange of one colonizer for another, the Caucasians would consider this [a theoretical fight pitting Chechens and other Caucasians against Germans] only a new stage in the national liberation war.""",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/c18w2q/city_of_grozny_chechnya/ercaut8/,Poultry22,1560707282

1738,"&gt;I once met a woman who had moved from Hungary to the UK, and she was complaining about having to pay tax, she said tax was just stealing from her pocket. She didn't seem to understand that the reason the UK was better than Hungary was because people believe in paying for the community.

Oh my god this is so bullshit.

Taxes don't require ""belief"". Taxes are imposed and enforced. No one likes to pay tax. No one pays more than they are required.

It's not like people in the UK are donating money to the government. They pay taxes, to the extent they are required. Just like any other country. If you fail to pay the amount required, the tax authorities prosecute you.

There's no goodwill or charity. Such fucking bullshit.

&gt;She was also incredibly racist and didn't see the irony in her emigrating to the UK and being opposed to people emigrating to Hungary.

I'm not for or against Hungary's actions with regards to immigrants. I'm a libertarian, I think people should be allowed to live wherever they choose.

But if you don't see the difference between normal immigration across countries, and a refugee crisis with a mass influx of immigrants, you're just being obtuse. It's not the same thing.

I have never really understood this mindset of ""let's just go full blitzkrieg on environmentalism and it'll work out!"" that a lot of you guys have. To put it simply, the moment we start grounding planes, laying off pilots, getting rid of many airports (because if we kill the aviation industry for the most part, we won't need a lot of the infrastructure), you will see economic consequences and protests of levels that will drown the student protests in comparison. And that's just aviation.

I'm all for more environmentally friendly policies. But I'll put my well being and the well being of my loved ones not just in the distant future, but now as well, in front of ""saving the world"".

But as you said, the whole issue is less of a technological barrier as it is with (purely) electric air travel, but more an economic issue. That will affect all possible energy sources.

Combining the hybrid electric drive proposed by airbus with biofuels would make for a more efficient and less noisy plane while at the same time reducing its carbon footprint.",,/r/europe/comments/c17xj6/airbus_considers_making_the_next_version_of_its/erbzofz/,stalagtits,1560698784

1769,"Well, before criticizing, we have to provide solutions, otherwise criticism does not make sense.

Fundamentally there are 2 holistic approaches to this. We have to decide which one do we want to live in:

1 Open borders (in accordance with a Laissez-faire system)

2 Controlled borders ( welfare state system )

&amp;#x200B;

1 If open borders is the choice, beware: If everyone is allowed to enter (situations of delinquents and sick people excluded) as in a pure Laissez-faire system, obviously there can be no Welfare State (it is obvious that such a system is not sustainable: number of contributors minimal and people on benefits sustained by system growing indefinitebly). Let's say that as for the system to work with a minimum of stability allowing people with low incomes to subsist, I only can see a negative tax income system with a generous tax-free base and a flax tax simplifying the complexity of the issue.

2 If we want to preserve the European Welfare System, for which so much has been fought, it is evident that a policy of open borders is by what has been said behind unsustainable, and would have to accept an open system by the top, so to say allowing easy immigration for prepared &amp; / or rich people, to match the globalisation trend, and at the bottom a strict system of quotas so as not to disadvantage the lower classes with unfair competition, who are the most disadvantaged by globalisation and who, on the other hand, are the majority of society (and who are the natural custormers of the local socialist parties that seem to have forgotten). 

As for Africa, in countries with corrupt elites that do not allow the state of their childhood to pass, it would be to recover the sense of ""protectorate"", which is none other than the guardianship that an elder exercises over a child.

Really? The Dacians were definitely not Latins, or Greeks for that matter. They had very little to do with Rome whatsoever, being simply another group of barbarian tribes. Any similarity would've developed after Roman conquest.

In this sense Romanians would surely be more Roman than Dacians prior Roman conquest, but we probably wouldn't forget the impactful migration of Balkan romance speakers to the region during the middle ages, as well as Slavic migration and subjugation by the Bolghars/Bulgarians and later Turkic nomads.

Obviously there's no ""Roman gene"" or the like, but if genetics are what we care about then it would've been the most Roman some point after the Roman conquest, but much before today. Culturally Romania is about as Roman as most anywhere else in Europe, so it's meaningless to argue that point about modern Romania at all imo.

1841,"&gt; The Dacians were definitely not Latins, or Greeks for that matter.

They were all part of the Indo-European family man, brother wars as I said.

&gt; group of barbarian tribes

They had a quite advanced society though, good metallurgists and traders. They had their own walled cities (even specific construction techniques developed locally), trade roads and overall centralized power (talking about the late stages of the kingdom, under Duras and then later Decebalus).

They were definitely more chiseled than the Germanic tribes further to the West or the Schytians to the North-East.

&gt; Romanians would surely be more Roman than Dacians prior Roman conquest

Prior to the actual Roman conquest in 106 AD, they had already been under the influence of Rome for almost a hundred years (since the rule of Burebista and his involvement in the Roman Civil war), archaeological findings proved that the Dacians have adapted quite some Roman technology (and elements of Latin culture) from then on. But in the sense of complete assimilation until the conquest, there was never such a statement made...

&gt; but we probably wouldn't forget the impactful migration of Balkan romance speakers to the region during the middle ages, as well as Slavic migration and subjugation by the Bolghars/Bulgarians and later Turkic nomads.

True, but strictly speaking of late 3rd and 4th century Romania (well this geographical space), the culture was a mixture of Latin and some minor Dacian elements. That was my point.

&gt; but if genetics are what we care about then it would've been the most Roman some point after the Roman conquest

Yes, you are right.

Today the genetic clustering shows a interesting situation though: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005472

&gt; Culturally Romania is about as Roman as most anywhere else in Europe

Well, tell that to Titu Maiorescu who pushed to re-Romanize the Romanain language and nation in the 19th century. We got rid of a lot of Slavic influences in our language since then. But then again, this is not really relevant to the subject, is it?

&gt; it's meaningless to argue that point about modern Romania at all

Now for historical and geographical reasons, the Hungarian language has borrowed some Slavic words and the word for German happens to be one of them. The word for country in Hungarian is _ország_. So _német_ (the Hungarianised word for mutes in Slavic languages) + _ország_ eguals to Németország, the land of the mutes.

A train from Berlin to Barcelona at 300km/h would still take ~7 hours without any stops. Given that you need stops to make that economically viable, I guess we get closer to 8-9 hours.

Go back to the pre-Renaissance era and it was all the rich gentry having kids and the poorer folk dying to plague, dysentery, typhoid etc. It was probably a gigantic contributor to why that era was so scientifically and culturally successful - it's fucked up but we had a natural culling owing to development of cities etc.

There is a different between war per se and imperialism. The Kosovo conflict was the final stepping stone in the ongoing onslaught of Yugoslavia in the context of NATO expansion eastwards. Read Michael Parenti's *To Kill A Nation*.

&gt;Individual party members who are centrists or individual policy decisions don't even make the Greens a centrist party overall much less ""right-wing"". Overall they very much on the left.

Their line is clearly right of traditional social democracy, which makes them centrist.

As far as I can see, Europe is faced with a serious problem. The report seems to me to suggest that there are three directions of solutions we could pursue, in order to ameliorate the situation, without having any hopes of reversing the trends:

(1) Higher Labour force participation, making Europe's numbers on the subject become similar to those of Sweden; that would help social security systems and make pensions, as well as other state functions, more sustainable

(2) Higher birth rates; pretty self explanatory

(3) Higher migration rates; also pretty self explanatory

In my view it would certainly be a good idea to focus on the first, through implementation of more ""flexicurity"" like schemes and systems across EU states. Then, it would be good to have the second, but I don't know how exactly that can be encouraged; do. countries like Poland with their schemes in place for subsidies for children work out? How about other countries? The only countries that spring to mind in Europe with increasing populations are France and Sweden, and both of these could very well be from migration. Which brings me to the final point; more migration can mean a lot of things. I think it would be a good idea to make migration easier and more accessible within the EU, but not for everyone. We should attract as many university educated migrants as possible, as many high skilled migrants as possible. To that effect, maybe some sort of massive European-Anglosphere-USA-Japan-S.

After Russian Empire fell, there was a civil war in Russia that resulted in bolshevik communists taking power. Meanwhile there was short-lived Ukraine Republic, that was invaded by Russian communists.

After taking over Ukraine, communists committed rural population to serfdom, expropriated all property, land, means of production and harvested grain to feed Moscow and export grain for cash to feed industrialization.

So many people who were comfortable with Merkel, the neoliberal SPD or the FDP have no problem switching to the Greens because climate change is the topic of the hour (just like refugees were the topic of the hour a few years back), and they still get a right-wing government. The Greens are pro-NATO neoliberals who, in their last coalition, have bombed Serbia and introduced crushing austerity (Agenda 2010 which treats the unemployed so inhumane that the constitutional court has declared the unemployment support to be unconstitutional), the only difference is that they put this green mask on and are pro-LGBT rights - although some factions within the Greens are even here very conservative, especially in the southwest of Germany where you have Mercedes-driving Greens like Kretschmar which are CDU-but-in-name or refugee-hating populists like Boris Palmer.

In terms of their environmental stance, there are also dubious positions, like being against nuclear energy, and even preferring to get out of nuclear energy before getting out of nuclear power.

In a year or so the Green tide will ebb down again and the pendulum will swing into the other direction again, especially if the Greens get it power and can be Merkel 2.0.

2158,"&gt; Still don't get how people fall for that bs.

Because all the (even the left ones) opposition parties cleared them. Strache and Gudenus vanished behind the curtains, and shitting on Kurz was more important to the opposition, especially the SPÖ (socialist party) than razing the FPÖ to the ground, as the ÖVP stood to end up winning votes from the desaster (as disillusioned FPÖ voters would be more likely to migrate to the ÖVP than anyone else). So the least they wanted to to is stick shit on Kurz and take down his government, to deny as much advantage as they could before the snap election they are all terribly unprepared for (especially the SPÖ with rendi wagner is in a horrid spot and tumbles form one internal crisis to the other). So here was the problem. The opposition together of course doesnt have enough votes to take down the government. Unless the FPÖ votes with them. 

They virtually allowed the FPÖ to descend under the radar. They almost vanished even in the eyes of the media as guilty party. Reading up, or listening to the politcians, youd have gotten the impression the entirety of the guilty parties were Strache, Gudenus, and ... Kurz. Kurz getting named more as the guilty one than anyone else, once Strache and Gudenus vanished. I havent mentioned Kickl yet, who certainly knew about it. He certainly was tarnished enough (at the very least nobody trusted him to lead an impartial investigation) that Kurz forced him to step down as minister for the interior. And that disgusting bragain bin Göbbles wasnt just smuggled back into the parliament by his parties, no, he also voted side by side with the opposition against.

So why wouldnt the FPÖ voters keep voting FPÖ? Even the opposition, that spent the last one and a half year gnashing their teeth and declaring the FPÖ should never, ever be in a government not only never accused the FPÖ as a party with a single word, no, they even voted with them and clearly stated that the last guilty party still around was Kurz.

 ""I would like to say loud and clear that our choices were not made against one country or another, but in the name of a certain idea of collective responsibility and of a world vision. We should not underestimate the stakes here. We need to know by which rules we would like to live together. Only consensus and respect for law can give force the legitimacy it needs. If we overstep this mark, could the use of force become a destabilising element. We also need to know how to manage the many crises throughout the world. Iraq is not an isolated case. North Korea and other countries are raising new threats of proliferation. We must therefore give ourselves the means to deal with them. We have started defining a disarmament method together and this method was giving results."" 

""The international community is most effective when it is united. The international community is truly legitimate when it assumes its full responsibility. Responsibility meant that the Council had to work relentlessly to improve inspections in order to make the most of Resolution 1441.

On top of that they had complains that almost 1 kilometer long brick and concrete riverside has no points where you can get into water or even sit. So they made some benches and stairs to grassy areas around the river. People started complaining that there are no toilets. They built a toilet but it costed 1 million PLN and half of it was some info office with a nice spot for a town hall ""friends"" that were close to president. This town has literally 0 tourists. Oh and I forgot! While they were making this riverside concrete bullshit, they pushed the sand and ground to the river making it very shallow. And one time there was some guy from Netherlands having a barge trip on European rivers, he got stuck on the side of the river next to that good damn riverside thing and nobody knew how to push him forward for 1km to realise his ship, so they just docked it to the side and that poor guy was living in my hometown for something like 6 months waiting while government gets founds to make the river ready for ships again.

2219,"Homosexuality wasn’t illegal in Croatia during its fascist era. It wasn’t illegal during many times when Croatia had autonomy in the context of Austro-Hungarian Empire or Yugoslavia either.

&gt;There is no record of how homosexuality was regarded in the Kingdom of Croatia that existed between the years 925 and 1102, after which Croatia entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary. The Penal Code established on 27 May 1852 in the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia (the first modern one in Croatian language) did not specify homosexuality as a crime.[6] A subsequent draft of the new Penal Code for 1879 for the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia suggested male homosexual acts be punished with up to five years of prison, but the draft was never formally adopted.[7]


&gt;Partisan court martial verdict from 1944: Partisan captain Josip Mardešić found guilty and sentenced to death because of his homosexuality
&gt;During World War II, there is no record of organized persecution of homosexuals in the Independent State of Croatia, whose laws did not contain a regulation directed against them.[8] The communist Yugoslav Partisans, however, issued several death sentences during the war against partisans whose homosexuality was revealed.[9]

&gt;During the period when Croatia was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, male homosexual acts were made illegal and punishable with up to two years of prison under the Penal Code of 9 March 1951.[10] However, the repression of homosexuals in Yugoslavia effectively began immediately after the end of the war. Homosexuals, labeled by communists as ""enemies of the system"", were also prohibited from joining the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.[11]

&gt;This situation changed when Croatia and other republics gained more control over their own legislature. Constitutional reforms in Yugoslavia in 1974 resulted in the abolishment of the federal Penal Code, allowing every republic to create its own. The Socialist Republic of Croatia created its own Code in 1977, and decriminalized homosexual activity. The Croatian Medical Chamber removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 – four years before the introduction of the new Penal Code, and seventeen years before the World Health Organization did the same.[8] Even though being a member of Yugoslavia meant Croatia was a socialist country, it was never under the Iron Curtain, thus making it a relatively open country that was influenced by social changes in the wider developed world.[12]",,/r/europe/comments/c17jbz/the_legalization_of_homosexuality_in_europe_every/erbccer/,drugo_lice,1560671953

Difference is small. In case of France, it  can be just language problem, that the questions were better translated  (or not ""better"", but even ""in a slightly hinting way"") to Hungarian than to French. Or even, maybe, by accident, precisely this set of questions is actually simply just a very little bit better expressible in Hungarian. But that does not help when looking at the bigger difference between German speaking countries. Actually the difference between Germany and Austria is more striking to me than the difference between Hungary and Austria.

Or it may be so that many Hungarians learned some real-life hard lessons during the wild times transforming their economy from planned one to market based one, while most French people lived in less wild and more conservative environment, naturally avoiding risky investments by common subconscious mass awareness but never individually learning hard lessons and never hard thinking about it, so some of them fail a bit when conveying that common subconscious mass awareness into answers in formal test.

2384,"&gt; “Thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God”. To phrase it another way: It is not wise to tempt the universe into deciding your fate.

It's an archaic way of writing ""don't try and force God to prove himself to you"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_4:7

&gt;In the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Jesus said unto him, It is written again,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
&gt;
&gt;The World English Bible translates the passage as:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Jesus said to him, ""Again, it is written,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’""

Sure, the particular scenario is that Jesus would be putting himself in a situation where if God isn't real, Jesus would happen to die.  But the objection isn't to his death, but to the fact that he's trying to force God to reveal himself.

On the *other* hand:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_6:28

&gt;In the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; And why take ye thought for raiment?
&gt;&gt;

Wait, what?

How can that work legally?

I'm not aware of any mechanism via which one country can commute another country's sentences (and I cannot imagine such a thing existing outside of colonial-type situations), nor where one country would punish another based on the judicial system in another country.

Remarkably, it is split into two floors. The first floor is devoted to the living area with room for coal and an open fire, and a water tap tucked behind the stairs. The upstairs holds the cramped bedroom, which also comes with a small niche for storage. How luxurious.

2464,"&gt;Why do you want the term ""concentration camp"" to only be relevant to the Holocaust? Do all other examples of them not count in your eyes?

I think the idea of the term was to reiterate that, when someone says ""it's a concentration camp"" don't assume that it's not ""concentrating people to send them off to a death camp."" 

It's not meant to say that ""all concentrations of people = wrong."" It says that you should be CAREFUL not to board a train, because some soldiers told you, that you are being sent to a concentration camp, only temporarily.

It does not mean that the EXISTENCE of concentration of people into a camp = genocide. It was in fact, standard military strategy to move populations around if there was a significant insurgency. It was a counter-insurgency strategy. Of course, people in modern times do not do this because of the OBVIOUS implications that it could be LIKENED to Nazi Germany. This is why modern military strategy does not do this. Also ethnic cleansing is against international law.

Putin was 100%, DEFINITELY NOT better than Stalin. He is the same as Stalin. Even worse because he is less honest and more deceitful. He may not murder the same amount as Stalin, but give it time.

&gt;centuries, so what's not to like?

He really isn't. He's no different than any other dictator.

&gt; If the CUP were so good to minorities, why didn't the rebellious nature of the Armenians stop? 

LOL... great question... The ARF and CUP worked together to overthrow the previous Sultan. For a time, they DID stop. Only in 1914, when WWI restarted, that's when tensions came up again, and ARF violence kicked into high gear when it was determined that the Russians were coming to help.

&gt;They already enjoyed semi-autonomy after all.

They did, which is why things were relatively calm in 1913 for Armenians aside from in the Balkans. Then WWI came.

The CUP was literally the most enlightened group of Turks there were: they called them the Young Turks because they were educated revolutionaries. 

&gt;The CUP, which always greatly admired Japan for modernising itself after the so-called Meiji Restoration of 1867–68

&gt;To the CUP, for whom science was something of a religion, the Japanese example seemed to show how the Ottoman Empire could embrace the science of the west without losing its Islamic identity.

&gt;The CUP professed to be fighting for the restoration of the democratic 1876 constitution

&gt;. Other parties represented in parliament at this time included the Armenian nationalist Dashnak and Hunchak parties

Dashnak = ARF. Hunchak the other Armenian rebel group. Rebels were given representation in the parliament.  Unheard of.

2465,"&gt;That may be true but median age is not the same as life expectancy.

Who said it is? However, there's a strong correlation between average life expectancy and median age. 

&gt; The countries that have a very high median age also have serious problems with a very low fertility rate

Why exactly is a low fertility rate a ""serious problem""? It may very well be the opposite, as there is also a strong correlation between the Human Development Index and the fertility rate. Ceteris paribus, that means that people with better education, higher disposable income and a higher average life expectancy have fewer children.

A higher median age only is a problem for countries that don't know how to adapt to it. Japan and Germany know it and do that, for instance - that's why both of those countries are the leaders in things like industrial automation (i.e. productivity) and savings rates.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/c11clk/median_age_in_europe_in_2017/eranqho/,ColourFox,1560648605

2519,"You are what, 15 years old, US citizen? Your complaints about US- or developing world- style unregulated capitalism are semi-valid. 

But this does not make (even late) USSR a good or valid solution. You should be old enough to understand that you can't treat syphilis with cholera. Compare with something sane, like Euro-socialism, that includes an actual let's-not-die-in-the-streets safety net, and that cholera might look a bit less attractive. Or just look North, eh? 

Do you honestly believe in the BS that Reagan snapped his fingers and USSR fell to dust? No, the thing was rotten to the core on its own, and its still-standing corpse was torn apart by local party lords that got tired of being too equal. 

&gt;I completely ignore the actual work conditions of Soviet workers but I try to state that they were underpaid because they couldn't buy tons of useless, falsely diversified, western bullshit while instead they just got some boring free housing, free healthcare, free university,... 

You just have no bloody clue, aren't you? 

Underpaid, yes. Physical labor was slightly overvalued, while all other labor, regardless of how qualified, was grossly undervalued. That resulted in screwed up salary scale, not paying anyone more than the basic proletariat salary. [Salaries in 1970s-1980s were as follows [RU]](https://finance.rambler.ru/money/40440503-u-kogo-v-sssr-byla-samaya-vysokaya-zarplata/?updated): Factory worker, starting off (not yet any sort of supervisor or a qualified specialist): 180-250 rub/mo. Engineer, starting off after university: 65-125 rub/mo; topped off at 170. Teachers and physicians topped off at ~150. Medical nurse: 80 rub/mo. Janitor: 60-80 rub/mo. The guy loading/unloading trucks in the store: 100 rub/mo. Party members and highest officer ranks topped off around 500-700 rub/mo but they also got a lot of bonuses on the side (free autos with drivers, luxury apartments, summer houses, members-only grocery stores and hospitals). 

Don't start me on the ""safety culture"" in the workplace. HBO's ""Chernobyl"" is not an exaggeration.

Does that sound like utopia or even sanity to you?

Survivable minimum was around 30-40 rub/mo; stipend for a  university student in good standing, milk, bread, soft cheese diet.
That meant more disposable income than in modern Russia but way less for most than in actual developed countries. And you could not buy much with that money anyway.

Things people could not buy included not just consumerist crap or semi-luxury items like cars or motorcycles, but a lot of everyday things you take for granted. Durable clothes. Non-leaking shoes. Reliable washers or dryers. Detergents that actually work. Baby food. Feminine hygiene products... did not exist as such. I hope you are female (or have seen one) and can imagine the glory of rolling your own from hard-to-get medical cotton padding and cheesecloth, then stuffing yourself with *that* every month. Extracting was even more interesting, with sepsis a distinct possibility.

I can go on and on. This is how many fucks the government gave about the material needs of its citizens. 

Education was OK (or good if you tested well). Not much choice of the program/classes. Oh, and a lot of boring AF dialectic materialism and Marxism-Leninism, much like you have your ""equality in basket-weaving"" mandatory bullshit classes. 

Medicine was... variable. Moscow, Leningrad, capitals of the republics - could be good if you knew where to go. Otherwise, no. May Soviet dentists get a permanent place in your dreams. Or provincial hospitals with *S.aureus*-filled paint flakes gently raining down in Ob/Gyn wards. In fact, the healthcare was so ""good"" that high-ranking party members (Obkom Secretary level and above) had their own private medical care system, unavailable to mere mortals. 

You got free housing alright, but it was not yours, it was government's. No private property, remember? A room in the dorm or communal apartment when you get your job. After 10-20 years in the queue that got magically longer in front of you from time to time. Your factory/institution/etc. was your landlord, you leave - you lose it. 

Then you finally got your glorious 31 m^3 1-bedroom in khrushchevka somewhere in Dalniye Yebenya (2-3 hours commute to work). After that, you had to go back into line and beg bureaucrats for extra rooms whenever you had the audacity of having children (this time the line was shorter). 2nd+ turn took months to year in the provinces, or few-several years in big cities. Roaches came free of charge (effective poisons appeared only post-1991). The trash chute acted as roach highway even if you managed to somehow kill off yours.

&gt;I ignore that men retired at 60 and women at 55, and that they enjoyed longer vacations than the average American worker. 

For much of late USSR period, average life expectancy was ~63 years for men (good luck enjoying your retirement) and ~73 years for women (yay). So yes, good enough for the babushkas at least, but not on the level of developed countries (excuse me for not including US in this set). The life on basic pension was OK but not great (unless you had help from your relatives or a plot of land). Elderly people traveling all around enjoying life is a Western thing, it did not happen much in USSR. As things rotted away, it got worse rapidly. Old people begging for change in the underground and digging in the trash containers. Before 1991 too. 

&gt;I live in a system where you could be born as clever as Leonardo da Vinci but if your parents can't afford to pay your higher education, you'll end up working in a fast food, and I'm miserable enough to say that free education was ""just crumbs"".

I won't even deride the US for this one. Most states (besides the several that time forgot AL/MS/MO/LA etc.) have decent state colleges with financial aid. Being Leonardo da Vinci, your SAT is probably decent. Go get that scholarship instead of idealizing things you've never seen. Developed countries with better HDI have it even better, believe me.

&gt;I vomit delirious bullshit about Soviet scientists based upon nothing and forget how Soviet space engineering was years ahead western one's.

Space, yes, space. The recipe for success was as follows: take away a chunk of wealth from everyone, concentrate all effort on weapons programs instead of making citizens' lives better. Spare no expense of ICBMs, half-return the rocket scientists and aircraft engineers back from labor camps. [This is Who Is Who of the Soviet airspace industry and some sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharashka#Notable_sharashka_inmates): also the list of inmates of *sharashkas*, camps for those engineers and scientists.
Then realize you can use ICBMs to send man to space. Isn't Lord USSR great, just like Lord Elon Musk? Wait, no. At least with Musk the whole scheme is more or less consensual. 

&gt;I live in a system where 26 people own as much as the poorest 3,8-FUCKING-BILLION people, and I'm ridicolous enough to say that Soviet economic system was inefficient.""

And in the other corner we have 1 Soviet government acting as a super-rich feudal/capitalist, owning everything, while its 280M wage slaves own mostly things inside their apartments. That's roughly the same proportion or worse. 

You also didn't understand what I said about inefficiency. Creating unneeded, flawed products, letting things rot away, having no incentive to save on time, materials, or energy. ""Овощебаза"" is an interesting place, where the food came to die. Yearly mandatory 2-4 weeks in institutes and universities to ""help the workers of the countryside"". Instead of doing your highly qualified job, you went to dig rotten potatoes out of the mud, because agriculture in its entirety was left to rot and the tractor driver is drunk again. Ever seen several DSci/Professors shovel waist-deep cow shit out of the pens while breathing 1% ammonia vapors? This is not something you should see in a sane world.

Above and below, unlike you, I talk about things I have seen with my own eyes. I buried three General Secretaries and watched too much fucking Swan Lake on TV in 1991. That list of Politburo members is like Satanic prayer that just won't go away. 

People who have seen USSR with their own eyes know what I am talking about. You don't, be thankful for that.",⚑ the glory of Chaos ⚑,/r/europe/comments/c0wew8/moscow_state_university_both_at_day_and_at_night/erateye/,Idiocracy_Cometh,1560652502

The seats are made to have a trapezoidal footprint, that way they can tessellate densely on a curved line. Now because the “thin” side is the side with the back of the seat, the seats must face looking away from the focus of that arc to go around the wall how they do.

But anyone could’ve just found a seat meant to go the other way, easily. Or just use a seat with a square footprint and accept the decrease in seating for the increased function (seeing the lake). Or just don’t put a seat on the ledge (though skaters may use this to do tricks on them).

But from the mass media and meany people's perspective GDL legacy is lithuania's, because that's how people where taught at school that's what people see on youtube and internet, websites and I can show meany videos with more then 100k views, that's how people see on TV and no one is contesting different information except particular individuals.

I dont want to debate if its true or not. What I want to say which I know is 100% true - It is just projecting information on mass scale and it is not contested, Of which I make assumption that Lithuania's legacy is GDL as accepted by the Media, Institutions..., but I call it in general the world, of which you said is not important, but it is unimaginably more important then what you said, that ""that's not how History was"". No one is going to investigate thousands of parameters of how history was or investigate the truth, or your opinion. There is 0 problems in Media communicating GDL's legacy to Lithuania.

Way before Union of Lublin, way after Union of Krėva.

*The Congress of Lutsk was a diplomatic gathering held in Lubart's Castle in Lutsk, Grand Duchy of Lithuania over a 13-week period beginning on January 6, 1429. The main topic of discussion was the coronation of Vytautas as King of Lithuania. Other topics included: the siege of Moldavia; a potential coalition against the Ottoman Empire; the desire for improved relations between Denmark and the Hanseatic League; religious unions and divisions; as well as various economic, trade, and tax-related issues.*

*King Sigismund of Luxemburg encouraged the crowning of Vytautas as King of Lithuania. He was interested in dividing Lithuania and Poland, with a separate kingdom of Lithuania, to reduce the influence of Poland.*

&gt;Yeah, there's that. But even then, you do have that historical qualm you mention plus the one I know, but it doesn't seem very heavy to me, certainly nothing on the level we in Balkans have, and I often see Poles and Lithuanians getting along, so I doesn't seem like anything drastic to me.

The next criminal code, of 1926, didn't have it either. Nickolay Semashko, then the Commissar of Health of the Soviet Union, explicitly stated that decriminalization of homosexuality was a deliberate choice of the party. It happened alongside the decriminalization of incest and legalization of abortions.

2985,"Aight my man at least you own it. 

Thing is germany isn‘t all too well off from what I‘ve heard. Berlin has huge crime rates and is literally ruled by arab gangs and mobsters. Unemployment rate has risen to 20% last time I checked and the AfD got voted into parlament. 

Unemployment rate of young adults in Spain is at a whopping 50% and Greece literally declared bankruptcy a few years ago. Turkey is ruled by a fundamentalist lunatic and Russia is as corrupt and shady as it has always been. Oh and don‘t forget the recent protests in France for better social security which lead to absolutely nothing. Just one more socioeconomic problem aside from the huge ghettos they‘re struggling with. Britain is just as polarised as the US over Brexit and Scandinavia is currently fighting rising crime rates from all the refugees they took in.

So while you are jerking your own dick in one of the worlds smallest countries because things are going relatively well the rest of europe fights the same problems as the US of A. Maybe the US statistics look worse but that may be due to the fact that we are half of europes population crammed into one country. Oh and besides let‘s just think a second where all of Switzerlands wealth comes from:
Selling weapons while acting neutral in all past wars.
Not being held accountable for Nazi warcrimes and reparations while still licking Hitlers boots during the war. Not joining the EU but signing 100 bilateral contracts so they only get to have the upsides of foreign trade while the poor states stay poor.

And so I ask you in your bottomless arrogance what would be your first order as president of the united states? What steps would have to take? What obstacles would you have to overcome? You have no fucking clue and neither do I. There are people in American politics way smarter than you and I and they couldn‘t do shit because it‘s not that fucking easy.

That being said there are still people in this country who live a happy live even though they were denied  good education or healthcare. They are still proud of their heritage and very well aware of their problems and just because you were born with a silverspoon up your ass you don‘t get to shit on these people.

Feel free to apply to become a mod here; after you've found out what it's like for yourself, then you can call us ""lazy"" all you want. Deal?

This is a classic logical fallacy attack called a false dichotomy. I reject this premise.

The core point is valid when made by any observer. You seek to invalid my observation simply because I am not a moderator. It is like saying I cannot criticise President Trump unless I too have experienced being President. This obviously false and worse it seeks to aggrandise your opinion while minimizing mine.

I believe megathreads are a work reduction technique that trample on the rights of users. This is proven by your own data: from ""1.2 fpm"" to a total of 4 followups with such images since the megathread started. 

You shut it down through laziness. Users enjoyment of this sub - as demonstrated by both posts and  upvotes - has been curtailed by your actions.

3154,"A few points there:

**Trade deals**
   
a) yes, if we leave the EU we can negotiate trade deals with anyone who wants to negotiate with us. Things to remember are 
   
a) We are a medium sized country so when we negotiate trade deals we'll get sat on by the larger countries (USA, China, India etc) - see Patrick Lamy [here] (https://youtu.be/Z6LVNpfES8k) and Tony Blair [here] (https://twitter.com/Independent/status/1134480402561753088/video/1) it's neither furious nor a tirade but explains the situation pretty clearly.
      
b) Trade deals typically take years to finalise - what happens to UK trade in the meantime?    
   
c) &gt; that can't be vetoed by French farmers or Belgian villages - French farmers and Belgian villages can't veto anything the UK wants to do and never have been able to.
   
   
**Options**
   
There are three options available, the three I mentioned before. BJ has said that we'll leave the EU on 31st October come what may and he always does what he says, right? I mean it's not that he's know as a liar or anything (only been sacked for it twice). So he may well try to leave with No Deal. If that's the case then there exists the real possibility that, before 31st October, Parliament holds a No Confidence motion and the government is defeated which then leads to a General Election. Still leaves the messy situation that someone would have to ask for an extension from BXL and I'm yet not entirely clear how that would work.
   
**The Backstop**
   
   
Or, as you put it, &gt;their wretched backstop
Is simply a mechanism to ensure the border remains open and the Good Friday Agreement (a legally binding treaty that the UK signed up to) is respected. If it came into force it would mean the UK remains in a Customs Union with the EU until a trade deal is struck. That would, of course, mean that the UK would not be free to negotiate it's own trade deals whilst in that Customs Union. SO the idea is to get the trade talks sorted before the backstop happens.
Remember the UK negotiated that agreement on the backstop and signed up to it, the EU never 'poisoned' it.",,/r/europe/comments/bzqmdz/brexit_leaked_cabinet_note_admits_uk_not_ready/er8kmnh/,sovietmule,1560606528

3157,"Okay, I wanted to know this better too. Apparently, it seems like this is only a hypothesis mentioned in a copy and paste article in some German newsletters. So I don't know it is really true or not. 

&gt; The superseers are the mothers or daughters of men with color vision impairment.
Such a constellation is conceivable among the female relatives of men with colour vision impairment - and only among women. The visual pigment for the red and green cones is coded on the X chromosome. This sex chromosome is present twice in women, but only once in men. Therefore, mothers and daughters of colour vision patients could develop both visual pigments at once: The mutated of her male relative and a healthy one. They would then be so-called ""tetrachromats"".

&gt;At least genetically, tetrachromasia can be determined quite reliably. Jordan found some women who actually have the predisposition for all four visual pigments. However, her initial optimism was bitterly disappointed: ""Not every genetic carrier also has special abilities,"" she says, ""It is not enough that the mutated cone is simply stuck in the retina. It must also be optimally placed between the red and green cones.

Having a school uniform (where possible) has an important role in the learning environment.Firstly it's about simple discipline and learning it from a young age.
Secondly it's actually more about bringing the students together as a group and focusing on the learning aspect,rather than who has the ""most swag"" and other social dynamics of the sort it inherently brings(especially the younger you are, you tend to ""want"" what others have by simple curiosity).

While you could say ""but it doesn't matter,you're at school to learn so it's pointless in what clothes you're coming in"" and you'd be right, it was a crucial part (mostly in the past) in shaping how people went about learning in their environments,specially the public ones.

I had an uniform, and damn i thought myself 24/7 it was the most communistic thing ever,specially in a similar case where you had to wear pants in 30C+ every summer.But now almost a decade later i realised how important (mostly in it's symbolism) it was and how indirectly it shapes you.And while this may be a subjective view since it was my childhood, it applies to more people often than not.

&gt; The thought that a small group of people own more money than the rest of the world should be disgusting.  

Why? It's called the Pareto principle and that's how everything is distributed in society, starting from artistic talent, most kills achieved in an aerial fight, productivity, sales made by salesman, healthcare spending in terms of patients, etc.  
Also ever thought about that maybe those people added more value to the world than others? Providing jobs to millions of people versus being a single programmer? Do you think it's disgusting people are fairly rewarded based on their contribution to society?

&gt; For starters just look at what is happening around the world today  

Ye, you won't read it, so just look at the pretty graphs in Pinker's book, or if that's too much, look at the pretty graphs in an article about Pinker's book. Capitalism is the best thing that happened to the poorest people in the history of the world, ever.

3397,"What Leopold II did in Congo was without doubt horrible and there is no justification for it. However, I see the ""10 millions dead Congolese"" figure often repeated in this thread. I'd just want to bring a bit more caution with that figure.

10 million is a number that is often cited but isn't grounded in much reality. It is highly likely that the death toll is counted in millions, but how many is hard to say.

The figure of 10 million comes from accounts from observers that the population decreased by half during this period. Just observations from people there, not based on a census or anything (one could say: anecdotal evidence). Then, according to one British pacifist activist who ran a campaign against the Congo Free State and Leopold II, the initial population was 20 millions. Again, no census, I wonder where he got that number from. So, it was deducted that there were approximately 10 million deaths.

As you see, these numbers are to be taken with a grain of salt, especially as Congo is covered by rain forest and it is unlikely that these observers went to all the small tribes and villages in that enormous country.

It also completely ignores the fact that there were epidemics of malaria and sleeping sickness at the time, which can't be attributed to Leopold II but probably largely contributed to the death toll.

I refer to this page for other estimations of Congo's decline in population during the Congo Free State: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State#Death_toll

To conclude, this comment is in no way meant to absolve Leopold II of what he did. It is basically certain that millions died from his rule.

&gt;Tradition has maintained that the Danish flag appeared at the Battle of Lyndanisse on 15 June 1219.[2] Legend holds that during the battle, in the Danes' hour of need, the Dannebrog fell from the sky and gave them renewed hope. As the Estonians attacked the Danish stronghold, the Danes were hard pressed. Anders Sunesen, the Archbishop of Lund, raised his hands to the sky in prayer, and the defenders held tight as long as his hands were raised. As Archbishop Sunesen became exhausted, he eventually had to lower his arms, and the Estonians were on the verge of victory.[3] Then, a red flag with a white cross fell from the sky, and gave the Danes the victory.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/c0tu6j/on_this_day_800_years_ago_the_danish_flag/er7fv9a/,espionagejunkman,1560576857

3489,"&gt;But there are also active malignant forces working against European unity, and there are existing economic relationships on which the European peoples depend for their standard of life and which are not compatible with true Socialism. I list what seem to me to be the four main obstacles, explaining each of them as shortly as I can mange:
&gt;
    1. Russian hostility. 
The Russians cannot but be hostile to any European union not under their own control. The reasons, both the pretended and the real ones, are obvious. One has to count, therefore, with the danger of a preventive war, with the systematic terrorizing of the smaller nations, and with the sabotage of the Communist Parties everywhere. Above all there is the danger that the European masses will continue to believe in the Russian myth. As long as they believe it, the idea of a Socialist Europe will not be sufficiently magnetic to call forth the necessary effort.
&gt;
    2. American hostility. 
If the United States remains capitalist, and especially if it needs markets for exports, it cannot regard a Socialist Europe with a friendly eye. No doubt it is less likely than the U.S.S.R. to intervene with brute force, but American pressure is an important factor because it can be exerted most easily on Britain, the one country in Europe which is outside the Russian orbit. Since 1940 Britain has kept its feet against the European dictators at the expense of becoming almost a dependency of the U.S.A. Indeed, Britain can only get free of America by dropping the attempt to be an extra-European power. The English-speaking Dominions, the colonial dependencies, except perhaps in Africa, and even Britain's supplies of oil, are all hostages in American hands. Therefore there is always the danger that the United States will break up any European coalition by drawing Britain out of it.

Portugal is still in NATO they didn't leave when the fascists lost. Makes your complain about ""supporting China"" a little hollow.

3572,"On the particular example I gave, Caprivi (Bismarck’s successor) had this to say to Bismarck when he was deciding to let the (highly secret) Russo-German pact lapse:

&gt;“A man such as yourself,” Caprivi informed Bismarck, “can juggle five balls at the same time, while other people do well to limit themselves to one or two balls.”

Bismarck is widely acknowledged to have been one of the most brilliant statesmen in history – he had an almost obscene talent for reading circumstances and reacting accordingly. He was an excellent negotiator, diplomat, and politician. He took Prussia (widely seen as the least of the Great Powers of the day, save for Italy) to form Germany by force where everybody had assumed that German unification would come about either by liberal assault or Austrian leadership.  

The Russo-German pact was highly secret because (1) the German public would have hated it; and (2) the Austrians would have been outraged. Bismarck rarely let public opinion govern his actions (militant liberals and the right wing German press were the dual bane  of his existence). He also understood that the value of each treaty was not in the agreement itself, but in ensuring that Germany was closer to every other state (save France) than they were to each other. 

Caprivi let the Russian agreement lapse because he was much more sensitive to public opinion, and because he looked at it through the lens of traditional alliances. It’s not a perfect parallel, but imagine how a secret German-Russian treaty would be viewed today given Russia’s clashes with NATO and the US. It takes a special level of self-belief and insight to run a risk like that for some benefit that is not immediately clear.",Australia,/r/europe/comments/c0mevv/bismarck_system_of_alliances_in_europe_during_2nd/er785ul/,ESVVCLP2,1560570192

Like one of the reasons the issue happened was that they couldn’t reduce power output that much at a certain time because factories needed power to run factories at the end of the month to fill quotas. So even when they needed to reduce power they didn’t at certain points in time.

It’s an interesting example of a centrally planned economy vs a market economy. In a normal system, the factories and the power plant are unrelated parties just trying to do business with each other. You wouldn’t ever put power output above the safe amount even if the factory wanted you to because you would put your whole power plant at risk.

3596,"Kissinger is a fascinating figure – I can’t decide what to make of him. Brilliant, brilliant thinker. But sometimes you come to the conclusion that his brand of politics is self-perpetuating. And his theoretical framework is so high level that human life is assigned really little or no value. Domestic social and political movements are meaningless unless they detract from foreign policy goals, in which case they need to be annihilated. I started reading through declassified material related to him – phone conversations and the like – after going through a number of his books. He is a genuinely terrifying man. But brilliant all the same. 

*On China* really feels like the last gasp of the China doves, especially in the present context. I strongly recommend you follow through with *Diplomacy* when you finish with it. *Diplomacy* is undoubtedly his magnum opus.

As to your question – I put it the other way around. He disliked them. After 1871, Germany’s right-wing press started pushing a particularly chest-thumping brand of politics. Germany deserved a “place in the sun” – its overseas Empire was not even remotely commensurate with its newfound importance. 

Bismarck’s priority was maintaining a balance of power in Europe – he thought aggression against other European powers for overseas colonies was a ridiculous flight of fancy. Germany was too big and too powerful to go around threatening its neighbours – the moment they saw it as a threat they were likely to band together against it (this touches on the so-called *German Question* concerning Germany’s role in Europe, which is still relevant today). He was forced to cave on the issue a number of times as popular opinion moved against him.

3718,"FYI, Ottoman Empire was ally of Swedish Empire in a sense. The Swedish King lived in Istanbul during things going on Sweden. 
It's very much like Sweden desperate of help of Ottoman Empire. 

I'd suggest you to read a book called Greek Revolution by George Finlay. It will help you to understand and learn more about Turkish and Greek history. You may 'believe' things but I don't think it's ethical to blame a nation without having any strong evidence. 

First of all, Greek Kingdom invaded Anatolia. They have committed many crimes. My grandfather's uncle was kidnapped by Greek Soldiers, and probably murdered. 
So all these things ok, but when you lost a war and drawn back where you came from Turks are genociders.

About Armenian thing, even prominent historians like Bernard Lewis call it 'not genocide'. I can explain it million times but you  will still believe what you want. However those who reads it at least can grasp a bit of information.

During WW1 Armenians in Eastern Anatolia caused a lot of problems. And during that time there were many Armenian officials in Ottoman Empire such as Treasury Minister himself. When the tension in East risen, the Government had to do something to cease the conflict immediately. Therefore heads of Armenian community has been called, but they have been asked an independent state which is not acceptable. They didn't cooperate with the government. Thus, some Armenians jailed, so they were not able to help those who are rebelling in Eastern regions. Ottoman Empire had nothing but has to have a concise decision to end the killings of Armenian gangs. So, in specific regions Armenians temporarily sent to other states of Ottoman Empire such as Syria. Syria is not full desert as it's depicted. But still it's sad that those people had to leave where they live, but the empire didn't have any chose. Another thing os in records it states those who are sent due to security reasons will have right to return their home. However after the WW1, Syria and other states of the empire fell under French and British administration. To make legit of invasion Anatolia, British Empire started a lawcase against Ottoman Officers and those were sent to Malta. But, there were not able to find any legit proof.",,/r/europe/comments/c0ns5e/proposed_balkan_federation_by_soviet_war_minister/er72nzr/,blgram,1560565027

”Before the class begins, you must know that Ottoman Empire contributed nothing to the world and they were absolutely worthless!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, neo Ottomanist, black Turkish man who had served in the army for 1500 hours and understood that Ottomans did nothing wrong stood up and showed a picture of Hagia Sophia

”Who built this, giaour?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite whiteoidly and smugly replied “Greeks of course, it's a Byzantine church. Stupid T*rk”

”Wrong. It was built by Turks. If it were indeed a Byzantine church, built by Greeks.... then why does it have minarets, why would Greeks build them?”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Bible. He stormed out of the room crying those crocodile tears. The same tears nazis cry for the “poor Kurds” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned land from the Turks. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Alexander Atzkipoulos, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist white nationalist professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment. But he forgot that there are strict gun laws in his communist union!

The students applauded and all applied for Turkish citizenship that day and accepted Allah as their lord and savior and converted to Islam. An double eagle called ""Selçuklu"" flew into the room, perched atop the Greek flag and shat on it. ""Allahu Ekber"" was shouted several times, and Murad IV himself showed up enacted an alcohol tax across the European Union.

&gt; That's not correct anymore as with the raising of Budgets and the 2% target it's more likely Germany has some Billions to throw at that project. Eurofighter Typhoon was very unlucky with the End of the Cold War.


Then after I said Germany would never reach that 2% target you said this 

&gt;Because is unrealistic und stupid. We have serious problems that need to solve first, like personell. We want to 210.000, but can't get over 183.000 Money could help, but we talking about having the largest budget by far in Europe and the third or fourth largest in World. Let Germany work with 1,5% and we can talk if want an Invasion force for Russia.


So you first said that Germany will be spending more money because of the 2% figure, then you say the 2% figure is never going to happen because it’s unrealistic and stupid. So why did you bring it up in the first place if we know that Germany will never reach 2%?


Meanwhile, I gave you a New York Times link saying that under current budget figures German military spending is going to fall back to 1.23% by 2023, so it won’t even reach the 1.5% you just mentioned. You can’t even say “let Germany work with 1.5%” if you’re not even going to get to 1.5%. You’re claiming credit for things that Germany isn’t doing and has no plans on actually doing in the future. 


This is the purpose of the GDP numbers. It creates accountability. We need a method to measure and determine objectively and without excuses or arguments whether a country is doing enough with its military. The 2% GDP number is the best way to do that, and that’s why the German government agreed  when to agreed to spend 2%.

You say building dozens of nuclear plants makes no sense. But does building all solar and wind make sense? Those also don't have an endless lifespan and will be replaced over time again.

The storage solutions for renewables are not perfect. Using hydro is not possible for all (otherwise we would be using it today to power all of Europe) and the thermal storage you are talking about is not there yet also, or is mostly for heating and not storing massive amounts of electricity like we need.

We don't need to perfect solar and wind, we need to perfect storage. And I could very well be wrong, but as of now I don't see that happening in 15 years, while we do have the designs ready for nuclear plants to fit perfectly in the power setup we have today with no changes needed. So considering we really need to do this stuff in the next 15-20 years if not sooner, I rather see European countries start building nuclear plants to fit in our current system, while also continue building our solar and wind options.

3939,"&gt;The German Army has 62,000 men. During the Cold War it had 400,00 men when the population of Germany

That shows your research and knowledge is shallow. During the Cold war we had 3 branches. Now we have SKB, CIR and ZSanDstBw additionally, which are mostly supports group. Reducing the numbers especially from the army. 

Additionally the army is full professional against a conscript army during the Cold War. 

Than what has the percentage of GDP to do with how well a army function. UK has nearly similar cost in everything (Living Standards)  and way smaller GDP compare to population.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita

That is one reason why measuring with GDP is non-sense. 
It is to low, but not much and it's only indirect the reason for many problems. For example in the Cold War areas, the German armed forces had many spare parts. To save money, very smart people thought of on demand spare parts for military equipment. That is one of biggest problems, why many complex system are not ready. Another thing is they cut down Ammo depots, because too much ammunition did rot away and to save cost they closed a lot. Some bought back and are reopening. Another thing is Regulation, the German lawmaker likes to apply civil laws to stuff like tanks to the German armed forces, which makes stuff quite quick un-operational. 

Than we have desaster like Euro-Hawk, Gorch Fock, Privatization of Clothes LHBW(bough back, because it went bankrupt), civil cars BW Fuhrback( cost more than before Bundesrechnunghof has paper about it),  partially repairs HIL (the soldier have nothing to do anymore) and civil IT part of the Bundeswehr, partly even now military systems ( which leaves many it personal without anything and is a strange concept of IT-Security). But to Scrap those again and arguably save a lot of money no. 

External Civilian companies costing a lot and with no clear effect etc.

You see a lot of problems were created due money saving, but mostly enough is there to fix it. It just gets wasted in other means.

3969,"The reason that the F-35 was off the table for Germany was because France is against it. France needs Germany as a partner for a new joint plane and the German government didn’t want to piss France off in the spirit of Franco-German cooperation. If Germany bought the F-35 then those planes will be flying for the next 30 years and that would make it impossible for Germany to also be part of any new French-German plane. The new project is called SCAF. Same reason that Macron got so mad when Belgium bought the F-35. Every new sale of the F-35 makes development of a new European jet that much harder. 


The problem is that any new SCAF plane won’t be ready for 20 years and Germany’s Air Force is falling apart right now and needs new planes. Furthermore, the SCAF project might very well never happen. These projects need to produce a certain number of planes to be economically viable, but with so many European countries already buying the F-35 then the project may never get off the ground. 

These projects also tend to go hugely overbudget and have huge political issues. Same way that France pulled out of the Eurofighter project midway through last time they tried to do this.


What’s probably going to happen is that a few years from now, when Macron and Merkel are no longer in power, Germany is just going to buy the F-35 anyway. That just can’t happen for political reasons while Macron and Merkel are having a Pro-Eu partnership and while Trump is the US president.


3,000 F-35s are going to be built, that’s what drives the cost per plane down. The Eurofighter is just as expensive despite being a 4th generation plane because only 600 Eurofighters were built. Modern European military budgets are way smaller than they were when the Eurofighter rolled out and way fewer countries are available to buy some new Franco-German plane because they’ve already bought the F-35. So there’s nearly no way they can secure enough orders to develop a brand new plane just with France and Germany, meanwhile the F-35 can be bought right now. 


Germany isn’t looking at France’s nukes. They were basically trolling Macron with that. What does that even mean? They just would expect Macron to give them a button to fire some nukes? All those nukes are on French submarines.

The overall mood had no doubt been that expulsing Germans is just the only way to fulfill their wish they were chanting since 1938: [Wir wollen Heim ins Reich!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heim_ins_Reich) while keeping our historical borders. And that after extermination camps, (operation Anthropoid reprisals)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Anthropoid#Consequences] and such things, peaceful coexistence is impossible.

3998,"&gt;Lemme tell you something: when your own countrymen openly call Russians (born in Estonia or present in it at the time of the establishment of its modern iteration) undesirable in their country, I need no propaganda. Your compatriots' views, honestly expressed on the Internet, are the best propaganda that exists out there. That's what I take at face value.

I'd expect one to be able to tell the difference between public opinion and comments made by anonymous users on the internet. 

On that point, I advise you to search for ""Pribaltika"" or any individual Baltic countries on Russian YouTube. Majority of videos are political propaganda about imminent collapse of economy, war-mongering Baltics, catastrophic emigration and what not. Yet I understand there are 140+ million Russians, I can't generalize.

&gt; How about looking at possible solutions for the sake of solving the problem? I really hope your politicians aren't turning down solutions just because it might be pleasing for that dastardly Putin or those dastardly progressives.

Do you think it's not constantly being debated? Of course it is. The citizenship-on-demand for those born in independent Estonia is one fruit of it.

However, in the end, it comes to the point where we are just stubborn to demand knowledge of language. There are, for example, language-learning programs to support that, but it won't magically make everybody learn it. 

&gt;See, this is the cornerstone of the problem and the reason it's not solvable today. 

It is solvable, it is being solved, just very slowly. 

&gt;Ethnic Russians' argument is that the country was established with them present in it, and 1 out of 4 is a damn sizeable minority that deserves its language recognized as official in the country. This makes sense de facto. 

It doesn't make sense *de facto*, it's just your opinion. What you're saying is essentially rewarding Russia for colonizing its neighbours. As long as you plant enough of your countrymen, they *must* be recognized, their language *must* be recognized. There's a reason such plantation of your countrymen into occupied territories is illegal according to the Geneva convention. So I would be careful with the ""deserve"" argument here.

The very problem is if you think it's totally okay to forget how Russians arrived there and claim doing so is ""fascist"". It's not just some historical irrelevancy, it happened quite recently and while natives were being oppressed. It also means most of these people have no roots here. 

This leads to absolutely idiotic and hypocritical situations where you have some Lyudmila from Saratov and Anatoly from Omsk screaming and rioting over Red Army monument in Tallinn, despite the fact that they, nor their forefathers, even lived here during the events. You have immigrants trying to dictate to natives how they should remember their own history, just because now they live here. I mean, it's like the same as some random Muslim moving here and demanding to remove these crosses from churches, as they are irritated by those. Nah, bye!

&gt;Contrary to that, you have the argument that Estonia (or Latvia) is a continuation of the country that was there pre-1940. This makes sense de jure (but why ethnic Russians, as obvious invaders, were allowed to remain in it, doesn't). The option taken and defended like a holy relic by respective governments is obvious, therefore the problem. 

Russians were allowed to stay because the values of the era were such to never consider such an extreme move of expelling so many people. Besides, many thought Russians would just go back where they came from.

And yes, it's a strong position because we refuse to accept a foreign dictatorship to come make a random coctail here and expect us to swallow it all. This includes restoring our language the status it hold before an aggressor occupied us. I'm sorry some Russians are caught in between, but it's Moscow to blame, not us. We never invited them here, we never invited USSR here.

Approximately [1.5 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-rights/1-5-million-muslims-could-be-detained-in-chinas-xinjiang-academic-idUSKCN1QU2MQ)   people, mostly members of the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority, have been   held in detention camps in China’s western region of Xinjiang since   2017. The continuing crackdown on Uighur culture, religion, and   political expression has resulted in a state of terror throughout the   region—and in the destruction of numerous families, with parents,   grandparents, and children often separated.

The  failure of Muslim countries to speak up for their  co-religionists,  thanks to economic ties to China, has been much  commented on. But while  Western countries have been more outspoken on  the plight of the Uighur  people, they have often been hesitant to act  when push comes to  shove—even in countries that pride themselves on  their advocacy of  human rights, such as Belgium.

A tragic  recent case highlights this. Ablimit Tursun, a Uighur from  Urumqi,  Xinjiang, holding Chinese citizenship, was on a business trip to  Turkey  in 2017 when he was informed that his brother had been detained.  His  family in Urumqi warned him not to come back, for fear a similar  fate  could await him. Foreign travel is often used by the Chinese  government  as an excuse to send people to the camps, as is having  relatives  overseas.

Tursun fled to Belgium, where  he was granted asylum in 2018 and now  works full time in a major  Belgian company. He immediately began the  process of applying for a  Belgian family reunification visa for his wife  and four children. The  visa application included a letter describing  the family’s situation as  critical, stressing the risk such an  application put them in and the  need for discretion.

Despite repeated  requests by the family to simplify the visa  proceedings in order to  reduce this risk, the embassy insisted on them  making two trips to  Beijing. By itself, this put the family in danger:  Uighurs traveling  outside of Xinjiang are inherently seen as suspicious,  monitored by  police, and often detained at airports or stations.

On  May 26, Tursun’s wife, Wureyetiguli Abula, and their children (who  are  5, 10, 12, and 17)  secretly flew from Urumqi to Beijing for the   second time to complete the visa application and hand in the last   documents to the Belgian Embassy. They arrived on a late-night flight to   avoid the airport police and checked into a hotel. Since Uighurs are   routinely refused service from hotels, and their visits are often   reported to the police, the hotel was pre-booked by a friend. Still,   less than an hour after their arrival, after they were forced to show ID   to register there, the Beijing police knocked at their door and   interrogated them. Police officers came again the next evening,   intimidating them and encouraging them to return to Urumqi.

Abula  feared that if they were returned to Urumqi, they would be  blocked  from leaving the region again and possibly sent to the camps.  Her fear  turned into panic when Belgian consular officials informed her  the visa  processing could take up to three months and advised that she  wait in  her home in Xinjiang. In fact, the visas were issued a mere two  days  later, but by then the damage was already done. The family refused  to  leave the embassy facilities until the visa application was  processed.

A  long discussion ensued, and security staff ushered the family out into  the embassy’s yard, where they lingered. At  2 a.m., the embassy called  the Chinese police to the embassy facilities  in order to remove the  family. This is an extraordinary measure, only  allowed in the most  exceptional of circumstances.

Abula and  her children were taken to the local police station for a  short  interrogation by Xinjiang police, who had traveled to Beijing, and  the  officers tried to convince them to leave the capital.

As  they refused to return to Urumqi voluntarily, they were put under   house arrest in the hotel for a day. The next day, the Xinjiang police   forcefully entered their room and dragged them into a car. As of June   12, Tursun has not been able to contact his wife and four children for   11 days and has no idea of their whereabouts or health. Friends informed   him that the local police had interrogated all his relatives in Turpan   and Urumqi, had searched his home, and had taken away the family’s   electronic devices. Those relatives may, in turn, be at risk of being   sent to the camps.

Abula and her  children’s experience was typical of the oppression,  discrimination,  and absence of freedom experienced by many ordinary  Uighurs in China.  Abula was not able to travel freely to Beijing, she  could not herself  buy a ticket for travel out of Xinjiang, and she could  not book a hotel  room. The mere presence of a middle-aged woman and her  children drew  the attention of several police officers.

But  there are also serious concerns raised by the behavior of the  Belgian  Embassy, which showed reckless carelessness and a lack of   responsibility. The Belgian Embassy was repeatedly informed of the   danger it would pose to Abula and her children to have to travel to   Beijing several times at different occasions, yet still they insisted.   Not only was a request for refuge at the embassy refused, but embassy   staff also voluntarily called the police in the middle of the   night—effectively sealing the fate of a vulnerable family.

Anybody  interested in China knows of the plight of Uighurs. Embassy  staff  should be more aware of it than most—especially those dealing with  a  sensitive visa case. For the staff to deliberately endanger a family   that they had explicitly forced to take a risky journey to the embassy   in the first place was dire incompetence at best, and it hints at deeply   misplaced priorities. In a meeting with Tursun (accompanied by Vanessa   Frangville, one of the present authors), the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs  in Belgium cited Abula’s misunderstanding of Belgian  administrative  procedures and obstinate refusal to leave the embassy to  justify  cooperation with the Chinese police. They rejected Tursun’s  demand to  make the family case a priority in their diplomatic agenda,  considering  that “showing explicit concern would put too much pressure  on China” and  that it would be wise for “a small country like Belgium”  to avoid  turning this case into a conflict with China.

This  instance recalls the case of a young Uighur man who due to a   bureaucratic error was extradited from Germany to China after his asylum   case was refused in spring 2018. Dilshat Adil, 22, had lived in Munich   for six years. He had finished his schooling there, spoke good German,   and had employment. He was arrested by the German police early one   morning and forcefully flown to China, where he vanished. When the   German authorities realized their mistake, they invited him back, but he   has not been heard from since.

As he  had been politically active in Germany and reportedly had  tattooed on  his arm an East Turkestan flag—a symbol of Uighur  independence, which  can be mean the death penalty in China—the chances  of him being safe  are minimal. This failure sits uneasily with the  German government’s  official ideology of promoting human rights. In the  German case, this  had an aftereffect. Following the disappearance of  Adil, Germany and  Sweden ordered a full extradition stop of Uighurs to  China. But nobody  took responsibility of the tragic mistake that had  been made, and  Germany has not, as far as is known, pressed the Chinese  on Adil’s  whereabouts.

European countries that  claim to prioritize human rights need to do  better, both in their  support for the victims of human rights abuses in  China and in  providing support for Uighurs left stranded abroad. The  Chinese state  frequently threatens and coerces Uighurs overseas,  including citizens  of other countries. Europe must do more to protect  them—and to ensure  that the kind of incompetence and cruelty displayed  in the Abula and  Adil cases do not happen again.",,/r/europe/comments/c0ofai/belgiums_beijing_embassy_calls_chinese_cops_on/er67lrj/,poclee,1560541645

4127,"&gt;Yeah.

Why did you ask me then?

&gt;Those two look like women to me

Well neither of them look female to me

&gt;You interact with their present

Don't tell me how I have to interact with people.

&gt;That's...not how that works. Testosterone is a male sex hormone that produces male sex characteristics, estrogen is female sex that produces female sex characteristics. Are you seriously telling me you'd rather call a uterus a ""sex characteristic predominantly occuring in females"" instead of a ""female sex characteristic""?

The quotation marks around female were basically there so you didn't then say something along the lines of ""well if they have female sex characteristics then they're not male then"". A uterus is a female sex characteristic because it *should* only exist on females. Any incident where a uterus exists on a male is the result of problems occurring during devlopment. Of course, I'm not about to say ""sex characteristic predominantly occurring in females"", because of the 0.001% of the population who have Swyer syndrome. If a man grew breasts due to artificially taking estrogen, his breasts would not be female, but that does not mean breasts are not a female sex character, as breasts *should* only occur in females.

&gt;Again, the stereotype of sexual dimorphism?

Defining a man or woman with whether or not they have a Y chromosome is not a stereotype, and I'll explain why.

Woman - Adult human female

Male - Adult human male

Female - Someone without Y chromosomes

Male - Someone with Y chromosomes

Stereotype -a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing

Oversimplified - to describe or explain something in such a simple way that it is no longer correct or true

Saying that men have Y chromosomes and women do not chromosomes is universally true and thus not an oversimplification, and hence it is also not a stereotype.",,/r/europe/comments/c05r9j/russia_has_a_more_progressive_legislation_for/er5vff0/,UnmemorableIdiot,1560534301

4129,"&gt;you are arguing for an investment for a 80 to 130 year time period

Yes, because I don't think renewables (even with its impressive growth over the past years) will be enough.

&gt;World wide energy consumption will go up, in Europe it will go down (electricity's share will go up).

We are talking about electricity generation here. Which means we need more of it since we are throwing millions upon millions of cars on the grid in a few years. So you say it goes up also, so we need even more power generation.

&gt;Who told you that you need nuclear?

It is the easiest source to put in our current grid, is stable and is safe. The resources needed come from friendly countries so the supply will be stable also.

Next to that, in order to run 100% on renewables (which will be solar+wind for most countries, since they lack the environment for hydro) you need to factor in the fluctuations and supply changes. Solar will produce more in summer compared to winter, wind is all over the place depending on the weather. So now you need storage, which means batteries. Which need to be produced with resources that are not exactly environment friendly also, might as well mine uranium. Suddenly the price is a lot more taking that into account.

I'm not arguing for 100% nuclear, I am saying we need it also. Next to that, people are already taking into account future battery tech and further drops in prices for solar and wind, but then we also need to do the same for nuclear.

There are - maybe - arguments to be made that the attack shouldn't have happened. But this is just dishonest. 

From Wikipedia

&gt;In the video on the morning of July 12, 2007, the crews of two United States Army AH-64 Apache helicopters observe a gathering of men near a section of Baghdad in the path of advancing U.S. ground troops, some armed with AKMs and RPGs.[10][14] The crew estimates the group is twenty men.[15] Among the group are two journalists working for Reuters, Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh.[10][16][17][18][19] (While the two are carrying media cards, a military officer claimed they were not wearing distinctive clothing identifying themselves as such.)[20]

&gt;A crew member requests authorization to engage after seeing five or six of the men moving in the direction of U.S. soldiers.[10] A long shadow cast on the ground by a telephoto lens on Noor-Eldeen's camera is misidentified by the pilot as an additional RPG aimed at him and a U.S. Army Humvee directly below his aircraft. One second later he screams, ""He's got an RPG!"" Noor-Eldeen fails to photograph the Apache but three pictures of the U.S. Humvee appear on his camera's memory card when it was recovered by U.S. soldiers. The men become obscured behind a building as the Apache moves around the group.[10] Both helicopters strafe a group of ten men with 30 mm rounds once they became visible again.[9][10][21]

&gt;Seven men were killed, including Noor-Eldeen and Chmagh, with three others being wounded.[10][14][17] Once the group is eliminated, the Apache pilots direct the ground troops to move up to the position of the attack to clear the area.

&gt;Attack on a van
As the ground troops advanced, a wounded Chmagh was seen crawling and attempting to stand.[10][17][22] As the U.S. soldiers moved towards the site of the attack, a van stopped near Chmagh. The van had no visible markings to suggest it was an ambulance or a protected vehicle.[23] The Apache crew alerted the ground troops of the van and requested permission to engage the vehicle before the ground troops arrived. The Apache crew saw unarmed[17] men exit the vehicle and move to Chmagh.[10][17][22] The Apache crew requested permission to engage, stating it ""looks like [the men] possibly, picking up bodies and weapons"" from the scene,[24] and repeated their request to shoot,[7][25][26][27][28] before they received permission to begin firing on the van and its occupants.[10][17][22] Chmagh was killed[10][17][22] along with three other men, while two children, not known to be in the van to the U.S. forces, were injured.[29] The children, a girl and boy, suffered injuries. The girl suffered from a stomach wound and glass in her eyes, and the boy a head injury.[30][31] Just as the van was destroyed, U.S. ground troops made their final turn and arrived on the road with the van. The Apache crew then alerted the ground troops that they believed that they could see an injured child moving around inside the destroyed van. On the video, it is then seen that Army soldiers establish a perimeter around the site and extract the children from the burning van.

&gt;Attack on a building
The ground troops that secured the site of the first two strikes then receive small arms fire from nearby buildings.

&gt;There is a period of 20 minutes not included on the leaked tape.[32] According to the internal legal review, the helicopters engaged a group of armed insurgents, and that some were seen entering a nearby building.[14]

&gt;As the tape resumes, two men, one holding an AK-47, are seen walking. They split up and the footage follows one who appears to be armed.[33] He walks into a building which has been identified as the source of fire at U.S. ground troops. They request permission to fire a missile at the building, describing it as ""abandoned"" or ""under construction"". The ground controller responds, ""If you've [positively identified] the individuals in the building with weapons, go ahead and engage the building"". As the pilot positions the helicopter to attack the building, two unarmed men walk towards, and perhaps into, the building. As the gunner fires the first missile, another man is seen walking along the street in front of the building. The missile hits the building, and the man is caught in the explosion. The crew then reposition the helicopter and fire two more missiles into the upper floors of the building[34]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/c05cuv/sajid_javid_signs_us_extradition_order_for_julian/er5hdys/,thewimsey,1560526073

4200,"&gt; In poor societies money is more important than the perceived advantages of the parent staying home

But the paradox is not about women staying home. It's about going after careers that don't promise big payout. AFAIK nordic countries don't have that low numbers in women participation in labour market. It's just that they dominate fields with lower salaries.

&gt; Your own Wikipedia link discusses the criticism against the ""paradox"".

Yes. It also paints full picture of the paradox. Rather than single sided attempt by some dude to sell books and get booked in conferences.

&gt; Women do chase money, btw. In the fields that offer good money and there's so many women that the employers have no choice but to employ women.

Women in poor countries look into money much more than women in rich countries with good safety net. Some women do go after money even in rich money. But not as many women as in poor countries.

&gt; In poor societies money is more important than the perceived advantages of the parent staying home

&gt; Men don't really fight it either. It needs to change by government policies. I'm expecting the new model will change something. Men will be making the same decisions that women do at the moment.

Germans seem ungrateful while Poland is enthusiastic about NATO so people would rather defend people that like the US over people that don’t even like us. 


I agree with you, that’s not how it should look. It looks weird having Poland offer to pay the US to build a US base in Poland. The US government was taken aback by that offer.

I think what’s happening here is that the Polish government was trying to make a generous offer to the US. The Polish government knows that the US is unhappy that Germany doesn’t care about its military and Germans don’t like US bases. They’re trying to go the extra mile compared to Germany.


If I were a Pole I’d say there should also be a contest for the new plane. I think they didn’t have a contest because they wanted to look good to the US. I also think that it wasn’t a hard decision since lots of other countries are buying the F-35 anyway, even the ones that had contests like Belgium.


But the US is a major arms exporter and we are in the business of exporting weapons. The US government actively promotes weapons sales to allies and you can’t blame the US government for promoting American products. As long as we’re not bribing foreign leaders with money in their personal bank accounts then I’m fine with US promoting sales however they can.

4278,"&gt;What if I don't want one or the other?

They're big tent parties. Vote in the primaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's because it's very unlikely that 5 parties will each have the same  amount of overlap in their ideology. The normal end result in such a  scenario is that the 3 parties most closely resembling each other form  the coalition, leaving out the 2 outliers.

&amp;#x200B;

So the outliers still get left out. So whats the point of PR then?

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Directly elected leaders can lead to celebrity voting. Voting should be about ideas and content, not charm and looks, and thus a vote should go to a party, not a person.

&amp;#x200B;

If the people want celebrity voting then give it to them. They'll learn how that works out. Ronald Reagan was an actor. He had a great presidency. Carter was no celebrity, but was a weak president. Leadership requires ability to communicate with people and inspire confidence, not just ideas and content.

4280,"&gt;&gt; a flat-chested woman with a mannish body wouldn't be a man, would they?

&gt;Under the assumption a woman looks very physically masculine, she'd still introduce and associate herself with other women. In the social exchange, that's sufficient. You're still not doing a physical examination, you're relying on social presentation

I said that in response to you saying ""Stereotypes like women have bodies that are shaped by estrogen and men have bodies that are shaped by testosterone?"", and since this is in the context of appearance, the question is not whether or not women have bodies shaped by estrogen, the question is whether or not women *look* like they have bodies shape by estrogen. The mannish woman example was to illustrate that the idea that women must *look* like they must have a body shaped by estrogen (ie, it is curvy) is, in fact, a stereotype as it is an oversimplification of what a woman looks like. I don't get why you're going off on how they socially introduce themselves here since that is not what I was talking about in my statement which you quoted.

4335,"English has a lot of weird past tense forms. We also have several words that have two valid forms of a past tense, usually the irregular ending or the -d ending (like learnt versus learned, dreamt vs dreamed). Some of these words are able to be used interchangeably, whereas others are not because they aren't real words (sought vs seeked), like you wouldn't say ""I drived"" somewhere or ""I throwed"" something over drove or threw.

The one that I *hate* but which might have become valid through widespread misuse is proved. Proved is the proper past tense. But English has a passive voice (denoted by the presence of the word ""has"" or ""have"" paired with ""been"") and proved is regularly misapplied to that when it should be ""proven"". ""It has been proved"" makes me want to commit die. It's ""it has been proven"". Now when you have a past tense formed with ""has"" or ""have"", either work (""he has proved it"" versus ""he has proven it""), when it really should be ""proven"". It's analagous to ""drive"". ""It has been driven"" and ""he has driven""; you wouldn't say ""he has drived"".

The State Advocacy, on the other hand, was in favor of coming to collect the minutes . In this regard, the court has judged the procés and 1-O claims that the displacement of Junqueras to Brussels would an ""irreversible danger , "" the purpose of prosecution and loss of right of participation ""is not irreversible but temporary"" .
&gt;
&gt; The High Court indicates that the status of MEP is acquired in two phases: before the JEC and at the headquarters of the European Parliament, where it must state in writing about the incompatibilities and undertake the inauguration at the constitutive session on July 2.
&gt; 
&gt; The magistrates argue that authorizing the head of the Republicans to appear before the JEC ""would involve the implementation of a process that would culminate with"" the forced transfer of Junqueras to Brussels for the inauguration of that parliamentary body. ""
&gt;
&gt; That move Junqueras to Brussels would, according to the court, ""in an irreversible danger the ends of the process."" ""It would imply, from the outset, the loss of jurisdictional control over the precautionary measure that affects them and this from the moment the accused leaves the Spanish territory,"" the judges of the Second Chamber add.
&gt;
&gt; They also stress that Brussels ""is the place where one of the defendants in absentia claims to have installed the seat of the government of the Catalan republic in exile, in allusion to Carles Puigdemont, whose presidency he would incarnate.""

In another point of the letter the magistrates pose that ""the situation is now different"" to the one that occurred on May 21 when the court allowed Junqueras and four other prisoners to go to the Congress of Deputies and the Senate for Take possession of your seats.",,/r/europe/comments/c0j04w/elected_spanish_mep_is_denied_accreditation_by/er4wktp/,cilmor,1560511861

Exactly. That's why 500 years of Ottoman yoke didn't manage to destroy the economy and culture of Turkish-occupied countries as much as 45 years of Soviet-imposed communism did. And that's why despite this Turkish influence Yugoslavia was still the wealthiest country in Eastern Europe, so even if Turks damaged Serbian economy a little still it could've been easily improved within a short period of time.

4418,"-What's your point?

My point, and it is essential, is that the many problems Iran poses or that the western democracies have with Iran are of political, historical and/or geopolitical origins. And they may therefore be resolved politically, any particular issue has a potential middle-ground solution that doesn't require a blank check to the devil for western dems. Even their theocracy is parliamentary and democracy compatible to an extent. I am NOT saying its all nice and good in Iran I am saying it is potentially compatible with our values and has room towards a better , more democratic society. That it is INHERENT of the Chia Islam and the Irani culture.

On the other hand, Saudi Arabia is Feudal at its core and its partner theology is not in any stretch compatible with western dems values. The numerous Mosques that European countries had to close and the numerous Imams incarcerated or deported for preaching violence in and against Europe were all educated (at least partly) in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, directly or indirectly finances Islamic education and Mosques implementation in the whole world. And it is not soft, western-sanitized Islam. All that is NOT going to change, and I would even argue that the US chose the wrong vassal state in the region for economic reasons (oil) and not at all ""to make the world a better place"" or for ""values"" reasons. Remember that different Islam schools and tendencies were little known and overlooked at the time politics decided of collaborations that continue to this day.

-Mossadegh nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company without recompense and did not budge when sanctions were imposed. He was overthrown in a British-American coup, and the Shah was installed. It didn't work out in the long run, but it was **a typical geopolitical play**.

That's were your are being dishonest. You can't say fomenting a coup in a country essentially creating a monarchy, stomping peoples vote is **a typical geopolitical play** and say that Iran is out of his mind for seeking insurances for its long term survival... I mean Israel and Pakistan did get there insurances by getting nukes so to me that to is **a typical geopolitical play**... I would be very reluctant to start the whole nationalizing debate, but we both know that no compensation would have been enough for the anglo-saxons because it was a excuse to advance an anticommunist agenda. Period. I'll also mention one example of compensated nationalization. Haiti ""nationalized"" its population by declaring independence and ""[France, with warships at the ready, demanded Haiti compensate France for its loss of slaves and its slave colony.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_debt_of_Haiti#Independence_debt)"". That's right, compensation for freeing yourself from slavery.... They finished paying it up in FREAKIN 2014.

And now Iran, close to win the sympathy of Europe on this deal issue against the US (which is historically extremely important), that has everything to lose on a full-scale war and nothing to gain from it, that doesn't even closely win as much as the USA, Saudi Arabia, UAE or others from oil prices going up is attacking Norwegian Tankers?... I mean do you think they are actually run by mongoloids of some sort? [Here is a nice break down of the recent announcement of Pompeo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX1hk_8wTGk)

I am not buy this shit and neither should the EU, we have way to much to lose following the US. Here is the real reason this is happening. I don't have the article in English but here is the real deal [Le nouveau Grand Jeu](https://www.revueconflits.com/le-nouveau-grand-jeu-bonus/) (The New Big Game). The US took the Britannic geopolitical theory of [Halford Mackinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halford_Mackinder) laid out in his The Geographic Pivot of the History where he says ""Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island; Who rules the World Island commands the World."" Essentially saying that how rules the continent would rule over UK and the how would rule over the bigggest piece of land, Eurasia, would rule the world. This was taken up by [Spykman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_J._Spykman) and [Alfred Mahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan) and became the long lasting base for US foreign policy.

More recently Zbigniew Brzezinski Former National Security Advisor to Carter postulated: ""It is imperative that no competing Eurasian capable of dominating Eurasia could arise and contest the USA"". The background of long standing US foreign policy is dividing the world to stay on top and to a lesser extent fighting ideological competitions to a very specific version of capitalist democracy.

Define ""liberal western democracy"". For me it means as much as ""ultra-mega-zord"" from Power Rangers. A lot of inflated words next to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\[...\] **our political system and the guarantees of citizens laws are in danger.**  

Name some examples.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Like the separation of powers, which is not a mantra, but one of the guarantees, that people in power cannot abuse it, and can be held responsible for their actions.**  

It is a mantra. Just because some idiot wrote phrase ""separation of power"" into law, it does not mean anything. If the whole mechanism of judicial system oscillates around Parliament-made regulation, then in reality there is not separation. Again.  Mindless mantra. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**So that democracy does not devolve into autocracy or tyranny.** 

It already is. 51% of votes can do everything with reaming 49%.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;**Five, why not twenty? But OK. All decisions against Polish constitution.**

Then go for 20 please. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;**Sentences of Constitutional Tribunal were not immediately published. Against Art. 190. ust. 2.**

If Parliament must oblige CT, then why Parliament has the capacity to publish it? Why there is not CT-controlled Monitor Polski which publish it and it is legally binding for Parliament? Great example of shittiness of our constitution. PiS called bluff on it. They ignored it and said ""what will you do"" and you cannot do anyhing. Great system.

 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**President of State must accept Constitutional Tribunal judges appointed by Sejm, as President has any privilege in constitution to select or deny CT judges, Art. 194. ust. 1.**

Article 194 does not explicitly force President into singing anything. Another vague article that creates problem as soon as all institution are not in hands of one political entity.

Also, why the  hell President have to accept anything...? If Parliament accepted it, then why President have to sign it? They should be appointed already. Great example of dilution of responsibility, increasing bureaucracy and corruption. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**PiS has changed the law, so that Sejm appoints judges who are members of KRS, body responsible for overseeing the judiciary system in Poland, consisting of 6 members of parliament (elected by parliament) and of 15 judges (previously elected by judges, now by sejm) against Art. 173.**

Article 173 place is in trash. When judge X sentences person Y for two years in prison for crime Z, judge does it based on law passed by Parliament. If Parliament changes law so the crime Z is now be punished with death, judge must carry out those sentences regardless of judge's views.

There is no real independence from Parliament. This is mantra phrase that go against the actual mechanism. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**President of State appointed judge being president of CT ""in acting"", which is against Art. 194. ust. 2.**

Wrong article? 194.2. speaks about President of the State appointing president and vice-president of CT from the candidates presented by some other stupid organ. It does not say anything about ""in acting"" status being illegal.

Your phrasing is odd or soemthing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**PiS ""extinguished"" terms of KRS members before the constitutional 4 years, Art. 187. ust 3.**

It's not illegal to do it. In law illegal things are the things that are explicitly banned/forbidden. 187.3. regulates the time of term, but does not ban retiring KRS members. 

Another example of vagueness. You're well within your right to interpret it as ban, but it's not a fact.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**PiS also ""extinguished"" term of president of Highest Court (Sąd Najwyższy), Art. 183. ust. 6.**

Same here. It does not explicitly forbids retiring president of Supreme Court. Another shitty rule that can be interpreted in  many ways and most of them are still correct.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/c03nog/us_to_send_1000_troops_to_poland/er4qlxs/,Orku36,1560505149

With out trade no food for germany...so war is the only option.

*They saw the plantation as a means of controlling, anglicising and ""civilising"" Ulster*

It was presented as a joint British venture to James I but ultimately the English held more land than Scots (even if the Scots made up the greater number of actual settlers - this was more to do with geography and proximity to Scotland) - also the Ulster Scots are more visible planters because they celebrate their Scottish roots - the very fact there is an “Ulster-Scots” definition is testament to that",DNA% 54🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿19🇩🇪11🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿7🇳🇴6🇸🇮3🇫🇷,/r/europe/comments/c07g3c/papal_bull_oldest_public_document_in_ni_marks/er4mv5x/,Jiao_Dai,1560499165

Chromosomes or sex organs often don't matter when we're perceiving what gender someone is, so I think we can safely say that the label of 'man' or 'woman' doesn't necessarily have to be dependent on that. I mean, people have been crossing gender boundaries throughout history without access to medical transition!

Since Jaruzelski's trial when judge ordered hearing of I think 1000 witnesses, it is clear that politicians in Poland are never responsible for thier actions. This argument makes no sense. I mean I make sense to judge and kill half of the people who were in parliament since 1988, but it's not exclusively concern Kaczyński and his current allies.

**Point 2:** Is this illegal? He is not pointed in general election. PCT is political figure since CT exists.

**Point 3:** Again. This position is purely political and is appointed by politics. I don't see why are you hysterical about the current PCT, instead of getting mad about why no one changed the system since it was created.

**Point 4:** Polish judicial system, like all of the judicial systems around the world, is based on and (mainly) regulated by laws which are passed by politicians in parliament. This is not argument, this is some naive mantra you were forced to learn and now you're repeating it. Polish judicial system does not have solution like democratic votes for local judges, like in USA, so the ""separation of power"" is just empty mantra which you got baited into repeating.

It is pretty easy to just let gay people do their thing, it does not affect you in any way.  And likewise, for the most part just letting transgender people exist how they want to does not affect most people.  The problems started when people began redefining what it even means to be a man or a woman, and they required the whole of society to go along with their fringe ideas or else risk being labeled as a bigot.  This is how absurd phrases like ""a man delivered a baby"" or ""a feminine penis"" began to be used without the slightest bit of sarcasm.

""Has to know how to pull a trigger"" and ""knows how to fight"" are not nearly the same thing.

Training counts for a lot, and someone who has been through 8 weeks of Basic Training versus someone who has been extensively trained in the combat arms AND given subsequent regular exercise in the use of those arms... well, I think most people who have military experience can reliably predict that outcome.

D-Day, 1945: a significant number of the German Wehrmacht troops (who not only had extensive training but actual combat experience as well) had been stationed at the beach for 2 years while eating French bread &amp; cheese and drinking French wine and had gotten fat, soft, and lazy as a consequence.

They got rolled over by the Allies on D-Day.

German troops positioned on other beaches who had less experience and training, not so much - but they were more recent arrivals and were a much tougher opponent.

4822,"&gt;Italian as we know it today was not always spoken throughout Italy. The Italian language did not become the staple language until well into the end of the 19th Century during the process of Italian unification, or the Risorgimento. Until then, the Italian peninsula was made up of Italo-Romance dialects and smaller minority languages that were differentiated by region and historical influences. Once unification was complete, the Tuscan dialect was ushered into power as the official language of the Italian nation. This became the beginning of the modern end of the Greek language in Calabria, or what it is known today as Greko.

&gt;WHY SHOULD IT MATTER?

&gt;There exists today a tiny enclave of Greek-speaking people in the Aspromonte Mountain region of Reggio Calabria that seem to have survived millennia…perhaps since the Ancient Greeks began colonizing Southern Italy in the 8th and 7th Centuries BC. Their language is called Greko. They survived empires, invasions, ecclesial schisms, dictators, nationalistic-inspired assimilation, and much more. Greko is a variety of the Greek language that has been separated from the rest of the Hellenic world for many centuries. There are various population estimates circulating, but after I visited the region in April 2017 and sat down with several community leaders, the clearest estimate of remaining Greko speakers seems to be between 200-300 and numbers continue to decrease.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/c0fzjy/the_last_of_the_calabrian_greeks/er4d7e8/,filosoful,1560487612

4876,"&gt; Yes, I get what happens, and I'm saying those groups should be fixed BEFORE the election.

But parliamentary groups and political parties are completely separate entities, even if they share a name. And once an MEP is elected, they can join any group they want. If they change all of their political ideas and move to the other end of the spectrum, they're free to do so.

Parties are what you can vote for, and they already exist at a European level.

&gt; For example, the UK Labour Party should announce before the European elections which grouping they'll be a part of. That would normally be S&amp;D.

They sort of do announce it by being a member of the PES. The group in the EP is just called S&amp;D because only most of its members are also members of PES, but for example the Italian Democratic Party isn't.

&gt; S&amp;D's policies should be available online for you to see.

You mean like [this](https://www.pes.eu/en/manifesto2019/)?

&gt; S&amp;D should be on the ballot paper instead of Labour,

If you replace S&amp;D by PES, I agree. But only if the European Parliament is then elected by proportional representation of the whole EU rather than giving a fixed number of seats to each country. Otherwise it doesn't make sense.

But still today, a lot of advertising is for the European parties, at least here. CDU for example put the EPP logo on all their posters, and PES made some posters that didn't even have SPD on them, you were just supposed to know, and I think most people do.

&gt; and they should have to stay with that grouping for the duration of the parliament. Leaving that grouping should be akin to moving from Labour to Independent at the national level.

Aren't these statements contradictory? On the national level, once you're elected, you're elected, you have a free mandate. You can form parliamentary groups with other MPs from your own party or other parties as you wish. No party has any say over you, except when it comes to running for reelection. In the European Parliament it already works exactly the same way. And even if they were forced to stay within their group, what would that even mean? They would still be able to vote however the fuck they want. It would just be a pain in the ass for everybody involved, with absolutely no benefits. Which is why there is probably not a single parliament in the world that has such a stupid rule. The whole point about parliamentary groups is that they're completely voluntary.

&gt; If you asked most British voters what European political party Theresa May is in, for example, they'd have no clue. Heck, if you asked them to name three European political groupings there are, most wouldn't be able to.

OK. But that's the fault of British voters, British media, and British politicians. 

&gt; That's a failure in my book, and it stems from never even seeing the grouping you're potentially voting for on a ballot paper.

But you never see parliamentary groups on the ballot paper. In Germany for example, there is a parliamentary group that's called CDU/CSU. It consists of two parties: CSU, which only runs in Bavaria, and CDU, which runs in all states except Bavaria. They are two separate parties with separate party leaders, but they form a group together. You can't vote for CDU/CSU, you can only vote for CDU or CSU, depending on where you live. That's not so different from the EP groups, actually.

&gt; If the policies are decided after you've voted, then you're not voting for policies, you're voting for a familiar name on a ballot paper. It's bullsh\*t.

That's one thing you could call it, another would be ""representative democracy"". The whole point of it is that you don't get to vote on policies, you only get to decide which people you trust to vote on policies in your name.

It's a legitimate point that it's not ideal, but it certainly isn't restricted to the EP.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/c08avk/nationalists_fail_to_join_forces_in_european/er3zfd6/,muehsam,1560476974

5040,"Ok. First, the Spain comparison doesn't make much sense, because taking into account it happened more than 500 years ago, it would be like Turkey apologizing for attacking Vienna. Also, even with all the cruelties commited that I admit were deplorable, genocide is too strong of a word, because it implies intentionality. 90% of those deaths were caused by illnesses brought from the old continent  their inmune systems weren't prepared for. The only kind of erradication planned was a religious one, carried on mostly by forced conversion to christianity. Those enormous loses of life were never the intention, only a very regretable consequence.

Second, while there are a lot of Polish institutions and civilians that took part on the holocaust and they should admit to that, you must take into consideration that that only happened after their own country got invaded, and a good part of their institutions purged. It's not like they had much of a saying in the decision of participating on that.

I don't know why everyone keeps bringing up this issue with mothers not working. I've made it clear that I believe in a more equal distribution of paternal leave, similarly to how Sweden does it. I never said moms should stay at home with their kids' for 20 years. Ideally I'd extent the paternal leave to 24 months, with an even chunk for both parents, and the rest distributed according to their choice.

You mention that your wife took 12 months of paid leave and then say ""the expectation is that both parents will take some time off then get back to work"", which clearly isn't true in your case as your wife took on almost all of the parental leave available. I'm not going to criticize your family set-up, but it definitely runs contradictory to what you're saying. Again, I don't mean this as an attack; all the power to you and your family, I'm just pointing out what I see as an inconsistency.

Lastly, it's pretty clear that daycare institutions are struggling to keep up. That recent documentary really showed how overburdened they are. Minimumsnormeringer won't solve jack shit because there's not enough professional pedagogues available in the country, especially not if you further raise the educational standards for those employed.

5324,"&gt;He continued his assholery by campaigning for Trump while pretending to be neutral.

WTF

how is pointing out the issues with ""one side"" the equivalent of being part of ""the other side""? 

the leaks could've been the best thing to ever happen to the corrupt DNC, they could've used it as a justification to fire a lot of the ""establishment"" baggage, hired new friendly faces, and launched a ""new DNC"" campaign to convince people that they can do better.

instead they just doubled down and the majority of the USA collectively went ""no u!""..

i'm definitely not an expert on USA elections, but i've tried to stay very informed on the election during the campaign, and it was pretty clear to me that people were very enthusiastic about the sanders guy, meanwhile clinton was seen as the personification of the ""establishment"" which people on all sides hate. i had no idea that trump would actually manage to get into the finals, but i was very certain from the beginning that if anyone but sanders would be the DNCs nominee the GOP candidate would win.

i also have no idea what people are talking about when they say the polls lied, can't trust the polls, etc; because the polls that i was looking at clearly indicated that as sanders became more and more well known his numbers were surging, whilst clintons were falling constantly. the only reason why she had a big number at the start was because she was well known. people simply did not want to vote for her, the only thing she had going for her was that she wasn't trump, and that's just not enough to get elected.

so the DNC did exactly what the DNC was being accused, ie being corrupt, and pushed the establishment candidate instead of the frontrunner that was well liked by the people.

i remember a rather early mid time opinion poll saying that if it came down to any democratic candidate vs trump, trump would win; any apart from sanders, the reason being that a lot of republicans who were anti establishment could see themselves voting for sanders. i wish i could find that poll again because i think it perfectly summarizes the whole election.",Austria (Federate Immediately!),/r/europe/comments/c05cuv/sajid_javid_signs_us_extradition_order_for_julian/er2q53h/,sciwa,1560447932

5360,"&gt; Thing is, those do not exist in a free market. This is something where consumers get Hobson's choice. And that needs to be treatet differently. And in some cases, it should absolutely be considered the state's responsibility to provide that.

That's an entirely different argument — albeit one with some merit — from the proposition that, having privatised such public goods, that equity in those public goods can be expropriated other than by market means **if** any sort of market economy is at all meaningful.

The reason is simple: you cannot confiscate or compromise other people's property interests other than by established, lawful means that any other private actor can use — or property means nothing if the government decides it wants it.  *That's* why right-wingers hate socialism so much.

&gt; The act of privatizing things(aka selling off state assets) is a one-time cash influx. In the long run, things don't necessarily need to improve for consumers. In many cases, they got worse.

I agree.  Mostly it was daft.  If you're at all familiar with UK infrastructure, it was *especially* daft when (or rather how) it was done to rail.  British Rail might never have been particularly brilliant but it was never, at its worst, as bad as the shitshow and cost that modern rail costs (especially when travelling long distance).

&gt; The buyers of the flats tried to increase the value of their assets. And subsequently priced people out.

Exactly the same thing has happened here.

&gt; It is not unheard of that people have to spend over half of their income after taxes on rent.

That is *routine* in the UK.  Someone on the median income of £28,500 (and, by definition, half of all earners are on much less which doesn't include all those out of work who subsist on what pittance they can get from the government) takes home about £1900 pcm after tax and assuming no student loan or pension contributions etc.

Finding a 1 bed flat within 2 hours' commuting distance of London will cost you around £700 pcm before utilities, insurance etc.  That's average; in reality, you are likely to pay much more at any given time depending on your needs and what's available at the time.  A two bed property is around £900.  And that's away from centres of work.  Closer to areas of employment, those figures are more like £900 and £1400.  If you're single with minimal needs, you can get by on less than half your take home pay if you ear median wage.

A [1-bed house in London will cost more than you earn](https://www.home.co.uk/for_rent/london/current_rents?location=london) on the median wage, which means you are stuck renting a room that costs about half your take-home pay.

A whole lot of variables in that; suffice to say that families end up spending at least half their take-home pay or substantially more.  This is part of why brexit inspired so much traction: it has little to do with the EU as such, but the fact that the housing market is in such a state was enough to make a lot of pissed off people give the establishment a good kicking.  Brexit offered just that opportunity.

&gt; And the smaller the flat, the bigger the price per square meter. thing is, you have to live somewhere. So people overpay on rent and don't manage to save up. this is one factor why people live from paycheck to paycheck.

Yep.

Right.

&gt; Selling of these flats was bad in the long-term. And even more expensive since now the communities need to up the rent allowance. Or buy back at inflated prices. All of that was foreseeable.

Yep.

&gt; Re: The Chesterton quote. He didn't foresee that conservatism could try to turn back the clock. Or be this stubborn. Conservatism which doesn't recognize that situations have changed is regressive, really.

I wouldn't describe the current Tory government as being particularly conservative.  I don't know what it is, but it's not classically conservative.  But then, the previous Labour government wasn't classically Labour or left.  It has returned to its roots, but is not doing well electorally (nor are the Tories, thanks to brexit).

&gt; tl;dr: There are different market forms and conservatives in the past acted as if there was only one and that it was totally free.

That's true, but also evidently not unique to any one locality.  It's reflective of the fact that the neoliberalism and ordoliberalism that pervades most developed economies is broken.  Especially on health, housing and education.

5418,"&gt; I don't see the membership backing Johnson because he's too divisive and backstabby.

A lot depends on who the other one is.  Boris has character and is well-known enough, even if for the wrong reasons, to have substantial mindshare.  He also didn't do too badly as Mayor of London.

But as far as the contest goes, it will mostly be decided on two things: who is most likely to deliver brexit (regardless of the consequences of how it is delivered) and who is most likely to beat Corbyn at the next GE.  Which might be sooner than 2022.

Crucially, all this depends on how the Tory Parliamentary party perceives the candidates.  They will eliminate all but one of those who fail those criteria, and then it's down to Tory members who, again, will vote on perceptions that bear scant relationship to reality or sane electoral strategy.

&gt; Polls simply just look good because there's effectively no one running against him until the #2 candidate is found in the next few rounds. I'll be unhappy to be proven wrong though.

The internal (Parliamentary) electoral arithmetic makes it virtually a certainty that Boris will be one of the final two.  For that not to be the case he'd either have to voluntarily withdraw or see vast numbers of MPs defect to other candidates.  Which is not impossible, given his big mouth.  He's been uncharacteristically quiet of late, probably hoping to minimise the opportunity of saying something that would have exactly that effect.

Just watch him after he makes into the final two, though.  He'll be out all horns blaring in order to pander to the Tory membership vote.  But he won't get mine†.

5457,"&gt; Thing is, conservatism now seems to be interpreted as contrarianism.

The whole of UK politics seems to have devolved to contrarianism.

Rory Stewart is my kind of Tory.  He embodies conservative principles (as I conceive of them) as well as any one individual politician can.  He is who I want to see shape the party, but there is too much discord and too many competing interests for any sanity any time in the foreseeable future.

&gt; Scientist say, climate change is man-made and we need to do something. Conservative tendency seems to be to deny that. If they were honest, they'd say they don't think it were worth the money.

I don't know which would be worse.  That it's not real, or that it's real but not worth addressing.

&gt; Socio-economists say that austerity harms the economy. Conservatives say that it doesn't. to be fair, here seems to be a generational divide between socio-economists.

I generally take Mark Blyth's view on austerity (it doesn't work).  Conservatives wouldn't generally say that it doesn't hurt people, but rather that excessive deficit spending *also* hurts people without actually helping them that much — and that the economy has to be left to rebalance itself rather than be subject to central planning.

That said, austerity is only one solution to fiscal deficits.  Tories aren't generally brave enough to say, ""yeah, you know what?  You have to pay more tax.""  Which is why I'm pissed at the likes of Boris who wants to raise the higher rate (40%) to £80k.  I'm currently in the higher rate bracket but wouldn't be if Boris had his way.  But the difference in take-home money it would make isn't worth the cost to the country (IMV).

&gt; People say that traditions change. Conservatism says it shouldn't. Despite a couple of thousands of years worth of proof of the opposite.

It's not quite that simple.  G K Chesterton put it best in 1924:

&gt;&gt;&gt; The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types -- the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution.

Which rather goes to show that little has changed in a century.

&gt; Socio-economists point out that a staggeringly low number of elites own a staggeringly high amount of the wealth and that weren't good. Conservatives still cling onto the belief that elites need to be supported so they can lift everybody else up. Even if that hasn't happened these 20 years.

Both miss the point that paper asset wealth and income aren't the same things.  A lot of people have a lot of wealth on paper, but that has very little to do with the functioning of the economy.  The financial economy has royally screwed our productive economy, but so it is in every developed economy (including most of Europe).

&gt; IDK, man, conservatism has been proven wrong these couple of decades and the conservative approach seems to be to deny the findings.

You can say the same of liberalism and socialism.  None of them have the whole of the solution.  All of them have problems and all of them deny that they do.

&gt; Tories in the UK deny that the introduction of UC had been shambolic. Tories in the UK deny a report on poverty by the UN.

Because that would involve admitting that incumbent Tory policy was misguided.  That could theoretically change under a new PM, but it probably won't because nothing happens in Whitehall or Westminster that isn't brexit.  And even then, nothing useful happens.

&gt; And now the new stance seems to be ""fuck business"".

Tbf, only one Tory said that — one who is notoriously labile, at that.

&gt; And that does make one the top Tory in the country?

No.  The fact that he made such an idiotic comment is not why he's leading the pack.  The two are broadly coincidental and, insofar as they share a common cause, that common cause is quite distant.

&gt; I can't imagine how Maggie Thatcher would have reacted to that. Well, I can. And she would have made it physical by means of handbag.

I can't imagine how Thatcher would have reacted to anything in modern politics, much less the EU since Lisbon.  The veto was the only thing that let her get anything done in the EEC.

5469,"&gt;Evolution vs ""God made us as we are""

There is no conflict with the Biblical account and the process of natural selection. It is entirely possible that just as gravity moves rivers by God's design that natural selection moves the changes of species by God's design. If Genesis 2 is accurate is no more a contradiction of science than a man-made river is. God created Adam and Eve but the text never says they were the first humans. 

&gt;Big bang theory vs Genesis

No contradiction I know of, maybe you could explain. 

&gt;""Noah's ark"" is just impossible, with its size, how it took ""examples of all species"" etc.

This one I generally concede cannot exist with our current understanding. What I consider the likely explanation is that three thousand years ago ""the whole world"" did not mean ""the entire planet"" as such a concept did not exist. I have no theological problem with the flood on describing a catostrophic local flood like the creation of the Mediterranean or Black Sea. That is hardly important. 

&gt;Much of the ""miracles""

There is no contradiction between miracles and science (why did you put the word miracles in quotes?). The natural world operates according to certainly rules which science observes, predicts and often seeks to exploit. A miracle is God intervening in the world. This is no more a conflict with science than a human intervening in the world.",,/r/europe/comments/bzefy1/christianity_as_default_is_gone_the_rise_of_a/er1j2u3/,ezk3626,1560432538

5535,"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2019/05/20/2018-Review-of-Program-Design-and-Conditionality-46910

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has admitted “notable failures” in the first Greek bailout including a deeper-than-expected recession, a run on the country’s banking system and exceptionally high unemployment.

The IMF’s Review of Program Design and Conditionality provides a deep look into the design of 133 IMF-supported lending programs in operation between September 2011 and December 2017.

The IMF research paper said the multi-billion rescue package for Greece failed to restore market confidence, that the fiscal adjustment proramme had notable failures, wrong projections and overlook. It also admitted that delays in debt restructuring saved the foreign banks but it was of little help for Greece. The PSI of March 2012 did not help either.

The review also identified several factors that potentially inhibited programs from fully reaching their objectives. Overoptimistic economic forecasts reduced a program’s chances of success; accordingly, the review recommends using a more conservative approach to economic forecasts and providing deeper analyses of the impact that policies under the program could have on economic growth. More extensive contingency planning should also be included when designing programs.

Public debt is a case in point. Debt sustainability improved in most cases where debt vulnerabilities started out high. In some programs, however, debt exceeded the Fund’s initial projection by considerable margins. Fund policies are already in place to deal with unsustainable debt in Fund-supported programs. While any debt restructuring needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis, more careful diagnosis is essential—this means sharper tools for the IMF’s debt sustainability analysis are needed to reduce any bias in judgement when assessing debt.

The review finds many programs applied fiscal adjustments that were less growth-friendly than initially envisaged. Fiscal adjustment tended to be achieved by cutting public investment, possibly curtailing future growth, rather than by lowering current spending or raising revenue. To be a more useful guide for the government’s fiscal policy, an IMF program could set more granular targets, like a floor for critical public investments.

he IMF said the 2010 Greek programme gave the euro area time to build a ‘firewall’ around other vulnerable members, but said not tackling the country’s public debt problem decisively at the start created uncertainty about the bloc’s ability to resolve the crisis.

The IMF pledged about €30bn to Greece at the time, out of a total package of €110bn.

“Market confidence was not restored, the banking system lost 30pc of its deposits, and the economy encountered a much deeper-than-expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment,” the IMF report said.

The IMF report said that it lowered its standards and approved an exceptionally large loan to Greece in May 2010 despite having considerable misgivings about the country’s debt sustainability, although it said fiscal adjustment was unavoidable.

The bailout avoided a disorderly default and limited contagion across the eurozone, it said, but accepted that the recession has been deep with exceptionally high unemployment.

The Washington-based organisation also said it may have been overly constrained by working with European leaders in a monetary union, and not focused enough on ensuring political support existed within Greece for the rapid economic adjustments called for under the bailout.

“The programme did not restore growth and regain market access as it had set out to do,” the report said.

But the European Commission rejected the criticisms in the IMF report about the need for upfront debt restructuring.

“The (IMF) report argues that an upfront debt restructuring in 2010 would have been desirable. We fundamentally disagree,” a spokesman for the commission said, according to irish independent.",,/r/europe/comments/c03ys8/varoufakis_explains_the_eurozone_crisis_munich/er1kppf/,ILoveBurnedPotatoes,1560433138

&gt;I don't know of any terrorists there.

You said you've been involved in Donbass. Was it with the terrorists or with Ukrainians?

&gt;But if their decisions directly affect people who did not have a say in it, how is that democratic?

I actually didn't claim it was democratic because it cannot be if it's decided by another state.

Point is that international law (including UN SC) is the common will of all states, not just of democratic ones. That's why some crimes are never countered as the intervention is vetoed by two undemocratic countries in the UN SC. But some intervention is still needed for humanitarian purposes, which the democratic countries are more legitimate than dictatorships to make.

&gt;If me and my three friends vote on robbing your family, is that a democratic decision?

There's the difference - a democratic society is less likely to vote for a criminal deed against another subject.

It's first past the post voting per state.
The primaries are a patch to that, as candidates can pretend they favour the parties' principles while having a viewpoint that's far more aligned to parties outside the two dominant ones.

First past the post voting however skews the results completely and is the reason why there are only two parties that matter in the US.
On top of that, since the voting system is run on a state level it means that your vote won't make a difference to whether or not one of the parties wins or loses, as only the swing states make the difference.

5676,"&gt; Ever look at the rate of complications in modern medicine? ;) Hint, its catatrosphically high. How about the decades-long bias faovring white men, or the rampant fraud in clinical trials?

Which still do not change the fact that medicine saves millions of lives every year. When people get sick, they no longer go praying, they'll go to the doctor. They do it because they know they likely have some pathogen, a knowledge given by science, and they know professionals will be able to help with that, again who are guided by science.

On the other hand, people might pray to get well, but... most of them know it doesn't do anything. I imagine all of Europe was praying during the Black Death and yet half of them were wiped out.

&gt;What would you call shock and awe where they dropped tens of thousands of incendiary bombs on a civilian city? Or the countless industrial poisonings around the world for purposes of manufacturing items they know they can't handle the byproducts of?

As I already wrote, science is also used for wrong reasons. It's unavoidable that such broad-based development means also development of weapons, crime tools, reduction of privacy etc.

&gt;You may have not looked; the event that provides disproof may be rare; 

Which is why science is always open to criticisim. If you don't agree with a theory, a claim, you can counter it. This has also, repeatedly, changed general positions in science, as portrayed in the sketch video.

&gt;whereas, i might take a look. and find a rare ephemeral atmospheric activity known as ""ball lightning"" ;)  
&gt;  
&gt;cough. see the value of looking for disproof?

In that case, they would very likely see rain, thunder and a single ball flashing quickly somewhere. Very different from raining fireballs. And if I can take a look, of course I will. If I can't (as in case of religion), I require proof.

&gt;then the science of yesterday, must be less reliable than the science of today; and yet the science of today, is built on the premises of the science of yesterday -- and in turn will contribute to the science of tomorrow... conclusion: science is not omnipotent; it errs, and to a far greater degree than eternal truth ;) 

That's merely because humans are imperfect, our access to evidence is imperfect, which both add up to an imperfect science. But still the best we can. 

On the other hand, the ""eternal truth"" is just a claim, without anything to back it up, but with tons of evidence pointing to its fictionality. 

&gt;like the world is flat; that indigenous people are subhuman?

The world was proven to be round by science. Indigenous people being subhumans is an ideological judgement, while some may use scientifical methods to ""prove"" that, it doesn't make it a result of science.

&gt; The clock, is broken. BUT IT DOES, correctly tell the time twice a day ;) 

So why would I prefer the broken clock to a functional one? Because the seller of the broken clock tells it fulfills all of my wishes, while the seller of the working one only says the clock is as accurate as he could make it?

&gt; the language of the Bible is broad enough to accommodate many possible interpretations 

Of course it is. Just like horoscope, message in fortune cookies and other similar stuff.

&gt;you already have. science is a religion. so too is worship of the dollar (no different than a golden calf) ;)

Well, we are getting into semantics because religion is difficult to define. But still I'd disagree, science is basically organizing human knowledge. It evolves all the time and is based on provable facts.

Worship of dollar, what do you mean? Trusting your wealth to be hold in the currency? Trusting it as a mean of transaction? Well, that's more about trusting a currency and not really surprising to trust the one that's been in usage for quite a long and has been stable all the way through. Even more so if you happen to be an American, you know it more than any else, you have easy access to it. I use the euro, for example, in every transaction.

&gt;I am far more concerned that you to learn the difference between following a system through - and the invalidity of claiming that knowledge, from a superficial glance at some words on a page ;) 

But you are unable to offer me anything else to look at / study / criticise than those superficial words on a page. Isn't the Bible supposed to be the word of God, the guidance for a Christian's life and the source of knowledge?

&gt;Just curious. :) I thought perhaps, this might be some cultural-linked trait.

What exactly? That I'm irreligious and trust in science? Well, statistically, I am more likely to be like that here as Christianity plays a much weaker role in Estonia than in most of Europe.

&gt;Suppose that must be by ""belief"" aka ""a leap of faith"" must be requisite in most of the religions. ;)

Sure, but if that leap of faith includes leaping out of the scientific world, in fact, against the knowledge given by science, it becomes worrisome.

&gt;I find this as silly as injecting science, into a religious text. Both fundamental flaws in reasoning.

Why? Religion does not exist in isolation, it has affected and continues to affect our lives to a large extent. It's not just some introspective mental yoga. When somebody claims e.g. that humans were created as they are by the God, it directly conflicts evolution. Of course science will debunk it. In fact, that's kinda what has been happening in the West, religious positions are forced to withdraw if they conflict with science. That's because most people know only one of them tells the truth (or at least is closer to the truth).",Eesti,/r/europe/comments/bzefy1/christianity_as_default_is_gone_the_rise_of_a/er0kdnv/,toreon,1560418219

This is why Assange's lawyer herself said that the signing of the order was a normal part of the process and the extradition challenge now begins.

It's more of a trust thing really. The referendum returned a leave vote, despite the government campaigning remain and then after Cameron's resignation, Theresa May became PM and was a remainer put in place to deliver Brexit. This alone raised a lot of questions in some leave circles about whether the government was acting in good faith.

The way they see it is if the UK has another referendum and it returns a remain result then it's legitimacy is to be questioned on the basis this is what the government always wanted. They see the whole process at this point as a cynical attempt to pretend to try for Brexit, while doing everything possible to undermine and overturn the result to ""get what they always wanted.""

It isn't necessarily that they don't think people are allowed to change their minds, or that voting twice on something diminishes the democratic legitimacy, it's more that they don't trust the Government to have not done everything possible to undermine the democratic legitimacy themselves in order to deliver the preferred result.

The EU knows that this deal will never pass in parliament, not least because parties like the SNP and Lib Dems who are allegedly terrified of a no-deal exit hypocritically refuse to countenance *any* deal in order to continue to frustrate the Brexit process. This deal is the best result remainers could realistically achieve but insidiously they will be only be satisified if Brexit and democracy along with it entirely abandoned.

This is purposeful brinkmanship from the EU and its UK-based advocates, from people with little respect for democracy and in the EU's case from people who have already aided the overturning of democratic referendum results on previous occasions.

As the EU election results have shown however, the British people will not just accept this crime against democracy. Parliament, now brimming with two-timing, by-election-shunning defectors and MPs who have rescinded on their manifesto pledges to respect the outcome of the EU referendum, is no longer fit for purpose and is living on borrowed time. 

We're at a stage now where even if the EU magically dropped the requirement for the Irish backstop, our remainer/loser-filled parliament would *still*  refuse to pass the deal.

5829,"Hey,
Glad you liked it.

Actually The Balkan wars is very different than these described above. Balkan wars are Serbia + Greece + Bulgaria fighting the Ottoman empire in 1913 and then Serbia and Greece fighting Bulgaria and then when Bulgaria seemed to beat them both, comes Romania from north to attack Bulgaria. 

The liberation war happens in 1878, after that Bulgaria unifies with Southern Romalia ( which is a part of Bulgaria that stayed in Ottoman Empire ) and Serbia is attacking Bulgaria because of that, which is an epic war in which the whole Bulgarian army is ready to fight Ottomans and it's located south east, and we're attacked from West ... We still won this battle, actually Austro-Hungary is stopping us from conquering the whole country of Serbia.

After that the Independence in 1912, The Balkan wars, WW1, WW2, Communism.

We had the luck to stay away from Yugoslav's wars for good. Even though we have close connection with other slavic nation on the peninsula, we didn't take a side in these wars.

Nowadays we've overcome our ambitions to unify with Macedonia ( which back then was populated with only bulgarians ), northern Dobrogea, southern Tracia and western ""suburbs"" ( couldn't find better translations, but it's a territory populated with bulgarians, taken from Serbia after the Balkan wars ). As you may know, we're #1 shrinking nation in the world, mostly duo to the fact of mass emigration. But more and more young people are starting to return to work here, many are going abroad to study and then return back here to work.

Salaries are not like europeans, but our standards aren't as well. With the average salary in Sofia you could live better than in western europe with average salary ( from my point of view ). 

More and more people ( of course, youngsters ) are trying to improve themselves, to do better and to live better. Because the communism thought people that everybody is the same and if you do better, doesn't matter because your job and your life are predefined from your birth. Now, when you can travel and learn and communicate with others, people realise that everything is up to you. But still finding good working employees here is very hard, because of the high levels of brain drain.

Of course this is from the point of view from a very optimistic person living in the biggest city with good salary. We're on top of most pessimistic countries out there, so in other towns people might not thing the same. I've seen many people saying that nothing could be done here and the only way is to leave the country and go abroad. But I've talked to many bulgarians abroad and they're saying that abroad is no better than here and that they miss their friends and families. 

The biggest problem is actually corruption. We're #1 in EU for corruption and it seems it won't change anytime soon. And this is holding us back the most. Because foreigners won't do business here, locals are unable to do any meaningful business as well. Even though we have 10% corporate tax, this doesn't matter much. 

tl;dr; - Things are changing with new generations ( born after 1989 ), but we still have a lot to do. And with the highest levels of corruption in EU it's a bit harder to happen.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/bzo9na/nearly_90_percent_of_serbias_citizens_against/er07w3x/,SveXteZ,1560412276

However the Soviets at the same time did not have a real will to help the uprising as they showed by supporting the allied air-support bridge not letting any allied airplanes land on Soviet occupied territory and the token arms they did send didn't have any parachute and were thus unusable upon landing. Stalin just wanted an example of support (albeit how inefficient it was) to be able to claim that he had kept his promise to Mikolajczyk.

The Soviets only wanted a puppet installed and therefor the independent Polish uprising were not preferred. So while it's true that their front were stretched too thin to help, the will wasn't there either.

5901,"It comes from the fact that Russia ""liberated"" us from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. 

The truth is that during this period of time Russia fought many battles with Ottomans and this was just one of the battles, but it fought on our territory. And  bulgarians organized themselves to help russians and liberate the country at the same time. I'm not saying they didn't help, but I'm saying it's not the ""liberation"" war that is promoted in our school books that are written during the communist era.

Actually after that we fought with Russia a few times. The first direct conflict were in southern Dobrogea where Russia and Romania attacked us in the WW1. 

But after 1945 when the Communists came, the history is rewritten and these battles are forgotten ... and the battle of 1878 is called ""Russian - Ottoman liberation war"". 

And because of this history mismatch in our books + the propaganda from ""The party"" - there are many people thinking that Russia is actually helping us, which is not true. We have currently very strong presence of communist party ( second biggest party in the parliament, with just a few % less votes than the main one ) and there are strong russian culture presence in the country ( like many russian stores, that I bet work at a loss ).

5904,"&gt;But how? It, like burden-sharing in general, is a measure to relieve entry points of pressure.

As you said yourself, it takes a long time to fully vet them and provide legal status, so what happens in the mean time? Either you have to keep them locked up for all that time or else they will simply disappear and leave for Germany the first chance they get. So essentially we would be keeping a large group, against their will, stuck in one place for a long time. How do you think that will end?  

&gt;Ah, I think I understand what you mean now. In essence, you fear that NS2 would implement a bypass that would allow Russia to cut off countries which it currently would not.

Precisely. 

&gt; I can see the dilemma. From what I recall reading, Russia has been a rather reliable supplier even in times of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union would export gas to West Germany and France. Then again, I actually consider the Soviet Union to have been more predictable than Putin's Russia is right now  

Thats true, but I would say thats due to their economics, cutting off their largest importers would have been (and still would be) very bad for them, its not due to their good will or respect of contracts.

5922,"1. Yeah, that's still double speak. ""I'm not saying atheists are bad. I'm just saying they have no reason to be good and often do bad things."" That's so nice of you to attribute that to us in such a broad generalization.

2. You don't know god exists. You assume he does. You do not have the knowledge that God is real, you only have faith.

3. There were no atheist states when slavery existed. So they couldn't have abolished it. That's a flawed premise. Atheist states are far too modern in that context.

Why would morality absent of a god be any less arbitrary than the myriad of ways god is interpreted? Muslims and Jews worship the same god, yet claim Christianity is not the correct interpretation. Even within these three religions there's a great disparity between different sects.   That's not even counting the fact, that to an atheist, they're all arbitrary moral systems based on pure fantasy.",,/r/europe/comments/bzefy1/christianity_as_default_is_gone_the_rise_of_a/eqzuxp8/,Oceans_Apart_,1560406337

There is no easy answer as to what makes it different because there's no simple objective definition (and the legislation supposes case by case treatments to establish the violent character of a content) but if you don't see the difference between an image of a motionless kid from afar where you need a caption to inform you he's not just sleeping in the sand, and a bloody stump of a neck from up close with a head hanging by a shred of flesh you might have been desensitized to violence a tad.
