81,"I would also say fear is a primary motivator. 

The islands issue for example the more logical and lets say educated people I met such as retired military officers etc. tell me that if all Islands and 12 miles zone is granted to Greece that Greeks would and will blockade and trap all Turkish vessels from fishing boats to military cruisers in their Turkish ports. Or that if we leave Cyprus to its fate and evacuate our troops the next morning more pictures of Turkish babies butchered in their bathtubs would appear.

''We would have to ask for permission or even get fired upon if we tried to go on a mission in Somalia or patrol our own shores.''

That view is very widespread and assumes many things:

* That a Greece especially one that was negotiated with amicably about the most pressing issue between us would be totally fine with firing on or blocking our vessels at peacetime.
* That Greece will never drop their antagonistic/defensive stance against Turkey no matter what concessions Turkey gives.
* That the only thing preventing a wholesale slaughter of anyone with Turkish heritage in Cyprus is the 10k or so Turkish troops there.
* That the Western world would be fine with any of the above.

None of these fears are true imho. I mean Cyprus both North and South are well integrated into the Western World with many seeking education and residence in the UK for instance where cultures and influences are mixed in a great harmony despite the border.

I think the romantic ideals are a cover for the deep rooted fears, the fear of Sevres and being partitioned and becoming victims. Must appear strong, must resist, trust no one etc.

I do not fully agree with some of the positions of Greece and the EU when it comes to these issues but realpolitik dictates we must listen to them and sit down and talk about them rather than sabre rattle and posture indefinitely. Contact between Turkey and Cyprus would also do wonders for this, opening ports border posts etc. same with Armenia; dialogue and access/recognition should not be ''rewards'' or goals of cooperation but the very first step.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/g8udsb/turkey_upset_cause_eu_backs_eu_members_greece/foq8ww1/,peacefullpanda,1587987053

125," In 2019, the European Union of 27 Member States (EU) granted protection status to 295 800 asylum seekers. Compared to 2018 (316 200), total number of persons granted protection status was down by 6%. In addition, the EU received 21 200 resettled refugees in 2019. This information is issued by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. 

The total number of asylum seekers granted protection in the EU in 2019 comprised of 141 100 grants of refugee status (48% of all positive decisions), 82 100 grants of subsidiary protection (28%) and 72 700 grants of humanitarian protection (25%). 

The largest group of beneficiaries of protection status in the EU in 2019 remained Syrians (78 600 or 27% of the total number of persons granted protection status in the EU), followed by Afghans (40 000 or 14%) and Venezuelans (37 500 or 13%). The number of Venezuelans rose by nearly 40 times in 2019 compared with 2018, when almost 1 000 Venezuelans were granted protection status in the EU. 

Among the Syrians granted protection status in the EU, 71% were recorded in Germany (56 100). For the Afghans the highest share 41% was also recorded in Germany (16 200). Nearly all grants of protection status to Venezuelans were recorded in Spain (35 300), 94% of EU total.

 The Antifaschistische Aktion was formed largely as a counter-move to the social democrats' establishment of the Iron Front in 1931, which the KPD regarded as a ""social fascist terror organisation"".[4] The Antifaschistische Aktion was an integral part of the KPD and was mainly active as a KPD campaign during the elections in 1932. During its brief existence the Antifaschistische Aktion focused in large part on attacking the social democrats, as they were seen by the KPD as the most dangerous and capable fascists; the KPD viewed the Nazi Party as a less sophisticated fascist party and as the lesser evil compared to the SPD, **and sometimes cooperated with them in attacking the social democrats.**",Romania,/r/europe/comments/g8fcmj/on_this_day_26_april_1937_the_ancient_basque_city/fopuq4b/,AndreiLazarescu,1587972769

294,"** Three weeks ago, a man with a Russian diplomatic passport and a suitcase containing poison landed at Prague airport, according to the Czech weekly Respekt, citing his sources. The Czech services treated this as a threat to two Prague politicians, who had recently confronted Moscow.**

According to the sources of Respekt, the man with the poison was to be a member of the Russian secret service. He was picked up from the airport by a car of the Russian embassy in Prague.

The politicians under protection are the mayor of all Prague Zdenek Hrib and the district chief of Prague 6 Ondrej Kolar. Both of them have been confronting the Kremlin authorities in recent months.

Hrib decided to name one of the capital's squares after Boris Nemtsov, a Russian oppositionist murdered in 2015. What is particularly telling is that this is the square where the Russian embassy stands. The diplomatic post has decided to keep using its old address.

**The marshal was dismantled**

Kolar, the second of the protected politicians, decided to remove from his district the monument of Marshal Ivan Konev, the Soviet commander from World War II, whose troops liberated Prague from German occupation. His monument has stood in the Czech capital since 1980. On 3 April Kolar moved it from a public place to a warehouse in connection with the protests of those who pointed out that Konev was responsible for the deportation to the Soviet Union of Russians persecuted by Stalin, who found refuge in the Czech Republic.

Konev also took part in the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising and the erection of the Berlin Wall. As the councillors of the Czech capital stressed, Konev also participated in the preparation of the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

The removal of the monument caused a crisis in Czech-Russian relations. The Russian Prosecutor's Office initiated criminal proceedings for the removal of the Konev monument from Prague. The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided that the implementation of proceedings against the Czech local government of the territorial unit where the statue of the Soviet Marshal was located is unacceptable. Czech diplomacy decided that Russian regulations do not have the power to act in another country.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/g8w9wl/two_czech_politicians_protected_out_of_fear_of/fopvvt5/,Duchowicz,1587973877

Bombing Guernica was a way to install fascism in power in Spain, and a way for Germany and Italy to practice bombing techniques they'd use later all over Europe.

The UK and US bombed Germany specifically to stop their world conquest and to save the lives of their own soldiers who would have otherwise had to face Germany at its full might without bombing of large cities.  Its also important to note that many Germany cities, like Berlin, were not heavily damaged by bombing but nevertheless were almost entirely destroyed when the battle lines reached them.  It would be impossible to wage war against Germany without mass civilian deaths.

Countries that have a presidential system, like France, can usually vote on multiple candidates.


I agree that in most countries the public doesn’t directly vote ministers into office, but most of the time it’s a representation of the “winning” parties.

Never, but imagine using this, for example in court. Legit good luck to person who identifies as male with vagina in prison. In polish ID you have /sex/ not gender, and afaik you have to get surgery to change that. 

Changing documents should be restricted for special cases, its not like ""today i feel like my name is XYZ, tomorrow my name is ABC, gimme new ID"".
 If doctors say that you require new identity, go ahead, get surgery, get new ID, enjoy that. Sorry but (In Poland) we follow ICD-10, not APA, and trans people still fall under F64, so technically they are /sick/ and treatment require sex reassignment therapy.


&gt;The gender marker on an identity card has no reason to identify your biological sex.

The gender marker on an identity card has no reason to care about your feelings. Its identity card not ""how i feel card"". Even more, law shouldn't care about your feelings.

It's actually a marvelous thing, but a shame that some people still insist that there's ""two stories"" to tell as though there needed to be an effort to take down the allies a notch, can't have them patting themselves on the back for stopping the holocaust. A fair representation is that the axis was barbaric and the worst regime to ever grace the stage of modern world history and the allies weren't just ice cream and sunshine.

789,"Yes, as you just said, Bolsonaro is a neoliberal. 'Neoliberalism' doesn't care whether someone is a conservative, a literal fascist dictator, or a centrist, as long as they implement the 'correct' economic policies. Pinochet, Bolsonaro's idol, was the first neoliberal, and his chief economist is a noted supporter of Pinochet who migrated to Chile to enjoy the dictatorship.

[Here you can read a book (if you ever do that)](https://www.ijf.cjf.gob.mx/cursosesp/2016/SeminarioEJLatinoamericanos/mat/seleme/4ABriefHistoryNeoliberalism.pdfSignature=ab301f96ba5f7aa9c1c0782bc1ea264e474fb8e6861fd7a7e42a790f90954ed1) where you can learn all about this.

&gt; The first experiment with neoliberal state formation, it is worth
recalling, occurred in Chile after Pinochet’s coup on the ‘little
September 11th’ of 1973

&gt; A group of economists known as ‘the Chicago boys’ because of
their attachment to the neoliberal theories of Milton Friedman,
then teaching at the University of Chicago, was summoned to help
reconstruct the Chilean economy. The story of how they were
chosen is an interesting one. The US had funded training of Chilean economists at the University of Chicago since the 1950s as part
of a Cold War programme to counteract left-wing tendencies in
Latin America. Chicago-trained economists came to dominate at
the private Catholic University in Santiago. During the early
1970s, business elites organized their opposition to Allende
through a group called ‘the Monday Club’ and developed a working relationship with these economists, funding their work
through research institutes. After General Gustavo Leigh, Pinochet’s rival for power and a Keynesian, was sidelined in 1975, Pinochet brought these economists into the government, where their
first job was to negotiate loans with the International Monetary
Fund. Working alongside the IMF, they restructured the economy
according to their theories. They reversed the nationalizations and
privatized public assets, opened up natural resources (fisheries,
timber, etc.) to private and unregulated exploitation (in many cases
riding roughshod over the claims of indigenous inhabitants), privatized social security, and facilitated foreign direct investment and
freer trade. The right of foreign companies to repatriate profits
from their Chilean operations was guaranteed

Bolsonaro's Economics Minister is literally a Chicago Boy from Pinochet's Chile.

It's free and it's the best documentary I have ever listened to. It's also 25 odd hours long (separated into 5/6 chapters) and packed full of information brillianty presented. Nothing has given me the scope of how complex the wars beginnings, how horrific it actually was, and the lasting impact it has on our world even now.  You can find it on any podcast app. I've provided some links below.

869,"&gt;Love this post, only true inspiration for core values and factual news can be shared by meme. True FB champion I’m guessing.

No idea what you even wanted to say here, I'll avoid hitting you with another meme though.

&gt;It’s not clear to me if you actually  took my post from a literal perspective, or are just translating it as  you choose. But just in case, it was only meant to demonstrate that as  long as our system allows the 0.01% to own all the wealth, we are no  different than totalitarian governments inflicting mass humanitarian  crimes.

I'm not sure if you're serious or a troll when you can't identify the difference between wealth inequality causing problems in a nation and \_literally\_ putting people in concentration camps. I really hope you're a troll.

&gt; Also, not that it was my point, but you have to be living in a silo if  you don’t know capitalism has caused genocide. Starting with Operation  Ajax.  There has been countless covert operations done across Asia,  Africa and South America to remove democratic governments. All to impose  dictators for favourable economical benefits. Puppet governments that  have killed millions in all these countries. You can sprinkle all the  toppings you want on the turd you are falling on your sword for, it’s  still a turd though mate 

So you're upset about American/UK actions during the cold war, not capitalism. You act as if America is the final say of what is a perfect capitalist economy, and if they do something for geopolitical gain, that is a feature of capitalism, not America's political system. You seem to be unable to separate economic systems with politics.

There are plenty of capitalist economies out there that did not participate in those types of actions: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands.

Because it's the only way to get a VAT to be progressive.

&gt; No need to run it through the government and lose efficiency.

You don't use efficiency by running more money through the state. You lose efficiency by making the whole process complicated. That's the main problem with tax law, it's very complicated, which means there will be loopholes, which means that those who can afford to pay people to find and use those loopholes will pay less. A more complicated system also means you need more bureaucracy to check whether or not some rule or exception does apply in any particular case.

VAT is a tax that has very few possible loopholes, and sending every person some money every month or year isn't particularly hard to do either, especially if it is the same amount for everybody.

I don't believe any of that. The Italian state was already very indebted before Covid-19 and now it may be circling bankruptcy, which should probably be avoided if we want to keep the euro intact. I just don't think Italy is hopeless, they just need their economy to grow and then they can come back from this.

1076,"To sum it up nicely - Polish constitution allows for exceptional states, when something is happening, be it either war, pandemic, natural disaster, when the government has the possibility to postpone upcoming elections. elections are scheduled for 10th of May, and since the beginning of quarantine there has been a debate as to whether they should really take place (abviously not). in the current situation and conditions associated with the coronavirus, it is clear that elections will not be able to be held stationary. the only option that can be allowed is to vote by mail. the whole problem is that the ruling party a) says that the constitution does not allow the postponement of elections (allows or even enforces, so a blatant lie), b) decided to hold elections by mail literally a week ago. 30 million people are eligible to vote in the country. to hold elections by mail you need to organize kits, establish a system, prepare. in poland in this way, the minimum number of people votes every year. another problem is the question of Poles living outside Poland - how will they vote? who will provide them with ballot papers? 

I would add that in the course of the amendment of the Electoral Code, where they added a provision that allows elections to be held in this way, they added a provision that states that for hiding, loss, disposal of the electoral card you are automatically threatened with three years in prison (absolutely contrary to the rules of law in Poland) - they're trying to pressure people to vote, so they have enough ballots to claim that the elections were rightful

the ruling party has been violating the integrity of the legal system for years, is inspired by Orban and trying to stay in power. in the current situation, there is absolutely no guarantee that elections will be held fairly.

That means the elections won't be secret which is a constutitional requirement).

Besides that Poles in many countries where there is lockdown might not be able to vote which breaks another requirement (and they might have wanted to go back, but now many borders are closed and flights cancelled).

Besides it's impossible to do a proper campaign when you can't have gatherings (meanwhile current president is doing campaign in state media every day).

Another thing is that election rules should be set 6 months before elections and they are changing them 3 weeks before elections (and even now it's not clear what the rules will be because the law isn't finalized yet).

Then there's the thing with post office demanding personal data of voters to be able to send them voting ballots (there's no law allowing post office to gather such data, and the one that government is working on won't be finalized before elections most likely) - so it's basically random company asking local government for personal data of voters because government said it will at some point make a law that allows that.

The only reason PIS wants to do elections now (when they could just do state of emergency and postpone them as oppositions wants them to) - is because polls show that currently they can win, but as economy goes to shit they will likely lose.

So they introduced all the lockdown measures illegally without enacting state of emergency (for example they made police give out fines without possibility of appeal and banned gatherings).

China complained to the EU at least three times and warned bilateral relations would be hit should the bloc publicly accuse it of spreading coronavirus crisis propaganda, according to European officials.

The Communist government made the protests last week after details emerged of an internal EU report that pointed to evidence of Beijing using “both overt and covert tactics” in a “global disinformation campaign” to avoid blame for the pandemic.

The diplomatic pressure highlights China’s strong pushback against accusations from Europe that it is attempting to use the health emergency to sow division and make strategic gains. The EU published some elements of the internal disinformation report in a toned-down form late on Friday, after a behind-the-scenes row between officials over what to include. 

The warnings from Beijing came after the news organisation Politico reported excerpts from the EU disinformation report on Tuesday. One complaint was made at political counsellor level to the EU diplomatic service’s headquarters in Brussels and two by the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing, European officials said.

Wang Lutong, the Chinese foreign ministry director-general for Europe, called Nicolas Chapuis, EU ambassador in Beijing, European officials briefed on the matter said. Mr Wang denied China was spreading disinformation and said he was alarmed by reports that the European bloc was about to issue a statement criticising his country. He said that if the EU were to follow the US in publicly attacking China, it would be pushed back as the US had been, adding that this would be unfortunate.

Mr Chapuis responded that it was the EU’s duty to document disinformation from China and other countries, adding that such activity should be countered and stopped, the European officials said.

Yang Xiaoguang, a Europe specialist at the Chinese foreign ministry, had earlier warned the EU embassy in Beijing against publication of the disinformation document’s conclusions, according to a bloc diplomatic note first reported by Reuters. Mr Yang said publication would severely harm EU-China co-operation and make Beijing “very disappointed” and “very angry”, European officials familiar with the note’s contents said.

The Chinese foreign ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment. The EU said it never commented on internal diplomatic contacts and communications with partners from other countries.

Mikko Huotari, executive director of the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies think-tank, said the episode showed how the pandemic had prompted Beijing to intensify its efforts to shut down international censure.

“They have been all in on this for months and years and they are pushing it harder now,” he said. “They don’t tolerate any criticism and they don’t seem to recognise that doing this externally will have repercussions for them and their credibility.”

The Chinese pressure sparked a dispute in Brussels during the editing process of a public bulletin based on the internal disinformation report, according to internal emails first reported in the New York Times and seen by the FT. One disinformation analyst raised concerns that changes being made showed the EU’s “apparent willingness to self-censor in response to Beijing’s threats”.

The bulletin published on Friday included allegations of “covert Chinese operations on social media” and attempts by Chinese officials and state media to curb mentions of the city of Wuhan as the origin of Covid-19. The reference in the internal report to a “global disinformation campaign” by China did not appear in the public version.

The EU insisted it had not bowed to political pressure to soften the contents of the published document. It said the bulletin was the product of a normal editing process, adding that it devoted “particular attention” to ensure phraseology in public reports was “unassailable”.",,/r/europe/comments/g8e8ln/china_warned_eu_3_times_over_virus_propaganda/fomy0gu/,johnruby,1587907253

10% of the 600.000 liquidators have died in total, yes. That is normal. People tend to die as time passes. The average age of the liquidators was 34.3. As many of the liquidators were soldiers serving in the army, aged between 18 and 22, it naturally means that another large portion were significantly older than 34.3 years old. Even today Russia and Ukraine have a life expectancy of 70ish, so a 10% death rate is to be expected. Though the number of 10% was given in 2006.

The word ""affected"" is ludicruis. How many people were affected by breathing in smoke from a fire hundreds of miles away? noone knows. But because radioactive atoms are so incredibly obvious – their very existence screams ""here i am"" – is is easy to tell who has been ""affected.""

1144,"LNT is the international, scientifically agreed consensus. Just like climate change : anybody who thinks it's wrong is free to present their evidence to their peers and convince them.      


That being said, as mentioned, it is a complex matter. LNT is a very conservative approach (it has been described as: if one million people dip their hand in luke warm water, one of them will get third degree burn) , because the risk is considered worth having an overestimate rather than a wrong estimate, which is kind of a political decision. For instance, if we were to apply LNT to other risks (chemicals, EM waves, etc) every industry would be as expensive as nuclear. In other cases, ""we don't see any effect below X"" is enough to call it a threshold, for radiation we apply the precautionary principle of ""it doesn't mean there isn't"". We can't exactly pin point the threshold so we say there isn't.

1212,"Yes and no. 

First, the fact that they enacted it through an executive act instead of the law makes it easier for a company to take it to court. It is a mistake but a mistake that strangely helps Le Maire take all the credits for the text. 

Secondly Le Maire ‘s text uses a more limited definition of a tax haven AND « economic reason » is actually a very very very broad definition. If you have even a modicum of economic activity in the place, you are good to go. Most companies dodging taxes nowadays have made sure that they have such an activity to circumvent laws of that type. 

Lastly, the new system will only require the companies to promise they don’t use tax haven in a way that is not in accordance to the law. But to be fair it would have been difficult to control beforehand and if they lie they could be brought to trial so IMHO it’s a good thing. 

However what Le Maire did good is that his system adresses subsidiaries of the companies, not only the HQ. 

In other words it’s a token attempt, with pretty much zero company concerned by the new text but a slight improvement on the part of the subsidiaries.",,/r/europe/comments/g7wkxz/france_joins_denmark_and_poland_in_banning_tax/fomqdp4/,MrBlackTie,1587900060

1244,"I’m sorry if I may have come off a bit aggressive, to be honest I got slightly frustrated that it seemed I was being painted as someone who thinks all cars should be banned, which I personally think would be a really stupid thing to do. I personally believe in incentivizing cycling by offering more and safer options to reduce the congestion that is created by the people living WITHIN the city, not necessarily keep people who commute from satellite towns out. There is a delicate balance to be found where we can increase options for cyclists while still allowing for out of town commuters. I don’t think we need to live on the extremes of ONLY BIKES and ABSOLUTELY NO CAR RESTRICTIONS there should be an in between.
This should mostly effect the most densely populated areas and not a city wide restriction.

Electric vehicles should indeed help, they would have a very good impact on harmful gases in the city just not all particulate matter. if they can be manufactured with less harmful byproducts in the future that would be even better, but they are not perfect and don’t solve all our modern problems and do actually create some of their own. Just to clarify I’m not anti electric vehicles I just don’t see them solving everything.

And people in situations like you and your brother need to be considered when making legislation like this.

It has however hosted a variety of fascist sympathisers, a few even in very prominent roles, it has flirted with anti-antifascist sentiments, with more than just *patriotic* imagery, racism, xenophobia, exaltation of anti-foreign and anti-solidarity rhetoric. It is the perfectly legitimised party in the democratic process that I was talking about.

Casapound and Forza Nuova however, they are small because they are openly and proudly fascist. Make no mistake, they are on the brink of being constitutionally banned but get out of it by their skin because they technically aren't called the National Fascist Party and because many right wing politicians and parties have always stopped any attempts at sanctioning openly fascist behaviors and movements that try to hide behinds a new facade. Many open neofascists can also be found in Fratelli d'Italia, the heir of the Movimento Sociale Italiano through various incarnations; the MSI was the first neofascist movement founded after the end of the war who every other party agreed to leave out of all democratic processes even if allowed in the elections. The one time that the MSI gave a vote of confidence to a government they held their congress in a proudly antifascist city and the protests all over the country were answered with police violence leaving eleven dead in the streets and hundreds injured.

Why vote or take membership for Casapound and Forza Nuova when you can be a fascist and not be considered scum by simply joining other parties that won't ask you to stop being a fascist, only calling yourself one? Scum can't win the elections and enact their policies, but Lega and Fratelli d'Italia can.

1265,"I can't find statistics on city level. But let's try to compare Oslo to Gothenburg. Norway has 219 deaths today. If Oslo stands for 25% then that's 55. We only have statistics on county level in Sweden. Västra götaland county with 1.7 million population has 161 deaths. Oslo has 1 million population if we are talking about entire urban area. 1/1,7 * 161 = 95 assuming it's spread evenly in the county.

Oslo is clearly doing better in this aspect as well but it's much closer. And putting in another factor that we've totally failed on keeping the virus away from nursing homes which was one of the key strategies in Sweden and accounting for about 50% of the deaths while Norway have been successful in this regard. Eliminating nursing home deaths it's pretty equal I would say.

Then this is not a matter of strategies but of circumstances. Sweden has much bigger nursing home generally and once the virus reach one nursing home it's affecting much more people. Many reasons in Sweden has been put to explain this but it's still a f-ck up. But the rest of society seems to be affected in the same way.

Regarding Skåne and Denmark. Skåne county has similar population density as Denmark but Denmark is about 4 times bigger. Roughly the same share of cities.

Their coverage of the protests was often obstructed, or they were prevented from filming, or their equipment was seized. There was also a disturbing increase in judicial harassment of investigative reporters aimed at identifying their sources.

1319,"Highly recommended.  
The country has some amazing architecture and historical cities that are very much worth it to check out.  

From the top of my head, some places I can recommend.  
Utrecht - Quite old city. Still has a lot of architecture from before the 1900's. Also very interesting Canal's different from those in Amsterdam.  

Alkmaar - houses one of our old cheese markets once a week. Has a lot of old historic monuments, and has a Beer Museum which can be quite interesting  

Den Bosch - Lots of old buildings. Even houses ""De Mondriaan"", The Netherlands oldest brick buildings (From the 13th century). But City center also has houses ranging from the 1600's to quite recently. So It's a nice mix between old and modern buildings.  
Also houses De Dieze, An old network of canals flowing though the tunnels underneath Den Bosch.  
And even though it's getting more popular. Most of the time you won't notice the amount of tourists. And It's mostly just people living around.  

Maastricht - Quite well known city, but because of it's distance to Amsterdam doesn't get as much tourist love. Has a great historical city center.  

Groningen - More known as the outskirts of The Netherlands. But even taking a trip to here can be fun. By train from Amsterdam takes about 2 hours. But it takes you through Flevoland. Which was land that didn't even exist from before 1960. Past the lovely town of Zwolle and Assen. Giving a great view of the countryside.  But the city itself is also a marvel to look at. Lots of old classical buildings, and one of my favorite town centers to visit. The atmosphere there is just amazing.  

And honorable mention for me, Enkhuizen. It's a small town not too far from Amsterdam. And it just shows the quintessential classical dutch architecture.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/g7okhg/nijmegen_the_netherlands/fomjwfr/,Rinaldootje,1587892790

Is cycling a solution for everything? No, but cities can be vastly improved by reducing the space given over to cars and increasing the amount of space given to pedestrians and cyclists.

If you have some time to kill, you should start watching [Bicycle Dutch](https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/index-by-theme/) and [Not Just Bikes.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0intLFzLaudFG-xAvUEO-A) They give a great overview of how things actually work.

They also used to only charge for parking in the summer, but made it year-round a few years ago. Do you know what happened? The de facto city centre shifted. Business moved. The old centre is pretty much dead.

Pair bikes even e-bikes with public transit and you can get very far fairly fast sometimes much quicker than in a car. 
Cars will likely for the foreseeable future be required for rural and semi-rural areas, but for high density urban centers they are inefficient, cause harmful pollutants, encourage negative health habits, waste valuable space, waste time with extreme traffic, and have been proven to reduce foot traffic into small stores that are along the roads.

Others, like Estonia, exclude a massive chunk, like 33% social tax (and in addition, some employer's contributions to insurance schemes). Therefore, the data is not comparable and so this graph is rather meaningless.

The fact that Eurostat does this shit is annoying. In fact, I'd claim the definition of gross wages should be harmonized in the EU, so it would actually make sense to compare it, or abolished altogether.

1531,"&gt;The real Euro-drama lies in the erroneous German cliché of the Italian. It has nothing to do with the reality of life - and is in the process of dismantling the EU.

So Italys inability to budget (lasting decades) has nothing to do with its problems, rather the problem is the ""alleged"" german ""view"" of the italians. Seems legit.

&gt;Perhaps it is a consequence of the many mafia films. Perhaps it is simply the envy that Italy simply has the nicer weather, the better food, more sun and sea. In any case, it must be something that explains this urge to insist that we Germans are more economical, more serious and even more trustworthy.

I do not understand how can you generalise and stereotype so much. Also, the fact that Berlin Airport is a failed project has 0 importance on Eurozone or Italys problems   But I already sense the author is not the sharpest pen on the table. 

&gt;Unlike the embarrassing dispute over whether the Germans are taking part in Eurobonds to help others - or instead fantasize that the Italian should have saved sooner. Which may explain the lack of German zeal to finally launch a historic bailout in the EU, as it did at this week's summit. Europe is in danger of a tragedy..

Europe is a continent without immediate dangers. Also, I believe Google translate should not be used to create new topics.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If the Italian state is under financial pressure in a crisis like this, it is because, if it is up to the Italians at all, it is because the country has a fairly high state debt ratio, that is, many loans from bygone times. But this has little to do with the reality of life today, but with a period of actual derailment in the 1980s..

If I take a 30 year credit than I cannot after 15 years say  "" I budget very well except that old credit thing"". I have to plan my budget with that credit in mind as long as I dont repay it.

&gt;That was up to four decades ago. Small thought task: If we Germans had not had so dear friends abroad, who forgiven us in 1953 for some of our debts, we would still be quite stupid with the old burden today. Moreover, after the First World War, Germany demonstrated how it ends when people are to continue paying off historical debts, when the system ended up overturning, as it has been threatening for years in Italy.

Some vague threat that Italy will elect Mussolini v2 will probably not work as an argument, in fact one could view it as a counterargument.

&gt;How much the Italian has actually slammed in recent times - and indeed - can be better seen from the development of current annual state budgets. Since 1992, Italy's governments have been running surpluses in the budget year after year...

If I take a 30 year credit than I cannot after 15 years say  "" I budget very well except that old credit thing"". I have to plan my budget with that credit in mind as long as I dont repay it.

&gt; Dolce vita? Nonsense. Since 2010, public investment in Italy has fallen by 40 percent under austerity pressure, Stirati said. A real collapse. Today, almost a tenth less is invested in education. Mistaken.  
&gt;  
&gt;All in all, real public spending in Italy has stagnated since 2006. By comparison, they have risen by almost 20 percent in Germany since then. And this, Mr Schlaumeier, cannot be legitimised as a supposed compensation for the fact that too much was previously spent on the Italian. In Germany, father state spends a quarter more per capita than in Italy. What is being felt miserably in these weeks.

German father state manages to budget. Its the input/output equation that matters, I cannot understand how can someone look at only one side.

If my neighbour drives a Ferrari that doesnt gives me an incentive to spend more money. The only thing that matters are inputs/outouts not what happens at my neighbours place.

How do people manage not to see such obvious things ? 

&gt;All of this is becoming an incomprehensible drama in the current \[Corona Crisis:\]([https://www.spiegel.de/thema/coronavirus/](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/coronavirus/)) Italy's governments have also cut public health spending since 2010 - while at the same time more has been spent per capita in Germany every year. As a result, italy now lacked even more beds and people who might still be alive today when the pandemic erupted. No direct guilt of German politicians, of course. But it is high time to stop teaching misguidedly - and to help fix the disaster, Mr Schäuble. Or to say ""scusi"".

If my neighbour lives longer that doesnt gives me an incentive to spend more money. 

&gt;Instead, German world declaration clowns are still writing about the ""credit addiction"" of the Italians these days.

German papers write a lot of things, same as everywhere else. To drive some conclusion out of it is idiotic. I mean this article is best example of ""quality"" german papers produce.

&gt;Still questions why in Italy in recent weeks the proportion of people who want to leave the EU has risen to more than 50 percent? 

UK has left, if someone wants to leave - the doors are open.

&gt;None of this can be blamed on the Germans themselves. Behind this is rather a great failure of those who make politics with us quite hands-free in terms of technical aspects, who gerrymander as economic popes or otherwise give in to resentments.

So Italys problems cannot be blamed on the Germans (at least the german people) ? I am truly shocked.

&gt;If Italy's public debt has risen again after the euro crisis, it cannot be because of a lack of austerity. Those who cut taxes in crises and raise taxes make everything worse economically and thus in the budget - and end up with more government deficits and debts than before. With some goodwill, this would have to be conveyed in Germany as well. We are not consistently stupider than others.  
&gt;  
&gt;If \[Hans-Werner Sinn\]([https://www.spiegel.de/thema/hans\_werner\_sinn/](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/hans_werner_sinn/)) has trumpeted the march of evil southern Europeans into the people for years with the over- and misinterpretation of the Target balances, this is more a zest for attitude and, I know, resentment than lack of competence (certainly not). It is a mistake, even former chief economists at the European Central Bank, such as Ottmar Issing, seem to forget all the sober figures, and instead gloomily mutter that the Italian politician only wants Eurobonds to continue to get into endless debt - after the Italian politician has now generated surpluses for more than three decades. What is this?  
&gt;  
&gt;Perhaps Europe needs new German experts first to save it. For some who can now be heard loudly, the good German image in the world is simply too bad.

And some more stereotyping and generalizations. Also for the third time, you cannot be in surprlus by not including your obligations in the equation. Has the author no brain ?

&gt;We are not in the circus. But in a breathtakingly serious crisis. As things go now, the number of Italians who are fed up with this Europe and who no longer want to be told anything about their daily lives will continue to rise by people who seem to have no idea about it.

If people of a country dont want be in the EU - exit is possible. No one should be forced to stay. Also Italians get what they elect, consistently for decades.

&gt;It is high time to stop the drama -blah blah blah

i'm not denying the influence of lenin, its obvious by itself. i'm denying that you can say that its certain that workers right woudldn't exist without lenin, when the guy you replied to showed there were already concessions, and the trend in general was towards workers rights:

&gt;""The Swiss Factory Act of 1877 provided an 8-week ‘rest period’ for mothers, six of which had to follow birth.""

&gt;""The first country to adopt eight-hour working day nationwide was Uruguay. The eight-hour day was introduced on November 17, 1915, in the government of José Batlle y Ordóñez. Nevertheless the law was not effective on all type of works. ""

&gt;""With the  spread of factory work after the industrial revolution, people in Britain ceased to enjoy the  seasonal breaks from work that farming offered. Most workers had the Sunday off, but apart from that the only other time off was during the religious holidays of Christmas and Good Friday.  In 1871, the Bank Holiday Act gave workers a few paid holidays each year - four new public holidays  were introduced in England and Wales, and 3 new ones in Scotland.""


there are probably countless examples, but i won't waste my time. lenin didn't invented socialism or workers rights, and human beings can be decent without your ideology. there is no reason to pretend lenin or stalin or whoever you stan had any monopoly on pressuring capitalist states into making concessions for workers.",,/r/europe/comments/g5xfny/150_years_ago_lenin_was_born/fom8115/,CorrectHippo,1587881042

oh right surely!

&gt; lenin didn't invented socialism or workers rights,

No one said he did, the Russian Revolution put pressure on governments, especially in Europe, to implement measures they'd resisted for decades because they feared a similar revolution. This is an objective fact.

In tons of European countries, it was literally passed within a couple of years. Actually, in some, it was explicitly passed due to actual revolutions inspired by the Russian Revolution, as in Germany.

&gt; The eight-hour day was enacted in France by Georges Clemenceau, as a way to avoid unemployment and diminish communist support. It was succeeded by a strong French support of it during the writing of the International Labour Organization Convention of 1919.

&gt; In Poland, the eight-hour day was introduced November 23, 1918 by decree of the cabinet of the Prime Minister Jędrzej Moraczewski.

&gt; The eight-hour day was signed into law during the German Revolution of 1918.

&gt; In Portugal a vast wave of strikes occurred in 1919, supported by the National Workers' Union, the biggest labour union organisation at the time. The workers achieved important objectives, including the historic victory of an eight-hour day.

&gt; Spain became on April 3, 1919 the first country in the world to introduce an universal law effective on all type of works, restricting the workday to a maximum of eight hours: ""Real decreto de 3 de abril de 1919"", signed by the prime minister, Álvaro de Figueroa, 1st Count of Romanones.

lenin magic works through aproximation? how the fuck does the fact that uruguay was 2 years prior makes it less important?

&gt;No one said he did, the Russian Revolution put pressure on governments, especially in Europe, to implement measures they'd resisted for decades because they feared a similar revolution. This is an objective fact.

&gt;In tons of European countries, it was literally passed within a couple of years. Actually, in some, it was explicitly passed due to actual revolutions inspired by the Russian Revolution, as in Germany.

yep, we agree on that. but it has been shown on this thread that workers had been organizing for years and quite a few countries had been giving in to concessions in terms of workers rights before the russian revolution.

the main mistake you are making is to pretend that the russian revolution happened in a vacuum - the same forces that gave workers 8 hours working days in uruguay created the russia revolution, and those same forces would probably had bought in more workers rights regardless of the russian revolution (as it was the trend before). maybe it would have taken more time, but its impossible to know. mussolini carta del lavoro, for example, was very protective of workers and he had a socialist background (he was named benito after the first mexican native president by his socialist father, for example) - and its hard to connect his ascension to lenin. maybe without lenin, we would today have the same workers rights and quite a few less people would have died terrible deaths under a totalitarian state.
the point is: stop sucking on totalist murderer's balls cause the good they did had a good chance of happening anyways regardless of them.",,/r/europe/comments/g5xfny/150_years_ago_lenin_was_born/fomaai6/,CorrectHippo,1587883080

Like you’ll find fish to be more common in Marseille than Lyon, as it’s a coastal city.

Bush Gardens (and all zoos as far as I know) essentially allow their flamingos to roam. The birds are technically able to roam the grounds, but because of flocking behavior and the way the birds were raised, the entire colony stays in one fairly small area of the park.

No I think you'd be generally making a valid point about how there's a double standard in what the US views as ""acceptable"" loses of civilian life for others it bombs but not for itself.

That being said, I think there's a difference between 9/11 and this bombing in that this bombing was part of a limited campaign that ended when its goals were achieved. It also was a target that was being used by the military and government to send messages, making it relevant to their war effort and thus a valid target.

The Senate actually went through with it, even though the Government and the « rapporteur général » (a senate member tasked with giving expert opinion on matters relating to the State finances) opposed it. So this is the first lie from Bruno Le Maire. 

Then the CMP happened. To expedite the process, MPs needed to agree on the text, down to every last detail. It was at that point that the article of law was deleted. Which likely means that the majority in the National Assembly (which is of the same political colour as the Government) opposed it enough that it could have meant a failure to find a deal, which would have meant several more days of debate just for that article (which honestly, in those conditions, nobody wants: it would expose everyone to unnecessary threat to the health and further delay a much needed stimulus package). And the Senate caved in to save the deal (knowing that they would have lost anyway since in case of no deal, the National Assembly gets to imposé its views). 

What I’m getting at is that it is worse : it’s not only that the Government actually opposed putting this into law. It’s that the Government’s party actually went out of its way to force the Senate to abandon it.

As for why they opposed it, the text that was passed was not well written. It would have prevented companies being in tax Heaven to benefit from the solidarity fund, which can’t be used by companies with more than ten workers or 1.000.000 euros in gross sales or 60.000 euros in gross income (if the company is owned by another, those tresholds are calculated by adding all the companies owned by the « head company »). Which means it would likely have no effect at all. But the thing is (and, having worked in high circles of Government, I can’t stress enough how often it happens and how much it irks me) they could have fixed it but didn’t because it is much easier to just throw away the proposed law than to try to fix it (even though honestly fixing it would have been at most half an hour of work from someone like me).",,/r/europe/comments/g7wkxz/france_joins_denmark_and_poland_in_banning_tax/fol97iv/,MrBlackTie,1587857384

Russians suffered sure, just they suffered the absolute least. Kazakhs suffered magnitudes greater in their own country to the point where they became a minority in Kazakhstan. Whereas Russians in Kazakhstan, again, continued to grow. I’ve given you multiple sources now and I can continue to do so. 

I don’t see how you can argue against that. It’s literally right there.

&gt;	The famine that resulted from collectivization and the confiscation of agricultural commodities in Kazakhstan affected the rural population of the territory to varying degrees of severity. **Nomadic Kazakh society paid the heaviest toll, however, primarily due to the the fragility of the economic basis of nomadic pastoralism when faced with significant losses of livestock**. Unlike grain-based agriculture, the production cycle of herding was devastated by the disappearance of herders’ resources and steep declines in grazing conditions for their remaining herds. Because these condition simpeded the reestablishment of the herds, pastoral populations became extremely vulnerable, as herders became totally dependent on the agricultural products of sedentarized farmers whose own production was largely confiscated by the government. 

&gt;	It has been firmly established, however, that between 1,150,000 and 1,420,000 Kazakhs succumbed to the famine during collectivization (it is widely agreed that these figures included a majority of elderly and children), while 600,000 definitively emigrated (Ohayon, 2006: 268). The Kazakh demographer Makash Tatimov, a pioneer concerning this question, offers several estimates of the mortality rates based on his analysis of the Soviet censuses of 1926, 1937, and 1939, and on the reasonably credible hypothesis that the the Kazakh population was under-reported in the 1926 census due to deception and non-disclosure among certain categories of the population and to the geographical isolation of many nomad encampments. **According to Tatimov’s studies, the number of Kazakhs who died during collectivizationis either approximately 1,750,000 (Abylkhozhin, Kozybaev, Tatimov, 1989: 67) or 2,020,000 (Tatimov, 1989: 124), which he contends corresponds to about half of the Kazakh population.** These figures include mortality due to famine and epidemics, as well as definitive departures from the Republic of Kazakhstan. On the whole, Tatimov’s estimates agree with my own (Ohayon 2006: 267-268),as well as those of Niccolò Pianciola (2009: 463-466), which are based on archival records.",California,/r/europe/comments/g76bvs/a_map_visualizing_the_armenian_genocide_started/fol9fgr/,cBlackout,1587857513

1874,"You cut out the first sentence of that, which carries the most important part:

&gt;Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of **far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism** characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy

The Chinese government fails the far right and ultranationalist qualifiers that definition (which isn't good in the first place) requires. They're moderately right and pretty nationalistic, not ultranationalistic. A way better (arguably the best) definition is Umberto Eco's essay on [Urfascism.](https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf) He came up with a list of 14 qualities to identify fascism.

&gt;The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

&gt;The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

&gt;The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

&gt;Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

&gt;Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

&gt;Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

&gt;The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

&gt;The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

&gt;Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

&gt;Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

&gt;Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”

&gt;Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

&gt;Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

&gt;Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

One of the things he points to there that's very interesting is the double-think regarding enemies both being too weak and too strong at the same time. The Jews are a subhuman race that can never defeat the strong German aryan nation, but they're also engaged in a huge worldwide conspiracy with Marxist to destroy the soul of the German people. It's a very easy way to spot fascist rhetoric early on. Like, take Italy: are they telling you that the EU has you under their boot or are they telling you that the EU has you under their boot, but you're way too noble to be stopped by that? In the second case, it won't take long before they start using dumbed down language to talk about a silent majority while justifying extremely aggressive and destructive policies. Most of those wannabes don't last long, but occasionally a Trump or Bolsonaro manages to ride that rhetoric into office and implement parts of those horrible policies. Doesn't mean every dumb right winger is a fascist though, Boris Johnson is clearly not for example.",United Countries of Europe,/r/europe/comments/g7pals/today_75_years_ago_on_the_25th_april_1945_italy/fol9pfi/,OneJobToRuleThemAll,1587857674

2. The quantity and quality of resistance. Yugoslavia, Poland, the Western USSR, people sacrificed themselves there, they did not give up at the point of a machine gun and defended their freedom.

I can’t say this about France or Italy.

Another part simply was not his supporters, they silently did what they were told.

2194,"Yes I am italian indeed. There are a couple of things I might comment on.

First (just a detail), the government of Italy was not the king. That would be like saying the government in the UK was George VI. Badoglio (an army general *and a die hard fascist*) became prime minister when Mussolini was imprisoned (later to be freed by the Nazis and set to lead the RSI) and negotiated a separate peace with the Allies because things were quickly going south and he obviously wanted to distance as much as possible from Germany in view of the following peace talks. At this point, the central government was still trying to maintain a fascist regime in Italy.

Second (not just a detail), when you said ""As a matter of fact, only few Italian units opposed the Germans, while the majority was just peacefully disarmed"" I don't think you get the facts completely right. Badoglio tried not to make the news of the armistice public immediately to buy time for high-ranking officers and the king himself to get to safety. What it meant for the army on the field was a complete mess, as italian units became formal enemies of their former allies overnight. German units were ordered immediately to treat italians as enemies while the italian army was in disarray and lacking orders from high up. Add that to the fact that italian units were far weaker than germans, so they were easily overwhelmed. Besides, ""as a matter of fact"" there was intense opposition to the nazis from antifascist partisan movements. It was extremely important, possibly not to set the course of the war (which the germans were losing anyway) as much as in shaping the future of the country as a liberal, democratic republic. Granted, partisans were not ""the italian army"", but it was the closest thing to an army there could be at that point in the occupied country (and yes, some italian units did keep fighting alongside the germans, going against the orders from the central govt).

Finally, and please bear this piece of italian history in mind, german units might not have been sent specifically to punish italians, but oh did they. You may visit one of the countless memorials scattered throughout the country to remember those days and those atrocities. That should prove once more that germans did find opposition and (at least part of the) italians were motivated to fight them.

Now, the official government (Badoglio) would have gladly kept the country united after the armistice, but it was split in two with an occupying force in the north that set up the RSI puppet state (just like Vichy France)... I am at loss for a better term than ""invaded"". Unless you consider a puppet state as independent. The fact that German troops were already there is incidental. It's not like a videogame in the Civilization franchise, where upon breaking an alliance enemy units are teleported right outside your borders.",,/r/europe/comments/g7np4n/happy_liberation_day_to_italy_the_national/fojrf0j/,MeglioMorto,1587827798

2222,"&gt; 1) We need to get out. Fresh air and sun is necessary for our health and mood.

It has never been prohibited to go outside and since this week it's allowed to hang out outside (read a book, chill, ...) if you keep enough distance to other people.

&gt; 2) The numbers aren't as high as we would have thought.  2mln sick people around the world is nothing if you compare it to 7 billion population.

That can change pretty quickly.

&gt; 3) Staying home longer than one month lead to depression.

It's not illegal to go outside.

&gt; 4) The covid-19 death rate is not more that 0,5 % so it basically less deadly virus than we expected.

We don't know that yet. And if the hospitals get overwhelmed due to Corona it can kill people who can't get treatment for other issues, like accidents, heart attack, stroke, ...

&gt; 5) Unnecessary precautions. It is like going with face mask putted on to shop, when is hot outside. So breathing is harder than due to illness.

You need to be proactive. Better to have unnecessary actions than no action and and have bad results.

&gt; 6) There is over 600 mln people unemployed. If we won't reboot economy soon it will lead to riot and starvation in long time. Countries and gov don't have enough money to help for whole year.

That's why the restrictions are already being reduced and we shouldn't sacrifice people for the economy. You could be one of the sacrifices.

&gt; 7) Sun UV kills the virus, so I'd rather be outside than inside.

[That statement is wrong](https://www.bfs.de/SharedDocs/Kurzmeldungen/BfS/DE/2020/0414-uv-corona.html) and it is not illegal to go outside. The main way corona spreads is through droplets.

&gt; 8) Social distance is also not as much needed. **No need to stay 2 meters away in open air if you can keep your private self barrier** (like 50 cm, so person behind is not touching you, but when he start to cough you can reach him with your hand and punch him).

Also wrong, distance is the best countermeasure.

If you want to call something ""a defeat"", from the point of view of the fascists, it would be that. During the previous summer the fascist council had voted to remove Mussolini from all positions of power and give the power to the King, who then ordered the arrest of Mussolini and formed a new government. That government and those that followed reverted most of Mussolini's war orders, sided with the Allies and declared war on the Nazi who were occupying the Northern part of Italy (after a botched management following the armistice and the Nazi liberation of Mussolini who then put him in charge of the Nazi-fascist puppet stat in the North).

2450,"individually, yes. Collectively Croatians have a bad past just like the Italians. Ustase were Croatians just like your grandfather. 

Try again when you have a grasp of history, not this shallow Tito propaganda. Italian resistance movement was very sizeable in the North and the Center. Mussolini was trialled and shot by the partisans, precisely because they feared that the allies would pressure us to release him and give him a light sentence. 

The corpse of Mussolini was hanged in Piazzale Loreto, Milan because on that spot a few months earlier partisans were arrested and summarily executed by the Nazis and the Repubblichini (the puppet state set up by the Nazis in the North). The people who vilified the corpse of Mussolini, his mistress Claretta Petacci and some other fascist officials were common people from the working classes of Milan. 

The Nazis tried hard to repress the Italian resistance movement and perpetrated many mass killings to instill fear in the population. 

Look up the [Fosse Ardeatine massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardeatine_massacre), where the Nazis killed in March 1944 (so before the arrival of the Allies) 335 people 10 Italians for every German soldier killed in the partisan guerrilla [attack of Via Rasella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Rasella_attack).

Look up [the massacre of Marzabotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzabotto_massacre), where an entire village of 800 people, children and elderly included, was summarily executed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers by partisans and the Resistance between 29 September and 5 October 1944 (so again, before the arrival of the Allies).

Look up the [Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant%27Anna_di_Stazzema_massacre). 

Were Italians of the time innocent? Definitely not. Were they conniving with the Nazis? Depends. The Repubblichini def, but then again the Repubblica sociale was a puppet state of the nazis that couldn't have survived alone. By 1943 the fascists had lost all legitimacy in the eyes of the Italians and the resistance was getting stronger and stronger. Compare that with Austria and Germany, where the populace clung to Hitler until the last day of his life.",Südtirol best Tirol,/r/europe/comments/g7pals/today_75_years_ago_on_the_25th_april_1945_italy/foj9prj/,standy85,1587813894

2452,"Are you inherently incapable of using your brain?  Just google 'Greek economy' and you will find plenty of articles explaining what Greece produces and how its economy works. The number of workers is irrelevant. 

We rely on services mostly, but we also produce. 

Greece has the largest merchant navy IN THE WORLD. 15% of deadweight tonnage is owned by Greek vessels. So a population of 10m has the highest total deadweight than any other country, at 245m, compared to Japan, which comes second at 224m. Chances are that a lot of the products Turkey makes have at some point been transported from Turkey to another country by Greek-owned vessels managed by Greek shipping companies. This counts for every country in the world that wants to export and import through international waters. 

Our agriculture produce also forms a significant part of EU's output. We are the largest producer of cotton and pistachios in the EU, second in rice and olives, and the list goes on.

In terms of industry, we have a lot of petroleum products, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, marble and more. We also have shipyards that are some of the largest in Europe, and apart from merchant ships we are also a 'leader in the construction and maintenance of luxury yachts'.

There are not Hindus in Pakistan because they treated them like shit, there's a reason there's still millions of Muslims in India that would never want to live in a shit country like Pakistan.

I'm just as outraged by the atrocities commited against the Bosnians in the yugoslav wars. These events need to be discussed openly to remind ourselves we're still capable of awful acts and it doesn't take a nazi party to commit genocide (who, btw, used the Armenian genocide as inspiration).

When it comes to Erdoğan and all the other internal problems of turkey, believe me, I don't blame the Turkish people at all. Without turkey taking on the millions of refugees, the EU would be in the history books by now. I know that you're not happy with your leader, as the Istanbul election showed. 

I'm sorry if most redditors you've met have spouted shallow, unfair judgements on your country. Discussing the Armenian genocide does not come from a place of attacking or criticising Turkey.

It's clear to me that many people have learned nothing from the XX century horrors. So called intelectuals writing from their warm homes about the suffering that foreigners have went through. 

Maybe human beings really cannot live without war, it's a very complex phenomena. Maybe communism is bound to return with so many sympathizers still present and I will have to slit your throats to fight against you. Maybe then your brothers will finally see the horrors that ideology brings and start cursing the name Marx.

A. Solzhenitsyn has a very good insight into this, after all he spent most of his life in a gulag:

""Macbeth’s self-justifications were feeble—and his conscience devoured him. Yes, even Iago was a little lamb too. The imagination and the spiritual strength of Shakespeare’s evildoers stopped short at a dozen corpses. Because they had no ideology.

Ideology—that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination….

Thanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions. This cannot be denied, nor passed over, not suppressed. How, then, do we dare insist that evildoers to not exist? And who was it that destroyed these millions?

2622,"&gt; 1914 de ermeni nüfusu 1.157.422 dir. Yani 1 senede 800bin nüfus yapamazlar(hatta 1 seneden az bile denebilir) 

Bu sayılar eksik ve net doğruluğa sahip değildir. 1880'lerde bile Ermeni nüfusu 2.4 milyon civarında sayılmıştır. Bir çok tarih uzmanı gerçek ermeni nüfusunun 1.3mil-2.5 mil arası olduğunu düşünmektedir. 

&gt; 900bin insan yer değiştiriyor hem de büyük bir dünya savaşında. 300bin ila 500 bin arasında bir kayıp olduğumu düşünüyorum. Devlet arşivlerinde hangi ilden kaç ermeninin tehcire tabii tutulduğu konusunda bilgi alabilirsin. Ayrıca yine devlet arşivlerinde ermenilerin herhangi bir saldırıdan korunması için atılmış imzaların belgeleri mevcut. 

Dostum anlamadığın mesele şu. Bu dönemde ultra Türkçü ve ulusal akımlar Osmanlı'da boy göstermeye başlamıştır. Osmanlı'nın etnik olarak temiz bir ulus olması için, radikal hareketlerde bulununan oluşumlar mevcuttu. Talat paşanın hazırladığı bu olay bir kıyımla sonuçlanmıştır. Ister sayılara 300-500 de, ki bu hiç gerçekçi değildir. İster Ermenilerin ileri sürdüğü absürd bir rakam olan 1.5mil de. Her türlü burada organize ve vahşi bir kıyımdan bahsetmekteyiz. Verilmiş bütün belgeler, atılmış bütün imzalar, ya işe yaramamıştır, ya da bir tiyatrodur. Şayet Ermenilerin bu dönemde korunmadığı ve acı çektirildiği gayet barizdir.

&gt; *Tanık olayına girmiyorum çünkü her iki tarafta tanıklık ettim diyor ve farklı şeyler söylüyor. Birinin tanık olması delil sayılmaz bence.* 

105 yaşındaki Ermeni nene nasıl Türk askerlerinin evinin kapısını çalıp ""Gidiyorsunuz"" dediğini anlatması bence kanıttan fazlasıdır. Bu dediğin şey geçersiz bir argüman.

&gt; Ben insanlar ölmedi demiyorum. Bunun bir soykırım olmadığını anlatmaya çalışıyorum. Asker ihtiyacının çok olduğu bir dönemde askeri soykırım için görevlendirmek sence akla mantığa uygun mudur ? 

Belli bir zaman öncesine kadar bende aynen bu noktadaydım. ""insanlar öldü, ama soykırım değildi! Adına soykırım demeyin."" Şimdiki bilgim ve olgunluğumla bunun ne kadar ahlaksızca ve düşüncesizce bir argüman olduğunu görüyorum. 

Hayatını kaybeden yüzbinlerce Ermeni sen soykırım diyor musun demiyor musun umursamıyor dostum. Senin yapmaya çalıştığın argümanı ben katbekat iyi yaptım, hem de yabancılara karşı savundum. Ama propagandadan ibaret bu. Başka bir şey değil. Olayla ilgili bizim milletimizin oluşturduğu bir reddetme zihniyeti. 

&gt; *Ayrıca eğer soykırımı kabul edersek sonumuz almanya gibi olmayacak. Toprak ve birtakım konularda hak iddia edecekler. Bu da çoğu ilimizin elden gitmesi anlamına gelebilir.* 

Sırf bu konuyu tartışan çok popüler bir postum var. Profilimi açıp okuyabilirsin. Bu inanılmaz bir saçmalık, bir yanlış algının ürünüdür. 

Hayır dostum toprak falan istemeyecekler. Politika çocuk parkı değil. İsteyecek olsalar bile, buyüzden bir soykırımı reddetmeye, hatta meşrulaştırmaya çalışmak ahlaksızlığın ötesindedir. Şerefsizce, namussuzca bir harakettir. 

&gt; Bir de eklemek istediğim bir şey dünya hükümetleri hiç bir ermeni bireyi umursamıyor. Büyük felaket diye nitelendiren ABD şu an suriyede terör estiriyor. Filistinde insanlar katlediliyor. İngiltere, Fransa milyonlarca insan öldürdü fakat hiç bir hükümet bunu dile getirmez.Hükümetlerin bu kadar ermeni soykırımı(!) nı dile getirmesinin sebebi insanların ölmesi değil. Türkiyeyi vurabilcekleri en kolay nokta olduğunu düşünmeleridir. 

Bahsettiğim post yine bu algının da üstünde durmaktadır. Hayır, bu da yanlış bir algıdır. Propagandamız olayı bizim kafamızda büyütmemize sebep oluyor. Dostum, gerçek şu, kimsenin sikinde değiliz. Hayır, Türkiyeyi vuracak nokta aradıkları falan yok. Sikimsonik nedenlerden ötürü bir insan kıyımını reddediyoruz, dünyanın geri kalanı da bu insancıl olmayan, ahlaksızca davranışımıza kızıyor. 

Avrupalıların soykırımlarına gelecek olursak, Avrupalılar bu soykırımları kabullenmektedir, aksine bir iddian varsa kanıtlaman gerekiyor. Ama ""E o zaman neden onlara saldırılmıyor? ÇÜNKÜ ONLAR AVRUPALI DİYE DEĞİL Mİ?"" demek dangalaklığın daniskasıdır. Hayır efendim, Avrupalılar diye değil. Onlar senin aksine gerçek bir soykırımı meşrulaştırmaya hatta reddetmeye çalışmıyorlar. ""Evet, öyleydi, oldu. Ama yapan ben değildim, sorumlusu da ben değilim."" diyorlar.

What is the purpose of making an alliance? From my understanding, ""In case we are under attack, I will help you and you will help me"".

2762,"&gt;For what it’s worth, the “Indian burial ground” trope isn’t about mass graves. It’s about arrogant Americans developing land already sacred to natives, ie ancient spiritual sites.

Quite true, but I think my point still stands - Germany would not respect places that would be meaningful to the Slavic, Romani or Jewish former local population when planning cities. Just look at ""our"" plan for Warsaw, or ""Neue Deutsche Stadt Warschau"". The end result would be something quite similar to most American cities when it comes to former Indian settlements.

The murder of Indians was much, much more unorganised and sporadic in nature, and most importantly, wasn't documented. It gives the whole thing plausible deniability because so much discussion around genocides are dick-measuring contests about numbers. The estimates vary wildly.

It is disingenuous to compare Auschwitz to the Trail of Tears because one was to murder and the other to expel. Just because they're atrocities doesn't mean they should be compared. But otherwise frankly I don't see much of the moral difference between just plain massacres, prototypical biological warfare (Such as specifically denying Indians vaccines) and human ovens. It's people getting killed one way or another.

2799,"&gt; No it's not. Things were not the same back then, and many Ruthenian  Nobles DID Polonise, just as many Lithuanians Ruthenised themselfs,  because Belarus (Or Ruthenia, but then I would also have to include  Ukraine) was then culturally more advanced then Lithuania, was THAT  forced then? 

They did Polonise for precisely same reason why elites of all occupied countries convert and serve occupiers. Because otherwise they stop being elites and gradually get replaced. And they serve occupiers until the moment when new elites rise and replace converts. That's exactly what happened in 1648.

For some ""weird"" reason, this Polonisation, and conversion to ""superior"" culture depended heavily on strength of Polish Army. Apparently no army = no culture.

2803,"Plenty of this I cannot open because its behind paywall. I will get some quotes out:


&gt;It is possible that Norway could have had a higher number of registered deaths if we counted as in Sweden.

Implies possibility of Norway having lower numbers because of counting. The problem that we have is that Sweden has 10x the deaths Norway has. Per capita that amounts to around 6 times. The error would have to be grave.

Then this follows when asked if there are large differences because of counting:


&gt;It's hardly big dark numbers. But we have no guarantee that almost all deaths are reported to us at all times, replies Siri Helene Hauge, senior consultant and specialist in social medicine at the Institute of Public Health, in an email to VG.

&gt;As it is now, most deaths are probably notified before an assessment is done as you do when registering in the Cause of Death Register. For some, covid-19 will probably be the main cause of death, while for others, other diseases will be decisive. So the figures in Norway may be a little too high or a little too low, but there are hardly any major changes if you change the inclusion criterion today, says Hauge


I would also like to point out that Sweden has been doing this for the past three weeks and not from the start of epidemic.  For 2 weeks from end of march to early april, Sweden was counting less excess deaths as coronavirus than France for example [1](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19-excess-deaths-across-countries)",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/g7getl/sweden_is_opposite_of_india_when_dealing_with/foievpb/,Joko11,1587785032

2828,"&gt;  They did Polonise for precisely same reason why elites of all occupied countries convert and serve occupiers. Because otherwise they stop being elites and gradually get replaced. And they serve occupiers until the moment when new elites rise and replace converts. That's exactly what happened in 1648.

I mean Kyivan Rus' was destroyed by the Golden Horde, then Lithuanians took control over those territories and then Ukraine was ceased to Poland. There is a diffrence of people of one country choosing to live with people who took control of that territory and between people who . If Belerusians and Lithuanians can share the same History of GDL, and agree that they both ruled TOGETHER, even though Lithuania invaded those territories before and annexed them, Belerusians were not killed, and heck, those two nations did in fact, **rule together one country.** it wasn't occupation then for Belerusians, it was sharing a country. 

&gt;Because otherwise they stop being elites and gradually get replaced

Your logic makes no sense, how can one stop being an Elite just because they polonised? What do you mean by replaced when those people were still the same people, they just took other nation culture? 

&gt;And they serve occupiers until the moment when new elites rise and replace converts. That's exactly what happened in 1648.

I mean we still had Ruthenians that were Loyal to Polish crown. Like I said, you should really google Galician Szlachta. I just hope that you do know that Khmelnycky also served Polish crown loyaly until he had a big disagreedment with a Polish Noble, (and tbh his anger was jsutified) about estates and his son being hurt. Khemlnycky didn't plan that Uprasing for years. 

&gt;For some ""weird"" reason, this Polonisation, and conversion to ""superior"" culture depended heavily on strength of Polish Army. Apparently no army = no culture.

No, where did you get that? This is something you pulled out of nowhere and has no real evidence, because no, Ukrainian sources are not always correct on Historical matters, dig into also English and Polish ones instead of spreading Lies and Misinformation.

But goo sleep , that is more importent that hanging around on reddit !

That there is a big divide between the north and the south in Italia is know and i agree it's gonna be difficult to fix , will take time and alot of money if it is fixable .  It's not just money that is gonna fix it but also convincing people to stay in the south because they will be able to have the same standard of living as the north . 
It is even going on in more Countries look at Belgie or Spain , hell Catalonie tried to get away from Spain  , even Holland and Germany have that problem . There is a brain drain going on in every country ;people tend to go where there is a concentration of money and what they think off as a beter way of living. Mostly younger people and that is potential and money  that is lost since they won't come back .

In regards to the ""Troika ' i have a question .  As far as i know ,and that is what i got from all the press in this regards  so please correct me if im wrong  , Italia asked for money and the respons was 'anything corona releated , just let us know what and you will get it  no conditions attached , no questions asked .
After that .....things got complicated it seems , but you need to let me know if its correct or not . I dont even think ""correct""is the right word.
This in my personal opinion boils down to  what is  said and what is recived/ heard 

Populisme is on the rise everywhere , the last crisis whiped out the middle class everywhere , or atleast they took the brunt of the ""austerity"" everywhere . Lower economic classes used to make up the mayority of voters for ""popular"" parties .  Lower the welfare off the middle class they tend to go vote for the ""easy solutions . Easy solutions being the parties that use scape goats : It's all their fault ! If we get ride off them all the problems will be a thing off the past ! Yeah right lol.

I understand that there are advantages to a fedral Europe and i can see why people would want that .
But you, as in Italia, and also we , as in The Netherlands ' where there when this was born .
It was a mechanisme to controle the coal and the steel production so none of that could be used to build wapons without anybody knowing.
It did evolve over time and it did bring alot of good stuff, free movement of people, production and money and so on . All was well and everybody was happy , atleast i think so .

Turning point came with the Maastricht Treaty, people thought it went to far and rejected it in referendums.
Eu as a institution was stubborn and thought we shall fix this and started building on a crooked foundation .

So now its 2020 and there is a real problem : Corona .
The house that was build on a foundation with cracks is falling apart .
Are we gonna tear it down and build it right or are we gonna keep patching shit up ?
And just to make this clear  ....this isnt about people or Italia , nobody wants anybody struggling , but the big questions need to be dealt with  else there wont be anything to patch. Doesnt mather wo kick the hardest , the north or the south , its gonna come crashing down , but it can't go on being built on this foudation.

There is a very strong north-south economic divide in Italy, and the south is a bit of a black hole, so we spend a lot as to get all of Italy on par. As we have seen, the Troika imposed austerity measures ruined Greece when it needed to revitalise its economy. Austerity would likewise crumble the at the moment fragile Italian economy. Considering everything that I’ve said, the hurdle slowing us down right now is the rise of populism. On top of that, as European Federalist, what is also worrying me is the response the EU gave when Italy asked for help.

The reason they (the polish communists but actually their masters in Moscow) considered it necessary to deport the German local majority was because the experience countries like Czechoslovakia (and also locally around Danzig) had with Germany seeing an interest in regions with Volksdeutsche as well as local unrest and the danger of formation of pro German local militias in case of war with a re risen Germany or a Germany aligned with the west.

Isn't that oxymoron nowadays, if not by definition at least de facto? Neo-liberals are the only ones interested in internationals at this point.

&gt;Croatian Foreign Minister and former ambassador to Hungary also quoted the saying: ""**Brother by brother, Hungarian by Croat**"".

&gt;Hungary has all border crossings open only to Croatia, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said this morning after meeting with Croatian counterpart Gordan Grlic Radman at the Gorican-Letenye border crossing, and as evidence of good relations between the two countries he said that ""**despite  to the pressure of the international liberal mainstream, it has not joined a chorus that has been constantly attacking and stigmatizing Hungary in recent weeks and months.** ""

&gt;It is difficult to resist the pressure, because those who do so will also become the target of the attack, but in recent weeks we have seen serious solidarity with Croatia, which has not joined any unjust attack on Hungary - Szijjártó said.

&gt;Hungary, more precisely its government and the ruling Fidesz Party, have been the target of criticism from much of the EU, as well as the European People's Party, for years over lack of democracy.  Attacks on Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have intensified in recent times, with the advent of the coronavirus crisis, when a law was passed extending a state of emergency without a clearly stated duration, allowing the prime minister to rule executive orders. 

&gt;The move, dubbed the Corona-dictatorship, was shared by 15 countries - Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, Lithuania and Latvia, agreeing that  it is legitimate to adopt extraordinary measures to protect citizens, but not at the expense of the rule of law.  The measures should be limited to what is necessary, they should be temporary and proportionate and subject to regular monitoring, they said.  Croatia did not join its signatures because, as we were told at the time by the MVEP, it is common for countries that preside over the EU Council not to join the statements of a group of Member States because of the role of a neutral mediator.

&gt;Also, EPP President Donald Tusk has sent a letter to all members of that political family calling ""using a pandemic to build a permanent state of emergency"" politically dangerous and morally unacceptable, urging those who have opposed Fidesz's expulsion from the EPP  to think again.  At present, the fate of Fidesz under the EPP is in the hands of the ""council of wise men"", and until they make a decision, the party is suspended.

 &gt;Croatian Minister Gordan Grlic Radman thanked for the donation of 100,000 masks and 5,000 protective suits, as well as for assistance after the Zagreb earthquake, and recalled that in 1991 Hungary was among the first to seek Croatia's international recognition, and in 2001 when it held the EU presidency,  om actively advocated for Croatia to complete negotiations with the EU.  The head of Croatian diplomacy and the former ambassador to Hungary also quoted the saying: ""Brother by brother, Hungarian by Croat"".

 &gt;The prime ministers announced the opening of new border crossings with Croatia and discussed the coronavirus epidemic and in the context of the Hungarian ministers' arrival to Croatia.  It remains to be seen how this will be resolved, Radman Grlic said, noting that a video conference of EU tourism ministers will take place on April 27.  - We do not have the right answers yet, but it is life that must win - said Radlic Grlic.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/g7enul/hungarian_foreign_minister_croatia_did_not_kneel/fogr8kl/,badblueboy146,1587756063

3256,"Not sure why you're offended on me taking account of Talaat Pasha's notes as it is the most reputable for how many Armenians had been deported and how many managed to make to the final destination. I also take Nazi records when it comes to Holocaust, as you can expect. Also, if we are talking about Armenian Genocide, I'd rather think about the mass deportation exclusively but even if we are to include 1918-1923 figures, I doubt if we can make to upper figures like 1.5-2 million. Also, Talaat Pasha's figure that is 972000 is for ones that have been deported. It solely makes the figures like 1.5-2 million a bit unrealistic, while of course death tolls doesn't matter when it comes to consider it a genocide anyway. 

&gt; Which is still a twisted way to assess the scale of a genocide. The outcome for Armenians, among others, was a loss of the majority of land and independence, while one of the outcomes for the Jews was instead a gain of an independent country for themselves. Does that mean the Holocaust was a more minor event relative to the Armenian Genocide? 

European Jews were genocided in an industrial scale and European Jews had been exterminated to rubles in many places. Intent was to literally kill each one of them. Same for Gypsies. Israel barely is a direct outcome more than Armenia in South Caucasus is an outcome of genocide and mass massacres towards Western Armenians. 

Many other nations I've listed also got their countries literally cleansed from the face of the earth for decades, and lost more of their entire population and/or exterminated with an intent of extermination rather than solely a death march. That also answers your other question.

Dude, I do have my grandmothers side genocided as well in a genocide recognised by European Parliament. Yet I wouldn't feel enraged if someone says Tasmanian Genocide or Holocaust was worse. You shouldn't feel such a weird rage either imo. 

&gt; Not biased at all.

No? Crimean Tatars has been mass deported because some got collaborated with the enemy of Stalinist Russia, their country got destroyed and their properties were given to others. They have lost ~20 to ~45 percent of their population as well in a death march and massacres. So, pretty much like Armenian Genocide.

&gt;Exaggeration by western media

I said it is in implementation. That is no exaggeration by the ""western media"" but alarming articles about how a totalitarian goverment is likely to bring about a dystopian future, starting from China. The fact that everyone knows about it does not disprove its immoral and human rights-threatening nature. 

&gt;Happens in the best country in the world, the leader of free world: USA.

The fact, that instead of trying to disprove the core my argument, you try to shift blame to a different country shows how weak your stances are. If you want, we can discuss the war crimes of the US as well, I am in no way affiliated with them. My argument stays.

Please also refer to the abduction and whereabouts of Li Heping and more than 200 lawyers and associates having been detained as part of the crackdown, with many still in custody:

So the turks under atatürk punished the ottoman officers involved, Enver (one of the main actors behind the deportation) wasn't even allowed to be burried in turkey.

You really think I'll try to find satellite maps of Chinese concentration camps? Who goes around telling please locate XY coordinates because this is where you will find the concentration camps? No one.

But here you go mate:

Construction bids and tender notices have surfaced that Chinese government officials posted online as they sought companies to build the camps. Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany, has found and listed more than 70 of them. Many bids specify that the compounds must include high walls, watchtowers, barbed wire, surveillance systems, facilities for armed police forces, and other security features, according to Zenz.

He has also cataloged official recruitment notices for camp administrators, which he told me have “suspiciously low educational requirements, such as a middle-school education.” If the camps were really vocational schools, as the government now claims, they would be recruiting staff with college degrees.

&gt;Yes, there are surveillance in China, probably more so than most countries, but it is what China thinks it needed; Just like UK with their high density camera surveillances, MI5, 6, and USA with their global surveillance, CIA, NSA, FBI..etc.

You've just proved my point. ""More so than most countries."" China takes surveillance to the extreme where now there's a social credit system in implementation - and don't even try to convince people how that is for their own good. The fact that the Chinese goverment thinks it's ""the best"" for their people, proves nothing about it being ""the best"" for said folks. Quite the contrary.

&gt;These are all facts that you can check on the internet.
So are the facts that Chinese policemen detained and beat poresters even after disarming them, twisting and breaking their wrists and even torturing them:

In July, there was a crackdown on lawyers who worked on cases involving free speech and abuses of power. Amnesty International says that 245 lawyers and activists have been targeted since July. One of the best known, Li Heping, is still missing.

You actually need a lot - like, A LOT - less greats in there. You wrote 121, but if you take an average ""generation"" (as in, the time it takes from a person to be born and have a child) to be 25 years, then you're only 44 generations removed from the late-800s, which was the peak of Viking incursion into the British Isles. (44 generations x 25 years = 1100 years)

In comparison, it reads like this instead:

great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandmother.

What you wrote, 121 generations ago, would roughly come out to 3,025 years ago, so roughly around 1,000 BCE, smack in the middle of Bronze Age Britain and at least 900 years before Julius Caesar invaded the island.

3481,"Maybe I can give some explanation on taxes as I have seen a lot about taxes coming up the last few days. The Netherlands is not a tax haven (Ireland and Luxembourg also are not). However, it is/was sometimes used for transfering money to tax havens. Companies based in the Netherlands pay corporate income taxes, just as companies do in any other European Country. 

The last few years a lot of new (very strict) regulations have come into force/or will come in to force to tackle (legal) tax avoidance. The EU adopted regulations made by the OESO (BEPS project). This new set of rules, also known as the ATAD II directive, went into force in the beginning of 2020 and effectively eliminates a lot of structures used for avoiding taxes in the past, i.e.hybrid mismatches etc.

In the beginning of 2021 a new witholding tax will come in to force in the Netherlands resulting in any payments made to tax havens being taxed against the corporate tax rate. 

When I still did an internship at a big law firm I didn't see any company making use of tax havens. Simply because it is not possible or attractive anymore to do so. 

A lot of progress has been made the last few years and in my opinion a lot of stuff about taxes you read in the media is biased, based on older information,exaggerated or pulled out of context. Taxes are quite a diffcult subject and in my view some people simply forget that taxes are regulated by law and that sometimes governments can also lose in court...

3493,"There were internal debates during that time in the Ottoman government , if the new nation should be just a Turkish nation, or an ottoman nation. After the Ottoman Empire was divided up , there was a Turkish rebellion and rejection of the treaty of Sevres, which carved out a large Armenian state in eastern Turkey . 

What is interesting is in the lead up to this Kurdish leaders knew the government wanted to exploit the religious differences between the Kurds and the Armenians , having the Kurds massacre the Armenians for the government , and there was a strong effort by Kurdish leaders in the late 1800’s to try and avoid this , making joint Armenian Kurdish schools, and trying to bridge the community. Alas this was in vain as there fears came true , and interesting enough there grim future predictions came true , that if they helped the Turks get rid of the Armenians...they would be next on the list. 

Interestingly enough 5000 Yezidi Kurdish cavalry helped the Armenians in there last stand at the battle of Sardaped , which is responsible for the modern borders and stopping the Turkish advance.  I highly recommend recommend reading about this battle , it reads like something out of lord of the rings.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sardarabad



Turkey wanted as much territory as possible, and didn’t want to share it with the Christians of the land ( Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians , etc ) , so they decided to eliminate them in the chaos of WW1 as the empire was falling apart. 


The issue for modern Turkey is they have elevated Ataturk as this founding father , founder of the nation...he was the one who was fighting for a Turkish nation stretching from Istanbul all the way to The Caspian Sea , in the way is a bunch of Armenians , most of whom are already refugees or massacres moving East into the mountains. Ataturk and his nationalist movement is also responsible , and this is the problem for modern Turkey , he is a worshipped figure there. I honestly don’t get why he is a founding father , when the Turks have been in Anatolia and have had very impressive Sultans and  leaders before. The Ottoman Empire has famously made life unpleasant and had bad relations with the native Christians that lived in the empire for most of its duration, and this was the final ottoman parting gift , not just the Armenians , but Greeks and Assyrians as well. Greek cities that have been populated since the times of Plato were put to the torch.

If you want to know how it’s possible for people to do things like this, they did live in one nation for almost 800 years , how could this not have healed...I would encourage you to read ottoman history of how they delt with local Christians , they had to pay very hard taxes , would have there kids taken away to be slaves, eunuchs , and harem girls . There was a law against doing this to Muslims...lucky for them they had a pool of local Christians they could continue to harrass.",,/r/europe/comments/g76bvs/a_map_visualizing_the_armenian_genocide_started/fofeoyh/,Historicalbuzzkiller,1587734204

3503,"&gt;Why the aggressive tone? 

Because I'm tired of people taking a single piece of data, twisting it sometimes and use it against my country. This thing of the tax evasion keeps coming up as if Italy was the only place where taxes are evaded. Yes, there's on average more taxes being evaded but taxation is really high (so when you evade, you evade more), organised crime is based in Italy and controls the majority of certain trades in the black market on a continental level, and the phenomenon of the shadow workers is often times the only way for young people to have any income at all. 

&gt;The gist of my message was that taxes could be lowered if the shadow economy and tax evasion was brought under control.

Yes, and it's not like we're not trying. Thanks to the Conte government FINALLY they are addressing card payments and giving incentives switch away from cash, among other things. It will also be possible for illegal immigrants to get their papers sorted if they get a work contract. 

But when it comes to the mafia, at this point it's a continental problem. They have business everywhere, also in legal activities, also in Finland don't worry.

Not really because no country is a monolith. There are countries with, for example, less racism but you'll still have racist people, some of who will be very high profile.

Or you'll have a country where people in power claim to value science and education but then implement policies that show the opposite.

The problem is that you're looking for something that doesn't exist but also *can't* exist. The problem isn't *just* that people are racist, don't value science, and aren't willing to provide healthcare and education for the population. The overarching problem is that those people can get into positions of power and aren't really opposed when that happens.

The truth is it's near impossible to prove what historical concsus is, howeve I think you'll be hard pushed to find a non politicized respected historian who seriously argues it was Genocide. Even the book that CI is recommending does not push the narrative it was Genocide because frankly it is pretty demonstrable it wasn't.

3699,"&gt;The monetary Union should have come with a fiscal union. The EU economies are heterogeneous to say the least and the € brought benefits to Germany and other northern countries.

Absolutely. I have often said that the EURO as we have it today is not a good thing.

But then you have to remember that a fiscal union requires way more accountability by all sides and a trade of sovereignty by all.

Is Italy willing that the EU has a say in its finances. It doesn't look like it. After all, the EU also created the ESM. 

You can say that Germany was the driving force in how the ESM was designed, but why would it not be the driving force in the EU with how the finances are handled in a true fiscal union?

&gt; Now, your argument allows for cherry picking, small debt is ok, big debt is a no no. 

That argument comes from a decision of our constitutional court, the very same i linked above. No government of Germany is allowed to make financial decisions that can impact the fiscal sovereignty of future governments.

The core issue is that all power comes from the German people. All power means no power form non-Germans at the same time. The government isn't allowed to trade away that, as it isn't the owner so to speak.

And these things are protected with an eternity clause. You cannot change our basic law to make this happen. You can only replace it entirely and that requires the German citizens to vote for it in a referendum.

&gt; Italy and others shit on you because of Eurobonds, in our view, you only took care of your interests in the Union all of this time. 

Yes, and i can shit back on them that Eurobonds are entirely useless for this crisis. Bringing up something that is useless is pure insanity.

So let's say that yes, Germany decides to support Eurobonds. It would take years to make the necessary change IF they happen at all. A new basic law has to be drafted, parties must be able to make cases for and against them and then the citizens must vote for them. This takes years. Replacing a basic law isn't something you do on the quick.

And i can only believe that we would vote for the change if it was to make the EU a true federation. Which again requires Italy(and all other countries) to say goodbye to their financial sovereignty and also would make the German voice in all of this stronger. German citizens are underrepresented in the EU. This would have to end in a federation, as we aren't worth less than others, our voice isn't quieter than others.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/g6u5x2/merkel_open_to_big_eu_recovery_fund_but_needs/foeyz8y/,Alcobob,1587719846

3717,"At the macro level it’s a very, very good thing for the economy as a whole. Many people who would be a perfect fit for a job aren’t located close to the office. Sure, some people move, but many don’t. There are all kinds of frictions to doing so, including friends and family, being unable to afford rent/cost of housing, moving costs, family life disruptions like changing schools and daycare, selling/buying cars, etc. These people working from home could now do the thing they were born to do. They’re happier and the employer gets a stellar employee. The other side of this is that people can *start* companies from anywhere, and be based anywhere. Without the friction of having to be based near expensive hubs there will be all kinds of new innovative companies popping up.

That’s one factor. Another is commute. Many people spend hours every day commuting. This time is taken out of both work productivity *and* family time. These employees are now less productive and unhappier - which makes them even less productive. This wasted time is *huge.* Now consider the costs spent on unneeded transport. All the trains and cars and infrastructure required to support millions of people going to an office every day. Huge sunk costs. Now consider the pollution involved in moving those millions of people from one side of the city to the other twice a day. It’s absolutely terrible for the planet.

Further, allowing people to live anywhere in the country - or even world - will help smooth out grossly mis-priced realestate. People are spending their life savings and shouldering themselves with a lifetime of debt to buy a house/apartment close to work. There’s no utility in doing this and that house doesn’t actually produce anything. Those people are going to have depressed consumer spending for life, and that’s awful for the economy.

3747,"&gt; Poland’s plan to hold a presidential ballot during the coronavirus pandemic is making a mockery out of what should be a free and fair election, the outgoing Supreme Court chief justice said.

&gt; Malgorzata Gersdorf said the government, which has been accused by the European Union of flouting the rule of law, is wrong to pursue the May 10 ballot after it imposed a strict virus lockdown and opposition candidates halted campaigning. It’s also planning to hold the vote via an untested mail-in system that isn’t in place weeks before the election.

&gt; “There’s lots of question marks concerning the presidential elections,” Gersdorf, 67, said in a video interview from her office this week. “Just to mention the fact that candidates can’t present their views during the election campaign -- in this sense it’s a farce.”

&gt; With just weeks ahead of the vote, it’s not clear whether the election will be held as planned or whether it will be delayed as demanded by the opposition and some ruling coalition lawmakers. The push for the vote has amplified concerns that nationalists are using the virus as cover to eliminate democratic checks and balances, after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban won the right to rule by decree indefinitely.

&gt; Gersdorf became the face of defiance against the ruling Law &amp; Justice Party’s overhaul of Poland’s judiciary two years ago when it changed a law to force her into retirement in the middle of her term. The EU cried foul and managed to compel the cabinet to reinstate her.

&gt; But as her six-year tenure at the court ends next week, Gersdorf fears the government is using the pandemic to further undermine democracy.

&gt; “Under the guise of the fight with the coronavirus, which obviously is necessary, restrictions of civic rights may be prolonged and at some point we’ll all get used to this,” she said. “Everything is possible during this march toward authoritarian rule.”

&gt; The European Parliament, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other human-rights think-tanks have called on the government to delay the election. Opinion polls show the ballot will be won by incumbent Andrzej Duda, a government ally.

&gt; The judiciary has been the main point of conflict in Law &amp; Justice’s reform effort, which it justifies by a need to better align the courts to the will of the people. Gersdorf became one of the campaign’s most publicized victims.

&gt; When she was forced to retire in 2018, a decision she never accepted, she recused herself from all cases and continued to go to work. Her days often started with makeshift briefings to reporters outside the Supreme Court as supporters called on her to defy the law.

&gt; The opposition and some pro-democracy advocates want her to block Supreme Court justices, who were appointed in a process deemed flawed by the EU, from ruling on the validity of the presidential election.

&gt; She has resisted, saying that regardless of her views, she won’t be part of the Supreme Court that will decide on the ballot’s validity. After recent rule changes, Duda will have more sway in picking her successor.

&gt; “I have one message for my successor: You have to defend judicial independence,” she said. “If that’s lost, Poland will slide toward authoritarianism.”",,/r/europe/comments/g75cxa/polands_lockdown_election_is_a_farce_supreme/foezk3u/,mulgrave2,1587720473

As of 5 months ago, the 8000 persons that used the Portuguese ""Golden Visa"" program are mostly from China, Russia, South Africa &amp; Turkey.

90% of the 5MM€ ""invested"" since 2012 ended up in the housing market (Lisbon &amp; Porto specifically), causing the bubble we live in today. So not only did they get a eu-visa, but they were allowed to do so in ways that guaranteed huge returns financially at the cost of the financial stability of the residents.

There was no Turkification (is this actually a word?).

Read the Turkish side's arguments too. Like Armenians fighting on the Russia's side and stuff. I guess hence the decision to move them (this Tehcir Law or something)? The way it was done quite brutal though it seems. Surely there was a better way? Saw some pictures of Armenians with Russian army uniforms and eh...

3881,"yeah no one's interested in your personal feuds so keep it to yourself.

facts are: all Polish governments in the last 20 or so years have neglected wildlife protection. EU  had a part in forcing Poland to establish protected habitats, but other than that nearly all politicians were happy to pour concrete over hectares of meadows and natural channels.

Poland will certainly suffer due to the climate change (which we are also responsible for, thanks to our coal-fuelled power plants and burning garbage). It could suffer less, if the public institutions took action to limit its negative effects. From what I understand, the current plan for water management will literally bleed the country dry- it involves such brilliant ideas as: regulating riverbanks within the protected habitats and preventing seasonal flooding, digging trenches to allow water transport (even though most rivers in Poland will never be deep enough to allow that).

From what I see (and I'm hardly a specialist, so I would very much appreciate some more educated opinion on this) the current administration took an idea that worked in Germany and France (developing water transport and decided to implement it in Poland without ever realising how fundamentally different our situation is- Polish rivers are shallow and are elemental to the existence of natural parks, Polish soil is mostly dry, and Poland could easily replace the road transport with railway transport instead of waterways.

Regulating Polish rivers would take decades and tens of billions of euros, and as all experts agree, would be an environmental and economical disaster. There isn't any convincing explanation as to why the current administration wants to go on with this plan (other than using the opportunity for another money grab)

and then ofc there is the fact in one year they had spent 10x more on propaganda in the public tv then on water management. but that's non of my business. oh wait, it is, cause my house might burn down. nevermind that then",,/r/europe/comments/g6uhp7/wildfires_rip_through_polands_biggest_national/foet95z/,NOT_S0_SMART,1587713976

You would think people would unite against the greater evil with little issue but that's far from true. During the initial rise of Islam the idea that some Arab nomads could take on the Persian and the Byzantine Empires simultaneously was utterly ridiculous. But they did. Fighting age old internal enemies was a bigger priority. The Byzantines were famously too busy fighting and killing the ""wrong"" kind of Christian to stop the loss of most of their territory to the Muslims.

Or more recently for these events, France was so internally divided that, even though there were no pro German voices during Hitler's rise, even stopping the remilitarization of the Rheinland and the Anschluss of Austria were somehow controversial issues.

I have great respect for France but you can shove your baguette with this crap.


&gt;French High Command's belief that the Ardennes forest was impassable to tanks, even though intelligence from the Belgian army and from their own intelligence services warned them of long armour and transport columns crossing the Ardennes


&gt;French war games in 1937 and 1938 had shown that the Germans could penetrate the Ardennes and Corap called it ""idiocy""


&gt;French prime minister telephoned the new British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill and said ""We have been defeated. We are beaten; we have lost the battle.""


&gt;Churchill asked General Gamelin, ""Où est la masse de manoeuvre?"" [""Where is the strategic reserve?""] that had saved Paris in the First World War. ""Aucune"" [""There is none""] Gamelin replied. After the war, Gamelin claimed his response was ""There is no longer any.""


&gt;Churchill asked Gamelin where and when the general proposed to launch a counterattack against the flanks of the German bulge. Gamelin simply replied ""inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of methods""


&gt;Ironside then asked Gort under whose command he was acting. Gort replied that this was General Billotte, the commander of the French 1st Army Group but that Billotte had issued no orders for eight days


&gt;Paul Reynaud had sacked Gamelin and replaced him with Weygard, who claimed his first mission as Commander-in-Chief would be to get a good night's sleep.


&gt;Weygand took several days during the crisis to make courtesy visits in Paris


&gt;Billotte, the only Allied commander in the north briefed on the Weygand plan, was killed in a road accident, leaving the 1st Army Group leaderless for three days. That day, the British decided to evacuate from the Channel ports



Wikipedia does a great job of explaining what happened to the Brits and France and has enough sources to back it up. The points above do a great job of pointing out how crap Frances high command was and how far up their own ass they where and almost dragged Britain with them.

England changed their language and the name of their country, as did Brittany. Turkey and Brittany are similar.

4185,"&gt;Do you think there aren't some norms in society that can be harmful to individuals? 

No one questions that a bunch of guys fighting over a girl is harmful to each other. The question is: ""compared to what?""

Do you want to randomly assign every man a woman? Won't that harm women? 

Women want the best which is why they tend to marry people higher class or similar but rarely down.

Maybe guys wouldn't have to fight over each other if women would settle for less.

But isn't ""settling for less"" being harmful to whoever has to settle for less?

(I could go on this train all day)

----------

&gt;Why do you think some guys are so resistant to seek help for mental health, or go to the doctors at all? 

Because women want guys who are strong and competent. Showing mental weakness is like bowing your head to competing males. Furthermore, men's issues are not treated as seriously as women's issues. 

&gt;I don't know why you're comparing us to animals either. 

We are animals with rules. The moment authority leaves we run wild.

&gt;It's not considered an awful crime when an animal kills a super young animal for food or because they're just retarded, but clearly we don't see that the same way in humans. 

You're right, we abort babies because they're a nuisance. 

&gt;Acting like we should have the same norms as an animal does is just bizarre.

I'm not making a claim of SHOULD. I'm saying that the idea that masculine traits are somehow toxic is toxic that all males are toxic.

We are all biologically driven by factors out of our conscious control and the sooner you realize that the sooner you'll realize why men do terrible things despite ""knowing better"".

You have completely glazed over the point I am making. Everyone puts in more they all get more in the long run.

These are investments into a body that spends to make the Eurozone stronger and ultimately creates more trade and jobs in the long run as demonstrated reputedly over the decades. I'm simply saying investing and profiting in the long run is best. We all know this.

As for the state issues you mentioned 30bln is not going to solve that. Not even close. You know what would? Pulling more cash into the country via more trade in.tbe long run.

OK, if your argument is that we should look at COVID as an isolated incident free from the context of the actual reality of the last 40 years of southern budgets, nothing in COVID would make mutual debt a necessity. Just give debtors hard guarantees, like control of state assets, or state land. You'll get as cheap money as everybody else. Of course, if you default or start talking about haircuts, the debtors will just take the assets, but I'm sure that you'll assure everyone that the debts will be paid back, so that doesn't matter, right?

4228,"Allow me to give you an example that reached such levels of ludicrousness [it gave a small country's fighter acquisition program its own Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTV_A-7P_Corsair_II).

Since the early 70's, Portugal had wanted to replace its obsolete F-86 Sabres. Various attempts were made, but between the (rightful) arms embargo and then the turmoil of the democratic transition, it wouldn't be until the 80's we got a replacement. It's key to note we wanted an *air superiority fighter*, to defend our airspace - we had ground attack covered, albeit with older aircraft. 

The only affordable way was to have them as payment for the US lease of Lajes Field. No shortage of fighters on offer, but... that's not what *they* wanted for us. You see, US defensive doctrine left Iberian air defense in the hands of the Spanish Air Force and the USAF squadrons at Torrejón, while Portugal would be tasked with securing Atlantic resupply lane. And as such, in such a wonderfully diplomatic move, they inflated the price asked for any fighter and left the A-7 Corsair as the only aircraft they'd sell for an apt price.

And as such, we had to wait until 1994 for a fighter aircraft to defend our own skies with.

4241,"&gt;They are bailed out by the government taking over their largest costs (salaries).

Not exactly they are forcing businesses to shut down and as a result the businesses would usually just lay off the workers for a few months wich would cost government more money in welfare as a result the government is paying part of the wages.

&gt;So why is it unreasonable to ask these companies to then have a lower profit margin when things get back to normal and the government helped them getting out of the crisis in a better shape. 

I never unreasonable I just said it was stupid because it means the recovery will be far slower and u.s companies will take over.

&gt;Because if they need to fire all those people now, it means less profit for them later also since less work can be done.

Not really it would be just as profitable to for many companies shut down and stop paying wages completely. And it would be far more profitable if the government hadn't enforced a quarantine(which was the right move as people matter more than money) if the government forces a business shut down no matter what the reason its perfectly fair for the companies to want money return..

&gt;You can put brackets on things like this, just like with personal income. Make up to 50 or 100 million profit, normal rate. Above that is scales. There is no corruption or nepotism in that, that is a simple way progressive taxation works.


How about a company with a revenue of 100billion but a profit of 20 million. Do you tax it at the lower rate or higher rate? 
A progressive tax wouldn't work for companies because you cant create fair brackets for companies and it would be very easy to exploit them. While if you taxed on revenue youd kill low margin businesses like aircraft leasers or retailers.

&gt;because God forbid the profit margins will be a bit lower for a few years.

4281,"The conditions the normal market required for Greek government bonds were way worse mid 2010, with interest rates around 15%. 

A scenario where Greek unemployment would not have skyrocketed does not exist. It is a fantasy. The amount of money Greece needed was too large. In 2009, Greece's budget deficit was €36 billion, on tax revenue of €49 billion (excluding social security contributions), and the unemployment rate already was 10.7%, and increasing. The Greek government had employed hundreds of thousands it could not afford to have on the payroll. Greece's national debt at the end of 2009 was €300 billion. That was before any Troika, before any bailout negotiations even started. A national debt of six times total tax revenue. Greece needed to refinance €54 billion in 2010. Greece was doomed. 

To just keep treating water, Greece alone would have needed transfer payments of €30+ billion per year, for many years. Transfer payments, not cheap loans. And that amount neither was possible, nor would it have been fair to the other European countries, some of which also needed help, and some of which would have had to foot the total bill.  

Meanwhile, Greece also was horribly bad at collecting taxes.   
Percentage of GDP collected in taxes, 2004-2007 (OECD numbers, pre-crisis years), including social security contributions:  
Italy - 39.3%, 39.1%, 40.6%, 41.7%  
Germany - 33.9%, 33.9%, 34.5%, 34.9%    
Greece - 30.5%, 31.9%, 31.0%. 31.8%  
Nobody would have been able to convince German taxpayers of the year 2010 that German taxes should go up further so that Greek taxes could continue to stay lower than German taxes.  

Also, nobody would have been able to convince retired Germans of the year 2010 that the already low German state pensions should be cut further so that average Greek state pensions could remain higher than average German state pensions. While true, this is slightly unfair to Greece because the social security systems are very different.

Congress has earmarked more funds but without the extra money it would have run out a few days ago in no small thanks to certain big businesses that have called dibs on those loans. In fact the SBA pdf literally showed that loans over $1 million had taken up 45% of the available funds that could have went to smaller firms.


Per the Financial Times:


&gt;Data from the SBA show that almost 45 per cent of the $349bn went to companies who were borrowing more than $1m. Just 17 per cent went to those applying for loans of less than $150k. On a volume basis, those small businesses accounted for 74 per cent of the funds’ recipients.

And there are plenty of loopholes in the legislation for big restaurant chains like Shake Shack too that fuck over smaller ones:


&gt;Under the terms, businesses that employ fewer than 500 people are eligible for loans, which will be forgiven if the borrower does not lay off workers or rehires them by June 30.

&gt;But a subsection of the legislation, under the heading “business concerns with more than 1 physical location,” states that certain types of businesses, including restaurant and hotel chains, with no more than 500 employees “per physical location” are also eligible.

Next to this guideline, it is also morally wrong. Healthcare costs us 10% of our GDP. Having doctors (public servants) earning €300k+ from our tax money would be shameful. You can have a very, very good life on €100k per year. €300k puts you in summer house, multiple cars and private flight territory. If you are paid by tax money that will make a lot of people angry.

4454,"&gt; What's up with all the bullshit? Do you think people on reddit can't read a graph? Italy has a higher %debt to GDP now than 1996.

Of course, because a *little* thing called the banking crisis happened in 2007, which caused state debt to spike for *all* European governments, north and south, east and west. But I expect people on reddit to have at least that minimum basic knowledge if they're willing to have an opinion about state debt, sovereign debt interest rates, and fiscal unions. Otherwise they would be making quite a fool of themselves, don't you think?

&gt;but you I think it's a ridiculous idea to essentially steal (through inflation) German savers money to reduce the Italian debt

First, most economists agree that it will not have a meaningful impact on inflation, because the ECB already has trouble reaching the inflation target now. There is no risk of excessive inflation in the EU, if anything we're risking deflation, which is much, much worse than inflation, which is why the ECB aims for a mild inflation target of 2%. Ask any economist.

They'll also tell you that that inflation is good, because it encourages enterprises and economic activity, while it discourages piling up money. So if anyone is worried about inflation, one solution: spend it. On yourself, on someone else, consumption, investment, doesn't matter: let it roll. Every buck you spend gives someone else the chance to work for it.

&gt;if there is no guarantee that the next Italian government won't just repeat the pattern of taking on unsustainable debt.
There has to be a fiscal union otherwise high inflation will just make both the south and the north uncompetitive in attracting industry. If you think that you got screwed over by your parents, then I think that you're barking up the wrong tree.

There is no pattern of taking on unsustainable debt. There just isn't, at least undisputably not since the 90s. And that's already a generation ago. Even the debt increases of the 70-80s are debateable in their opportunity costs, and they certainly weren't alone in employing those policies. So why punish Italians who live now for the fact that their parents voted for politicians who implemented policies that were about as commonly accepted as sensible as austerity is now, 50-40 years ago? They still have the debt to pay off. And they will pay it, like they did in the past. That will not change, with or without Eurobonds. So why do you think you are justified in punishing them twice for something they didn't do?

4511,"&gt;Some anarcho-communists (and collectivist anarchists as well) reject individualism and collectivism as illusory concepts.[119] They argue that individuals sacrificing themselves for the ""greater"", or being ruled by the ""community"" or ""society"", is not possible because society is composed of individuals rather than being a cohesive unit separate from the individual, and argue that collective control over the individual is tyrannical and thus antithetical to anarchism.[120] Others, such as Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt, argue that: ""The anarchists did not [...] identify freedom with the right of everybody to do exactly what one pleased but with a social order in which collective effort and responsibilities—that is to say, obligations—would provide the material basis and social nexus in which individual freedom could exist."" They argued that ""genuine freedom and individuality could only exist in a free society"" and that in contrast to ""misanthropic bourgeois individualism"" anarchism was based in ""a deep love of freedom, understood as a social product, a deep respect for human rights, a profound celebration of humankind and its potential and a commitment to a form of society where a 'true individuality' was irrevocably linked to 'the highest communist socieability'"".[31][121]

4554,"&gt;Its paywalled, but from what i gathered, Serbia was cleared of anything relating to Srebrenica, so it wasn't a genocidal regime, just a dictatorship

OK, I will quote you some bits:

&gt;Nonetheless, it faulted Serbia, saying it “could and should” have prevented the genocide and, in its aftermath, should have punished the Bosnian Serbs who systematically killed close to 8,000 men and boys in July 1995.

&gt;Judge Rosalyn Higgins, the court’s president, read the ruling, which described the close ties between Serbia and the Bosnian Serb forces. It said that the leaders in Belgrade, and President Slobodan Milosevic above all, “were fully aware of the deep-seated hatred which reigned between the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslims in the Srebrenica region,” and that massacres were likely to occur. Yet the Serbs did nothing to avert atrocities or prevent the killings, “claiming they were powerless, which hardly tallies with their known influence” over the Bosnian Serb forces, the ruling concluded.

&gt;Serbia thereby violated the United Nations Convention on Genocide to which it is a party, the ruling found. The ruling, Judge Higgins noted, is binding and final, without appeal. Failing to arrest and hand over the Bosnian Serb military commander, Ratko Mladic, was a further violation, the court said.

&gt;Im pretty sure the Estonian Home Guard is in fact, Estonian. Same as the Estonian Auxillary police.

I'm not sure what you are trying to convey with this. The Omakaitse (loosely translated as ""Home Guard"") was indeed the Estonian Auxiliary Police.

&gt;They were Nazis that were willingly under Nazi control

Flat out lies, even though I provided you a source that clearly stated otherwise.

&gt;Sure, thats why the Estonian auxillary police and Estonian Home Guard were committing crimes

There were local collaborators everywhere, how do you not get that???

&gt;Yes, then the Nazis came, and you started collaborating and got occupied to stop being genocidal against the Jewish and Slavic population.

But all German-occupied countries had collaborators...

&gt;we aren't discussing the Soviets here, but what your country did in WW2.

Following your logic, I can argue that the Baltic states have not been independent for long enough to be considered as such, and this should be reviewed.

&gt; This is only catering to Russian imperialism. Are you really claiming that Russia has the right to decide for other nations?

Russia does not have the right to decide for other nations. But Russia has the right to warn about the consequences. Further, the countries make their own decisions whether to take into account Russia's warning or ignore them. As practice showed, ignoring the strategic interests of your neighbors leads to sad consequences. Again, these strategic interests are determined by Putin and his team. How much these actions were justified, we will find out in the future.

It will take a very long time, and you will make a shitload of money on interest -on top of keeping your export market and being able to dictate an entire country's policy.

I know one old guy left a string of debts from his efforts to get into business in the 90s. Another family friend had a successful franchise selling motorbikes and other businesses which unravelled after his death the business probably being worth about the same amount as the debt - which can be inherited here. Back then there was no greed as people got what they were given, the same car, the same furniture, a summer cottage.

4728,"&gt;i would guess that next year tourism will be above average.

While I'd hazard there is a good chance that most of the economy will be moving almost normally by then, I'm quite unsure about tourism.

Testing, tracing and care needs to get very good to be able to simply lift travel restrictions. And even then I think it's much more likely that some restrictions will be left in place (for example mandatory tests and short quarantines). On top of that you can add simple reluctance to travel in light of constant risk of pandemic reigniting, especially in travel hubs/destinations...

I just don't see tourism recovering until the pandemic is actually contained by herd immunity. Which means either mass deployment of successful vaccine or all containment failing and everybody getting through it...

I think the Cold War probably destroyed a lot of that, and then Reagan gave it a neoliberal death blow. That's why Bernie Sanders' campaign was so interesting to me, it was the rebirth of FDR's politics.

Three things. High inflation eating in borrowing costs, their central bank not buying treasuries and interest rates have been falling for the past 50 years way before Euro(less investment more lending). Also Italy had actual growth that helped service the debt.

So capitalism doesn't have any bad points? Gas companies continuing to add lead to gasoline for decades [despite knowing it was extremely toxic](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/secret-history-lead/) to maintain profits for example, is that not something bad in your book?

But like, I'm not saying incidents like these make capitalism bad as a whole. They don't. There are nuances to all things. A company donating to charity just to increase their marketing and then spending magnitudes more boasting about it is both good and bad at the same time. 

Communism is the same. There are good and bad things about it. Romania used to be pretty much a big farmland. Communism industrialized it quickly. The reason we have such high home ownership is because of communism. We don't have the type of workplace inequality that exists in the west. These are good things. 

At the same time, it was also a terribly oppressive system. It robbed a lot of wealth from people, it often concentrated that wealth in the hands of the leader and certain party members, it silenced intellectuals and it created Securitate (our KGB) to spy on Romanian citizens. These are bad things.

Eurobonds are a complete non-starter, they are *never* going to happen. Something like the ESM with a clear upper boundry but less restrictions? Reasonable.

1) COVID-19 is here to stay. Like it or not

2) Death &amp; risk is a personal choice. Living your life with courage &amp; hope is something that should be praised, not blamed. Modern times pushed death out of the subjects of the day, but I prefer a more inclusive way of thinking about death. 

3) Social distancing measures (i.e. physical distancing, in fact) were taken because health systems were not designed to deal with a pandemic. A pandemic like this was foreseen, and states should have prepared, but instead officials scratched their butts as usual. This is a failure of these systems.

Instead, we ended up with this, like in medieval times. I only hope that a new Newton is already born and builds up a new theory, or that a new Boccaccio is writing as we speak his Decamerone.

Note that the state is imposing such measures, but it doesn't want to pay the price. The poor and vulnerable will pay it, as usual.

4) Pandemics were and pandemics will be. When death was more acceptable, throughout our history in fact, we wouldn't care, and we won't be doing what are you doing here. We would continue with our lives.

5) I found it healthy to not trust your govt and show them the middle finger.  

Mother should I trust the government? / Mother will they put me in the firing mine?/ Or is it just a waste of time?

What is the establishment of a “communist society, namely a socioeconomic order?”

I know the utopian imaginations of a Star Trek society. They are irrelevant to the fact that communism wants to change and control society to reach that stage.

It’s like you tell me in order to be truly free I have to become a martyr and blow myself up. Just because the intended goal is utopian doesn’t mean that the method getting there works or is morally justifiable.

Communism is a collectivist ideology.

5138,"It doesn't matter in any case if so much of their industry is privatised. They're an explicitly socialist government, implementing explicitly pro worker laws, which was originally elected on the back of its socialist credentials. It's a country transitioning to socialism.

Regardless, socialism is when there is worker control over the means of production, as opposed to capital control over the means of production. Venezuela is 'socialist', because while it hasn't outright expropriated the entirety of the means of production, it has effectively neutered capital by introducing price controls, capital controls, threats of expropriations, and poor and arbitrary rule of law to make it so that capital no longer controls the means of production, whilst still technically owning it on paper. If you can't set the price for the goods you create, if you can't move your capital, and if you can't shut down your means of production due to threats that the government will expropriate it if you do (which is well documented in the Venezuelan case), there is no longer capital control over the means of production.

So yeah, maybe most of the means of production are, on paper, still owned by capital. But with the restrictions on them, they're no longer controlled by capital. They're held in trust by the vanguard party on behalf of the proletariat. It's not a society that has achieved full socialism, but it's definitely a socialist society.

They were puppets enough or at least they sympathized with them, which was dangerous enough in Cold War geopolitics...

5199,"&gt; The European Union seems helpless, even complicit, as authoritarian-minded governments cite the pandemic to consolidate their power.

&gt; BRUSSELS — Authoritarian-minded leaders around the world have used the coronavirus emergency to consolidate power. In Europe, the governments of Poland and Hungary have done that and more. They have managed to turn the crisis into a windfall and punish their political opponents, too.

&gt; In a hasty effort to show that it was doing something to help during the virus crisis, the European Union repurposed 37 billion euros — about $40 billion — in structural aid funds, designed to help newer and poorer members, for virus aid. The result: Hungary and Poland each got considerably more money than virus-ravaged Italy or Spain.

&gt; Rather than punish two governments that have challenged the democratic values at the heart of the European project, the warped allocation of the money, with little oversight or requirement to respect the rule of law, looked more like a reward.

&gt; It raised fresh questions about the European Union’s reluctance to criticize two governments that continue to flout the European standards of democracy and rule of law.

&gt; Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary is exercising emergency powers granted to him by the Parliament he dominates to deny opposition mayors sizable tax receipts in the name of new virus funding controlled by the central government.

&gt; Poland’s government, led by the Law and Justice Party of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is planning to go ahead with presidential elections on May 10, despite a virus lockdown that prevents opposition candidates from campaigning effectively. The government is pushing a bill to require all 30 million or so votes to be cast by postal ballot, which the postal union says is absurd and impossible.

&gt; At the same time, Poland’s government is pushing ahead with changes to the courts, creating a chamber of “extraordinary control” that will be charged with certifying the elections. Nor is it clear if Warsaw will bow to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the highest in the European Union, ordering it to suspend a new “disciplinary chamber” of the Supreme Court.

&gt; Last Friday, the European Parliament passed a resolution criticizing the activities of both governments during the coronavirus crisis as “totally incompatible with European values.”

&gt; Not for the first time, Parliament called on the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, and the national government leaders who gather as the European Council to revive a sanctions procedure that could result in both countries losing their voting rights.

&gt; But the resolution is effectively toothless, and sanctions require unanimity, with Poland and Hungary each promising to veto sanctions aimed at the other.

&gt; Instead, the commission has provided them even more money.

&gt; According to the European Stability Initiative, a research institute, Italy got €2.3 billion, while Hungary, with a sixth of its population and fewer virus cases, got €5.6 billion — 3.9 percent of its gross domestic product. Poland got €7.4 billion.

&gt; Gerald Knaus, a founder of the group and a critic of undemocratic politics in Hungary and Poland, said it was an absurd distortion that should lead to “a wake-up call’’ for Brussels.

&gt; While the commission admitted that this was not “an optimal allocation,” Mr. Knaus said that “it was, however, a perfect deal for Viktor Orban,” who only three days before had claimed that the European Union had “done nothing” for Hungary during the crisis.

&gt; The irony, Mr. Knaus said, was that the funds were released the very day, March 30, that the Hungarian Parliament, citing the virus, gave Mr. Orban the right to rule indefinitely by decree.

&gt; Mr. Orban has since taken over a publicly controlled company and declared land used by a Samsung factory to be a “special economic zone” — taking away its tax receipts, which provided one-third of the municipal budget to a town, Göd, run by the opposition, and giving them to the Pest County Council, where his party has the majority.

&gt; Mr. Orban also suspended parking fees and put motor-vehicle taxes into a virus fund, said R. Daniel Kelemen, a professor of political science and law at Rutgers University. “He’s finding ways to punish the opposition,” Mr. Kelemen said.

&gt; “The commission has done nothing meaningful to stand up to Orban but has helped him,” Mr. Kelemen said, while the council of heads of state and government has not wanted to confront one of its own. “The E.U. provides money without accountability,” he said.

&gt; The European Union, which is traditionally reluctant to interfere in domestic politics, must begin to add conditions to its massive structural aid funds, Mr. Knaus said. Those should include respect for democracy, the rule of law and the European Court of Justice, he said, noting that even the Marshall Plan, designed by Washington to help rebuild Europe after World War II, had political conditions attached.

&gt; Mr. Kelemen agrees, noting that Hungary is no longer characterized as a full democracy by groups like Freedom House, while Mr. Orban creates what he calls an “illiberal’’ state.

&gt; Peter Kreko, director of Political Capital, a Budapest research institution, said that so far the government has been

&gt; careful not do anything under the emergency decree that it could not have done otherwise. “But what has been done so far has been pretty horrible,” he said.

&gt; Hungary’s justice minister, Judit Varga, has accused Brussels of double standards. “They are condemning us on the basis of false accusations,’’  she told the Hungarian news agency MTI, pointing out that Parliament continues to remain in session.

&gt; But there is little doubt that Mr. Orban’s tactics have served as a model for Poland’s Mr. Kaczynski.

&gt; Law and Justice has pushed a similar narrative, saying that Warsaw has been left to fend for itself because European institutions are helpless, no aid is forthcoming and European “solidarity” is a myth.

&gt; Mr. Kaczynski told the newspaper Gazeta Polska that the pandemic had exposed “the weakness of the European Union” and the need for reform, proving “the crucial significance of nation states,” whose “internal affairs should not be interfered with.”

&gt; The government insists the election will go ahead despite the lockdown.

&gt; President Andrzej Duda, backed by Law and Justice, has had a prominent role in the virus response and holds a significant lead over five challengers, hovering close to the 50 percent needed to win in the first round.

&gt; With large public demonstrations impossible, Parliament is also pushing ahead bills restricting abortion and sex education, which caused huge protests in the past.

&gt; “It’s absolutely impossible to organize a fair postal voting in the time frame we have,” said Jan Grabiec, spokesman for Civic Platform, the main opposition party. “The government is setting up an election that will most likely be questioned by state and European authorities.”

&gt; Judge Sylwester Marciniak, head of the National Electoral Commission, warned against last-minute changes to facilitate postal elections.

&gt; His predecessor, Judge Wojciech Hermelinski, was more explicit.

&gt; “It’s against all rules,” he told the broadcaster TVN24. “Those elections will not be universal, equal, anonymous. They will have no chance of being recognized not only in the country, but mainly by international organizations.”

&gt; But given the virus, Mr. Kaczynski told state-run Polish Radio that this would be the only way to hold safe elections. He himself suggested that the ballot could not be postponed for a year, because by then Poland would be struggling with an economic crisis and Mr. Duda’s chances of winning would be slimmer.

You are also right that a text doesn't need to be true to be effective, but given the popularity and political impact of the book it was naturally heavily discussed in academic circles, and came under a lot of fire, but that fire didn't produce nearly enough actually reliable counter-publications that I know of to consider the book unreliable.
As you wrote, political bias puts a spin on people's words - which is not what I dispute at all as you interpret it; what I dispute is that being called a fascist-sympathizer in his later days means Solzhenitsyn's work about the Soviets loses in reliability. On the same argument the Russian government praising something that puts their own president in a bad light for being part of the regime that is criticised in that work holds value when it comes to the work itself - if it'd be as (publicly known) unreliable as claimed that move could also be easily used by enemies of the regime to point out it's incompetence and thus should be mentioned since it hasn't that I know of.

All in all I agree that my second comment could have been given more thought, but I am not in a position of being able to properly search for a variety of sources at the moment and since the accusations made are completely sourceless and biased, I don't feel the need that a completely backed response is worth the time or  effort.

5302,"Ok so firstly I would like to remind you that countries contributions to the EU are literally pennies.

For example:

&gt;In 2018 the UK made an estimated gross contribution (after the rebate) of £13.2 billion. The UK received £4.3 billion of public sector receipts from the EU, so the UK’s net public sector contribution to the EU was an estimated £8.9 billion.

The GDP for the UK in 2018 was £2.11 trillion. That is 0.0043 of that trillion they paid in. Don't even start me on Germany or other contributors. £8.9 sounds like alot but it is not in the grand scheme of things.

Now on to the second point. How do countries make their money in the EU? Well let me tell you it's in Trade. It's in investments to the EU to build a road say in Hungary where produce can be transported to France for example increasing trade. The point im making here is the more you invest the more you get back. If you don't want to invest more thats fine but you won't grow as fast either. So imo the extra pennies you pay are worth it. Look at it this way you do t have to invest/give any of that to the UK anymore.

Lastly onto the double budget increase. You are in a global economic meltdown at the moment due to a pandemic. They are asking for budget to ensure this very recession and outbreak can be handled in the future. Again your choice. Either as some other poster mentioned you do it alone with no help (we can see exactly how well that is working out - UK I'm looking at you) or you can pay in to the EU that has the power and resources it needs to provide its members to tools to fight such a thing in the future and a system to centrally manage it. This pandemic has clearly shown that no country can do this alone effectively and at the time of writing this the EU does not habe the tools or authority to sort out a situation like this in the future. So I ask you what is your risk appetite?

On a personal note I care about EU citizens. While I don't live in Europe any more that extra €1.50 a week I would pay for all the above is worth it.

Federalism of budgets is almost always a extra layer of unneccesary bureaucracy. You can see this in most federal systems. Instead of the regulars goverment only 8 out of 10 dollars find their way to the actual targets now it'll be 6 out of 10. And because it's governed by people that will not understand the places they are making decisions about you can easily make that 5 out of 10.



Federalism is literally the way back to the old europe with wars. Youll have the south forming as a block and outvoting the fiscal sensible countries. Effectively ensuring bad policies and seriuosly negligent governance.

The old regime eventually would be restored, probably under a military junta. 

Lenins political brilliance was that to know exactly when to show up, and show power, to grab the raging russian mass, and forcefully guide them to his goal. 
Today, his legacy is greatly influenced by Stalin's later cult of Lenin, becouse he derived his legitimacy from Lenin. There was a slogen used under Stalin: ""Stalin -  Lenin today"" And people thought that logically meant ""Lenin - Stalin yesterday"" But that was not true. There was a big difference between Lenin and Stalin. Peope often forget the years between the revolution and Stalin, but one is not come instantly, and only from the other.

Mussolini was an ex socialist and had a syndicalist minister from 1925-1932 and Hitler was inspired off of Oswald Spengler's Prussian Socialism. Oswald Mosley was an ex socialist as well. The idea Trump is even close to a fascist is laughable, as the Doctrine of Fascism calls for things such as a highly progressive income tax, something most libertarian capitalists don't support. Of course it isn't economically socialist, but to call it something capitalists would love is pretty silly imo.


3/4 of the economy was state owned under Mussolini along with banking, and the social safety net was expanded along with a lot of infrastructure and public education expansion. Under Hitler the corporate tax was raised from 20%-50%, the top income tax bracket was raised, and speculation on many national goods were banned. It was made harder to get involved with the stock market, and many things such as housing were subsidized. Hitler also made it so that public servants could not own stock, and they could not serve as apart of a private business while in office. Pensions were cut for the aristocracy, while for veterans and others they were raised. Hitler also limited dividend payouts to 6% of profit meaning businesses either invested, gave employees bonuses or bought bonds None of this sounds like something your average libertarian rightist would advocate for.

5424,"Reading this actually hurts. 

Okay, let's take some definitions:

Socialism = ""a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole""

Limited definition imo, and quite vague. But even in this one there's quite a strong implication of democratic ownership, and not a mention of state, let alone a strong one.

Communism = ""a philosophical, social, political, economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.""

quite a usual one, with all its utopian talk. Note how it says ""absence of state"" and ""common ownership"".

Totalitarianism = ""a political system or a form of government that prohibits opposition parties, restricts individual opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high degree of control over public and private life. It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of authoritarianism. In totalitarian states, political power has often been held by autocrats who employ all-encompassing campaigns in which propaganda is broadcast by state-controlled mass media.""

or

""a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state""

Now you might say that in practice most Leninist states were quite far from what Marx wrote about (hehe, no true communism, hehe)... but totalitarianism is very much a strict word to the point where there are fascists who do not qualify for the term.

Please.

&gt; ut archival evidence has led Vladimir Tismaneanu to conclude that ""Ana Pauker's downfall did not occur merely, or even primarily, because of Gheorghiu-Dej's skillful maneuvering—as some Romanian novels published in the 1980s would have us believe—but foremost because of Stalin's decision to initiate a major political purge in Romania.""

Tismaneanu is one of the top historians on communist history.

&gt; . One of the few communists leaders here who tried to loosen up things with this prison and with detainees in general was our prime-minister at the time, Ana Pauker.

Really? Because Experimentul Pitesti was between 1949-1952. 

There were 3 party members that were removed from power: Ana Pauker, Vasile Luca and Teohari Georgescu. 

Teohari Georgescu was the Minister of Interior and as such he was in charge with prisons. 

They all spent copious amounts of time in Moscow, they were all stalinists, they had all participated in creating the repressive regime.

They were all complicit at one level or another.

The first time the regime started to be less full blown oppressive with the closure of labour camps like Periprava, political prisons like Gherla was in 1966 when Dej was replaced by Ceausescu.",Posh Crimea,/r/europe/comments/g655r2/illustration_of_prisoners_torturing_each_other/fo865rt/,Low_discrepancy,1587590596
5527,"Imagining you are asking what can be done about italy itself rather than the specific third crisis in a row developing in Italy in less than 12 years I'm gonna say: at this point? we still have an awful lot of private wealth, but we've got one single shot at it, and this capital is shrinking inexorably as years pass by floating in water that's getting more and more hotter.

hence, the solution? the biggest wealth tax you can think of, but it needs not to be wasted on paying back the debt, it would be moronic doing so, but on investing on new state owned enterprises on both the traditional and emerging key sectors, infrastructures, research and education, also in rebulding the dyplomatic double faced politics we had and that made us grow till the fall of the ussr and that disappeared with the polarization of the western world. italy is the smallest amongst the big powers and the biggests of the small powers (fow now at least), our political weight is to be put accordingly in each different scenario, and we did effectively so until 25 years ago.

as for this matter, from my limited understandings, I would leverage on a new axis with similar stakeholders such as ourself in this age of rotting globalization. Maybe trying getting france once again with us like with did with the creation of the euro to contain germany, rebulding a strong alliance with the US like poland did in the east, trying to install a convenient double faced relationship with china as we did with the ussr with our communist party

But this is just rampant and mosly useless speculation, with automatization, the rise of africa, declining western population, the unstoppable process of ever increasing wealth and income inequality running in the old economic world it's impossible thinking in terms of international alliances and common targets for just than a few years

Gettin back to the first paragraph, just to achive the conditions pointing to the mere possibility of rolling out such a plan of economic investments is a miracle at this historical moment. the nation is currently being torn apart due to intenal and external factors, many of which we have no control on and that were inevitable also. it will get better once it'll get worse i think, and many others believe in this phrase, im sure. the point is, seems like the worse has finally arrived and as such the need of a turning point. if not, i expect a general impoverishment that will subsequently result in a final economic balkanization and polarization of our land, for the hands of whose profiteers is yet unknown

The biggest problem is the lack of unity and common will in our own population. The cracks are both regionals and generationals. Xenophilia is rampant too, that's a consolidated charateristic of ours dating back to centuries.  Finally, Italiy has always been a strongly  other-directed country, this is another aspect to take into consideration.  The way our politics went is a reflection, rather than the cause, of all of this. I just shake my head interally when someone suggest that we just need to get better politicians.

In between this mess though, scattered, dispersed and without holding any substatial power, and even prevented from achieving it, we have a considerable census of citizens which are probably the most skilled and intelligent in the world.

5533,"I think you're confusing Liberals and ""Libertarians"" from the US.

Liberals are slightly progressive, gun-hating economic centrists that think socialism is far-left and Communists are dangerous extremists without really understanding how many branches of Communism there are and why it's failed in the past - Hint: Marxist-Leninism only leads to State Capitalist dictatorships, because the State is only a tool of oppression.

Liberals tend to like Neo-Liberal states, which are the majority of European Union states. They get to be progressive, but don't seem to mind the reduction in civil rights that their governments try to push (See the EU's attempts to regulate the Internet and heightened monitoring of speech by law enforcement (in the UK at least)).
They don't really believe in any significant political change because they're usually bougie members of the middle class and haven't experienced the struggle of the working class. They get to virtue signal on social media, but they're happy with ignoring the innately oppressive nature of Capitalism.

If anything, Liberals are a bigger obstacle for the Left than a Centrist. Liberal SJWs claim to be on the Left, but they'll only push identity politics with unreasonable zeal (And I'm saying this as part of the LGBT+ community) and deplatform those with differing opinions (Deplatforming Fascists is good, but not every conservative is a Nazi). They make the Left look intolerant and unapproachable and push Centrists further towards the cultural Right, which makes it harder to help them see the real problems in society.

tl;dr - A Liberal likes the state, hates violence, is mildly progressive and lacks class consciousness. A US ""Libertarian"" hates being told what to do by the state, but loves when the state tells other people what to do, loves the police, loves the military and hates Liberals (Libs).

5570,"&gt; Yes, I am sure that those companies are doing great in Eastern Europe, using cheap Eastern European labor, creating manual labor or service-based, dead-end jobs, while having their R&amp;D, corporate headquarters in Western Europe, paying taxes there, and providing cushy jobs for Western Europeans. If they can’t find someone to do a more intricate, skilled-based job, they can just ~~brain-drain~~ import them from Eastern Europe so that that Eastern European can live there, pay taxes there, and work for a company that predominately benefits the Western European country now and in the future. That was my point

What does this thing have to do with what you said?? Your words exactly:"" Fast forward a couple years when communism fell, and their gigantic companies pillaged everything in Eastern Europe"". You can reread my argument if you need to and maybe not move the goalpost.

&gt; LOL, politicians are brain-draining their own country? What more could an Eastern European country do to prevent flight of their educated, innovative youth, other than, as I’ve mentioned numerous times, PROTECTIONISM?

Poland literally has the sixth largest erasum student population in the EU. It seems its kinda popular with students.

&gt; Could you imagine South Koreas (who Poland is next to on the chart) going to work in Japan either as cheap labor or young, urban, professionals and working for the benefit of Japan? That’s the same kind of dynamic as here. Except, I’m no expert on Korean-Japanese relations but I’m pretty sure Japan never explicitly stated that they wanted to exterminate all South Koreans. 

Firstly, Poland's gdp per capita is less than that of South korea's, and secondly Japan has a very strict immigration policy so it's not comparable.

&gt; They are doing what they were meant to do — build Eastern Europe into a middle-income kind of society from which you can plunder cheap labor and brain-drain; when you need it. 

So eu funds are building countries in a middle-income society, and at the same time that causes them to have low wages?? This is truly contradicting .

&gt; Eastern Europe did not receive the same deal that Western Europe received post-WWII, yet Western European freeloaders seem to believe we owe them eternal gratitude for their completely altruistic EU funds. 

In today's money the total amount of money West Germany got from the marshall plan would be around 22 billion dollars. That number isn't even close to the number that Poland got from EU funds through 2014-2018 - 69 billion euros.

&gt; Macron is in the news saying this almost every day. It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that Poland and Hungary are parasites who “net recipients reeeeee” the European Union and are too stupid to figure out democracy. Because it’s only democracy when the guys I want are voted in, right? 

I highly doubt macron is talking about Hungary and Poland every day. And why then doesn't macron say that the Netherlands isn't democratic when exactly they are blocking eurobonds?

&gt; Don’t care. That argument does nothing for me in the slightest. I’m sure that they send their one-fourth-of-minimum-wage-after-deductions-for-the-privilege-of-working-in-Western-Europe wages back to Eastern Europe. My question is, que bono? [Who’s benefiting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8eyzzq/just_18_of_poles_in_the_netherlands_on_welfare/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb) Their welfare societies and their societies’ as a whole or Eastern Europe with the shitty wages that are sent back? 

Wait, are you saying that polish workers are funding the welfare system of the Netherlands, because that wouldn't make sense, considering you believe that polish people are there to work low wage jobs, and that wouldn't create money for the government?

&gt; They could and they should go to the US and Canada. At least those countries aren’t going to put them in work camps and treat them like the lowest filth ever seen on God’s green earth. Also, you get the added benefit of not working for the benefit of countries like the Netherlands or Germany. 

Are polish people working in ""work camps"" in the Netherlands and Germany? And why wouldn't a polish person not be working for the benefit of the US?

nobody knows when or if we will see a vaccine, but we are talking years. we can all think of viruses for which a vaccine was never found.


the conclusion, the painful conclusion, is to slowly reopen society in order to produce a controlled transmission of the virus. the youngest are back in school, small shops are open again, people are outside and traffic is returning.


we have a capacity of about a thousand ventilators in danish hospitals, iirc, with less than a tenth in use. that factor will ultimately decide how much to open and how much to close down over time.

The public sees Italy as a country that spends more than it earns, where people retire many years earlier than in The Netherlands. In the public discussion in The Netherlands I am missing the Italian point of view. A major part of this discussion is being held in 2 late nights shows (Jinek and Op1).

That number has been refuted countless time and do you have any idea how many people die every single year because the great invisible hand of the market doesn't give a shit about them? 

20 million. 

20 million people die every year of hunger, lack of clean water and lack of medicine for preventable diseases. Every 5 years capitalism kills more than ""communism"" killed in over a hundred years. And that doesn't even include wars. The 100 million number includes wars socialist or supposedly socialist countries waged, yet when a capitalist country invades another country or supports a fascist coup because of oil or because the people democratically elected a socialist, that doesn't count towards capitalism deaths? Sounds biased.

&gt;Pol Pot

Pol Pot was not a communist. As he admitted himself, he was an ultra-nationalist. He assumed communism and allied himself with China and Vietnam because he needed their support in his endeavour to create a Khmer nation. His rule was extremely xenophobic and saw ethnic cleansings through deportation and murder. When his communist allies turned against him, he dissolved his communist party and allied himself with the west.

5676,"&gt; I wonder what USSR would become if he lived at least a decade longer.

Here's an interview of Stephen Kotkin, professor of history at Princeton University.

He explains, that some time after the revolution, the bolsheviks had managed to establish collectivism in the Russian cities. But the Russian countryside was still running on capitalism. The bolsheviks didn't know what to do. They wanted to force collectivism on the countryside, too, but didn't know how. There were 120 million peasants, much more than people in the urban areas under their control.

If they would try coerce the countryside into collectivism, either they will lose the fight and thus lose the communist revolution. Or even if they win, they will end up killing so many farmers and destabilizing the system, causing large famines and suffering, they predicted. They saw no solution.

But Stalin acted anyway, killed shitloads of farmers anyway, and it actually caused much larger famines, even more suffering, than the other bolsheviks had been afraid of. 5-7 million people die of hunger, 50-70 million are malnourished. It ended up worse than they had feared. Stalin just had the stomach to do it all anyway, not caring about human lives, only the ideology.

5835,"Our failure to grapple with the events at the Jasenovac and broader actions of Ustasha is our biggest collective failure as a nation.

To provide you a flavour of what I mean, here is the lead of the [Croatian Wikipedia article on Jasenovac concentration camp](https://hr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sabirni_logor_Jasenovac&amp;oldid=5503189).

&gt; Collection camp^1 Jasenovac was the biggest collection and labour camp in Independent State of Croatia, which continued to substantially function during Yugoslavian times. The collection camps were founded as places  of imprisonment, forced labour, and murder of a large number of Serbs, Romani and Croats (opponents of Ustasha, and after the war of communist, regime^2).
&gt;     
&gt; Collection camps came to be as a result of racial and national exclusions in the Independent State of Croatia which on the 10th of April 1941, under guise and direct influence of Nazi Germany, proclaimed Ustasha homeland organisation (the very same day that German army entered Zagreb^3).

&gt; During the decades of the communist government in Croatia there was no scientific research conducted in the Collection camp Jasenovac; Franjo Tuđman^4, as the only historian who attempted to speak scientifically about this topic, ended up in prison. Instead of science, propaganda was created, which attempted to, by the means of creating the 'Myth of Jasenovac' and ballooning the number of victims^5, prevent awakening of Croatian nationalism, as it was the objectively the biggest threat to the continual survival of Yugoslavian state.

This is intentionally a close translation. As literally translated as possible. If you feel the prose is quite tortured, it is like so in the original as well.

My comments

1. This is intentional and obvious refusal to use the more common and widely accepted Croatian term 'koncentracijski kamp', equivalent of the English term 'concentration camp'.
2. Attempt to conflate and equalise Ustasha atrocities with communist Yugoslavia.
3. Shirking the responsibility for the policy.
4. First president of modern Croatia.

5901,"Bullshit. You either don’t know your history or deliberately misleading. 


&gt; In the century before World War II, U.S. rulers had already piled up a record of violent intervention in various countries, starting with the war of aggression against Mexico ending in 1848 that led to the annexation of almost half of Mexico's territory. U.S. expan­sionists then wiped out the last resistant Native American nations and closed the frontier. Some years later, in 1899-1903, they launched a bloody and protracted war of conquest in the Philip­pines. U.S. expeditionary forces intervened in China along with other Western armies to suppress the Boxer Rebellion and keep the Chinese under the heel of European and North American colonial­ists. U.S. marines invaded and occupied Nicaragua in 1912 and again in 1926-1933, Cuba in 1898-1902, Mexico in 1914 and 1916, Panama in 1903-1914, Haiti in 1915-1934, and Honduras six time between 1911 and 1925. So it was not an altogether unprecedented step when the United States joined other capitalist nations in an invasion of revolutionary Russia in 1918.


&gt; Years before the Russian Revolution, U.S. officials were taking repressive measures at home against syndicalists, anarchists, socialists, and communists who sought, in the words of one offi­cial, to ""reduce all economic classes to one dismal level."" When revolutionary workers, under the leadership of Lenin's Bolshevik party, seized state power in Russia in 1917, some American labor organizations offered expressions of solidarity. But among the moneyed classes of this and other capitalist nations the fear was palpable. The plutocracy's worst nightmare was coming true: here was a successful socialist revolution by the unlettered and unwashed masses against the natural leaders of society, the per­sons of talent and property. Unless drastic measures were taken, might not other countries follow suit?


&gt; Beginning in August 1918, fourteen capitalist nations, includ­ing the United States, Great Britain, France, and Japan, invaded Soviet Russia in an attempt to overthrow the Bolshevik govern­ment. In addition to using their own troops, they provided aid to the reactionary pro-czarist White Guard armies. To justify their action, Western leaders initially announced that the intervention was an attempt to keep Russia in the war against Germany. But the World War ended shortly after the invasion, yet the allies con­tinued in their military campaign against the Bolshevik government for almost another two years. Western rulers also announced that the invasion was an attempt to rescue Czech prisoners-of-war marooned inside Russia. But the plight of the Czech prisoners developed well after the decision to intervene had been contemplated and was seized upon more as an after-the-fact excuse, a rather lame one at that.


&gt; In truth, the allied leaders intervened in revolutionary Russia for the same reason conservative rulers have intervened in revo­lutionary conflicts before and since: to protect the existing social order. Recall how various European monarchs colluded against the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century. All the bitter rivalries that plagued the courts of Europe weighed less than the aristocracy's shared interest in class survival. Recall also, almost a century later in 1871, how Bismarck mobilized the same French army he had just defeated so that it could be used by the French ruling class against the revolutionary workers of the Paris Commune.

5979,"&gt; The President of the Balearic Islands, Francina Armengol, has received in recent days two hundred letters from German investors demanding that she facilitate the immediate return of the European country's citizens to their second homes on the islands. In the letters, the German owners consider that the difficulties of access to these properties, which are expected to continue after the state of emergency ends, represent ""a violation of the right to property"", and threaten to seek other investment opportunities.

&gt; Regional government sources confirm that around 200 letters with very similar content have been received in recent days. The senders are real estate entrepreneurs, owners of villas and landlords of properties on the islands who are urging the Balearic Government to make the archipelago accessible to foreign owners ""immediately after"" the state of alarm has ended. The president, Socialist Francina Armengol, said after the video conference of presidents last Sunday that she had called on the state to keep the islands' ports and airports closed for as long as possible to ensure the health situation of the community. In fact, international flights are restricted to a maximum and there are only a couple of departures to German cities a few days a week.

&gt; ""Tourists come and go, and you can certainly do without tourists for a year because they will be back. However, if you scare off investors they won't come back soon,"" warn the entrepreneurs in some of the letters, where they recall the jobs they have helped to create in the luxury real estate and leisure sector. They chose Mallorca to invest because it is ""a safe environment"" although after the declaration of the state of alarm they say they have ""considerable doubts about the rule of law and its autonomous regions. These investors demand that the state of alarm should not be extended beyond the 26th of April and that, once it is over, ""shops, restaurants, golf courses and marinas"" should be reopened.
Irreparable"" damage

&gt; The letters also censure the measures taken by the government to curb the pandemic and stress that better results have been achieved in Germany ""without taking such drastic measures against the population"". ""I do not understand that in Spain, when the pandemic has diminished sharply, especially in the Balearic Islands, people are even thinking of extending the state of alarm with economic and psychological consequences that are disproportionate to the benefit,"" say most of the letters, which insist that ""irreparable"" damage is being caused.

&gt; Sources from the regional government explain that all these letters are being responded to, recalling that the pandemic has forced all of Europe to take drastic measures, with restrictions that limit such basic rights as mobility and force ""significant personal sacrifices"". ""The citizens are assuming them with a commitment beyond any doubt, from the certainty that we are united by a purpose that is at the same time the priority that guides all the steps of the government that I have the honor to preside: saving lives,"" emphasizes Armengol in his response letter.

&gt; After the declaration of the state of alarm, says the president, work was done to ensure air and sea links to enable authorized mobility in this situation, so that German citizens with their first residence on the islands can, like any other resident, return to their homes. He said that future plans include ensuring that the return to activity will be done by guaranteeing the safety of people and preventing the spread of the virus. Last year, the Balearic Islands received four and a half million German visitors and around 18,000 German citizens have their residence established on the islands.
