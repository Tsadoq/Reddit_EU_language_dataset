28,"&gt; But there is no mainstream European religious ideology that considers that non believers are little more than animals.

And neither does mainstream islam. 

&gt;Why?

Cause radical christians are just as crazy as radical muslims. There just aren't many of them in Europe because most people here don't live in a situation that would pull them towards radical religious sects. 

&gt;The issue is, you're still for more immigration, you still block any laws that could help prevent more attacks, you stilk don't want to admit than a massive and unassimiled Muslim immigration is problematic way beyond the terror attacks.

We are okey with immigration *despite* islamic terrorism. Because that's only a small part of the discussion of immigration. You guys keep on saying ""just stop immigration"" as if that's an obvious, small, and easy fix to the problem. But it's a really big leap to take unless you already have plenty of other reasons for wanting to stop immigration (in many cases largely based in racism). 

We see and understand how big of a problem terrorism and violence in general is. But it's first off not something that is common with all muslims, or even many muslims. So dealing with it should be focusing on the actual cause of the problems, not all of Islam or all muslims.",Sverige,/r/europe/comments/jn11hk/religiously_inspired_terrorism_in_the_eu/gazq8bx/,Askeldr,1604398992

47,"&gt;Sensibility...in /r/europe concerning muslims?

I mean personally i think that saying that all muslims are terrorists is simply stupid. Yes, people are tired and exhausted; they are hurting and fed up - which i get. Absolutely. I too am sick and tired of that sort of bs happening. 

But again, i do not consider all muslims as enemies - those terrorist pigs are the enemy!

There are lots of muslims who just want to live their lives in peace and are shocked and appalled by those actions. 

But, unfortunately, it isnt as easy because they quoran does promote some questionable views, to say the least. Now you can say the same thing about every holy book and you wouldnt be wrong - but the problem, imo, is that we have imams preaching hatred and using the quoran to poison the minds of gullible people. 

This has to stop and i hope that governments across europe will take a firm stance. 
Same with individuals who have been conspicuous in the past - for example, the asshole in vienna who had been jailed for almost 2 years because he wanted to join isis. These individuals should be, imo, punished more severely. 

But again, the law is the law as it is at this moment.

&gt;Is this a dream? Or maybe you're going to turn around and claim ""millions of muslim terrorists were imported"" or something?

I mean i think both things can be true:

You can say that not all refugees are terrorists/rapists/etc, and you would be, of course, correct. 

At the same time you can also criticise that the vetting of people who wish to come to the EU is severly lacking, which is dangerous not only in the immediate future but also in the long run.

I'm not worried about my friends grassing me up for making a tasteless joke while playing a game of Cards Against Humanity, but a stranger in the street is liable to misinterpret any number of innocent utterances.

So either the bill is fairly safe and well-designed in that jokes and innocent, misinterpreted utterances can't be prosecuted under it, in which case it's fine for it to be applied to home settings, or it isn't, in which case it shouldn't even be applied to the street.

Not really.

&gt;exceedingly *stupid*

Nope.

&gt;degenerate

Nope, on the contrary it's quite civilized.

&gt;If you are able to contain someone, then there is no need to execute them

We aren't talking about ""containment"", we're talking about punishment.

&gt;violent urge

Death penalties take decades to be approved and finally gone through. It's the exact opposite of an urge, it's a calculated and decisive punishment.

&gt;Once someone is incarcerated, they are supposed to be in your care

If someone is incarcerated, that means they fundamentally did something heinous and wrong that warranted imprisonment in the first place. No one is under the obligation to care for them, they are being punished for their choices.

If they never committed a crime, then they would not be imprisoned in the first place, we reward civic responsibility in society, we punish those that attempt to do harm to society.

&gt;state violence

State violence is the only thing that separates society from chaos and order. State violence is the sole stabilizer of humanity.

&gt;Your views are abhorrent

One could argue that it's YOUR views that are abhorrent. Serial rapists, mass killers, terrorists, etc don't deserve a life of comfy state accommodations and no work for the rest of their decades long lives.

The problem is that everything that Christ tell us we should do is difficult and requires sacrifice. We have to give up our time and money to help others. We have to be kind to people that are cruel to us. We have do our best to rid our own lives of sin. People don't want to focus on themselves, its hard. So instead, Christians (and all people really) take the easy way out, and spend their time pointing at others and trying to fix them, because its easy. Trying to fix someone else doesn't take any real work, you just tell them they have to change, maybe call them some unkind names, then claim you did your part as a Christian. This way they don't have to ever look within themselves.

In the gospels, did Jesus go around criticizing sinners? Did he tell lawyers, or tax collectors, or any of the other immoral people in society they were bad? No, he didn't. In fact those are the people he was drawn to the most. The only people Jesus criticized were the religious people that used religion as a way of making themselves out to be better than others. He openly said multiple times that in order to go to heaven, you need to be better than those religious people. This implies that religious people that act this way are in fact bound for hell. Also look at Mathew 7:22. This is about the Christians today that behave like that. They go around spreading hatred in his name, and they will pay for their actions.

I genuinely hope you come to you're sense for your own sake. Remember, you are Christian, so the word of Christ should take precedent over everything else. Christ tells us to love others, and not to judge them. He doesn't say to ""only judge them if their bad"" like I've heard someone else here claim, he says don't judge anyone. The problem is when you judge people, you make them and everyone else hate you and whatever group you are claiming is the reason for judgement. You are turning millions of people away from God by behaving the way you do. I would imagine the price of tha would be steep.",,/r/europe/comments/jmhseq/polish_women_fighting_for_their_rights/gayxixs/,importshark7,1604374520

&gt;It aims to mobilise its supporters by motivating them with, for example, spectacular deadly attacks deep in Western territory (such as the November 2015 Paris attacks), to polarise by driving Muslim populations – particularly in the West – away from their governments, thus increasing the appeal of ISIL's self-proclaimed caliphate among them, and to: ""Eliminate neutral parties through either absorption or elimination"".[178][180] Journalist Rukmini Maria Callimachi also emphasises ISIL's interest in polarisation or in eliminating what it calls the ""grey zone"" between the black (non-Muslims) and white (ISIL).

Not so much. I guess [some religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jNcFfICVic) is involved, but people on the ground do mostly think in terms of strategy, even if it's a completely retarded strategy that will backfire.

&gt; Obviously the average supporter isn't concerned with global geopolitics, but they're being organized and activated by those who are.

Islamic terrorism is very fractured in Europe due to mass surveillance. It's not clear that they are being organised and activated, rather than springing up fairly naturally and finding bomb-making material online (which is actually fairly easy to do if you go down some rabbitholes).

And even if they were, the people in charge are the most devout of all; no matter how smart they are, they still believe ludicrous things about Islam.

769,"&gt;Islamic extremism is not exactly a huge problem within the US.  If you were a privately owned newspaper, would you run cartoons that would make you a huge target?  What private business would do that? 

I love how you're pretending that the whole Charlie Hebdo issue is barely talked about in American media and not a single major media is publishing a caricature because they just don't care. They're just terrified, freedom of speech is dead if you don't use it.

&gt;Additionally, so many French are going on about free speech and you fined/arrested some comedian (Diudienne?) for making Jewish/holocaust jokes, that's not free speech either.   

Agreed with that, I'm personally in favour of the American version of freedom of speech (the theory, not the practice of it that is a travesty in US media) so I find this shameful even if I don't like Dieudonné. 

&gt;France has lost half it's Jews to Israel because they didn't have the freedom of speech to walk outside while being visibly Jewish, did anyone even give a shit?

So 2 things are clear here: you've never been to France in any major city on a Friday, especially Paris to think Jews cannot walk with a kippah on the street in France. You should stop consuming Netanyahu's propaganda if you think half of French Jews left for Israel. At the height of the Israeli propaganda push around 5000 people were leaving for Israel, that's not even 1% of our Jewish population.

&gt;France is being very brave in confronting this extremism it allowed to fester, but fixating on the US does nothing to further that.

In 2019 the Ministry of Health was given 9.486 billion lei, which was almost double than the State Secretariat for Religions. I don't think spending on religion is what's eating our budget.

He was an atheist? Okay. He still continued the purging of Eastern Anatolia of Armenians. 

Oh, he said nice things about Gallipoli? That's nice. He still continued the purging of Eastern Anatolia of Armenians.

He has a statue in Australia? Guess what the entire world has - statues dedicated to the remembrance of the Armenian Genocide. And why is that? Because Ataturk assisted in the purging of Eastern Anatolia of Armenians in a Genocidal conquest.

Turkish Left learnt this very very late but they have learnt at last. That is why you don't hear much complaints about Hagia Sophia, or religious extremism etc. Erdogan will just play  the victim. So the Left just shuts up, talks about economy, and waits for the election.

However, when an outsider country starts attacking Erdogan, the whole country gets Ottoman flashbacks, and defends Erdogan instinctively. By politically attacking Erdogan, you are making sure of his re-election. Calming down and waiting is a much better response.

The same thing happened in 2019 Mayoral Election btw. The greatest thing about Imamoglu (the guy who snatched Istanbul from AKP) was that he was the calmest, the most peaceful guy.

1243,"&gt; It's ranked 92nd actually - and any analysis which concludes that the UK has less freedom of thought than Chad, Tajikistan or Poland is just laughable. It only shows how impossible it is to meaningfully measure the concept with numbers, and so falls back to completely inadequate metrics than can be 'scored' objectively. What a joke, you should be embarrassed for referencing it.

&gt; And yet the Economist says that Taiwan and Japan are flawed democracies. That study is far more transparent, you'll notice that East Asian states do (relatively) badly on civil liberties and political participation.

As if the Economist's index was any more credible. It's literally nothing more than a compiled score of a long questionaire. The fact that you are referencing it as if it were some sort of Bible is just laughable.

&gt; Guess what? When you live in a homogeneous state with a pliant population and very little political diversity, you don't get many protests or civil disruption. Part of the reason that cosmopolitan, politically diverse countries such as the US, the UK or France, do worse is because they've been compelled to place limits on public assembly and the right to protest precisely because their freedoms and cultures gives way to massive demonstration efforts on a regular basis (Black Lives Matter, Gilet Jaunes, etc...).

Again this simply shows how little you know about us.
 In 2014 [a massive protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_Student_Movement) began with a group of people storming in the parliament. The protest lasted three months and those activists stayed *IN* the parliament for 3 weeks without *any* forceful removals by the state. Imagine what would happen if protesters storming in the Westminster Palace. I don't even want to imagine as that would be bloody af.

Late 2016 South Korea saw a wave of [absolutely epic protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%932017_South_Korean_protests) that lead to the successful impeachment of their President. The protests lasted almost 6 months and at several points more than 2 million Koreans joined the protest in Seoul. Britain has not had any protest of the same scale in forever even though the Lower House have been in absolute shambles ever since the Brexit vote.

June 2020, Taiwan held a recall election which successfully removed the mayor of the second largest city simply because he was doing a very poor job. He got almost 50% more recall votes than in the election that got him elected 2 years ago. Dominic Cummings has broken quarantine rules 6 times and no amount of uproar has apparently been able to remove him. 

But sure. We are more pliant and our societies are more authoritarian.

1585,"Sure, if you want my answer, I can give it to you. You wouldn't like it though. Why? 

Muh human rights. But since you insist, here are my thoughts.

Europe has to implement what China is doing in regards to its Muslim population. No need for camps, but compulsory education on European National values - i.e: what must be done to be French. What it is to be German...etc. Failure to comply must result in penalties and other things to compel participation and adherence. The more they fail, the more severe the penalties. 

All cultural and religious practices that are incompatible with the national identity must be firmly banned and anybody that practices it punished for each infraction. No exceptions.

After that, Muslims are free to practice their religion, however, no outside influence are absolutely allowed. All practices of their religion must not override the national identity. This applies to all religions. The nation and Europe comes first. No Wahhabi shit. No foreign imams of any stripes. 

Any mosques build must conform to Western standards and shape to reinforce that you are in Europe. No other mosques are allowed. All must be sanctioned and established by the state. The Islam that European Muslim practices must be European Islam, compatible with European way of life only. 

No other forms of preachings allowed or taught. Apply this to all religions. No nutty Christian fundamentalists from America too. 

No religious schools. All religions taught must be done via public schools where the co-curriculum is monitored and reinforced. 

All preachings in mosques must be monitored and no extremist shit allowed at all. Only European sanctioned Imams are allowed to preach every Friday and preach things compatible with European values. 

Any Muslim that travelled overseas and studied in foreign religious schools must be monitored to ensure that they don't spread any religious ideals that is incompatible with European values.

All Muslims in subsequent generations must be made aware that whatever happens they are Europeans first, not Muslims first. Islam must be made like a lifestyle choice, not an overriding identity that threatens Europe. 

Block online preachings at all costs. Censor the internet. 

Anyone that is not happy with the arrangements is free to leave Europe. Anyone that don't comply must be punished.

Also, Europe must do more to alleviate poverty among the Muslims like China did. Give them other things to think about aside from religion. Promote secularism and rational thought.

Going after mosques makes no sense and having a policy that targets that without any evidence it would be effective would literally just add more fuel to the fire that European countries are repressing religion and this creating more extremists.

Existing resentment continues towauyyu⁸rds original colonizers (right or wrong), and they decide to move for better opportunities even with that resentment. Immigrants tend to collect together due to goverment policy and convenience but over time, if those groups aren't persecuted they naturally tend to blend into society simply through proximity.

*According to the coroner's examination after the exhumation, both the report and the testimonies of witnesses, concurred that the Soviets cut off tongues, ears, genitals, scalps, put genitals into mouths, picked out eyes, pulled off fingernails, made belts of victims' skins to tie their hands, burned them with torches and acid, crushed bones and skulls, all done while the prisoners were still alive. The organizers of the massacre included Pyotr Raslan, Boris Mironov, Nachman Dushanski, political leader of 8th border army Mikhail Kompanyanec, NKVD Kretinga county deputy director Yermolayev, NKVD lieutenant Zhdanov and others.*

1908,"Now let me tell you why that's incorrect, and I won't be speaking from the perspective of a protester. Bear with me, it's a longer post.

A few years ago I was elected into a student body responsible for organizing graduation celebrations and other events. This body was a very important one, it made every decision, from where the events would be held, to how much each participant would have to pay. For this latter reason, it was infamous. It was literally known for being corrupt and for the stolen money by the elected students.

I didn't want anyone to steal my money, so I became a candidate, and was elected. And then I helped steal money.

The students couldn't to SHIT. And we were responsible for their money. They had no oversight, no transparency, no knowledge, no power...nothing. Were we all bad? No, some stood firmly against taking money that's not yours, but to the rest it didn't matter. A contract had to be signed? The corrupt would RUSH to take the initiative and be the one to sign. This way we could hide the contract and no one would have any way of finding out the real costs.

Oh and the students protested. They complained to the professors, to the principal even...We were constantly bombarded with questions, with demands to look at the contract, to know how we calculated the individual prices and much more. Some students protested by not giving us a single cent.

None of it mattered in the end.

They gave in and gave money. We weren't fools, we knew they couldn't afford to skip on their graduation ceremony. When asked for the contracts, we'd pass the ball to each other, and eventually the students would give up. Oh, what's that? The simplest tie costs 22 euros? Oops, we don't have a bill, the dad of that dude owned the store and gave it to us cheaper. We would often ""forget"" to announce something until days before the deadline, students would panic and would not question anything. We truly had no challenge.

**The ONLY thing the students could've done to REALLY stop us**, **would be to disrupt the shit out of everything.** The professor wants to get into a classroom? Sorry, this class won't be held until they show us that contract. Oh you want to have an exam? Sorry, I will keep running until they explain how we are overpaying this meal by 50%. This would've put pressure on the professors and they would've put **real** pressure on us. We would've relented.

But that didn't happen. And I ended up paying nothing for any of these events. I walked away with money that's 30% of the minimum wage here. Some walked home with an entire minimum wage - while barely doing anything...",SFR YUGOSLAVIA,/r/europe/comments/jm1i85/president_of_slovenia_running_past_antigovernment/gatr27h/,zippydazoop,1604262251

Also if you think that being in EU should give any member unconditional support from other members without looking if they are right or wrong... Then you can't really say anything to Turkey for trying to insert it own rights, interests and plans  by it's own, even if Turkey isn't right or justified. I mean you can demand to counter Turkey from your own nation or even other EU states but you can't criticize Turkey for that if you really think that way. 

Also like I said Erdoğan is a populist and he needs enemies the more enemies the better, but if you still haven't realized Macron is a populist as well and he uses the same strategies as Erdoğan and he needs enemies as well.

Re the war, yes, Turkey's involvement now is key.  Not what I think but what all objective analysts think.  Comes down to defender's advantage and who is fighting to survive, like in the 90s.

The conflict in the 90s was similar to now - the NKAO voted for independence, Azerbaijan shelled them, NKAO was forced to take out the positions that are shelling them, and of course Azerbaijan brought mujahidin, NKAO started with like 1 tank and was so outnumbered and outfinanced...  Back then though Turkey was more constructive, but then it shut the border and sent a few special forces, but nothing like now, it kind of did that for internal consumption but didn't really want to help.

The goal of Erdogan right now is not to invade Armenia, which won't happen, or Karabakh, which has no value in that sense, but to use and own more of Azerbaijan - de facto controlling Nakhijevan, military all over, and lots of money to and advertising for his son-in-law's company...

Turkey's help is enough to keep it going, so now it's dragging on and casualties are high.

Aliyev thought it would be easy and made promises, lots of people already died, he can't back out now but he needs Turkey's help or the campaign will collapse tomorrow.  And failure on this front meant exile for previous Azerbaijani leaders, whereas success would cement his dictatorship.

Imagine the leverage Erdogan has on Aliyev right now.

(And Putin on Pashinyan, but Armenia has nothing to give.)

Please keep in mind that you're dealing with the average of all of the US. This isn't a reflection of modern education, as much as it is the education of the past and lack of life-long learning post-schooling to accommodate for changing geopolitics in other continents. Much of Eastern Europe would've been lumped into the USSR or Yugoslavia in the education of previous decades, and so the newer nations lose name recognition among those older Americans who were only educated on what the official state was and not constituent parts. 

Beyond that, the map follows pretty closely on two trends: places that Americans of European descent trace their lineage back to and places that have been frequent in the news here over the last 20 years.

To explain that last bit, I'm sure you're all aware of the American habit of claiming to be Irish or German based on their (great) grandparents, whereas that's not really as much of a thing for Portugal (outside of that weird section of Massachusetts) or Czechia (most Americans who know their ancestors were from the region either know or assume themselves to be Bohemian German by ancestry then might get mixed up by the Czechoslovakia stuff). The ethnic Norwegian and Swedish enclaves on the other hand push really hard to make their identity and the flags of those countries well known (fucking Stoughton), while the ethnic Polish are less vocal in making themselves distinct.

I did not introduce insults to this discussion. Cry me a river. 

&gt;They warned that Islamic Nationalists are around, as they are. You and your media are inflating their numbers and impact. 

Really? So how many of them are there? Where does your information come from? 

&gt;behind a paywall before it goes into the detail of the survey. I don't buy it.

How convenient. What about this?

https://www.channel4.com/press/news/c4-survey-and-documentary-reveals-what-british-muslims-really-think

&gt;Sharia isn't legal law. Sharia is ""go to the mosque for a marriage contract"" to most Muslims. Or personal law. The survey itself is bias in it's questions.

Sharia in the west would be at first separate law to legal law in a society which could be potentially turned in the legal law (and was in several Muslim countries already) down the line (but probably would not, because I do expect Islam to get reformed down the line). Democracy does not know separate laws for different citizens based on faith. You won't have abortion being illegal for Christians and legal for others, because they want it. It is inexcusable to support it as a separate rules that Muslims have to obey in the west. 

&gt;People are allowed to try to solve their problems with their communities and families before going to the law. This is normal across ALL societies, including secular and atheist ones.

Are you high or something? When father abuses his family and at mosque they advise mother to stay silent about it, you call that solution?

&gt;Just like many other religious groups. They polled people at the mosque, when they poll Muslims outside of the mosques in France:

That does not excuse that 100 percent found it morally reprehensible and over 50 percent would want it illegal. What does it say about what is being preached at mosques when this is the beliefs of people who visit them in UK? Fact that it France its much lower does not excuse the fact that in UK it's way too high. Ofc. that there would be differences between countries when every country receives immigrants from different places. 

&gt;This is also the same of every other people. Germans prefer to be with germans. Atheists prefer there were more atheists in their countries. 

Learn to read. It says Turkish people only, it is not about just preference. I am non-believer. I don't prefer to be with other non-believers, I prefer to be with sane people regardless of country or religion. Even with sane Muslim rather than stupid atheist. 


&gt;CULTURES, not religion. Islam has already westernized across the world. There are mosques that accept the LGBT people, mosques that lecture in the native tongue, etc. Yes, the culture of say, the Saudis doesn't mesh with the culture of Canadians.

I agree. But through identity and through failed migration policies, those are often intertwined. But many Muslim countries are getting westernized, and I do believe that things can improve significantly over the years, but it is still a fact that currently, there are just significantly more problems with integration of Muslims in most western countries than let's say Eastern Asians or Indians, or immigrants from culturally similar background. Especially to those countries who lack proper migration policy. One of the reason Canada does not have all that many problems is that they have very strict immigration policy, one of the most strict in the world. Same for Australia. Europe just did not enforce it all that much for several decades, that is why the situation is different. 
I'm not even saying it's primarily because of their religion, but currently the west is in conflict with parts of the Muslim world and religion became indirectly part of the conflict and now it can even propel it. That is why Erdogan is trying to pose the problem as West vs Islam, because there is this connection. Western countries partially brought it upon themselves, partially it's because of cultural differences, partially because of religious differences. But fact is, whenever Islam gets political, it creates a conflict. It's not just west, It's also India, Sudan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, you name it. Other religions don't have so many conflicts all across the globe as Islam does. If Muslims would keep Islam out of politics, it would be better for everybody. 

&gt;But immigrants become the the native culture in just 1 generation.

Most, on average. Not from every source, not from every place. As I said, many studies show that younger Muslims in Europe are more conservative and radicalized than their parents/grandparents. So you can't just take stat, which is true generally, and think that it does not allow any exceptions anywhere. 

-------

US Muslims are mostly integrated/assimilated. I agree with that. That is why I said nothing about them. The US is much better at integration of foreigners because it poses itself as a country of immigrants and also because its immigration policy is very strict too (with exception from illegal immigration from the South America). And there is still a lot of prestige in calling yourself American, so people are more incline to assimilate to claim it. 

&gt;""It is because of the demographics,"" claims Dr Dominic Kudlacek, from the Criminological Research Unit of Lower Saxony. ""Whether they're asylum seekers or EU migrants, they are younger than the average population and mostly male. Young men commit more crimes in every society.""

I don't ignore these things, I am well aware of them. That is why I did not talk about crime if you did not notice. But also what this does not take into account is that those newcomers are under strict supervision from German officials, and they still do quite a lot of crime. General population is not under so much supervision. And also a lot of harassment and petty crime, which is the core of the crime that is usually done by immigrants, often goes unreported.

Where did you get the idea that there's government funding of mosques? France has some of the [strictest separation of church &amp; state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_France) in the world. 

The ""tighter rules regarding immigration"" were implemented a long time ago. The vast majority of Muslims (that's who you mean by ""them""?) came to France without even ""immigrating"". They were already in French-occupied overseas territories, so they were moving from one part of France to another part of France.

You're talking about stripping people of citizenship whose family has been in France for generations and have been convicted of no crime -- other than being the wrong religion.

Again: what are you going to do to after you strip them of their citizenship? No other country will take them -- will you put them in enormous detention camps?

To be clear: there are already existing laws against inciting violence and they certainly should be enforced. And yes, [the vast majority of terrorist incidents in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_France) in the last decade have been committed by Muslims. But other countries have managed to integrate Muslims without the level of problems France has.

No, they also draw cartoons about Christian, Judaism figures, also politicians. And it's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  And now you're drawing comparisons to things that aren't a part of the  discussion.... Nazis? Predicting the future for what COULD be next?   Hyperbole much? 

If you payed attention to what I wrote, I started writing about ANY extremist group, the nazis were just an example.. I could have write about isis, boko haram, or any group that are included lists of extremist groups found on the internet.. I'm pretty sure you can find them.

And yes... what could be next is a prediction, just like you have in the US with the election.. you predict what candidate X or Y COULD do better or worse if elected. You act like people don't usually think for the future... just like Americans are screaming that if trump is re-elected they will loose democracy.... 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; People don't have to be assholes.  Drawing Mohammad does nothing for no  one except to get a reaction out of people who may be offended.  That's  it. Nothing good comes of it other than making others who you make not  like very upset.  If you have to draw Mohammad to get your point across,  you are not a smart person. 

They weren't drawing just Mohammad, they drew a lot of characters... none other punished them like the radicals did ... not long ago, 87 people died in Nice when a radical drove a truck into the crowd because of islamist terrorism.... 

My point is that there are 1.5B people who are muslims, but just few of them are soooo upset.. those are the radicals .. I don't know why you try to defend them.

Were you so upset and called people assholes when you saw people mocking Jesus ( for example )? I bet you  you weren't. Are you posting on r/atheism against people being assholes? .. I guess not....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Everyone deserves empathy. 

Actually, no, not everyone deserves empathy.. radicals don't deserve ( isis and other terrorist groups ), murderers don't deserves, rapists don't deserve, pedophiles don't deserve.. and I could find more groups.

&gt; Even someone as hateful as you deserves  empathy.  I hope you're able to find out your way out of your dark and  clouded thinking.

2190,"Interesting take. A report from a book on the long term power growth of Europe was interesting. Both Poland and Turkey were suppose to grow to great power status while the United Kingdom Italy and France would fall behind relative to their current status at the time. If you noticed, in reality both France and Germany have grown while both the Anglo sphere , the East Asian sphere, and the new great powers have lost. You pose an interesting comment, and worthy of research of what was going on in foreign affairs at the time of Edrogans election. Especially the United States and France would be worthy of studying. Maybe this was a power play by Germany and France, to the benefit of Russia as well. A great power in Poland and Turkey would limit or destroy their influence in Eastern Europe. I absolve the United States of knowing what Edorgan was, mostly because America only benefits from a stronger Poland/Turkish state. 

I also need to explain France and Germany so I am not downvoted to oblivion. French and German leadership have always been suspect of an American led world, with good reason. However they do not want a strong Russia, but rather a strong Europe. Poland and Turkey being great powers would do more damage to that vision because of nationalism in new world powers usually being stronger. Not always but usually. So if that report would have been correct, you would have a split Eastern Europe between Turkey and Poland, with France and Germany relegated into playing a game where American leadership could use Poland and Turkey to outweigh any French-German alliance inside the EU, thus making the EU a tool of the Anglo sphere or having an incoherent strategy between international rivals. 

Russia is also easy to explain, they want a strong enough EU to fight the US, but not strong enough to meddle in Russia 
‘S sphere of influence. So Russia has been pushing right winged society in both Poland and Turkey weakening them, while France and Germany have only made moves on paper to counter these moves. So why has n’t the United States tried to counter the Russian moves in either of these, either under Obama or Bush? Simple- no one cared. I think it’s becoming increasingly obvious that America is sliding back to isolationism since the end of the Cold War. Whether that’s good or not is up to the reader. A multipolar world often means more conflict, but a unipolar world often means less mobility for nations. Of course you can also say that a Stronger more independent EU fits with in that vision of an isolation of the US. Allowing the traditional Western and central EU powers to dominate the affairs allows for a predictable and quiet Europe. 

So in conclusion, I-have little doubt that most of the intelligence agencies knew what edrogan was both politically and economically, but the real questions really are at the diplomatic level- who did or did not make moves to counter him and to what capacity. Everything I said was a guess, and where slightly educated, I do not know or have an connection to any of these institutions on a whole.",,/r/europe/comments/jlzesw/erdogan_is_a_dangerous_element_for_the_free_world/gasza5e/,Alongstoryofanillman,1604248360

Turks are notoriously dual-loyal to Erdogan in Germany. They're just one example.

&gt; How can it be overcome without violence? 

... not sure to be honest. It's not like we have to engage in a civil war tomorrow... but not sure.

&gt;Do you advocate segregation because of these different identities between populations?

I don't think we need a complete segregation of peoples. I think what we need, first and foremost, is a global recognition of heritages, especially among Europeans. We need to be honest with ourselves and recognize that if we wish to maintain our people, our values, our heritage, and our strength, that we must form and act out an ethno-national identity. Once we're honest with ourselves and say ""Hey, diversity isn't all it's made up to be, we'd like to maintain our own things and people"", the groundwork has been laid for a better future.

Frankly I don't even mind some small ethnic minorities in a country, as long as they're no more than a cumulative 5-10%, and contribute to society. But any more than that, and we get into trouble. 

I think unfortunately, conflict of all kinds, but especially between peoples is inevitable (and I don't say that lightly), and it is up to everyone, especially us Europeans and white people, to also act in our best self-interest.

Long-term it's the current stances of the other parties that benefit the far-right, as slowly more and more people become single issue voters, and that issue is large scale immigration and its effects on social cohesion.

What the other parties desperately try to avoid is doing anything that could be interpreted as throwing them a bone or caving to a demand. Far-right bad. One of far-rights points is to curb immigration. Therefore curbing immigration bad. And they will not consider the issue on principle.

A couple years ago the Bavarian minister president said something about planning to curb migration and abuse of the asylum system. He promptly had to backpedal because all other parties literally accused him of ""AFD-speak"". Of course he made it a topic, he wanted to appeal to the single issue voters and tried to get them to stop voting far-right! It's completely asinine to think that every far-right voter actually became a fascist or even nazi in just six years, they just care about immigration that much that they'd rather put up with that instead. If another party took a hard stance on migration, the far-right party approval would drop by 90% over night.

A common misconception for example, is that the Quran forces women to wear Hijabs or Burqas, which isn’t true, the Quran offers a choice. The culture of Arab people is what does that. And also, i dont think its fair to say that a religious text is all about love. It’s teachings are about love, but as with the Abrahamic religions, lots of the shit in the books are weird stories where some awful things happen, like Noah’s ark or whatever, where God just fucking obliterates the world because humans did bad shit.

len na základe zákona a v jeho medziach, pri zachovaní základných práv a slobôd"".
Citované ustanovenie teda určuje, že ukladanie povinností i medze musia mať výlučne

takejto zákonnej úpravy musí však byť v súlade s ústavnoprávnym vymedzením základných

*There is an important relationship between continuously fulfilling religious activities and age. Individuals involve religious activities more in their lives as they get older. Younger individuals feel more distant from death due to the feelings caused by their young age and chose to continuously fulfill their religious activities later.*

*As a result of that survey and study, the research question “Why young people seem to participate in religious activity far less than older generations in terms of doing daily prayers, go to mosque to pray and to read Quran daily.” is proved. Total of data’s that I gathered show us, young generation are less participate to religious activities in compare to old generations.*

A spokesperson for the Assembly of Chechens in Europe strongly condemned the attack in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine by an 18-year-old Chechen Russian.

Sunday spent on the sidelines of the rally organized Place de la République, Jean-Luc Mélenchon had been controversial. Asked about the assassination two days earlier of Samuel Paty, the leader of France insoumise had directly pointed the finger at the ""Chechen community"", which brings together between 30,000 and 60,000 people in France and from which the assailant comes.

    ""You have to question what is happening with the Chechens in France. We welcomed Chechens who were supporters of a civil war against a background of religion. This is the second time that we have dealt with individuals linked to this community. , it can not continue like that "", he had then denounced.

Strong condemnation of the Chechens

Asked about BFMTV, Shamil Albakov, spokesperson for the Assembly of Chechens in Europe, a gathering of some 20 Chechen associations, strongly condemned the conflict in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine.

    ""First and foremost, we want to confirm our position once again. We very strongly condemn what happened and we don't even dare to think about what the victim's family and relatives feel. Through our assembly and other associations, we offered our condolences, we condemned this attack, it is a position that we want to make heard, ""he assures us.

""We are not here to sow terror""

If Jean-Luc Mélenchon has recognized an ""error"" in using the term ""Chechen community"", according to LFI number two Adrien Quatennens, Chamil Albakov does not take offense and denounces a political recovery. He salutes the attitude of France, which welcomed the Chechens during the civil war which bloodied the region.

    ""On behalf of our entire community, we are grateful for everything they have done for us. What happened has horrified us and the French must understand that we are condemning. We are not here to sow the seeds. terror, fear. (...) We are here in France, most of them integrate, learn the language, work "", he adds.

Still addressing Jean-Luc Mélenchon, this same spokesperson insists on the fact that the majority of Chechens are integrated into French civil society.

    ""I point out to Mélenchon that thousands of Chechens are ensuring the safety of the French in businesses, stores, swimming pools, and other thousands are in the process of building, they work in the building industry, in all sectors of French life. It is not because there is a young person who has been manipulated that Mélenchon or others have the right to accuse us in such a way "", he insists.

A demonstration in Nice

So in order not to leave room for confusion, Chamil Albakov believes that his community must speak out and continue to condemn the attack. This is what happened on Monday in Nice, where around fifty Chechens gathered in Place Massena to pay tribute to Samuel Paty.

    ""We do not agree at all with that, we are very saddened and we do not want that to happen. Nobody deserves to be murdered in such a way"", estimated a demonstrator, while another underlined the many death threats received on social networks in recent days.

""The Assembly of Chechens in Europe encouraged all citizens to speak out, to speak out,"" Shamil Albakov concludes.

In recent years, the Chechen community has been repeatedly shaken by attacks or acts of violence. In May 2018, the perpetrator of a knife attack that left one dead in Paris was of Chechen origin.

Most of my friends in NYC were there because of the troubles with either their dads being part of it and on the run or their family wanting peace and security.

There were over 40 bars on a 10 block stretch of town so there were some places that were basically fronts to store weapons going back to the north. 

The men behind noraid took advantage of the irish American longing to belong to something, such as their irish heritage, and used it to extract a great deal of money.

2844,"&gt;You said.

&gt;&gt;What Greece wants to do is connect the EEZ between each island, making a gigantic EEZ that isn't representative at all

&gt;and

&gt;&gt;What you see is that France doesn't try to connect the various islands to make huge swaths. They only claim areas around the island, and that's it.

Below are your words stating that Polynesia is closer than Rhodes and Kas.

&gt;You missed Polynesia then and Saint Paul and Amsterdam, those two.being 91 kms from each other, which is much further than most Greek islands are from one another.

&gt;Meanwhile the distance between Rhodes and Kastelorizo is 125 kms.

&gt;If you don't see the issues with occupying a foreign land and using a puppet State that no other country beside Turkey recognizes as an excuse to drill in Cyprus' water, no need to complain about Greece's EEZ being maximalist.

Logically this argument doesn't make any sense. I simply don't understand what Cyprus has to do with Greece's EEZ claims.

&gt;Not between ""connecting islands and mainland"". That means nothing if the island is an integral part of the State, being or not on the mainland held no difference. Alaska and Hawaï aren't less the USA despite not being connected to the 48 continuous States. Both create territorial waters and EEZ the same way California does.

But Hawaii also doesn't have a connected EEZ, so what is your point?

My point is, why is the Kas EEZ being connected to Cyprus and Rhodes, to cut a large area. Why doesn't Kas have it's own EEZ, with Turkey having their EEZ around the sides past where Kas' ends.

&gt;The dodecanese islands and Cyclades archipelago islands are Greece's national territory like Corsica or Sicily. There is no difference between an mainland being part of one State, and its potential islands. Corsica isn't lesser than France the same way Sicily is lesser than Italy, they are part of their respective State. Rhodes is not lesser than Greece, it is Greece. Here is the current territorial waters set around a 11km limit. Rhodes is Greece's national territory the same way Peloponnese is

I see nothing wrong with Greece's claims in the Aegean. I only see an issue in the Mediterranean. That's primarily why I've only mentioned Med.

&gt;Meanwhile Montego bay says that EZZ are up to 370 km max, Kastelorizo is well within 370km from Rhode's baseline

But it's also within 370 km of Turkey. So which state gets the EEZ? The one we feel like? Or maybe there's a reasonable line in that the one who's closer should get the EEZ (I believe there's a midline resolution offered in the law as well?)


Even without that, even if the baseline of reference was Greece's ""mainland"", which it isn't but anyway, Kastelorizo is less than 370 km from Rhodes, which is less than 370 km from Samos, which is less than 370 km from the many Cyclades composing the archipelago, the closer being less than 370 km from the mainland. So an EEZ continuity between Kastelorizo and the mainland seem doable.

Right, and again I ask, does that sound reasonable? To just ignore another country who is also within 370km? How are you deciding which one gets the EEZ?

&gt;What about yours?

A reasonable resolution is my only team. Greece's claims are absolutely bonkers, and meant to block any sea route between Turkey and Africa. That's pretty much what it looks like to me.

&gt;But do understand that Turkey's claim is also to be understood and that both EEZ claim have some valid points. But the one currently occupying foreign land and drilling in foreign EEZ isn't Greece.

Again, this is completely unrelated, you need to explain how water rights are linked to this. Because America invaded Iraq, we can choose to ignore any EEZ claims they make?",,/r/europe/comments/jku7fj/its_time_to_expel_turkey_from_nato/gar8qho/,-Notorious,1604197808

It's an image I could of course hold up and pound down your brain until you believe that is the west. And of course you can do the same about the Muslim world. But who believes that? Only those who choose to or those who are ig krant. As of Muslims who are plagued by the same terrorists in their homelands, who fought decades against those forces are out celebrating attacks in France. Simply not true.

2885,"&gt; When on welfare (bijstand) you get €1150,- plus €104 for healthcare insurance and €330,- of rent subsidies. That is €1584,- without lifting a single finger.

Couple this with not owning a car (using public transport) and you have even more money than this. A lot of jobs require a car and purchasing of oil. Owning a car comes with a hefty road tax, Netherlands is an extremely expensive country when it comes to oil due to all the added tax on it. 

&gt; Anyone working a below average income job in the Netherlands is either insane or too good for this world.

Well to apply for bijstand isn't that easy. You really need to have nothing at all to receive it. Most Dutch residents wouldn't really fall into bijstand category even if they wanted to. A lot of foreigners from non EU countries (Africa / middle east) or former refugees however fall into this category. They typically have nothing in this country (no assets, nothing saved up etc). Couple that with a difficult to learn language and a lack of basic education in country from origin and you know who the recipients of this typically are.

In this case, all your lands belongs to Turkey. Does it give right for Turkey to take Yerevan? No right? Reason is international law. It belongs to Armenia and their neighbors should abide the laws. Armenia also should abide the laws and admit defeat. I am not saying that Armenian population in Karabakh should leave their lands.

To be honest, I have been constantly reading both sides of the story as a biased 3rd party in this conflict. I understand that both bombed areas are happening due to current conflict. I find cynical that Armenia says that they are not in active war and yet are bombing civilian cities and power plants from Armenia (not Karabakh) and yet still saying that Azerbaijani side is the one attempting genocide/war crimes. Armenia is the one committing war crimes all along. 

Stepanakert is an active conflict zone.

Are you kidding me.

The Kurds you are talking about are members of the YPG, which are the Syrian wing of the Kurdish PKK. They are recognized as terrorists by several NATO nations including the United States. https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/

The campaign against the YPG was to secure the Turkish-Syrian border against the YPG. Russia only stepped in after Turkey attacked Assad's forces, not the YPG.

Even Lindsey Graham, the fiercest critic of Turkey's involvement in Syria, admitted this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-g8RVtYBM4&amp;ab_channel=TurkishHeritageOrganization

No. Armenian citizens aren’t allowed to enter. Ethnic Armenian people with an Armenian last name aren’t allowed to enter. Azerbaijan deported 400.000 Armenians out of Azerbaijan in the early 1990’s (after killing some of them in the Sumgait, Kirovabad, Baku and Maragha massacres 😬😬) 
Not that any Armenian would want to live in a dictatorship which awarded an Ax murderer who killed Armenians in his sleep and got the title of a National Hero. 
Truth is yes. Azerbaijanis got displaced too. However, they were offered to come back and live in Artsakh MULTIPLE TIMES. Your own dictator didn’t integrate your own refugees to have them as a bargaining chip in negotiations. YOU care about the land. WE care about the safety of ourselves and our right to live in our own homes, and safely. This is not a territorial dispute, you Want to commit genocide, otherwise you wouldn’t kill every Armenian civilian you come into contact with.

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned in the link, a shit ton of people gather that day (gonna call it ASD from now for convenience)  at the cementeries. Especially old people, who are in the greatest risk of dying of COVID. Reasonable people went there a few days before, to avoid standing in the crowd and potentially getting infected. But let's' be practical, it's Poland,  of course there will be crowds at the graveyards that day (A lot of people don't care about their dead relatives in any other days then ASD xD But that's polish catholics in a nutshell, and that's not important now)

&amp;#x200B;

Another important info:

In that day a HUGE amount of flowers and candles are sold. On that particular day, and a couple of others ( Mother's Day, Woman's Day etc) the sellers probably make more money that in a couple of 'normal' months. 

For a few weeks, Polish gov has been recommending people to either go there a few days before, or not go at all. They also promised they WON'T completely close the cementeries.

Sure,whatever. The sellers adapted,

Yesterday, PM has come out and said they're locking the cementeries (due to the pandemic reasons obviously) 

Now, I'm not saying it's a bad idea, or a good idea. That doesn't matter.

But announcing that a little more than a day before the actual date is a huge punch in the face to the flower business, they have been hearing one thing, and in the last moment gov changes its mind. Flower business is pissed off, because they've been deceived. Candles can be sold later. But the flowers are only gonna go to the trash can in a few days. 

GJ killing small businesses.

These fuckers are either more retarded than everyone thought, or are doing this on purpose. Don't know what's worse.

I was looking at entry-level (or at least in my field entry-level) IT jobs, and data-analyst, junior developers, dev-ops go for about 40k a year. In Czechia, these are above average paid jobs, but the online net wage calculator for Austria shows 2,2k a month with 40k annual salary (if you get 13/14th wage, it would be slightly less per month since it would be divided into 14 payments, but those two payments will be taxed less so you get additional let's say 0.5k per year out of that. ).

No, they're not going to catch everyone. But even if they catch some small amount of people, it's still helpful to decrease the R number. If they manage to decrease the R number enough, it gives precious time to hospitals to get running full steam again (doctors and nurses, who have been ill, are available again).

Unfortunately it's not ""only 80yr"" people in the hospitals. I personally know 3 people born in 1980s, who had to be intubated. I also know some people, who didn't even knew they had it.  

It is not impossible that most people will develop some kind of immunity before the vaccine is available, but we just can't risk it.  

Let me entertain that simplistic idea of yours, that hospitals will be overloaded only because of old people.

germany and turkey are great trade partners and the sole reason eu has not yet imposed sanction to turkey, which is at least hilarious considering that turkey actively broke the law of the sea against eu members, i wonder what eu means any more, and at the same time italy, span and malta support turkey within eu for their own economical interests, not to mention the guns turkey can enjoy buying as if they wont be used against cyprus ang greece from span italy and germany.

balkans is a bunch of small states with economical problems, which gives a lot of room for turkey to actively make investments and buy soft power, they actually do that in bosnia, albania but also in serbia, and even greece is not unaffected from turkey trying to buyout a piece of greece's real estate and construction market share. 

saying that people dislike turkey might be true, but people do not actually take decisions, when the government party in serbia needs money to keep its power, they will get the money from someone, and turkey jumps in to promise some dozens of millions of euros in investments, which serbian government welcomed.

Throw away your beads and your crosses.

Some people are making mad money here too.

For me Ireland was an El Dorado and gave me a chance that France would never have.

I have friends who came here with nothing but a back pack, broken english, and no degree to speak of and 3 years later they now live comfortably with corporate jobs in big tech companies earning more than that average salary.

I hope covid doesn't break that Dublin magic, but I feel like it's needed because of the rent alone.


When I first started I was also offered a position in Lisbon and a position in Krakow. If I am honest with you, I would have made more money in both. I would have lived much more comfortably and for Lisbon at least the food and weather would have helped a lot.


Money is but one metric. Standards of living, happiness and purchasing power might be other angles to consider.

So even if a way to apply for asylum abroad was implemented (and I personally agree with your idea), it wouldn't make any difference regarding the problem with trafficking, because all these people who make false applications want to file them in Europe, because they know that even if their application fails in the vast majority of the cases they will stay anyway.

Of course Ireland also is a very stable country as well and there are loads of other reasons to set up business there but low corporate tax is a big one for sure.

During the spring and early summer of 2020, Dutch veterinary researchers made a unique - not to say scary - discovery.

Not only did they identify as the first in the world countless corona-infected mink on a number of large mink farms in the eastern part of the country - with the result that in a few days about three-quarters of a million of the small fur animals had to be destroyed.

They also discovered something even more startling, namely the world's first direct example of how an animal species can infect humans with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

As Dutch researchers concluded in a study not yet peer-reviewed, published on September 1:

""To the best of our knowledge, these are the first documented human-to-human SARS-CoV-2 infection events.""

While the number of confirmed cases of coronary heart disease in late spring began to decline in the Netherlands in general, it rose sharply among people associated with mink farms with outbreaks.

As many as 68 percent of those closely related to farms with corona-infected mink - including owners, employees and their families - were infected.

At the same time, there were certain signs that chains of infection subsequently continued from person to person and thus further out into the local communities.

On Friday afternoon, corona outbreaks were found on 182 Danish mink farms. In addition, 33 farms are under suspicion.

There are a total of 1,138 mink production properties in Denmark.

In 2018, 17.2 million mink were produced in Denmark. Since then, however, production has fallen.

It must be estimated that over one million Danish mink have so far been infected with the new coronavirus.

There are roughly as many infected mink in Denmark as there are confirmed cases of infection among people in, for example, Spain or the United Kingdom.

Mink are extremely susceptible to the infection, which in a week can run through a farm with 15,000 mink and infect all individuals.

In that process, rapid mutations occur in viruses that can infect humans.

In Denmark, it has been decided to kill all mink within a radius of 7.8 kilometers from a mink farm with outbreaks.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/jldpjv/the_coronavirus_infection_rates_reaches_dangerous/gaofpsg/,stenbroenscooligan,1604126298

No country in the world has as many mink as Denmark - about two and a half times as many as there are people in this nation.

Since the first corona outbreak was discovered in June on a mink farm near Sindal in North Jutland, the infection has exploded among the biting predators and has now reached a scale that has no equal anywhere else on the planet.

Denmark simply has the world's largest corona outbreak among a species other than humans, and we both have and have had far, far more corona-infected mink than we have had corona-infected humans in Denmark. Which poses a particular danger.

On Friday afternoon, according to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, there had been a corona outbreak on well over twice as many Danish mink farms as in the Netherlands: 182 properties. In addition, another 36 farms are under suspicion.

This means that all approximately five million mink on these farms must be killed, and at least one million of them are documented to be corona infected.

Since the outbreak started in North Jutland, it has spread to both West, Central and Southern Jutland for mysterious reasons. As well as to Læsø.

Recently, several major outbreaks have been observed around Holstebro, where a number of the country's largest mink farms are located.

Nevertheless, we in Denmark have not killed nearly as many mink as in the Netherlands: currently around one million against about 2.6 million in the Netherlands.

Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Mogens Jensen (S) stated on Thursday after a consultation in the Folketing that ""our starting point is that we continue to have mink production in Denmark"".

The main reason for the slower Danish reaction can very well be found in the fact that Denmark has not made a political decision to completely phase out mink production. In the Netherlands, following pressure from animal welfare groups and further provoked by this year's major outbreaks on mink farms, the government has decided to suspend all mink production from the end of March 2021.

In other words, Danish mink farmers have a strong interest in at least being allowed to keep some of their mink bitches, so they can have a lot of small mink puppies next year. Whereby production can be maintained and the demand for mink fur in China in particular is met.

176 mink-infected Danes

In Denmark, however, researchers have also made a number of startling and somewhat worrying discoveries in infected mink as well as in employees and family members on mink farms.

According to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, there were per. On 26 October, 176 covid-19-infected Danes were identified with a special mink variant of the virus in their bodies. Four of these had no association with mink farms, which must mean human-to-human transmission with a coronavirus genetically modified by mink.

In addition, at least five different mutations or variants of the virus have been identified in infected mink in Denmark. The mutations apparently took place very quickly in the mink and took place in the virus' special ""spikes"" or ""spikes"", which it uses to attach itself and infect cells in humans (and mink).

In the worst case, this could mean that the virus, by virtue of the species jump from humans to mink and back to humans, ends up mutating in a direction that a future vaccine will not have an effect on - or will have a weakened effect on.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/jldpjv/the_coronavirus_infection_rates_reaches_dangerous/gaofqbj/,stenbroenscooligan,1604126314

It is crucial to emphasize that this has not happened yet - and does not have to happen at all. But should that happen, the world risks, in a sense, having to face a whole new or partially new contagious threat - a kind of Sindal coronavirus instead of Wuhan coronavirus, if you will.

A similar concern applies to our immune system. If you have already been infected and later become infected with a particular mink variant of the virus, there is a theoretical risk that our immune system will not be able to recognize and defeat the threat.

It should also be mentioned that we as human beings already have enough to do with fighting the coronas infection among ourselves.

If roughly the same virus also to a large extent also abounds in a completely different species, which we 'produce' in millions on large farms, each with thousands of mink, we inadvertently risk storing a reservoir of active coronavirus, which can at any time infection back to humans. And launch new chains of infection.

According to researchers, mink are unusually susceptible to infection with the new coronavirus, more so than cats or dogs, for example. This is because mink in their surface cells in the throat and lungs have so-called receptors to which viruses can bind, which are almost identical to human receptors. Infected mink typically have difficulty breathing and become visibly cold.

In addition, due to the high density and the very high number of individuals in mink stables, the corona infection almost runs like a steppe fire through a herd.

Thus, at the same time and in a very small area, huge amounts of virus are produced, which can be transmitted back to humans.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/jldpjv/the_coronavirus_infection_rates_reaches_dangerous/gaofqok/,stenbroenscooligan,1604126325

Finally, there is this striking fact:

Last week, Jammerbugt Municipality in North Jutland was a transition the municipality in Denmark with the absolute highest corona incidence. That is, with the most newly infected per. 100,000 inhabitants. A few places further down were Brønderslev and Hjørring - all municipalities that excel at some of the country's highest concentrations of mink farms.

Since then, the sparsely populated North Jutland municipalities have fallen slightly down the infection list, but the only ones who still ""surpass"" them in the country are densely populated municipalities with a number of immigrants, predominantly on Copenhagen's Vestegn. That is, places where the infection has, from experience, been very easy to spread.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/jldpjv/the_coronavirus_infection_rates_reaches_dangerous/gaofr0t/,stenbroenscooligan,1604126335

No. Just no.

I am Brazilian and while I can believe that this may have happened, it definitely is NOT normal.

A number of different things make Brazil violent, and better yet, make Brazil appear violent.

Things that make it violent: drug trafficking, specially to Europe, of drugs produced in neighboring countries like Colombia. Brazil's borders are too big, and the money that fuels gangs comes from Europe which is in Euro, worth almost 7 times more than local Brazilian currency. The drugs go through Brazil because Brazil's airports are the main ones that go to Europe from South America. I am not blaming Europe here, I am just stating the situation of drug trafficking in Brazilian soil.

Things that make it appear violent (even more than it is, and it is really violent): Brazil is in a development stage right now that technology is widely available enough that violence can be recorded and denounced just about everywhere, but not developed enough to prevent violence from actually occurring

3986,"&gt;Driving through the Faroes is unlike anything - after every turn and tunnel a new epic scenery emerges. Most times you find yourself driving in between the ocean and high rising mountains from which you can get the best sense of scale.

The Faroe or Faeroe Islands (Faroese: Føroyar; Danish: Færøerne) are a North Atlantic archipelago located 320 kilometres north-northwest of Scotland, and about halfway between Norway and Iceland. It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. The islands have a total area of about 1,400 square kilometres with a population of 52,656 as of August 2020.

The terrain is rugged; the climate is subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc)—windy, wet, cloudy, and cool. Temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the Gulf Stream.

Because the Faroe Islands are not part of the same customs area as Denmark, the country has an independent trade policy, and can establish trade agreements with other states. In the Nordic Council, they are represented as part of the Danish delegation. In certain sports, the Faroe Islands field their own national teams.

Despite only having one laureate, the Faroe Islands currently have the most Nobel laureates per capita worldwide.

There are other situations where a politician will switch to a third party or independent while in the middle of their term. Like here in Florida, in 2010, our Governor left the Republican party and became an independent. There have been a many independents elected to Congress too. Its pretty rare in modern times, but not unheard of. Bernie Sanders served in Congress as an independent for like 20 years, I think. We actually have 1 member of the Libertarian Party in Congress right now because he switched parties which is pretty cool.

Scotland had its fair share of constituencies turned blue, but those areas tend to have closer connections with England - the borders and Edinburgh, meanwhile areas that identify themselves more as ""Scottish"", overwhelmingly voted to remain, *and* voted for the SNP, whose stance is rejoining the EU.

Our State TV, which became a ridiculous pro-current-administration propaganda tube - check out [my translation of an evening news (not political ad, news) segment aired shortly before presidential election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOZR2OxM4uc) - first called protesters ""sowers of death"" because of protesting in 2nd wave of the pandemic, shortly after it showed former leader of a [ONR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Radical_Camp) - fascist organization\* - calling on people to **drive to Warsaw, our capital to defend the churches**.

Here's a translation of [the page where they announced it](https://www.onr.com.pl/2020/10/27/onr-powoluje-brygady-narodowe/)

&gt;In connection with the rapidly growing wave of extreme left-wing aggression, which targets the Church and places of religious worship and national remembrance to a large extent, the General Board of the National-Radical Camp announces the calling of National Brigades.

&gt;The main aim of this initiative is to create a structure for the protection of Polish society, religious objects and patriotic events from militant attacks and provocations by neo-Marxists, which are another incarnation of Bolshevism.

&gt;As Polish nationalists, we want to provide Poles with the opportunity to safely carry out religious practices and cultivate traditions.

&gt;We also want to promote respect for physical culture, care for the development of fitness and fortitude through systematic training and training in martial arts, strength sports, shooting, survival and other disciplines.

&gt;We will work on the formation of **Political Soldiers** - conscious Poles, **ideological** and spiritual, and at the same time **taking care of the development of physical strength**, who will be ready to **defend national and Catholic values** through **direct action**.

Some babies are born sick. They often get better and grow into healthy adults. I was very sick when I was born and almost died. Are you saying I should have been killed because there was a chance I could have died? That doesn’t make any sense.

And you’re also justifying killing someone because they have deformities? Who are you to say who should live or die? Would you tell someone who has a deformity that they should have been killed instead?

And in regard to “women will have to give birth to dead babies” do you not know what abortion is or how it works??

You seem to have no compassion or appreciation toward the preciousness of life, and that it takes hard work to love someone - but that it’s worth it. There have been many people in your life offering you that love from the moment you were conceived, to where you are now. I would hate to see what your life would be without those people.

Muslims that stand up for French law - right to blaspheme - as well as free speech and condemn the attacker unequivocally with no “but”... 

And stand up for the right to paint or insult the prophet... those Muslims I can say are okay...

4167,"The SNP were a very minor party (around 2% of the vote) until the discovery of oil in the North Sea. They immediately claimed ""It's Scotland's oil"" and used the revenue figures to show that Scotland would be richer than the UK if it became independent.

That remained their position up to the 2014 referendum. For that referendum they took the revenue forecasts of the UK government, calculated how much they'd go up if oil prices and production increased, and costs fell, and came up with a figure (£7 - £8 billion) that showed Scotland would be richer.

In fact revenue plunged after the referendum (it was about £200 million in 2016, the year the SNP planned for Scotland to become independent). No analyst thinks oil revenue will ever return to previous levels (it may reach £2 billion in a good year, negative in a bad year).

But for 40+ years, the adult lifetime of almost all the SNP members, their plans have been based on using the oil revenue to replace the extra money the UK government provides Scotland. That extra revenue has now reached £12 billion a year, the oil revenue has fallen close to zero, and the SNP remain committed to independence but without any concrete plan to replace the fiscal transfer from the UK.

The problem for the SNP is while they might be able to convince people to ignore that fact during a referendum, the UK would probably end the fiscal transfer immediately after, and Scotland would be trying to negotiate independence from the UK in the midst of an immediate, and massive, public finance crisis. They'd have to sustain the government and the majority for independence for roughly 2 years during an unprecedented financial squeeze.",,/r/europe/comments/jkx2je/spotted_in_the_netherlands/ganm0bf/,WhiteSatanicMills,1604104142

Brussels can't do that to Westminster.

And Scotland isn't looking to burn it's trade bridges the same way Westminster is with Brussels; we're not wanting to get WTO terms by the back door.

So suburb isolation was also used initially, people not able to travel outside an area of more than 2 or 3 designated suburbs. Then as rolled across the whole city this was standardised to 5km distance to be ‘fair’. At the broadest scale, other areas of Australia we have had state borders closed and different restrictions on where you can go in the entire country depending on whether you live 2 largest cities, versus a regional country area. 

As to use of Covid to restrict other liberties, reduce privacy protections and many rights, plus be a curtain behind which government can pass and enact other legislation, yes that has happened and is happening too. It has happened more rapidly than otherwise would due to pandemic.

You're fine with 18% of the nation being Muslim one day soon? if so why are you even concerned about any of the terrorist attacks if you're not going to lift a finger to stop the rise of Islam in France? They'll get their way in your ideal society 

&gt;By your logic and the article that you linked, France has been taken over by Americans because american names have risen exponentially, which is blatently not true.

American """"""culture"""""""" certainly has and that's another prime example. 

&gt;Moreover, you are literally saying that we should curtail our own fucking freedoms to fight islam.

What freedom does a French person lose if France expels Muslims?

 &gt;Whats the fucking difference between that and converting to Islam, they are both as bad as each other.

In one you live under the Caliphate and the other you live in a French nation for French people and don't have to worry about offending the feelings of the non-French in France. Seems like a big difference to me 

&gt;You are literally spouting Nazi propaganda with not a hint of self awareness.

Nazism is the only ideology that will actually defend the French people against this foreign population in the land? No wonder more and more people are Nazis today

4637,"I agree w/you on a lot of that, I think it’s incredibly sad when you think about how many countries have destroyed. And I really think we need to seriously pull back on military occupations. I can see how that could make people desperate.

At the same time, bad life circumstances don’t excuse bad behavior and like, even if they excused people being upset or having hate, they definitely don’t excuse murder and terrorist attacks. What happened was vile and inexcusable. There are also a lot of people who are refugees from those countries and who live in those countries that I’m guessing don’t condone the murders/terrorism, and certainly wouldn’t do it themselves because people overall don’t tend to be that actively violent that easily, even when they’ve had hard lives. Especially when you break it down to a specific individual level. Do you really think everyone would condone beheading a 70 year old woman? 


Also, people can have education and tolerance w/o safety to at least some degree. And they can still be capable of not murdering people. Point being, it’s a poor excuse for doing something THIS despicable. 

But I fully agree that there is instability in a lot of Muslim majority countries and it is awful. Some of it I would argue stems from much deeper conflicts, but it’s still really sad and I can’t imagine what it would be like to live in a warzone and w/o having safety.

This often gets brought up in discussions about Turkey and I'm just skeptical of the logic behind the statement in the present day.

The main threat of the Russian navy is their ballistic submarines, which are mostly stationed in their Northern fleet at Polyarny.

And even if Turkey was no longer the bottleneck to access to the Black Sea, the Greek Aegean islands still make for a very narrow space to try and squeeze through undetected.

4692,"&gt; Strong border control isn't fascism and the laws around asylum are outdated. They're not being used in the way they were originally intended. The way it's meant to work is that if there's a war, you can flee to the next nearest safe country and live there for a short time before going back home.

That is all besides the point, the point is that the Aegean border all isn't very well able to be patrolled effectively.

Denying people their right to asylum *is* fascism. The European convention that grants human rights was explicitly designed as a counterpoint to fascism and specifically the refugee section to improve on the mishandling of refugees from fascism like happened in WW2.

&gt;What happens now is that millions of people travel long distances to European countries even though they have safe countries around them. They're doing asylum shopping for the best handouts. The laws as originally intended didn't anticipate that. Most of those people don't even come close to qualifying as refugees, they just claim asylum just so they don't get sent back right away and they have time to drop off the grid and live in Europe forever. There is also no intention of sending any of these people back.

Only a fraction of refugees even reaches Europe, it's a non-problem so far. I do agree that a rejection of the asylum request should be enforced, and I also think there should be no serial asylum request in different European countries in the hope that one sticks, but that all requires more EU coordination, not less. That all happens after the border crossing to boot.

&gt;We need a new set of EU asylum laws that address the problems with the current asylum system. The first of which is that you can only apply at an embassy. Anyone who crosses the border illegally gets instantly sent back, no questions asked. You don't get to cut the queue by walking here.

That makes no sense. They can't reach embassies inside Europe, and embassies outside Europe would turn into flytraps where the local regimes have permanent arrest squads for everyone local citizen trying to enter because they might be trying to flee. Which means actual refugees get arrested and fortune seekers don't.

&gt;As a final thought, I want to point out that this is the dumbest argument that people use over and over. ""I love diversity because I love tacos and kebab."" It's actually a racist argument as well, as though you need to be a certain ethnicity to make a certain type of food. Any person anywhere in the world can cook any type of food they want. You don't need to be Japanese to make good sushi. If you want diverse foods, buy a cookbook. Presto, now you can have kebab without also having beheadings.

4710,"As for random testing, China has shown that it can be effective already, they have tested places with a much bigger population than ours. The man issue with it is that it's easier said than done in a democratic country than in one which is ruled the way China is.

We were doing fine until the summer as we closed our borders early on and Slovaks who were allowed to return home from abroad had to undergo state quarantine where they were tested with PCR tests after 5 days. We also had a high compliance with the social distancing rules and mask wearing during the first wave because seeing the videos from places like Italy scared people \*\*\*\*less given that our healthcare systems is much much worse than the one in Northern Italy even on a good day.

However during the summer most of the restrictions were lifted pretty quickly, there was free travel  between the rest of Europe and into Slovakia. Plenty of people were traveling to Croatia and brought the virus back from holiday. Schools opened in September and even when we started having restrictions again in late September people were still having big weddings across the border in Poland etc. Since the end of September the situation has been getting worse every week. We now already have 1000+ people in hospitals with Covid and around 100 on ventilators and we've reached 200 deaths already (we had under 40 during the first wave).

Compliance with the rules and people's willingness to wear masks and for other measures became much lower as the way the first wave went created a false feeling of security, same as in the Czech republic.

4723,"&gt;**This includes the West’s involvement in the Middle East, as uncomfortable as it is for people to admit it.**.

I don't know why you feel this way because all of these wars have been extremely unpopular on Reddit, especially for non-Americans. People absolutely are aware of the effects these wars have had on the people of the region, but it doesn't excuse the religious extremist that have been far more common in Islam above all others. 9/11 happened before the big US wars that followed. The exact same kind of military interventions have happened in Latin America, Africa and East Asia, but we do NOT see the same kind of religious extremism from there. Even in places where the West have had little to no involvement, Islam finds it very difficult to peaceful coexist with others.

1. This is a real issue, but let's not pretend most Westerner aren't constantly calling out the US for it's support for Saudi Arabia. Also, most of the world uses weapons made in just a few countries since they can't make them domestically. Iran however, does have a large domestic arms industry since the world refuses to sell to them.

2. You say the West is well defined then you give a terribly inaccurate description. Since when is the UN just the West? Russia and China are permanent members of the security council. The US invasion of Iraq was not sanctioned by the UN and even France heavily criticized this war. NATO was the West in the Cold War, but it doesn't include every Western country, yet it includes countries like Turkey. The former Soviet States in NATO were not considered the West before but they are now. It is not well defined. Europe also has a lot of Neutral countries with no colonial past, yet they are lumped in with the US and blamed for problems in the Middle East.

3. Sorry but you are just not correct. The most stable and peaceful Arab countries are still absolute monarchies with religious extremist laws. If anything, these countries would still be living in the 19th century if it wasn't for the oil found by Western companies. Qatar doesn't have terrible human rights because of decisions made in Paris or Washington. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE are all wealthy stable countries with no reason to hate the West, yet they are the main financiers of terrorism targeting the West. 

4. This all happens at a much, much worse scale from Islamic extremists. You can pretend it's not the case, or talk about many years ago, but today, Islam has become much more intolerant of others. In every single Muslim majority country, non-Muslims have less rights and less freedom than their Muslim counterparts. Wherever Muslims are a minority, you see them pushing for Sharia law to be accepted and for special treatment. Nearly every excuse you use to defend them doesn't work when you see how other groups with similar history chose to not go down this path.

People are sick and tired of pretending this isn't Islam's fault. Please pick up a Quran and read the evil you are defending. I used to think like you do now, but I actually lived with someone from Saudi for a while and he gave me a Quran which I read. Those two things showed me that this isn't something to defend or make excuses for.",,/r/europe/comments/jk6x0o/two_dead_in_knife_attack_in_french_church/gald90q/,R-Slash-Username,1604060664

4841,"&gt; Non sequitur as a reaction to two sentences can't be misunderstood if you know what that phrase means.

That is just like your opinion, which is clearly incorrect.

&gt; Is it that hard to admit you got confused for no reason?

It is impossible to admit something that didn't happen.

&gt; You should check again in which thread you're commenting.

Why?

&gt; It's a wrong analogy since the situation falls into very different moral categories.

Again, that's just your opinion.

&gt; Killing someone intentionally (=murder) is way more serious offense than not providing help when needed. This is widely accepted in essentially all cultures and you can see this codified in law too.

It is offense nonetheless. How people regard it for their own comfort doesn't really matter. Either way human is dead because someone else decided that way.

&gt; Why is development level relevant?

Because consciousness is relevant.

&gt; How do you justify that killing a person is preferable against temporary limitation of bodily rights?

Allowing to kill fetus has fewer negative consequences than banning it. It is also consistent with similar cases. It is illegal and immoral to force someone to save/keep someone else alive at expense of one's health/life. It doesn't matter whether someone dies because of lack of transplant or separation from woman's body.

The March 2016 EU-&gt;Turkey 'refugee deal' made for deeper functional cooperation with &gt;material and normative concessions made by the EU.[44]

&gt;In exchange for Turkey's willingness to secure its borders and host &gt;irregular migrants, the EU agreed to resettle, on a 1:1 basis, Syrian &gt;migrants living in Turkey who had qualified for asylum and resettlement &gt;within the EU. The EU further incentivized Turkey to agree to the deal &gt;with a promise of lessening visa restrictions for Turkish citizens and &gt;by offering the Turkish government a payment of roughly six billion &gt;euros.

In front of the government building, large cordons of gendarmes prevented demonstrators from advancing toward the building.[122] From Victory Square, protesters marched to the Interior Ministry, where they knelt and held a moment of silence.[123] The protesters chanted ""shame on you"" and ""assassins"", and carried banners reading ""corruption kills"". By 10 p.m. local time, between 28,000 and 30,000 people[124] (some estimates had more than 35,000) reached Constitution Square, with some protesters scaling the fences surrounding the Palace of the Parliament.

4970,"&gt;An example of why all this is so damn difficult is also currently in the danish media. A man of Moroccan decent Said Mansour, who had received danish citizenship, was twice punished for participating in, supporting and spreading information about terror activities, had his citizenship revoked in 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last year after negotiations with the Moroccan state, who promised that he would not be tortured or sentenced to death, he was sent back to Morocco. According to the Geneva convention, we cannot send anyone back to a country where they can face either torture or a death sentence.  
&gt;  
&gt;Said Mansour has now been judged in Morocco, because of a terror attack in Casablanca in 2003, and sentenced to death. The deal between Morocco and Denmark about Said Mansour is not publicly available, so we do not know what was promised, or how the deal was made. By mouth, on paper or what it was.  
&gt;  
&gt;This event can create problems down the line, because how are we supposed to trust that countries, we normally do not compare ourselves with, keep a deal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also admittedly Morocco has not executed anyone since 1993, but they have also sentenced the three men who murdered the two Scandinavian hikers in the Atlas Mountains to death.

That example is a bad one, because it is totally irrelevant with most of the failed asylum seekers. There are [thousands and thousands of failed asylum seekers](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/jkfuhx/nice_church_attacker_identified_as_21yearold/gakxgmr/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) who are just economic immigrants and they wouldn't face any charges or prosecution or persecution if they were repatriated.",,/r/europe/comments/jkfuhx/nice_church_attacker_identified_as_21yearold/gakz32b/,fed_up_with_politics,1604046684

&amp;#x200B;

As on what to do with the refugees once we accepted them, it would be fairly easy to distribute them evenly across Europe. I know the current majorities do not allow that. I'm still convinced however, if done well, it's not that big of a deal. We can't keep putting so much pressure on Italy/Greece simply for their geographical location. It's not fair.

&amp;#x200B;

Now do I see any of that happen in the near future? Or at all, even? Honestly, no. There's just so many influential groups profiting off of the way it's currently handled, and they're pretty good at staying influential. Future refugees will be climate refugees too and I don't see anyone currently actually even taking any half assed steps to make things better.(I've also read about a study a while ago showing there's a correlation between climate change and Syria's destabilization)

 In a way, with corona going on, we seem to kinda have forgotten about ""that other thing"".

whats more PO not only didnt care about rural areas but in some cases outright sabotaged opurtunities for rural areas to develop, I am talking about via carpathia, highway going from Lithuania, through eastern Poland(least developed region), through slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and eventually ends up in Greek port city of Thessaloniki. Also in Romania there would be fork toward to the Black Sea port town of Constanta.

I would say that this highway can have very important role in the region seeing how it would connect Baltic sea, Black sea and Aegean Sea, it can bring significant investment toward eastern Poland.

So what happen was that someone from eastern poland made a petition to try to get funds from EU for this project, trying to get it added to EU TEN-T(Trans-European Transport Network) and stuff, EU agreed to send someone check viability of this project. so everything was going well but here is where the PO sabotaged it, PO MEP's requested this petition to be closed, claiming that this highway is not needed and that this region is already getting enough money, which is a total BS seeing how its least developed region with highest unemployment. some of those regions are on list of poorest regions in the EU, difference in average wages between west and east Poland can be as big as 1500 PLN.

The most fucked up thing is that it was happening when PO was ruling party, its pretty screwed up when your own goverment is putting effort to keep least developed region of your country from being more developed, they really screwed over people from rural areas here, and now people are wondering why that region dont want to vote for candidate of political party that screwed them over like this...",,/r/europe/comments/jkesjs/protests_in_poland_over_abortion_law_katowice/gakz9tb/,Culaio,1604046897

Their SLBMs have a range that, as best I can tell, could hit Madrid from the *Pacific* coast of Russia if they wanted to.

&gt; The Armenians were not killed because they were Armenian. The Ottoman Empire resettled them from Anatolia to Syria to cut the Russian - Armenian union and the Armenians themselves wanted an Armenian state from Baku to Diyarbekir. 

&gt; They even were a minority in Armenia itself

&gt; This is the reason why many Kurdish tribes joined Ataturk, because they knew that Armenians would genocide them like the Kurds in Lacin and Armenia.

&gt; We don't see ourselves inferior. The problem is that we see ourselves superior. And we have reason to do so. Think my friend. Think about world history. There are so many nations on the earth and most of them don't matter historically. They could disappear and nothing would change. But Turks and Turkic people? The Turkic people stretch from Siberia to Libya, from Poland to India. For the last 2000 years, Turkic people founded several empires (40+), ruled the entire Middle East, Eastern Europe and India for the last thousand years. How many empires did fell in front of us, how many emperors did we create? Do you really think we are inferior? A bunch of stupid barbarians who ruled over your high IQ people for the last 1000 years? **While ethnic Turks have a higher IQ than Greeks, Armenians and Arabic people (I don't want to offend anyone, but Ethnic Turks have a general IQ from 93 to 100, while Armenians, Arabic and Greeks are about 85 to 94.)**

&gt; Erdogan could join an election in any Middle Eastern state and he would win against any native candidate.

5160,"The problems of immigration and the poor in general just show the flaws in our system.

Our education system is collapsing, France is one of the countries with the greatest inequalities between poor and middle-class children.

We no longer know how to teach math or French to children who find themselves with enormous difficulties in high school and university.

So these problems of the system are compensated by the culture and time that middle-class parents give their children to do for example the homework.

Problem, with parents of the poor kids don't have the general culture and time to take good care of their children academically (or don't want to), you add to that the inefficiency of the school system, depression teachers and classes of 30 students, and you have the perfect combo for school failures. Once the school failure arrives, no one helps the student, and he ends up leaving school at 16/18 without a diploma, and then he will either pull himself together and go back to school (rare), or he will go into religious extremism, or he's going to go into crime.

Once his first crimes are done, he will eventually be arrested, he will go to court the same day who will tell him ""it's not right, you have to stop"" and then will be released. Then he's going to get arrested again, he's going to go to court for reoffending and he's going to go to jail for a few months. In prison he's going to be in a cell for initially two people, but with 4 inmates in it because they're not enough cells, and no reintegration program to get out of there, and once out of prison he's going to continue these crimes, and that's the way it is all the time, crime/prison/crime/prison/... 

Crime is directly related to our incompetence and budget problems in education and police/justice. 

So yes, there are also terrorists who are unrecoverable and must be heavily punished, but on the other hand, as long as we do not solve the problems of our public services, the situation in the sensitive areas (and everywhere in France) will continue to deteriorate. Education and the social lift is the only way to limit religious extremism and crime in these neighborhoods.

You should hear how some muslim countries, top politicians talk about killing infidels. How publicly beheafing a teacher is good according to them. They even say, that saying beheading the teacher is wrong, is a reason for boycots, and more.

I have always been open minded and acceptant of other peoples believes.

I am 42 now, and i see i was wrong.
i knew religion is evil. Katholics, and other religions.
But muslim/ islamic leaders saying a man is beheaded because of having a picture if muhammed...
I am sorry, but that is insane beyond my comprehension.

If your ""god"" or prophet, sais you should kill a man, by beheading even, your god obviously is pure satanic evil.
Duh.

By making a concession and creating one of the programs the socialists were saying they'd give people if they were in power. He basically said, ""hey, you don't need them. We can do that ourselves without creating conflict"". And thus the father of european universal healthcare systems was born. 

What I'm saying is the left in Europe need to get their head out of their asses and stop being so scared if looking bad. They're going to let their nation's regress and lose elections if they don't start making concessions in regards to limiting or better controlling immigration and integration.

5250,"Only time will tell, but I think that the U.S. probably had a much bigger and earlier infection than was realized, meaning that the situation was already out of hand before most European countries had any appreciable number of cases (except Italy). The West Coast has very high rates of person exchange with Asia, for example, and the East Coast sees many visitors from Europe too. Testing got off to a very slow start in the U.S., compounding the problems.

So I think that part of why the U.S. wasn't able to bring the rates down like in Europe, is because they were unknowingly behind the curve, in comparison. Arguing against that, however, is that for weeks the U.S. could look to measures taking place in Europe, but did not copy them. 

To me, whether in the U.S. or in Europe, the most shocking and most upsetting thing is how virtually all governments spread the ridiculous idea that ""masks won't help"", ""masks are only for healthcare workers"". I understand the concept of protecting the supply of masks for healthcare workers, but fact is that most governments did not make just that specific point, they went far beyond that and told people specifically not to use masks (even ones they might already have), and lied, saying that masks aren't helpful outside of a hospital environment. What? It's a \*respiratory virus\*. From very early on, it was known that certain clusters resulted from communal singing, for example. In China, a single passenger on a long bus ride infected people sitting on the other side and end of the bus - but passengers wearing masks were not infected. And then, eventually, the tide turned a bit, and masks became part of some government measures - but always in sort of a limited, half-hearted way. And not at work, only in public places, or in shops. Where do people spend most of their time (aside from home)? At work, in close proximity. And once the government started requiring masks, they should have also ramped up efforts to increase the supply of actually effective masks. Sure, an N95/FFP2 mask currently costs around 3 EUR (and that's not even wholesale, so let's say 2 EUR wholesale), but that's still 40-50x less than the cost of a single COVID PCR test. The math at a national level seems simple to me, if you assume that at wholesale a locally produced FFP2 mask costs 2 EUR, and a COVID test costs 120 EUR: instead of testing e.g. 25% of the population (which is the relative # of tests completed in several EU countries to date) for the same total cost you could provide 15 proper masks to every citizen. Of course I'm not saying no tests are needed, just trying to put the costs in proportion. A smarter approach would be to give 5 masks to every citizen (so they can rotate daily and re-use), and conduct 1/3 fewer tests.",,/r/europe/comments/jje8e0/eu_vs_usa_coronavirus_cases/gak9jim/,viennabound,1604025425

5307,"I'm not sure saying ""your religion is poo poo"", say, was the key to the enlightenment.

There's a false assumption that if you are being offensive, you are acting in the true spirit of rationality and whatever else.

But it can be amazingly lacking in intelligent content, just insulting people for the sake of it, and you can continue to insult people without ever having to make any intelligent critique, you can be wrong about their religion in every sense, and that in itself can be offensive.

So given that offensiveness can have zero truth content, and worse, it can make you imagine that you're doing something to stand up for truth and reason, without ever really engaging in consideration of either - Two religions, philosophies, can troll one another by making incorrect statements about one another, without ever saying anything of substance, and just encourage group based antagonism - I would say that it's essentially a form of recreation, the time honoured tradition of shitting on things, and when it's used to reinforce stereotypes about other groups, it can even be part of reinforcing an unreflective attitude on the part of its audience, as you laugh about how stupid all the other people are and how angry saying it will make them.

In my opinion, believing that offensiveness is the mark of enlightenment is like a 19th century man believing that smearing his house with ash and coal dust will keep it warm; offensiveness is a side effect, that can be reduced but not entirely removed, of free discussion and intelligent criticism, not something to be valued in itself.",,/r/europe/comments/jke16h/charlie_hebdo_could_not_exist_in_russia_kremlin/gajv7mm/,eliminating_coasts,1604017491

5309,"&gt;First of all, Stalin's genocides were bigger, deadlier, and in some ways, more cruel than Hitler's.

No they werent...  they were big, but they werent as large as Hitlers. Holochaust alone was huge, not to even mention the attwmpted extermination of Eastern slavs, both of these were larger than Stalins largest, the Soviet Famine of 1932-33.. and that one is debatable, because while true that food was actively taken and then Denied to certain areas, mostly southwest Russia, east Ukraine and Kazakhstan.. it is also true that the food shortage was a very real thing, it was caused in part by incompetence the results of which were not deliberate, and by natural catastrophes which can not be blamed on anyone.. so it's so so, people are devided on this subject on whether it should or should not be called a genocide, peraonally i believe it should be classified as a classicide, since it targeted a very perticular social group of many different ethnic backrounds... 

&gt;Of the close to 100 000 prisoners of war from the western front (and they may have been even more, I've read this jsut about the siege of Stalingrad), some 3000 ever returned. Half of those nearly 100 000 died on the deadly walk to Siberia.

Indeed, with Stalingrad, you have chosen by far the worst from the cases of POW death rates in Soviet captivity (many of whom were already near death before capture). [Here a video by TIK on youtube](https://youtu.be/rS_59PHhO4M) it starts at the 12:10 minute mark. He lists all his sources and is rather thorough in his research.
In case you don't have time to watch, going by the numbers we do have estimates of death of German POWs in Soviet hands came to a total of aproximately 250 thousand which is about 11.5% of the total POWs taken by the Soviets, On the other hand, Germans killed aproximately 3.3 million Soviet POWs, which amounted to about 58% of the tottal they have captured.

About the last point you've made on the impact of Soviet ocupation on Nations... well probably Hungary would have been better off with Germany winning as Hungary wasn't included in Germanies Generalplan OST extermination plan. But also, The Soviet repressions were far less actively enforced after the end of the Stalinist era and the begining of the De-Stalinization era.
East European nations are most definetely worse off due to Soviet repression and ocupation, but at some point, that's no longer an excuse... Nations repressed by tottalitarian governments elswhere have made recoveries, there is no reason the same could not happen for east european nations, there is also the part of most east european nations having a lower starting point in development to begin with when compared to west Europe, many were decades behind in industrialization before the Soviets ever ocupied them, catching up was burdened due to communism, certainly, but they would not have caught up to the same level either way. (Don't know specifically about Hungary thos, so I'll exclude it here), there is a wide variety in how well the nations coped with Sovietization among the formerly ocupied nations, the Czechs and Slovaks for example, seem to be doing very well all things considered.

So then, why would Hungary be so much further burdened by the ghost of the Soviet past than, let's say, The Czechs?",,/r/europe/comments/jk9fnl/russia_to_criminalise_comparing_stalin_to_hitler/gajv82n/,YourLovelyMother,1604017498

Fucking no. Its not the fault of the French people or of Macron. These are victims of terrorism. It is exactly like a domestic abuser's friends saying ""Well, look what you made him do"" after their violent mate slams his wife's head through a wall.

Are you currently boycotting French products? The French boycott which only started after Muslims beheaded a teacher. That sure seems to be what you are saying here for example: 

&gt; I believe the boycotting of French products is in response to the French government not calling this a complete act of terrorism, allowing Islamophobia to brew. It is in response to the attack on the two Muslim women near the Eiffel Tower -- an incident which was downplayed by French media. It is also in response to the consistent lack of freedom being given to those who want to practice Islam in France. Macron's handling of the attack simply became a matter of diplomatic policies.

No dude, it was because of the doodle of the 'prophet'. Which is a stupid thing to boycott over particularly when a teacher has just been beheaded. You should be showing solidarity with the French people, not boycotting them - that is showing solidarity with the be-headers....",,/r/europe/comments/jkjue6/in_solidarity_with_france_heres_my_drawing_of/gajvdix/,SpatInAHat,1604017583

5330,"I'm replying as an American too so I might miss out on some details, but a French teacher showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad which is super offensive to Islam. So some Muslim students ended up beheading them. In return Macron condemned to attack and defended the right of the teacher to show cartoons as it is protected under freedom of speech. Macrons refusal to bend over backwards to allow French society to change it's core values for what is offensive to Islam caused a massive protest and upset with Islamic countries and Muslims worldwide. There are especially rising tensions with Macron and Erdogan of Turkey. Anyways, the Islamic world had mass protests over France, pulled French goods from stores, and are calling to boycott the country entirely. So other EU countries are starting to stand with Macron while Islamic countries come together to condemn the cartoons. More cartoons of Muhammad were projected onto buildings in France just to show they weren't gonna ""back down"" to their expressions and free speech rights. Today, an attacker killed 3 (including an elder French woman) at a church in Nice which is deemed Islamic terrorism probably as a direct result of the events over the last few days.

Which is a stupid thing he lacks the power to do.

&gt;(exactly what you refuse to do against him)

It's not what I refuse to do against him, it's what I refuse to do against innocent poor people who happen to live in the country he rules.

&gt;and threatens us with migrant invasions every three months or so...

Migrants fleeing wars that we in the west started. Who was it that started Iraq? Who was it that funded the rebels in Syria to the point that it became a full-scale war, but not enough that they could actually win? It was us in the west, and we refused to take any of the refugees. Erdogan is an evil, oppressive scumbag, but the way he's dealt with the refugee crisis is infinitely better than what we in Europe have done. Turkey has taken 1.5 million refugees into a country with a population of 90 million. We in the EU took only 1 million into our population of 470 million.

If we gave two shits about the wellbeing of innocent people, that ""migrant invasion"" wouldn't be a threat, if would simply be good people fleeing terrible situations, and us taking some basic human decency and letting them in.

&gt;I'm sure tanking Turkey's economy will do nothing to limit their aggression

Russia's economy has collapsed since we sanctioned them after Crimea. The country is in poverty. And yet Putin lives just as well as before, and Russia continues to wage war in the Donbass, continues to wage war in Syria, and continues to threaten Georgia.

Yes, but that area is up for negotiation. Armenians won't back down from NK though. There were also 300.000 Armenian refugees from Azerbaijani cities after various massacres. Those areas were only occupied due to the necessity of control of those areas, as Azerbaijan was about to starve and freeze the region into submission during the winter of 1992.

&gt;After 28 years they are still unable to return, and after Pashinyan started to back down on Madrid Principles and took a more aggressive approach and started saying stuff like Artsakh is Armenia which is basically working towards the annexation of the whole area.

These are just excuses for the current war. The reality is Azerbaijan felt they had the military power to take the region + they calculated that there largely would be inaction from other countries.

I got this exact comment in 2016, likely from another delusional leftist Canadian.

IF Biden wins, which is unlikely, he will be a disaster. The progressives in the Dem party itself will ridicule him, with the centrists attacking him for any socialist policies. All while the Republicans grow their 45% base with Latinos and Black Americans, who currently support Trump more than any other Republican in history.

The two outcomes are this election is Trump winning and securely a Republican future, or Biden winning and making a total fool of himself, displaying the failure of the Democrats party decision in real time. His corruption is also ENTIRELY legitimate, all of it. The story is real, the evidence proven. Twitter apologized for censoring it as they found no Russian source for the news at all, it's real. You think that isn't going to be HAMMERED if he wins? He will literally be impeached and removed.

Either way, the Republicans win. The growing threat of China, Russia, and Turkey. The growing tensions with Islam. The embarrassment of BLM with constant deluded riots. The Supreme court secured.

The inherent issue of HDI is that it cannot be taken at face value, as it's based on the assumption that everybody within a country share the same standard of living. Which, *obviously*, isn't even remotely the case.

The point of IHDI is precisely to address this problem by factoring in real world disparities, thus providing a more accurate representation of the **actual** living standard of individuals.

Like any other metric, it's not perfect, but it's still better and more accurate than HDI, which is rather barebone and superficial. So I'm not sure why you'd think it's ""stupid"". In any case, it's considered serious enough to be an official metric of the UN and many other organisms.

Everyone who fought in WWII is because they were attacked.
America itself only fought in WWII because the Japanese attacked them and Hitler declared war on them.
We swore neutrality to everything and to only go to war to defend ourselves because we are a tiny nation that can't afford to just go to war when we feel like it, which is also why we have conscription, so that if we are ever attacked, at least every man is a potential soldier. Bear in mind, my country has a population pretty much the same of the city of New York, if our military was voluntary it would be way too small to do anything against any potential threat.

No they aren't, I want peace and prosperity, they want war and murder because they hate freedom and most of all, freedom of speech.
What riled them up this time? A drawing. That's it, that's what provoked the beheadings of four people.
And that's in a country not ruled by them.
I'm simply not willing to sacrifice anything or anyone for a culture that's the complete opposite of mine.
And it's not racism, Islam is not a race, it's a culture and if I remember correctly the one who did the first beheading was white.
For example, I don't have any problems with black people, those who come here often make fine workers.
It's Islamic culture what I have a problem with, because it's literally a culture that calls for the conquest of ""infidels"".

You yourself talked about the nazis, if you disapprove of nazis you don't have any reason to not disapprove of Islam, they are both far right conquering ideologies that seek the destruction of those who do not submit.

5555,"&gt; I know what non sequitur means. How have you managed to interpret it as me not knowing that? 

From your: *I had no idea that you want explanation, let alone what you want explained*

&gt; Issue was you calling my entire comment non sequitur with no further explanation.

That ""entire comment"" were 2 sentences. And ""non sequitur"" was exactly about the relationship between those 2 sentences.

&gt; There are two individuals (woman, fetus), two possible outcomes for each (living or dying) and three outcomes overall (both living, both dying, woman living and fetus dying)

Actually it can be reduced to only 2 (both living, woman living and fetus dying) since abortion in Poland is allowed when woman's health is in risk.

&gt;  risking her health and potentially life in process

Again, not relevant for this discussion since there's not much controversy in allowing abortion for cases where woman's health is in risk.

&gt; She has right to make decisions about her body, including not to carry fetus.

And fetus has a right not to be killed.

&gt; Fetus is incapable of making any decisions.

How is that relevant? Not being capable to make decisions does not imply loss of rights.

&gt; In every other analogous situation rights of one capable of autonomous living and decision making have priority over rights of one who doesn't fulfill either condition.

Obviously after ISIS started becoming massive and rebels losing battle after battle this policy started to cause issues as fighters that entered syria from Turkey rapidly started defecting/joining to ISIS and there wasn't a way for Turkey to make sure which faction are these people wanted to join.

2. For genocide/ethnocide, percentage is more important than the numbers. There were many more Russians than the others, so low % of total were deported during Dekulakization and Decossackization. However, I should mention what is often overlooked - that the standard ~5%-15% of previous elite killed or deported were already taken from the Russians during the Civil War. Any newly conquered territory went through the same process later when the Russians were already broken and ""Sovietized"".

3. Regarding the famine of 1932-1933, yes, it killed even higher % in Kazakhstan due to forced conversion of nomadic people to sedentary farming life plus collectivization. But there were specific orders and documents saying that Ukrainians should not get the famine relief and should not be allowed to leave their villages (""blacklisting"" orders). The Ukrainian farmers were not just accused of being Kulaks as normal, they were accused of being Ukrainian nationalists. Not just farmers themselves, even local Communist officials trying to help them. Go and read the source documents.

5761,"One point I have seen raised regarding the difference is that muslim immigration to the US is usually more skilled and educated, added to the fact that there are smaller numbers of muslims, so there are few, if any, separate muslim communities where fundamentalist views can take root.

Another point I read was about the generally higher numbers of religious people in the US compared to Europe. It might be harder to oppose a country that is actively religious than one that has a more laissez faire approach and where nobody cares about religion until there is a problem.
Or it might be more relatable for a muslim population to grow in a country that at least follows (in large part) another Abrahamic belief, rather than one filled with vocal atheists and apostates.

I don't know if any of these are true, but it might be something to consider.

5765,"I said “... without much concern for economic AND cultural factors” these two things are not mutually exclusive. Let me preface by saying clearly that I have a nuanced opinion on this, but integration would’ve have been relatively more easy if 

1. We would’ve had a job market like the one in the Industrial age, in which unskilled labour was easily hireable. Instead, even being a carpenter today is a semi-academic education. My high school cantine employee was even an engineer from Egypt but couldn’t get his degree accepted

2. If the Arab world would’ve been stable, and if the most extreme groups would not be funded by Saudi oil money (+ Iran and others)

Having a conservative and dogmatic religion has ALSO been a huge problem, because it has created social control and isolated, parallel communities. But one must ask oneself, why hasn’t the Muslim world been successful in having a “reformation” and what would it take to achieve it? 

These are the questions that in the long run will make progress on a grand scale. In the meanwhile, we should have a restrictive immigration policy and an active integration policy which handles the roots of the problems we are seeing in local communities. 

There are a lot of young Muslims with potential that is ruined by both economic disparity, as well as the pressure and control of their own communities.

5795,"What is “so many”? In front of this kind of question, the best thing is to consider numbers.

Muslims in France represent between 6% and 7,5% of the population, according to the sources: see [Thierry Baudasse's answer to Will France become the greatest Muslim country?](https://qr.ae/TUtOSd)

The reason? It’s simple. Because we have colonised in the past some Muslim countries, particularly in North Africa. An important part of the colonisation has taken the form of teaching French, or imposing it, to the local populations. And naturally, people who speaks French want to migrate to France. If you wanna see some figures about migration you can find them here: [Thierry Baudasse's answer to Are there too many foreigners in France?](https://qr.ae/TUtOJ1)

If you take all the countries “*potentially muslim*”, that is all the countries of Africa + Turkey (knowing that a lot of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are Christians, and that the percentage of practicing christians in those countries are very high) it gives roughly half of the migrants (ie, people born abroad) in France, which represent themselves 9% of the population, so it represents 4.5% of the population (all of them are not muslims, because a big part of the Africans are Christians). Now you can tell me, and the “second generation”? The people who have one or both of their parents who was born abroad count as 12% of the population. Let’s imagine that this population has the same structure as the migrants, which means half come from Africa or Turkey, it represents 6% of “second generation” coming from Africa or Turkey. So if I sum up 4,5% plus 6% it gives 10,5%. From which they are not all muslims, because as I said several times, I take here all the Africans, but some of them (in fact, a lot of them) are Christians. So these figures confirm the percentage given by other sources, of 6–7% of muslims. This percentage is probably not going to raise so much as some people might think, as it’s analysed here: [Adrien Lucas Ecoffet's answer to Will France have a Muslim majority by 2050 ?](https://qr.ae/TUtOln)

Anyway, from these 7%, *the overwhelming majority are moderate muslims*, respectful of the laicity, and respectful of the institutions of the Republic. A *very small minority* are tempted by islamism.

The term “Islamism” is rarely found, unless directly attributed to Macron, as though a mere figment of his imagination.

5995,"&gt; This is proposed to be a directive. That means that the member states will have to make laws that comply with it.
&gt; 
&gt; I see no reason why Denmark shouldn't have its existing system handle the directive. That's up to Denmark.

First of all. How much space there is for interpretation and setting own measures depends on the wording of the directive. Doesn't matter if it's a regulation or a directive.

&gt; Whatever Denmark decides, there is no way the ECJ will resolve labor market disputes in Denmark. 6 million Danes can't hog a court that serves 450 million Europeans for their national needs.

Oh yes, the ECJ is very much involved in labour market disputes in MS. This is what the issue is about. Danish labour market actors want sovereignty over labour market regulation.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/jjr3t0/danish_union_threatens_with_demand_for_an_eu/gahemom/,Snaebel,1603974422
