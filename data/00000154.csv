&amp;#x200B;

is again, one of the cornerstones of the 1st Amendment.

50,"&gt; The USSR was actually considered the greatest threat... by China. Communist China literally accused the USSR of being an imperialist world who was surrounding them with military bases. 

Well that's duplicitous. The Sino-Soviet Split meant that China and the USSR had significant tensions, and they were neighbours with a long border and conflicting geopolitical interests. No shit China considered the USSR their biggest threat. The other superpower was halfway around the world and, while they had conflicting interests as well, was hardly as annoying and threatening as the superpower in your background, actively opposing you. They fought a border conflict in the 60s and were completing for political influence and backing of the communist revolutions in not only Asia, but Africa as well. 

&gt; The Chinese-Vietnamese war happened because the Chinese wanted to expel a Soviet military base from Vietnam, and show to the world that the USSR could not defend its allies too

What? Foreign interests wise, the Sino-Vietnamese War's primary cause was the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia which was a strong Chinese ally and because of Vietnam and the USSR's alliance to contain Chinese influence. Beijing also didn't engage in the war with any real plan to conquer or take anything major from Vietnam, having already made contact with the USSR and the US to clarify that it was a limited war. Had China pursued a serious invasion against Vietnam that threatened Vietnamese sovereignty, the USSR would have most likely switched to military aid and engaged.

Because of Red Scare of US, our progressive governments got fucked. Erdoğan was the first candidate who ever visited US before got elected. It wasn't 100% fault of US but they had strong influence over political structure of Turkey in the Cold War. 

Heck when US wanted to invade Iraq the freshly elected AKP government was so into let US to use Turkish soil for whatever they want. Thankfully the act was got rejected by the parliament which was more democratic by then. Guess what happened. Invasion of Iraq fucked up Middle East and now Turkish citizens have to pay taxes to feed Syrians who run from the ultimate results of destabilization caused by the US.

This is a mental illness.

&gt;The first expert, Dr. Daniel Zagury, concluded in September 2017 to a simple alteration of his judgment, considering that his use cannabis in large quantities was ""conscious and voluntary"". In July 2018, Drs Bensussan, Meyer-Buisan and Rouillon had in their turn declared in favor of his criminal irresponsibility, the suspect was, according to them, not aware of ""the potentially inductive effects of a delusion"" of the cannabis use. Last March, the last panel of experts had made a report more convoluted but rather favorable to an abolition of discernment.

277,"You're conflating two different issues: Whether the US is worse morally than China, and whether the US is more of a threat. I won't dispute the former, though their recent backsliding on that front has worsened the latter issue.

To answer your question, it's simple. Use the same realpolitik Americans love to use, when they say that the EU is a greater threat than China, their own actual quote. 

They have too much influence, whether it's political clout with the little far-right demagogues they like to send over among others, or whether it's just pure economic clout. When it comes to the military as well China can't project power towards Europe. The US can. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have my share of personal grievances against the US and some of it's citizens, but if we're being purely pragmatic, the US is far more of a direct threat, and 'values' are all that keeps us safe. Values which can change. One thing that saved the EU when the Americans talked of a trade war against us, was that they than attacked China. A trade war, for the most arbitrary and uneducated reasons. They were able to do that, and no one could stop them. 

You know what would happened otherwise? We would have been \*\*screwed, fucked, damned\*\*. What would you, or I or anyone do than? Beg, and cry out why they're doing this? Let me quote the Machiavelli that so many Americans love to quote as well:

 

\&gt;""Among other evils which *being unarmed* brings you, it causes you to be *despised"".*  


People don't like a nation which can't fight back. Germany was one of the more conciliatory nations versus the US, and what has that brought? Nothing but scorn. The US is a threat as long as they're this powerful, and the many nations of Europe are this weak. Using the words of an American user, otherwise we're just vassals. I can link you to him, if you want.  
They're a threat quite simply as long as they can't be countered. Values don't matter, they're easily discarded as we can see, past doesn't matter, those men are dead. Keep the US as an ally, work for common interests, but don't be deluded that nations don't have permanent allies.

That isn't necessarily a bad thing. The Virginia and North Carolina furniture industry boomed when furniture was made of higher quality hardwoods from the region. Since furniture is now made from MDF areas closer to confier forests are at an advantage. The bust in furniture manufacturing in that region has been ongoing for 30 years due to the same forces. This is not a reaction to any new political or economic pressures.

There are some pine forests in the area, but just look at a world map. Boreal forests from Canada to Sweden to Russia are just so huge and prolific. It's not smart to compete with that.

Nur weil Ursula von der Leyen der CDU, also der Konservative, angehört heißt das noch lange nicht das sie rechstextremistisch ist. Warum sage ich das du rassistisch bist?  
Weil es auch, nach der Definition, rassistisch ist Menschen in Kategorien zu stecken und ihnen bestimmte Eigenschaften zuzusagen.

Was zählt ist doch das Resultat, oder nicht.

Ursula war nun lange Verteidigungsministerin. Und ihre Führungsweise ist wirklich nichts sagend gewesen. Einige Sachen hier und da aber eindeutig nichts was auf Rechtsextremismus hinführt sondern eher in die entgegend gesetzte Richtung.

&amp;#x200B;

Ich hoffe du siehst ein das nicht alles Rechtsextrem ist und viele Sachen aus dem Konservatismus auch den Grünen/Sozialen/Progressiven zustimmt aber generell erstmal logisch vorgeht und das ist auch meiner Meinung nach vollkommen okay.

669,"&gt; You are basically saying that things I disagree with should be deleted, Things I agree with shouldn't.  
&gt;  
&gt;How is that not a circlejerk?  
&gt;  
&gt;For Russians (and in fact all post USSR states) 90s were horrible so horrible in fact that it was a catastrophy. Denying that is stupid that is why your submission was downvoted. But at least it was not removed. And you were free to discuss and express your opinions.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is not something that you'd be allowed to do if you'd shared an unpopular opinion on most other subs. And your requirement of it being opinion you agree with, clearly removes the point of the experiment.

That post wasn't removed, sure, yet I was banned in that forum when I made an anti-western view (they unbanned me after I asked for the reason behind it), so I think this post is more of an exception than the rule. 

Also I am not denying that 90s was a bad time for Russia, I am not forcing my opinion onto anyone. The reason for that post was to see if I can get a proper discussion going and try to show my point of view on why it wasn't a catastrophy. Your stance on this matter ""denying that is StUpId"" is not much better and it is just a prime example of how that entire subreddits comment section looks like.

&gt;And your requirement of it being opinion you agree with, clearly removes the point of the experiment.

This is not about agreeing with a view or disagreeing. You aren't exactly proving your point here by saying that r/Latvia isn't a liberal sub just because they would remove a submission that would praise a war crime. What discussion do you expect from Latvians to get there? There is literally no historian in Latvia who would even entertain the possibility of the deportations not being a war crime. At the same time collapse of the Soviet Union is not universally accepted as a catastrophe in Russia. If you want this experiment to be fair, find a comparable tweet to the one I posted in r/russia.

When the same people also take oaths swearing allegiance to a secret society and pledge to uphold the values or execute the objectives of said secret society, that jeopardises their role in public institutions and democracy itself.

(2) Democracy cannot function without truth and knowledge. That is why a free press is so important, but also why secret societies are not compatible with democracy.

824,"&gt; The only democratic institute is the European Parliament and it has no power apart from rubber stamping suggestions from others.

It can block. It can amend.

It does both.

As an example, GDPR was fundamentally shaped by Parliament.

&gt; Doesn't change the fact that nobody voted for the persons leading the EU.

I don't know what country you are from, but here in Germany, Merkel was elected democratically. So was Macron in France.

So Parliament is elected directly, the Council is elected either directly or indirectly, depending on country. The Commission president is elected indirectly (as we saw yesterday) and the individual commissioners can be blocked by the Parliament.

825,"What are you talking about, *every single* Eu council summit is to convey the general will of the nation states. The passage of the budget is one of the more overt examples of this. The budget defines much of what the commission can even accomplish.

I never asserted that the council has ""formal control"", although it can assert control in indirect ways, veto's, budget, and general realpolitik. I said the council sets the political agenda of the European Union, the comission's role is to enact the agenda of the European Union. It's that simple.

Well that depends on what you define as ""propose it's own things"". The commission comes up with solutions to the political problems and agenda set by the council. The council (and parliament) may not like this, *but this is not unusual for a civil service body*.

Brexit is a prime example of this. The government requests it to 'prepare for no deal', there is very rarely specific requests to look at individual aspects - the request filters through the various departments that semi-independantly assess the problem in relation to their policy area. Recommendations, general policy proposals, and legislation is then proposed. The government and parliament then has the duty of either accepting it or not accepting it.

It equates *safe* abortions for the wealthy only.

[In 2006 the WHO estimated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_abortion#Frequency_by_continent) that, while 97% of unsafe abortions worldwide take place in developing countries, 500000 unsafe abortions are being performed on the European continent per year - roughly 7 unsafe abortions per 100 live births. 

People are welcome to scroll down towards the actual methods that are common once someone has to go that far but it's not exactly pretty.

In the US for example in 1972 (one year before [Roe vs Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade)) an estimated 130000 women attempted self-induced abortions or obtained illegal abortions - resulting in 39 deaths.

&gt;  
&gt;why  
&gt;  
&gt; the EU state leaders are almost unanimously against these changes other than the authoritarian Hungarian leadership? Or is mutual understand a one way street for this new Lithuanian president?

Pretty much yes.

FORMER leaders are aggainst PiS.

**Only countries where liberals retained majority are aggainst Poland.**

No country where powers changed since 2015 is attacking Poland on that matter.

Basaiclally it's France+Germany + Benelux that are most fixated on it.  No one else cares that much.

It's clear political calculation - as PiS opponents are in the same clib current mainstream parties are. It's just buisness and **it's naive to believe that Timmermans/Macron/Juncker - actualluy care for well being of Poles - they just want more votes for their clubs to get more power.**

&amp;#x200B;

And given recent actions ( like Germany building Nord Stream 2 and Macron calling Russia the pillar of European safety) - made it clear that neither France or German current rulling parties work for benefit of Poland. **So their view is simply omitted while making decisions by Poles.**

&amp;#x200B;

From ""PiS supporter"" point of view - we only started thinking for ourselves in 2015.  Before, we simply mindlessly followed instructions. And many would like us to retract to that state.

The people on the left support social welfare, support stronger paternity and maternity laws, and fight against enforced heteronormativity which goes against the family values for many families which do not fit the mold of a super-masculine breadwinning man and a feminine housekeeper woman. People on the left fight for higher wages and shorter work weeks that would allow more quality time to spend with your children. People on the left fight for protecting against climate change which will impact our children more than it will impact our generation. People on the left for mobility, which would allow your children to live their fullest lives - even if it is abroad.

1000,"You are correct that only it can propose legislation, however it is not allowed to set the political agenda. This is the the role of the council (national leaders) and council of ministers (national ministers).

The EU commission simply translates these instructions into legislation (that the two former bodies can veto if they don't like it or feel it aligns with their instructions). This is identical to all national civil services - national politicians rarely if ever actually draft laws themselves, civil servants do it for them. The only difference between the EU commission and national civil services is that the commission can propose legislation directly to the parliament instead if giving it to an MEP or council member to propose after drafting it.

I'm not talking about the individual because this is almost irrelevant (not least because she was chosen by elected national leaders and confirmed by the majority of elected MEPs). Any issue with the appointee is an issue with your elected representatives rather than the EU itself.

The rest of your post is nonsensical ravings. No civil service is elected (not sure what that has to do with the anglosphere). In fact the role of Eu commissioner has far more scrutiny that any other national head of a civil service as the individual has to be confirmed by *TWO* elected bodies (national leaders and MEPs).",,/r/europe/comments/cdoxkx/election_of_the_president_of_the_european/eu0gvr3/,Repli3rd,1563347820

Sounds like a recipe ripe for abuse. Wouldnt be surprised if some authoritarian hellhole like china implemented something like it.


&gt;good cheap widely available public transport.

Pick one of those, two if you're really lucky. Three is basically impossible unless (or even if) you throw unrealistic amounts of moneyat the problem. You cant beat the convenience of personal point to point transportation.

Just for fun I used google maps to see how my daily commute would change by using other methods of transport. For the 10km one way drive to work google says I need about 14 minutes door to door, which is just about right. Some unexpected traffic, bad luck at the lights or poor weather conditions can add another 5 minutes to that trip. This has been accurate for the last 5 years i worked here. 

According to google using public transport would add another 62 minutes to that one way trip (thats if there are no delays and I hit all 3 transfers on time). Walking another 10 minutes on top of that. There was no option for bike, but I'll estimate it would add anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes to the cars time, depending on which path I could take and obviously weather conditions. All three are frankly a miserable way to start or end a day at work. On the other hand my car works great in all weather, has comfortable heated or chilled seats, a banging stereo, no smelly strangers sitting next to me carrying various seasonal diseases, and it gets me home to my family significantly faster than any other mode of transport. You cant beat that level of convenience, I dont care how much tax money you throw at it.

Deng was threatening Thatcher with invading if the British didn't agree to turn it over. And it wasn't an idle threat. It would have been insane to not strike a deal.

I'm not saying the West should just roll over for China by any means. However, this mentality that the EU and the US are going to be able to impose their will on matters like these is naive imo. We should be strong, but there's going to be compromise. And issues like these I think are not realistic on holding the line on over the next 50 years.

I think focusing on things like technology transfers and fairer trade are more pragmatic goals as well as more beneficial for our citizens.

1162,"Well technically its about creating administrative zones with similar conditions in the number of inhabitans or economic power, so that a federalized Europe can be achieved without any one region dominating the rest. Its to create autonomous regions that are part of a European state, similar to states of the USA (depending on the model). This would define what is business of the european government and what  a ""state"" can decide for itself. Different laws for different cultures and regions, but all clearly defined under a european democracy, so that people can live how they want, without fear of beeing assimilated into one dominant culture, but with a bigger picture of how one region of europe can influence another. This would also serve to either diversify the european council or to get rid of it entirely.

As I said, the already existing autonomous regions of the member states could be used (probably with some adjustments) or you could just divide the already existing borders of the member states into smaller parts, that are more equal to a european population or economic standart. Both would still serve to keep the cultural borders intact. Of course there are no lines like that drawn yet, but I imagine that this could still be decided somewhat democraticly, by the people.",,/r/europe/comments/ce08u1/ursula_von_der_leyen_approved_as_president_of_the/eu06v8g/,TheNewMillennium,1563342795

* independently of the above, hundreds of millions of Euros paid each year from the state and regions to the churches (i.e. even as a taxpayer who isn't a member in a religious club, some of your tax money goes to those religions).
* restrictions on dancing on some religious holidays (e.g. it's illegal to dance in public on good friday)
* shady shit happening with the financing of schools, kindergardens, hospitals etc. operated by churches (the religious propagandists like to pretend that their religions are helping people in need… but the truth is that that is all paid by the state… AND that many of those religion-operated institutions are very intransparent about where the money actually goes)

1249,"As other redditors have pointed out, the national poverty lines of countries vary, based on their respective social and economic circumstances. Or, to quote the World Bank: 

""Due to differences in estimation methodologies and poverty lines, estimates should not be compared across countries""

""National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies""

Having said that, if you'd cherry picked the World Bank poverty data instead you would see the percentage below the poverty line is 25.5% for Serbia, 25.4% for Romania and 19.5% for Croatia.

Thing about Germany is that given how short our summers are when compared to other countries, we do have a lot of festivals scheduled in a very short time.

In fact, any excuse is good enough to have one. So some ruins and nice weather will do nicely.

Just be advised that a lot of times those ""ruins"" may just be a left-over wall or a castle which just needs a paint-job.

Also, castles can be rather small. So don't expect GoT-type of ancient medieval monuments.

IMHO the highest density of ruins you will find are in the Schwäbische Alb. Basically every hill seems to have one.

1387,"The UK is not obliged to respect their commitments to the running the EU budget. But Article 50 doesn't grant the UK the right to walk away from their commitments, nor does it require the member states to ignore such a move. It just says that the treaties will cease to apply at the end of the transition period or in a no deal scenario. The UK can absolutely walk away from their commitments, and the remaining member states have every right to be angry about it and us that against the UK in possible future trade talks (or outright deny any trade talks until that matter is settled). 


&gt; It suggests that the future relationship should be part of A50 negotiations, the decision to split negotiations was made by the EU negotiation team as it would increase the EU leverage, it wasn't a requirement of the treaty's. 

No, the article says ""taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union"". It doesn't not say that the parties are supposed to negotiate a trade agreement. That would also be quite stupid as trade agreements take much longer to negotiate than just two years, and the UK should be happy that it doesn't work like that because the tight deadline under Article 50 would be a very, very strong leverage for the EU.


&gt; The UK has already negotiated and signed FTA with the the Iceland Norway, Switzerland and South Korea and a bunch of smaller country's, its currently in negotiations with the US and Japan.

No, the UK has rolled over trade agreements from the EU. That's like like applying a snapchat filter and calling yourself an artist. The actual work has been done by other parties. Furthermore these trade agreements come with severe limitations (like exports to these countries are not allowed to leave these countries again) and are only meant to be transitional so that trade doesn't become immediately impossible (and again the UK should be happy about that as these trade agreements were designed and tailored for the EU). Japan and Canada also aren't even playing along because they are wary of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, and because they expect significant concessions from the UK. Oh, and the UK is not in negotations with the US. Kissing Trump's orange butt are not negotations. The Senate has been quite clear about what they expect before trade talks might even start.

The UK is not in talks about actual trade agreements yet. They are only talking about transitional solutions, and they are not even good at that as they have only rolled over a fraction of the 70+ trade agreements they have access to. Three months left to get the job done. What about another extension?

Anyway, the UK will have trade agreements eventually, no doubt about that. The thing that the Brexiteers don't mention though are the terms of these trade agreements. But I guess a trade agreement is a trade agreement, even if you have to allow Donald Trump to waltz through the NHS.


&gt; The EU isn't going to give the UK something for nothing out of the goodness of its heart. Why do you expect the UK to?

Yes, you give something, you get something. Usually you give tariffs for tariffs or something like that. What you don't do is to tell your desired trading partner to ""give you favorable deal or else they will never see their money!"" or ""give us access to the single market or else we create a problem for you in Ireland!"".


&gt; Who is no one, people on twitter? or do you have an actual expert willing to put there name behind the statement,

Funny how ""expert"" is suddenly not a dirty word anymore when it suits an argument. Anyway, the European Commission, the governments and other bodies of both Irish countries, and the industries in the Irish countries are not convinced that smart borders would work. And if you want to hear names, I mention [Dr. mark Maguire](https://www.transportsecurityworld.com/how-technology-alone-cannot-deliver-a-frictionless-northern-ireland-ireland-border) as a substitute for all IT-experts that have declared smart borders as pure nonsense. More importantly though and contrary to what the Brexiteers might have made you believe smart borders do not remove all friction. They make some movements easier to track, but not under all circumstances, most notably when you have mixed collections of goods or people on a vehicle.


&gt; Norway is outside the EU customs union and many of its industry's like agriculture (which causes the most issues in terms of border checks) are not in the single market ether.

Russia is backward. You have population of 146M. USA has population of 320M. USA produced about \~578.000 patents in 2014. Russia produced \~40.000. Russia has half of USA population and yet it produced less than 10% of USA numbers.

She's capable of having a normal conversation on TV without constantly repeating talking points or changing the topic. Reports of her corruption are, in my personal opinion, exaggerated. I don't think 

It's true she wasn't the most successful minister and some of her positions on internet and digital policy are BAD (like most European conservative's) but she is much, much better than Manfred Weber, the original conservative Spitzenkandidat. VdL is one of the most reasonable voices in her party.

She's an absolute ""Merkel conservative"" despite being the daughter of the late Ernst Albrecht, a very right-wing CDU politician who was prime minister of Lower Saxony (the state bordering Holland to the north) in the 70s I believe. 

She's proficient in multiple languages which is a very good quality to have in that position. Let's be real here, most of us don't vote conservative, don't support conservatives policies – we will likely be angry at a significant number of her proposals. By the way, Frans Timmermans was a big supporter of the copyright law when he was Commission vice president.

Personally I think vdL will be a better Commission President than Juncker. She's much less abrasive, less well-known and hated (Juncker was the epitome of EU elite..), she speaks better English and she's better at PR in general. Now her policies – who knows – but I'm cautiously optimistic from a realist's point of view. I was never a fan of Spitzenkandidaten (which I think is not very democratic at all, seeing as there was essentially no real policy debate between them, it's faux democracy).

Also I'm not sure where I said anything about you, or anyone who doesn't support an unified EU army, being against the EU by default? Sorry if that came off as such.

&gt;Yes, because there is nothing less concerning than somebody getting to  decide how 28 countries go to war, that totally won't result in  countries whose public do not want them to enter a war, getting dragged  into one.

Give the EU the power structure that current countries have and it's too complicated and bureaucratic, give it a simpler structure and it's ""somebody getting to decide how 28 countries go to war""; maybe we can find a mid ground somewhere? Yes there should obviously be multiple people in charge of the military and not just a single omnipotent one, but then people don't get to use the ""useless army because of bureaucracy""-line because it seems to work fine in countries- big and small.

1592,"I completely get where you're coming from. One of the saddest things during the usual discussions about the EU in general is that most people love to blame it for the very things it was set up to deal with in the first place.

Trying to harmonise, coordinate and maybe integrate two dozen states, most of which have spent the last thousand years warring each other or conspiring with each other to screw over the others whom they weren't conspiring with is one of the most monstrous tasks on the planet, and whinging about ""too much paperwork"" and an alleged bloated bureaucracy is the most petty criticism imaginable. An epic papertrail is exactly what you get when you try to do it regardless *without* resorting to force.

Sorry for going off at a tangent.

&gt; Although I suppose on the plus side, it'd look pretty shit if Germany made a request and either immunity wasn't waived or VdL didn't volunteer..

I'd respectfully offer another perspective: Would you say that it's a wise and proper move to call in the chief executive of some 460 million people and hole her up for weeks and months because of a few possibly misspent quid in Berlin?

I'm not exactly suspect of being an adoring fan of her's and neither am I trying to diminish her responsibility in the scandal, but even I say that with her recent election to the presidency of the commission, she's got more important things to do. 

I think the view in Berlin will be the same, before long. Parliament will be in recess during the summer; so nothing will happen in any event. If they come back from vacation and call her in, they'll come off as petty. 

They'll either bury the whole thing and find another low-profile pawn to take the bullet in her stead; or [AKK was handed the defence ministry](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ce278v/cdu_leader_annegret_krampkarrenbauer_becomes_new/) precisely to take her out by letting her bite the dust.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/ce08u1/ursula_von_der_leyen_approved_as_president_of_the/ety3zd1/,ColourFox,1563312717

Regarding her carbon neutrality goal by 2050, I really don‘t know what to make out of the whole climate debate for several reasons:

1.	is that scientists have been saying we need to act *now* or we‘re fucked since what, the 70‘s? The ""deadline"" has been moved and moved and moved further into the future and we‘re still all here. I’m not saying climate change isn’t real, scientists say it is so I have to believe that. Even if it *weren’t* real I would still support focusing more on the environment. My electionics use little energy, my lights are all LED, I don‘t own a car, last time I was on a plane was 6 years ago and I go everywhere by foot or bike so I do care about the environment but to be honest climate isn‘t my main concern.
2.	I just don‘t think that her goal is realistic anyway. Especially not if the whole world would need to do the same and if that would need to happen by 2035 like you said. It‘s just not going to happen.

1729,"&gt; you still have to explain to people like me why we, the taxpayers, should throw huge amounts of money at a somewhat outdated technology and its possible implementation one or two decades from now when we could use the same money to go after the real deal, which is called ""renewables + fusion power + smart grids"".



&gt;the real deal, which is called ""renewables

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_Solar_Farm

550MW (when the sun is shining) for 2.5 billion dollars. They used thin-film cadmium telluride PV panels which are far cheaper than silicon.

The Kinder Morgan Power Plant a natural gas power plant which is 564 MW cost $250 million.

The last estimate I showed that we would need 29,300 Topaz Solar Farms to meet the energy requirements of the USA, and that figure comes out to be 73 trillion USD.  

This also doesn't factor in battery storage or transmission power lines. 


&gt;the real deal, which is called .. fusion power

Right now we cannot get an energy return on energy invested in fusion,  this means we can fuse together atoms, but we spend more energy to do it than the process generates.    If and when we will ever be able to get an energy return on energy invested from fusion remains to be seen.

&gt;the real deal, which is called  ... smart grids

Battery storage is insanely expensive. 



&gt;people like me why we, the taxpayers, should throw huge amounts of money at a somewhat outdated technology and its possible implementation one or two decades from now 

I am not against concentrated solar power with molten salt storage (other than it fries birds),  however even with subsidies it costs 13.5 centers per kilowatt hour, whereas LFTR would be 3 cents per killowatt hour.  

LFTRs offer most all the benefits of fusion power, virtually unlimited fuel, impossible to melt down, and thousands of times less transuranic waste.

LFTRs produce thousands of times less transuranic waste (which requires 10,000 year containment), fully 1/3rd of a LFTRs waste stream are components which can be separated and sold to the scientific and medical communities, and are in very high demand. The very small amount of waste they do generate can easily be encapsulated in glass and placed at the bottom of the Marianas Trench where in a few hundred years it returns to the baseline radioactivity from the ore it came from.

LFTRs really do provide most of the benefits of fusion from a technology we proved viable more than 50 years ago.



""LFTR produces electricity cheaper than from coal Small, modular LFTRs can be factory-produced. Capital costs for LFTR electric power plants can be about $2/watt. Recovering capital expenses will cost about 2 cents per kWh for a plant operating 90% of the time with money borrowed at 8%. Thorium fuel cost is insignificant compared to coal costs. LFTR can produce power at about $0.03/kWh, cheaper than coal.""

1759,"&gt; Did islands become a problem after that agreement? I don't think so. 

The ENTIRE thing about the Aegean Dispute is the 6 n.m -&gt; 12 n.m converstion which derives from that agreement. Seriously what did you have in mind? 

&gt; Who cares about what's fair or no? We are fine with previous agreements, don't like the new one so we don't sign it. 

You apparently. But ok. Let's not go by what's fair. Shall we go by the thing that was made to solve those issues which ALSO says that Greece has that right? Cause honestly, i'm not sure if you can see it or not but right now you're acting like a child that is being told something reasonable and it crosses its arms and screams ""I DON'T CARE!"". You don't care about what's fair, you don't care about the international law.. basically and quite literally you only care about what benefits you? The new agreement is treated as customary law. Ebven if you don't sign it you're expected to follow it kinda like the Geneva Convention. If you don't sign it but you commit a genocide, others WILL sanction you to oblivion regardless of your signature or the lack of it. You can't walk out of it by saying ""i didn't promise i wouldn't massacre an entire country so i'm good"". It's sad that you condone such a behavior but i know that Turks have a really hard time accepting when they're wrong.

&gt; Not 71, like I said 91, not going to happen. 

I was refering to your "" If the territorial waters of the two countries were brought to 12 n miles, 71.5 per cent of the Aegean Sea would be under Greek sovereignty "" quote but whatever.

&gt; And what entire world do about it? Nothing? Then who cares? I prefer natural gas instead of praise from rest of the world. 

Good for you! At least you're starting being honest with yourself.

&gt; You were saying Turkey wouldn't lose much because of that agreement and now you say it's fair. Well, how about no? We can sail wherever we want in Aegean and you can't do anything about it. Ofcourse you can ask help from EU and they can cut few more millions of aid. 

Well if you're going to resort to fake muscle flexing, basically we could just expand to 12 n. miles by ourselves since everyone recognizes our right to do that and see what you will do about it. You could declare war but.. hmm.. i'm not sure that would be a great outcome for you. Turkey might be stronger but it's not THAT much stronger to declare war on a EU and NATO member without sweating. We still have a pretty sizeable army for our size. Even if you won, you'd be literally crippled and that's without anyone else supporting us. Now considering that declaring war on another NATO member especially when you don't even have the law on your side, makes you the aggressor, i'm willing to bet that there are a few other nations that would do more than just slap you with sanctions. But even if it was only sanctions they would fuck you up to oblivion. Turkey wouldn't go to war when it's cornered with no one supporting it. 

So yeah there are things we can do. The difference is that unlike you, we're not using our army to bully our way out of problems. We've invited Turkey to meet us in international court but it refuses to. So take pride in your fucked up neo-Ottomanism mentality and see how far it gets you in the modern world.

&gt; You probably know these guys right? So what about international laws, where are the sanctions for a guy who killed civilians and rules a country without an election. See, you don't care about those too when it aligns to your interest. You shake hands with a murderer dictator. 

Take your case to the UN or w/e and i will support you. But of course two wrongs don't make one right. The fact that Egypt didn't get sanctioned doesn't mean that Turkey can just violate another country's EEZ and get away with whataboutism. Politicians shake all kinds of hands. Our PM's have also shaken hands with Erdogan. Erdogan has shaken hands with Putin. What's your point?

&gt; In the end nobody gives a fuck about international laws and don't expect EU to save you from Turkey.  

I mean i can see how that'd be so convenient for someone from an ogre country with a bully mentality but it's not quite like that. And don't worry we can save ourselves too. We just happen to not be war-mongers like you and we choose diplomacy first.

1884,"&gt; So why won't the EU simply add an explicit exit clause to the agreement if as you say it wouldn't make the slightest bit of difference?

Because it is not necessary. You could as well give yourself written permission to have pizza for lunch. It's completely pointless. Of course you can have pizza for lunch if that's what you want, and the UK could just walk away from the withdrawal agreement if they are okay with the consequence. Again, where is that instance above that could punish the UK for such a move? There is none. No court that could say ""... but you have to!"". Stop ignoring that point and stop sending me through the same loop over and over again. Just answer a very simple question: Who are what could punish the UK for leaving the withdrawal agreement, and why would they need a permission if their intention is to have a no deal Brexit and fuck all permissions and agreements?


&gt; given this issue has been threatening to collapse talks for almost 2 years now why would the EU refuse?

The talks have already collapsed. Don't delude yourself to believe that the UK is still negotiating and haggling with the UK. The only remaining question is if the UK will ever find the strength to actually deliver Brexit. And the UK did not ask for an exit from the wthdrawal agreement. They asked for an unilateral and unconditional exit from the backstop while keeping the rest of the withdrawal agreement. Don't fool yourself or others into thinking that this is not about cherry picking.


&gt; The UK can leave with no-deal and ireland could put up a 20 foot high wall along the border that doesn't break the GFA, nether Ireland or the UK have committed to keeping an open border that wasn't part of the agreement. 

Then tell that to the people in the Irish countries.


&gt; Well of course the EU treaty make explicitly clear that the UK is not required to continue paying into the EU budget after the two year notice period of A50, the EU managed to get the UK to agree to continue those payments as part of the transition period in the WA. 

Of course the UK would not have to pay into the budgest after they leave, but they are fully expected to fulfill their commitment to the running budget plan (which will end in 2021). And the EU27 have already lowered the bill.

What is your match plan here by the way? First fuck the Irish countries, then expect to the EU27 to pay the bill, and then approach the EU27 for a ""Britannia first"" trade deal?



&gt; If its no-deal the UK doesn't get a transition period the EU doesn't get anything beyond what the UK is legally required to pay under the EU treaty's.

No, the EU gets nothing. That's the whole point of no deal. Nothing gets resolved and no one gets anything. The EU treaties won't apply anymore in a no deal. Every agreement between the EU and UK will cease to apply in a no deal and the UK will lose all trade agreements that is with the world.

You also mentioned that in order to respect the GFA the UK decided on UK-wide backstop. That is a lie. In order to respect the GFA a sea border with Ireland would have been enough.

Also the backstop only comes into effect if there is no solution to the border problem. Why is everyone arguing about the hypothetical and ignoring the very real need for some kind of border between two different trading countries? the back stop only matters if they can't find a solution to the border issue.

2033,"&gt; which aimed for one million green vehicles on the roads by 2030.

This is where I keep biting my upper lip when it comes to e mobility.

Some professions need vehicles. Transportation and distribution, service companies, the police, ambulances, firefighters. People in working in agriculture and generally just living in the countryside may as well.

But does suburbia need cars? Or people living in the inner cities? It seems the paths travelled each day and the quality of infrastructure would make public transport or bicycles absolutely acceptable for 95% of people (an arbitrary number, but really, it's the majority). The Danish should know it best, looking at Copenhagen.

An electric vehicle is way better than a combustion engine vehicle, but it still isn't environmentally neutral in any case. It will never be. Even if battery chemistry improves, building a car costs resources that have to be extracted, finite resources. It costs energy, energy which isn't going to be 100% renewable on a global supply chain in the next ten or twenty years. Every car on the road was a source of emissions and environmental damage. 

So shouldn't the goal be rather not to replace one to one all combustion engine vehicles on the roads today? Individual transport, especially if the car is only used to transport one person most of the time is just inefficient by concept looking at mass transport options. It is time to say what should have been said in the 1920s already - that individual car ownership for most people is a harmful luxury and not a vital necessity.

So:

* a) we play a game of blocking all non-EP candidates (which I doubt the EP is unified enough to do so) or we 
* b) take a candidate the Council proposes who promises reform on that front to get elected.

The worst possible outcome is her not getting elected and the Council pushing someone afterwards who isn't a big name and who won't make necessary promises - but who will win because they're not vdL.

https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/06/xi-jinping-explains-his-political.html?m=1

&gt;Xi:

&gt;Facts have repeatedly told us that Marx and Engels’ analysis of the basic contradictions in capitalist society is not outdated, nor is the historical materialist view that capitalism is bound to die out and socialism is bound to win. This is an inevitable trend in social and historical development. But the road is tortuous. The eventual demise of capitalism and the ultimate victory of socialism will require a long historical process to reach completion. In the meantime, we must have a deep appreciation for capitalism’s ability to self-correct, and a full, objective assessment of the real long-term advantages that the developed Western nations have in the economic, technological, and military spheres. Then we must diligently prepare for a long period of cooperation and of conflict between these two social systems in each of these domains.

​

&gt;For a fairly long time yet, socialism in its primary stage will exist alongside a more productive and developed capitalist system. In this long period of cooperation and conflict, socialism must learn from the boons that capitalism has brought to civilization. We must face the reality that people will use the strengths of developed, Western countries to denounce our country’s socialist development. Here we must have a great strategic determination, resolutely rejecting all false arguments that we should abandon socialism. We must consciously correct the various ideas that do not accord with our current stage. Most importantly, we must concentrate our efforts on bettering our own affairs, continually broadening our comprehensive national power, improving the lives of our people, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and laying the foundation for a future where we will win the initiative and have the dominant position.



https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-28/xi-jinping-s-plan-for-china-to-dominate-the-world



everything china does is carefully crafted to dominate the future, from its companies with rotating CEOs from the CCP, the assured survival if they can provide critical infrastructure, the forced focussed eye on strategic supply chain domination, key natural resources, key R&amp;D, they dont do it because they are nice to their people. they want to bend the world to their will, as all powerful countries want.

but china is a dictatorship with no regards to human rights, compromise or any decency. 

from state owned markets for organ trade, to prostitution, concentration camps from miniorities (the biggest since WW2 in terms of numbers), spying, IP theft, political pressure, prepping up dictators around the world, being cozy with russia (see venezuela, joint military exercises (biggest in the world), putin and xi calling themselves ""best friends"", debt traps, flooding countries with cheap goods so they need to buy rather produce themselves, building the HQ of the newly formed African Union (African equivalent of the EU) - and bugging it so everything said in there gets delivered to china, bribing up smaller countries, vetoing everything what forces countries to have higher living standards of their own people, bribing politicians to align them with china, pressuring and break into scholars critizing their regime (as with the new zealand scholar about china affairs), asserting campaigns to bend the political will of other countries and their population, threaten Taiwan to annex it by force, building an army around this goal, building also an army and blue water navy to dominate the seas, drawing lines on the map and think this is how it should be regardless of international law (9 dash line which is ridiculous), prepping up an ""alternative to the west"" and creating a new ""world bank"", stating its a developing country and simulatinously creating a Bank for developing countries as alternative to the IMF, ... the list goes on and on and on

china is a bad country and the western thought that if china prospers it will automatically be a responsible country failed, Taiwan is what china could be and this country must and will be contained. and it is not certain the 21st century belongs to china, not by a long shot, it has so much internal troubles and problems, from having too less water, too many old people (it can be the first nation to grow old before it becomes rich), too much debt, too much of control of its people which degenerates innovation (i mean, what product is entirely thought of and produced in china which you can buy all over the world?) ..",Europe,/r/europe/comments/cds42e/huawei_to_invest_31_billion_in_italy_add_1000/etwgjow/,MoustacheAmbassadeur,1563269308

2241,"&gt; 1-Alt right wasnt invented by richard spencer but hilary clinton.

Lies, lies and more lies. But as usual, nothing less is expected.  

&gt; Spencer created the term ""alt-right"", which he considers a movement based on ""white identity"".  - [wiki source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer#cite_note-NYTimes-AltRight-HeilVictory-20162-9)    

_________________  

&gt; Richard Spencer, the white nationalist who came up with the term “alt-right,” described the movement in December as “an ideology around identity, European identity.”  - [the new yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real)  

_________________  
&gt; 2-Spencer is a nobody.

More manipulative bullshit, again, as expected. Fascistoids will lie, cheat and manipulate every step of the fucking way. Truth, values, morals, etc, none of that shit matters to them, all that matters is power  and once they get it, we've seen what happens.  
Spencer was the leader of the alt-right, until he revealed too much of his ""power level"", as the nazis put it.  

&gt; By the time Richard B. Spencer, the leading ideologue of the alt-right movement and the final speaker of the night, rose to address a gathering of his followers on Saturday, the crowd was restless.  

but then  

&gt; He railed against Jews and, with a smile, quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German. America, he said, belonged to white people, whom he called the “children of the sun,” a race of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but now, in the era of President-elect Donald J. Trump, were “awakening to their own identity.”  

&gt; As he finished, several audience members had their arms outstretched in a Nazi salute. Mr. Spencer called out: “Hail Trump! Hail our people!” and then, “Hail victory!” — the English translation of the Nazi exhortation “Sieg Heil!” The room shouted back.   


Oooooppsiiiee. Guess Spencer revealed too much too soon, huh?   


&gt;  i can understand why crosses make you mad now.

Funny considering that I'm wearing one around my neck. But go off, spencer-defending-totally-not-a-fascistoid, try and manipulate others into believing your rancid bullshit.

But they still statistically commit more crime than the average German citizen that age, so they inherently do stand out. 

&gt;They have social deprivation, they are alone and they spend most of their time with other people suffering from these risk factors - the accommodation of the majority of asylum seekers is like refugee camps with little privacy, which again can add to the likelihood of committing crimes.""

4) Based on the information he had the most probable cause was a ground-air missile.

5) The first interview was conducted within two weeks of the tragedy.

In that regard there was a lot of obfuscation in the Western media, because many websites (including some Germans to which he gave interviews directly) published partial quotes (for example, only part when he said that it is highly improbable and that is was likely a ground-air missile) and also lots of ""experts"" quoted Wikipedia data of 5km maximum operational altitude.

2262,"&gt; Still christianity though.

Not the same religion and that is the point.

&gt; The local religion just got infused with Christianity. Hardly any of the traditions changed. I don't see where the death is exactly. It just changed. If you really want to split hairs then Romuva was never dead because it's a neologism from a different meaning word. I don't see how shedding christian motifs from traditions that predate Christinity is seen as something radically different from what it was before christianity popped up in this part of the world.

Bullshit

&gt; English doesn't sound like it did 2000 years ago. Still English.

Just shows how knowledgeable you are of the issue, claiming English is 2000 year old.

&gt;Same with Romuva. It wasn't called that 2000 years ago but it's still what's practiced even if to a lesser extent. Just because  christians claimed christmas as a christian thing doesnt make it so.

2000 years ago you had a proto-Baltic religion at best. The fact is that Romuva is not the same religion as it was then and as it was in the 15th century.

&gt;Yes, it would still be Latin.

And Lithuanian is still Proto-Indoeuropean.

&gt;Did Portuguese stop existing once the word ''internet'' was introduced to the language? Is it neoportuguese now?

Internet is a neologism. And aren't talking about the introduction of a single word/traditions but many that make it the previous language unrecognizable.

&gt; It seems I was right to bring up what I did with my initial comment. That's beyond a silly arguement. Are you suddenly a new person when you remove your wisdom teeth or get a haircut? That is such a moot point.

Shouldn't be surprised by idiotic arguments from you.

&gt;Look, for the sake of arguement I'll agree that Romuva is not 100% the same thing what Lithuanians practiced a millennia ago.

Well, finally some sense.

&gt;Either all religions are valid or none of them are.

None sure what validity do you expect. A pat in the back and the words your stupid belief matters?

&gt;I personally prefer the latter. 

Don't care.

&gt;And following your logic I'm speaking to a new person everytime you make a new comment because the atoms that make you you are not 100% the same everytime you reply.

If you followed my logic, you'd still be talking to the same person, as the atoms are replaced in a continuum. It wouldn't be a different person if I was assembled anew by some teleportation device, as the break was then clear. Your point really highlights how little you understood of the logic. And This is why you find it ridiculous.

&gt; On whose authority are you claiming that the traditions of Lithuanians are not the same or nearly the same of what they were in the 16th century?

On whose authority are you claiming they are?

And if Russia wanted to actually go that, she'd have all the missiles she wanted to do that, given that she's got an inventory of what both Su-25s and MiG-29s fire.  She didn't.

2367,"In 2016, 5.1 million persons died in the European Union (EU), some 80 000 less than in the previous year. One third of these deaths occurred to people aged less than 75 (1.7 million, 33%), whilst 1.5 million people died between the ages of 75 and 85 (29%) in 2016. 1.9 million deaths concerned people aged 85 and over (38%).

Heart attacks, strokes, cancer: main causes of deaths in the EU

Slightly over 1.8 million people died from diseases of the circulatory system (mainly heart attacks and strokes), while 1.3 million died from cancer in 2016. These were the two main causes of deaths in the EU, responsible for 36% and 26% of all deaths respectively. Diseases of the circulatory system were the main cause of deaths in all EU Member States, except in Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom where cancer was the main killer.

The third main cause of death in the EU was diseases of the respiratory system, which killed 422 000 persons in 2016 (8% of all deaths in the EU).

A significant share of deaths in the EU were also due to accidents and other external causes of deaths (237 000 deaths, 5% of all deaths in the EU), diseases of the digestive system (222 000 deaths, 4%), mental and behavioural diseases such as dementia (220 000 deaths, 4%) and diseases of the nervous system including Alzheimer’s (219 000 deaths, 4%).

Death rate highest in Bulgaria, lowest in Spain

To make a sound comparison between countries, the absolute numbers of deaths across Member States need to be adjusted to the size and structure of the population.

With 1 602 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, Bulgaria had the highest death rate in the EU in 2016. It was followed by Latvia and Romania (both 1 476), Lithuania (1 455) and Hungary (1 425).

At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest death rate across the EU Member States was recorded in Spain (829 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants), ahead of France (838), Italy (843), Malta (882), Luxembourg (905) and Sweden (913).

Now, models are tools that allows us the understand phenomenons in the nature and the short term or long term scenarios. It's actually what also other fields do, like economics. Anyway, the thing is, there isn't a consensus or a single tool that is used for modelling, and there were several approaches to model its key aspects. Climate system is complex you know, and human made effects are making it more complex, let alone some direct results can also have their own effects on the system.

Now, the ones you were hearing were mostly the best-case scenario models, and of course the more positive models. Yet, it turns out that models with higher estimates are the ones that predicted the changes most accurately. With the turned out to be more accurate models being used, and with new calculations and studies, things started to look more grim. Keep in mind that, lower estimations and higher estimations are still not that close, although numbers are now tend to be estimated larger than the more optimistic estimates of the past - and until now, they turned out to be like that.

2449,"&gt; Working towards an unblocking of the “Women on Boards” Directive, which would introduce quotas for gender balance on company boards

Putting gender quotas into place is a gamble that shareholders are making poor decisions as to who to put on boards -- that is, human labor capacity is going underutilized, and that this is what leads to fewer women in those positions.  If this gamble is correct, then EU industrial productivity will be strengthened.

But the flip side is that if shareholders are making accurate decisions in choosing board members, if there are fewer solid female candidates than male candidates in those roles, then EU industry will tend to see worse productivity.

Honestly, if the EU is ready to start mandating gender quotas in companies, I'd be more-interested to see a large-scale A-B test.  With a 50% probability, assign each company in the EU a ""gender-quota"" or ""non-gender quota"" status and make that status known for each company.  Then let the companies run for a few years and let scientists chew on the performance data.  Regardless of which approach is more-effective, that'd let the EU be midway between the two outcomes.

That'd be useful in that it'd eliminate confounding factors for existing studies on gender representation on boards.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cdoxkx/election_of_the_president_of_the_european/etw3x0s/,vokegaf,1563253079

2458,"You can still see the discussion page on that thing, it is absolutely massive. In an RT video, Russia was pushing tons of fake informatiin with unqualified hack ""experts"" and in one shot they sought to show that a barebones SU-25 cna fly that high. Only it is not shown how long and in what capacity. Basically it's clear that a pilot woukd have difficulties surviving at that height for any time.

Considering the position of MH17, the direction it flew in and the impact of the shots, Ukrainian Jets would have to scramble from the North-East of the plane in Ukrainian terrritory (the whole south/east was in rebel control and rebels recently at that time demonstrated they can shoot down Ukrainian fighters), overtake the oassenger plane over rebel territory (the passenger plane cruises at almost top speed of SU25 by the way), turn around and then shoot it from the front.

Right after the event happened, two Russian media outlets actually published stories, that Ukrainian fighter jets were shot down by pro-Russian separatists, which turned out to be MH17 though. I am pretty sure one of those articles is actually still accessible.

Also, another Russian theory was that Ukraine also had BuKs, so why couldn't they have done it? Ukraine immediately replied by showing the position of its nearest BuK system, which was too far away to be part of the attack. Russia also claimed that the BuK system itself could have been Ukrainian and taken by seperatists, which Ukraine demonstrated to be false by being able to account for the number of BuKs they always claimed they have.",,/r/europe/comments/cdk6s8/when_russiabacked_forces_boasted_they_shot_down_a/etw4l64/,YesWeCrazy23,1563253766

2558,"&gt;	Imperial is based on twelves (but even there it gets inconsistent)

Many of the units are divisible by 12. Nothing is expressed in base 12 though. 

&gt;	The thing is conversions between units are easier when you have units with the same base as your numbering system. 

I think at this point everyone acknowledges that it’s easier to shift a decimal point than it is to multiply by 5280 or whatever coefficient you need. I’m not sure why were talking about this though. The point remains that “1/2 cm” is a SI measure because fractions are numbers. Similarly, “0.5 in” is a US customary measure because decimals are also just numbers. The US customary system doesn’t own fractions and SI doesn’t own decimals.

&gt;	To convert from cubicmeters to liters i just have to shift the decimal point by three places. So one cubic meter is 1000 liters. A cubic foot is how many gallons? 7.48052? You tell me what's easier to work with. 

I think you’re overestimating how often most people need to convert between units. The last time I had to convert between feet^3 and gallons was almost certainly in a math/science class (same goes for m^3 and liters). I’m not claiming that the US customary system makes it easier to convert between units, but it just doesn’t matter in my day to day life. 

&gt;	You already count in tens so i don't understand why you don't use the units that count in tens.

US a customary units do count in 10! What comes after 9 feet? 10 feet. What comes after 9 cups? 10 cups. There are 3 feet in a yard and 4 cups in a quart, but that doesn’t mean we count in some other number system. Same goes for units of time, btw. What comes after 59 seconds? 60 seconds. Which raises an interesting question: How do you feel about units of time? Would you prefer to switch to metric time?

Honestly, I don’t think there’s much to understand here. The reason the US still uses the US customary system in most places is because it’s more convenient than switching to SI. That all there is to it. If people had to do unit conversions more often and a lot was riding on the accuracy of those conversions, then people would probably switch to SI. That just doesn’t seem to be the world we live in.",,/r/europe/comments/cd18ct/can_we_please_take_this_moment_to_appreciate_the/etvweeo/,lose_has_1_o,1563246482

In terms of the deal, the EU (including France, Germany and the UK) don't seem to feel that there is any particular need to increase sanctions or to unilaterally act against Iran at this point, and that again seems far more sensible than the US approach.

The US approach to Iran isn't working any more than the US's approach to Cuba did, indeed even with Iran being a real problem in the middle east, even with it acting as a state sponsor of terrorism and even with it being openly hostile to US and EU interests it seems to have managed to appear saner than the US in this area, because the US looked like it was arbitrarily trying to punish Iran rather than acting in response to something openly (the claims that Iran was somehow in breach of it's agreements turned into 'Trump doesn't like the deal that Obama agreed, because Obama'.

Furthermore, CM level accuracy will allow entirely new products and services that are simply not possible with a system like GPS that is accurate only to a few meters. You could for instance combine it with self-driving cars and make traffic jams entirely non-existent; if they're all networked together and the location of every car is known to within a CM of accuracy, then you can create perfectly optimized traffic patterns without any risk of collision; to a level simply not possible with GPS.

(If it's any consolation, you share that incapacity with approximately 70% of our contemporaries; after all, that's why we're still living in the quagmires we made for ourselves.)

The original European warrior culture you're so fond of emerged both in ancient Greece and (although later) in the northern parts of Europe. An example for the former would be Alexander the Great and the Hellenic Period; one for the latter would be the German *Nibelungenlied* or the (elder) *Edda*.

Both of those originally separate developments met and merged during the ""End of Antiquity"", when the North marched on the South, did away with the Roman Empire and give birth to a genuine pan-European warrior culture proper: Knighthood. Its birthplace: The carolingian Empire, i.e. northern France and western and southern Germany. 

As any culture, it requires a separate caste of people living according to certain traditional habits and caste-specific codes, i.e. *rites*. Take away the class and the culture is gone as well. 

That happened, as I've pointed out, at some point in the 12^th century, but at the latest on the battlefields of Azincourt (yes, that's the correct spelling)., where the entire class of people who *materialised* the culture perished and never recovered - notwithstanding faint, but shallow afterglows in Burgundy, emperor Maximilian and the German *Fechtbücher* (fencing schools). They tended to a culture because it didn't actually exist anymore (otherwise it wouldn't need tending to).

After the warrior caste went down in Azincourt, a new type of warfare emerged: the [chevauchée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevauch%C3%A9e), which means plundering, murdering, pillaging, raiding, mowing down innocent people by the bushel regardless of who they are, what they did or where they belonged. That's the **opposite** of what traditional warriors do and it goes against every single sacred tenant of their former class. 

And it only went further downhill from there, until we get to the point (in the 16^th and 17^th century) where the former *warrior culture* had been transformed into a *cult of butchers* living according to the *rites of serial killers*.

That's the culture you're sacrificing to.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/cdg6kq/forecast_of_the_world_population_for_2100_only/etvfwea/,ColourFox,1563234341

Fair enough.

With the difference that Africa poses a bigger migration potentional than Latin America. Maybe if things get really bad, it will push some WE countries to being tougher without necessarily going far-right. Maybe not, it's hard to predict.

Oh wow, I had 'old man yells at cloud' plenty of times, but I believe this is the first case of 'old man yells at RAID'.

&gt; Then do it. Point to actual data. So far you only brought forward conjecture and ""possibilities"", you weren't able to point at a single hard fact.

Mostly due to the fact that most things I said are logical conclusions of axioms. Like ""some things failing is better than all things failing"".

But sure. First we have to define what we are talking about since for example AWS is an enormous behemoth. Lets just use basic EC2 and take full advantage of all the ways you can do redundancy on AWS. I went through the (very short) list of [outages of AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Amazon_Web_Services#Amazon_Web_Services_Outages).

As such I can say:

A multi-region deployment on AWS EC2 would have had 100% uptime since EC2 became available.

But let's say the worst case happens to you and you are in us-east-1 and lose those 30 minutes of EC2 in 2018. Thats 99.995% availability! Pretty crazy and considered almost impossible. And before people come out of the woodwork ""mah servahs nevah went down"". Yeah mate, you don't have a million of them with hundreds of deployments a day. Or in other words: 

1. you are probably at the very tail end of a gaussian distribution which is a luxury that stops existing when your datacenters get big and / or:
2. it is a static environment without a lot of changes. Changes lead to failures so having less of them means a more stable environment. For a lot of companies that is not possible. They have to deploy stuff multiple times a day. This is where things become tricky.

If you do not believe these points apply to you, you could probably get a seven digit job at one of the bigguns.

Talking about the real world, there are indeed companies running 99.99% availability on AWS:

&lt; i had to remove this because it was deleted by automod &gt;

I went through reddits [historical data](https://reddit.statuspage.io/uptime) and in 2018 the had 99.975% uptime. As we know, they run completely on AWS, which means the underlying infrastructure must run at least at that level.

4 nines is pretty dope and better than most consumer ISPs for example which is why most internet companies (like for example [google](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/embracing-risk/)) aim for 99.95. Simply because the lost revenue is less than it would cost to get to a higher value.

Having 99.999 means 5 minutes of downtime *a year*. That means that if you get a SMS at night, roll out of bed and connect your VPN, *you failed*. Five nines means you have to automate the response to *every single failure* because humans are *too slow*. If you don't have that you are either small, extremely lucky, or don't have 5 nines, which means you are not better than AWS.

&gt; Meanwhile i quoted multiple instances where the added redundancy you preach only resulted in errors down the line that couldn't have happened if you didn't add those redundant systems. So no, i didn't prove your point, i proved my point.

No? 

Here is the argument.

I said. Do canary deployments. Deploy to a subset of servers that does not comprise your entire network. So a faulty software update only takes a small part down and not everything.

CF has a service called WAF. Since they have 150 datacenters and have handled DDOS attacks of over 1 tbit, you are probably going to be sad when I tell you a single server won't cut it. That means that if you want to update WAF rules, you have to push those rules to all these thousands of servers somehow. This has really nothing to do with redundancy or anything, it is a simple operational necessity.

The outage was caused, because CF deployed to all nodes at the same time = single software error takes everything down

So now, they only deploy to a subset of nodes instead. So a single software error only takes subset of nodes down.

This means the fix to the problem you posted was to do exactly what I said should have been done, canary deployments.

Your S3 example is also confusing because it it, too, happend due to the problems inherent in managing tens of thousands of servers.

Actually none of your examples have anything to do with redundancy, which in turn has nothing to do with my initial point of doing canary deployments, which is why your rant is even more amusing.

&gt; Because here's the thing, delayed/staged deployment is the opposite of redundancy. You split up your redundant systems so that a failure of one part doesn't kill the entire network, only the split off nodes. As in, you let part of your network die on purpose.

Yes, exactly. That is not a bad thing. It is limiting failures which WILL happen to a subset of your network instead of killing everything.

To your non sequitor RAID example, because I am bored:

&gt;Raid 5, an employee took out 2 disks at the same time to demonstrate the resiliency of the raid. (Chief IT guy, was demoted from his job for this) A failure that doesn't happen with single disks. Recovery time 3 days. If it had been 10 single discs, you could have reinserted them and rebooted the server just fine.

Guy is a moron who doesn't know what RAID 5 is. This also wouldn't have happened with cross node replication or a RAID that is not 10 years out of date.

&gt;Raid 5, complete failure after 1 disk failed and during the rebuild another disk died. Recovery time from backup also 3 days. If a single server had failed, we could have recovered after less than 1 day from backup.

This failure mode is the reason RAID 5 has not been best practice for around 10 years. These two examples are kind of like driving the safest car in the world off a cliff and then saying 'SEE! Its unsafe!'

&gt;iSCSI Storage Array with dual hardware controllers. During production it died every week. I created a test script that was able to kill both controllers with just writes within 5 minutes.

Shitty controllers. Single drives also have controllers.

&gt;Storage array with 2 PSUs. 1 PSU failed and nuked the mainboard at the same time.

Could have happened with one PSU as well. Would not have mattered if there would have been cross node replicationof course.

&gt;And another great one: Another Storage Array, 5x HP StorageWorks P2000 with load balancing. A single VM that did 50000 IOPS killed it, taking our entire vSphere cluster down. Great fucking job.

1. Shitty vSphere configuration.
2. would not have happened if you segregated storage into smaller pieces to limit the blast radius which means .. you are arguing my point again. Thanks.

Finally, here is some math as to your 'redundancy is bad' point.

Assumptions:

- We assume [real world data](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-stats-for-2018/), chance a drive fails in a given year is 1%.
- 3 servers with 10 Disks each
- Restore of an entire drives content takes 10 hours
- Service is critical, 1 hour downtime = 10000 USD
- Data on all drives is important, single drives failure means service is down.

Contender A:

30 disky bois

- chance a disk failure takes service down = 100%
- restore time = 1 * 10 hours = 10 hours

Contender B:

Modern software defined storage that stores a copy of data on three different disks, on three different servers

- chance a disk failure takes service down = 0%
- chance two disk failures take service down = 0%
- chance three disk failures take service down = 1 / (30 - 2) = 0.035
- restore time = 3 * 10 hours = 30 hours

To calculate the chance of at least 1 vs at least 3 of 30 disk dying, we need binomial distribution.

    B(m; p) = (m over n) * p^n(1-p)^(m-n), n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... m

Contender A:

    B(1; 0.01) = 0.224

22.4% chance to lose 100k ever year.

Contender B:

    B(3; 0.01) = 0.003

0.3% chance to lose 300k every year. That is, if the 0.35% chance happens that the three dying drives contain the copies of our data.",,/r/europe/comments/cdexvw/eus_gps_satellites_have_been_down_for_four_days/eturfu2/,madplayshd,1563218483

Nope. But consider yourself excused, since those earlier restrictions probably happened before you were born. Between then and 2015 there was also no need to restrict them further, since arrivals were negligible.

And what difference does it make to you whether these Middle Easterners are in Germany or Hungary (or Serbia)?

For some things it makes sense because you are dealing with pre-metric (UK switch that is) stuff, so a vast number of houses were built using non-metric measures, which means they 'make sense' in imperial, but don't in metric (think the width of floor boards and joist separation for example). You can work in metric, but it's far easier working in the measurements that were built in.

Essentially that should mean that people are familiar with both systems and we use metric by default wherever it makes sense (and keep moving in that direction where we can). 

Moving back to imperial is mad though, it'd be like trying to shift back to pre-decimal currency.

2920,"&gt; Common solution is still necessary though

Well Germany is proposing a coalition of the willing for a redistribution scheme for the migrants coming to Italy. I think this is a pretty good solution, the countries which think it's okay to allow people to come this way, can have them, while the rest of us opts out.

I am sorry, but that's about as far as we can get to a ""common solution"" to the problem of Africans illegally crossing into Italy. Look, the entire European asylum system is a joke at the moment. It was never intended to work this way, it wasn't created for the situation we are having here and so it's massively abused. And we allow that abuse by our inability to punish and deter those who abuse it.

If we wanted to make the system more sustainable, we would have to re-do it entirely, including looking at all the international refugee treaties that we signed. And this is never gonna happen in the Western Europe, not in the current circumstances, not with the current political representation.

Schengen is very important economically for all of Europe, so I am pretty sure that it will continue existing more or less. At least I don't see why it would have to change by more illegals arriving into Western Europe. If there is some future big wave, it may temporarily cause a shutdown of certain Schengen borders, but once the situation settles, it's gonna go back to normal.

If some of the Western populations turn far-right because of this, then that sucks, but it's their own problem. What are we supposed to do about it?

2922,"Which tactical maneouver makes sense? The one where you run away, so enemy hits your flank, ending with massacre of one banner?

And wait what? A tactical maneuver? Light cavalry uses tactical maneuvers? Whoa. I wish infantry and heavy cavalry could use some tactical maneuvers too. It would make sense.

&gt;this is how you use light cavalry

Not this is not how you use light cavalry.


Ok, time for armchair general cosplaying.

First of all, your post have not really usefull info, just some generalisation, but I can guess the tactical maneouver is feigned retreat. Of course it is this one. So, here we go:

Feigned retreat is not something that can be done only with light cavalry. It's just easier with light cavalry, but heavy cavalry can pull this one just as easy. 

The retreat of Lithuanians in battle of Grunwald couldn't be feigned, because it broke few basic rules:

1. It has to make sense. The goal is too move enemy in a way, that makes them vulnerable. With battle going already on, one flank ""feigning retreat"" basically means, that one flank is lost, and enemy will flank center. And guess what, this is what actually happened. But what if that was the plan, and now Lithuanian forces will come back at knights, all happening in a mere minutes? Well, that didn't happen, Lithuanians were gone for hours. Maybe they were already practicing Deep Battle strategy from 2WW, with a goal to encircle few armies on the whole front? Or maybe they just run away?

2. Everyone participating in feigned retreat needs to know, that this will happen. Yeah, that obvious, isn't it? Imagine if part of your forces fled, but the others were not informed. These other would have bad time. And guess what, Smolensk banner didn't flee, and was massacred by teutonic order. They didn't know, that they have to run, because there was no such a plan.

3. Everyone is army has to know, that feigned retreat will happen. From Polish knight PoV, he would see almost all of Lithuanian banners escaping battlefield, and many Teutonic banners overhelming one Smolensk banner. Not a good thing for a morale.

If this was feigned retreat, it better not be. Because there is no way that one could fuck it more. It's like going to shooting range, holding gun like bazooka, trying to tick safety only to shoot someone behind you, because not only you can't differentiate between safety and trigger, you were also holding a gun with a buttock in the front.",,/r/europe/comments/cdg67k/on_this_day_609_years_ago_battle_of_grunwald/etug5ex/,Centurha,1563211832
2923,"&gt; Under the WA backstop will only be used if a no solution to the border is found and lasts only until a solution is found.

It lasts until both sides agree a solution, if one side doesn't wish to the other is required to prove in court that they are doing it deliberately as an act of bad faith.

&gt; UK does not need permission from EU but to find a solution to the border question and if the arbitratirs see it suitable 

The arbitrators can't force to EU to agree to a solution no matter how viable it is, if the EU doesn't want to they don't have that power they can only allow the UK to leave with no-deal if they UK proves the EU is deliberately trying to keep it in the backstop with no intention of reaching an agreement, which according to the UKs lawyers is almost impossible to prove legally unless the EU outright say that's what there doing.

There is clearly a solution to the border both the UK and the EUs own experts have been saying that that since early in negotiations.
https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/596828/IPOL_STU(2017)596828_EN.pdf

But the EU negotiating team have have gone to great lengths to discredit the suggestions in press and instead focused entirely on the backstop instead, despite strong evidence that it directly violates the GFA.

However Ireland have hinted that in the event of no-deal they would implement a system like the one proposed by experts on both sides. So the only realistic way for the UK to get the EU to agree to a solution for the Irish border might be no-deal.",,/r/europe/comments/cd0kp6/us_tells_britain_fall_into_line_over_china_and/etug5gy/,MinimumPoint,1563211833

* The EU has an oil embargo on Syria, but that only pertains to buying oil *from* Syria, not the other way around. 

The US has sanctions on Iran, including oil and petrochemical products; but as far as I know, the UK is neither obliged nor justified in executing sanctions of a foreign power.

quote in dutch:
Kohl had de indruk gekregen dat Lubbers niet erg pro-Duits was. „In verkiezingstijd en met de hereniging van Duitsland in volle gang had Kohl het idee geopperd dat Silezië bij Duitsland gevoegd zou moeten worden. Dat zou erop neerkomen dat de Oder-Neissegrens ongedaan zou worden gemaakt. Dat zou dus verder gaan de hereniging zoals die uiteindelijk tot gebeurd. De Oder-Neissegrens was niet realistisch en teveel van het goede, dat vond ik echt. Bovendien beschouwden wij Nederlanders de Polen vanuit de oorlog als geallieerden. Ik zei hem toen: ‘Helmut, dat kun je niet maken. Ik snap wel je electorale argumenten, maar dit gaat te ver’. Nadien heeft hij zich tegen mijn Belgische collega WIlfried Martens laten ontvallen: ‘Der Ruud is nicht Deutsch freundlich’.

3021,"&gt; I could point at the real world uptime things like AWS, Google and CF achieve and how it is statistically undeniably better than the old way but I will leave it at one thing that wonderfully encompasses the fact you don't know what you are talking about: 

Then do it. Point to actual data. So far you only brought forward conjecture and ""possibilities"", you weren't able to point at a single hard fact.

Meanwhile i quoted multiple instances where the added redundancy you preach only resulted in errors down the line that couldn't have happened if you didn't add those redundant systems. So no, i didn't prove your point, i proved my point.

Because here's the thing, delayed/staged deployment is the opposite of redundancy. You split up your redundant systems so that a failure of one part doesn't kill the entire network, only the split off nodes. As in, you let part of your network die on purpose.

Just like if you don't run a storage system with a raid but with singular disks.

Speaking of storage systems, so far i have seen following failures of redundancy firsthand:

Raid 5, an employee took out 2 disks at the same time to demonstrate the resiliency of the raid. (Chief IT guy, was demoted from his job for this) A failure that doesn't happen with single disks. Recovery time 3 days. If it had been 10 single discs, you could have reinserted them and rebooted the server just fine.

Raid 5, complete failure after 1 disk failed and during the rebuild another disk died. Recovery time from backup also 3 days. If a single server had failed, we could have recovered after less than 1 day from backup.

iSCSI Storage Array with dual hardware controllers. During production it died every week. I created a test script that was able to kill both controllers with just writes within 5 minutes. Again, a simple HD in the server wouldn't have died that way. Complete power cycle was required each time. (This was a storage array for vSphere none the less, guess what happend to the VMs)

Storage array with 2 PSUs. 1 PSU failed and nuked the mainboard at the same time. 

And another great one: Another Storage Array, 5x HP StorageWorks P2000 with load balancing. A single VM that did 50000 IOPS  killed it, taking our entire vSphere cluster down. Great fucking job.

3050,"Flygskam is the Swedish word for giving up flying to protect the planet. Another idea to combat climate change is barnskam, or... a resignation from offspring - we read in ""Rzeczpospolita"".

According to the American scientist Kimberly Nicholas, the resignation from one child is equivalent to saving almost 60 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. This sum consists of, among others transport and consumption. According to calculations, the child's year of life causes an emission comparable to the daily operation of a car for 24 years.

According to the researchers, the most beneficial actions for the climate include: a transition to veganism, a resignation from a car, a resignation from flights by plane and planning a smaller family. As Nicholas adds, the resignation from a child can not be an excuse for frequent flights or driving a car. As she says, in the context of the climate, children are ""by far the least of shames"".

As we read in ""Rzeczpospolita"", the philosopher Jonna Bornemark believes that the desire to give up bringing a child into the world seems to be mathematically logical, because there is a limit to how many people our planet can maintain. However, she adds that our children may be able to find a way to a more balanced lifestyle than we do.

So how to balance the problem of the growing demand for employees and the children's climate harmfulness?

In the next decade the government has planned renovations and maintenance in order to keep the Deltaworks functioning till at least 2050. Currently the government is taking a 1-2 meters sea level rise for 2100 in account. The problem is, of course, we don´t really know how much it will actually be and how fast it will happen. In the likely event that sea level rise will be worse than we are currently expecting we can still take quite a bit and we´ll have time to prepare. I guess the key will be to make the infrastructure as modular as possible so we can increase the defenses in the future with relative ease.

3241,"&gt;&gt;&gt;**Christine Lagarde shows how to deal with imposter syndrome**
-

&gt;&gt;She may not be the best qualified candidate for ECB chief, but she is not there by chance
-

&gt;Once again, [Christine Lagarde](https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Christine_Lagarde) is breaking the glass ceiling — and facing a chorus of doubters. They have valid concerns this time.

&gt;Ms Lagarde is not a monetary policy specialist or an economist by training, skills which, in a perfect world, ought to be part of the job description to succeed [Mario Draghi](https://www.ft.com/content/c92f5dbe-9d76-11e9-b8ce-8b459ed04726) at the helm of the European Central Bank. The eurozone crisis underlined how critical the institution is to the still incomplete currency union and emphasised the outsized role of the ECB chief in swaying the bank’s council over untested policies.

&gt;Yet her nomination conveys a positive message to women having to deal with another kind of critic: the inner voice of self-doubt psychologists call [imposter syndrome](https://www.ft.com/content/3a48e852-81f3-11e9-b592-5fe435b57a3b). This feeling of “not being up to the job”, first described by US researchers [Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes](https://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf) in 1978, disproportionately affects women in senior jobs and partly explains why they often hold back from pursuing top leadership roles.

&gt;In 2017, *Feminist Fight Club* author [Jessica Bennett](https://www.fastcompany.com/40405364/seven-ways-ive-learned-from-other-women-to-fight-imposter-syndrome) suggested Ms Lagarde might not be immune to it. The managing director of the IMF “overprepares regularly”, Ms Bennett wrote. She quoted Ms Lagarde saying: “When we work on a particular matter, we will work the file inside, outside, sideways, backwards, historically, genetically, and geographically. We want to be completely on top of everything, and we want to understand it all, and we don’t want to be fooled by somebody else.”

&gt;Consider this. Ms Lagarde has faced accusations of incompetence ever since she stepped into the spotlight as a political novice in Nicolas Sarkozy’s government. Her ascent may seem stellar, but there have been lows.

&gt;A few days before Christmas 2016, I watched her as she sat in the front row of a small wood-panelled courtroom in Paris — the same one in which Marie-Antoinette received her death sentence during the French Revolution. Her back to us reporters, and a signature shawl around her neck, she took notes as former finance ministry colleagues described her failings in preventing an allegedly fraudulent [€403m state payout](https://www.ft.com/content/dc75777e-c37a-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354) to businessman Bernard Tapie when she was minister.

&gt;She should have known, they claimed. I might have been “deceived” by my staff, she said. She missed a vital memo that raised the alarm, they pointed out. “I received between 8,000 to 9,000 notes per year,” she pleaded. Although spared a prison sentence and a fine, she was found guilty of negligence, though the court decided the conviction would not constitute a criminal record, and on Tuesday, Mr Tapie and Ms Lagarde’s then chief of staff Stéphane Richard were acquitted over the same affair.

&gt;It could have been fatal to her career. Yet in Washington, Brussels and Davos, the former corporate lawyer had amassed enough political capital to keep her IMF job, overseeing troops of economists and bailout programmes around the world. She might not have been an extraordinary French finance minister and it is too early to judge her legacy at the fund. But she has survived, proving that a woman can succeed in those jobs.

&gt;A handwritten, undated [letter](https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/06/17/la-lettre-d-allegeance-de-christine-lagarde-a-nicolas-sarkozy_3431248_3224.html) to Mr Sarkozy that investigators found in Ms Lagarde’s apartment during the Tapie affair triggered snarky comments at the time, but offers a glimpse into some of her tricks.

&gt;“Use me as long as you wish and as long as it suits your action and [cabinet] make-up,” she wrote. “If you use me, I need you as my guide and supporter: without a guide, I risk being ineffective, without support, I risk lacking credibility. With my immense admiration, Christine L.”

&gt;Beyond the excessive flattery, she intended to remind the president that her failure would be his too.

&gt;As for the ECB, Ms Lagarde may not be the most qualified candidate, but other more obviously suited choices, such as German central bank governor Jens Weidmann, who opposed Mr Draghi during the eurozone crisis, would have raised other sorts of concerns.

&gt;Ms Lagarde will rely on different talents. “***She has a great international reputation***, she has a great understanding of situations, [in public] she has never made one blunder, not a single gaffe,” said a former central bank official who attended international meetings with her. “It is a risky choice for the ECB, but she has not arrived here by accident.”",Romania,/r/europe/comments/cdgatt/christine_lagarde_shows_how_to_deal_with_imposter/ettoljr/,Ebadd,1563190465

That people are not all the same is a fact. That people from certain countries **tend** to have certain characteristics is also a fact (e.g. tall Dutch, short Chinese, black Senegalese, loud American etc). They are not very relevant when taking in a specific person, but they are when you take hundreds of thousands of people. That's usually how statistics work.

&gt; How are the statistics relevant? Are you going to deny that person entry because of the statistics of the country they are from?

If I see that Somalis are causing tons of problems in my country, disproportionately compared to the local population, I'll either fully stop immigration from there or be a lot more strict with whom I let in. Whether it is fair to those people is not relevant imo, since moving to a country is privilege, not a right. This is exactly how the American or Canadian systems work for tourist visas, if more than a certain percentage of tourists from a country cause problems, then they don't get the visas waived anymore.

&gt; The reason that it's not relevant, is because there is no causation. 

Doesn't matter what the cause is, just the effect.

3371,"Base 12 actually does offer some big conveniences. 10 can be divided into 2 and 5. 12 can be divided into 2, 3, 4, and 6. The issue is more that nothing about imperial is consistent. If imperial units behaved like metric in that twelve of each equals one of each step up, it would actually be a very good system. If you learn to count in base 12 in school, and dedicated numerals for ten and eleven are determined, you would actually find the units more convenient in most situations than metric. How often do you split your restaurant bill with four other people, compared to two or three? There's a reason so many engineers and mathematicians call the duodecimal system optimal.  
  
If we assume that, for example, ten is written as A and eleven as B, then twelve is written as 10 and we have a counting system that works just as well in your head. 9+1=A, 9+2=B, 9+3=10, 9+4=11, B+6+6=1B You can even count base 12 with your hands, you simply count next to fingers rather than on fingers.",Россия,/r/europe/comments/cd18ct/can_we_please_take_this_moment_to_appreciate_the/ettdzyf/,KrasnayaDruzhina,1563175126

3375,"&gt; Germany was already under ruthless Nazi rule for nearly a decade at that point, the first Germans died in concentration camps back in 1933 simply for belonging to the political opposition. That was before the notorious ""Night of the Long Knives"" which completely cemented the Nazi power grab in 1934, and put the persecution of political opposition and dissidents into hyperdrive. 

Night of Long Knives was internal struggle of power within Nazi party it had nothing to do with anti-Nazi resistance

&gt; The only reason Rosenstrasse worked out like that was due to the on-going war efforts focusing most of the Nazi attention outside the Reich, after all, they had a whole decade to clean their internals. 

The only reason was that Nazis actually cared about opinion of common Germans. The notion of poor persecuted German nation by evil nazis is a false one, but notoriously reproduced by contemporary German propaganda (see Unser Mutter Unser Vater). Rosenstrasse was the only large scale anti-Nazi protest in Germany and it was succesfull. 

&gt; It's also quite likely much more could have been prevented if the US would have staunchly opposed these developments while they still were confined to Germany. Instead, the Nazis got a whole lot of their ideas straight out of the US, from ""Untermenschen"" Rassentheorie to Eugenics programs, along with a lot of praise by prominent US Americans, like Henry Ford.

The current population of Germany is around 80 million, back then it was around 60 million, not that you care much, for you it seems to be all the same.

I'm using ""these few"" to ""whitewash"" killers? What the fuck are you even talking about? *You* are using ""some few"" to ""blackwash"" literally all Germans as complicit.

&gt; You’re focusing on Germans and ignoring was they were doing in Europe.

You are doing literally the opposite, implying that no German ever resisted, belittling the tens of thousands of Germans who ended up as the very first victims of concentration camps due to their political opposition to the Nazi terror.  


&gt;but point is even Hitler’s opponents supported wars, genocides and slavery as long as they were beneficial for Germany. 

  
If you define ""Hitler's opponents"" as solely Stauffenberg, you might have a point, but you are still ignoring over a whole decade of history prior, particularly those that opposed everything Hitler stood for, his wars, his genocides, his slavery, **since the very beginning**, even when it meant certain persecution and very likely death, **they were the very first to die**.

3548,"&gt; The only reason Rosenstrasse worked out like that was due to the on-going war efforts focusing most of the Nazi attention outside the Reich, after all, they had a whole decade to clean their internals.

They had hundreds of police officers threatening to gun them down but not doing it, it was definitely on the Nazi radar. Furthermore, other early protests on separate issues such as to labor and religion had occurred and extracted some concessions. Consider the case of [Hans Meiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Meiser_(bishop)), which happened in the same year as the Night of the Long Knives- after the fact. No distraction by making war on the rest of the world at that time, and yet the Nazis again backed down to make public protest go away rather than cracking down.

&gt; It's also quite likely much more could have been prevented if the US would have staunchly opposed these developments while they still were confined to Germany. Instead, the Nazis got a whole lot of their ideas straight out of the US, from ""Untermenschen"" Rassentheorie to Eugenics programs, along with a lot of praise by prominent US Americans, like Henry Ford.

I absolutely agree that the US could have done so much to prevent Germany from inflicting a disaster on the world- unfortunately, we were far too naive at the conclusion of the first World War, stupidly pouring in cheap loans to build up German industry for the sake of having a better trade partner and always moving to lighten Germany's treaty obligations over the objections of our allies. We and the world would have been far better served by letting the French take the lead- then Germany wouldn't have been able to implement those terrible ideas, certainly not on a continent-wide scale.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/cd23pk/merkel_honors_hitler_assassins_laments_rise_of/ettam2n/,sparkling_uranium,1563170806

Germany was already under ruthless Nazi rule for nearly a decade at that point, the first Germans died in concentration camps back in 1933 simply for belonging to the political opposition. That was before the notorious ""Night of the Long Knives"" which completely cemented the Nazi power grab in 1934, and put the persecution of political opposition and dissidents into hyperdrive.  


The only reason Rosenstrasse worked out like that was due to the on-going war efforts focusing most of the Nazi attention outside the Reich, after all, they had a whole decade to clean their internals.

3794,"&gt; The issue is related to the telemetry both cloud-connected solutions send back to Microsoft in USA, which ranges from standard software diagnostics to user content from inside applications, potentially sentences from documents and email subject lines.

As an aside, I'd point out that sending diagnostic data without leaking private information is something of a general problem for software.  Like, it helps developers a *lot* to have, say, a full core from a crashed process, but trying to audit that to figure out what sensitive stuff might leak is pretty difficult.

Web browsers are a great example -- If you send a core or even a stack trace with embedded parameters in it, you *might* be leaking a lot of information.

Might be interesting to have language-level support for tagging data as ""sensitive"" and use that tag data to process diagnostic data.  Could also make it easier to audit for things like leaking sensitive data into unencrypted paging space on disk -- if I can require that all ""sensitive"" data not be paged out, I can keep that locked in memory.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cd7w92/german_privacy_commissioners_ban_windows_10_and/etsinb5/,vokegaf,1563146609

Just like kids count on their fingers. You actually think it is a coincidence? 39.37"" is 39"" 37/100 BTW. I dont get what is so hard to understand. If you divide 10 by half you cannot divide it by half again without partial numbers. You cannot divide it by quarters and get a round number, you get 2.5. You cannot divide it by thirds either, you get 3.33333333 infinity. If you have 12 divided by quarters you get 3. Divide that dividend by 1/2 to get 1/8 you get 1.5. Divide 12 in half, get 6. Divide 12 by thirds, get 4. Many of these numbers you can divide again to split your fractions in half and get numbers you can compute easily because they aren't irrational. If your number system give you irrational answers when you try to do something as basic as split something into three pile, you may need a better system.

Math may be very hard for you if you do not understand this basic principle and concept. But hey, you don't think we count by 10 because of our digits. That's preposterous.

 I suggest you do some research. The Babylonians actually used their knuckles when they counted which gave them a different base system. Most of the rest of the world was using base ten since ancient times. Base 12 is considered by many mathematicians to be a superior number system for the reasons I stated and others. Why do you think a circle has 360 degrees and not 10? Notice 360 divided by 12 is 30? Base 60 would be even better than base 10, but then we would have 60 different symbols to memorize before the numbers rolled over. Base 12 would only require two new symbols and would be much more logical when doing complex math.

There are books on these things. I have read a few, I suggest you try to read one before you go spouting BS again. Just because ten people for every one who read this think I am wrong, does not make me wrong. It just makes me disappointing that 9 out of 10 people dont know basic mathematical principles and theory.

Base 10 is good for % and decimals, but when was the last time you were with two friends splitting something and said I want 0.3333333333 of that? You should get a THIRD. I could go on and on for hours typing up facts on why you are wrong, but I have to go finish building something.

That is because there is no such thing as a unified Islam. Wahhabis also don't have a culture of praying to the dead (which is considered idolatry by them). Alevis don't even go to mosque. You should look at other Hanafi Muslims like Uzbeks or Turkmens.

The closest thing that Hanafi Islam has in common with Orthodoxy is the Saint worship. In Orthodox Christianity there are ""patron saints"" (who have the same role as lesser gods and idols had in pre christian societies). There are patron saints for traveling, war, nursing etc. And In Islam, or at least in Turkish Islam, there are ""evliyas"" that will help you if you pray to them at their tombs.

or, it can measure as accurately as you need it to.. you can change the precision to adjust to the situation 

however, at some point, it’s easy to see that neither system is more accurate than the other.. they are identical in precision.. literally identical 

in a human sense though, where we’re marking and measuring things that are our everyday sizes and using tools such as rulers and pencils, it very often the case where marking with imperial scales is more precise.. not always but more often than not

there are better methods or systems which would benefit the entire world if we could get past the ‘Americans suck because Imperial ‘ bs which will then allow people to recognize the good and bad things about Imperial... as well as the good and bad things in Metric..

Either way, you proposed an exception to the rule; it's okay to assassinate politicians so long as they are totalitarian dictators committing human rights violations.

I agree with that completely, but it is still illegal, and therefore it begs the question of what other exceptions are there to the rule that assassinating politicians is a bad thing? 

If you propose such an exception based on ethical reasoning, then other exceptions are opened to consideration based on ethical reasoning as well.

4204,"In fairness, unless you’re in a building trade or maybe a cook, you never use 99% of imperial measurements, which is a major reason people just don’t care. 

In day to day life, you need to know (with no serious precision):

* miles - translates into ‘a longish way’

* yards - basically a meter, you guess it in the same ways

* feet - literally just ‘how many rulers can I fit in that space’

* inches - just subdivide a foot - half a foot, maybe a quarter foot, etc. 

* gallons - a milk jug or a gasoline container

* pints - a beer glass

* cups - literally just use a cup

* teaspoons and tablespoons - literally just use a spoon

* pounds - guess using body weight and experience 

* ounces - translates to ‘lol lighter than a pound, I’ll guess in the same way with inches’

* degrees Fahrenheit - the only one I’ll contend is objectively more functional than metric

We do also need to know liters, but that’s it. 

If you’re not baking, it’s all just guesstimation anyway, so the simplicity and precision of metric don’t really make a huge difference. Whether I buy my fuel in gallons or liters, I’m still paying ~$40/tank. Whether I weigh myself in pounds or kilograms, I’m still about at the high end of a healthy body weight for a guy my height. Whether I tell you it’s 28 or 72 outside, it’s still a nice day. 

Which is not to defend imperial. We could and should switch and we’d be fine. But the reasons we don’t are generally rational.

I can divide base 12 (1 foot) by 2, 3, 6, 4 and have round numbers to work with to divide again if needed or multiply. If I try to divide things in the metric system by 1/3 for example, the answer doesn't even add up. Then if I have to divide that again, it gets even worse. I can reduce inches evenly, double them, divide them again, still usually get round numbers. If you are building a cabinet, making something smaller, larger, etc, I can much more easily in my head compute what I need.

&amp;#x200B;

Metric is great for people who cannot do fractions in their head, but if you can do fractions and work with your hands, the metric system is not a preferred method. It is easier to convert to % for working in the sciences, but for hands on building, cutting, welding, and other things, the metric system sucks. 10 is not divisible by 3, 6, or 4.

Read your previous response and the comment it was a response to again.

Milk and beer (sometimes) are measured in entirely different units. You say that's fine, because you can just convert it. My point was that that same argument could be used to have different units for every single different liquid. The examples I gave were in ml, because that is a commonly understood unit, but the amounts were the unit. So one milk unit, in my example, would be *converted* to 330ml.

To respond to your edit, the issue with the 10.558... is not the division between multiple people. It's the conversion. My argument is that having to do conversions for the same liquid in comparable quantities because one is UHT and one is 'fresh', or one came from a tap, and the other was bought in a bottle, is fucking retarded.

1l split three ways is 1/3 of a litre, or 333.3 recurring ml. It's easy to split. I can make the same argument about imperial units. Want to divide a foot into nine sections? Oh, look, you have 1.3 recurring. Obviously the imperial system is massively flawed. Got a pint of something? Splitting it three ways, you each get 6.6 recurring fluid ounces.

Any time precision matters, metric is the vastly superior choice. When precision doesn't matter, your large number of decimal places is fucking irrelevant anyway. There is no actual sensible defense of the imperial system, especially in UK terms. MPG but fuel in litres? Just use litres. It's the unit we use for liquids in 99% of situations.

4311,"&gt;Bro, you're confusing decimalisation with metrication. US customary units have regular used decimalisation when appropriate for hundreds of years.

Replace metrification with decimalisation and everything that I said is true. The decimalisation of customary units is the metric system bleeding into US units.

Decimalisation and Metrification might not be the same, but they go hand in hand because decimalisation of units that are not based on a base 10 system is inherently limited.

&gt;People love to talk about metric like decimalisation was it's biggest contribution, but that has been around for a long time, and use of decimalisation in measurement systems predates metric (though it does require a base-10 number system...a base-12 number system would almost certainly be better, but isn't worth the effort of changing).

The idea is older, but the first actual implementation (in the West) happened with the introduction of the metric units.

&gt;The big contribution of metric was clearly defining related units in reasonable ways relative to other units (like, for example, how one L is a 10 cm³ cube).

ie, a pint of beer never needs to be converted to another unit, except for half of itself. 'A pint of beer' basically means 'a regular beer', regardless of the actual volume. You never need to convert miles to yards in daily life, just fractions of itself, and a mile is so long that people can't really visualise conversions.

But we'd use cm, ml or grams because they're smaller, everyday units that you'd frequently use and multiply - cooking, DIY, etc. Basically the rule seems to be metric for things you'd ever actually measure, imperial for 'set' measurements.

&gt;I can't believe there are people who believe the things you do.

&gt;What you are defending is directly against your best interest as a national citizen.

Actually I made it very clear that it's *for* my best interests. There are lots of countries, several of them very close to Europe, where governments did not provide fertile grounds for investments and upheld their authority when they didn't want to be questioned. The result? Nobody invests there anymore. For citizens this meant poverty, unemployment, working conditions comparable to slavery, fleeing to Europe. I don't want that in my country.

It is in my best interest as a citizen to have jobs, and to have enough opportunities so that I can show my middle finger to my employer when they misbehave and find another job.

To get that I need good economic development.

And to get that I need fertile grounds for investments.

Of course.

You haven't read my post it seems, just think what this productiveness come from and why it's a bit 'artificial' in case of these countries, whose economies depend on foreign investments attracted by cheap labor. Not to mention they're not ""enough productive"", they still have only 70-80% of EU-15 productiveness (that includes relatively non-innovative countries like Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece etc.).

This 12-year-old middle school student who suffered a particularly violent bullying at Collège Françoise-Dolto in Marly-la-Ville (Val-d'Oise) was the subject of an article in Le Parisien on Thursday. The widely shared paper on the networks has made many supporters of the PSG react. In the photo that illustrates the article, Louis's face does not appear to preserve his anonymity, but we see that he wears shorts in the colors of the club of the capital. This is what gave the idea to a user to appeal for the student. ""It will not erase anything but if we retweet until the PSG organizes a1 meeting with the players? They could give him confidence ...? "", Wrote Guillaume Mélanie in a tweet . The message was already repeated 14,000 times after 24 hours. ""It's crazy, it increases almost 1,000 retweets per hour,"" says Guillaume Mélanie. Co-chair of the association Urgence homophobie, he says he was moved by the fate of the college student. ""Even if he is not homosexual, he has all our support,"" he adds. ""PSG is all your life"" To bring some comfort to Louis would not be useless in view of what he suffered. During the year, he experienced insults, beatings, but also sexual assault and even rape. He tried to put an end to his life and is always followed at the hospital of Gonesse. A gesture of the club would not leave him indifferent to the words of his mother. ""PSG is his life. As a child, he had the PSG pacifier, the PSG body, ""she says. The father, the mother and even the sister are all fans of the club. ""We were at the jubilee of Pauleta. Cavani is my idol.

People don't care and don't want Western problems because Poland is not at that level yet. It's starting from a point where homosexuality is still a foreign thing even among many ""leftists"".

If a town instituted a new build code that day and said every house currently being built needed to change that'd cause issues. And if its a serious safety issue than that's the state's failure, not the company's. The state should be held responsible and then the people should hold the incompetent state responsible and vote for a new one. The state should strive to be transparent with planned changes, give ample warning, and in the case of severe safety issues take responsibility.

4996,"Time and time again the only way forward presented to Turkey is absolute unconditional acceptance of all demands or sanctions, threats, violence, punishments.

Similar situation exists with Greece in the Aegean; the region is unique due to Greece owning multiple islands and their demanded sea borders essentially extending deep into Turkish land mass let alone sea borders; sensitive issue that needs long term constructive dialogue and negotiations but that problem is also being dealt with ""my way or the highway you are encroaching upon an EU border, cease and desist right now.""

Same situation in Syria with the US; ""I will come into your neighbourhood demand a terror group you and I mutually oppose to rebrand itself to make it easy for me to aid them, establish a mini state on your borders that supports irredentists in your country and turn around and demand you cease hostility with them because they are now US allies, you are attacking my allies are you my enemy now?""

Same situation with the S400, for years refusal to sell any and all advanced weapons to Turkey then acting surprised when it chooses the most advanced system on the planet etc. the token literal last month before the delivery of Russian system ""offer"" to sell the Patriots Turkey chased for decades and turning around and saying ""well we did offer them they must be pro-Russia now to refuse""

I am defeated at this point; yes a country with the location and import of Turkey requires respect and reciprocity from larger powers and sovereignty is important etc. but at some point the constant squeezing and poking gets to ya. Yeah the ""honour"" of the country is important but so is the future of the children there, the economy, the prospect of your allies backing terrorists that may detonate the next car bomb in an airport or bus stop that might kill your children, the suffering of your grandparents being minimised in discussions etc.

You don't mention supposed Turkish troops raping people but totally mention it while giving credit to yourself for not mentioning it, be open I don't mind it believe me I deal with people that demand genocide of Turks and liberation of Anatolia on a daily basis. You wanting to see Turks removed from Cyprus is not that extreme in comparison. 

As I was saying yes honour etc. but fuck it at this point. No nation on earth would remove their troops after one side tried a genocide on their citizens, no nation on earth would trust that government ever again (you can attack me for mentioning a genocide as well, another facet of being from Turkey online, I do accept the Armenian Genocide btw.) but Turkey does not have the right and at some point when every other powerful ""ally"" nation that your economy and security depend upon say you do not have the same rights and standards as them you have to accept it, as I said the future of the next generation are more important than geopolitical games.

Turkey should bring back all troops and willing Turkish citizens from Cyprus, leave US-UK-Israel-Egypt-Greece and Cyprus to deal with how they plan to divide up the resources in the region, accept whatever solution Cyprus sees fit and obey their conditions, open border crossings with the US backed regions in Syria, melt the s400 during a live stream and buy billion dollar contracts of US weapons that come with added catches and apply them all.

A Turkey that needs the permission of Greece to sail ships from the Aegean cost, and needs the permission of Cyprus to sail into the Mediterranean is a weak Turkey for sure but hopefully one that won't be constantly be under threat of sanctions and punishments. I see the necessity of the first intervention from Turkey into Cyprus and as I said before see the second phase and occupation as illegal and harmful; even if we remove the moral consideration. It turned the Turkish position from one of righteous defence into offence and not annexing it but making it a separate entity didn't fool many. Luckily nowadays there is multiple news of actual dialogue and cooperation between the two sides so that is good news at least, but me pointing out that other countries would have done more and their actions would be accepted is enough for you to use the aggressive ""you"" and accuse me of being pro-land grabs etc.

If you are pro-Kurdish rights and even federation but don't like the PKK; you are an Erdogan supporting ethno nationalist.
If you accept blame for the second phase of the Cyprus invasion but point out that them being accepted into the EU during negotiations and language that is already enabling the removal of Turks from the island or dismissing their rights to the resources around it is concerning; you become a person that is unable to differentiate between the need of intervention and a land grab.

Anyway Im ranting at this point I know nobody give a shit what I or anyone from Turkey thinks, sorry.

In summary the issue will be solved somehow. Its all sabre rattling anyway even if Turkey somehow finds gas during these drilling efforts the grand alliance of Saudi-Israel-Egypt-USA and Cyprus naturally who have all voiced a willingness to respond with violence against these efforts will not let Turkey benefit from these gas reserves and if they somehow do let it; the sanctions that will be levied will exact a huge price perhaps comparable to the ""loss"" of not using these resources. All of those countries are and have been very eager to engage militarily with Turkey for a long time anyway. The current government in Turkey may think they are asserting themselves aggressively in a push back fashion but the recent rhetoric and how some language got normalised clearly state the current state of affairs to be an existential crisis for Turkey, yet they keep pushing these countries and don't seem to be aware just how hated Turkey is atm. EU is far more pro Iran than pro-Turkey atm.

We will see if cooler heads will prevail but Cyprus matters to the EU even during rosy amazing relations period of the early 2000s the issue of the troops in Cyprus and Turkey not recognising ""Southern"" Cyprus as the sole owner of the island always came up in EU Parliament meetings as to why Turkey should be accepted into the union, that prospect if generations away if ever possible now but that is still important to showcase just how much European countries care about Cyprus so Turkey has to given in at some point if it wants the Economic and other benefits of the EU in the long term, or it will be branded and acted upon as a rogue state and cease to exist, the aggressive reaction stemming from the very common [Sèvres Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A8vres_Syndrome) itself ironically threatens to create the very same conditions that lead to the western powers invading and carving up the country.

Of course Cyprus was accepted in the EU, what did you expect that it would remain Turkey's hostage forever? All Turkey would have to do during the negotiations about the reunification, is keep giving terms that the south could never accept and thus it would effectively keep the south outside of the EU. That's almost what happened during the U.N. plan. Turkey pushed additional terms in the last moment and the south had to reject the plan. The world won't wait forever for the Cypriot issue to be resolved, especially when Turkey is stubbornly refusing to withdraw the army. They will move on without the turkish part and accept the Rep. of Cyprus as it is. 

If Turkey really cares about the citizens in the north it should consider withdrawing the troops, taking one step towards the end of the illegal occupation that has been going on for 45 years, and then when the reunification takes place the turkish-cypriots can benefit as well. If they're trapped in a pseudostate unrecognized by anyone, because of Turkey, and they don't reap the benefits that they would otherwise have, that's on Turkey.

(And yes, as citizens we want our tax money to be used for that because, if we don't, companies won't trust our contries to do any more investments and we will lose in jobs. It's about maintaining a reputation of stability and credibility to attract investors.)

The prime responsibility of the state is to secure the wellbeing of its citizens. If a law aimed at increasing said wellbeing conflicts with the wellbeing (i.e. the profitability) of a company, the former should trump the latter, and the state should not be punished for doing so.

Veterans and their families were usually offered full UK citizenship, as were non-ethnically-Chinese residents of Hong Kong, as were ~50,000 people by application and various other people through ancestry, spending time in the UK or a whole number of other loopholes and mechanisms that had existed in the UK colonial and overseas territory system at the time. 

Ethnic Chinese citizens of Hong Kong could only ever apply for 'British National' status, which was/is not citizenship and does not confer the right to move to the UK. Even many of those who could have had the opportunity get residency would essentially have had to have moved to Britain straight away, which most weren't willing to do. 

In the end, around 5% of HK residents or fewer were actually offered full citizenship. The Conservative government at the time, backed by parliament, supported a policy of strictly limiting immigration to the UK (this was a core Thatcherite policy, and didn't change until the final years of John Major's government in 1996-1997). There was a big fear after 1989 that millions of Hong Kong residents would flee to Britain (a country that, at the time, had immigration of less than 100,000 per year), this was considered politically dangerous. 

Of course, in the end Britain opened up to mass immigration anyway, except it turned out to be from South Asia and Eastern Europe instead of Hong Kong.",,/r/europe/comments/ccqdj1/the_lennon_wall_outisde_uk_consulate_in_hk/etp4r9u/,CarefulExamination,1563045697

5366,"&gt; Yes, because this guy is personally responsible for ten million deaths. Clearly!

He actually is.

The Kaiser's personal responsibility in starting the war is tremendous.  If you read about the Bismarck through 1914 period, it's hard to find a way to *not* blame him.  Almost anyone else in his family would have avoided the war.  If his father, Frederick III, had lived, there certainly would not have been one - he was a liberal with pacifist tendencies.  If his grandfather had somehow still been alive (which would require a bit of a miracle, seeing as he was born in 1797), he wouldn't have started the war either - he deferred far too much to Bismarck, and Bismarck desperately tried to avoid more conflicts after uniting Germany.  Wilhelm II appointed sycophants and weak men.

It was Wilhelm's dogged determination to create a colonial empire and to secure Germany's pre-eminence on the continent (hence his support for the faction of the general staff that wanted to attack Russia before it was too strong), that lead to him making or support moves that lead, step by step, towards war.  And he did *nothing* to temper the German public's desire for glory (and to be entirely fair, French governments generally didn't do much to restrain their public either - but French governments changed so often that this gets very complicated).

I would be shocked if the consensus among historians wasn't that Wilhelm II had the most single responsibility for the war.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/ccmjdh/german_kaisers_heir_wants_seized_artifacts_back/etom07i/,sluggathugga,1563031450

These terms are pretty similar and can be easily mixed up. Members of parliament are directly elected in local elections, but do not decide the prime minister. Party members are just normal people who have signed up to a particular party (in the case of May, the conservative party). They do effectively choose the prime minister.

For example, we are currently seeing debates between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson. One of these will become prime minister, and the outcome is decided by ordinary people who have an interest in the conservative party.

5411,"&gt; All that you are saying is correct, but the idea that it is Germanys fault that Austria-Hungary went to far is weird

Without the backup from Germany it is unlikely that AH would have gone balls to the walls. They asked for German support specifically before issuing the ultimatum. Germany should have just said no. 

&gt; Also, the idea that Germany should have created an alliance that would have allowed AH to invade Serbia is really weird, too.

It's not about allowing AH to go to war, it's about Wilhelm II alianating Germany from every other European power that wasn't german-speaking. Germany as it was created in 1871 was an absolutely insane shake-up to the power balance in Europe. Germany was at that point suddenly the most militarily powerful country in continental Europe, maybe the entire world. Noone outside of Germany really liked this. As such maintaining alliances was instrumental in securing Germany's new position. Bismarck created an intricate web of alliances. Wilhelm II neglected all alliances but the Austrian alliance. This made Germany very vulnerable because if they neglected the austro-hungarian alliance they had an entire continent in discontent with them and no real allies. The UK would always have been the optimal ally for Germany for tons of reasons and I doubt the UK would have allowed AH to go to war like that.

&gt; The two big things imo. was that Germany launched a pre-emptive strike against France and invaded neutral Belgium. Especially the second part is unforgivable.

Germany declared after the mobilization of France, I think it's only a formality, it wasn't like french troops would merely stand around at the border while their ally was getting smashed. The 1870/71 war for example was declared by France but provoked by Bismarck. 

As for invading Belgium (and Luxembourg) it was a major hostile act and not doing it could have kept the UK out of the war and avoided the huge escalation. Though I'm not entirely sure the UK would have really stayed entirely out of it. Afterall this would have been a war France and Russia would have likely lost, making Germany even more powerfull.",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/ccmjdh/german_kaisers_heir_wants_seized_artifacts_back/etomol4/,tobias_681,1563031990

5425,"About ten European leaders will be present on the occasion of the national holiday. Theresa May, absent, will be represented by her Deputy Prime Minister, David Lidington.


French President Emmanuel Macron will host a dozen European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, at lunch on Sunday at the Elysée on the occasion of the national holiday. The Elysée was waiting for a response from resigning British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. It will finally be represented at the July 14 parade by British Deputy Prime Minister David Lidington. The traditional 14 July parade will this year be dedicated to European military cooperation.


The leader, whose successor's name will be known in ten days, will not be travelling to France. Theresa May is due to hand over her position on July 24 to her successor, following a vote by members of her Conservative Party to decide between the two candidates, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, former and current foreign ministers respectively.


**A parade under the banner of European military cooperation**


The traditional 14th July parade marking the taking of the Bastille in 1789, symbolising the end of the absolute monarchy, will this year be dedicated to European military cooperation. The nine countries participating alongside France in the European Intervention Initiative (EII) - launched a year ago under the leadership of President Macron, with the aim of developing a ""shared strategic culture"" - will be represented in the parade: Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Estonia, Spain, Portugal and Finland. The parade on foot will open with their emblems.


At the end of the military parade, the Head of State will receive for lunch at the Elysée the Presidents of Finland, Sauli Niinistö, Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, according to the list of guests sent by the Presidency on Friday. Also present will be Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Ministers Mark Rutte of the Netherlands and Charles Michel of Belgium, as well as President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, and Defence Ministers Margarita Robles of Spain and Trine Bramsen of Denmark.

"" Stress process theory suggests that the positive and negative aspects of relationships can have a large impact on the well-being of individuals. Family relationships provide resources that can help an individual cope with stress, engage in healthier behaviors, and enhance self-esteem, leading to higher well-being. However, poor relationship quality, intense caregiving for family members, and marital dissolution are all stressors that can take a toll on an individual’s well-being. Moreover, family relationships also change over the life course, with the potential to share different levels of emotional support and closeness, to take care of us when needed, to add varying levels of stress to our lives, and to need caregiving at different points in the life course. The potential risks and rewards of these relationships have a cumulative impact on health and well-being over the life course.

&gt;What’s your objection to Ireland’s government choosing to hold referendums?

None whatsoever. It’s just sad you guys are so easily fooled.

How many re-runs or a referendum are acceptable to you I wonder. Would having the third actually make you consider something might be up here, would you rationalise it away too.

&gt;I understand why countries might disagree with each other, but why would countries TRY to disagree with each other? If they already agree?

Funny way of acknowledging that EU votes when it comes to government can only be allowed to go one way.

Consider yourselves lucky I guess. At least the Irish got the pretence of democracy.

France held a referendum on the EU constitution and lost, so they relabelled it the Lisbon treaty and signed it without a referendum. Likewise with the Netherlands.

The U.K. government at the time was elected on a manifesto promising to hold a referendum on it, but after seeing France and the Netherlands lose they decided to sign it without holding one.

The Irish, requiring a referendum due to the constitutional changes involved, held it twice. Since voters rejected it the first time. Then the second campaign of course stepped up the message. With the recent economic downturn, the EU was praised by Yes parties and media supporters as the only solution to economic woes.

&gt;It was lashing with rain but that wasn't the full reason Paul Callaghan was finding it hard to muster up the enthusiasm to mark his X. ""I'm here because I have a vote and, basically, I've been told what to do with it,"" he said gloomily as he stood outside one of Dublin's polling stations in O'Connell Street on Saturday afternoon.

&gt;""Look at the state we are in now,"" he said. ""A year ago I had a job, life was rosy. Today?

&gt;""I've no job and neither has my wife. Every time I turn on the television some politician tells me that only the EU can save this country now. I don't want to do it, I feel disloyal, but today I am voting yes. It isn't how I voted 16 months ago, but I've been left feeling I have no choice.""

&gt;""The whole Celtic Tiger image is dead,"" said Mr Callaghan, a former store manager, as he stood among a disgruntled group of voters. ""When times were good we had the confidence to say no to Europe,"" he said. ""We've learnt a lot in the past 16 months. These days jobs are hard to find. We are going to need the economic backing and security of Europe.

&gt;""It was like being sent back to the drawing board and told: 'Think again.' I think many like me who have switched sides and voted yes this time just feel we don't really have a choice. It's a bit like Groundhog Day. We all have this horrible feeling that we will be made to do this referendum over and over again until we return the answer they want.""

Most of these rivers would periodically have more or less catastrophic flooding events, and since these the farmers around these rivers probably never left the river area in their entire lives, well, this area would then seemingly contain the entire world of these people - they simply wouldn't regard much of anything outside of it.

I'm more inclined to believe a hypothesis like this, because it speaks  to the universality of human experience and emotion (which is surely the same in all cultures, simply by nature of the human brain being the same everywhere) and not a supposedly singular event that has somehow survived an incredibly long time in folk lore **without** the written word.

When one leader of a party steps down, members of the party (mostly just ordinary people who have signed up and pay a fee to be part of the 'club') can vote for the new one. Anyone can join any party, ad you can be a member of as many as you like. 

The winner of this vote become the leader of the party. If that party was already in power, the new leader usually automatically becomes PM, although any member of parliament, on any side, can ask for a vote of no confidence and attempt to vote them out. If the party the new leader belongs to is not in power, they become the opposition leader, and at the next general election, the people can vote for the party (although many vote for the leader or figurehead rather than the policies) of the party they like best.",,/r/europe/comments/cbsr34/brexit_illustration_by_r_fresson/etoek82/,aplomb_101,1563025269

5552,"&gt;Germans aren't allowed to make it an issue or anything negative that happened to the German people in WW2

That is not true. It was, for a long time, the only aspect of the war that was part of public debate in Germany (openly acknowledging the Holocaust didn't happen until the 70s). Even in the late 80s/early 90s, with the reunification and the question of where the eastern border would lie, the fate of East Prussia was a huge topic in politics.

&gt;It is not normal to pass off the mass rape, murder and systematic eradication in some cases of your own people as an insignificant note in history.

Not as insignificant, but as a note in history, yes. Let's be honest, this has happened in every major war ever. That doesn't make it right of course, and the victims should be acknowledged, but it is not the exceptional event you're painting it to be.

The Holocaust on the other hand was the industrialised mass-murder of specific parts of the population (gays, Roma, Slavs, any minority deemed unworthy, basically) or an entire people (the Jews), with the expressed purpose of complete eradication. This was, in its dimensions, absolutely singular, and comparing the fate of the German people to the Holocaust is... misleading, to say the least.

Soweit ich weiß nicht. Selbst meine Betriebskrankenkasse ist glaube ich von diesen minimalen Leistungen, die entschieden werden, betroffen. 

Anscheinend sind alle gesetzlichen Krankenkassen Pflichtmitglieder beim GKV ([source](https://www.gkv-spitzenverband.de/gkv_spitzenverband/der_verband/wir_ueber_uns.jsp)), was bedeuten würde, dass es eine private Krankenkasse geben könnte, die das nicht anbietet. Ich kenne aber leider selber keine. Von den 4 verschiedenen, durch die meine Eltern gehen mussten, haben bisher alle auch Homöopathie übernommen. 

Ich glaube, anstatt sich da drauf zu versteifen und auf teufel komm raus die Kasse zu wechseln, würde ich den GKV direkt anschreiben oder auch ans Gesundheitsministerium schreiben.

Wenn du eh schon privat versichert bist, kannst du natürlich auch versuchen, ne Kasse zu finden, die das nicht anbietet. Allerdings müsstest du dann auch aufpassen, dass die Qualität von denen noch okay ist.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't trying to bash Bulgaria or any other country, I was just trying to say that, in my opinion, artificial measures that most governments take to promote population growth (like financial incentives) just aren't very effective. 

I'm no expert on this but it does seem to me that developed countries, only have their population line go up because of immigration. If say NL decided to close the doors to everyone, so no people going in or out of the country, do you think your population graph would still be trending up in 20 years ?

Therefore it seems to me that what countries like Bulgaria and Romania can do to combat this, is not financial incentives - that will never be enough - even without the mass exodus that's going on. They should instead try to make the countries more attractive places to live, so that they don't lose the people that are already there and they might even get people coming in from other places.

He was a member of the Severan dynasty, the elder son of Septimius Severus and Julia Domna.

I wonder if this episode would have garnered so much attention from the medias had the captain not been a lovely young woman.

More importantly, we see very little discussion of the all-important question of what to do with people fleeing a war-torn country. International laws on those matters, though, have not changed much since the end of WWII.

Furthermore, in the specific case of Lybia, some further understanding could be gained by remembering the Italian [occupation or yore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Libya), but I guess that the question of which responsabilities the colonial powers of yore bear in the contemporary development of their former charges is a bottomless pit that nobody is too eager to explore. Nevertheless, in this specific case, it should be reminded that [ENI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eni), Italy's own Big Oil, has been *very* active in Lybia since 2011 and that the *Repubblica Italiana* is not exactly an innocent bystander here.

While you still find a lot of old roman fortresses and churches in Greece, they are simply not comparable to things that own the title of cultural world heritage. The standard very high.

There is still upward potential for Greece and also for Russia, but it's not as high as you may think. It's only natural for Italy to be at the top, as it has impressive structures from roman time, the middle ages and the Renaissance while States like Greece and Russia fail in at least one of those Eras.

I’m on phone atm and searching scientific papers is ridiculously difficult on phone, I’ll link more when I get my hands on my pc. One of the most common mistakes people make when comparing Turkish DNA to ancient anatolians is using data of a group of Turks from all across Turkey. In reality Turkish genetics differ quite a bit from a region to another. If you compare Hittites to a Turk that lives in Edirne for instance, the simmilarity won’t be any more than a Greek. As seen in the article I linked certain Anatolian civilizations can be traced to current day Turkey but they all have their small communities that don’t really mix.

We managed to shut down a lot of them in the city center, but a lot of the money exchanges in the Metro stations (Florenc has 2, Muzeum has 1 at least, Pankrác has 1 and Anděl has several) that we cannot for the love of god get shut down.   


Good stuff, though! My friends from the Czech Pirate Party managed to push through a law that ANY money exchange MUST give you a RECEIPT. With this reciept (be sure to get it! They might not want to give it to you, just say the magic words ""You have to by law, I am calling the police"" (number is 158 for police btw, but 112 works aswell) and they will hand it over.) you can CANCEL FULLY any transaction within 3 hours of it.   


So, if you exchange 100 euro, you should get about 2600 crowns. Mostly a little less, its still a bussiness. These other fuckers will give you 1600! Be sure to check it and cancel the transaction.   


Another tip, dont take a taxi just standing on the street, most in the city center will scam you. Dont buy food or drink in the small shops in city center, they will try to scam you. Buy in chain stores (like Albert, or Žabka) and you will be golden, dont use taxis, public transport in Prague is great and you will get anywhere by walking or public transport.

Yugoslavia was very diverse economically, that's for sure. Slovenia felt and looked just like a little Austria, while Kosovo or rural Macedonia could be deemed third world. Serbia was somewhere in-between but it did have a decent share of Yugoslav industry and Belgrade was a modern city by eastern European standards (you can compare Yugoslav commieblocks to Warsaw Pact ones - the former are usually of better quality, even if they're not that well maintained nowadays). 

Still, I think the standard of living (aside from GDP etc.) was higher in Yugoslavia (even Serbia) than in Czechoslovakia (even Czechia) and it had a lot to do with what you mentioned - better access to western consumer goods, being able to work in the west etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**After Ursula von der Leyen's surprise appointment on 2 July to head the Commission, her confirmation by Parliament's vote seems to have been compromised, as she has been struggling through her hearings by MEPs. This failure is attributed by many to the scheming of Martin Selmayr, the Secretary General of the Commission.**

&amp;#x200B;

Is Martin Selmayr crashing the candidacy of his compatriot, Ursula von der Leyen, for the presidency of the Commission? Ten days after her surprise appointment on 2 July by the EU Heads of State and Government, and given the German Defence Minister's performance in front the political groups in the European Parliament, this question can be seriously raised. She has struggled so much in front of MEPs that her election, which seemed certain on Tuesday in Strasbourg, is no longer guaranteed. However, who is in charge of managing this delicate period of transition between two commissions? The Secretary General of the European Executive who is none other than Martin Selmayr, the man whose head has been called for twice by MEPs following his fraudulent appointment in February 2018. Observers and several European capitals, including Paris, see in their champion's chaotic beginnings the mark of the ""Monster of the Commission"", the nickname given to Selmayr.

&amp;#x200B;

Ursula von der Leyen's problem is that she arrived in Brussels without any knowledge of Community affairs and without mastering the Commission's administrative machinery, and especially Parliament's subtle equilibriums. However, it is difficult to become an expert in less than two weeks, especially since, at the same time, she must convince 751 MEPs from 28 countries, representing more than a hundred national political parties, spread over seven major political groups, to vote for her. Without the determined support from the Commission services, this is an impossible task. However, she does not have it: the man who heads them, Martin Selmayr, defends his interests first and foremost and not those of his institution, unlike the Secretaries-General of the past.

&amp;#x200B;

**Keeping the reins**

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, it is to him that the EPP Conservatives owe their divisions at the summit that lasted from June 30 to July 2. On Sunday 30 June, ahead of the European Council, German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked her Conservative counterparts to appoint the top socialist candidate, the Dutch Frans Timmermans, as President of the Commission, as the candidate of the EPP, the German Manfred Weber, did not have a majority among the 28 and in the European Parliament. Selmayr then encouraged the Eastern European countries, faced with a fait accompli, to demand the presidency for their political family in order to prepare for the election of ""his"" candidate, the conservative Croatian Prime Minister, Andrej Plenkovic.

&amp;#x200B;

Why such a move? Because since Timmermans hates him cordially, he knew that his appointment meant the end of his reign in Brussels. This is also the case if a German is nominated, moreover, as no country is ready to accept a President and a Secretary General, the most important position in the Commission, of the same nationality. Finally, a president from a small country was Selmayr's assurance of staying in charge: he built his career by leading a Luxembourg commissioner, Viviane Reding, for ten years, and then a Luxembourg president, Jean-Claude Juncker, whom he literally invented by imposing it on the EPP in 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that his manoeuvres were not very discreet, either within the EPP or the Council: ""At each session break, Selmayr would talk to Andrej Plenkovic as a coach talking to his boxer"", says a European minister. His behaviour annoyed the leaders so much that his departure ""is in the package"", as a French official explains: ""It is agreed that Von der Leyen will have to get rid of him and I can tell you that Selmayr was livid when his name was mentioned by several leaders."" And he cannot count on the support of Angela Merkel, who does not forgive him for dividing the EPP. It is a first for States to demand the departure of a Eurocrat.

&amp;#x200B;

**Verdict Tuesday evening**

&amp;#x200B;

The Secretary General is now playing two sides to save his skin: at worst, to demonstrate to Von der Leyen that he is absolutely essential to control the Commission or, at best, to bring her down to allow the Croatian Prime Minister to get back into the race. Plenkovic's name has reappeared in the hands of a few journalists close to him after the German's failed performances... His manoeuvres began as soon as the transition team was appointed. Instead of providing high-ranking officials to prepare it as well as possible, the Secretary General has appointed four second knives for his devotion, because they owe him their careers, which ensures him total control of operations (1). Ursula von der Leyen was only able to impose two of her relatives from the Ministry of Defence, her chief of staff Bjoern Seibert, who knows no more than she does the house she is to run, and her spokesman, the former journalist Jens Flosdorff.

&amp;#x200B;

But the Minister of Defence is not ""partridge of the year"", as one diplomat put it. After her unenthusiastic performances in front of political groups, which chilled her most loyal supporters, she realized that she had been ill-prepared and that her cautious attitude dictated by Selmayr was turning against her. To the point that today it is not impossible that she may only owe her possible confirmation to the votes of the eurosceptics and the extreme right (it needs 376 votes minimum), which would be just as catastrophic as a failure. Her relationship with Selmayr deteriorated sharply and Von der Leyen launched Operation Survival, supported by Berlin and Paris. Only her keynote speech on Tuesday at 9 a.m. can turn the tide before the vote scheduled for the same day at 6 p.m. These manoeuvres worthy of House of Cards show that the Commission's political takeover will be the future president's first mission.",,/r/europe/comments/ccm8xi/presidence_of_the_european_commission_house_of/etnucel/,sloes,1563000559
