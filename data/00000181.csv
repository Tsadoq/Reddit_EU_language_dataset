11,"In American legal culture, it's considered inappropriate/illegal to have the same person prosecuting law and judging the law. I mean, this type of separate of powers is the basis of Anglo-Saxon legal culture. That's why we have juries, because it's a notorious conflict of interest to have the state both prosecuting/investigating/and judging. That's even why in the US we have grand juries which are normal juries which issue indictments, to keep even the ability to indict someone separate to prevent abuse of authority. (I understand that the UK abolished the grand jury in the 19th century but we still keep them around)

&amp;#x200B;

In the EU, the EU Commission helps draft the competition law, then the EU Commission investigates companies, then it prosecutes them itself, and then it judges them. IT'S THE JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONER. 

&amp;#x200B;

To boot, the EU competition commissioner Vestager is a politician herself. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then when US firms appeal to the European Court of Justice, the EU Commissioner gets to tell the judges how the law ought to be interpreted since they helped draft the regulations themselves. So just take any ambiguous clause and say 'of course the legislative intent is that it means this, I know cause I wrote it"". And that's why the EU has never lost an anti-competition case. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I want Trump to put sanctions on the EU for this because this is a Banana Republic style legal system. This is just European politicians fining US firms with no sensible legal oversight.

30,"These are good points.  I'm an American who saw firsthand as waves of Somali refugees began settling down and assimilating in the US during the 90s.  These refugees were selected by the UN (not the US) and were largely uneducated when they arrived, but in the long-run most of them have successfully assimilation.  Some reasons why:

- Many refugees are relocated to smaller cities and suburbs because of the lower cost of living.  

- There's no welfare for able-bodied people.  You either work or you starve.  Getting a job often means having to adapt to societal norms.

- Schools don't cater to immigrant parents' desires.  Your kids go to school and study the curriculum, full stop.  If you try to keep your kids home from school (which some parents tried to do with their daughters), the police will show up at your door.  Many of the students go on to technical colleges that directly translate into careers, especially in nursing and IT.  

- The ""American Dream"" is a real thing.  You can come here as an immigrant, get a job, start a business, buy a home, send your kids to college, etc.  If you're ready to work, there are opportunities in front of you.  

I hate to use the ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" cliche, but that's the reason why immigrants tend to assimilate so well in the US.  They assimilate simply because they *have* to.  ",,/r/europe/comments/axb02o/birmingham_school_stops_lgbt_lessons_after/ehtjo5i/,neversaidnothing,1551761162

Whereas alcohol is a [Class 1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_cancer) carcinogen to which 3.5% of all cancers are attributed. Look to [Table 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243677/#!po=0.555556) of this document and see how frequently consumption of alcohol is mentioned as a preventable exposure associated with human cancer.

At least around where I am, many of my coworkers like to have a beer at least once every two weeks or so. Some of them more so. The alcohol content in beer (say, 5% ABV?) is much larger than that for potassium bromate which can start at [5-80 parts per million](http://www.aaccnet.org/publications/cc/backissues/1960/documents/chem37_573.pdf) in bread initially before it is baked and reduced by more than half as it reacts. You‚Äôd have to eat a huge amount of bread to eat an appreciable amount of potassium bromate to compare with a single beer. Of course, wine and spirits are often much stronger.

72,"&gt; You‚Äôre aware of how the EU was formed right? The shared values and heritage aspect of the EU came way later than the economic aspect. 

That's irrelevant. At this point a more integrated EU can't be built on the aspects that started the union. If you want to keep it as a purely economic alliance, that is fine, but current EU wants to be much more than that. That requires you to build up a sense of unity, that isn't there today and can only be achieved through persuasion/propaganda.

You can also call his list of perceived grievances what you like, but it is the reality of how part of Europe sees the EU. The important part is to admit it is a fact you have to deal with, no matter what you think about it. Sneering at it and just saying its nonsense is not going to get you were you want to be. You'll just get patted on the back by people who agree with you and will be ignored by people you don't. You need to change those perceptions, so the amount of people with such views are too few to matter. Supporting a narrative about shared values and heritage is one way to address it. 

I talk about perceptions specifically, since that is what matters. The current situation with vaccinations is a good example why it is so. People can fear vaccinations and that perception has serious consequences even when the threat isn't real. If reality matches that perception, it is much easier to achieve and maintain. It's important to understand, that you can achieve the perception without reality matching it and fail at it even when that is the reality.",,/r/europe/comments/axcflz/macron_dear_europe_its_time_for_renewal/ehtm4as/,DoubleSteve,1551763717

I only mention coal because my thoughts are let‚Äôs replace coal with biomass, it wouldn‚Äôt be the solution but it would help get the numbers down in the short run.

The thing is, I totally agree with you on the nuclear option. It‚Äôs our best bet for baseload power, and if we could do wind, solar, tidal and nuclear I‚Äôm with you.

But sadly the current climate is vocally against nuclear, so I can‚Äôt see that happening. Plus it takes a long time to build nuclear plants, and a high upfront cost in an uncertain regulatory environment. The advantage of using biomass to replace coal is that they use very similar processes, so the infrastructure costs would be minimal. You can retrofit coal plants to use biomass, and at the least phase out coal before better options.

No, and nor is Germany (it still exports weapons to states with massive human rights issues). My point is that a consequence of Germany taking this position is that it is likely it will be excluded from future contracts.

&gt;What is next? War is good as long as some people are making money?

No, of course not. But the people making the weapons might not want Germany to take part in their joint projects given Germany's actions here.

In 2015 when a French citizen, Serge Atlaoui, was expected to be executed in Indonesia. The ambassador of France in Indonesia said it loud and clear : kill him, and there'll be consequences in the diplomatic relationship between our two countries.

325,"Well, not really, because there were urban centres in Britain prior to the Romans. Quite a lot of them, and some quite big. I'm not just talking about the oppida of central and southern England (which are the stand out examples), but countless large hillforts all over the country.

I've been researching the distribution of hillforts and promontory forts in Wales for a map I am hoping to complete, and I have been struck by both their number and their size. 

For context, this is in a country where, throughout the early Medieval period, there was a grand total of one settlement that could justifiably be called a town: Carmarthen. It was only with the Norman conquest in the 11th and 12th centuries that some nucleic urban centres started to develop around colonial boroughs and ecclesiastical centres. 

By contrast, on the Ll≈∑n Peninsula alone, there are three large stone-walled hillforts: [Tre'r Ceiri](https://coflein.gov.uk/en/site/95292/details/trer-ceiri-hillfort-llanaelhaearn), [Garn Boduan](https://coflein.gov.uk/en/site/95271/details/garn-boduanbodfean-hillfort) and [Carn Fadryn](https://coflein.gov.uk/en/site/95275/details/carn-fadryn). The largest, Garn Boduan, contains the remains of approximately 170 hut circles. 170! Even if half were used for storing grain, Wales would not see a town of this size again until the Early Modern period! By the time Wales was conquered in 1282, there were perhaps two tiny towns on the peninsula: one, Nefyn, where Edward I held a jousting competition to celebrate his conquest, and the other, Cricieth, where a borough was established to support the castle.

Notably many of these hillforts, including those on the peninsula, seem to have remained in use throughout the Roman period, coexisting with the Roman towns in the lowlands. Iron Age and Roman Britain appears to me to have been a very crowded place compared with what came after. This can be seen in the size of the military conflicts: during the Roman conquest, the Silures tribe (who lived in Glamorgan, Gwent and Herefordshire), were able to raise enough men from their tiny corner of the island to defeat the Roman Second Legion in battle. Boudicca is said by Cassius Dio to have led an army 230,000-300,000 strong, a number that is doubtless vastly overstated, but it still took an army of 10,000 to defeat her rebels. Britain wouldn't see armies of such a size for hundreds of years after the Roman withdrawal.

* For 2^nd degree murder: probably not because the lack of the planning element (no opportunity to weigh the deed against the punishment), but it could be decided on a case by case basis.
* I don't think 3^rd degree murder has a fixed definition, but if you mean manslaughter then no because of the same reason.
* Injuring to the point of disability: if planned then in principle I think amputation could a suitable punishment. There is however the practical problem of releasing a disabled perpetrator back into society, because it would decrease their chances of becoming a productive member of society.
* Rape: not amputation of a limb, but I think castration would be very suitable for rape because it would usually also take away the desire to do it again. I think this is something we are currently to reluctant to do, especially with repeat offenders.

Never claimed something else.

That's where you are wrong. There have been countless scientific papers proving that the death penalty does not reduce crimes like murder and that there are too many people being executed that will later be cleared of their crimes.

This is reddit. This board is laid-back and people don't have to be prude and professional. This isn't the embassy channel. Please don't act like you haven't been here on this board before. 

What I notice in many of your posts is that you tend to exaggerate things to an absurd level. Also, many of your posts imply that somehow russia has control of the US even when they are sanctioned and their endeavors to get rid of the magnistsky act have only gotten their agents arrested. What was the european response when russia blew up a plane full of EU citizens? 

I am not going to fault eu officials for it as there is many shades of gray involving these political matters. I am also not going to say it is because the kremlin controls the eu council. That would be silly.

&gt;The Americans have fuck all ""by the nutsack"", and if the Germans actually tell you to leave, you will, and you will do nothing to stop them. 

They haven't for many reasons(they have done the opposite recently) but it doesn't matter because Americans are leaving of their own accord. Americans stationed in europe has been at it's lowest since 1940. More and more bases are being decommissioned and more Americans are going home. We are leaving of our own accord and also leave NATO if we want to and the EU can not do a thing to stop them. No matter how many visits to the white house Merkel makes trying to convince the US not to which on a more humorous note gave the idea to trump that germany owes a lot of money to the US. 

&gt;""They"" meaning German people? Because this is factually quite dubious. A plurality of Germans wants the Americans to leave. And I quite deliberate made a distinction between people and leadership.

The percentage of germans who want american military in their borders is greater than those who have good opinions of american relations. The two-faced EU leaders that appeal to that sentiment also have a different tack when they go to visit the white house.

The Picts merged with an Irish Tribe that migrated to Northern Scotland, which gave birth to the Scottish Gaelic language and the Scottish Highland culture.

In Southern Scotland they speak Scots, a Germanic language extremely closely related to English.

There are Germans who disagree with you which is why I said yours.   Yes obviously many Germans agree, probably more than disagree, but I'm not speaking with them collectively.

&gt;combined with the fact that ""our"" human rights offer vastly more guarantees and rights than other ""interpretations"" of them, I am deeply convinced that this is the superior interpretation and definition.

More ‚â† better.  Giving a pedophile the right to look at underage porn would be more of a right than many definitions offer but I think we'd both agree that it's not a right they deserve.  

I think you seem to be subtly suggesting that, through due process, taking the life of someone who has dedicated their existence to destroying innocent lives and destroying western civilization is immoral.  Is that correct?

&gt;And in the end it doesn't matter whether you agree with that, because it is not about disagreement, it is about what laws and treaties our countries abide by.

No shit, but this wasn't a discussion about what law is on the books its about whether those laws ""are a good thing"" or not.

&gt;Fundamentally disagree. So would most european legal scholars.

See above answer.

&gt;This is thinking from the stone ages. We pride ourselves in not going down to the level of our ""enemies"" or other countries.

On their part it is.  You're suggesting that me acknowledging that is ""thinking from the stone ages""?  Huh?  

&gt;Everyone deserves to be treated fairly according to the rule of law, no matter who they are and what they did.

Agreed.  Again, *whether the law allows for the death penalty is not being debated*.  

&gt;These people are still - despite whatever atrocities they might have committed - human and therefore human rights apply.

I'd say they willfully gave up their humanity and therefore it's humane to euthanize them if their guilt can be proven sufficiently.  I say it's inhumane to take money from helping sick, underprivileged, elderly, etc. citizens and use it to keep people who act like animals healthy, sheltered and well fed.

Unless you want me to call Franks a branch of germanic culture whose religion is a branch of germanic religion the same prayed by another branch of germanic culture.   
Germanic is as vague as saying of Roman culture.   
The proper name would be northern germanic group culture with the Norse praying Norse religion who live in scandinavia, and the other Northern germanic culture who are also Norse believer and who also go by the denomination Norse but don't live in Scandinavia.    
If you don't want to blend Scandinavia with other group, then say Scandinavia because Norse is not just a Scandinavian thing. 
Vikings isn't a culture, however it was specific to a culture.    
As for language, not every language is directly linked, the lingua Franca was langue d'oc and D'o√Øl, not French, if Norway language and culture would disappear for another Scandinavic country, it would not be right to talk about the language spoken by another name.    
Same here, a ancient langue does not necessarily result in a modern one, that is why they have different name.   
And if the language spoken in Normandy was indeed the direct source for French, then you would be right, but it is not the case, Norman is just another French dialect that belong to the dialect continuum of the langue d'o√Øl, just like there is Scandinavian dialect continuum or a Slavic one.

630,"&gt;I'm sorry but in what world do you live in where you think this can possibly work? 

Well, legitimate exporters and importers are going to want to comply with the law, so for the bulk of goods, the rules will be applied without too much of an issue. Failure to comply would create massive liabilities for those countries after all.  It's not like legitimate firms spend a lot of time trying to figure out how they can illegally get their goods into other territories. 

&gt;First of all smuggling since apparently there's no infrastructure and there won't be free movement of goods, but goods can just go through the border with nothing holding back? It's literally an open door for smuggling

Erm.. There would be off border customs checks (think at existing ports for goods crossing the island, logistics hubs and so on. And again, most legitimate firms don't want to smuggle their goods, they want to pay their fees and tariffs and make sure they comply with the law.

As to smuggling, there is smuggling now, detecting and managing it is something you can do with enforcement. You can check vehicles off the border sporadically, you can check goods that are sold in both the UK and Ireland.. It's not a new problem.

&gt;Other EU nationals could go to Dublin, cross the border and take a ferry to England

Yes.. they could. Is that a problem? They'd have no right to live and work in the UK (FoM won't apply) but I don't think the UK is likely to start barring EU nationals from visiting the UK.

763,"&gt;As I stated, the SPD has this position due to morality. And it's part of the government. By any standard, morality is at the very least a driving factor here.

The SPD has this position because it is electorally popular, government has taken this position because it keeps the coalition together and is a cheap way to pull in left wing votes. Again, this war has been going on for 4 years, Germany has taken a pretty washy position up until the khashoggi murder, and again, it seems happy to sell arms to other countries with human rights issues (and say, cooperate with Russia over NS2, a country that has human rights issues and is currently occupying a large patch of another country..).

&gt;Gosh, you clearly haven't looked at the details in the matter. If you would read the complete position paper, it clearly is related to usage of the specific weapon system in violation of international humanitarian law. The problem is not with exporting to generally authoritarian states.

I have and again, the UK and France appear to disagree on whether it is being used in the violation of international humanitarian law. But again, if we are acting morally, how on earth can Germany justify selling arms to one state that likely breaches international law but not others? The issue appears to be more about public understanding and public interest than the impact.

&gt;It's also a quite redundant statement you make here. It's plain for the world to see that the interpretation of rules differs between Germany and the UK. We don't need anyone to state that. The question is rather, is the UK honestly applying arms export rules and for some reason not considering the application of Eurofighters in Yemen problematic or is it rather exclusively driven by commercial profit? That's the interesting facet, not the mere observation that there's a disagreement here. That's a general problem and issue with your comments, you make these redundant observations/statements no one is disputing in the first place.

To be fair, my point is simply that German taking this view makes it entirely reasonable for the UK and France (and others..) to exclude Germany from future arms projects.  You seem to be suggesting that the German position should be taken as fact, and so applied by other countries (and so excluding Germany isn't necessary), so I thought it was important to point out that the difference of opinion is why Germany will find itself excluded from future projects.",North West Macedonia,/r/europe/comments/awz1mi/airbus_eyes_warplane_with_no_german_parts_after/ehrltyv/,-ah,1551708408

883,"We cannot yet know for certain whether charges will indeed be brought against the four ex-paras who were at Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. But if it is true ‚Äì as seems very likely ‚Äì that on March 14 they are charged with a number of offences, including murder, then I believe there will be a storm of utter fury from the public. And as that storm rages, some objections to the prosecution will be good; some will be frankly less good. It is important, therefore, to focus on what is truly nauseating in this affair.

Yes, it is incredible that we are on the verge of putting these old men on trial for crimes that are alleged to have been committed 47 years ago ‚Äì and yet that is not the worst feature of the business, and certainly no reason, in principle, for stopping the trial. You could point out ‚Äì and I would agree ‚Äì that the mere lapse of time should be no protection for anyone guilty of a serious offence.

We pursue war criminals to the ends of the earth. Only the other day it was announced that an ex-Labour peer is to appear in court later this month charged for sex offences he is alleged to have committed in the 1970s. I have no idea as to the strength of the case against him ‚Äì but if he was guilty then he is guilty now. No one should escape justice ‚Äì where the offence is grave - just because it was all so long ago. And I am afraid that rule must apply to British soldiers as much as to anyone else.

Yes, it feels sickening that we are persecuting these elderly men for doing what they thought was their duty ‚Äì in uniform, under orders, as members of the Parachute Regiment. Yes it seems brutal and unfair that we should send them there as young men, require them to keep order in dangerous and volatile circumstances ‚Äì and then penalise them decades later for a misjudgement they may have made in the pressure of the moment. Never forget that vital moral distinction: these men were not terrorists.

They did not get up in the morning with the intention of killing and maiming innocent civilians. What kind of a world is it ‚Äì you may ask ‚Äì where we can put former squaddies in the dock for murder, and simultaneously tell IRA killers that they can get away with it? Are we really proposing to send old soldiers to die in jail ‚Äì after we gave dozens of wanted terrorists a get-out-of-jail-free card under the Good Friday Agreement? Is that balanced? Is that fair?

Well, of course it isn‚Äôt. And yet I am afraid ‚Äì again ‚Äì that this asymmetry does not in itself amount to a sufficient objection to a trial. We cannot know what really happened on that appalling day in 1972. I wasn‚Äôt there; you ‚Äì in all likelihood ‚Äì were not there. It wasn‚Äôt our finger crooked around the trigger. We can‚Äôt know exactly what impulses and calculations coursed through the minds of those young soldiers.

We therefore cannot rule out the awful possibility that the deaths of those 14 protesters ‚Äì and the injuries sustained by 14 more ‚Äì were more than just the horrific result of a concatenation of confusion and panic. We must accept that there is at least the possibility of a serious crime, and no one ‚Äì not even an essentially loyal and well-meaning British soldier ‚Äì should in principle be exempt from justice.

No ‚Äì if these men are put on trial for murder, it will be an absolute outrage not because they are old, and may die in jail; not because Bloody Sunday took place 47 years ago; not because they were serving soldiers up against bomb throwers.

The reason this whole thing stinks to high heaven ‚Äì and the reason it should be denounced ‚Äì is that there is absolutely nothing new for any trial to discover. There is no new testimony to hear. There are no new facts ‚Äì no DNA breakthrough, no new theory of ballistics ‚Äì to bring before the court. The whole thing has been chewed and chewed again, supermasticated to oblivion.

It is not as though the United Kingdom has just undergone some kind of democratic revolution ‚Äì overthrowing a tyranny and enabling for the first time the trying of historic crimes that have been suppressed by the regime. We have had stable and continuous government in this country ‚Äì under the rule of law ‚Äì and in the last 47 years we have gone to quite astonishing lengths to get at the truth.

We had the Widgery inquiry; and even if that was held to be a whitewash we then had the Saville Inquiry, set up by the Blair government. Those proceedings lasted nine years. They cost ¬£200m. I have come across lawyers whose mortgages have been paid and whose children have been educated thanks to the Saville Inquiry. These lawyers gave every appearance of being highly intelligent and hardworking. Did they really miss some crucial detail? Did they fail in their cross-examination?

No one has made any such suggestion. So much of the evidence has been destroyed since 1972; and there is so much doubt about who did what and which bullet went where that the chances of a conviction are surely remote ‚Äì and so we are driven to ask what the hell we are doing? And the answer is that it is not about justice. It is about politics.

Why have we set up this new ‚ÄúHistorical Investigations Unit‚Äù that has pushed to reopen the Bloody Sunday inquiry? The objective is not to get to the truth of this episode, or any other.

It is just meant to be a concession to Sinn Fein, a gesture to nationalist feeling, part of the complex politics of restarting provincial government at Stormont. It will cost millions. It will achieve nothing except the misery of a few old men. It will serve as a terrible warning to anyone thinking of joining the services: that politics sometimes trumps justice ‚Äì and when politics trumps justice, the members of the armed services will know that they are on their own.

They will know that they cannot rely on the Army, the MOD, the politicians or anyone else to protect them or show common sense.

&gt;FRANCEINFO INVESTIGATION. Economic war: how American justice targets foreign companies

&gt;Under the guise of fighting corruption, the Americans are weakening some strategic companies to better position themselves in global markets.

&gt;Alcatel, Alstom, Technip, Total, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale and BNP Paribas, all of these French companies have been sued by the American courts for corruption or the circumvention of embargoes in recent years. 

&gt;France is not the only one concerned. In recent years, more than $20 billion in fines have been imposed by the US courts on European companies.""

&gt;An underground economic warfare

&gt;These companies were prosecuted on the basis of the ""extraterritoriality of American law"": laws that allow non-US companies to be prosecuted abroad, provided they have a link with the United States. Except that this link is extremely broad since it is sufficient for companies to carry out a transaction in dollars or use American technology for legal action to be taken. 

&gt;""All you need to do is use a microchip, an iPhone, a web host or an American server to find yourself under American law."" Herv√© Juvin, economist at franceinfo

&gt;The Americans' interest is to keep out competitors and maintain the advantage, especially against the Chinese, in what could be called the ""new economic war"": ""It is a deliberate strategy of the United States to network all its intelligence agencies and justice in order to wage a real economic war on its competitors,"" said former Republican MP Pierre Lellouche, who chaired a parliamentary information mission on the subject in 2016. ""This economic war is dressed with the best intentions in the world,"" he continues.

&gt;""Americans can use the anti-corruption weapon if they want to prevent a competitor from selling to the Russians or the Chinese,"" says economist Herv√© Juvin. This is particularly the case with Alstom: in the eyes of the Americans, Alstom should not have established a partnership and technology transfer with the Chinese.""

&gt;The Alstom case 

&gt;The Alstom case is an emblematic example of this American strategy. On 22 December 2014, the French company was ordered by the American courts to pay a record fine of 772 million dollars for acts of corruption. In the meantime, Alstom was bought by the American General Electric, under the nose and beard of the French government.

&gt;The story begins in 2011, when Americans are interested in bribes paid by Alstom in Indonesia. By broadening their investigation, they discover a system of widespread corruption within the company. In 2013, they arrested one of the company's executives and put pressure on Alstom. Finally, Alstom decided to plead guilty and reached an agreement with the American courts.

&gt;On 11 March 2015, Alstom's CEO assured the National Assembly's Economic Affairs Committee that there was no causal link between the sale and this corruption case. ""The American authorities were only informed of the existence of this project at the same time as you. Renounce this fantasy of American judicial control over us: there has been no conspiracy, collusion or anything,"" Patrick Kron said.

&gt;""Renounce this fantasy of the American judicial authorities taking control of us."" Patrick Kron, Alstom's CEO in 2015 in the National Assembly

&gt;This version of the facts is contested by many informed observers of the case, such as journalist Jean-Michel Quatrepoint, author of a counter-investigation on this case. The proof, according to him, ""is that Patrick Kron and his legal director were able to travel twice to the United States, without being worried, to negotiate the details of this sale.  

&gt;What supports this thesis is the coincidence of dates: the American courts impose the fine against Alstom three days after the general shareholders' meeting, which validates General Electric's takeover of Alstom, and grants Patrick Kron a bonus of ‚Ç¨4 million. In addition, the American group had Alstom in its sights for some time. ""Everything was done to inform the American authorities of this behaviour and, if necessary, to be able to buy out certain divisions if the opportunity arose,"" testified Pierre Laporte, a former Alstom and General Electric executive, on franceinfo.

&gt;Tetanized French companies

&gt;Another cause of American sanctions: non-compliance with embargoes. Here, procedures are not always devoid of geopolitical ulterior motives. For example, BNP-Paribas was fined $9 billion in 2014 for failing to comply with the embargoes with Cuba and Iran. ""We paid for sanctions that we did not recognize,"" says Pierre Lellouche. However, since the payment of this fine, the Americans have approached Cuba and lifted the sanctions against Sudan! They should pay us back that $9 billion.""

&gt;""It shows that when the Americans have decided to sanction one country, all the others must align themselves."" Pierre Lellouche, former MP LR

&gt;Another example: despite a political agreement with the United States, European companies still do not dare to invest in Iran. ""French companies are being held back while the embargo is officially lifted,"" says former PS MP Karine Berger, rapporteur for the parliamentary mission on the extraterritoriality of American law.

&gt;On the American side, we value all these outrageous criticisms. ""There is no war against Europe or anyone else,"" replied American lawyer Joseph Smallhoover of the firm Bryan Cave, also representative of the Democratic Party in France.  

&gt;""There is no conspiracy. The United States is only defending its interests."" Joseph Smallhoover, representative of the American Democratic Party in France

&gt;However, companies that find themselves in American radars are almost obliged to cooperate, otherwise they will no longer work with the United States and will lose, for example, their banking licence.",frankreich,/r/europe/comments/ax5hwm/economic_war_how_american_justice_targets_foreign/ehrb7xo/,ilvoitpaslerapport,1551693985
974,"&gt;A very expensive ""compliance""

&gt;Once they agree to plead guilty in order to avoid a trial, they must comply with US regulatory standards. ""Compliance can cost several times the fine,"" says Herv√© Juvin, who tells us that a major European industrialist told him he had paid ""more than 2 billion euros.

&gt;""It is the company that conducts the investigation and seeks its own evidence of its own guilt,"" says lawyer Pierre Servan-Schreiber, co-author of the book Deals of Justice. The American market for globalized obedience (PUF, 2013). The amount of the fine is negotiated with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).

&gt;Then, the company is generally placed under surveillance. This is called the ""monitoring"" phase: an expert in the US justice system is appointed for three years to monitor the company's performance and ensure that it meets all its compliance obligations. ""He must report annually to the US Department of Justice,"" explains former Interdepartmental Delegate for Economic Intelligence Claude Revel.

&gt;""As I have noted, this report may contain confidential information."" Claude Revel, former inter-ministerial delegate for Economic Intelligence

&gt;Lawyer Laurent Cohen-Tanugi was an instructor at Alcatel. He refuses to talk about agreed espionage and assures that ""there was no strategic data"" in his reports which were ""reviewed and approved by the French authorities"". According to him, ""these are international good practices if we want to fight corruption"".

&gt;This internationalized pursuit of corruption has actually become a lucrative market for Anglo-Saxon business firms and the US administration. ""Fine money finances the staff of all the administrations involved in this anti-corruption fight,"" says journalist Jean-Michel Quatrepoint. These staff are motivated because the higher the fine, the more money they receive. It's the bounty hunter system!""

&gt;An independence in question

&gt;The Alstom case raises real questions of independence because it is a strategic company, particularly in the nuclear sector. ""The sale of Alstom to General Electric deprives us of strategic autonomy on two essential points: turbines for nuclear submarines, surface ships, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, as well as civil nuclear power plants,"" explains the director of the French Intelligence Research Centre, √âric Den√©c√©, who investigated the case.

&gt;""For Alstom, there was a real betrayal of the French elites"". √âric Den√©c√©, Director of the Centre fran√ßais de recherche sur le renseignement

&gt;A parliamentary committee of inquiry into the state's industrial policy has decided to take up the whole story. On 13 December 2017, the former Minister of Economy, Arnaud Montebourg, testified before this committee.  ""In retrospect, I understood much better what Mr. Kron's situation was,"" said Arnaud Montebourg. There was no possible discussion. I believe that Mr. Kron was under judicial pressure from a state. I remind you that Mr. Kron came to see me, and said to me: ""If you don't accept the agreement with General Electric, I'll immediately give you a social plan of 5,000 people!'"".

&gt;General Electric had promised to create 1,000 jobs in France by 2018. For the time being, the American group is announcing job cuts in Europe and 345 jobs are threatened at the Grenoble site. As for Alstom's transport branch, it has just merged with the German Siemens.

&gt;With regard to the judicial aspect, while the senior managers no longer have to worry about anything, Alstom's manager, Fr√©d√©ric Pierucci, who was arrested in 2014 for 14 months, was again incarcerated last September for 12 months. His relatives are asking for him to be transferred to French soil. The deputy LR Olivier Marleix, who chairs the commission of inquiry on the State's industrial policy, has just written to the President of the Republic to this effect.

&gt;Airbus, Areva, Lafarge.... Who's next?

&gt;In France, among the next companies likely to be concerned by the American courts, we can first mention Airbus. The aircraft manufacturer has reported itself to the American authorities while it is already under investigation on suspicions of corruption in France and England. 

&gt;There is also the case of Areva, which bought the Canadian company Uramin at a price that seemed overvalued. ""At the end of 2016, a file was filed with the FBI on the Uramin case,"" said business journalist Thierry Gadault. The operation was carried out in dollars, some of the actors in this case are Americans, Uramin held a decisive general meeting in New York: all the criteria are met for the American anti-corruption law to be activated.""

&gt;Lafarge could also be concerned. The French-Swiss cement company is already being prosecuted by the French courts on suspicion of having paid money to the Islamic state group in Syria to continue operating. The group asked the American firm Baker Mac Kenzie to produce an audit report that franceinfo was able to consult.

&gt;In this ""confidential"" document, it is discovered that the company is clearly alerted to legal risks in the United States: ""Lafarge's Syrian subsidiary has opened accounts denominated in US dollars with the following banks: Audi Bank Syria, Audi Bank Lebanon and Al-Baraka Bank in Syria, is indicated in this report. These accounts were used to make and receive many payments in US dollars, including commissions.""

&gt;""These payments correspond to transfers probably processed by a US financial institution and are potentially subject to US sanctions."" Extract from the audit report commissioned by Lafarge 

&gt;A law to deter the United States

&gt;What response can France provide to this American strategy? ""The French political class tends to consider that the Americans are our friends and that in the name of friendship we can forgive them everything and hide everything,"" says former MP Bernard Carayon, who wrote a report on economic intelligence in 2003 at the request of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. The left and right are blind and powerless.""

&gt;""In the economic war, there are no friends. There are only competitors and occasional partners."" Bernard Carayon, former LR deputy

&gt;In their parliamentary report, published in 2016, MPs Pierre Lellouche and Karine Berger wrote that ""a balance of power must be established"" with the United States in order to ""act on equal terms"". They also state that ""the mission considers it necessary to argue with the United States that certain practices have become abusive and that France will no longer accept them"".

&gt;The recent Sapin II law is intended to be a response to this situation, by placing itself on the American side. For example, through the ""public interest agreement"", the company can negotiate a fine to avoid a lawsuit. This is what happened recently with the HSBC bank, which paid a fine of 300 million euros. It also introduces an extraterritorial provision that extends the prosecution of corruption abroad. ""An American company that generates revenue in France and has committed acts of corruption in Africa, for example, could now be prosecuted by the French courts,"" said former PS MP Karine Berger. 

&gt;Another new feature is the creation of a French anti-corruption agency that works upstream with companies. ""We have a preventive role, but we do not have control of the stick, i.e. prosecution,"" regrets the director of the Anti-Corruption Agency, Charles Duchaine. However, the Americans are collecting massive amounts of information and then putting some companies in difficulty.""

&gt;""Today, unfortunately, France does not have the same means of investigation as the United States."" Charles Duchaine, Director of the French Anti-Corruption Agency

&gt;Can this new system deter Americans from continuing to destabilize European companies? ""The objective of the Sapin II law is to create a sufficiently important sanction system so that France can tell the United States that the work has already been done and that there is no longer any need to initiate new prosecutions,"" said lawyer David P√®re. But it's a political wish. There is no certainty.""

And yes some NGOs, not all, transfer people from smugglers boats to their own ships. I don't think that's a determinant factor for illegal immigration, Europe's unclear stance is. But it is sick to see activists that supposedly fight for human rights to have any form of cooperation with traffickers who do unspeakable crimes like this: [Migrant crisis: Smugglers 'deliberately holed boat', says survivor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34251539) and this: [Migrant crisis: Smugglers 'deliberately holed boat', says survivor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34251539)

1073,"&gt;Due to license agreements, most of it does not need to be filtered anyway.

Nonsense, the platform is responsible for every upload. Therefore it will need to filter everything.

&gt;For other things, the rights holder first needs to give the necessary information to the platform, so just like with the current situation things get removed after a complaint.

This just means that big, organized, commercial rightsholders will have the advantage over individual citizens that have copyright.

&gt;Major difference being that platforms are then expected to take best efforts to also prevent repeat uploads. Most memes are images, these are easier to filter compared to video.

So you admit that filters will be implemented.

&gt;Will there be false positives in an automated setup? Sure. Hire more people to deal with it.

Given that those are commercial companies, and the rights infringed are those of ordinary citizens, why do you think that would happen? There is no penalty for excessive filtering, only for insufficient filtering.

As far as those companies are concerned they can block any citizen that is not a commerical organization, because it doesn't impact their bottom line.

&gt;If your business is so large, that the scale means you can no longer be responsible for what happens on it, you got a problem and an unsustainable business model. The platforms in question are part of businesses making tens of billions in profit every year, if not more. They can adapt and don't need people defending them.

It's not the platforms that will be impacted, but the users. The platforms will be fine, because they have money.

1207,"Yes that is true, and for that it is important to understand, in the German context, what marriage refers to and why this word is so contested, while civil unions are not.

Marriage and family receive special protection under Article 6 Paragraph 1 of the German constitution, this protection is what was sought by legalising gay marriage. Marriage itself refers to a 2 person union, that may or may not have children, while family refers to couples that already have children. Gay couples were already protected by this article if they had children, but protecting a union that does not have children and can't create any to rise the birth rate, does not need this special status, as it specifically is about the birth rate in the eyes of conservatives. Civil unions were introduced to provide all necessary regulations, such as hospital visitation rights, or the right to not incriminate your spouse in front of a court, to enable and honour the contributions that gay couples have to society, those were the rights that didn't exist in America for example, they already existed regardless of gay marriage in Germany.

I addressed the issue with surrogacy in my post, [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Maternidad_subrogada_situaci%C3%B3n_legal.PNG) is a map with the countries that either legalize or don't encourage surrogacy, in case of Western Europe, that is out of feminist concerns, to not exploit the financial situation of women from Ukraine or India, that have to literally sell the child they carried, which is seen as inhumane. There may be some cases of altruistic surrogacy, where a lesbian and a gay couple assist each other, but those are so rare and unreliable, that they receive a different legal status, there won't be any accidental pregnancies for example, using this method.

Orphans are not the main concerns, encouraging the birth of new children is for this specific law, civil unions can enable adoption too. There is also no shortage of people that want to adopt, I think that ratio was something like 10:1 couples to orphans.

The reason for the BGH ruling is so that literally this doesn't happen.

Yes it's only like 0.1% of the population but it still affects many thousands of people.

Again it's literally supporting your narrative of biological sex. I'm not sure why you ignore the fact that it's possible that people have literally both sexes due to genetic crazyness. The BGH hasn't ruled anything in regards to ones sexuality, there's no ""hetero"" or ""trans"" or ""pan"" or whatever entry. Just biological sex.

1412,"1. Correct. Smugglers and traffickers from Africa and Turkey (even Erdogan supported trafficking openly by threatening that he would flood Europe with immigrants) are those who initiate illegal immigration, by running a multi-billion operation. EU has no jurisdiction in Africa and in Turkey and can't directly combat these networks.
2. But what Europe does with economic migrants is an indirect encouragement. After their asylum applications fail, they still stay for years, till deportation, enjoying free housing and welfare money. If that's not encouragement what is it? They live with the hope that some governments will decide to give them workers' visas and even if they don't get a visa and get eventually deported, in the meanwhile they will have earned a couple of thousands of Euros during their stay. This situation is unacceptable, because funds that are allocated for the support of refuges go to economic migrants, compromising the quality of life of genuine refugees. Furthermore, refugees end up in overcrowded camps and housing facilities for the same reason.

The stance of Europe it totally absurd. After a failed asylum request the person should be given a work visa in a short time if the government wished to allow him to stay or otherwise he should get deported. Prolonging his stay as an illegal immigrant does not make any sense and is not beneficial neither for the immigrant, who faces an uncertain future, nor for the country which spends refugee funds to people who are not legally entitled to receive them.",,/r/europe/comments/awvp9k/on_greek_island_of_lesbos_migrants_dreams_turn_to/ehqefgs/,JustAPasserByGuy,1551657559

1457,"&gt; Inequality in choices isnt directly bad, lol.

The whole point of providing for parental leave is to make those choices real *choices* to begin with instead of thinly veiled justifications for institutional necessities. 

Here's an example, not from Mongolia, but from the heart of the developed world: Until the early 2000s, there was no such thing as parental leave in Germany as we only had *maternity* leave. After parental leave was finally introduced, almost nothing changes and was still mostly women who took it, despite the fact that males got the exact same benefits as females. 

Why? Because the social stigma associated with it was pretty much alive still. ""How am I to face my muckers if I'm the only one to ever stay home with the kids?"" - That's why.

Which is quite strange since men's rights activits had been complaining for ages that men are getting the short end of the stick all over place (you know, ""the fatherless society"" an such), yet almost none of them took the opportunity when they finally had it. 

&gt; 50% of perpetrators are female yet 90% of those prosecuted are male.

1529,"l think, you are wrong, when you think that there is a coherent and clear opinion about the EU in the UK and that this has given the result. Look at the public debate in the UK about Brexit, there is at least three different parties with three different outcomes for this. These haven't build after the referendum, those were there long before.
An other clear example is the split of 50:50, it's a good hint about a random result.

In reality, the outcome of the referendum was about the internal situation in the UK. And was shaped by the domestic politics of the last 40 years.
Even the reason for the referendum itself was, that Cameron wanted to kill his internal critics.





&gt; * Explicitly guarantee that the process of federalization will involve a referendum at some point prior to it happening.

That wouldn't work. There is no plan for federalization, so you can't have a single vote about this. The EU is a work in progress and nobody knows, when it's finished and what's the result. And by the way, a referendum isn't really democratic.

&gt; * In retrospect, while free movement has integration benefits,

The free movement isn't an option, which the EU is free to implement or not.
The biggest myth is that there are four different parts of the single market.
The truth is, that there is only one. As an example freedom of service and freedom of labour differs only how you define who is employed and who is self-employed. 


&gt; Suppose Britons had been given the option of an N% income tax to fund policy to reduce movement, like via subsidizing businesses in Poland or something. 

Honestly, this is a really stupid idea.

First you don't get a democratic mandate for this and that is true in at least three ways.

Second, economically it will not work. It's the old question, can you push money in a nonprofitable thing to make it profitable. 
The reality is, only to a small point. This counts for businesses, regions and also countries. Look up the German Solidarity Surcharge.


Thirth, with this idea you destroy your own labour market and so you destroy your own country. You force firms to go where they get their workforces and not get their workforces to them. And this is a big problem and it doesn't acount for future developments.

&gt; * I suspect that most people objected to immigrants that lived near them and directly competed for work with them in their neighborhood. 

Those regions with the smallest parts of immigrats are those with the highest opinions against them. A hard indicator that they don't object their neighbours, they object some visions which they have about things they don't know.

&gt; We also know that the most opposition was generated in areas with rapid changes in the percent composition of immigrants, not in the absolute level. 

Where did you get that?

&gt; * Probably some form of better way for the EU to market itself...

&gt; * Merkel/Macron whatever national leaders should not act as the public face of the EU or be presented as being the ones negotiating for anything that affects it as a whole...

This is all right, the problem is until the last decade the EU was more or less an only tecnocratic institution. 
The EU is at a point, where it has to get more political. But this also carries more risks, 
because you need genuine european politicians. Not somebody which gets his job because he is a party friend of a nation leader. Somebody, who made his election campain european wide.
And than imagine Juncker campaining in Hungary. This will get messy.

Fun fact Juncker and Tusk are the first politicians, who gave the EU something like political faces.

It's very hypocritical of you to think if some product is amoral and for this it must to be banned. The fur farms are closed ecosystems, this means no harm to the wild animal population.

Also keep in mind that even if the boycotts were not huge, they were probably more talked about in France because of the anti american feeling at that time. (A lot of French people viewed and continue to view American culture as too aggressive, putting at risk their own way of life (see communist party and wine lobbies alliance against coca cola in the 50's, for one example)).

Yes if greece had left the eurozone some argue they would have been able to pay off their debts through:

- being able to devalue their currency boosting exports and attracting increased revenue from tourism 
- devaluing their currency and increasing the demand for goods produced internally
- making it harder for the country's best and brightest to leave greece to work elsewhere
- allowing greece to set their own monetary policy and not depend on the average european interest rate

1721,"&gt;In England, women made up only 5% of people starting apprenticeship in construction, planning and the built environment. In contrast, women were over-represented in apprenticeships in poorly paid sectors, such as hairdressing and early-years care. They made up 94% of all apprenticeship starts in child development and wellbeing in England last year.

I don't think this is a problem of employers picking one over the other, but shows a clear difference in which type of jobs men and women are looking at. This is an upbringing and schooling issue first, not a workplace one. You can't really expect more even numbers if there are simply no women wanting to go intro construction in the first place, and men not wanting to become hairdressers. I highly doubt that even if employers went actively looking they would find a large number of women for construction or men wanting to do hairdressing.

1736,"&gt; The only reason the US cares about China's installation of communication infrastructure is because they're protecting their own espionage capabilities.

I mean, I have no doubts that everyone is spying on everyone in the world. Even allied countries are spying on each other. But us having our critical infrastructure build by China does not only mean that they could spy on us more than they can now. It also means that they could possibly mess with our systems, cripple their functions, essentially in times of high tensions, we would be extremely vulnerable towards them. From the US perspective, we'd hardly be their allies at that point. If your allies can easily be exploited by your biggest rival, then what are those allies even for to you?

It would be the same the other way around. Imagine if the US critical infrastructure was vulnerable towards Russia - do you think the CEE countries would still find the US a trustworthy ally in that situation?

&gt; A trade war as a tactic to change a trade deal is nonsensical

Not necessarily. Carrots and sticks are a part of any kind of negotiations. Even though I agree that the sticks that the US is using in this negotiation are very tough and should not be used between allies at all. Unfortunately Trump has a very transactional idea of international relations and feel like the EU, particulary Germany, has been taken advantage of the US. And he is not absolutely wrong about that given how little effort Germany puts into the collective defense of NATO.

Frankly speaking I see these EU-US disputes as something where both sides have some truth in what they say and I agree that Trump is taking it too far and threatens way too much but at the same time, European countries are also not necessarily doing as much as they could to preserve the ties. But I can sort of understand that in the case of Western European countries, because you simply do not value your ties with the US as much. I just hope that the current disagreements do not get out of hand and do not affect our own relation with the US (and that of other CEE countries) because for US, being on good terms with the US is quite important.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/awrywm/translated_from_german_industrial_policy_a_new_eu/ehpmlcp/,kristynaZ,1551636296

1799,"&gt;Man does not live by bread alone. I have known millionaires starving for lack of the nutriment which alone can sustain all that is human in man, and I know workmen, and many so-called poor men, who revel in luxuries beyond the power of those millionaires to reach. It is the mind that makes the body rich. There is no class so pitiably wretched as that which possesses money and nothing else. Money can only be the useful drudge of things immeasurably higher than itself. Exalted beyond this, as it sometimes is, it remains Caliban still and still plays the beast. My aspirations take a higher flight. Mine be it to have contributed to the enlightenment and the joys of the mind, to the things of the spirit, to all that tends to bring into the lives of the toilers of Pittsburgh sweetness and light. I hold this the noblest possible use of wealth.

A clue here. You actually GET med insurance with that money whereas in Greece the health system is total crap unless you got shit loads of money.
And don't forget about how you deduct so many things from your tax that are work related.in Greece these are minimal.

The 1453 siege, the 1821 revolution, various massacres and atrocities during said revolution. The ethnic cleansing and slaughter of ethnic Greeks of Asia Minor after the incredibly idiotic Greco-Turkish war (Immigrants of which were grossly mistreated upon landing in Greece as well). Not to mention atrocities committed against Turks by Greek forces upon landing in Turkey. Then we have Cyprus, territorial disputes in the Aegean and yes, daily airspace violations. And I'm sure I've forgotten bits and pieces.

The most recent ones I can somewhat understand are Cyprus and the violations. But then, Cyprus wasn't just Turkey, that was also a result of saber rattling on behalf of the dictatorship. That one's also a soft spot for me because a friend of mine, older gentleman served and lost his legs in Cyprus. Then there were unsupported paratrooper raids that went horribly wrong due to incredible failures in leadership.

And now, after the attempted coup in Turkey, and the 2015 elections in Greece, tensions have mounted because A. Turkey has slowly started becoming more authoritarian and conservative and B. Greece hasn't exhibited any kind of diplomatic tact or unity since 2015. You various heads of office issuing contradicting statements while part of the same government. Doesn't matter if it's the PM, Foreign Minister, Defense Minister or President. One is supposedly threatening the Turkish Government while the other appears more non-confrontational. Internal Turkish turmoil means that people need an easy target.

1970,"&gt; There seems to be an eerie silence and lack of knowledge about the topic. 

It's not really eerie, it's by design of those who claim to oppose the directive.

Groups like the EFF or MEPs like Julia Reda straight up lie about the details in order to get the wider discourse more angry and opposed about it, seemingly with the idea that the wider public can't be trusted to build a nuanced understanding of the issue, and instead should just be told to be angry.

This does lead to the problem you're getting at; Attention is focused on the wrong things now. The paragraphs of article 13 talking about upload filters have been amended to make the demands much less strict, under a fairly literal reading even outright banning such filters, leading to politicians just discarding all complaints about the directive that still complain about ""meme bans"" or mandatory filters on everything.

The second one is pharmaceuticals 2 of which Glaxosmith klein and Astrazeneca are British owned, 5 of which e.g. Novartis, Pfizer, Hoffman La-Roche etc are not UK owned but present there, though less affected all rely the EU-US agreement on drug safety standards (Some replaceable by US companies, though given the nature of IP this industry will be less affected). Moreover all rely on raw material imports from the EU.

The Third largest export to the US is power generators again all reliant on component imports from the EU. So this dependency graph is somewhat misleading given the interconnectedness of exports to RoW countries and EU27 industry or EU agreements

Regions are completely separate by design. every service has a separate control plane for every single region. This is so that an error in one region cannot propagate to other regions.

In Germany there is only one region, Frankfurt (eu-central-1).

Within a regional are multiple, usually three, availability zones. Every availability zone consists of multiple tightly coupled data centers, with low latency between them. Availability zones are decoupled from each other so that a failure in one availability zone will not propagate to other availability zones but not to the extent that they do it with regions.

1. Trump's characterization of why the wall is needed ""they are rapists"" makes it harder to build a consensus across the political isle for it.

2. Latino's have grown in significance as part of the Democratic base.

3. Obama for example ramped up deportations  to get to a point where he had the credibility to do bipartisan immigration reform, such reform failed. 

4. Increased border enforcement is actually supported by a decent chunk of Congressional Democrats, even if they'll insist on ""no wall"", at least in regards to rhetoric.

5. Democrats offered Trump a deal last November when he ended DACA which would have given him ~$20b wall funding for a path to citizenship for the Dreamers (and some protection for their parents), Trump would eventually oppose that deal, making it harder for Democrats to support another similar deal and by extension the wall at all.

...but yes, a major factor in all this is that opposition to Trump and general polarization drives Democrats into opposing his wall but their opposition isn't nearly as categorical as you might think.

**Berlin, Brussels.** Angela Merkel has discovered the topic of industrial policy. In Brussels she had requested that the EU heads of government ""hold a discussion about Europe as an industrial location"", the Chancellor said recently.

At the EU summit at the end of March, a reorientation of industrial policy will be discussed, especially with a view to China. ""Five years ago, the member states were still divided and na√Øve in their relations with China"", says Cl√©ment Beaune, European Affairs Advisor to French President Emmanuel Macron, ""now the time for naivety is over"".

It is very important that Europe gives itself something like an industrial strategy,"" Allianz boss Oliver B√§te stresses in an interview with the Handelsblatt. So far, Europe has been acting ""somewhat naively"" on this issue.

Other CEOs are also worried that Europe could lose touch. ""If the EU does not act strategically together, Europe will be left behind,"" warned Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing. Dependencies are becoming more entrenched, ""we must achieve results soon,"" warns telecoms boss Timotheus H√∂ttges.

Politicians have heard the wake-up call of the economy. France and Germany are setting the pace in EU competition law, Europe wants to find a common strategy for China. 

Because the future is at the other end of the world. Just as the 20th century was an Atlantic, shaped by relations between the USA and Europe, the 21st century will be a Pacific, with the USA and China as the key players. For this reason alone, Europeans are forced to rethink their foreign policy assumptions.

Europe has been struggling with this for a long time. It was based on the belief that democracy and a market economy would gradually spread throughout the world and that geopolitics were yesterday's politics. Yet Europeans are now realising that they were wrong. The present resembles a past that was believed to have been overcome.

The ""architecture of the world"" has come under pressure from a ""rivalry between great powers"", Merkel said at the Munich Security Conference. From the dream of the end of history: Europe is beginning to face up to the changes in world political reality.

China, the new great power in the Far East, is beginning to scare Europeans. Merkel put it this way in her Munich speech: ""No matter how diligent, no matter how great, no matter how great we can be - with 80 million inhabitants we won't be able to resist it if China decides that it doesn't want to have good relations with Germany anymore.",EU nation: /r/acteuropa,/r/europe/comments/awrywm/translated_from_german_industrial_policy_a_new_eu/ehorodo/,DFractalH,1551599944

2221,"German Chancellors and French Presidents travelled to Beijing with a large delegation of company heads to get the best orders for their country.

The political turnaround in Chinese-European relations is based on disillusioning experiences. The Europeans' hope that the growing prosperity in China will also liberalise the political system has not been fulfilled. At the same time, Europeans have seen China use its economic engagement in the EU for political influence.

Take Greece, for example: at the height of the euro debt crisis in 2009, Chinese investors took over the port of Piraeus. Six years later Greece vetoed the EU's denunciation of human rights violations in China and supported a UN declaration to this effect. According to Brussels, the government in Beijing is behind this.

Take the New Silk Road, for example: as part of its gigantic infrastructure project, China is attempting to tie 16 Eastern European states to itself economically and politically. Every year China's prime minister meets with Eastern European countries for a 16-plus-1 summit. EU states such as Hungary, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria are also present. China is giving them generous credit - for example for the construction of a super fast train between Budapest and Belgrade.

Chinese companies are building the rail line with Chinese workers. EU rules for tendering public contracts have been ignored, prompting the EU competition authority to call for action. The fact that China will later turn its investments in infrastructure projects into political influence has alarmed the governments in Berlin and Paris.

It was a mistake to sell the port of Athens or even a quarter of the Portuguese electricity grid to Chinese companies during the euro debt crisis, admits a high-ranking EU diplomat. The EU therefore now wants to review investments by third countries in terms of security policy. The European Parliament has just approved this ""investment screening"" with an overwhelming majority. France wants to tighten it even further.

""China's attitude to Europe is ambivalent,"" says Volker Perthes, Director of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics. ""On the one hand, Beijing likes to present itself as a friend and supporter of European integration. This is true insofar as it values and wants to preserve the EU as an economic partner with a strong internal market and a stable common currency. However, a politically unified Europe is not in China's interest.""

That is why the new strategy for dealing with China in Brussels should become a top priority. In the coming weeks, the 28 EU Commissioners will first discuss the issue in an orientation debate, followed by the foreign ministers of the EU states and, at their summit on 21 and 22 March, the heads of state and government. A high-ranking EU official said that Europe could not continue as before.

However, it should also not focus on curbing China, as the US government is currently trying to do. Experts think this is right: ""Europe must be careful not to be crushed between the two power blocs of the USA and China,"" says Frank Pieke, head of Merics, the Berlin-based China think tank. From an EU perspective, there are policy areas in which China is a partner with which Europe can cooperate.

But as a communist one-party system we also see China as a systemic rival, and here we have to draw clear red lines on a number of issues,"" stresses an EU representative. ""What we need is much more realism and a sober defence of the EU's interests. The previous strategy of dialogue has not produced the hoped-for results. The speeches of the Chinese may sound good, they say in Brussels, but nothing follows from them.

According to diplomats, Berlin wants to hold a summit during the German EU Council Presidency in the second half of 2020 at which President Xi Jinping is to meet the heads of government of the 27 EU countries for the first time. So far, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Council President Donald Tusk represent the Union at the EU-China summits.

Even the German economy, which has established close relations with China, is increasingly critical of the great power in the Far East. The idea that China is developing into a free market economy has now also been abandoned by companies. They are now counting on the political commitment of Germany and the EU in the fight for open markets.

Hubert Lienhard, outgoing head of the Asia-Pacific Committee of German Business (APA), welcomed the initiative of Economics Minister Peter Altmaier for an industrial policy strategy in an interview with the Handelsblatt, but warned: ""When we say that we are in competition between systems, on the one hand a free market economy and on the other a managed market economy in China, it is important to find the right balance in our country and not to choke off companies with too much regulation"".

Earlier this month, Altmaier presented his ""National Industrial Strategy 2030"". In it he called for a reform of competition law in order to facilitate the formation of ""European champions"" - a demand also made by the BDI in a position paper at the beginning of January.",EU nation: /r/acteuropa,/r/europe/comments/awrywm/translated_from_german_industrial_policy_a_new_eu/ehortan/,DFractalH,1551600145

2223,"On Tuesday, Lienhard will hand over the chairmanship of the APA to Joe Kaeser. The head of Siemens is considered more China-friendly; he once called the ""New Silk Road"" project the ""New WTO"". In the meantime, however, even Kaeser has moved away from his euphoric attitude to the initiative.

The new harshness of the German economy is also reflected in the debate about the involvement of the Chinese network suppliers Huawei and ZTE in the development of the new 5G mobile communications standard. ""There is no question that at 5G we have a networking of data and physical infrastructure that has never existed before,"" warns Lienhard. ""If someone can suck data there, that would be absolutely critical for the German economy."" He argues in favour of excluding Huawei from the 5G expansion in case of doubt.

China's leadership has recognised that Europe is taking a new course. In Berlin government circles there is talk of a charm offensive by the Chinese. Beijing is afraid that Germany will be too much on Washington's side in the trade dispute. When Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited China in December, China's President Xi Jinping promoted Europe's neutrality.

Europeans need a concept for the Pacific century, that much is certain. Also because the conflict between China and the USA would otherwise shift into the EU. ""Europe will be one of the poles of the multipolar international system or polarised itself,"" warns political scientist Perthes.

Yeah and that's why in the EFD all handgun magazines with 20+ rounds and rifle magazines with 10+ rounds are banned. Manufacturing one in your backyard or buying one in some other country is illegal. 

Thats is not the case in Switzerland because the Federal Council managed to get an exception clause for this given we use excusively 20rds mag in rifle competitions

&gt; Either that manufacture has a legally-transformative effect on the firearm itself (in which case all practical firearms become trivially made illegal by some workshop somewhere in the world producing a magazine) or it does not (in which case it presumably amounts to a fairly-toothless restriction on the gun manufacturer approving such manufacture that mostly annoys the law-abiding). 

You've found one of the numerous things that are retarded with the law. The point is that all guns accepting natively, without modification nor a modified magazine that doesn't exists before it's printed or modified, are *de facto* banned because of their capacity to ""store"" either 10+ or 20+ rounds.

2420,"Native population isn't ""changing"" as the change isn't a natural one coming from within such as what occurs through natural selection and adaption to the environment, the introduction of non-natives is referred to as a replacement. Just as the natives in america didn't change and suddenly become whiter from the 1490s to today, they were replaced by a non-native population.

""But I don't think it's correct to say that immigrants will be a majority since the descendants of immigrants will no longer be immigrants themselves.""

I didn't say immigrants would be the majority. I said non-natives, as in someone belonging to a non-native or non-european ethnicity. You misunderstanding me might be normal, native may sometime be used simply to refer to someone's birthplace, I used native to refer to the original ethnicity or ethnicities of that country or region.

And I always found it funny that before the statistics started showing that non-natives would almost definately be the majority, it was always replied to as nonsense, their numbers are way too low for that to ever happen. Now that it seems extremely likely that some european countries will have their natives becoming minorities, it's simply said that the immigrants and their children are the new natives and not to worry about it.

Secondly, Irishs might be a lot of things to the UK but not your brothers. 200 years ago you starved them to death. 100 years ago they fought you and won their independence on 2/3rd of their country. Barely 40 years ago your army was still shooting down unarmed civilians in the street.

Your country decided to leaves the Union that allowed the peace process without any regards on thE consequences for Ireland.

Therefore it will have to accept the consequences of that action. Which very possibly ends up very soon with an United Ireland.

Lastly, if both polls show a majority to stay in your union as you claim, why do you sounds so anxious and why do you care? The truth is, both place are divided and currently around the 50% mark. Considering the shitshow the negotiations were, the humiliation and the damage the brexit will do to the whole UK, it's almost certain a referundum in either place would ends up in a leave vote.

Nobody want to stay on a sinking ship. Nobody willingfully stay in an union that bring more harm than good. In fact it's not only Scotland and Northern Ireland you will lose but also a lot of your brains. Your educated Youth will move to the EU while your gamons stay and blame the world for their ignorance.

2703,"Random people from the village or how I would put it, uninformed masses are this way because their shier gap of reasonable information getting to them combined with the transition from communism to ... democracy, where one who was captive, and still is, of the Stockholm syndrome created by their communist upbringing, so they can't turn left or right with without the exact guidance of a higher authority.

In plain english all of their lives were told what to do, now they must some how pull themselves and try to see what they want ? Of course their grievances would be simplistic and a cat nip to populism, that can easily be manipulated. In 2016 PSD is the higher authority because it spoke their language ... they made simple ""promises"" about wages and pensions, populist nonetheless but in contrary to what PNL and to a length USR did. That's a lesson to be learned.

What we need, for who is willing is to reach out and try to create a form communities that would  start to expand their view, how they think about themselves, their community and their family. The 2020 USRPLUS I've seen in their latest Iasi political debate that they are talking about creating a some sort of townhall debates if they came into power, till then I at least will try to get more implicated as a volunteer promoting them as a alternative, not from a left or right political platform, but a platform without fucking corrupt people.

So I would't just say that they are lost cause.

On regards of Romania being a democracy under Iliescu, I would beg the difference, we were a democracy or at least we tried faking it and the evolution of our economy is good indicator as a progression over the last three decades on how Romania democracy evolved from a pseudo-democracy to a decent state of affairs in regards to our individual and collective rights.

Yes we did a piss poor on coping France Constitution, because we did it so poor that we decided not to copy their latest version and that proved to be a idiotic decision, but it's still something than nothing.

As someone who has a good grasp of how UK politics works, with a great-grandfather who was a devoted monarchist, a devoted communist grandfather and a hard core liberal as a father, I am a conservative liberal at heat and who have witnesses debate on this subject I can say that its not quite realistic by our state of affairs in 1990/91 to reinstate the monarchy. It's mainly due to the communist still beeing in charge by FSN and later PSDR. I will never forget, when I learned, how [how we treated Ion Ratiu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPIqYbvR6yQ), we were savage untrained rabid wolves that still loved populism and lies.

So trying to attain the UK form of government would have been hard to impossible considering the  at that time we were still brainwashed to look down on the bourgeoisie who who wanted to make their our national treasures. Also who would we have as Lords in the House of Peers ? The old communist ... the estranged enlightened minds that were political refuges under communism.

It's easy to think back and say we could have done this or that. But taking a good look at how Australia, Canada or New Zealand history the political course took just straights my view that it's hard to impossible from a 60 years horse beating over how awesome the communist is to go full monarchy especially to those in power that hated it. To attain that you need a somewhat educated masses beyond the substantial living, that understands and know their rights that were obtain by their own force. We are drooling at what other have achieved but we must understand that it was obtain over the course of at least 50 to 100 years or more.

But we don't have that time, but on the same time it's harder to a open economy to close itself. Venezuela it's not a good example, but if Brexit will happen UK will be a good example. The current state of economics will make wannabe new authoritarian regimes impossible at least in Europe and in the West and [they will stronghold you till you cave](https://www.google.com/search?q=standard+%26+poor%27s+romania+rating), just by a stroke of a pen.

&gt; Now it will take some more decades of fake democracy until something will change finally.

2810,"&gt;I was referring to the meeting on 11.3.1991 in the office of Jovic (Yugoslav Presidency - Serb), with Milosevic (President of Serbia, naturally a Serb) and general Kadijevic (Yugoslav Minister of Defence - also a Serb). At that meeting Milosevic demanded from Kadijevic that the army organize a coup, and Kadijevic consulted with the army, they refused.

Which never happened. And there is no proof it did. 

Kadijevic himself said so

&gt;**He added that neither he nor the JNA ever considered orchestrating a military coup to solve the Yugoslav crisis**

And... you go it the other way around, the guy that spoke of it, spoke about the army wanting to do a coup regardless of the wishes of the federal government and Serbia

&gt;This contrasted with comments by Yugoslavia's president Borisav Joviƒá who claimed** Kadijeviƒá and the army suggested a coup as a way out of the crisis but then changed their minds four days later.**[21]

And Kadijevic was half-croat, half-serb. Croatian mother, Serbian father. He was born and grew up in Croatia.

&gt;But, seriously, who cares and we're completely off topic?!? Either Serbia was fucked up by Slovenia, as you think, or Serbs did it to themselves, as I believe. In either case, Slovenia is now doing well, while Serbia is still up shit-creek and no one really cares any longer. Everyone has moved on ... so should we.

I'm just pointing out how you as a matter of fact, know nothing John Snow. But you say ""it's well known what happened""

&gt; Either Serbia was fucked up by Slovenia, as you think, or Serbs did it to themselves, as I believe.

I don't believe that. 

The entire point of my post is to disprove your theory of ""literate people going independent and joining the EU while illiterate people went to war"" 

Despite actions of the Slovene government Slovenia managed to get out with minimal casualties and damage. Not because of them, and they did so partly thanks to Serbia voting against the invasion and not wanting any military actions in Slovenia.

&gt; I'm not sure how Cuba is an example of a successful socialist state.

I never said you needed socialism in order to eliminate illiteracy. But socialist states have, for the most part, been successful in eliminating illiteracy whilst operating under a socialist government and economy. People live in poverty because, guess what, Cuba was a poor country before the revolution, and has been under incessant sanctions. The fact that it's one of the better Latin American countries to live in in spite of this is all the evidence I need to state that it is successful in spite of the odds.

2870,"Tesco is weird on the Polish market. They have very nice and clean stores, especially the biggest hypermarkets under the Tesco Extra brand, but they also have stores (especially smaller supermarkets) which total trash, like the Tesco supermarket in Piaseczno, where I live. It occupied and ex communist store pavillon closest to town, so despite Kaufland, Lidl, Biedronka and Auchan being just minutes further, had some clients. Mainly the elderly. And the unfortunate (read: drunks and junkies). I was actually desgusted to go there it was so dirty. They closed that down months after a furniture store next door was converted to Danish discount supermarket Netto, which looked a world apart.

I‚Äôm not sure why they chose to have cleannes and upkeep ranging from trash to top notch in Poland. Maybe they thought Poles won‚Äôt care or something, but overall now they look very bad compared to French and German counterparts and selling the chain and pulling out seems inevitable, the way it‚Äôs going. They might have a problem with the buyer for hypermarkets though, as mainly Auchan was buying everything they could in that segment, and when they purchased Real the anti-monopoly agency was mad and made them sell a few stores. If they try to purchase Tesco, the agency would have a fit. So the hypermarkets may be unsellable. The supermarkets could easily be sold to a combination of Lidl, Biedronka and others.

3007,"&gt;They come here because they believe they can live the life of a Westerner if they just work 40 hours a week like we do. Doesn‚Äôt help that the smugglers tell them that Germany needs workers and there‚Äôs a job waiting for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

What you describe here is the definition of an immigrant, not an asylum seeker. Whoever seeks a job should apply for a worker's visa according to the law, not for asylum. That's fraud. Asylum is reserved for those whose life or freedom is in danger for certain reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For the most part they don‚Äôt receive welfare because they love welfare, they receive it because they have no chances of finding a job because they have no marketable skills. So if you don‚Äôt hand out welfare you create even more beggars and thieves.

&amp;#x200B;

That constitutes discrimination, because citizens with the same level of skills don't enjoy the same welfare with unskilled immigrant job candidates. For example they are not offered free housing. E.g.:  [After 35 different second-hand apartments, Caroline has got a home in Sweden](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/avfpmf/after_35_different_secondhand_apartments_caroline/), while at the same time immigrants (not refugees) are offered free housing.

Croatia had larger population over a much larger landmass and for centuries had to constantly contend with Ottoman Turk invasions and even decades of occupation in parts of its territory, not to mention all the economic and demographic upheavals that come with that sort of instability, there were large influxes of Serbs and others fleeing westward who had to be accommodated and unlike Slovenia, they were primarily under Hungarian administration, which wasn't as helpful as the Austrians were in modernizing things.

Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, etc, were fucked by the Ottoman occupation, the Turks weren't interested in improving the lives of their subjects beyond what it took to keep them docile so they had to endure centuries of serfdom and oppression and only really began to catch up once they'd finally kicked to Turks out.

3103,"You haven't been following the EPPO so let me clarify why I said what I said. There are only 3 candidates for Public Prosecutor. The EU Parliament favorite is the Romanian Candidate, Kovesi. The Council favorite is the French Candidate, Bohnert. There is a German Candidate, Ritter, but he has won neither, and looks extremely unlikely to succeed further.   


Now the Romanian Candidate is receiving no government support, in fact the Romanian goverment is campaigning against her. And since the French candidate is fully backed by their government, the can offer promises to whoever supports him. So the Dutch Government and its respective parties, if they wanted to make a deal, would only find one in the French candidate, now that the German supported candidate isn't really in the race.  


So the question is if the Dutch Government would prefer to be bribed for their support by both the French and Romanian governments, or receive nothing and take a moral stance againt missuse of EU, and by extension Dutch, funds. Which do you think they will pick?

As for Bohnert, he has a sturdy CV, but is essentially a careerist who's never made it to the peaks of national prestige and instead is being sponsored by his government into a EU position through his connections. This follows the grand tradition of governments shoving their extras and failures into the EU.  


Kovesi on the other hand is there because she was shortlisted by the commitee formed by judges, national prosecutors and lawyers, and achieved first place in the Parliament despite having no national sponsors. And in fact has been fired and hounded by the Romanian government because her achievement in tackling corruptions and EU fund misuse was too effective and threatens doing so again.

- Totalitarian form of government
- Mass movements
- Role of the single party
- Degree of autonomy of judicial power
- Independence from the catholic church

The estado novo was undoubtedly an authoritarian single party state, however it had far more in common with previous Portuguese dictatorships, particularly those in the later stages of the monarchy, than it did with Italian or even German fascism.

So my guess would be that Scottish accession could happen within 1¬Ω to 4 years, depending mainly on how quickly they can construct a border with England.

If Scotland sticks with England long enough to ratify trade deals with the US or China or similar lapses below EU standards (so about half a year), add a year or two to that estimate.

The article which this discussion responds to uses that exact line of reasoning to argue that more men abuse women than vice versa, based on the murder statistics. 

/u/Bo-Katan simply applies that same reasoning to the murder of children by their parents, and /u/Hirudin provided sources. In doing so, they completed the burden of proof to the same standard as the original article.

My point is not that you made a claim, merely that if you believe that the necessary standard of evidence has not been met with the cited sources, as you appear to be doing, then neither has the original article and you should disregard the conclusions that resulted from that as well.

You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you are going to require a high standard of evidence before you accept an argument, you can't do it just for the arguments you disagree with.

3297,"&gt;You support an unsustainable system whereby Scotland's needs are subsidised by a London based government.

How is it unsustainable? It's been ongoing for close to a century.

It's not unusual, either. Every country has areas that contribute more and areas that receive more. In the US New Mexico receives most, a fiscal transfer of nearly $10,000 per person per year, New Jersey contributes the most, more than $3,000 per person. 

The idea that every part of a country has to contribute and receive the same amount is really bizarre. It's not implemented anywhere else in the world, why would it be implemented in Scotland?

&gt;From the usual anti independence menu of too small, too poor, or too stupid you throw your hat firmly into the too poor ring, without a hint of wondering why Scotland is too poor after being a part of a very successful UK for so long.

Allowing is not an action, it's the absence of it.. Not allowing is an action. It actually a threat of kidnapping or murder if you resist. Think about what happens if you resist there regulations. They'll fukking kill you.

And besides, if I want to destroy my life, I don't need your help. And if you don't like that the food isn't safe, buy only safe food. There is none? Stop being a fukking commie trying to force people to do sh*t and do it yourself. If there's such a demand for safe food, you should become a billionaire selling it. If there is no demand, you still don't have the right to force something on people that they don't care about.

3555,"&gt; AI will be in full swing for sure, unless there‚Äôs some massive issue in increasing our computing power that we‚Äôre yet to identify. Once you make an AI, you don‚Äôt have to make it again. It‚Äôs an infinitely reusable program, so once you have an AI that replaces basic accounting jobs you will suddenly lose accounting jobs within a few years at most.

That's assuming that the AI is all theoretical.

An AI running farming equipment requires us to produce all of the farming equipment. When stuff breaks it needs replacements, upgrades etc.

If you think we're talking about some Matrix/Her level AI then I think that's farther off than 2050.

&gt;Robots however, will take much longer and will primarily focus on products with high level of detail and manufacturing costs like cars, electronics, weaponry, high end clothing and decorative items etc, that nations focused on manufacturing often build due to the cost as they pay less wages. This means there won‚Äôt be Chinese or Indian factories producing these goods, it‚Äôll be some warehouse in San Francisco or Manchester that only employs 40 specialist workers and a few people to help with ensuring quotas and production are as profitable as they can be

Again, you're assuming that all of those robots can produce everything needed for 10 billion people, at a price that matches what the poorest nations can afford.

It also assumes that those robots can switch to any design without any extra cost, manual input, or changes.

I mean, I completely get where you're going, but I don't think 30 years is a realistic timeline for a full robotic takeover.

Look at how long it takes to replace a fleet of cars, or the fleet of tractors &amp; machines used to manufacture things.

The plants that are produced in 2035 won't be shut down 10 years later just because automation comes along, there's a sunk cost, and building a brand new autonomous plant will be a monumental cost.

3576,"&gt; KAJA KALLAS, a former competition lawyer and member of the European Parliament, is just the sort of businesslike politician one expects in Estonia. She took over as leader of Estonia‚Äôs liberal Reform Party last year; polls show it in a dead heat with the ruling Centre Party. She has run a technocratic campaign, focusing on education and tax policy. But she loses her cool when she talks about EKRE, Estonia‚Äôs anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic populist party. ‚ÄúThey want to destroy everything,‚Äù she says: all the institutions that have made her open, tech-savvy nation more successful than ‚Äúother countries that had the same starting-point. Take Moldova, for example.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, take Moldova. Like Estonia, it declared independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. Both tiny countries have big Russian minorities, and both have struggled with emigration and shrinking populations. Yet in many ways they are polar opposites. Estonia joined the European Union in 2004 and the euro zone in 2011; Moldova‚Äôs EU candidacy has ground to a halt. Transparency International deems Estonia squeaky-clean, the 18th-least-corrupt country in the world. Moldova is 117th. Estonia is an IT hub, Moldova a farm economy whose pride is its excellent wines. Adjusted for purchasing power, Estonians are five times richer than Moldovans.
&gt; 
&gt; This week both countries held elections. Estonia‚Äôs polls close on March 3rd, but internet voting started ten days earlier. Moldova‚Äôs vote took place on February 24th. The results gave some hope for progress in Moldova. An alliance of reformist parties called ACUM, headed by two corruption-fighters, Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase, took 27 of parliament‚Äôs 101 seats. But the Socialist Party (PSRM), aligned with the Russia-friendly president, Igor Dodon, got 34. In second place with 30 seats is the ruling Democratic Party (PDM), a nominally pro-European group headed by the country‚Äôs biggest oligarch, Vladimir Plahotniuc.
&gt; 
&gt; Since ACUM has vowed to stay in opposition, a coalition seems to require the PSRM and PDM. But Mr Plahotniuc may have other plans. In Moldova, MPs often switch parties, lured by rewards or threats. Then there is the party of Ilan Shor, a 31-year-old Israeli-born businessman who, as an MP, now enjoys immunity from prosecution.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2015 Mr Shor was elected mayor of Orhei, a modest town an hour‚Äôs drive north of Chisinau, the capital. He has donated money to restore parks, repave streets and build social-housing units. Last year he opened a free amusement park called Orheiland. The town is dotted with Mr Shor‚Äôs ‚Äúsocial stores‚Äù, offering wares at subsidised prices. Three dozen new buses ply the streets.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is where the money comes from. In 2017 a court convicted Mr Shor of playing a role in a scheme that used fake loans to Russian companies to siphon nearly $1bn from the country‚Äôs banking system in 2014. Mr Shor has appealed. He blames another oligarch, an ex-prime minister serving nine years in prison.
&gt; 
&gt; Ms Sandu, a former education minister revered for battling corruption in the exam system, thinks the entire political class is rotten. Though nominally rivals, ‚Äú[President] Dodon and the Democratic Party are working together‚Äù, she says, blackmailing European countries into maintaining aid by threatening to turn towards Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; The EU nevertheless cut off most aid last summer, after Mr Nastase won Chisinau‚Äôs mayoral election only to see it annulled on flimsy grounds. Political rot and poverty have driven many to emigrate. Over a million of Moldova‚Äôs 4.3m citizens live abroad, and remittances are about a fifth of GDP.
&gt; 
&gt; If Estonia‚Äôs politics seem boring by comparison, Mart Helme, the leader of EKRE, is trying to fix that. On February 24th, the national holiday, EKRE led a torchlit march of 6,000 followers through Tallinn, the capital, chanting Eesti eest (‚ÄúFor Estonia!‚Äù). Mr Helme compares ‚Äúso-called liberal democracy‚Äù to communism, and the EU to the Soviet Union. His party wants schools serving the country‚Äôs Russian-speaking minority to switch to Estonian, and to restrict the numbers of Ukrainians coming in for low-skilled jobs. It is polling at 17%.
&gt; 
&gt; The Centre Party of Juri Ratas, the prime minister, gets most of the Russian vote. It is used to EKRE exploiting ethnic tension. But the fearmongering has less traction in this election, thinks Raimond Kaljulaid, a Centre Party MP. Young Russians are better integrated, and Estonian culture is doing well, with successful hip-hop artists and novelists. After a huge decline from 1991 to 2014, the population has risen for the past three years. Last year more Estonian citizens returned to the country than left.
&gt; 
&gt; How has Estonia avoided Moldovan-style corruption? Some believe it made better choices early on, privatising state enterprises in a more transparent fashion. Tarmo Juristo of Praxis, a think-tank, credits Scandinavian banks with establishing norms in the financial industry. But others think it may have got lucky. Lucan Way and Adam Casey, of the University of Toronto, argue that former Soviet states democratised better when they had a deep-rooted nationalist movement. This was stronger in Estonia, which was independent from 1918 to 1940, than in Moldova, which was ruled by Romania or Russia for centuries.

3656,"I think people take issue with the fact that he escalated things, de-escalated them after needlessly escalating them, then after his first meeting where he legitimized a murderous world leader and got nothing in terms of an actual agreement, he jumped on Air Force One and tweeted about how the world could rest easy because he'd fixed the problem.

I think everyone is in favor of Trump trying to work on the a North Korea issue, and even as someone who is very much not a fan of his, I'd gladly give him due credit for fixing it.

But here's my issues: by visiting and publicly meeting Kim Jong Un in an unprecedented way, he's giving legitimacy to someone who deserves none.

The bigger problem, and this is something he does in everything his admission works on, is that they don't do the usual planning required. There's a reason the Iran deal took years to hammer out. Because this shit is complex, and Iran wasn't even as far along as North Korea. The ground work needs to be laid out before the leaders meet, so that like this most recent trip, you don't have the president of the United States giving legitimacy to someone while themselves getting nothing in return. Part of this is due to the Trump State Department being gutted when he took office and never properly staffed. They are the ones who handle the details of these complex arrangements 

Another issue is Trump's constant penchant for praising dictators. He had the family of the US citizen who became sick in NK captivity and died when he arrived home with him at the State of the Union, but then after meeting with Kim Jong Un goes and internationally says that he believes him when he says the highly unlikely story that his tightly controlled government didn't let him know that they were capturing and improperly caring for an American. It's similar to what he did when he went out at Helsinki and said he believes Putin over the entire US intelligence community with regards to the Russian's meddling in the elections.

I think the most important though, is that when Trump lies about these things, he takes away the world's need to take him seriously. A podcast I listen to pointed out how it's hard to ask China to do the hard task of cracking down on the border and sanctions with Korea, when Trump is going around tweeting that he's fixed things there.

To sum it up, it's not that I want Trump to fail at something this monumental and important. It's that I don't think he takes it seriously.

3672,"They have succeeded in fabricating history in Azerbaijan. Two famous Azeri historians: Ziya Bunyadov and Farida Mammadova erased all traces of Armenia from their works.

&gt; According to Russian historian V. Shnirelman, Bunyadov ""purposefully tried ""to clear"" the territories of modern Azerbaijan from the presence of Armenian history"". ""Another way is to underestimate the presence of Armenians in ancient and medieval Transcaucasia and to belittle their role by reprinting antique and medieval sources with denominations and replacements of the ""Armenian state"" term to ""the Albanian state"" or with other distortions of original texts. In the 1960s to 1990s there were many such reprintings of primary sources in Baku, where academician Z.M. Bunyadov was actively engaged"".[6]

&gt; Soviet academic Igor Diakonov wrote that Bunyadov become infamous for a scientific edition of ""a historical source from where all mentions on Armenians have been carefully eliminated"".[7]

&gt; Historians Willem Floor and Hasan Javadi charged Bunyatov for making ""an incomplete and defective Russian translation of Bakikhanov's text. Not only has he not translated any of the poems in the text, but he does not even mention that he has not done so, while he does not translate certain other prose parts of the text without indicating this and why. This is in particular disturbing because he suppresses, for example, the mention of territory inhabited by Armenians, thus not only falsifying history, but also not respecting Bakikhanov's dictum that a historian should write without prejudice, whether religious, ethnic, political or otherwise"".[8]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziya_Bunyadov#Critics

&gt; According to Thomas de Waal, Mammadova's theories on the Albanians were formulated in such a way as ""to separate the Armenians completely from the Caucasus."" ""She has placed Caucasian Albania on the territory of modern Republic of Armenia: all the territories, churches and monasteries in Republic of Armenia have been designated as Albanian."" He describes Mammadova's theories as ""an improved version of what became a very rough tool in Azerbaijan"".[5]

3677,"No, I'm sorry, but it is pretty weird. This whole ‚Äú second most widely spoken language in the world‚Äù doesn't really cut it. Because most of the speakers are concentrated in one region and there aren't any countries where Spanish is spoken natively that are attractive to immigrants. Why would Lithuanians learn Spanish? The Norwegians could do it to retire later in life to Spain. Or the Romanians to emigrate to Spain. But the Lithuanians? What do they care that Spanish has 400+ mil speakers if most of those speakers are on the other side of the world? The whole widely spoken language falls apart very quickly and it's just not nearly enough of an explanation for what this post is showing. It's just some lazy argument.

So, I'd say that its popularity on Duolingo must be explained by something else other than actual real life popularity.

If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.""

3735,"Brussels has suffered a humiliating defeat in its plans to place Saudi Arabia and four US territories on a money laundering blacklist after virtually unanimous opposition from EU member states. EU diplomats said 27 of 28 countries, led by the UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, blocked publication of the list, which has also prompted fury in Washington and Riyadh. The strength of opposition means the European Commission will have to rethink its draft list of 23 non-EU territories deemed to be failing in fighting money laundering. According to a draft statement seen by the Financial Times, governments ‚Äî which had until Thursday to object to the commission‚Äôs list ‚Äî will say it was not drawn up in a¬†‚Äútransparent and credible process‚Äù.¬† ‚ÄúWe jointly call for a listing that meets our high standards and thereby further strengthens anti-money laundering and the combat against terrorist financing,‚Äù says the statement. Europe's list, published this month, includes Saudi Arabia, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa and Puerto Rico. None is named¬†in an international blacklist prepared by the Financial Action Task Force, the global authority on money laundering.¬†European banks would have to carry out ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù checks on funds from the named territories by applying rigorous vetting procedures on customers.

The support of 27 governments means the threshold for a qualified majority to veto the list has been reached. Brussels argued that the list used tough criteria to protect Europe's banking system from illicit cash flows after a series of high-profile money laundering scandals. However, the veto means the commission will be forced to go back to the drawing board and work with governments to come up with a transparent methodology, said a commission official.But the Saudi government and the US administration have branded the EU‚Äôs exercise as politically motivated. Gordon Sondland, Washington‚Äôs ambassador to the EU, denounced the commission‚Äôs exercise as ‚Äúpurely‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâpolitical‚Äù and said he hoped enough EU member countries would push to have it scrapped. ‚ÄúI think the process and the way in which it was handled is despicable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don't think that it is in the European Union‚Äôs interest to pick yet another fight, not just with the US but with a lot of other friendly countries over this kind of an issue.‚Äù¬† Diplomats said the Saudi king raised his objections with EU leaders during an EU-Arab League summit in Sharm el-Sheikh this week, while Riyadh‚Äôs deputy foreign minister, Abdulrahman bin Ibrahim al-Rassi, also took up the issue with European ambassadors in Riyadh on Wednesday.

According to a note of the meeting seen by the FT, the Saudi minister warned that the blacklist would have ‚Äúsevere negative consequences‚Äù for the kingdom's trade and financial flows with Europe. Diplomats said governments‚Äô concerns also reflected frustration at the commission for carrying out a politically sensitive exercise that risks harming member states‚Äô bilateral relations with third countries. Commission officials have countered that the list has been repeatedly discussed with members. The commission is required to prepare the blacklist under the EU‚Äôs anti-money laundering laws agreed by the bloc.¬†The exercise has the backing of the European Parliament, which also needs to approve the list. A group of 29 MEPs cosigned a letter on Thursday urging the commission to stand firm.¬†‚ÄúMaking the final list subject to political lobbying from the member states, depending on their bilateral relations with the countries concerned, would seriously damage the credibility of the EU,‚Äù MEPs wrote to Federica Mogherini, Brussels‚Äô top diplomat, and Julian King and Vera Jourova, European commissioners. Governments will hold talks with the commission in Brussels on Friday.

3780,"&gt; They're just trying to water down the anti-gender violence campaign to retain the status quo

They're trying to ""water it down"" because it's a blatantly misandrist and unconstitutional law. 

They're protesting the Integrated Protection Measures against Gender Violence (acronym LIGV) on the grounds that it is [unconstitutional] (https://www.eljuridistaoposiciones.com/es-la-ley-de-violencia-de-genero-constitucional/#.VsMXLPnhDbh)

Why? Here is what the law does:

The law establishes a difference between domestic violence and ‚Äúgender violence‚Äù.  While the first is violence that happens in the domestic area, the second is violence done because of sexism. BUT, here lies the problem: ‚Äúgender violence‚Äù can only be done by men, and it‚Äôs considered the default type of violence for men. That is, if a woman attacks a man, it‚Äôs considered domestic violence, even if she did it because she hates men; but if a man attacks a woman, it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúgender violence‚Äù, no matter what reason may be behind the attack. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he did it for money, jealousy, infidelity, vengeance, mental problems, or even self-defense. To the LIGV, every act of violence from a man to a woman can only mean he is a sexist, and attacked her because she is a woman. And of course, **the punishment for gender violence is higher than for domestic violence.**

This, of course, creates a lie that feeds itself. The numbers for ‚Äúgender violence‚Äù will be very high, since every single thing a man has done to a woman through the year is considered to be done because of sexism.

Another thing the law does is to give huge power to women over men, while striping men of their rights:

For example, if a call is made to denounce domestic violence, the man is automatically put in jail as a preemptive measure for up to 3 days. There‚Äôs no need for any proof or process. Just any accusation from any woman is enough for this. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how many times she has done it, the man will be thrown in jail again and again. 

In a domestic violence call, by law, the default culprit is the man. So, even if he is the one calling, and he‚Äôs the one with violence marks, he will be the one thrown in prison. And a restriction order can be placed on him, so he can‚Äôt go back to his own home if the woman is still there.

A woman making in accusation has *plenty* of reasons to make a false accusation. She can ask the state for an economic help of 400 euro each month during 11 months after the accusation. No need for a conviction, just the accusation is needed, and they will give her the money even if the accusation proves to be false.

If a man receives a gender violence accusation, he will lose custody of his children, and if he‚Äôs in a divorce process, he will most probably lose everything, which is hugely beneficial to women seeking a divorce. 

Women also get other special benefits, as they are considered ‚Äúvictims‚Äù from the moment they make the accusation. Depending on the province, they have cheaper prices to rent a flat, or they are directly given one for free. In some places they have to pay nothing to join university if they have made an accusation.

Also, illegal inmigrant women who make a gender violence accusation are given the papers to become legal inmigrants.

Women also have all the expenses of the trial paid by the state. They have to pay nothing for accusing a man.

It should be obvious to see the potential for abuse of this setup. 

Don't take my word for it though. [The European council is on the record stating that it is against the constitution and the rights of men.](http://justiciadegenero.com/en/espana-la-igualdad-de-genero-las-leyes-de-violencia-y-su-cumplimiento-del-convenio-europeo-de-derechos-humanos-un-caso-de-discriminacion-positiva-de-los-hombres/)

The [Spanish government has *doubled down* on the bias by extending this law to *every* case of violence against women.](https://www.elconfidencial.com/ultima-hora-en-vivo/2016-10-25/congreso-aprueba-ampliar-la-violencia-de-genero-a-agresiones-fuera-de-pareja_1047890/) meaning that any kind of violence toward and women in any circumstance, no matter the context or motivation will be considered ""Gender violence"" and will result in the same consequence-free wave of free stuff as detailed above.

&gt;
&gt;a) compared to the vast majority of other major airports in the rest of world, had their treshold set too low, most likely on purpose.

It certainly varies, but the way one's approached at FRA is certainly not welcoming. I had to literally empty my entire bag at Tokyo (Narita) but was treated with extreme courtesy and without a single armed person in sight.

&gt;b) had a stupid intimidation process defined for people who triggered that stupidly low treshold.

I absolutely agree that is intimidating (to say the least) having heavily armed officers questioning you over seemingly innocent stuff. 

&gt;This is why I'm now avoiding Lufthansa/Frankfurt. They went on power intimidation trips twice on me just because.

3813,"&gt; isnt the current deal exactly a DCFTA

The current deal isn't a DCFTA, the current deal is EU Membership, which is Single Market and Customs Union membership. A DCFTA applies single market rules to certain industries, allowing for free trade and matching regulations, but, rather importantly, it does not include free movement of people. A DCFTA on all industries would make an Irish sea border practically meaningless and would keep trading policy the same, meaning a smoother transition.

I know the Japan and Canadian trade deals took a while, but the EU was negotiating with countries with different regulations and low levels of trade. If the UK was out of the EU now it would be the EU's biggest single trading partner and already follows all EU regulations, we could negotiate a FTA a lot quicker because we're starting from a very close position, but ideally we'd negotiate this while we have a DCFTA protecting trade.

&gt; With backstop there is a clear end of the line.

I think the EU does indeed view the backstop as ""the end"", so to speak, that's the problem. The EU will keep free trade, will keep access to London's banks and will keep control over the UK's trade policy, only now the UK has no input and is not allowed to leave. It's quite clear that a lot of people in the EU's pro-integration political class are deeply offended by Brexit and can't afford a successful UK. I don't think they'd let us out of the backstop, or at least not before our economy has been stripped to the bone with companies using the free trade and extra time to relocate out of the UK while keeping access to the market.

The backstop is, to me, the worst option, it's better to be in the EU as a member and vote than in the EU as essentially a colony, ending free movement isn't worth directly transferring sovereignty to the EU.

&gt; unreliably the british political system is

I don't think I'd agree with this, if we had a more European system and every government was a 2-3 party coalition we'd be in even more trouble.

The political stalemate is the Conservatives fault, they promised a referendum when they didn't think they'd win a majority and planned to negotiate it away in a coalition. Then in 2017 they had a huge poll lead so used that to put loads of extreme stuff in their manifesto and that backfired.

Labour under Corbyn aren't winning an election anytime soon though and the Conservatives won't make that mistake again, the next election could easily deliver a 30+ seat majority which should be more than enough to get a Brexit deal through.

Although I'm incredibly happy that there isn't a majority for signing control of the country over to the EU and hoping that one day they give it us back. The EU doesn't really need a deal and has been very difficult to negotiate with, I don't trust them at all to negotiate in good faith from the positive of extreme strength that they'd have in the backstop.

&gt; The most important thing for economics - which lets face it is the driving factor most of the time - is stable, predictable legislation, so there is not much incentive to hurt britain

Not much incentive to change the arrangement once the UK is in the backstop either

&gt; I dont see what more the EU couldve done without sacrificing its principles.

Negotiate the future relationship at the same time as the withdrawal, or at the very least just offer the UK *something* for everything it's giving over in the Withdrawal Agreement. The EU overplayed it's hand and expected the UK to just roll over, but we didn't and the EU was too proud to go adjust it's rules.

The EU would get a lot more out of the UK if it made deals rather than demands.

&gt; UK decided to kick out EU citizen

The UK wanted to make a citizens agreement immediately, the EU refused to discuss it before Article 50 was invoked and even now has not made a guarantee to British citizens despite the UK making a unilateral guarantee to all EU citizens.

&gt; I think the biggest problem is that the brexit crowd didnt have a deal

Certainly a big part of it, but the EU shares a fair bit of the blame for it's staged negotiating strategy

[This one](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/26/5/569) conducted in China concludes that initiation rates fall in response to higher prices.

3878,"&gt; ISIS was not a recognized state by anyone.
&gt;Those people simply had European citizenship. Hence their kids have it as well.

That is not a given, it depends on the legislation of the countries in question. For example, armed insurrection and trying to establish a fundamentalist state seems to be reasonable ground to conclude that the person in question is no longer a citizen of said country in any meaningful way, if it's not outright treason.

This is one of the exceptional cases where the ""unknown or no nationality"" clause of the Syrian law *could* be said to apply.

&gt;We have existing laws on citizenship, that's not questionable. Under these laws, the kids inherited the citizenship of their parents.

The actions of their parents could very well have led to the loss of citizen status by the time of their birth. Fewer countries consider having a grandparent with the right nationality enough to grant it to the child.

&gt;No, children get it through parents automatically. Only if you try to get naturalized in another country, you have to go from some kind of process and earn your new citizenship.

That was a comment on the morality aspect, not on the technicalities: we grant nationality to people that we consider part of our nation.

The airport is built in the Flemish region just at the Eastern border of the Brussels region (and a few km North of the Walloon region), the wind comes mainly from the West. So the airplanes have take-off towards the city. 

Our genius politicians tries to spread the noise of the airplanes by spreading them everywhere there are few to no people voting for them (which mainly means not speaking their language). Which can explain why some of the planes flee over the centre of Brussels.

Because you can't simply.

&gt;Go look at Khojaly, nearly everything burned or destroyed

You know that the whole of Karabakh went trough a huge war? Have you seen Stepanakert? It looked like some cities in Syria today. Difference between Stepanakert and Khojaly (and your examples,wheter those are mosques or graves) is that we reconstructed the first and left the other as it is. 

&gt;Fact of the matter is, I'm not here to be in some dick comparison thread where I show off how many things were destroyed in comparison to Armenians, or vice versa.

Because it is in no way comparable. It's easy to paint the whole conflict as ""equally bad"" people and be done with it but that would be too easy and not true.

But just to be sure, which of the following factors do you consider the one that made the Nazis evil?

1. They were Germans.
2.

Now your point about him being the only one talking is true. But its also because every other us president recognises that unless they would have secured denuclearistion then in a foreign policy point of view  kim jong un 'wins' these summits. 

By talking to the us president the regime is further legitimated at very little cost to any of its strategic leverages. The us by comparison loses face and gains nothing.

Him meeting with the nk leader is both admirable and a mistake.  There's a reason why others havent done it (both domestically and strategically). 

So though it feels like progress is happening one has to step back and ask themselves: in what circumstance is the regime really going to give up their nuclear weapons and by extension,  their hold on power over the country?

The birth rates are not dropping much (as was predicted) and the average age in subsahar Africa is like 16. If you think there is already too much people there, this is only the beginning and the population will be growing even more massively until at least 2100.

Ok, let me put it this way.

1- This map does not clearly state if it is a geographical map or a political map. Does it?

2- The fact that Ankara is shown in it rules out the possibility of it being a geographical map.

3- So, according to this map, Ankara is in Europe. It says Europe in the title, and as you see, Ankara is in there as the user schoettchen points out, ""Regardless of geography it's marked on the map with one attack"". End of story.

4- Now, the rest of the thing is your own opinion. Because there is nothing that states that it's a geographical infographic or whatsoever.

5- Irish redditor said that ""Ankara isn't in Europe"". That's not correct, or partially correct. Ankara is in Europe in many senses, but also not in Europe in many other senses, exactly like the UK. That's why he is being downvoted.

4038,"&gt;Yes. Being Craven and blind to injustice, due to fear for one's own life is not laudable.

The Catholic Church spoke out many times on Nazism being wrong. The Church was the last political group standing, before Nazis took full control. 
And Catholics resisted the movement the entire time. 

&gt;They weren't. The Allies are, with their Resistance or, the Soviet Union and their resistance.

Resistance within Germany. And the Soviet Union only survived because Americans were supplying 50% of their food, steel, and other materials. 

&gt;The Catholic Church? They stood by with Fascist Italy and Spain. They helped and they hindered, but they did not resist as they could have. 

You understand you get killed/disappear for resisting, don't you? They did resist a ton!



&gt;You're also telling someone something that they know is a lie. Do you really want to go into a discussion about what Nazi rhetoric alluded to?

You are very dishonest. 

&gt;Priests did write of knowing what happened. 

And knew it was wrong, and resisted. 

&gt;The existence of concentration camps were known, as were the deaths, even if the means were hidden. The Germans cooperated for their war-machine, and most realize now that there is a responsibility.

Not true. Many did not believe of mass murders. Of course work-camps existed. But they did not widely know of mass murder. Or if they did, it was too late. Remember, Nazis seized full control of government in 1933. 


&gt;I would also counsel, knowing the Catholic Church, that transgressions can be forgiven, but not the denial of them.

Their strategy was to shut Hitler down by letting him fail as chancellor. As von Papen put it: *""In two months we'll have pushed Hitler so far into the corner that he'll squeak.""*

4134,"&gt; Yes, these are big countries. And there's no reason to lump us in with China or India in the context of this thread because we aren't them. They're huge developing countries that do what they need to do to feed their population. That's unrelated to trade with the US and UK.

The argument that the redditor made was that you were given free range for selling your garbage meat in the UK. You responded to that redditor that the EU was worst. I showed you that with your own source that you were literaly the worst and on par with China and India. It hurts you to be compared to them i think a bit of introspection is needed.

&gt; Those are the biggest outliers, but there are other countries higher than the US too, like Germany. And you have countries that are on par with the US, like Belgium.

So out of the four, there is Italy which is ""ok"" since i gave you the reason, Spain i totally said it was bad but compared to the US it's like a drop in the ocean. Belgium and Germany are using a lot of antibiotics because of health regulations regarding pig meat. Since the argument is your garbage meat it should compared to ours. And by comparing you see that we don't use much antibiotics compared to you. Thus the conclusion of the article : America one the biggest consumer way ahead of the EU.

&gt; A bad outcome is a bad outcome regardless of intent. If we're using an amount of antibiotics in our livestock that is the same or lower than the amount another country is using and also getting more value from the meat from our livestock, guess what that means? That means we're just doing it better.

No that means your society is retarded and making a collective suicide for short term satisfaction of your consumerism. The more you use antibiotics the more resistant the germs becomes. Since you use antibotics as a tool to make bigger chicken you accelerate the process of creating a strong immune germ that will decimate the animals and humans. Today those germs are a reality, they exist in hospitals and cannot be fought by medecine if you get them you are done for (though most are not deadly yet). The EU understood the gravity and banned this use of antibiotics thus preserving our continent in the long run. Using them to fight epidemic is just the way a medecine is meant to be used. It's not a bad outcome, we won against a disease.
Obama administration s understood it too and tried to reduce the use in the USA but to no avail.

And take for example Germany. Germans started colonization in the mid 19th century, but they did not become the strongest and probably most advanced country in Europe because of it. Colonies were for most countries investment, for which there was really not much of a return, with few exceptions (mainly UK, France, Netherlands and Belgium). There were very few profitable colonies, so the idea that our prosperity is because of that is nonsensical. 
And whatever Europe might have gained was more than destroyed after 2 world wars on our continent.

Wrong, they have to apply for settled status.
""And the EU is using the threat of economic collapse, food and medicine shortages as well as a resurgence in Irish terrorism as leverage for a deal, I don't think anyone smells of roses right now.""
wrong again, your politicians are WARNING for that scenario under a no deal Brexit. The EU had a deal with your country exactly to avoid this. The deal didn't pass through YOUR parliament.
""So you missed Tusk and Junker's little joke about a special place in hell?"" 
No I didn't but you should quote it completely, it was actually Tusk:  Unscripted comments from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, warning of a ‚Äúspecial place in hell‚Äù for those who pushed for Brexit ‚Äúwithout even a sketch of a plan‚Äù set off a furious reaction in London. 
He said this because without a deal the problems that you described might happen. British politicians that didn't have a plan now actually risk the health and safety of their citizens. So I can understand why he said that. 
""Under the agreement we could leave at any time as per Article 50, ""all treaties cease to apply"", the EU can't pick and choose which parts of EU membership it wants Britain to keep.""
in the words of your PM:
The Prime Minister said in a major speech in Florence in September that: I do not want our partners to fear that they will need to pay more or receive less over the remainder of the current budget plan as a result of our decision to leave. The UK will honour commitments we have made during the period of our membership.
""She's right, the EU doesn't have to make the UK an offer, but it wants Northern Ireland in the customs union and for the UK to keep funding the EU for a few years, yet they don't seem to understand they need to offer something in return for this. If the EU didn't want anything from the UK then this ""we don't want a deal"" charade would work, but they do, so it doesn't.""
Two points here: No customs union is part of the good friday agreement, that's why the EU wants it. The EU economy does not depend on NI.
The EU never said ""we don't want a deal"". Only British politicians ever considered that option. We can't force you to agree on May's deal or any other, your parliament has to do that. The phrase ""they need us more than we need them"" now pops up in my head. No deal Brexit would hurt the EU economically but will hurt the UK a lot more.

That's a hypothetical. You might as well suposed they get rid of the supposed ""requirement to join"" altogether, if you're engaging in acts of imagination. The reality right now is that whatever is written there is no benefit to expansion, and that's not going to change anytime soon because the Euro-crisis and Migrant Crisis underlined fairly clearly the ""trust principle"" in these agreement.  


\&gt;  I mean it in terms of internal governmental and public institutions.  Would it remain a constitutional monarchy or would it become a republic? 

The devolved government already has a core of internal government institutions require to operate the country as it has so far, and because of the historical disfunction of the UK, a seperate legal system and a seperate set of private currencies. Now there are institutions that would need to be implemented to EU standard, like border control and corruption monitoring, but those can be done with EU guidance rather than without.  


As for the second question, it's irrelevant.   


\&gt; Briefly, on the fallout of Brexit without a customs union, the whole UK  will have to make changes to their markets in order to mitigate the  effect.

4246,"&gt;The House of European History in Brussels plunges into the waves of youth protest, from the Second World War to the present day. On the street, but also in the bedroom. In Western and Eastern Europe. Because there were punks in Slovenia or Estonia. Climate activists Anuna and Kyra open the exhibition.  
&gt;  
&gt;Climate truants, beware: your protest fits in a long European tradition, which is presented in a colourful and interactive way at the House of European History in the Leopold Park in Brussels. ""Restless youth"" is the title, also the name of a report of the American intelligence service CIA from 1968. ""What makes Johnny riot"" the spies wondered. They did not immediately find an explanation.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Second World War was indeed a fault line. ""After that, young people no longer behaved obediently as those who went through history, but as active citizens who make history,"" says curator Christine Dupont. ""Youth as a barometer of society"" is the theme of the exhibition.  
&gt;  
&gt;**X-ray album**  
&gt;  
&gt;Four generations are presented. The first, shortly after the Second World War, was still seemingly quiet. The war was still fresh in the memory. A Danish wedding dress, made of parachute fabric, bears witness to this. But something was brewing, in international youth meetings or underground. American jazz found its way to the Soviet Union. Plates were pressed into recycled X-rays. Literally ""bone records"".  
&gt;  
&gt;**Longhaired men mapped**  
&gt;  
&gt;The revolutionary generation of the 60s is of course the best known, with student riots in several places, also behind the Iron Curtain. The exhibition also shows the wonderfully imaginative side of the sixties, with mini skirts and wearable pick-ups, with the Vjatka, the Soviet version of the Vespa, or the white bicycles of the Amsterdam provos.  
&gt;  
&gt;More unfortunate is the fact that the police of the former Czechoslovakia went so far as to literally map out ""long-haired anti-work scum"". The country was divided into zones and shaded according to the number of men with long hair. ""As if it was a species"", says Irina Chmel√≠kov√°, also curator of the expo and herself Czech. ""How absurd was that.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Punk from Ljubljana and Tallinn**  
&gt;  
&gt;In the 1980s, the gloomy motto was ""no future"", with sky-high unemployment. Punks and anarchists were also on the other side of the ideological border. Surprising to see a fearsome looking leather jacket from Estonia, full of nails, red stars and bullet shells.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the sexual revolution and free love, the sobering came with the AIDS epidemic; a catchy witness is a piece of quilt in honour of Dutch victims.  
&gt;  
&gt;The latest generation is the millennial generation, mobile thanks to European study exchange programmes such as Erasmus, entrepreneurial and ecological. But also to be found angry on the streets again, in the context of Occupy or Indignados. Against poverty, exclusion, racism. For women's rights. And of course for the climate.  
&gt;  
&gt;""What stands out in this history is that more and more girls and women are coming to the fore,"" says Christine Dupont. She is convinced that all these decades of protest - political and cultural - have had an effect. Youth protest has helped bring down dictatorships, has helped democratise education. But, Dupont warns: ""Nothing has ever been won.""  
&gt;  
&gt;She remembers how she herself argued against racism years ago, a scourge that has not yet disappeared. In that respect, it is not surprising that the most famous young climate activists of the moment, Anuna De Wever and Kyra Gantois, open the exhibition ""Restless Youth"".  
&gt;  
&gt;A few more artistic highlights: a beautiful and widely spread lithograph of Pablo Picasso with a peace dove, from just after the Second World War. A seductive illustration of David Hockney with homo-erotic poetry by the Greek poet Cavafy. And a delicious collage with coloured hearts, an ode to the love of filmmaker Pedro Almod√≥var.

&gt;My general impressions.

On reddit we call this this kind of source 'my ass'

&gt;After the West made them

It's always the west for you, isn't it.

&gt;Yes, and you realize the Bosnian Croats are getting more and more pissed at it?

Pissed of course, who isn't in this country. More and more? You are seeing things you want to see.
Also the question was about the relations of the two. Again federacija is miles more than anything croats and serbs have. Not even comparable.

&gt;they wouldn't take a 3rd entity in a heartbeat if offered

Yes to strengthen their position, who wouldn't. I never claimed it's all fine and dandy in the federacija. But I also belive that abolishing the whole entity system would be even more popular. But this is coming out of my ass this time.

&gt;the same Herzegovina tried to secede in the 90s too

Like I said this was considered unrealistically and therefore abolished. If you are not aware the fights lasted for something like 14 months or so. Also in other parts of bosnia during the same time they fought together.

&gt;nationalists that recently quite clearly aligned themselves with us

Source?

&gt;Serbs and Croats from my experience do see medieval Bosnia as their state, but not this modern mess which they see as a Bosniak state.

I'm not sure what serbs and croats you mean. If you are speaking about serbs from Serbia and croats from Croatia I think we both can agree that none give a shit about BiH.

If you are talking about croats and serbs from BiH than I can see why serbs don't see this as their country, but croats - see next point 

&gt;which they see as a Bosniak state.

Again you are projecting. Hercegovinians do really see this as their country. It says that right in the name: Bosna i Hercegovina. 

&gt; I'm not saying Serbs and Croats are becoming friends, but strategic allies against the Bosniaks

The difference is ultimately the serbs want to unite with Serbia. 
Hercegovinans don't want to seperate. So any alliances are bound to be non fundamental and for specific political gains.

4322,"&gt;Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, as the saying goes.

Whoever said that never had an enemy. Why do you want them to be headquartered here? Whatever they want to do here they'll have to conform to EU regs. Following your logic, legislation should be reformed to make it comfortable for these corporations to stay here, exactly from what the US political sphere is suffering from. And at any point they can just pack up and leave, becoming a Bahaman firm or whatever. So your point is, becoming a nest for megacorporations is advantageous because they will at least do some good before they move out and wreck everything in their wake?

&gt;  In practise megacorporations will just buy those small European companies and their superior product before it ever becomes serious competition. 

That's exactly how competition through innovation works. Small ones innovate, large ones buy the right to their product and set out to conquer the world with it. Then another one comes and it repeats until one of them does something so huge they refuse to be bought out. So how is it better if you don't allow small ones to appear? Large ones won't be forced to buy them up because the new ones' market opportunities would be nonexistent. Exaclty what happens in US telecoms. So all innovation we would get would come from the rare sparks that refuse to be bullied out of their markets. Which is like what? Once every 30 years per sector?

&gt; Even places like Cuba or North Korea are not free from it. We all know the flaws, but no one has come up with a viable improvement yet. 

Living with a moderate, regulated form doesn't mean we should all go Rambo and shake all yokes to see how extreme can it get. There's no logical connection between the two.

&gt; Our economy isn't seperate from the rest of the world, we can not just do our own thing here. 

But everybody else does that. Every country has its own flavour of global capitalism. Some of them employ a more mercantilistic approach, some onclude a degree of socialism in it, EU has a more consumeristic approach. Why do you assume ours is the wrong one? Why is your degree of success measured in the number of megacorporations produced? What exactly are megacorporations good for?

4325,"&gt;Do you not see the contradiction there ?

You‚Äôre obviously not an engineer. An assumption is not an estimate. It is very likely that you speak English, given that you‚Äôre someone a tourist is interacting with in a presumably touristy place in Europe. That‚Äôs just a probabilistic fact. Since I don‚Äôt speak French and never will, I‚Äôm going to speak the language I do speak which you‚Äôre most likely to speak. And if you don‚Äôt speak it, fine, I‚Äôll move on to someone else. 

&gt;No, I literally explained what we would rather have you do. Learn a couple of basic sentences in french to initiate conversation and you're good.

Again, this is a pointless exercise that no one else in Europe expects. They all actually have some amount of courtesy and decency. 

&gt;Maybe we ~~have more pride~~ are bigger assholes

That‚Äôs what everyone already knows. 

&gt;We do as please in our own country, 

Well, you could, if your economy weren‚Äôt so dependent on tourism. Really it‚Äôs the Americans and British who do as we please in our countries. That‚Äôs why almost none of us bother learning another language, because we have that privilege, since everyone speaks ours, including you lol

&gt;we don't have to change just because you are too lazy to make the smallest effort. To hell with your imperialist bullshit.

They are not in charge of allowing words or else. They make it official so that the gouvernment, schools and everything slighty related to the government &amp; public function have something to refer to when they need to look up something.

For example, in France, no one has a dictionnaire de l'acad√©mie fran√ßaise, we all have a Larousse, or petit Robert.. Same with Pons in germany, Oxford in the UK, etc..

They don't have a say in the language, they only recognize/make it official.

Mairesse has been used for ages, so is ""professeure, √©crivaine"", etc. It has been existing for decades. The only difference is, if you write it in your exam, they might count it as a mistake. Anywhere else is 100% okay. That's what the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise is for.

The likely outcome is that the EU will just get rid of all rebates for everyone, countries are of course trying to get something for them selves, but it's not really an issue that anyone is taking especially seriously.

I'm sure you know as well that the EU is still the largest importer of [UK services](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/bulletins/exportsandimportsstatisticsbycountryforuktradeinservices/januarytomarch2018). North America and Asia together are barely larger than the EU.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The UK is the only EU member whose trade with the rest of the world is about equal with the rest of the EU

Unfortunately I only have the numbers for the UK. That being said, considering how much Germany exports and imports from the US and China, I very much doubt the UK is the **only** one.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I am sure you know that the EU has several [trade agreements](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/negotiations-and-agreements/) with non-EU countries. So you can't really say that UK's non-EU trade is not dependent on the EU. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now you will say that the EU does not have an agreement with the US, China, Australia and New Zealand, so I'll preemptively give you those. That's about half of the non-EU trade. Do you have any better sources? Because I only know the 2016 numbers were that countries where there is an EU trade agreement in place accounted for a further 12% of  imports and 13% of exports.  So in total 57% of  exports and 66% of imports happen with countries the UK has some trade agreement with as part of the EU.

Yes. Politicians decide whether or not a bridge should be built with public money. As they should. Elected representatives of the demos. Engineers do what they're told.

How Brexit Britain Managed to Lose All of Its Friends
March 01, 2019

The sight of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, a self-professed ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù to Britain, berating Theresa May‚Äôs Brexit strategy this week was telling. Even at a time when France and Italy are at diplomatic loggerheads, Viktor Orban is painting the European Union as a menace to society, and Ireland‚Äôs Big Tech-friendly tax model is under fire from the European Commission, the bloc‚Äôs 27 member states have more or less stuck together in talks with the U.K. They‚Äôve certainly toed the negotiating line laid down by Brussels.

All of this matters as Theresa May considers requesting a possible delay to Brexit. Given that she would need the unanimous support of EU leaders, there will be strings attached.

May has used up a lot of goodwill over the past two years. She kicked off negotiations with unpleasant hardball tactics, misjudged Britain‚Äôs ability to extract trade terms with the EU that were just as good as being a member, and pressured other leaders to sign off on a draft deal in November that she herself has undermined since.

Her January promise to return to Brussels and renegotiate an Irish border provision that she‚Äôd only just agreed enraged many in the EU capital. Philippe Lamberts, an member of the European Parliament‚Äôs Brexit Steering Group, told me afterwards that the U.K.‚Äôs unreliable behavior demonstrated exactly why the Irish backstop was needed, and that European unity would hold. It has.

It‚Äôs pretty damning that the U.K. has failed to build any coalition within the EU that might help sway crucial votes or support its case. Core members like Germany and the Netherlands ‚Äì despite facing respective hits of 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) and 4 billion euros to yearly exports if Britain crashes out without a deal ‚Äì were quickly alienated by the U.K.‚Äôs logic-defying demands for preferential access to a market that it wanted to leave without stopping it from signing its own free-trade deals.

And while smaller pro-British countries such as Poland and Hungary have been among the country‚Äôs most outspoken supporters, they‚Äôve consistently defended the indivisibility of the single market and their own citizens‚Äô rights. As net beneficiaries of EU funds, they have good reason to stick to the Brussels script.

The central and eastern states that might have found common ground with Britain as a tough ally against Russia and a check on the dominant euro-zone countries like France and Germany have failed to rally to its cause on Brexit. Faith in the broader NATO umbrella has probably outweighed fears that Britain will drift away from military cooperation into isolationism. Most are driven by fears of being left behind by closer EU integration rather than inspired by Britain‚Äôs break for freedom. Poland‚Äôs criticism of the Irish backstop found little endorsement in the region, according to European policy academic Monika Brusenbauch Meislova, highlighting May‚Äôs forlorn task in trying to find cracks in the EU‚Äôs united front.

What happens next? As the debate moves from the terms of Brexit to whether Europe will allow May a few months delay, European unity is likely to hold, according to Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European Studies at Oxford university. If there‚Äôs evidence that this will help get May‚Äôs withdrawal deal over the line, much will depend on Germany, where lawmakers have expressed support for an extension of a few months. But if May takes negotiations to another ‚Äúno deal‚Äù cliff edge after that, her isolation may prove fatal to her own political career.

4687,"I feel like American comedy will get straight to the point, where as British comedians will be more reserved and maybe censor themselves a bit more. 

You can see the difference between them with Bill Burr or Louis CK and people like Eddie Izzard, Wich is the most direct British comedian I know and he's still very subtle.


And then there's the other types of European comedy. Now I speak French and Italian fluently so I can only comment on those, I'm not a very big fan of French comedy in all honesty, I think it's very bland, and hate all you want but I don't think French is a good language for comedy, it's really hard to get a good joke across.

Finally Italian comedy, that one's my favourite, usually Italian stand up comics aren't only stand up comics but also very theatrical in how they perform, like we had Beppe Grillo That would often get off the stage and come right in People's faces to touch them or yell at them. And we have Brigniano who's great at building up a very imersive scene out of nothing but words... Italian is also a very easy language to joke around with because thanks to the languages history of dialects there's plenty of ways of saying the same things.

As it stands, if migrant from subsahara arrives to Germany he isnt going to be deported. It simply wont happen, unless he is one of the unluckiest sods alive, as vast majority of German deportations go to Georgia, Ukraine and Balkans. Hell, invent a sob story and you are in for a humanitarian protection status where burden of proof is shifted onto state to prove that some virtual persecution did not happen. To be fair, this is not only German problem, this is virtually entire WE situation as it is.

So WE does have lax internal system, that it needs to keep that way because otherwise its not ""humanitarian"", but that creates problem because then its open season - get through border and ""prosper"" (or at very last that is dream smugglers are selling to millions). Which in turns gives birth to backslash like AfD or LEGA or take your pick, and then EU states decide to deal with that by magnitute harsher external policy when it comes to migration. Having a deal with Morocco. With Egypt. Shipping billions to Erdogan. Making deals with militias on western coast of Libya (they dont really have religious affilition they would care a bit about to be fair). Everything goes.

Now, of course, these whole cascade could be solved by actually making things right where they began - at internal situation, but nooooo...that wouldnt look good at local telly report. Having actual asylum system that respects spirit of post-Geneva consensus, that actually doesnt encourage illegal crossing of border or asylum shopping through two continents.

Because while your local telly wont be sending someone to Libya, and even if they did they will never get to hundred yards of one of those detention camps or actuall hell that is happening in Fezzan region that even AI heard only stories about, getting news from home is easy.

The problem is that people use stripping citizenship as a form of criminal punishment because it strangely can be done without due process simply by decree.

If they did something wrong then try them, find them guilty, and lock them up but this using of stripping of citizenship as backdoor criminal punishment flies in the face of all forms of due process and equal justice.

Citizenship should be strippable only based on either the holder of it asking for it to be removed or as a matter of procedure for voluntarily and successfully acquiring foreign citizenship and then all foreign citizenships should be treated the same.

Even _if_ you only strip it for treason or other crimes after due process it's still a violation of equal justice because citizenship can only be stripped in the casees of dual citizenship so you don't impose equal justice.

That's not true. If we were talking about simple math or alike then the proof would stand by itself. But when we are talking about more complex things, like space operations markets in US and EU, for a layman a presented proof is not enough in itself because a layman does not have the capacity to evaluate the said proof. For example a statement: no three distinct positive integers *a*, *b*, and *c* can satisfy the equation ‚Äúa\^n + b\^n = c\^n‚Äù. Now this is a supposed proof. Can you evaluate in your capacity whether this [proof](https://www.math.wisc.edu/~boston/869.pdf) is true or not? I think anyone who does not hold a degree in mathematics are not able to do so. For a layman whether something is true or not depends on expert opinion, with the beforehand posted proof, it is not per say true to your or me because of the contents of the proof as we do not have the capacity to evaluate them, it is true because an authoritative source says it is true.    
 

Coming back to your ‚Äúproof‚Äù even if it is true, I am not able to credibly evaluate it as I have little to no knowledge about what operations launching things into space entail and how they are priced. I do however consider Reuters news agency citing EU officials to be an authoritative source, or certainly more authoritative than random people‚Äôs comments on the internet. Therefore if you are saying that the article is wrong, US does not pay around twice as much as EU does for similar services, please, by all means write to Reuters presenting your proof, they will be able to evaluate it and will certainly correct their article if you are right. Then you have verification that your proof is true. Until then I think it is only reasonable to assume that Reuters is a more credible source than random people on the internet.

Why do you even need one though?

Like people often ask what the Netherlands would replace its monarch with when put under the proverbial guillotine and I'm like ""with nothing?""

The way I see it the Netherlands would happily keep on going business as usual when you just remove the monarch and put nothing in its stead and just send a minister of foreign affairs or some other diplomat for some of those ceremonial state visists. Switzerland has neither a monarch nor a president and does fine.

&gt; Sure, I gave an example of a king ""misusing"" his power, but it was easily solved and as /u/ratherimpractical
points out, presidents aren't above being flawed.

Well I don't believe in presidential systems and presidents either.

It is a core principle of UK Parliamentary sovereignty that no Parliament can be bound by a previous Parliament.

So in the UK referendums are always advisory; legally speaking the government is free to implement them or ignore them as it chooses.

The closest there has been to a legally binding referendum was the 2011 referendum on changing the voting system from FPTP to AV. Legislation was passed prior to that vote which said ""if the referendum passes then this clause comes into effect"".

If that referendum had passed then there would have been an immediate consequence in law so you could say that as ""binding"" rather than ""advisory"".

They want independence, they start an armed uprising (even though they had quite a lot of rights, such as schools and universities in Albanian, devolved parliament)... Serbian military and police forces start to quell the uprising. Since the Serbia was ruled by a dictator, this was seen as a chance by western powers to destabilize his power. USA demands peace talks, a reasonable agreement is reached to give even more autonomy to Kosovo, Albanians decline this agreement and come up with a proposal that was so out of the reasonable that Serb side refuses it. USA starts bombing Serbia for 90 days. Agreement is reached that Serbian military and police will be pulled away from Kosovo while international peacekeeping force will be stationed. By the reached agreement Kosovo is still part of Serbia, and small Serbian force should return after a few years. This was in 1999. 11 years later in 2008 Kosovo unilaterally declares independence (with no referendum), and USA recognizes it immediately as a lawful state in its own right.

5534,"&gt;Maybe I phrased it wrong - there is no widespread weed culture. The Netherlands were a outlier. It didn‚Äôt spread to Germany, France, and all the others.

  
The Netherlands pretty much championed the methods of cultivation that's commonplace all over the industry today.

  
France, Spain even Switzerland, are all European countries who've always had quite a lively domestic weed culture for decades. It wasn't/isn't legalized, but these were always countries where cannabis had way better of a reputation, particularly for recreational use, especially compared to countries like Germany and Austria which often have a straight up social stigma around cannabis.   


Germany in particular used to be straight up paranoid about it, suppressing most public pro-sentiments until the Red-Green government in 1998 finally made it acceptable to at least debate about medical legalization in the mainstream. In the mid 90s I was charged for ""possession"" just for having a dirty smoking pipe on me, fun times!  


To this day even plenty of people in the German medical community consider Cannabis some kind of ""reefer madness"" drug, and would rather keep subscribing opiates to chronic pain patients instead of recognizing the potential medical benefits of cannabis.  


&gt;So instead of accepting it - the left and and right wing parties in Europe continued with the prohibition of it. While in the US the liberal wing of the Democrats took up the torch and it spread all over the states. 

  
It's always been [conservative parties and interests](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-delays-roll-out-of-medical-marijuana/a-46872556) who've been pushing to keep the status quo.

The big difference here being that US conservatives have a bigger crosscut with the US variant of libertarians, and as such can both run on the ""no government involvement"" platform, which does not exist in a comparable form in Europe.

Also Germany doesn't take 50% of your salary for your medical insurance.  It usually is around 14-15% with about half this paid for by your employer. 
 
I too paid cash since I had to go to the doctor a few times before I was back in the Krankenversicherung and every doctors office thought it was a big hazzle to be honest. One told me they would not bill me until I got my insurance since they did not want deal with depositing cash etc. So nothing against your experience but I dont know why a doctor would care about being paid cash or billing out to insurance.

In Slavic Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day.

\- Huge wealth of resources (oil most of all) 

\- Culture of receiving immigrants - which means they have had a steady increase in population for centuries - which really helps economic growth

\- Huge metropolis (NYC and California) which help foster innovation

\- Their cultural strength - They are world leaders in most artistic industries - Music, Films, TV, Books, etc.. 

\- They are leaders in finance - NYC is the finance capital of the world. Which also makes them own the de-facto world-currency

\- In the past, it was their industrial prowess (much like china today) - Nowadays, it is their absolute lead in innovation in the tech sector, which is based in Sillicon Valley. No other country has a region as innovative as sillicon valley

\- Their investment in a huge military industrial complex - which helps them project power and influence all over the world 

\- Their culture of exuberant individuality and freedom of expression has created an enormous internal economy, while the EU and China are mostly export-based. The US economy is an engine for the world economy and the consumption of the world's goods.

The problem with it is that it is complicated issue. One one hand it is very expensive project that needs full commitment because just one reactor will be too expensive so you need to build a couple if not more on the other hand there is security issues when it comes to sharing those reactors with neighbours (this was initial plan), the third wheel in this is that reactor will allow poland to get nuclear capabilities but it is tricky business because it is hot mess when it comes to geopolitics and if you decide on doing that this comes with huge risks though with Russia invading Ukraine there is strong sense it should be doable in right wing circles because there is no longer ""why do you need it"" talk like it used just 10 years ago.

What I found interesting is that orthodox majority countries were more accepting of muslims as neighbours than catholic majority countries, while this was the other way around for jews (catholic countries more accepting than orthodox majority countries.

Anyway, compared to muslims and to Roma, the jews come off pretty lightly. Reading the report it seems to be more a matter of xenophobia than of antisemitism. If I designed this survey, I would include polls about neighbouring ethnicities to compare against jews. For example a romanian person would be polled if he would accept a ukrainean neighbour, a moldavian neighbour and so on and then ask for jews/muslims/roma. Since neighbouring ethnicities are problematic in the balkans, it would be wise to include as many as possible, as a bosniak might prefer anything over a serb, because of the recent wars.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/au77t0/antisemitism_rate_in_eastern_europe/ehgroyx/,reaqtion,1551348913

A second referendum would also mean that Brexit is postponed, cause the government needs time to set it up.

Net commuter inflows in these regions push up production to a level that could not be achieved by the resident active population on its own. There is a corresponding effect in regions with commuter outflows.",,/r/europe/comments/avnuj4/in_2017_regional_gdp_per_capita_expressed_in/ehgil7n/,B0etius02,1551335543

5998,"&gt; Europeans fund terrorism against Jews

Please, save the faux indignity for someone who doesn't know your nation was founded on [Jewish terrorism towards Europeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing) and [Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair).

&gt;but laugh away antisemitism concerns.

Because most of the concerns are indeed, risible: Everyone talks nasty online; Graffiti is usually unkind. This doesn't mean that there is a sudden uprising of anti-Semitism.

&gt;Europe deems all antisemitism as ""legitimate criticism of Israel "" such as when a German court ruled that starting a synagogue on fire was mere antizionism.

Context is key, which you are leaving out for political ends.

&gt;Then the first time one calls out European bigotry, ""Oh, that's anti European bigotry! We're not racist for supporting a terror group that calls for exterminating all Jews! We're victims here!""

Hamas doesn't want to exterminate all Jews anymore than all Israelis want to exterminate all Palestinians and Shia (I'll [let you chew on that for a while](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-t-shirts-joke-about-killing-arabs/)).

&gt; where Europeans fund illegal Palestinian settlements in Area C while condemning Israel for legally building in Area C.

That's probably because the Palestinian settlements are a paltry sum of land compared to the amount of land [The Jewish colonialists have stolen](https://yp6uap4od3sncuze-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IsraelPalestine.gif).",,/r/europe/comments/avnfyn/londons_banning_of_hezbollah_is_product_of_brexit/ehgiovu/,JanjaRobert,1551335669
