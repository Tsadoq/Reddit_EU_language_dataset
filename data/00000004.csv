0,"&gt;how much water is used per litre of beer production

Literally 10 secs to google it:

&gt;On average, the water consumption per liter of beer ranges from five to six gallons. The 2009 survey showed that the SABMiller Brewery consumed 155 liters of water to produce 1 liter of beer.  
&gt;  
&gt;The liter of beer consumes up to 60 liters of water. High water consumption will have to be sharply limited by beer producers.",Pomerania (Poland),/r/europe/comments/oyaucq/germany_was_the_top_eu_producer_in_2020_with_75/h7s3t4b/,kuzyn123,1628149560

Patently false. [Risk of hospitalisation for adults never drops below 1% regardless of age even for people with no comorbidites](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator), even when accounting for people with previously undiagnosed comorbidities. Besides, hospitalisation itself isn't the only dangerous aspect of an infection: [long haul covid](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html) with as-of-yet not completely understood [long term effects](https://www.ukri.org/news/examining-long-term-impacts-of-debilitating-lung-damage-from-covid/) impacts even people that went through the initial infection as asymptomatic, not to mention long term [brain fog](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/even-mild-cases-can-cause-covid-19-fog) which also happens in mild cases. 

For someone like me, brain fog is the scariest of all symptoms since my work life would be heavily impacted, possibly to the point of me losing my job, even if the fog is temporary.

&gt; They hardly reduce anything, Israel health ministry says only 39% efficacy against Delta infection for superior Pfizer (for J&amp;J even way way lower), only 16% against infection for 60+ after 6 months.

Yes, immunity fades over time, your nobel prize in medicine is arriving by mail within a fortnight. In Israel's case, if only they didn't have a sizeable part of the population that refused to take the vaccine, they could have had herd immunity months ago and completely avoided this wave if coupled with good international travel screening. This is why getting shots to as many people in as little time is so important, and why people with your stance on vaccines hurt people that otherwise wouldn't be hurt.

EDIT: your figures for low immunity in Israeli vaccinations are also a result of bias in selection for the earliest vaccinations, which isn't accounted for in the statistics and explains the mismatch with pretty much every other country:

*Doctors note that figures may not only reflect time that has passed since vaccination, but also a bias according to which those who vaccinated early were often people with health conditions and who are more prone to infection, such as the elderly.*

*Some analysts have warned that the figures on vaccine effectiveness are prone to major inaccuracies because of a range of factors, including questions over whether there is accurate data on infection levels among the non-vaccinated, which is vital for such stats. And British data indicates the Israeli studies may be overstating the case.* [source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-severe-covid-cases-could-reach-400-by-mid-august-researchers-warn/)

&gt; Are you seriously asking about drawback of vaccinating healthy people for whom it's COVID just flu with vaccine with unknown long term effects made with technology never used in history and first time used outside trials in less than a year for mRNA and less than a 2 years for viral vector vaccines?

There is no known mechanic by which a piece of mRNA that leaves your system in less than two weeks can cause any long term effects which could lay dormant for long enough for us to not notice them by now in the three billion doses that were administered globally.

In fact, there is no known way for ANY vaccine to cause symptoms like this, provided you don't specifically engineer them to kill. I challenge you to find any previous vaccine that presented such side effects, either in trials, or after official use started. You won't find any because they don't exist, it's purely a figment of your imagination.

As far as traditional side effects go, they're caused by the immune systems initial reaction to the vaccine agent, they *all* appear in one or two weeks after vaccination while the immune system reacts to the agent. For mRNA vaccines in particular, aside from allergic reactions to the chemicals within the vaccine, all the side effects seem to be tied to the spike protein as they somewhat mimic regular covid secondary symptoms: myocarditis and blood clots are also [present with regular infections, in larger numbers](https://theconversation.com/even-if-youre-asymptomatic-covid-19-can-harm-your-heart-study-shows-heres-what-student-athletes-need-to-know-149243), with what also appears to be a [bias *towards* younger and athletic people](https://theconversation.com/even-if-youre-asymptomatic-covid-19-can-harm-your-heart-study-shows-heres-what-student-athletes-need-to-know-149243), rather than groups which are traditionally considered to be higher risk.

If you're worrying over these side effects, the best bet is to get the vaccine since it's chance of those side effects are magnitudes lower than a full blown covid infection. The rates of serious vaccine side effects in the EU are laughably low, much lower than even death rates for young and healthy people:

268,"New covid / green pass rules in Italy:

  Everyone needs a green pass for some things, the most common reason for tourists is to eat in a restaurant.  do i need the greenpass?

The rule is ""you cannot eat at the tables inside the restaurant without the green pass, but you can eat at the tables outside the restaurant.""

  Textually ""From Friday 6 August the green pass will be mandatory in Italy and it will be necessary to always have it with you to:
  - access to tables inside the restaurant;  except for hotels and only for their customers.
  - enter the cinema, theater or museums;
  - practice physical activity in the indoor gym;
  - participate in festivals, enter stadiums, congresses and major events;
  - consume at the indoor bar at the table with the exception of counter service, no limitations for outdoor tables;
  - move in and out of the territories classified as red or orange zones. 
Regions and autonomous provinces may provide for other uses of green passes within the territories of their competence "".

  everyone can refuse the vaccine and get the green pass (I'm only writing about the Italian rules to get the green pass in Italy, I don't know your countries).
  Textually: ""There are three conditions that allow you to get the green pass:
  - be healed from Covid 19,
  - have a (negative) swab in the previous 48 hours (the green pass is processed daily)
  - have undergone at least one dose of vaccine (validity begins 15 days later if you have taken 1 dose of vaccine or single dose J&amp;J / validity begins 2 days later for those who have taken 2 doses. VALID ONLY FOR THOSE WHO VACCINATE IN ITALY). ""

  Make sure your vaccine is accepted in Italy.
  REITHERA therapy or ""experimental vaccines"" are not allowed to recognize you as vaccinated.
  EU vaccines are usually recognized in Italy.

  The green pass doesn't last forever.
  - the green pass from the complete vaccine cycle is valid for 9 months
  - green pass from tampon is valid for 48 hours",,/r/europe/comments/ovnix1/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20210801/h7rlvpm/,KaiserSwiss93,1628136911

294,"The Benz Patent-Motorwagen (""patent motorcar""), built in 1885 by Carl Benz, is widely regarded as the world's first production automobile; that is, a self-propelled vehicle for carrying people.   
The original cost of the vehicle in 1885 was 600 imperial German marks, approximately 150 US dollars, equivalent to $4,321 in 2020.   
The vehicle was awarded the German patent number 37435, for which Karl Benz applied on 29 January 1886. Following official procedures, the date of the application became the patent date for the invention once the patent was granted, which occurred in November of that year.  
Benz's wife, Bertha, financed the development process.  
Benz unveiled his invention to the public on 3 July 1886, on the Ringstrasse in Mannheim, Germany. About 25 Patent-Motorwagen were built between 1886 and 1893.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/oya2uk/5_august_1888_bertha_benz_the_wife_and_business/h7rn74y/,filosoful,1628137682

464,"I'll take one for the team again...

First off, congratulations to all the athletes who won medals and to the UK for another performance way above what's to be expected from its size.

Now let's clarify two things. 1. The UK was traditionally on par with nations like France or Italy (often even worse) and completely turned things around in the last two decades through massive investments in preparation for the London Olympics 2012. Since then the UK has outperformed all other European nations thanks to the birth of this golden generation. Also explained in this [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-UK-so-successful-in-the-Olympics). Whoever thinks I'm making this up: Feel free to not only check out the UK's performance in the last 5 or so olympics (since 2000) but also Japan's as currently a similar thing is happening there thanks to the Tokyo Olympics 2020.

2. Why are some people ""salty""? (A word that seems to be used very liberally since the euro cup...) Imo the problem with this kind of post is the (not so) subtle message of British supremacy over Europe within the current political climate - after British redditors have been doing the same thing with the vaccine rollout (in which the rest of Europe actually basically caught up months ago), with the euro cup (in which England ultimately lost) and even with some economic growth data (which is guaranteed to be highest in countries that had the worst recession like the UK). It would be nice to get a break from the ""UK better than Europe"" narrative for a year or two tbh.

And this doesn't mean you can't celebrate achievements, but it's so obvious that that's not the point of these posts. If this was Germany, Italy or France, I can see a headline like ""number 4 in the world"" or something similar rather than a ""Germany leading Europe. X at a distant second.""

If I saw that type of post from a German reddit account dedicated to posting almost exclusively pro-German articles on r/europe (like OP), I'd be very suspicious of what type of account it is.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/oy0m8z/the_uk_currently_leading_europe_in_gold_medals/h7qqq23/,yamissimp,1628121309

662,"I can see the reasoning, but generally it is expected that the government will act, to a degree, in the interest of its subjects (citizens and permanent residents, and sometimes non-permanent residents). While democracy means majority rules (theoretically, anyways, though some democracies live up to that better than others, while some outright fail and verge on or fall into minority rule), there generally are, and should be, limits upon what a government can do to its subjects and where they live.

Consider how the US cannot merge or divide state's without permission from the applicable legislatures. There's a certain level of approval needed from the parties involved to move forward. I'm not sure if the same is true for ceding land, but I'd argue it should, at least for territories (or states) that are not simply taken in from the start with the intent on granting them independence after a certain point in time. Doubly so if the territory was unwilling.

Going back to your marriage metaphor, in addition to there being a measure of guardianship that the government owes (more akin to a parent and child), It's notable that most land acquisitions (and subsequent population incorporation) are not a marriage by rite (well, Catholic rite, anyways) or by law in most places. As you said, both parties agree to a marriage, whereas most annexations are one sided. Consider the conquests of Ireland and Puerto Rico. Neither much wanted their Anglo overlorslds, yet England conquered Ireland and later directly incorporated it's client statebinto Britain, while the US extracted Puerto Rico from Spain. To now say that they should be able to be cut loose because they aren't desired anymore is to shirk all responsibility. 

Now, Scotland, admittedly, is different from Puerto Rico and Northern Ireland and Puerto Rico, though so too is the metaphor. Scotland willingly joined with England, but the Acts of Union did not simply annex Scotland into England, but rather dissolved both and replaced them with on state: the Kingdom of Great Britain. In that case, Britain is the state for both nations, and it is a bit like a marriage. But, as I said, there is a level paternality that the state owes to its subjects. A parent cannot simply kick a minor dependent out on the streets. Now, just as Scotland should be able to leave if it so pleases, so too can England. So too can Wales. And so too can Northern Ireland. There is the odd reality that they can all move out together, but I'd argue that this would leave them at the mercy of negotiating solely with Scotland for what the UK can keep and what goes to England, Wales, and NI, which leaves them somewhat at the mercy of the Scottish UK.

I've rattled on quite a bit longer than I expected. Regardless, to sum it all up nicely and neatly: most of nations are not marriages of mutual consent, but creations of force or circumstance. A state is more akin to a parent and the citizens it's dependent children, to whom it owes a responsibility. To simply cut loose a territory against its wishes that you have otherwise made yours permanently or indefinitely is to simply shirk the responsibility owed to your subjects there.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/oxw9b7/only_11_of_people_in_britain_oppose_a_united/h7ptu6f/,ptWolv022,1628106726

So to take a rather gross example, there may be tons of ancient Greek amphitheaters still more or less standing today, but only one, or a couple, will earn UNESCO world heritage status, as representative of that general architecture.

Also, every country has some broad areas considered UNESCO world heritage. For example, the buildings along the banks of the river Seine in Central Paris is as a whole a UNESCO site, yet it includes many monuments which could be by themselves UNESCO sites if they were alone. Same goes for whole cities like Florence. I imagine many Greek UNESCO sites cover many different ancient monuments which alone could be UNESCO sites, but they're all grouped in one because they happen to form a broad complex of ancient buildings.

901,"&gt;  I assure you there are no progressives who ignore or are against freedom of speech while fighting against injustice. 

Hah, like I don't see it on reddit all the time. It's not just the elites. Normal people  love to take away  rights from others like freedom of speech,  protest or assembly, as long as they perceive those others as a different tribe. Just look at the glee with which redditors say ""Gotcha! There is no freedom of speech on social media so you can be censored!"" Or hating on principal protests from another political party, especially Americans do this. I must admit I'm guilty of this problem too as I wouldn't be too mad if communist parties got banned. So it is a normal people problem. There isn't enough tolerance for different political views.


&gt;The fight against authoritarianism is very important, but gay marriage, trans-positive laws, promoting tolerance and empathy, etc. etc. is helpful at the very least in making sure that as a society - there aren't that many people who vote into power bigots who will definitely infringe on your freedom of speech, while throwing their anti-gay laws for example in your face so that you feel good in your hate.

Things aren't always simple and straightforward. Censoring hate or criticsm -&gt; more acceptance. Although IMO that can sometimes backfire, still it's generally pretty straightforward. But what if censoring hate or criticism -&gt; dictatorship -&gt; less rights for minorities? Note that none of the censor heavy governments are good places for marginalised people.   


&gt;Social rights do not empower you against other people.  

They mostly do though. But with that I more aimed to contrast them with other classical rights. All the rights associated with 20th century democracy actually help safeguard that democracy. They empower people against the power of the state. But many of these new rights, though they do improve the lives of people, do not make them any more powerful against the government like free speech, right to due process, freedom of assembly, privacy, etc. do.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/oxmgg2/phd_student_in_switzerland_expelled_from_his/h7odl3z/,ZmeiOtPirin,1628084784

The reason I'm involved so much is I used to be a Christian myself, and 'fell out' of that belief system because I realized it's just as believable as any other religion.

I found the thing that really ignites something in me though. It's the natural world around us, or, as Richard Dawkins put it, 'The greatest show in earth'. 
By the way, that's also the title of a fantastic song by Nightwish. Highly recommended.

I think this show around us, that we are just a tiny part of, is much more fantastic and great than anything religion can offer me at this point. Which doesn't mean I think everyone should be like me.. please no :) religion can do great things for people personally. But it is also very divisive and can be malicious.

1001,"Do you think that borders are walls and fences with mine fields? In most places borders are just marked by poles and signs, and the fence is only next to the crossings.

The reason why people don't just cross in normal situations is because it's illegal and if the country you crossed into finds out, you have to return to your home country and probably pay a fine. 

In case of sending migrants and fuck knows who else in those crowds, you have to physically stop those people from crossing your border. And because of idiotic EU laws Lithuania cannot just round up those people and push them back to Belarus wherever Belarus doesn't have guards.

And Lithuania is too small of a country to deal with this alone, so they need our help, or they will have tremendous migrant crisis that can spawn political problems and unrest. And I bet EU doesn't want yet another Poland or Hungary in EU.

So the only right answer by EU is let Lithuania send the migrants back, and then completely seal the borders with military force. Every EU country could send couple thousands troops (apart from Italy and Greece, they need theirs because there is exact same problem at southern Europe, just at sea, so it's easier to deal with if your military and border control isn't tied by retarded regulations other powers can bend and use). 

Belarus would probably have an absurd spike in unrest, ≈Åukaszenka would have to use military not only to fight his own people, but also to protect himself, and then to watch the borders with Poland and Lithuania, where there would be couple thousands of troops and equipment just across.
Belarus doesn't have such military. So it would all fall apart. He wouldn't take help from Putin until last moment, because he always wanted to be a dictator, not a complete puppet of Putin. It's also a matter of honor for him.
And I'm honestly not sure if Putin would even want to get involved, if he would have to fight Belarusian people on the streets. I assume not, he would leave it be for now to boil on it's own. It's not like there is anything to save in Belarus, they have GDP of Warsaw...

Belarus also lacks the resources to manage a growing refugee camp or population so no doubt there will eventually be some manner of conflict between the Belarusians military and refugees but as the goal is to get them to leave it is unlikely the conflict would be sustained by the Belarusians who may respond by simply opening their border and forcing the refugees to cross pushing the burden onto Lithuania. 

The burden is going to fall on Lithuania either way - there really is no relevant focus for Europeans than to focus on Lithuania and assisting where necessary. If there is a conflict it will be between Lithuanian border police and the refugees and this is also not a good outcome.",,/r/europe/comments/oxkwfd/lithuania_hopes_to_avoid_armed_provocations_after/h7o0hzf/,Thom0,1628077606

1011,"&gt; The 60-year-old Romanian captain has been detained from his ship Red Garnet, reports the Free Seafarers' Union of the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF).

&gt; The reason why the Romanian was detained is said to be strictly related to the conflict between Greece and Turkey over the division of Cyprus. More specifically, the Romanian skipper is accused of operating his ship last year in the Cypriot port occupied by the Turkish side.

&gt; ""The ship's agent in the port of Vassiliko has given assurances that this will not happen and that these political-administrative measures will no longer be taken in Cyprus. However, we were astonished to learn that the master has been detained through no fault of his own,"" said the trade unionists, who are appealing in an open letter to both Prime Minister Florin C√Æ»õu and Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu to intervene as soon as possible so that the Romanian is released.

&gt; **Open letter:**

&gt; ""Prime Minister,

&gt; Minister of Foreign Affairs,

&gt; Minister of Transport

&gt; The Free Seafarers' Trade Union informs you that last night, 02 August 2021 in the Cypriot port of Vassiliko , the 60 year old master of Romanian nationality was detained from his ship Red Garnet.

&gt; The reason for the detention is that last year the ship he was in command of operated in the Cypriot port occupied by the Turkish side.  The ship's agent in the port of Vassiliko has given assurances that this will not happen and that such political-administrative measures are no longer taken in Cyprus. However, we were astonished to learn that, through no fault of his own, the master was detained.

&gt; Please be informed that under international law the crew, ship and cargo of merchant ships are guaranteed security as long as they do not violate the rules and principles of maritime commerce.

&gt; We consider this hostile act to be an abuse by the Cypriot authorities, a serious violation of human rights and freedoms and of European legislation, bilateral relations and agreements between Romania and Cyprus.   

&gt; The Free Seafarers' Trade Union, family and colleagues - we are all astonished by this unprecedented measure in the history of good relations between our countries.

&gt; We therefore ask you to intervene through all the channels of the offices and dignities of the state you hold so that the master is immediately released. He has done nothing but command his ship safely to its designated port of destination. Refusal to make the indicated voyage is tantamount to hijacking the ship and is punishable very severely under the law.

1107,"**Part 6: The conflict**  
After Gerber reads the e-mail in which his professor writes that there is ""no longer a supervisory relationship,"" he desperately turns to his father. He contacts a lawyer. On the advice of his girlfriend, Oliver Gerber compiles a dossier of e-mails between himself and his most important contacts at the HSG that same evening. His lawyer writes several letters to the university management in the coming weeks.  
Gerber's goal is to be able to continue studying at the HSG. But the university argues that the professor did not kick him out, but that he had long since been exmatriculated at his own request. In fact, Gerber is only enrolled at the Chinese university from the fall semester 2019, not at the HSG. The manager of the doctoral programs at the HSG had advised him to do so. He wrote by email, so the maximum duration for the degree could not expire while Gerber was in China. ""De-registration also gives you all the choices."" Re-matriculating, he said, is like applying again - but with his professor's support, it's not a problem.  
Gerber follows this advice and temporarily de-registers at St. Gallen. The program manager writes, ""A wise decision."" On the university's website, Gerber continues to be listed as a doctoral student for the time being. The professor supervises him as before - until she complains about his tweet. For example, she asks him to send an outline after a Skype meeting. On February 21, 2020, a few weeks before she declares the supervisory relationship nonexistent, she writes: ""It's great how well you've already progressed in China!""  
Although Gerber can document all this, in spring 2020 the university sticks to its position that he had long since ceased to be an HSG doctoral student when the rupture occurred because of his tweets. The university's ombudsman also does not want to deal with the case for this reason. The HSG informs Gerber that he would have to reapply completely if he wanted to continue studying. And that he would have to look for a new professor who would supervise him.  
The professor did not disclose which tweet the ""excited emails from China"" referred to and who they came from until she was asked by the NZZ. She had received a message from a Chinese doctoral student who was doing research at a Canadian university. The e-mail is available to the NZZ, but the name of the sender has been blacked out - according to the professor at the request of the author.  
The writer accuses Gerber of a ""racist attack on the Chinese people."" He is referring to a specific tweet: a cartoon that Gerber had posted in response to another user's tweet. It shows a cartoon character who has been altered and has stereotypical Chinese features: yellow skin tone, slit eyes. In the spring of 2020, that drawing circulated on social media and was deemed racist by some users. Gerber says he only shared the cartoon because of its political message. The subject is China's stance on Taiwan and Hong Kong. ""In retrospect, I realize that I didn't question the portrayal of the Chinese person enough.""  
The professor says she pointed out to Gerber that he was no longer allowed to pose as an HSG doctoral student on Twitter because he had exmatriculated the previous year. ""This has nothing whatsoever to do with the issues of China or censorship."" She said it was an oversight that she wrote in the plural of ""excited emails from China,"" although she had received only one email- and that was from Canada. She had wanted to make clear that further reactions were to be expected. The phrase ""then I would have to end the supervisory relationship"" had referred to the informal advice she had given ""at the request of the doctoral student"". The fact that Gerber had been listed as such on the HSG website until the end of March was simply due to an omission.  
The professor further explains that the relationship of trust had been strained because Gerber had ""lost his temper"" in a conversation a year earlier and had told her that he no longer wanted to continue his doctorate at the HSG in any form and no longer needed her as a doctoral supervisor. Gerber denies this. He had only once considered pursuing a double degree from both universities. In the emails between the two from 2019, which are available to the NZZ, there is no indication of tensions.  
Whether the professor received ""excited mails from China,"" as she herself wrote, cannot be assessed conclusively. However, China can also exert pressure with its visa issuance policy. The professor's first mail clearly shows that she feared she would no longer get a visa for China because of Gerber's tweets. This also explains how quickly she broke off contact - regardless of the fact that Gerber immediately deactivated his Twitter profile. Were there additional economic interests at play? The HSG says the professor's department never received funds or other support from Chinese companies or other Chinese actors.",Berlin (Germany),/r/europe/comments/oxmgg2/phd_student_in_switzerland_expelled_from_his/h7nr776/,YvonMatterhorn,1628070389

1111,"**Part 7 (final): The aftermath**  
How does the HSG assess the case today? Prorector Ulrich Schmid says: ""The HSG is unreservedly committed to the freedom of teaching and research. However, the freedom of research is in no way affected here, as it concerns private statements by the former doctoral student, which he published via a social network."" The tweets could not be commented on, he said. ""But the fact that they obviously caused great discussion and were perceived as racist justifies the professor's request to clearly distance herself from them.""  
Schmid emphasizes that Gerber's supervision after her de-registration was ""purely voluntary"" and had an ""informal character."" The professor was ""well within her rights"" to terminate this at any time if the relationship of trust was disturbed. Further, Gerber had not made a full request to re-enroll, but had attempted to force his re-enrollment.  
In early summer 2020, Gerber decided to abandon the legal effort. He says he did not complete the matriculation application because he could not find a new supervisor: ""There was no other professor in the same department with whom I could have finished my thesis. Changing the subject would have meant starting from scratch again after three and a half years. That was out of the question for me.""  
Gerber thought long and hard about whether to make the case public. He hopes to spark a debate about how China is influencing Swiss universities.  
Today, Gerber says that starting to tweet was a mistake. That he could lose three years of research because of it still leaves him stunned. Yes, he took a path critical of China and once shared a cartoon that he would not share today, he says. ""But I didn't do anything wrong.""  
Gerber has given up his doctorate. He says, ""I don't want to have to censor myself - certainly not in Switzerland.""

Because it implies that there not being term limits in Turkey is not a problem because there are no term limits in Germany either.

But that's a fallacy because at best, Germany may have laws that prevent rulers from abusively extending their rule forever or, at worst, Germany might just as well fall in the same trap Turkey has fallen in. Just because Germany hasn't been ruled by an oppressive ultra nationalist leader yet* doesn't mean a lack of term limits is a good thing.

Once again, the slavs there called themselves not Rus people but Russkie people. And the language they spoke, Old Russian, they called just the Ruski language.

The name Russia appeared during the time of formation of the Tsardom of Russia from the Grand Duchy of Moscow:

In Greece, like much of Southern Europe and also parts of Asia Minor, you have the so-called [Mediterranean climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate). In this biome, all the annual rainfall occurs around October-April. And very little rainfall the other half of the year.  By high summer, a lot of the wild grasses dry up, but the [pine forests](https://www.google.com/search?q=mediterranean+pine+forest&amp;oq=mediterranean+pine+forest&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5171j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) stay green.  The plants in this biome have evolved over millions of years to survive and stay green on the water they've collected during the winter months. However, even green-looking trees and shrubs are quite dry in the summer, and pretty flammable. These fires are a frequent occurrence, but climate change can make them more frequent.  Heatwaves can make the fires more likely to occur.

Greece has certain methods of managing/containing/responding. It's illegal in many areas to have outdoor fires between like April and October, or something like that. Airplanes and satellite images are used to monitor the forests to detect fires early. In some vulnerable areas, I've seen they've cut a strip forest, to divide the forest into sections, to contain forest fires if they occur. So, there's methods and legislation and all that, but there's calls that it may not be enough.",,/r/europe/comments/ox8851/picture_from_the_greek_wildfires_today/h7n2ydp/,skyduster88,1628051051

California has always had large forest fires due to the nature of the seasons there. The last few years of fires are nothing new, only in the size and scope of the relative area the fires have spread. Rain seasons start very late comparatively to elsewhere, and last typically from November to March (this is actually where the moniker ""The Golden State"" comes from: all of the fields of dead grass etc about the foothills of the Sierra Mountain range).

1667,"&gt;PARIS ‚Äî Good news for the Franco-British relationship: The two sides agree on something! The bad news: They agree their relationship is in a terrible state.  
&gt;  
&gt;One sign of how bad things are, and how hard they may be to repair: Conversations with French and British officials suggest they don‚Äôt even agree on what type of relationship they‚Äôre in, even as they try to play up the chances of an improvement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Brits like to speak of a love-hate relationship between siblings who are rivals but also great friends. The French sorrowfully say the two countries are spouses in the midst of an acrimonious divorce (Brexit) but hold out hope for a return to civility.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, relations between France and Britain have often been fraught over the centuries ‚Äî and there has been plenty of tension in recent decades, both when the U.K. was a member of the EU and when it wasn‚Äôt.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the strains of Brexit, the very different outlooks of the countries‚Äô leaders and recent spats over the coronavirus have all contributed to making the current cross-Channel relationship particularly sour.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult every day, there is bad faith every day,‚Äù one senior French official said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Peter Ricketts, a former U.K. ambassador to France, declared: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as bad as I can remember it.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Other officials on both sides of the Channel gave a similar assessment.  
&gt;  
&gt;But conversations with such officials also suggest that each side, despite having hordes of people devoted to understanding the other, labors under some fairly basic misapprehensions.  
&gt;  
&gt;British officials think their French counterparts spend much more time than they actually do thinking about the U.K., and trying to punish Britain for Brexit. And many French officials treat U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit as an unfortunate but short-lived episode to be reversed.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúBrexit is a phenomenon of political, cultural, social disengagement,‚Äù a high-level French government official said, noting that the two sides haven‚Äôt held a bilateral summit lately.  
&gt;  
&gt;A British civil servant said that the French have a tendency to be ‚Äúdismissive‚Äù of a phenomenon they would rather not think about, particularly as it ‚Äútouches a nerve‚Äù when it comes to France‚Äôs own anti-establishment movements.  
&gt;  
&gt;The latest bilateral blowup came after Britain suddenly imposed quarantine rules on travelers returning to the U.K. from France over apparent concern about the Beta variant of the coronavirus. The French government blasted that move as unjustified discrimination.  
&gt;  
&gt;Britain is preparing to drop those restrictions this week, according to officials. But the measure was just the latest of many moves in recent months viewed as provocations on the French side of the Channel.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since January, the British have threatened to unilaterally extend arrangements for exporting chilled meats to Northern Ireland (aka the ‚Äúsausage wars‚Äù), sent naval ships to Jersey in response to a fishing dispute ‚Äî and even accused French President Emmanuel Macron of having ‚Äúsmall dick energy.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The Brits see plenty of provocations from the French side.  
&gt;  
&gt;They were incensed by comments from Macron about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in the U.K. and a mainstay of Britain‚Äôs vaccination drive. Macron declared, without having data to back up his assertion, that the jab ‚Äúseemed quasi-ineffective on seniors.‚Äù Macron also made a clumsy intervention on Northern Ireland‚Äôs position in the U.K.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Brexit bites**  
&gt;  
&gt;At the heart of the rift lies Brexit. This is not just about the exit of the U.K. from the EU ‚Äî it also reflects a major faultline between the worldviews of Macron and Johnson, who won power with diametrically opposed positions toward the EU.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIf you take President Macron, one of his central pillars is the EU. The fact that the U.K. government is so openly confrontational and doesn‚Äôt want a structured relationship with the EU makes the Franco-British bilateral relationship more difficult,‚Äù said Georgina Wright, head of the Europe Program at French think tank Institut Montaigne.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe Brexit negotiations, because of the politics, have soured some of the constructive thinking about what the U.K. and France can do post-Brexit.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The depth of the faultline has made a return to a constructive relationship between the two countries after Brexit more elusive than many expected, including in both governments.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAs long as Boris Johnson is in charge, it will be hard for Brexit and the bilateral relationship to move forward,‚Äù said Sylvie Bermann, a former French ambassador to the U.K. and author of a book on Brexit and Britain, ‚ÄúGoodbye Britannia.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;French officials say working with the Johnson administration is especially challenging as they feel the British leader constantly relitigates Brexit, even when discussing unrelated issues, for domestic political reasons.  
&gt;  
&gt;For French officials and many other European observers, the G7 summit of leading democracies, hosted by Johnson in Cornwall earlier this year, was a perfect illustration of the problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;The summit was meant to be the debut of ‚ÄúGlobal Britain,‚Äù Johnson‚Äôs vision for the U.K.‚Äôs enhanced international role outside the EU. But much of it was overshadowed by Brexit-related bickering.  
&gt;  
&gt;French officials noted that a week ahead of the summit, in a preparatory telephone conversation with Macron, Johnson was more focused on migration from Calais, and sausage deliveries to Northern Ireland ‚Äî two domestic priorities ‚Äî than on the main issues the leaders were meant to tackle such as global coronavirus vaccination efforts and relations with China.  
&gt;  
&gt;But in a sign of how far apart the two sides can be, not just on substance but on perspective, U.K. officials see the same spat quite differently.  
&gt;  
&gt;They say that Johnson was keen to move on from Brexit at the G7 ‚Äî but EU delegations adopted a coordinated approach to buttonhole him on the issue in successive bilateral meetings.

1668,"&gt;**Style separation**  
&gt;  
&gt;Another factor that stops the two leaders from getting on the same wavelength is their very different personal styles of practicing politics and international relations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Multiple officials say the French do not appreciate Johnson‚Äôs habit of getting on calls with his counterparts with little preparation and a seeming lack of interest in policy details.  
&gt;  
&gt;A British foreign ministry insider said that characterization was accurate, contrasting Johnson‚Äôs ‚Äúbroad brush‚Äù approach to diplomacy with Macron‚Äôs insistence on understanding every sentence.  
&gt;  
&gt;The leaders‚Äô differing views on the EU also affect their ability to work together bilaterally.  
&gt;  
&gt;French and other EU officials complain the U.K. is intent on bypassing the European Union and trying to work directly with individual member governments. One telling sign of that approach: the U.K.‚Äôs Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy mentions France 11 times; the European Union gets only a few passing references.  
&gt;  
&gt;French officials say that approach is severely limiting, given the EU is the biggest standard-setter in the world on issues like trade and climate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Notably, both countries failed to hold a joint event last November to mark the 10th anniversary of the Lancaster House treaties for defense and security cooperation.  
&gt;  
&gt;The coronavirus pandemic and the last weeks of Brexit negotiations provided the perfect excuse but in reality the main reason was that the two sides didn‚Äôt have much substance with which to mark the anniversary.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThere were no new projects to discuss when commemorating the Lancaster House Treaty,‚Äù Bermann said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, the two sides did hold a bilateral meeting of their foreign and defense ministers that produced a brief and bland statement. It was a far cry from the ambition of Lancaster House.  
&gt;  
&gt;A spokesperson for the U.K.‚Äôs Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, however, struck an upbeat note: ‚ÄúAs the foreign secretary has repeatedly made clear, the U.K. and France are close allies committed to tackling the shared challenges we face together, from climate change to global vaccine supply.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;**Common missions**  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs certainly not all bleak. France and the U.K. continue to work closely together within the U.N. Security Council, where they are the only European permanent members. They have also continued to work in lockstep within the E3 format in the ongoing negotiations of the Iran nuclear deal known, as the JCPOA.  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent days, Paris and London reached a deal to do more to curb illegal border crossings in small boats between Calais and the U.K.  
&gt;  
&gt;The two countries‚Äô militaries and navies also work closely together, in the fight against ISIS, within NATO missions and in Mali.  
&gt;  
&gt;And on both sides, though there is consensus that the relationship is going through a very difficult time, there are some officials encouraging calm and patience.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe should be aware of not giving in to the temptation of waiting out Boris Johnson or a reversal on Brexit, there is no indication that will happen,‚Äù the senior French official said. ‚ÄúWe have to be very patient and show how attached we are to the relationship even when it seems like it‚Äôs not mutual.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Sophia Gaston, director of the British Foreign Policy Centre think tank, said: ‚ÄúThere is a very strong foundation of common interests and values. These should become more, not less important in the future, particularly as the United States may remain an unpredictable partner for some time.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Some British officials offered an even more romantic take, pointing to a photo tweeted from space by French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, noting France is the closest European shore to the U.K. and suggesting the gap wasn‚Äôt so big.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIt seems to me that it has grown a little since my last mission ‚Ä¶ Yet some cross it in a jetpack!‚Äù Pesquet said.

Putin knows all of this and he exploits it to destabilise Georgia. But Georgia was led by the moron Saakashvili.

Georgia always had a reputation for being corrupt *even among the insanely corrupt USSR* so the fact that his Rose Revolution turned it all around is absolutely stunning, I see it as proof that if a capable leader replaced Putin, there may still be hope for Russia. 

However, Saakashvili is hopeless at diplomacy and foreign policy. He even left Ukraine and managed to muck things up there (to be fair, because his anti-corruption ethics didn't mesh well with the oligarchs there, but that's where you need to be more diplomatic). Putin baited him and got him to invade South Ossetia, which triggered Russian response, just as Putin planned. 

Condoleezza Rice even flew in last moment to try to save Georgia from going into war, but Saakashvili was delusional, he thought he could force Bush's hand and start a war which he theorised would be a Winter War 2.0 where Russians are stopped at chokepoints until US would come in and save the day.

1720,"&gt; They would‚Äôve taken any sort of vaccine, but had no choice, they got the Sputnik V vaccine. 


This is sadly what happens when one country out of a 27+ (plus as many other country follow the same rules) block decided to use a vaccine which is not permitted in the EU. The EMA has very high standards, the best in the world, and isn't political, so any vaccine that works and is safe could get approval. With Sputnik there are constant problems, as in EMA asks for more data, akin to that on others, and they don't provide, so the verification process is taking a long time.


&gt; The Sputnik V, which turned out to be one of the best and safest vaccines


Debatable. It seems to be one of the better ones, but due to limited trials and limited data available to all, tons less than on Astra or Pfizer, and even significantly less than on Moderna or J&amp;J, we cannot be sure. However it seems to be a good vaccine. But it's up to the company that wants EU approval (which is actually NOT even the Russian company making it, but an EU intermediary not fully affiliated for some reason) to give the exact same data as was supplied for the 4 approved ones. I know it's not your parents thought that they are in this situation, but the situation is the product of two things 1) the Russians weird we want but not really approach to approval and 2) the decision of the Hungarian government to not go the same route as the whole EU, which is insanely divided, but yet apart from Hungary and briefly Slovakia was united on going the EMA route.


&gt; And now my parents cannot go to France without a PCR test


Still they can go, its just a test.


&gt; they cannot go into a restaurant 48h after the test


Now this is an incentive for people to get vaccinated to stop an Autumn wave. It doesn't really have to take into consideration very small minorities from different countries, as it's to save the population and economy of France. Just look at vaccinations in France and Germany since true incentives for vaccinated individuals were introduced (France -&gt; upturn in numbers, Germany -&gt; study). And look at Poland where the populist government basically gave no incentives except no quarantine after international travel and not being counted to party limits (restaurants are open to all) -&gt; vaccination numbers have dwindled down to almost a halt after merely 58% of the population got them. So in case of an Autumn wave, Poland might be really f-ed in lockdown, while those countries that tried to increase vaccinations might prosper. So sure they will take the risk unless like Poland they have populist governments that are pro-vaccines (officially) but many of them aren't really...


One other thing to consider, we've seen pick and mix vaccinations, we've seen higher than permitted doses given by mistake, we've seen countries start boosters. So they always have the option of getting a vaccine OUTSIDE Hungary which would give them an EU certificate. With the one dose J&amp;J still accepted (though with Delta on slightly thin ice) this would be an easy choice. Pfizer or Moderna so fast after Sputnik would probably be redundant, but also would not be deadly. So where there is a will there is a way...

Anyway, to sum it up, your parents were ""screwed"" NOT by the EMA/EU, but by the Hungarian governments decision and a bit by the Sputnik manufacturer in no hurry to supply documents.",,/r/europe/comments/oxcqwr/vaccine_acceptance_rant/h7lrlui/,JoseMikey,1628027400

1780,"No, they all died on hunger strike, in protest at the British government's refusal to recognise them as enemy combatants. 

To make a complex story (overly) simple: Northern Ireland at the time was experiencing a civil war. The [IRA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army), an Irish socialist/nationalist paramilitary army, wanted to push the British state out of the province and have it reunify with the Republic of Ireland. On the other side, ""Loyalist"" groups like the [UVF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Volunteer_Force#:~:text=The%20Ulster%20Volunteer%20Force%20(UVF,Army%20soldier%20from%20Northern%20Ireland.&amp;text=The%20vast%20majority%20(more%20than,were%20often%20killed%20at%20random.) sought to ethnically cleanse the province, and either drive the ethnically Irish minority over the border into the neighbouring Irish state, or otherwise have them acknowledge Protestant, British ascendancy in the province. 

The origins of the conflict lay in the [17th-century British colonisation of the north of Ireland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster) with loyal, Protestant subjects and displacement of native Catholic Irish. Religion in Northern Ireland has functioned as a marker of British or Irish identity ever since.

The northern Irish state in the 20th century is generally accepted now by both sides to have been a ""Protestant supremacist"" state, what Nobel prize-winner peacemaker David Hume called [""a cold house for Catholics""](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1998/trimble/lecture/). Inspired by the civil rights movement for blacks in the United States, the Catholic minority in the North began [agitating for similar civil rights, such as equal voting and employment rights, and against large-scale state discrimination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_civil_rights_movement). This provoked a severe, violent backlash from hardline elements of the Protestant majority, with [refugees streaming over the southern border into the Irish Republic, who requested UN peacekeepers intervene](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/government-wanted-un-in-north-in-1969-papers-1.474208).

The IRA, which all the men shown in OP's image were members of, emerged in this context. They began a guerilla campaign to militarily liberate the province, which meant attacks largely on police and state infrastructure. Most of the Catholic minority didn't support this, initially. The British army was deployed to the province, and were initially welcomed by both sides as neutral outside forces to impose peace. Within a short time frame, the suspicion of the nationalist minority was that the British Army was essentially collaborating with Loyalist paramilitary groups like the above-mentioned UVF, and were not impartial at all. [This was later proven to be true on a very wide scale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens_Inquiries).

So, to the hunger strikers above: over the entire decade of the 1970s there was a great deal of bloodshed on all sides. When right-wing British PM Margaret Thatcher took power in 1975, she cancelled a previous mixed official policy towards the concerns of Northern Catholics, and took a much less concillatory line against the IRA (who would later come within [a hair's breadth](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-49797327) of assassinating her in Brighton in 1984, but I digress. Thatcher suspended habeas corpus in Northern Ireland, and ramped up a policy called [""internment""](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/internment-explained-when-was-it-introduced-and-why-1.3981598), meaning that anyone could be imprisoned without trial, indefinitely, on the say-so of security agencies. This resulted in the mass round-up and imprisonment of hundreds of Catholics, about half of whom are believed to have had no involvement whatsoever in paramilitary activity.

Most infuriatingly to the IRA however, was Thatcher's insistence that this wasn't any sort of war, and that the whole conflict was just a common criminal matter. Under international law, certain provisions must be extended to enemy combatants in a war, which aren't required for normal civil policing. In 1981, nationalist prisoners began their hunger strike for ""political"" status, which they believed to be key to the ""hearts and minds"" aspect of their conflict. It helped that one of the strikers, Bobby Sands, was actually elected as a British MP during his hunger strike. 10 of them would ultimately die on hunger strike, including the MP Bobby Sands.

It was ultimately felt that the death in prison of an elected representative marked a change in international perception of Britain's position on the North, which began to be seen as intransigent and somewhat unreasonable by key international allies, most especially the US.

There's a great [film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_(2008_film)) the whole thing called ""Hunger"" by a British director, that I think tends to be on Netflix in most EU countries.

Although it's probably obvious where my sympathies lie (I'm Irish after all!) hopefully this was a relatively informative write-up on the whole thing!

1925,"&gt; We need to think about the planet and about each other and driving some old gas guzzlers is not the way to go.

Keep living in that dream world of yours.

Even with the infrastructure, reasonable initial cost, good build quality (Tesla has ridiculous bad build quality and ergonomics), and of course battery tech... not everybody would want to shift to EVs. The reality, in most European countries and cultures, is that most people will rather get a 10k ‚Ç¨ 5 year old basic Audi A4, Golf or small SUV over a Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Corsa-E or, in a couple of years, 5 year old Model 3. A part of it is the vegan-esque attitude some people have. 

This EVs-are-the-ultimate-eco-answer crusade and hard-on some people have is making people uncomfortable and even more reluctant to shift to EVs. Trying to shame people into converting is not gonna do you any favors, just like it's not doing any favors to vegans or some other obnoxiously self righteous group. What about cruise ships? Freight transport? Anything business related? Why harass regular people, and especially those who enjoy their ICE powered contemporary horse equivalent?

What's next, claiming we should abandon nuclear plants in favor of 100% hydro and solar? That we're supposed to shift towards lab grown meat and insect based diet?

1943," ""We could have had a genuine debate about the EU / future direction of the UK but instead we had evil, divisive, misleading, self-serving propaganda lies.""

And at multiple points that was tried, but the Remain side resorted to calling that propaganda, evil, divisive and misleading. Also divisive isn't an argument. Politics is divisive. By that logic I could say ""Don't vote Labour, that's divisive"". Brexit isn't unique in it's divisiveness.

"" US capitol attack: different to what is happening in the UK but also similar to Brexit with a divisive scapegoating and made-up narrative. My boss is a Brexiteer and we discussed it at length over years. He was also a Trump sympathiser who laughed at my saying how the lies, propaganda, corruption, incompetence and hatred stoking might end. I was heartened that, 4 years later, he did disavow his previous position and admit he was wrong after the 6th. The point is that plenty of people didn't think the lies/corruption in the US would degenerate as fast as they have. Who knows what will happen in the UK but we are seeing a similar if milder (for now?) version of the same thing. I tend to see Arendt as an authority on this kind of stuff and subscribe to what she said about corruption, political lies, the abandonment of standards of thought, and what that can lead to. We may be behind but certainly we have taken steps down the same path. Hopefully we can be smarter.""

Yeah you're being very vague. ""Lies, corruption, propaganda, hate stoking"". Like what point are you making, these ate sounding more like buzzwords every time you use them. Also ""Trump Sympathizer""? Classy terminology right there. I wouldn't refer you as a Euro Sympathizer.

""Fox, OAN et al are just pure right-wing extremist propaganda""

Yeah you're pretty much using propoganda as a buzz word at this point. OAN? I've never heard of it. Fox? Right-wing extremism? Like I don't like Fox, but I wouldn't call them Far-right or extremist. I have no idea where you are on the overtone window, but moderate people wouldn't say it's extremist. 

I don't care how genuine CNN is, but either it's very different from your idea of how Brexit happened. Because it was opposed to Trump.

""Remainers are self-interested - this is vague unsubstantive whataboutism, no? Maybe you could be specific otherwise it's impossible to talk about it meaningfully.""

Tbh I feel like this conversation isn't having much meaningful effect on either of us but to your point. Sorry I meant the EU not remainers. The EU elite, the Eurocrats, the European establishment whatever people call it.

""I think what people missed about that is that we could have vetoed those elements indefinitely and the ""European superstate"" boogieman was just that, overblown fear-mongering nonsense.""

Could we really have done that? At multiple points nations have tried and failed to do that. 

Also there are multiple points shown if an infringing European Superstate. For one they EU has an army, and is now planning on using that army to guard borders instead of the actual srmee forces of countries. It's funny because Eurosceptics have been saying that would happen for a LONG time and they were mocked for it. But then it happened and there is either no mention of it or it's defended. It was seen as a conspiracy but then it came true. The EU has a national anthem for gods sake. Which fun fact: they weren't allowed to have. Or at the very least the EU agreed they wouldn't. I think there might have been a law in fact. But then they took ""Ode to Joy"" as it's anthem. They stand up to attention and all that good stuff. And no matter what you think of the man, Nigel Farage rightfully pointed this out. When he stood seated and refused to stand for ""Ode to Joy"" when President Juncker said something like ""It's disrespectful to not stand for a nations national anthem"", Garage rightfully pointed out the EU wasn't a nation. It's clear to a certain degree the EU (or it's leaders) think of itself as a nation, or a pushing for that. 

""I hope so as we will eventually have to but we have both taken ourselves out of a leadership position with plenty of influence over the EU and lied about and denigrated our neighbours to the extent that there is now plenty of unnecessary bad blood""

That relies on the EU being willing to as well I'm afraid. And it seems they aren't that willing. Which tbh is fairly petty. Also good. I don't want the UK to have a leadership position in the EU. No country should have a leadership position in the EU. The UK shouldn't have authority over Poland or Croatia or any other nation in the EU. And vice-versa. Also bad blood always existed. At least now we don't have to be disrespected by them. Brexit hasn't changed much in that regard. We didn't lie or denigrate our neighbours either.

2010,"Not necessarily. The latin (read: preferred at the time) name was Sacrum Imperium Romanum, which translates as Holy Roman Empire. Originally it was referred to just as the Roman Empire, but later on Holy was attached to the front because it was very Catholic and the Pope/Church was heavily involved (ecclesiastical land account for over a one-third of the land at many points). According to Wikipedia, Friedrich I has ambitions to dominate and take over as the main authority from the Papacy and over Italy, which was always a bit of a rebellious portion. 

While it eventually lost Rome, it's weird that it can't be referred to as the Holy Roman Empire because of that. The Byzantine Empire briefly had Rome for it's over 1000 year existence, but no one disputes the name Eastern Roman Empire, even though they had lost all Roman attributes by the 700s, besides Christianity. 

When it comes to an Empire, it certainly was until the advent of Protestantism (or even before that with Italy slowly slipping away or the Hussites in Bohemia). Before that, the Emperor could and would throw his weight around and was definitely the main person in charge of secular affairs. It was also an Empire since it was vast, contained a multitude of different ethnic groups and people's (though mainly German and Italian), and had the legitimacy/authority to be an Empire.",,/r/europe/comments/owy8r9/map_of_europe_and_its_surroundings_at_the_year/h7kbl5q/,TheWiseBeluga,1628005672

2044,"Prussia was in fact the duchy of Brandenburg. However the Brandenburg dynasty inherited the duchy of Prussia from the Teutonic Knights and then independently elevated it to a kingdom. This was meant to give them equal dynastic standing to the Austrian Habsburgs and meant they had titles independent and not bound to the HRE.

They specifically called themselves Kings ""in"" Prussia to disconnect themselves. This was important as obviously an emperor could rule kings if those royal titles would fall within the empire (e.g. Kingdom of Bohemia, Italy and Germany in feudal times)

similarily the dukes of Saxony were elected Kings of Poland several times. 

In a similar vein the House of Hannover became the kings of Great Britain and thus had an equal title to the emperor and could use that to have the duchy ignore imperial control. However at the same time the duchy had a separate legsl standing where it was still Debbie part of the HRE.

obviously the Habsburgs were the archetype of this by ruling over the duchy of Austria As well as Hungary, bohemia, Croatia and parts of Italy, giving it vast power and resources outside the HRE.

the thing is, those territories pbviously were never made part of the HRE by any side and the HRE remained its distinct political entity whatever its princes controlled outside of it.

an inverted case are the duchy of Holstein, ruled in personal Union by the Danish kings, while being ducal titles of the HRE. It had a separate governmental body and laws to be within the HRE while the Danish kings could exert direct control. That is where the 19th century war happened around, an incorporation of the German duchy into the Danish realm, removing it from the then German Confederation (as successor of the Hre)

 The duchy of Bavaria is an opposite example and it's dukes in essence flourished by being staunch Catholic Vasalls to the emperors for the entirety of the Hre's existence.",,/r/europe/comments/owy8r9/map_of_europe_and_its_surroundings_at_the_year/h7kc1fi/,mangalore-x_x,1628005863

2081,"Preliminary results show that up to sixty percent of seniors have significantly lower or no antibodies after six months of vaccination. This results from an analysis conducted by the Helping Hands Society on more than 620 seniors. According to her, there will soon be a need for a third dose of vaccination and an increase in testing of staff and clients in social services.

Such seniors, who will effectively become unvaccinated again, will increase by hundreds of thousands in the coming months. The first people vaccinated are from late January, and by mid-February, 163,000 people had received both required vaccines. By mid-August, it is estimated that statistically there will be over a hundred thousand people over the age of 80 and therefore in the risk group again in terms of antibody-free.

The company tested 627 elderly people from 30 June to 2 July. Those interested could sign up via the published booking system. They then submitted a blood sample for antibodies. ""We use two different types of tests to maximally capture the antibody response, both after the infection and after vaccination.

In a selected group of project participants, antibody level testing will be complemented by cellular immunity testing. It is expected that this approach will provide knowledge that will comprehensively assess the state of immunity to the causative agent of covid-19 and will be acceptable in the general population,"" said Petr Husa, Head of the Infectious Diseases Clinic at the University Hospital Brno.

Of the seniors who participated in the measurement, 396 were under 75 years of age, 231 were older. They were most often vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, but all types of vaccines, both two-dose and single-dose, were included in the survey.

The results of the analysis show that antibody levels decrease with time since vaccination and with age. **According to the company, the drop in antibody levels is dramatic, with up to 60 percent of vaccinees having negative levels four months or more after vaccination.** It also shows that seniors who have had covid-19 have higher antibody levels than those who have not had the disease.

AstraZeneca fares the worst
The degree of dependency also varies depending on the type of vaccine, with AstraZeneca performing the worst so far, according to Hands Off. People who are vaccinated with AstraZeneca and have not had covid come out lowest. ""In Israel, they are already offering people over 60 a third dose of the vaccine.

And preliminary results of our investigation also suggest that a booster dose should be available for vulnerable groups as early as the fall. The government should have a prevention plan especially in social service facilities, where the greatest number of deaths have occurred,"" said Henry Voboril, director of Helping Hands.

Podan√© ruce is now preparing the next phase of the investigation in cooperation with the Diocesan Charity of Brno and the Statutory City of Brno, in which they will focus on laboratory investigations, especially of cellular immunity. At the same time, Podan√© Rƒôce is trying to develop its own mobile tracing system, i.e. not via telephone, but with the help of mobile teams on site and with the help of specially trained teams.

2141,"Not to drag this too off topic but I believe this is a huge reason why the Mongols left in 1242.  Germany and really all of western Europe was a clusterfuck of interlocking principalities, kingdomlets, regions and city-states each with its own castles and armies.  There was no one big force to defeat and then take the whole country.  

That coupled with less favorable terrain that featured lots of forests and even mountains (ie no grazing lands for the half a million horses) and it was going to be a huge undertaking.  Not impossible mind you but one has to also remember that it took the Mongols 50 years to conquer all of China and China is right next door to Mongolia. 

Imagine the supply lines and/or infrastructure one has to build in order to sustain a 50+ year conflict thousands of km away from Mongolia.  It's not that I think they couldn't do it, I just think they knew it wasn't worth the effort.  The Mongols weren't stupid.  

Also they came mighty close to a defeat against the Hungarians and a huge reason for that were the heavily armoured Polish and German mounted knights.

Now we have swimmers that are even faster than them, that athletically outperform those who tested positive, and you think they did this through what, the power of love?

They're all equally dedicated, if the guy who came 7th tests positive, it is absurd to think anyone *ahead* of him was doing so clean. And I say 'clean' as if it makes sense to judge them for doing one more thing to excel as athletes.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/owv4pr/karsten_warholm_from_norway_becomes_olympic/h7j9tfq/,Downgoesthereem,1627984032

2392,"In totalitarian regimes, there are certain things you cannot say. You can't question the prevailing beliefs of the day, for example:

1. being gay is not a choice, it's something you're born with. (gay propaganda doesn't turn kids gay).
2. being gay is perfectly natural
3. being gay has no disadvantages compared to being straight (except for discrimination)
4. being gay is not a sin before God
5. hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery is the best option for transgender folks.
6. queer folks should have equal rights

These statements are supported by the LGBT movement but as far as I know only the even numbered ones (2-4-6) are undisputed ground-level truths. The movement did a great job dispelling those myths and elevating queer folks to straight status. It was a tough fight but they did it and I'm happy we got this far. If you question 2-4-6 and you get labeled a BIGOT, I'm not going to defend you. 

But this is where things start to turn totalitarian. If any criticism of LGBT claims results in getting cancelled, how can we be sure those claims are true?   


I'd prefer that everyone accepts 2-4-6 as truths and so A) queer people have an easier time in our societies, and B) people questioning 1-3-5 don't immediately get cancelled.  


No, gay sex isn't disgusting, it's fun and natural and not a sin and there are great people doing it, but do I want my kid to learn this in his formative years if there's the slightest chance that this turns him gay and thus prevents him from having kids from the person he loves?

Our current electricity network isnt built for that kind of power balancing (operators have to balance the usage with supply to keep it around 230v or whatever the standard is where you are)

So i heard a solution which was they want to add remotely controllable outlets for electric car chargers, which the electricity company can control to make sure it doesnt overload the network.
So will that mean we cant charge our cars? Or maybe electricity prices will rise sky high?

2759,"I honestly think you may be overestimating the influence of the church in the daily life of Italian people. Given how empty churches are (except maybe non-urban areas in southern Italy) and the general lack of religious culture, I guess that most people don't even know that killing oneself would be a sin.

Many (most?) of those who have religious marriages or baptize their newborn do so because of tradition more than real faith, and priests close both eyes when it comes to perform such pro forma celebrations. For the same reason, nowadays nobody would deny a funeral to anyone, let alone a burial in ""consecrated"" land since cemeteries are managed by towns and it would be practically impossible to discriminate. The trick is to say that the suicide victim wasn't of sound mind when they killed themselves, therefore they were unable to understand they were about to commit a sin, therefore it wasn't a sin after all because it requires full awareness to be considered as such, therefore they could have a religious funeral etc. etc. and the face of everyone is saved.

According to recent polls, about 80% of Italians agree that a law on euthanasia is necessary, i.e. the church has far more serious problems than suicides.

As for the classification of deaths as suicides vs. other causes, given that there would be health officials involved (not one's family doctor) and possibly the police too, the chance of having a suicide classed as some other accident is rather low. Maybe socially people would refrain to speak loudly about the matter, although privately they would talk about it, but from a statistical point of view there would be no doubt. Although it never happened to anyone close to me, I have a feeling that the topic would be somewhat avoided out of tactfulness towards the family of the dead rather than shame or disgrace. In other words it would be the social safety net others write about in this same thread that would work towards relieving the pain of the family of the dead by avoiding to rub it in. I don't know if it works the same in other cultures but here the causes of untimely death are usually more or less kept private, only the family and very intimate friends would know the details, others do not need to know.",Emilia-Romagna,/r/europe/comments/owbmma/death_rate_from_suicides_per_100000_people_in/h7i9dld/,gerri_,1627958155

But, the reality is, irrespective of that, if the big 3 stopped contributing financially (Germany, France, Italy) - the EU would fail, irrespective of their contribution per capita.  But if Malta, Romania and Greece stopped contributing, even if their contribution per capita was higher, it would barely cause a ripple. 

City of London, ok I understand. Well, there's certainly equal opportunity, whether there is equality of outcome though, that may be different.  But, the UK wasn't the only EU member state with good financial systems to help benefit.  But those systems existed before the EU, and as such, their success cant solely be attributed to EU membership as you allude, and I would be confident in saying that even if we hadn't joined the EU, the 'city' would still have been strong and healthy.  Similarly, if there is equal opportunity/access for all states, there's nothing preventing smaller states from setting up these systems now and benefiting.

If, as you say, the UK blocked other countries from benefitting financially, then it was foolish of the EU to allow the UK to join in the first place, so thats on the EU, and foolish of other states to join once the UK was in, and that's on those other states.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/ow9ucz/poll_brits_blame_eu_for_northern_ireland_trade/h7hraoi/,Iggmeister,1627949453

Segregation only existed because it was in law, my dude. It didn't exist without the law. This is in even the most basic history textbooks on racial segregation.

&gt;We're not talking about free speech issues. We're talking about discriminating on the basis of race or gender.

Which is a freedom of association issue. The same arguments around freedom of speech apply to freedom of association.

&gt;In effect, you're arguing in favor of rewriting the laws to ignore

Nope, I'm calling for laws not to exist. I'm calling for deregulation.

&gt;Where did I talk about marriage?

I swapped one human right out for another to show how absurd your statement is.

&gt;Labour isn't far-left

Current Labour (well, besides the Corbyn lot) is not far left, Labour under Attlee in 1945 very much was: mass nationalisations (+20% of the economy), creating the NHS, cradle to grave' welfare state, many changes to workers rights, etc.

Nope, equality only applies to acts of government, not private individuals/businesses. Again, this is why justice is blind, but you get to choose who you sleep with.

Sure it is.

From that example we can learn that sanctioning sporting events has none, or the opposite of the desired effect. And therefore the only people who suffer as a consequence would be the athletes, the innocent oppressed population, and the sporting organization (Olympics) as a whole because they lose credibility once they dabble in geopolitics.

That's simply false; we have almost at will employment only excluding union representatives, maternity/paternity leaves and people with temporary part-time work reduction due to family care of minors under 12 (this was an odd political thing). And you still can fire those for disciplinary or economic reasons.

BTW, being able to fire always, doesn't mean that firing is free. At will firing cost 33 days of salary/years of employment.

If you are looking at Heritage data (whose methodology is very questionable). You can simply look at [France](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/france) or [Sweden](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/sweden) with more rigid labor markets than [Spain](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/spain).

 This is dueSpain lack of restrictions for  temp employment and Spain being possible to fire most workers at any moment (even if firing for economic reasons people with 10+ years of seniority is more expensive than Sweden or France).

Crime is at historical lows, and California isn‚Äôt even one of the worst crime states (at 19th) despite its absurdly high population. Homelessness is a complex issue. Housing prices are sky high because California is wonderful: great weather, great infrastructure, great income potential and progressive policies (despite what you think most Californians love their social freedoms - just dislike taxes that aren‚Äôt transparent), high out of state homeless immigration (20% - likely higher when accounting for only visible street homeless), and policies that don‚Äôt just remove homeless from visibility (which I disagree with) which doesn‚Äôt actually fix problems (red states are renown for this).

1st topic: The problem is that Tesla is using parts that are not fulfilling the requirements needed in Automotive design. In the same way you can't use a normal Intel processor in a Motor control unit (no lockstep, no advanced memory protection functionality, ...), you also can't use a normal tablet display to fulfill certain functions. 

When you have an error you need to inform the driver. Depending on the error you need to do this with a certain integrity level (look up ASIL). That means, you can't just send a message on the bus ""activate the lamp"" and believe everything is good. You have to read back the status of the lamp to know that it is really on and if not on you have to activate replacement functions. Unlike LEDs, there is simply no way to read back the status of pixels in a display. 

Every manufacturer uses pixel displays now, but they include a part with real LEDs because of that problem. Tesla doesn't.

2nd topic: Please read again, I said that Tesla ANNOUNCED a touchscreen shifter.

One more thing: you read a comment by someone who is clearly an expert and he is criticizing something you like. It is obviously not a nice read and I understand some amount of scepticism (I mean it is clear that I work for the competition). But your misinterpretation is just ridiculous and tells me a bit about you.

People used the codes of other people to gain entrance while having COVID. We saw massive spikes in infections. Which were again followed by a rise in hospitalisations.

Not a massive amount but a steady rise. The problem is that is that hospitals have to work at 140% of normal capacity to work away the backload from COVID. 140% with less staff then before COVID when it already was to little.

Hospitals can not keep doing both. Every COVID patient gets in the way of another pati√´nt. Zo when this is preventable bij a vaccine or sanitary pass then that is absolutely justified. 

Saying enough is enough is just the dumbest thing ever. What does it even mean? You have had it everybody else can just go and die?

3411,"The thing is, electric cars have the following practical advantages:

* high torque from the start, so very powerful acceleration

* quiet motor

* no room needed for engine and for massive transmission, which leads to:
  * frunk
  * more interior space
  * flat interior floor (which offers more flexibility for the interior)

* motors are small and can be placed close to wheels and don't need as bulky an axle as for internal combustion engines, which leads to:
  * longer wheelbase (more stable car, both for sudden maneuvers and when cornering)
  * wheels closer to the corners of the cars (so shorter turning radius)

Hybrids only get the high torque and quiet motor part, and that's usually at low speeds. Which is nice, but meh.

Everything else is thrown away because hybrids are kind of the worst of both world (you need both the engine **and** batteries).

From an ecological point of view they're kind of nice, because they reduce emissions a bit. But you need true battery electric vehicles, the ones that have a platform designed around that, to get the real benefits of electric vehicles.

3530,"&gt;why is the Catholic church still so strong in Poland

History. You need to understand this - during nearly all of Polish history, when terrible things happened, people used religion to survive in this country and to hold to their identity, when Polish culture was being destroyed.

When Poland was partitioned, Polish people went to church to remain Polish. When WW2 happened, Polish people went to church to remain Polish. When there was a communist regime, guess what, Polish people went to church to remain Polish. Because of that, church and religion were put on a pedestal - and now, when we are finally free, they think they have a right to reign people, just like in ""good ol' times"". 

Remember the quote ""it's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head""? That's exactly the description of the situation in Poland now.

The Hitachi/GE/Toshiba reactors at Fukushima, for instance had spent fuel rods that still generated a lot of heat and could be put into a secondary reactor to generate electricity not through turbines, but maybe thermoacoustic or sterling engines.

Granted the disasters were a PR nightmare, but they failed because they were not engineered to be failsafe, but instead to be built as cheaply as possible to get a return on investment in the US, and in the USSR it was corruption (I had a long conversation with someone years ago who researched it and knew a lot about USSR politics).

There are ways to engineer reactors and deal with waste, but the initial commitment to make it happen runs into political inertia and we suffer the paradox of the lowest bidder as well as the political corruption that comes from lobbyists and other for-profit corporate interests.

3836,"First: I've made it clear that I believe countries can succeed without authoritarianism, and especially without totalitarianism.  I'm not even sure you disagree with that, though you seem to be trying very hard to convince me otherwise.

My historical theory is simple: If the Chinese Nationalists had won the Civil war, either because Japan didn't escalate the war in 1937 or had devastated the communists just as badly as they did the nationalists, China wouldn't have lost three decades.  And I've also made it clear that I understand the Nationalists were actually fairly authoritarian (which according to you, is great for economic growth anyway), though with democratic elements.  They were doing pretty damn well up until they found themselves in a total war with Japan.  I expect that would have continued.  Mistakes would have been made, of course, but it's well understood in foreign policy circles that the more democratic a nation is the faster it can change course.  Importantly, the same elements of civil society that survived in Taiwan would have survived in the mainland, leading hopefully to an eventual democratic outcome and a decent government today.

Like all alternate history, it's obviously impossible to know for sure.  Maybe the nationalists would have found a way to screw up just as badly as the communists did historically, however unlikely that would seem given the history we know.  And consider as well that a Nationalist government would have been on much better terms with the West, and all that means in terms of trade and investment.",,/r/europe/comments/ovrcxw/belarusian_athlete_in_the_tokyo_olympics_kryscina/h7e6i3y/,Doxun,1627878062

3874,"The Battle of Cannae was fought near the ancient village of Cannae on 2 August 216 BCE, in southern Apulia (modern Puglia), southeastern Italy, between the forces of Rome and Carthage during the Second Punic War. 

The Romans were crushed by the African, Gallic, and Celtiberian troops of Hannibal, with recorded Roman losses ranging from 55,000 (according to Roman historian Livy) to 70,000 (according to Greek historian Polybius). One of the most significant battles in history, it is regarded by military historians as a classic example of a victorious double envelopment.

Hannibal was the first to arrive at the battle site, with a force of about 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. His army took command of the Aufidus (now Ofanto) River, the main source of water in the area. That added to the strain on the Romans, who would struggle to satisfy the thirst of their greater number of soldiers in the early August heat. 

Hannibal positioned his lines facing north, compelling the Romans to face mostly to the south, where the hot libeccio wind blew dust and grit into their eyes, an irritant and disadvantage that, according to ancient authorities, cannot be ignored. In addition, Hannibal confined the eight Roman legions in a narrow valley, hemmed in by the river.

In one stroke, Hannibal thus restricted the mobility of the Roman cavalry and forced the Roman infantry to adopt a formation that was deeper than it was wide, two factors that would prove critical in the outcome of the battle.

Breaking from the Fabian strategy of nonengagement, the Roman consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro brought to Cannae roughly 80,000 men, about half of whom lacked significant battle experience. They sought to meet Hannibal, who had just taken a highly coveted grain depot at Canusium, in the hope of delivering a knockout blow and ending the destructive Carthaginian invasion of Italy. Terentius Varro had been popularly elected as a plebeian consular political appointee, and ancient sources describe his character as overconfident and rash, ascribing to him the hope that he could overwhelm Hannibal with sheer numbers. Aemilius Paullus, however, was both a veteran and patrician from an established military family, and he was justifiably cautious about facing Hannibal on his enemy‚Äôs terms.

The Romans faced southwest, with their right wing resting on the Aufidus and with the sea about three miles (five kilometres) to their rear. They placed their cavalry (about 6,000) on their wings and massed their infantry in an exceptionally deep and narrow formation in the centre in the hope of breaking the enemy centre by weight and push. To counter that, Hannibal relied on the elasticity of his formation. He stationed his Gallic and Spanish infantry in the centre, two groups of his African troops on their flanks, and the cavalry on the wings. But before engaging the enemy, his line adopted a crescent shape, the centre advancing with the African troops on their flanks en √©chelon. As Hannibal had anticipated, his cavalry won the struggle on the wings, and some then swept around behind the enemy.

Manwhile, the Roman infantry gradually forced back Hannibal‚Äôs centre, and victory or defeat turned upon whether the latter held. It did: although it fell back, it did not break, and the Roman centre was gradually drawn forward into a trap. Hannibal‚Äôs crescent became a circle, with Hannibal‚Äôs African and Spanish troops on the wings pressing inward on the Romans and the Carthaginian cavalry attacking from the rear. Some of the equipment used by troops engaging the Roman flanks‚Äîespecially shields and other armour‚Äîhad been taken from dead Romans after the Carthaginian victory at Trasimene. That may have further confused the Romans, who were already fighting through a steady torrent of dust. Pressed tightly together and hence unable to properly use their arms, the Romans were surrounded and cut to pieces. It is possible that the falcata, a brutally effective curved short sword employed by Celtiberian troops, played some role in the dismemberment of the Roman ranks.

Terentius Varro fled the field of battle with the remnants of the Roman and allied cavalry. Aemilius Paullus was killed along with many other high-ranking commanders, including Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, Marcus Minucius Rufus, and other veteran patricians. Among the Roman dead were 28 of 40 tribunes, up to 80 Romans of Senatorial or high magistrate rank, and at least 200 knights (Romans of equestrian rank). It was estimated that 20 percent of Roman fighting men between the ages of 18 and 50 died at Cannae. Only 14,000 Roman soldiers escaped, and 10,000 more were captured; the rest were killed. The Carthaginians lost about 6,000 men.

When word of the defeat reached Rome, panic gripped the city, and women flocked to temples to weep for their lost husbands, sons, and brothers. Hannibal was exhorted to march on Rome by Maharbal, one of his commanders, but Hannibal did not do so. Livy reports that Maharbal then told Hannibal that he knew how to win battles but not how to take advantage of them. For his part, Hannibal had hoped that many South Italians would desert Rome and ally with him after his crushing victory. 

In spite of the massive blow to Rome‚Äôs morale and its manpower in the short term, Cannae ultimately steeled Roman resistance for the long fight ahead.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/napa-locals-go-cowboy-bulldozing-firebreaks-to-save-wineries-as-resources-wane/ar-BB18sJu7

&gt;When the Hennessey Fire ignited in Napa‚Äôs eastern hillsides on Aug. 17, Weinert and his crew were at Ovid Vineyards, in the middle of a job clearing 25 acres of rock for a new vineyard. Suddenly, they could spot smoke rising from the other end of Pritchard Hill, behind Chappellet Winery.
&gt;
&gt;The Ovid team reached out to Cal Fire, but ‚Äúwith so many fires up and down the state, we knew they‚Äôd be stretched pretty thin,‚Äù said General Manager Jack Bittner. It soon became clear that if they wanted to keep the Hennessey Fire from advancing, they would have to fight it themselves.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have any expectation that the cavalry was coming,‚Äù Bittner said.
&gt;
&gt;What Weinert and a neighboring vineyard-development crew accomplished over the next few days was extraordinary: Using their bulldozers, they cleared chaparral, brush and other vegetation to create a nearly 4-mile firebreak across Pritchard Hill.

4029,"""anti polish""

That is like saying you are anti semitic in 16th century, it was normal. Dont make Prussians appear artificially evil.

And the reason the germans, not prussians, had something against Poland, can easily be found in the End of WW1 where Poland took german territory by military means in open vioolation of the european armistice.

And even when there was a vote on the territory Poland violated it and started a war (look up the upper silesian vote 1919). From the german point of view at the time Poland attacked them because Poland dint like the reuslt of the vote (60% of the inhabitants of upper silesia voted to remain with germany). This even resulted in the collabse of the german gouvernment of the time and was a major reason why Germans were pissed with Poland.

And well there was that hole Danzig buisness

And considering this is 1944 the polish partisans. The polish partisans usually didnt wear uniforms and acted more like what we expect modern terrorists to act like in the way they conducted combat from the german armies point of view. So from the german pov there was absolutely no love for the poles, and especially the partisans which participated in this Uprising. For the germans this was basically a ""chance"" to get revenge on partisans for partisan warfare becuase they were finally clear and out in the open resulting in the city getting eradicated. For the german soldiers it was the same as having al quaida that terrorized them for years come out in one city and present themselfs.

Additionally, it was a major middle finger to german rule in all the remaining occupied territories and germany couldnt allow that to remian unanswered from a political position.

Also when will people finally stop arguing with the ""prussia was a polish vassal and therefore hated Poland"" bullhist. The prussian part of ""Prussia"" wasnt even the dominant part of the state. The important part was the area of Brandenburg, an elector state in the HRE that inherited Prussia and then took the title of ""Prussians/King in Prussia"" for political reasons to boost prestige. Didnt make them have any relation to the prussians and there relationship to Poland before. And the main reason they expaned into the land of the commonwealth was the same reason all HRE states in the middle ages and age of Enlightenment expanded: To connect their disconnected holdings all over the place with each other

4049,"ah, I was waiting for a comment like this. The good old ""the west didnt help the poles during their uprising"" myth. Apparently it will never die.

The polish partisans didnt even inform the western high commands that they were rising up so no major allied support in supplies could be planned to begin with. You dont start air dropping supplies on the other side of europe over hostlie lands within a day.

And the allies tried to get airdrops to the rebels but the soviets denied them the use of their airfields and the airdrops that did happen from bases in Italy usually just landed in the hands of the germans because the polish rebels didnt really secure a majority of warsaw and didnt inform the allies on where to drop the supplies.

The more you look into the uprising the more you realize how badly it was actually planned. it was a short term reaction by the polsih rebels to the soviets advance but apparently they  didnt realize that the germans just destroyed the soviet armoured spearhead just south of warsaw and that the soviet advance was stopped close to the city so the soviets would help. Also they knew that the soviets wouldnt help them because other uprising attempts eastwards of warsaw were crushed when the soviet forces arrived instead of getting help. They didnt plan for anything after the first few hours and that resulted in the slaughter that was the warsaw uprising with the civilians as usually caught in the crossfire and getting their city eradicated as a result.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ovthuu/today_is_the_77th_anniversary_of_the_warsaw/h7dehwa/,BlueNoobster,1627862722
4050,"&gt; I don't care about your ramblings except one part and ofcourse as expected you dodged and instead made a low iq remark that you probably considered to be witty. I never claimed I'm deciding anything when it comes to turkey's policies. However I claimed that anti-refugee sentiments shouldn't be reduced to racism as you do. 

It is. Several interviews were made with people whether they'd be more favorable to refugees from Azerbaijan than Syria and an overwhelming majority were  favorable.   
  
Also, even in r/turkey (but also identical in all other Turkish media), people insulted and humiliated Arabs regarding Syrian refugees. I'm waiting for your denial so that I can respond with my save of several messages from 2 weeks ago.  
   
&gt; If you can't put those people to work due to a failing economy these people become a drain on a countries ressources since you have to feed and house them and depending on the number of refugees this can be significant burdon   
  
I already covered that   
   
&gt;Germany's economy was never anything close to that of the current Turkish economy post ww2.   
   
Germany had just lost a major war (worse than WWI Ottoman Empire lost), were occupied for 50 years by both the West and Soviet Union splitting the country for 50 years, and you claim that what Turkey goes thru is worse?

4056,"I don't think you understand my stance in this. The mainstream media, especially in Turkey can't be trusted for shit. This should be common knowledge and it isn't even worth arguing. But i've witnessed a deliberate misinformation campaign regarding this case and it seriously pissed me off. 

The first reports i've seen literally mentioned a group of 60 murdering a Kurdish family just because they were Kurdish, i was horrified but it didn't make that much sense, sure we do have racist attacks against Kurds in Turkey from time to time even some major ones like Madƒ±mak (though the targets were more likely atheists and alevis there) but it isn't that common simply for the fact that Kurds are pretty well integrated in Turkey, they have a significant presence in pretty much every Turkish city and they aren't really an isolated group. Anyways, turns out the first reports i've seen were complete lies. There is video evidence of the crime that very clearly disproves the narrative. At this point i'm just done with fake news no matter who does it. 

&gt;Look at the funeral in Konya. So many politicians went. Non Kurdish ones. Samething happened in a murder in Ankara. Why are so many government officials going to Kurdish funerals if they are simple issues among citizens?

Only thing this proves is that there have been a significant reaction after this event, doesn't matter if it was actually a racist attack or not, politicians will care about their image, some will try ti show that they stand in solidarity with them and some will just want them to shut up.

4094,"&gt;People have been making claims that the PKK is burning the country for a week without any substance and the whole country jumped on it. Not very surprising. This is Turkey.

They've been making this since there is an entire sub-PKK group dedicated to this. Though they rarely take actual action. Most of the time they claim responsibility for the events they didn't take part in, so it is dumb to trust their words on this. Even more so when Italy and Greece is experiencing a similiar thing with the fires. But most of Turkey is dumb so this doesn't surprise me. 

That being said, there have been documented arson attempts mostly near military zones, bases etc but the fires did not grow and assailants have been arrested. So it's not like there is no reason to blame PKK either. I just think of it as shifting the blame though.

4199,"Booster vaccines are to be offered to 32million Britons starting early next month with up to 2,000 pharmacies set to deliver the programme, The Telegraph can disclose.

Amid fears that the efficacy of the vaccines may begin to decline, ministers are planning to deliver an average of almost 2.5million third doses a week starting in the first week of September. 

Pharmacies will be at the forefront of the vaccine programme so that GPs and other NHS staff can focus on the growing backlog of patients waiting for other treatments.

All adults aged 50 and over, as well as the immuno-suppressed, will be offered the booster jabs.

The campaign could start as soon as Sept 6, which would see the rollout completed by early December if it goes to plan. It is hoped the timetable will leave at least a fortnight for the final people vaccinated to benefit from the jab's effect before Christmas.

Proposals have been drawn up for the Covid-19 vaccine to be co-administered alongside the flu jab, with one injection in each arm mooted.

‚ÄúThat is the plan, wherever possible,‚Äù said a government source, but stressed it ‚Äúdepends on final JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] advice and coronavirus vaccine booster trials‚Äù.

The source added that ministers were ‚Äúlooking to beat our record of jabs per day‚Äù. To date, the highest tally of doses given in a single day was 873,784, which occurred on March 20. The feat was equivalent to vaccinating the entire adult populations of Liverpool, Southampton and Oxford combined, NHS England pointed out.

The Government will be looking to administer an average 2.46 million jabs a week throughout the booster campaign in order to meet its deadline for finishing the rollout.

Ministers are considering giving people a different booster jab to the shot they received for their first and second dose, after early trials suggested that mixing vaccines could provoke an enhanced immune response.  It could mean a significant reduction in the use of AstraZeneca jabs.

Seven jabs are being tested, with the mRNA vaccines Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and subunit protein vaccine Novavax showing positive results in preliminary data, it is understood.

Where in the UK vaccine booster trials will take place and what vaccines are being considered

Details of the booster jab rollout emerged after Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, briefed MPs on it.

On Sunday the Government announced that 85million doses of Covid vaccine had been administered so far, with 88 per cent of adults receiving their first shot and 72 per cent both doses. All adults are due to be offered a second jab by mid-September.

Is the UK on track to hit vaccination targets?
Public Health England data shows that two doses provide over 90 per cent protection against hospitalisation from the delta variant, which is the dominant strain in the UK.

The booster jab campaign aims to protect the most vulnerable ahead of winter from any other variants of concern.

The number of pharmacies involved will triple from around 650, marking a change to the next phase of the vaccination programme.

At the end of June, Matt Hancock, then health secretary, served notice of plans for a ‚Äúbig shift‚Äù towards delivery through pharmacies. He added: ‚ÄúFrankly we need GPs to be back in surgeries practising medicine in the normal way.‚Äù

Nikki Kanani, the NHS England medical director for primary care, last month unveiled a streamlined application process to allow more pharmacies to sign up to hand out the jab.

Sites can now express an interest in administering as few as 100 jabs a week.  Previously they had to be able to commit to giving out 1,000 to be eligible.

There appears to be public demand to get jabs at pharmacies.  A YouGov poll conducted last month for the National Pharmacy Association [NPA] showed that 90 per cent of people would consider getting a Covid-19 booster jab at a pharmacy.

The survey showed that 67 per cent said this would be very convenient, compared with 30 per cent for mass vaccination centres.

The pharmacy industry has welcomed plans to increase the number of sites authorised to carry out Covid jabs.

Pharmacies can take the load off GPs 
Andrew Lane, the NPA chairman, highlighted that involving more pharmacies would allow GPs to focus on clearing the care backlog in the NHS.

He said he had met with Mr Zahawi, who acknowledged that people have a high level of trust in their local pharmacists. In addition, Mr Lane said that pharmacies were present in all communities, including the most deprived areas of the country.

‚ÄúAfter the mass vaccination centres are wound down, pharmacies will still be there for the long haul out of this nightmare,‚Äù he added.

Concerns have arisen in the sector, however, about plans to withdraw state indemnity for pharmacies during the booster campaign, which will raise the cost of their participation as they are forced to seek private insurance.

The plan to cover only GPs under the state-backed scheme during the third phase of the vaccination programme was revealed by Caroline Temmink, the NHS England and NHS Improvement director of primary care vaccination, in a webinar last month, according to the publication Chemist and Druggist.

Simon Dukes, the chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Negotiating Services Committee, which represents high street pharmacies during talks with the Government, called on ministers to reverse the plan.

‚ÄúThe Government should think again about that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt does seem odd that we‚Äôve got indemnity for GP sites and not for pharmacy sites. For something like this, a national effort against a pandemic, we should be doing everything we can.‚Äù

Another senior pharmacy industry source called for more transparency in the relationship between the sector and the health service, saying: ‚ÄúThe NHS has been quite coy about sharing data with us.‚Äù

While up to 2,000 pharmacies will become Covid vaccination centres, the number falls far short of the 9,500 pharmacies that usually offer flu vaccines.

Sector insiders called on ministers to ensure that those chemists that ordered stocks of flu jabs back in March, but are not set to offer Covid jabs, are not left out of pocket if they are shunned by people who prefer to visit a site where they can get both at once, if the ‚Äúone in each arm‚Äù policy is approved.

An NHS spokesman said: ‚ÄúCommunity pharmacies have been an important part of the NHS Covid vaccination programme, the biggest and most successful in the health service‚Äôs history, and they will continue to play a vital role as we move into the next phase this autumn.‚Äù

In 1938, a year before, Western Europe signed the Munich Agreement with Germany with the same goal: to ward off war by any means possible.

You do n't seem to know what the word ""alliance"" means btw. It would be considered an alliance if the USSR entered the ""Tripartite Pact"" and fought on the side of Germany, but they refused to do so.  
In November 1940 Hitler invited the USSR to join this pact. Again. Foreign Minister Molotov flew to Berlin, where he received such an offer. Hitler wanted to put pressure on the USSR, trying to convince the ambassador that Germany had already won the war. At the same time, British aircraft shelled Berlin with bombs, to which Molotov replied: ""If England is defeated, then why are we sitting in this shelter? And whose bombs are falling so close that they can be heard exploding even here?""

I know about the respective carbon intensity, I like to take it from the [source](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/energy-systems/07_figure_7-7/) (I can't wait to see what AR6 will say).    
Also individual carbon intensity is misleading too, as when looking at actual electricity mix it draws a different picture.    
Like [this](https://i.imgur.com/sSTpTud.png), or [this](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcejy.png), or [this](https://imgur.com/a/Zux1FnY).     
So far, seems like trying do with only the ""favorite"" low carbon options can't match what was achieved with betting on the ""other ones"".   

Sure, gas instead of coal is still an improvement, but those -14% only made the task more difficult. Let's see who will pick up the remaining 13% (sadly if it ends up being nat gas, that will not be a good bargain and it will definitely be too late to take it back).    

Also from [UK](http://clivebest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Daily-Peak.png), to [France](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544218304729#fig3), to [Canada](https://nuclear-economics.com/12-nuclear-flexibility/), heck, even [Germany](https://www.tab-beim-bundestag.de/en/pdf/publications/summarys/TAB-Hintergrundpapier-hp021_Z.pdf) there is more flexibility than what is often given credit for.    

For the fun tibbit (framing?), before Fukushima, next gen fuel were being developed to further improve flexibility, because that was what the operators (ie the customer) were looking for, (it is more a safety case demonstration issue than technical), because the issues are the same (basically demonstrate that the fuel remains robust even after a lot of heating-cooling cycles), they spun the marketing and now call them [Accident Tolerant Fuel](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/atf.html).

When exactly there wasn't corruption and nepotism in Polish politics? In what period?

\&gt;&gt;The ruling party didn't give a flying fuck&lt;&lt;

A fundamental difference in comparison with Belarus  is that Poland's ruling party is in power only becasue they won democratic election. So if you don't like PiS ,  just vote against them. You can do it. If enough people will vote on opposition  parties, PiS will lose power. Belarusians can't remove Lukashenko from power by election. If you are unable to see that difference, you are delusional.

\&gt;&gt;People were protesting an abortion ban in tens of thousands&lt;&lt;

Yes, tens of thousands were protesting, but millions voted PiS, who always were clear that are against right to abortion. So idk what exactly is your point.

\&gt;&gt;Our national TV statio  is on North Korea level of propaganda&lt;&lt;

But most private media outlets in Poland also are on this level of propaganda, with this difference, that they are anti-PiS. So I would say we have sort of balance here.",,/r/europe/comments/ovrcxw/belarusian_athlete_in_the_tokyo_olympics_kryscina/h7c4wer/,abdefff,1627840339

4380,"Almost 17 percent. respondents in a survey conducted by SW Research for ""Rzeczpospolita"" assess that Poland should leave the structures of the European Union.
Judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal, which in mid-July decided that the provision of the EU Treaty, on the basis of which the CJEU obliges member states to apply interim measures on. the judiciary, is unconstitutional, has brought back discussions about the possibilities of the so-called. polexitu.

The justification for the Constitutional Tribunal's judgment indicated that the European Union cannot replace Member States in creating regulations regarding the system of courts and guarantees of independence of judges. A few days after the ruling, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki assured that ""there is no risk of polexit, it is a kind of political fantasy."". - There is neither risk nor any such intentions. This is a kind of political emotion that our opponents try to arouse - he argued during a press conference in Miedziana G√≥ra.

But according to some commentators, Poland has never been so close to leaving the Union. ""Not because this is the declared plan of the Polish authorities or because the European headquarters wants it, but because the logic of events on which rational thinking people have less and less influence is increasingly leading in this direction,"" wrote Jƒôdrzej Bielecki in Rzeczpospolita.

Opposition politicians talk about the reality of Poland's exit from the EU. Commenting on the verdict of the Constitutional Tribunal, Tomasz Grodzki, Speaker of the Senate, said that ""signs of preparation for polexit are becoming increasingly clear"". - We have examples of this in relation to what is happening with the Constitutional Tribunal. This game is extremely risky when five judges, including unauthorized judges or doubles, negate what the nation has long decided in a referendum, i.e. that we recognize the European treaties, the Lisbon Treaty, signed by Lech Kaczy≈Ñski. So that taking steps that may ultimately end in our exit from the EU is an extremely dangerous game from which they enjoy east of us. Moreover, the authorities are not entitled to such movements, because the nation clearly stated in the referendum that we want to be members of the family of European nations - said PO politician .

In turn, Donald Tusk, commenting on the ruling, stated that ""It is not Poland, but Kaczy≈Ñski and his party leave the Union."". ""And only we Poles can effectively oppose this,"" he added.

Poles think about Poland's exit from the European Union? We asked about this in a survey conducted by SW Research for Rzeczpospolita.

""Do you think Poland should leave the European Union?""- almost 17% answered the question asked in this way. respondents. The opposite opinion is 62.6 percent. respondents. Slightly more than one-fifth of respondents do not have an opinion on this matter.

- Exit from the structures of the European Union negatively assesses almost 70 percent. respondents over 50. year of life (68%.) and a slightly higher percentage of respondents with higher education (69%.). Leaving the Union is opposed to 7 out of 10 people with income in the range of PLN 2001-3000 and nearly 3 out of 4 city dwellers from 100,000. up to 199 thousand. people. Leaving the Union, ""yes"" says more men (22%. vs. 12 percent. women) and the same percentage (22%.) inhabitants of the smallest cities (up to 20 thousand.) - adds Adam Jastrzƒôbski, Senior Project Manager at SW Research.

The study was conducted by the SW Research research agency among users of the on-line SW Panel panel on 27-28.7.2021. The analysis included a group of 800 Internet users over 18. year of life. The sample was selected in a random-quota manner.

Such an incredibly far fetched idea that it makes me wonder: is that a real possibility or just a secret wish of yours with which you lull yourself at night because you hate Romanians? Rhetorical question, we know the answer.

&gt;Attacking us for an idiot's arguments not hiding that Romanization is a problem now since Ceau≈üescu, also you don't mind that consequences because it's ok in Romania to delete out the Hungarians' presence

So that initial comment of yours was always about Hungarians really, you don't give two shits about Transylvanian Saxons after all. It was just a way to talk indirectly about HunGaRiAn lEgAcY. That obsession must be possessing you day in, day out. 

Also, nobody gives a shit about who was first here in Transylvania. In this day and age, that topic can be relevant only in historians' conversations. It never mattered actually. Even if conclusive evidence is found, whether in Romanians' or Hungarians' favor, it won't change anything in the grand scheme of things. Cause it doesn't matter! Only thing that matters is demographics.

One must be incredibly delusional to occupy his mind with such unimportant things and argue passionately on the internet who was first in some territory and suggest how, who knows, the tables could turn against you in the future. The most irrelevant topic out there.

Also the preposterous accusation that policies of *romanianization* are happening in Romania. If that really was the case, Romania would make the international headlines in an instant and the EU would immediately take notice and reprimand Romania accordingly. We'd be in great trouble.

4886,"Some excerpts from the article which is quite long.

&gt; Index reported a couple of days ago that, according to Avantgarde Public Relations Kft., Transylvanian Hungarians who are RMDSZ voters are ‚Äúthe politically most conservative group‚Äù in the whole of Romania. The firm is not one of the better-known public opinion firms in Hungary, and their methodology strikes me as primitive. Respondents had the choice of defining themselves as either ‚Äúconservative‚Äù or ‚Äúprogressive.‚Äù The survey found that 95% of Rom√°niai Magyar Demokrata Sz√∂vets√©g (RMDSZ) voters are ‚Äúrock solid conservatives.‚Äù But even the majority (68%) of social democratic voters identify themselves as conservative.

&gt; Considering that F≈ët√©r (Main Square), a Fidesz-financed Hungarian-language publication, broke the news about the opinion poll under the headline ‚ÄúRest assured: Hungarians are the most conservative in Romania,‚Äù I think we ought to view the results with a certain level of distrust, especially since F≈ët√©r was so excited about the outcome that it rejoiced over the fact that, according to the poll, RMDSZ voters are more ‚Äúconservative‚Äù than supporters of the Alian»õa pentru Unirea Rom√¢nilor (AUR), the far-right chauvinistic party known for its hatred of Hungarians.

&gt; Avantgarde‚Äôs designation of RMDSZ voters as conservative is correct only if one believes that Viktor Orb√°n is conservative. Because RMDSZ is by now nothing more than the Romanian branch of Fidesz.

&gt; Perhaps even more telling, George Simion, chairman of the anti-Hungarian, far-right AUR, recently gave an interview to Azonnali in which he said that he views Viktor Orb√°n as a model to be followed. In fact, he asserted that he considers himself to be Romania‚Äôs Viktor Orb√°n since ‚Äúwe share the same ideology.‚Äù

&gt; Orb√°n‚Äôs influence in Romania is growing. As Bor√≥ka Par√°szka, a Hungarian journalist from Transylvania, noted, ‚ÄúOrb√°n has become either a bogeyman or a savior, but in any case, a key player in Romanian political life in recent weeks.‚Äù

&gt; RMDSZ can now promote its ideas through a new media empire financed by the Orb√°n government. It has a whole gallery of servile publications in which Fidesz-critical pieces cannot appear. RMDSZ goes to great lengths to minimize the influence of the few independent organs still in existence in the Hungarian-language press in Romania.

&gt; The Transylvanian KESMA (Central European Press and Media Foundation) is known as Erd√©lyi M√©diat√©r Egyes√ºlet/Alian»õa pentru Spa»õiul Media Transilvania (Association of Transylvanian Media). In the past three and a half years the Orb√°n government has poured more than ‚Ç¨20 million into it. This is an enormous amount of money. The Romanian government‚Äôs annual expenditure on the Hungarian minority is ‚Ç¨5-6 million. According to Zolt√°n Sipos, editor of √Åtl√°tsz√≥ in Romania, the association‚Äôs budget in 2020 was around 18.2 million lei or 3.6 million euros. Many local print publications, such as Kr√≥nika, V√°s√°rhelyi H√≠rlap, Cs√≠ki H√≠rlap, and Gyergy√≥i H√≠rlap, were rescued by money coming from Hungary.

&gt; On the legislative front, some Hungarian politicians in Transylvania find the Orb√°n government‚Äôs discriminatory anti-LGBTQ law quite attractive. In response to Orb√°n‚Äôs call for a referendum on his government‚Äôs so-called anti-pedophilia law, RMDSZ‚Äôs spokeswoman told N√©pszava that the party ‚Äúnaturally supports the participation of those Hungarians in Transylvania who have dual citizenship in the referendum.‚Äù

&gt; Moreover, Istv√°n Csomort√°nyi, chairman of the Erd√©lyi Magyar N√©pp√°rt (EMN)/Hungarian People‚Äôs Party of Transylvania, a creation of L√°szl√≥ T≈ëk√©s, indicated that the party would submit through an RMDSZ member of parliament a proposal to the Romanian parliament to adopt a bill similar to the Hungarian anti-pedophilia law. Csomort√°nyi, by the way, was fined 5,000 lei (c. 350,000 forints) in 2019 by the National Council for Anti-Discrimination in Romania after a photo of him with a Heil Hitler sign appeared on Facebook.

The Netherlands legalized same-sex marriage in 2001, being the first county in the world to do so. At that time, Sweden was ruled by a left-wing government. It refused to follow.

It wasn't until a right-wing coalition won in the election in 2006 that Sweden could legalize same-sex marriage, which finally happened in 2009.

Being right-wing doesn't necessarily mean being conservative. During this time, the right-wing was arguably more progressive than the left-wing in Sweden (the Socialdemocrats are quite morally conservative).

Now, with the entrance of the Swedendemocrats, some of the former right-wing parties have adjusted their policies to SD to be able to build a coalition.

Unfortunately, this means that a government has to include either S or SD, and that's why very little progressive reforms have happened in Sweden in this decade. Things like euthanasia and unlicensed dancing are still taboo, and there's nothing the voters can do about it.

I don't want to reach any conclusion it would be pointless with you, but I'm enjoying the discussion.

&gt; There are region of French Alps with no coverage and you're sent to the Italian provider. Does that make this region of Alp Italian?

No, because that is a limit condition. In some touristic establishment in French Polynesia they accept US dollars, but that means nothing. The official currency is the CFP. As the official mobile providers in France (the ones regulated by ARECP and that have been assigned the frequencies) are the likes of Orange, Free, SFR etc. It is very simple to understand.

5001,"&gt; if you didn't like it you could go whistle because Stobarts would come in and do it. 

So, the thing is that this pricing structure is inefficient.  Like, all else held equal ‚Äî and maybe Stobarts is more efficient in some other way, like recruiting inexpensive immigrant labor or something, and that would make it viable ‚Äî I'd assume that a competitor could offer a slightly lower rate on distance (or fixed cost per delivery, or whatever other fees there are) in exchange for getting the customer to pay demurrage fees, and that both the customer and trucking company could come out ahead.

*considers*

Though that wouldn't be a win for drivers, I think, unless it pulled traffic to trucking and off alternate forms of transit, unless the [price elasticity of demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand) for trucking services is high.  As it is, the structure is basically paying drivers to just sit around, so it's effectively artificially increasing demand for driver labor, which will have some upwards pressure on wages.

&gt; Companies like Stobarts also ran warehouses. So what they'd do is store your goods and wouldn't actually charge for transporting the goods, what they'd do instead is charge a handling charge per pallet and an amount for storage, collecting it and delivering it for free.

So, if Stobarts had a horizontal monopoly in warehousing, had some way to keep competitors from entering the warehousing space, I could see that.  But otherwise, I don't see how it could work, because otherwise a competitor can enter the warehousing space, use a different pricing model (e.g. instead of five pounds, charge four  pounds for storage, but also charge demurrage, with an overall lower cost to the customer) and undercut Stobarts and take their marketshare.

Are they dominant in warehousing or something, like pretty much everyone has to use 'em on that end of things?",üá∫üá∏ üçî United States of America üçî üá∫üá∏,/r/europe/comments/ovgfsx/retailers_blame_brexit_for_widespread_food/h79z7u9/,duisThias,1627789695

If the German Government had failed to guard against this peril, they would have compromised the safety and the very existence of Germany.  
&gt;  
&gt;The German Government were, therefore, obliged to make representations to the Government of His Majesty the Emperor of All the Russias and to insist upon a cessation of the aforesaid military acts.

5054,"Warsaw Uprising, (August-October 1944) was an insurrection in Warsaw during World War II by which Poles unsuccessfully tried to oust the German army and seize control of the city before it was occupied by the advancing Soviet army. The uprising‚Äôs failure allowed the pro-Soviet Polish administration, rather than the Polish government-in-exile in London, to gain control of Poland.

As the Red Army approached Warsaw (29‚Äì30 July 1944), Soviet authorities, promising aid, encouraged the Polish underground there to stage an uprising against the Germans. However, the Polish underground, known as the Home Army, was anxious because the Soviet Union had already assumed direct control of eastern Poland and had sponsored the formation of the Polish Committee of National Liberation to administer the remainder of Soviet-occupied Polish territory. 

Hoping to gain control of Warsaw before the Red Army could ‚Äúliberate‚Äù it, the Home Army followed the Soviet suggestion to revolt.

Commanded by General Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski, the Warsaw corps of 50,000 troops attacked the relatively weak German force on August 1 and within three days gained control of most of the city. The Germans sent in reinforcements, however, and forced the Poles into a defensive position, bombarding them with air and artillery attacks for the next 63 days.  
  
Meanwhile, the Red Army, which had been detained during the first days of the insurrection by a German assault, occupied a position at Praga, a suburb across the Vistula River from Warsaw, and remained idle. In addition, the Soviet government refused to allow the western Allies to use Soviet air bases to airlift supplies to the beleaguered Poles.

Without Allied support, the Home Army split into small, disconnected units and was forced to surrender when its supplies gave out (October 2). B√≥r-Komorowski and his forces were taken prisoner, and the Germans then systematically deported the remainder of the city‚Äôs population and destroyed the city itself.  
  
By allowing the Germans to suppress the Warsaw Uprising, the Soviet authorities also allowed them to eliminate the main body of the military organization that supported the Polish government-in-exile in London. Consequently, when the Soviet army occupied all of Poland, there was little effective organized resistance to its establishing Soviet political domination over the country and imposing the communist-led Provisional Government of Poland in January 1945.

5105,"&gt;Well of course you wouldn't rule out J&amp;J because it's not a count of second doses administered, it's a count of all doses administere which, in the case of J&amp;J, only involves one dose. And to your point about vaccine effectiveness against delta, that's not something that can be guaged through a measure about percentage of people vaccinated because that's not what this is measuring. 

Well I think like the UK's decision to use non-recommeded dosing schedules without the requisite data at the time, treating J&amp;J as fully-vaccinated with one dose risks set backs if it's shown to not be efficacious enough against Delta. 

&gt; But even if we were talking about that, the vast vast majority of people vaccinated in Ireland have been vaccinated with Pfizer which according to the source in your link is the most effective vaccine against delta. While this is true for Ireland, I'm of the impression that this does not stand true for the UK.

Absolutely, but thankfully the gap between Pfizer &amp; AZ does not constitute a considerable risk to those vaccinated, and shortens over time, but it remains to be seen with J&amp;J. Fingers crossed - the data from Israel showing Pfizer waning within 6 months is enough on our collective plate to worry about.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ovb1r6/ireland_has_overtaken_the_uk_in_fully_vaccinating/h79n7jd/,belieeeve,1627782621

&gt;The U.S.S.R. was Kendall‚Äôs land of opportunity, and his goal was to open it to Pepsi. In 1972, he succeeded, negotiating a cola monopoly and locking out Coca-Cola until 1985. Cola syrup began flowing through the Soviet Union, where it was bottled locally. It was a coup: As the New York Times put it, the soda was ‚Äúthe first capitalistic product‚Äù available in the U.S.S.R. Pepsi had become a pioneer. But there was one issue: money.
&gt;
&gt;Soviet rubles were worthless internationally, with their value determined by the Kremlin. Soviet law also prohibited taking the currency abroad. So the U.S.S.R. and Pepsi resorted to barter. In return for cola, Pepsi received Stolichnaya vodka to distribute in the United States. By the late 1980s, Russians were drinking approximately a billion servings of Pepsi a year. In 1988, Pepsi broadcast the first paid commercials on local TV, starring none other than Michael Jackson. The bartering worked well‚ÄîStolichnaya was popular in the United States. An American boycott in response to the Soviet-Afghan war, however, meant that Pepsi wanted something else to trade.
&gt;
&gt;So, in the spring of 1989, Pepsi and the Soviet Union signed a remarkable deal. Pepsi became the middleman for 17 old submarines and three warships, including a frigate, a cruiser, and a destroyer, which the company sold for scrap. Pepsi also bought new Soviet oil tankers and leased them out or sold them in partnership with a Norwegian company. In return, the company could more than double the number of Pepsi plants in the Soviet Union.",üá∫üá∏ üçî United States of America üçî üá∫üá∏,/r/europe/comments/ov9qwn/moscow_during_the_august_1991_coup_d√©tat_attempt/h79qqpi/,duisThias,1627784632
5141,"No. Whilst demurrage is a thing and I remember hauliers charging it when I first started in the 1990s it was one of those things that died the death as competition increased and there was a race to the bottom when companies like Eddie Stobarts came in doing the jobs for less than cost to get the work. As a result haulage companies didn't charge it for fear of losing the contract. 

Tesco have started to pay it recently because they realised that they were one of the worst companies for keeping suppliers lorries waiting due to the fact they abused them for free warehousing - after all it's much cheaper to use a suppliers lorry for free than to build more warehouse space which costs money to build, run and staff - and that they were starting to be blacklisted too.

Amazon is also on the radar of haulage companies. One guy on a trucking forum recently wrote how he was waiting 6hrs to unload a few pallets. That's not 6hrs to get unloaded, that was 3hrs waiting to get on a bay then once on a bay 3hrs before the first one came off. 

Under our driving hours rules we're limited to a 13hr working day so you can imagine how much of an impact it has on the earnings of a vehicle if it's spending a third to a half of it's day waiting at a delivery to get unloaded. The worst part about it all is that much of the so called shortage is actually ones that these companies have created themselves mostly down to this by wasting the time. If you got unloaded within even 2hrs of turning up to your booking you could do two deliveries a day instead of one. Just by doing that and improving the productivity of the haulage side you cut the amount of lorries and drivers needed significantly.",England,/r/europe/comments/ovgfsx/retailers_blame_brexit_for_widespread_food/h79qr0g/,MinuteNoodles,1627784637

Hmm.  I'll buy that some concession needed to be made, but it seems like the wait time issue could have been predicted.  I mean, it makes the wait losses to the haulage company an externality from the customer's standpoint in planning how many unloading people to hire, so it makes the customer make inefficient decisions.

And then the haulage companies have to eat losses from that and make good on their losses by charging higher-than-ideal rates on other things (I assume on distance).  That's gonna make the customer inefficiently-favor reducing miles moved too.  I mean, both parties wind up worse off than need be.

Oh no mate, I don't think you realise just how fucked up haulage ended up in the UK over the last 20 years thanks to companies like Stobarts. Until literally this year the customer dictated the rate. It's one of the reasons that we ended up with so many Eastern European drivers because the only thing haulage bosses had any control over was driver's wages and to someone from say Romania the UK minimum wage for a week was more than double the average weekly wage for that country.

5239,"&gt;My point during this was to state that, given this is an article about Ireland passing the UK on 2nd doses but not yet 1st, the fact that they didn't rule out the single-dose jab J&amp;J and lengthened the doses like the UK did, is evidently enough explanation. I had yet to see any conclusive data on J&amp;J to know either way and what I've just read seems far from conclusive. If Ireland are right that J&amp;J remain efficacious their vaccine schedule has clearly surpassed the UK's

Well of course you wouldn't rule out J&amp;J because it's not a count of second doses administered, it's a count of all doses administere which, in the case of J&amp;J, only involves one dose. And to your point about vaccine effectiveness against delta, that's not something that can be guaged through a measure about percentage of people vaccinated because that's not what this is measuring. But even if we were talking about that, the vast vast majority of people vaccinated in Ireland have been vaccinated with Pfizer which according to the source in your link is the most effective vaccine against delta.

5401,"&gt;The irish breakfast roll is a feat of culinary engineering. Take a baguette, slice lengthways and butter it. Add a sausage, two fried eggs, two rashers of bacon, hash browns and some black or white pudding, cover in ketchup, then serve. At around 1,300 calories, it is nearly half the recommended daily allowance for a man, and is traditionally consumed while hungover.  
It has a curious hold on the Irish psyche. A homage to the ‚ÄúJumbo Breakfast Roll‚Äù was the best-selling song in 2006, beating Shakira‚Äôs ‚ÄúHips Don‚Äôt Lie‚Äù. One academic produced a sociological study: ‚ÄúThe Rise and Fall of the Jumbo Breakfast Roll: How a Sandwich Survived the Decline of the Irish Economy‚Äù. But it was in politics that the breakfast roll truly dominated.  
Breakfast Roll Man was a symbol of the Celtic Tiger. A hungover construction worker gorging on one after a big night out was a common sight in the boom years. These were the cash-rich workers, argued David McWilliams, an Irish commentator who devised the term, who came out and guaranteed a victory for Bertie Ahern in 2007 just before the Irish economy came crashing down.  
Every European country has its Breakfast Roll Man, a proverbial voter who sums up the political zeitgeist. For decades the housewife of Voghera, a town in Lombardy, has been a shorthand for middle-of-the-road voters in Italy. In Denmark it is Mr and Mrs Kakkelbord, named after the ubiquitous coffee tables found in Danish suburbia. The couple emerged after a politician unintentionally insulted the furniture choice of the common voter. From the Swabian housewife, an image favoured by Angela Merkel in her austerity days, to the Mondeo Man of Tony Blair‚Äôs era, each proverb is revealing in its own way.  
Sometimes proverbial voters are used as a political weapon, rather than a tool of analysis. Populists use figurative voters to frame their base as the true voice of the nation. In the Netherlands an imaginary couple called Henk and Ingrid dominate. Invented by Geert Wilders, the bleached-blond anti-immigration politician, they are the ordinary supporters of the Party for Freedom (pvv). Alexander Pechtold, then the leader of the liberal d66, even wrote a book‚Äî‚ÄúHenk, Ingrid and Alexander‚Äù‚Äîarguing with the imaginary couple. During the pandemic, Mr Wilders blamed ‚ÄúMohammed and Fatima‚Äù, the immigrant antithesis of Henk and Ingrid, for blocking beds in hospitals from the native Dutch. It sparked another round of discourse on Mr Wilders‚Äôs terms.  
Repeating a rival‚Äôs framework only helps the rival, argues Tom van der Meer, a professor at the University of Amsterdam. Mr Wilders wields influence in Dutch politics by an ability to drag parties towards his more radical positions. Although his party is usually the second or third-largest in the Netherlands, there is little chance of his entering government. Bluntly, there are not enough Henks or Ingrids to put him there. Yet so long as Henk and Ingrid loom over the debate as the archetypal voter, politicians end up spreading Mr Wilders‚Äôs message.  
Where life is good, so is the life of the proverbial voter. Complaining about life in Scandinavia, one of the richest regions on the planet, is the equivalent of moaning about having stubbed a toe while celebrating a lottery win. Where Henk and Ingrid struggle along, proverbial voters in Scandinavia are content. In Sweden, politicians speak of Medelsvennsons, who are concerned with ‚Äúvilla, Volvo, vovve‚Äù (house, Volvo, dog). If those categories are fulfilled, then they are happy. Things for ‚ÄúBla Bjarne‚Äù‚Äîa well-paid, middle-aged, Danish craftsman‚Äîare rather good. So good, in fact, that he can be tempted to the right by the promise of tax cuts.  
Where life is worse, so is the life of the proverbial voter. Janusz and Grazyna, an imagined Polish couple from the country‚Äôs provincial hinterland, offer the cruellest example. Janusz is a middle-aged man who drinks to excess, watches too much television, wears socks with sandals and has a moustache. Online, he is often depicted as a proboscis monkey. His wife, Grazyna, is dim, enjoys gossip and shopping. Their son, Sebastian, is a ne‚Äôer-do-well.  
If the stereotype is nasty, it is a reflection of Poland‚Äôs brutal politics. The country is the sharpest example of the most important schism in European politics: the increasing gap between the centre and the periphery. Poland‚Äôs liberal cities bristle under the government of the staunchly conservative Law and Justice party (pis), who rely on the likes of Janusz and Grazyna for support. In turn, pis loyalists suggest that city dwellers look down on them. Given the portrait of Janusz and Grazyna, this is fair enough.  
Charging at windmills  
A problem with imaginary voters is that they are imaginary. Social democrats are panicking about plunging vote shares across Europe. But their imagined target voter is outdated, says Tarik Abou-Chadi of the University of Zurich. Rather than engage with the potential voters who actually exist they pitch themselves towards voters who have disappeared, conjuring images of manly miners whom they must win back. This has turned some politicians into political Don Quixotes, charging towards voters that, like the Spaniard‚Äôs windmills, are not at all as expected.  
Proverbial voters can blur political reality as often as reveal it. On the left, the same proverbial voter pops up repeatedly: male, middle-aged and a manufacturer. Young people in dead-end call-centre jobs are rarely represented. The Swabian housewife may be the epitome of Christian Democratic values in the eyes of Angela Merkel. But the party should also focus on those second- and third-generation Turkish-German voters tempted to the centre-right. Yet when it comes to proverbial voters, these groups are invisible. Even when the proverbial voter rings true, politicians must remember to move on. Breakfast Roll Man has had his day. He probably moved to America after the crash, suggests Mr McWilliams. A new voter, hopefully with a better diet, will take his place.

5429,"I agree with you in some parts but there things that I am not like-minded.

  
Perhaps nationalism is one of the oldest human behaviour and ideology from our human ancestors‚Äô legacy. It began with families (including your all relatives) tribal societies, city states and finally to the modern nations. I am not always against the ideology of nationalism. According to historical events, nationalism, sometimes with religion was used for salvation, for independence, for evolution. While, with the high doses, it leads to ethnical wars, genocides, invasions and conquers. You may add many things there. You can minimize the ideology of nationalism, but for me, you can never exterminate that. If you want to do this, first you need to create a system based on world citizenship, then make a solid historical revisionism without mentioning any ethnicity and nation. In short, you need to clear ‚Äúnation‚Äù element.

  
The another thing is, which I find it very harmful, making the history a tool for feeding various ideologies. History, as a proper area for study of past, has become a basis for nationalism and racism. You gave some examples regarding to disputed issues and what I see there, you gave personal opinions from Turkish side above while others gave their popular opinions. This is NOT history. History needs evidences for arguments not personal feelings WITHOUT an evidence. People love to promote their past while they keep the debate regarding to their old rivalries, wars and other historical events. For your comment, our subject is Turkey and its past.

The US makes it seem less like about athlete‚Äôs individual accomplishments and more of you‚Äôre fighting for the US and all of its citizens so don‚Äôt mess up.

Great example is Simone Biles dropping out of the all around and US citizens and some media outlets call her a disgrace and act like they, and the US, are entitled to her athleticism. It‚Äôs less about the athletes and their achievements and more about what they can do for the US. It‚Äôs especially weird to me when people with no athletic ability sit around drinking their beer pissed off because an athlete for the US didn‚Äôt reach their expectations.

Another example is there was a US swimmer who got silver in an event. The post swim interview question was along the lines of ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm the race did you realize you lost.‚Äù This man is the second best swimmer in that event in the world and the interview questions made it seem like he was a loser.

Just my thoughts though. I enjoy watching the Olympics.

In terms of the modern day, it's very complicated. Many Taiwanese people see themselves as an independent Taiwanese nation with a unique Taiwanese culture. Yet many others still see themselves as Chinese and Taiwan as part of China. It's a very complex political issue in Taiwan which has not been resolved. Many people assume that just because the DPP is (and has been) in power in Taiwan means that they have declared independence already, but that is not the case. The current DPP government has actually moderated their stance quite a bit, to the point that many Taiwanese say their stance is indistinguishable from the KMTs stance 2 decades ago (which is to say, acting as an independent nation, while not declaring independence, and trying to keep relatively positive relations with the mainland).

5770,"&gt;TOKYO ‚Äî When working at a venue like the Tokyo Aquatics Centre, one is occasionally required to stop what they are doing and stand up for a national anthem. The medal ceremonies are held in between races, so sometimes you can be furiously jotting away on deadline and then, whoops, time for God Save the Queen.  
  
On Friday this happened while I was writing about Penny Oleksiak‚Äôs tough fourth-place finish in the 100-metre freestyle. All of a sudden the announcer was welcoming Evgeny Rylov to the top of the podium. But instead of the Russian national anthem, they play a Tchaikovsky composition. Do you still have to stand up for a little Tchaikovsky number?  
I did not, and kept writing. And that‚Äôs pretty much it for the practical effects of the International Olympic Committee‚Äôs doping punishment against Russia for these Olympics: Writers can stay seated without offending anyone.  
In every other respect, the Russians competing in Tokyo look entirely like a Russian Olympic team. They wear red, white and blue outfits, and they are announced as representing the Russian Olympic Committee, a meaningless distinction that the IOC seems to think bothers the Russians. The ban on Russia, such as it is, amounts to semantics. For the third straight Games the Russians are here and competing and winning medals and receiving congratulatory phone calls from Vlad Putin, despite having engineered the biggest doping program since the Cold War.  
And they also, frankly, get a little shirty when anyone brings that last part up. Great job, IOC.  
A reporter asked Russian tennis star Daniil Medvedev this week if the drug scandal ‚Äî where Russia effectively turned its entire anti-doping apparatus into a doping apparatus to ensure strong performances at Sochi 2014, where it topped the medal table ‚Äî had put a stigma on the entire Russian team.  
Medvedev, who is a bit of a hothead and, at these Olympics, a literal one, unloaded on the reporter, saying that he should have his credential pulled, be banned from ever covering tennis, and that he never wanted to see his face again. He also didn‚Äôt answer the question.  
American swimmer Ryan Murphy, who won the bronze medal in a race on Friday behind Rylov and another Russian, was asked whether he thought that country had been sufficiently penalized for the doping scandal, and said it was too mentally draining to think about. He said he was swimming in a race that was ‚Äúprobably not clean,‚Äù but later said he was not specifically referring to the two Russians who beat him to the wall.  
The Russian Olympic Committee quickly fired off a cryptic statement that criticized ‚ÄúEnglish-language propaganda‚Äù spread by poor losers.  
‚ÄúYou need to be able to lose,‚Äù said the statement on social media. ‚ÄúNot everyone has that gift.‚Äù  
The idea that Russia is a victim of a Western plot has been part of that country‚Äôs standard response since the allegations of the scheme for Sochi were first aired in a German television documentary in 2014. First, they said, the whole thing was made up and fuelled by liars who had fallen out with Team Russia. Investigations were stonewalled, but further evidence of the program was uncovered, at which point the Russians turned on a doctor-turned-whistleblower and branded him a crazed fabulist. Yet more corroborating evidence was uncovered by multiple World Anti-Doping Agency probes ‚Äî thousands of documents and spreadsheets ‚Äî and the Russians admitted that OK, fine, something untoward happened but it was in fact the whistleblower who was behind it. Oh, and a couple of key Russian officials who would have been in the position to know things ended up dead.  
At every turn, over many years now, the Russians have either refused to cooperate with various investigators or agreed to help and then stalled the release of evidence or manipulated it before they handed it over.  And their athletes keep competing and winning medals ‚Äî 34 so far in Tokyo, as of Saturday.  
The problem from the outset of this whole mess is that anti-doping measures are designed to deal with specific cases at a granular level. Athlete submits urine samples, and they are tested. If positive for a banned substance, a backup sample is tested. Positive again, and punishment is levied. There are also many rules to cover out-of-competition testing, to ensure athletes cannot do all their doping in between events. American sprinter Christian Coleman, the reigning world champion, isn‚Äôt in Tokyo because he missed too many of those tests ‚Äî he insists he is clean, and that he was available to be tested for the last miss, which ultimately brought a suspension. But the rules are unforgiving for a reason: the liability is on the athlete so that officials aren‚Äôt constantly dealing with excuses for this positive result or that missed test.  
The sneaky genius of the Russian plan was that the whole system was engineered to enable doping and protect the drug-takers. Samples were tampered with or replaced altogether, and positive results were switched to negative in the anti-doping system. When the Russian fox was in the doping-control hen house, nothing it produced could be taken at face value, so the search for the usual evidence to prove a positive result was pointless. There were undoubtedly many Russian athletes from that era who were clean, but the only appropriate punishment for a doping scandal of that scope was some kind of outright ban for the entire team.  
Instead, the authorities, the IOC and ultimately WADA, tried to apply the usual rules to a country that had incinerated the rulebook. Was this about fairness, or was it about not treating too harshly a nation that is a valued Olympic partner? If you have to think for long about that question, you must be unfamiliar with the IOC.  
Putin, the guy who keeps finding new and different ways to extend his time at the head of the country, called the Russian gymnasts the other day to commend them for their victory in an ‚Äúhonest and uncompromising fight‚Äù over their more famous U.S. rivals.

5773,"I will give you that technically you were right, but there are two important factors that you are ignoring:

1. The vaccine failed the trials.
1. The side effect was probably happening immediately, but the effects weren't felt until much later, because HIV is so slow.

It is officially accepted that vaccines can have side effects that last for years, but not that they first show up after years. This is a special case because it's hard to test how the immune system reacts to HIV without actively infecting people.

In the context of Coronavirus vaccines, this doesn't apply, since we already know that they boost the immune system against this virus, not weaken it. Even if they would weaken the immune system after a few years (which sounds highly unlikely to me, but I'm not a medical expert so I can't speak with authority), it would still be beneficial to take it for the pandemic we have right now.

Even if the vaccine would weaken the immune system, we would know within a few weeks, because the test participants are exposed to it so much.

5784,"A peak much tougher to climb than Everest.

The first attempt to reach the summit was made by an Anglo-Swiss expedition in 1902 that ascended to 5,670 metres on the peak‚Äôs northeastern crest. Other unsuccessful attempts included an Italian expedition in 1909, led by Luigi Amedeo, duke d‚ÄôAbruzzi, via the southeastern ridge (later called the Abruzzi Ridge) that reached approximately 6,100 metres.

In 1938 an American expedition led by Charles Houston via the Abruzzi Ridge reached about 7,925 metres; in 1939 another American-led expedition following the same route reached about 8,380 metres; and in 1953 another expedition led by Houston reached 7,900 metres on the Abruzzi Ridge. 

Finally, in 1954, an [Italian expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Italian_Karakoram_expedition_to_K2) consisting of five scientists (including the geologist Ardito Desio as leader), a doctor, a photographer, and 12 others, including a Pakistani, managed to conquer the Abruzzi Ridge despite the severe weather conditions. 

The summit was reached at 6 PM on July 31, 1954, by Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli. In the course of the ascent, Mario Puchoz, one of the guides, died of pneumonia.  


Because K2 is prone to frequent and severe storms that make the already treacherous climbing conditions on its slopes even more challenging‚Äîand humans find functioning at such high elevations difficult‚Äîit is one of the world‚Äôs most difficult mountains to climb. 

The number of people to have reached the top constitutes only a small fraction compared with how many have successfully climbed Mount Everest. I

\&gt;Romanians didn't build those houses,   
I dont remember that one of the requirments to be a builder was ""not being a romanian"", do you stil think that medieval world was a small isolated one, where different groups of ppl didnt interact with each other?  
In the 14th century Sighisoara secured its designation as a free city, enabling it to become an important centre of trade, trade attracts ppl, being Transylvania these ppl were of different ethnic groups. The saxons were practical ppl, they fostered and supported a lot of wallachian and moldavian noblemans in exchange for different if it were for them to get the thone of Wallachia and Moldavia favours. Beside them  individuals such as Vlad the second lived in the city and hold some sort of authority there. Long after his death his son raided the saxon citties for fostering his rivals, this continued to be a common occuerence.   
Romanians had a considerable in the saxon citties of Transylvania they were present in all the social classes, the fact that you dont like this is another story  
A Transylvanian Saxon intellectual (and Lutheran pastor) from 1800‚Äôs Transylvania named Stephan Ludwig Roth, pointed out something interesting in his book The Battle of Languages in Transylvania Der Sprachkampf in Siebenburgen (1842):  
  
""The gentlemen from the Diet in Klausenburg may have given birth to an official language, and now they rejoice, that the child was born\[...\] However we have already a language of the land. It is not German, also not the Hungarian language, but the Wallachian language! We may take measures and threaten as we like, that is the way it is, and not otherwise.  
  
When two people of different nationalities, who cannot speak each other's language, meet, is the Wallachian language that serves as translator. No matter if one travels or goes to the market, anyone can speak Wallachian. Before one tries to see whether that one can speak German or that one can speak Hungarian, the discussion starts in Wallachian.""  
  
  
  
  
\&gt;all the Romanians ever did was maintenance and a lot of times a poor job at that.  
Well given the fact that majority of these buildings still exist today means we did a pretty good job.  
Also the fact that you claim that romanians were mainly doing maintenance job confirms that romanians were part of the majority of the sectors of economy, if romanians work to maintain different parts of the city it means that they took part in the building process of many more structures

5882,"&gt;For example every time there's a police chase video in reddit, Americans are cheering for cops to shoot the subjects or are hell-bent to justify it. 

I don't usually see this ever lol, wtf are you talking about? Other than maybe a few trolls usually people don't want someone to get shot just for running from police. I mean getting tackled or pitted or something might be celebrated sometimes but Americans, like any other group of people, are not bloodthirsty barbarians like you seem to think

&gt;This is true on every robbery gone wrong video also where the comment section is cheering for robber to get shot.

Uh yeah, because if you threaten to kill people at gunpoint with the purpose of petty theft you deserve to get shot. Someone who shoots a person who is an active threat to the lives of multiple people including themselves is a hero and should be celebrated. Is it any different in Finland? Do people support violent criminals over there? Are they sad when someone successfully acts to protect others and themselves?

&gt;It's like every American is looking for justification to shoot or use violence 

Lol what? That's just blatantly false lol.

&gt;not if they should shoot

I am really curious where you got the idea that we are always itching to shoot or hurt someone, Americans, like anyone else, don't tend to enjoy senseless killing or violence, however sometimes violence is necessary, for example when someone is threatening your life or the lives of others.

&gt;and especially if the other person is criminal

Are you implying that killing innocent people is in any way culturally or legally acceptable? Because no, it is absolutely not. Also yeah if someone is mid violent crime then their life holds little to no value. If you or someone else is having their life threatened there is no moral issue with them inflicting injury or death upon the person who is threatening them.

&gt;The whole idea of using guns mostly as a self defence out of irrational fears

It's really not an irrational fear at all, violent crime happens all the time and guns are proven to be massively effective for self defense. Having a gun for self defense is no less irrational than carrying pepper spray or wearing a seat belt. It's a basic safety precaution. 

&gt;when it seems to just kill fellow Americans and make their homes less safe.

The vast majority of the time in the US guns are used in self defense. 

&gt;Guns are like a emotional support blanket, which would be fine if they weren't lethal.

You're smearing national heroes of a nation because you can't admit you were wrong for one instance, sick. And yes the genocide was the intention, literally one of the main goals of the coup was to raze the Mayans to the ground, they did not hide that fact for a second.

 To actually say that a genocide benefitted the world, seriously Nazi level stuff here mate, regardless of whatever you want to deny yourself, the coup was responsible for the genocide, it resulted in 30 years of war, genocide and dictatorship, to a country that was in no way shape or form affiliated with any enemy of the united states. what an absolute win for the democratic world. 

It benefitted no one, hence the 30 year civil war that followed, hence the fact that the men are hailed as national heroes, hence the fact that the CIA themselves declassified the failures of the operation, but yeah, your lies, that you alone believe, not America, not Britain, not France, not the CIA, or any of the intelligence services of these nations but you alone, 

Bravo, maybe you should join the CIA since you apparently found out facts for these men being affiliated with the USSR that no intelligence service could ever find, seriously, its been declassified, absolutely nothing, would love to hear your decades of investigative work that proved the CIA wrong about their own coup.",,/r/europe/comments/ooc3a4/evolution_soviet_antinuclear_warfare_poster/h76rcyz/,SJDany,1627725674
