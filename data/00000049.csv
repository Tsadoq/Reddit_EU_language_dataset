1,"I don't particularly appreciate your ""them vs. us"" attitude, ""your mess"" somehow implies I was somehow personally responsible for this shit show. I find it funny the amount hate directed at the country particularly when Wales/Scotland/Ireland have plenty of their own fuckups.

Politics has been a total disaster for decades as it's pretty much corrupt through to the core, intended to manipulate the populous skewing the power towards the Rich. Just go see how they teach in the likes of Eton vs. a public comprehensive - it's vastly different and intentionally so.

I don't forgive racism, yet look how the media and political parties sow dissent at more accessible targets rather than the white collar corruption. It's a lot easier to go ""immigrants are stealing our jobs, and living off benefits"", than to dig through panama papers to see how public and private money is funnelled away from the poor through various dubious schemes. 

Cambridge analytica and the abuse of facebook not to mention the systemic use of poisonous 'faux news'  which third party actors have used.

With regards to the legal frameworks on human rights, yeah that's terrible - and you can extend that to the fact the tories do not want to compete on mutually improving regulatory standards across the board.

What we, and just about every other country is lacking is a political party that actually serves the people - but the powers that be will never let that happen.

None of the above is isolated to the UK, it's all over the world. Look throughout Europe for the various riots, isolationism, rise in xenophobia - the UK or should I say England, are just being used as the scapegoat",,/r/europe/comments/kidfxp/this_is_not_the_queue_for_the_dover_ferry_this_is/ggsa2er/,HettySwollocks,1608718056

11,"Sigh. The UK does want zero tariff and zero quota access to the EU single market. This is common knowledge. The fact that you don't know this after four and a half years is staggeringly ignorant. You could have confirmed it for yourself [if you had done 5 seconds of googling](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/01/brexit-what-are-the-key-flashpoints-as-eu-uk-trade-talks-begin). Boris Johnson himself said [that the UK would retain access to the single market back in 2016](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-boris-idUKKCN0ZC13W), clearly indicating a preference. He still wants it [in 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/51180282).

&gt; Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants a zero-tariff, zero-quota deal, but also insists on the UK's right to diverge, or move away from, EU rules and regulations.

This is why the EU insist that the UK agree to the level playing field and governance. Both of which are far more important than fishing and both of which the UK refuse because the UK intend to undercut the single market.

27,"&gt; He is Zaza not Kurdish

That is like saying [Irwin who speaks a Yorkshire variety of English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScELaXMCVis) isn't English (watch the video in full, for the majority of the video, he is speaking regular English for the camera). Zazaki (also known as Kirmanckî, Kirdkî and Dimlî) is closely related to Kurmancî, I mean they are so similiar that Kurmancî speakers understand what is being said.

Besides that point, Zazas are Kurds if they consider themselves Kurds, wouldn't you agree? Most Zaza I've met do so.

One popular song played by my Zaza speaking friends is [Koyê Dêrsim war êmawo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpX7UWZ35Wg), the lyrics go something like:

&gt; The mountains of Dêrsim are our existence
&gt; Kurdistan is our homeland
&gt; This land is like paradise
&gt; Today it is divided

Now don't get me wrong. If a Zaza considers himself/herself to be not Kurdish, then who am I to pass judgement! The relationship between language and ethnicity is very complicated. Ethnicity is not only based on language, but also on culture, religion, shared history, origin, social behaviour, social factors, etc.

People should be free to identify as whatever they want, they should be free to speak whatever language they want, and express and practice their culture in the way they want. ♥",,/r/europe/comments/kiped2/human_rights_court_orders_turkey_to_free_kurdish/ggsa9q0/,Ciwan1859,1608718286

I don´t mean it is the same as Russian food, but the feeling is similar: It is okay, tasty, but not special.  

It is, in my opinion, better than the food culture of the UK.

355,"Again I'm speaking as a non-expert.

As far as I can tell, the consequences of Brexit were very much speculation. Those who wished to leave claimed it would allow the UK to better leverage its position in search of better trade deals, and again, thematically, to regain greater control over all aspects of economic policy and that prosperity would subsequently follow. Those who wished to remain in the EU highlighted the immediate challenges of leaving and the very possible (as far as I can tell, and again, I'm not an expert) economic depression which might follow.
Both sides exaggerated the demonstrable benefits of their position and the negatives of the opposition's position, although an argument can be made, in my opinion, that those who campaigned to leave may have been more willfully [misleading](https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2017/08/gettyimages-576855020_1_.jpg?itok=670Cg7sW). I reiterate, however, that both sides made plenty of claims about the consequences of Brexit which have so far proven wrong.

Ultimately, it seems to me that people already knew in their hearts what they wanted, and the arguments, for and against, positive and negative, weren't that significant. In the words of William James: ""Instinct leads, intelligence does but follow"". I may be wrong, however.

In my opinion, for what it's worth, Brexit will probably have negative short-term consequences while the dust settles, but ultimately Britain will either be similar to how it was if not slightly better. This opinion is obviously not disconnected from my personal philosophy and implicit biases, whichever they might be.

632,"&gt; Surely it should have been encountered in larger European countries as well already if it came from the continent to the UK?

UK does a lot more genome sequencing than other countries so is much more likely to have picked it up. E.g. Public Health Wales sequenced about 4,000 genomes in the past week, more than the whole of France since the beginning of the pandemic. (BBC News, https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55413666) That's Wales - a country of 3 million people - testing mode in one week than the whole of France - the same size as the whole UK - has done for most of this year.

Now, its possible that patient zero is a resident of the UK, but based on the fact we don't know, it's just as likely it is not a resident of the UK. Many European countries have gone through the same spike as the UK, and considering the Continent has a much larger total population, I think it's more likely to be the Continent than them.

851,"&gt;Idk why ur defending the Swiss stance in WW2. The Swiss government did huge amounts of bad shit including letting Nazis abuse your system. In comparison to the Swiss us Austrians actually own up to the shit we did in WW2. Going to a KZ is basically mandatory in school and we spend years learning about Nazis.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile the Swiss government still has millions in Nazi money stolen from Jewish families stowed away in bank accounts.

There is a difference in acknowledging the moral burden caused by neutrality and other policies in WW2 vs. taking any unsubstantiated and incorrect claims and letting them uncommented.

Let's be real, 99% of the people commenting here only have superficial knowledge of Switzerland in WW2 and with respect to this article about China they haven't gone much further than reading the headline.

E.g. claiming that the ""Swiss government still has millions of Nazi money stolen from Jewish families"", is one of those unsubstantiated claims. There have been several treaties to retribute financial assets to Jewish families, and the treaty of Washington in 1946 dealt with the retribution of gold bought by Switzerland and German assets on Swiss bank accounts.",,/r/europe/comments/ki15c6/switzerland_has_granted_schengen_visas_to_chinese/ggppav0/,curiossceptic,1608660906

I guess when it comes to international cooperation, using two surnames is better than one - just as a reminder. Otherwise Marie Curie sounds better I guess.

As for Poles denying she was in part French, considering she had French citizenship... yeah, that can be annoying. It doesn't really matter, it matters who she was as a person, and her story. How we label that is not that important.

989,"&gt; **Passport checks for British citizens would continue, but those at border with Spain would end**

&gt; Talks between the UK, Gibraltar and Spain that would allow the territory to enter the Schengen area with free movement at the Rock’s crucial land border are well advanced, according to reports in the Spanish media.

&gt; Gibraltar relies heavily on inflows of goods and people, including 15,000 Spaniards who cross the border daily to work in the territory, whose population is less than 34,000.

&gt; Brexit means that from January 1, Madrid would be able to create a hard border between Spain and Gibraltar, strangling the territory’s economy.

&gt; Spanish newspaper El País reported on Tuesday that Gibraltar and Spain are close to a deal that would allow for free movement across the border, with Gibraltar entering the Schengen space.

&gt; Ironically, the change forced by Brexit would bring Gibraltar closer to the EU than ever, with UK visitors still required to show their passports on arrival in the territory, while anyone crossing from Spain into Gibraltar or vice versa would walk through an open border.

&gt; Entry into Schengen would also allow Gibraltar to have flights from the 26 countries signed up to the open-border agreement, while currently only flights to and from Britain take place as Spain has not agreed to the territory entering the EU aviation space.

&gt; The difficulty lies in the policing of the new Schengen border in Gibraltar’s ports and airport, with the Rock reportedly refusing to allow Spanish security forces onto its territory. Instead, the different sides are considering the option of bringing in agents from the EU’s Frontex border agency.

&gt; Fabian Picardo, chief minister of Gibraltar, said at the weekend that “a Schengen-style agreement would be the most positive”, and thanked the Spanish government for its willingness to pursue a solution.

&gt; “We are just a few phrases away from a historic agreement,” Mr Picardo said.

&gt; Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha González Laya has repeatedly stated that her government’s aim is to “create an area of shared prosperity” around the Bay of Gibraltar, which includes some of Spain’s poorest urban areas with unemployment levels of more than 30 per cent.  

&gt; Sources from Spain’s Foreign Ministry said the talks were continuing on Tuesday as negotiations between the EU and Britain also ground on over the future relationship post-Brexit.

&gt; Spain is preparing for the possibility of there being no UK-EU trade deal by commissioning work on a new customs area for goods on the Spanish side of the border with Gibraltar. Even if there is a Schengen-style arrangement allowing people to cross the border, goods would be subject to checks and tariffs in the event of Britain becoming a third-party state under a hard Brexit.","Glory to you, Putin our saviour",/r/europe/comments/ki8d6z/deal_nearly_done_for_gibraltar_to_join_schengen/ggpbrcb/,coffeebiscuitsandtea,1608654036

I can reassure you that if you eat real raf tomatos in a restaurant in Almería or at a farmer's home - a farmer that has salty land - you won't go back to your valencian grandmother's tomatos.

I get the same from people all over Spain. Their ""pueblo"" in a random place in Soain has the best tomatos. No matter id it's the rainy north or a mountain province, or flatland. No, they don't, they're just eating the tomatos when they are in season and harvested fully ripened. If you did that with some of the varieties thwt exclusively grlw in Almería for quality, you'd have your mins blown.

But you can't beat Almería's salty land (that can't grow a lot of crops because of it anymore) coupled with all the days of sun they get.

It is not Almería's fault that consumers want a seasonal fruit to be the same year round, and that the food industry selects for a product first of all for price and then that lasts long (for storage and export). Ripe tomatos are a logistic nightmare. They are as fragile as blueberries or strawberries and if you prioritised quality, you wouldn't even refrigerate them (maybe to 20 degrees? But with a purpose built refrigerator that doesn't blow 2 degree air until 20 degrees are reached, otherwise you'd cold-burn the ones closest to the vent). The tomatos would last 48-96 hours, from the moment they are picked til they are consumed, something like a 24 hour shelf life..., you couldn't even stack them. They wouldn't even be getting ""primera categoría"" as ripe tomatos tend to develope defects. You'd be paying 30-40€/kg at a supermarket if they factor in their material losses/risks for something rather ugly. There's just no market for it compared to the usual 1-4€/kg.

It's not even ""from Almería"" for real sometimes. In certain weeks, in summer, (in fucking summer, which is prime tomato season) the chapest tomatos at Mercamadrid are polish and dutch, but since no one's gonna check and that is a fucking abomination, your local fruit shop is gonna label it as from Spain, Almería.

1214,"&gt; Genocide

Maybe you are getting confused with the US and its Manifest Destiny.  

The UK attempted to provide relief. A strange way to commit genocide. 

&gt; Confronted by widespread crop failure in November 1845, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, purchased £100,000 worth of maize and cornmeal secretly from America[85] with Baring Brothers initially acting as his agents. The government hoped that they would not ""stifle private enterprise"" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to poor weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.[86] The initial shipments were of unground dried kernels, but the few Irish mills in operation were not equipped for milling maize and a long and complicated milling process had to be adopted before the meal could be distributed.[87] In addition, before the cornmeal could be consumed, it had to be ""very much"" cooked again, or eating it could result in severe bowel complaints.[86] Due to its yellow colour, and initial unpopularity, it became known as ""Peel's brimstone"".[88]


&gt;The British Association for the Relief of Distress in Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland, known as the British Relief Association (BRA), was a private charity of the mid-19th century in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Established by a group of prominent aristocrats, bankers and philanthropists in 1847, the charity was the largest private provider of relief during the Great Irish Famine and Highland Potato Famine of the 1840s.[1][2] During its brief period of operation, the Association received donations and support from many notable politicians and royalty, including Queen Victoria.

&gt;In total, approximately £500,000 (equivalent to around £52.26 million in 2019) was raised by the British Relief Association.[10] Over 15,000 individual contributions were sent to the BRA secretariat, each of which was carefully noted in the committee's records.[11]",,/r/europe/comments/ki1210/population_of_the_british_isles_1821_and_2019/ggohb53/,Inner-Carrot8299,1608631773

The federal council submitted a formal application for membership. However, this was done before Swiss voters were voting on joining the EEA. After Swiss voters rejected joining the EEA in 1992, the application was subsequently frozen. In 2001 there was another vote to determine whether Switzerland should ask the EU to open accession negotiations. This referendum was also rejected. The application was later withdrawn. So even though, the Swiss government did submit a formal request for association in 1992, negotiations and the process never really started.",,/r/europe/comments/khkluw/european_union_current_situation/ggnrwa5/,curiossceptic,1608610215

Also I don’t think it was entirely over engineered, this is from the Wikipedia page:

“The V1's first untethered flight was on 3 August 1940, after over 100 hours of ground and tethered testing. In October, it was flown to the test centre at Rechlin to be demonstrated, and while there set a top speed of 182 km/h (113 mph), a climb rate of 528 m (1,732 ft) per minute, and a maximum altitude of 7,100 m (23,300 ft), performance far greater than had been demonstrated by any other helicopter in the world.”

1508,"Interesting development in the justice system in Romania. 

A lawyer has represented and helped some defenestrable scumbags get away with a lot of assets (both tangible and intagible). Some received prison sentences, only that one has escaped, others have immunity due to extradition technicalities, another got suspended sentencing because he has relations with the secret services &amp; because ”it's not illegal to promote &amp; advertise in mass-media”, and the said lawyer has been sentenced in prison for 5 years. 

Now, some lawyer houses are protesting the sentence given to the lawyer. Their argument is that the lawyer must be separated from the clients, saying that prosecutors &amp; judges have that eminent immunity themselves. Others have said that, if a lawyer helps law-breaking individuals with certain nuances that clearly are breaking the law or avoid it intentionally just barely from not breaking it, he or she is liable as well for committing crime(s) in one form or another (such as conspiracy).

It has one of the best cuisines in the world - a blend of eastern, balkan and mediterranean. Always amazed how good it is when I travel abroad and compare, especially to most of western europe. Koreans in Seoul didn’t believe me when I said that salads are the cheapest things on our restaurant menus.

It has a crazy concentration of natural features - mountains, beaches, lakes, rivers etc. All within quick driving distance. I don’t mean just bulgaria itself, but the driving distance in the countries around it. Greece beaches are 2.5 h drive from Sofia.

The people like to party and there is no shortage of bars and clubs and the like. Even now in the lockdown the police were busting illegal latin dance socials for example.

And since its in the EU you can work remotely to most of europe and get close to western salaries, but with the BG living standard. Don’t even get me started on the taxes - they get smaller the bigger the salary you have(!).

Rather than my alleged bias, I think the fact that you got stuck on ""Turkish-speaking"" shows the borderline  pathological obsession you people have with race and ethnicity. Not being Turkish is not a sin, you know.

And as a half ""Turkish"" Alevi, I dont feel comfortable Turkish nationalists (who happen to be overwhelmingly Sunni and who were murdering my people regardless of alleged ethnic origins) to claim the religion I was born into and presume to talk on my behalf.

1774,"Lol race and Dna.
Race is a pseudoscience concept, defined by 1800 crack heads who were trying to distinct themselves from black skinned africans.
You have to draw a line, either turkish is a race, or there is no such thing as races.
Race is a human defined concept.

From harvard Stin;
 ‘Race’ cannot be biologically defined due to genetic variation among human individuals and populations.  The old concept of the “five races:” African, Asian, European, Native American, and Oceanian. According to this view, variation between the races is large, and thus, the each race is a separate category. Additionally, individual races are thought to have a relatively uniform genetic identity. Human populations do roughly cluster into geographical regions. However, variation between different regions is small, thus blurring the lines between populations. Furthermore, variation within a single region is large, and there is no uniform identity.

If separate racial or ethnic groups actually existed, we would expect to find “trademark” alleles and other genetic features that are characteristic of a single group but not present in any others. However, the 2002 Stanford study found that only 7.4% of over 4000 alleles were specific to one geographical region. Furthermore, even when region-specific alleles did appear, they only occurred in about 1% of the people from that region—hardly enough to be any kind of trademark. Thus, there is no evidence that the groups we commonly call “races” have distinct, unifying genetic identities. In fact, there is ample variation within races",,/r/europe/comments/khgd9c/a_turkishgerman_lawyer_called_police_over_a/ggn4cj9/,edexark,1608597098

Also, these aren't very good examples. The first two appear to be endings, the last one has ""i"" in all languages.

&gt; Before standardization of the alphabet in the early twentieth century, the name was also spelled Кыѣвъ, Киѣвъ, or Кіѣвъ with the now-obsolete letter yat. The Old Ukrainian spelling from the 14th and 15th centuries was nominally *Києвъ, but various attested spellings include кїєва (gen.), Кїєвь and Киев (acc.), кїєво or кїєвом (ins.), києвє, Кіеве, Кїєвѣ, Києвѣ, or Киѣве (loc.)

The modern spelling is modern, established long after English took its spelling from French which took it from German Kiew.

They are though, if anything they're even more critical. 

&gt;  But if people don't sleep in their truck in Europe

We do sleep in them but we tend to be in them for days or a week at most. There are some though who are in them for weeks at a time but because of EU laws they have to take a weekly rest break away from the cab.

&gt; So what's the beef residents have with having truck stops in Kent?

People in the UK look down on lorry drivers, they treat them like shit, like scum. Everyone wants the stuff we carry but don't want the lorries so thanks to NIMBYism (not in my back yard) people object to any plans for lorry parks.

&gt; Like, are people worried about backup beeper noise or what?

No, they just think we're all scum, that we'll block up all their streets and that we'll bring down the tone of the area and leave it covered in litter and shit and piss. The only reason lorries do now is because of lack of any facilities but the locals are too short-sighted to realise this.

You mentioned immigration isn't an on/off switch, the perfect counter example is Germany in 2016, one country can decide to suddenly 'switch on' and allow 1M immigrants to come and replace their aging population.

As for attractiveness, France is actually pretty much well ranked usually, for example the [average net income is comparatively superior to the Dutch one](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9ayowq/european_countries_by_net_average_monthly_salary/), Paris metropolitan area alone has close to the same GDP as the whole Netherlands despite having 5M population less. That's definitely not a problem of jobs nor lower wages, as for language barrier, current immigration to Europe is for a great part from french speaking countries, English is less used than in Nordic European countries but still widely used and understood. So the barrier wouldn't count that much, France also tops both [FDI](https://www.bio.org/events/bio-digital/sessions/662798) and [university/research rankings.](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/foreign-investment-france-among-the-top-5-most-attractive-countries)",,/r/europe/comments/khda0k/net_migration_rate_population_change_not/ggmd3cr/,MendiOndoan,1608582833

It's completely normal for these names to be the same as in some other language. There's nothing weird about it, it implies nothing, it doesn't express an opinion, it's just a name.

Ukrainian also has a lot of its own names for cities in foreign countries. Some of them are the same as in other languages. Nobody cares, because it's not important, it's at most interesting.

So ask yourself, why do you care so much about this? Why do you want your capital to be spelled like some village that doesn't have international names and uses your (to foreigners) weird romanization spelling, instead of using their own names with spellings and pronunciations adapted to their languages? It's just silly. You're doing the opposite of what you want, you're destroying the international traditional knowledge about your capital.

previous government not only didnt care about them, it actively sabotaged  opurtunities for those regions to develop,  I am talking about via carpathia, highway going from Lithuania, through eastern Poland(least developed region), through slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and eventually ends up in Greek port city of Thessaloniki. Also in Romania there would be fork toward to the Black Sea port town of Constanta.

I would say that this highway can have very important role in the region seeing how it would connect Baltic sea, Black sea and Aegean Sea, it can bring significant investment toward eastern Poland.

So what happen was that someone from eastern poland made a petition to try to get funds from EU for this project, trying to get it added to EU TEN-T(Trans-European Transport Network) and stuff, EU agreed to send someone check viability of this project. so everything was going well but here is where the PO sabotaged it, PO MEP's requested this petition to be closed, claiming that this highway is not needed and that this region is already getting enough money, which is a total BS seeing how its least developed region with highest unemployment. some of those regions are on list of poorest regions in the EU.

&gt;“The Commission or the member states would essentially indemnify the companies against the cost of legal action that followed those claims,” she said, adding that these events were rare and that she had not seen all contracts signed so far.

Mhmmm..

Reads to me like the EU isn't on the hook for anything that goes wrong, however if any member state wants to actually take delivery of any of the vaccine they'll need to protect the suppliers from civil prosecution.

No vaccine manufacture would agree to anything less with this vaccine. To do so would be opening themselves up to bankruptcy in the event of anything going wrong 1,3,5 years down the line. And for what?

2287,"&gt; We are back in a full-scale economic crisis. In London and the south east, the richest part of the UK and engine of the economy, normal commerce has been suspended by the imposition of Tier 4. And the decision of much of the EU and a growing number of rich countries to put the whole UK into quarantine is devastating for trade.

&gt; What are the immediate priorities? Probably the most important one is basic: the creation of a facility to give rapid Covid-19 tests to all lorry drivers leaving the UK so that the transport of freight can be restarted as quickly as possible. Second, to end the cancerous uncertainty for businesses about how they will be buying from and selling to EU countries in just ten days time, after the transition to full Brexit ends.

&gt; Right now, the border closure means importers and exporters are frantically trying to work out how to ship anything. So it is grotesquely irresponsible to keep them in the dark about what the terms of trade will be on 1 January with customers in their biggest market.

&gt; For what it is worth, there is no ability to extend the status quo — the transition — by more than a few days and on an extemporised emergency basis. Or at least so UK and EU sources tell me. And a few extra days of talks are very unlikely to give UK and EU leaders the space and time to conclude negotiations much more rationally than is the case right now.

&gt; So the PM has to stop prevaricating and choose. He either has to accept the terms, especially on fishing and future competition, from which he instinctively recoils — and risk months of attacks from his Brexiteer colleagues saying he capitulated under duress, and which may terminate his time as PM (especially as many of those Brexiteer MP critics also loath his stewardship of the Covid-19 response).

&gt; Or the PM needs to mandate the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, to frantically try and nail down a raft of mini deals to lessen the inevitable disruption of failing to agree an overarching free trade deal and security — and do so in a way that doesn't turn the UK into a pariah in its relationship with the EU.

&gt; What is happening to the UK could hardly be more serious. Much of any government response, like testing lorry drivers, is obvious and uncontroversial.

&gt; But in respect of the future relationship with the EU — and in the context of the Covid-19 crisis — the outstanding elements of the free trade deal are relatively trivial. The PM knows the important elements of the available deal. He simply has to decide whether he wants them. It is his decision, and his alone.","Glory to you, Putin our saviour",/r/europe/comments/khifk2/covid_and_brexit_are_about_to_collide_the/ggl6njs/,coffeebiscuitsandtea,1608560941

2289,"In addition to the woman already in isolation since Sunday because she tested positive for the ""English variant"" of Sars Cov2, there are currently five other suspected cases in Italy. They are people who arrived by plane from London to Bari, Fiumicino and Palermo and tested positive to the swab: they are carrying out analyses to understand if they have contracted the ""standard"" virus or the mutated one with greater transmission capacity.

The girl from Bari left with fever - The first case, reports La Repubblica, concerns a 25 year old girl from the province of Bari who landed on Thursday in the Apulian airport on a Ryanair plane from London: she tested positive for the coronavirus and now analyses are being carried out at the Zooprophylactic Institute of Foggia to understand if she has the variant. Passengers on her flight will be called to be swabbed. The girl, who had a fever when she landed, admitted to having had flu-like symptoms while she was in England and to having left without waiting for the result of a swab done before leaving to return home. She is in good condition.

The young doctor who arrived at Fiumicino on Sunday - Another case of Covid was then found on Sunday among the last passengers who landed at Fiumicino from Great Britain. The swab will be analyzed at Spallanzani to ascertain if the British variant is present: the results will arrive in the next days. The patient, a young doctor, is in isolation at home.

The three passengers who landed in Palermo - Three of the 134 passengers on the Ryanair flight from London that landed in Palermo last night have tested positive. Rapid antigenic swabs carried out by the doctors of the Palermo Hospital and Usmaf had given a negative result. Subsequent checks have ascertained the presence of three infected and two doubtful cases. All passengers are in quarantine.

Yeah, sure. They got sanctions, economic crisis, a huge ton of problems, historically high support of Western way in Ukraine and inability of a significant pro-Russian part of Ukrainian citizens to participate in elections which makes impossible for them to affect our future.

But that is the degree at which I can see determinism at the most. And that is mostly due to the one ""super-intelligent"" life form we know of, humans, are often illogical in their actions and decisions.

There are ways of telling what would probably happen during or at the end of a certain chain of actions, thoughts and decisions included, but we can be never be sure - and probably won't ever be sure until (if) we can map the entire brain, understand it and become able to simulate whole human thought processes.

The minimum european forest cover was reached in 1830, I think. Since then, we've been burning fossils and exploiting the forests of other continents. Among those fossils of course is the petroleum of Norwegian North Sea, since the 1980s and until some near future. Those fields peaked in the 2000s, so to compensate we invented things like ""biodiesel"" sourced from palm oil, prompting [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) in Indonesia, for example.

Of course, we'll remember that Norway, due to latitude, has the second-to-lowest [population density in Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/mapToolClosed.do?tab=map&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00003&amp;toolbox=types), which makes for quite atypical approaches in land management.

If it was a simple pro/against nazi question, you'd see nothing but green on the map.

As mentioned in the article u/frbnfr linked, seems like Russia has formed the resolution in order to drive its own agenda and try to rewrite history.  It's definitely not just about who condemns nazis and who doesn't (which is what Russia tries to claim in public), it's a much larger package of claims about history and the rights of different countries.

Now that so many countries abstained, Russia can point fingers at a lot of countries, claiming we are all somehow pro-nazi as we didn't swallow the entire package. 

&gt;Speaking to *European Voice* before the vote, Lithuania’s  foreign minister, Linas Linkevičius, said that “no one should doubt that  we are condemning fascism”, but, he continued, “under cover of this  condemnation, Russia is pursuing its own agenda”.  
&gt;  
&gt;“De facto, Russia is trying to attack the Baltic states and to determine history in its own way,” he said.

2582,"No? You are wrongfully assuming that the term American English doesn't exist?

Listen, of course it's not another language, but there are a bunch of similarities in the american dialects that differ from the british dialects. Most notably spelling and intonation. But also some words have completely different meanings (i.e. ""rubber""), or sometimes different words having the same meaning (i.e. ""truck"" and ""lorry""). 

In conclusion the term ""British English"" refers to the features of the English language that are very similar across the british isles, while the term ""American English"" refers to those features that are most similar across north america. That's why you can also go more specific and use the term Scottish English.

 There is nothing wrong with these terms.

2683,"&gt;Anyway, coalitions consisting of left and right wing

Maybe, it's because of where where I am from with a FPTP system. In my province/state. The liberals and the conservatives banded together to win against the social democratic party. However, the downside is that the liberal wing of the party ended up losing its voice as the party itself went further right. 

&gt;I'm not too sceptical of it functioning, in the worst case they could simply agree on rolling back all the policies and laws Fidesz introduced and then agree on further elections.

What policies would they roll back? I doubt they would agree to roll back all the polices when a lot of the policies helped Hungarians, such as  nationalizing IV clinics.  I am also sure Hungarians do approve of some of their policies too. 

Frankly, for Hungary to go from 1.2 tfr to 1.6 tfr (is still low) under the Orban administration proves that their administration is doing something right. Even though, their policies against the LGBT community (ex: banning adoptions) is disgusting.

Can you please delete this post?

And yes, it is the greatest evil, bigger than Stalin. The difference is that the Nazis literally declared whole nations to be the lesser people and were working openly towards enslaving them.

I understand that people in the baltics despise 45 years of the communist oppression, but from there to ""deleting"" those who fought against the nazism is... Well, a treason.

You are most likely mixing it up with a tale where the protagonist kills 7 flies with one blow, then later he proceeds to intimidate his enemies by saying that he took down 7 with one blow (without telling what or who he has taken down). I am not sure but I believe this tale has german origins.

Another source of your confusion could have been that 2, 4 and 7 sound very similar in hungarian.

Nobody ever says ""kill seven flies with one strike"". It indeed is ""hit two flies with one blow"". And ""hit"" is the correct translation because the killing of said flies is only implied. I also don't approve your translation of ""csapás"" as ""strike"". It is inaccurate. 

On another note: when would killing seven flies ever be a good idiom? When is someone ever accomplishing seven different things with one action? It isn't a coincidence that every other language has 2 and not 7 as the number.

 After going on a hunt for actual primary statistical data I indeed found lower numbers:

**67% from WCIOM in 2019** (switch to table view for data):  

https://wciom.ru/analytical-reviews/analiticheskii-obzor/rozhdestvenskij-post-2019

**71% from Pew in 2017**

**63% for Levada in 2020** 

https://www.levada.ru/2020/10/28/vera-v-sverhestestvennoe/

The last one has historic data with the chart hitting my claimed 80% in 2009 and aroud 2017, but it also displays the fluctuation over the years. But 85% is way off.

2. I don’t know about Nakchevan but the Karabakh churches seem fine beside the usual wartime bombs.

3. Armenia literally destroyed all proof of Turks and Azeris ever existing in the territory it controlled. Armenia has one mosque right now, one. And it’s an Iranian mosque. All the Azeri cultural sites are destroyed. This is not seen in any of Armenias neighbors. Armenia is the only post Soviet nation with a homogenous population because of mass ethnic cleansing.

Nowadays I would say science has thoroughly explored all the knowledge of these ""magicians"", the ones that actually work are being commercialized (e.g. aspirin derives from willow crust), the rest are deemed to yield non-reproducible results. For a ""magician"" that's enough: if a single patient is cured (sometimes even for natural reasons that have nothing to do with their ""magic"") they will tell all their friends. All the other cases in which the plant didn't work will be just ignored. Also, I believe placebo effect makes 90% of ""magic"".

3178,"While Britain has some chance outside the EU, the Southern countries would probably crash badly upon leaving. Many of their problems are structural or even societal, and have little to do with the EU. Bad demographics are the result of low birthrates (which have exacerbated the problems of ageing and pensions) and poor immigration and education policies (which mean that even the dwindling youth population is often unskilled or underskilled). Poor investment climates are exacerbated by red tape. Low R&amp;D intensity is the result of some of the above, plus a historic tendency to prioritize infrastructure investments over ""soft power"" development. I (this time subjective) opinion I have, at least about Spain - where I lived for a while - is that there is this sort of risk-averse-ness/pessimism/fatalism that I cannot really describe very well. I lived in one of the most amazing regions on the planet (Euskadi) yet many young people were still talking about their plight as if they lived in Uganda :D.

The only theoretical advantage of leaving the Euro (rather than the EU as a whole) would be the fact that they could inflate their way out of debt and into some growth. This logic is, however, partially flawed. First of all, because investors are now adept at pricing in the risk of inflation, hence access to credit would not improve as much as in the past. And secondly because the structural problems they have cannot be solved with money alone, they need sound **policy**.

3228,"I think it wouldn't be a big deal to anybody if he just wasn't thankful. But he's not just not thankful, he's outright shitty in his assessments.

Calling a whole country that has basically spent the last 75 years with political self-mortification, still nazistic as a whole is one thing. Claiming that authoritarianism still is a guiding principle of today's Germany is another. Both of these claims wouldn't  necessarily be illegitimate - if they weren't supported only by three unpleasant taxi drivers and an allegedly aggressive shop owner. Neither of these experiences substantiate such strong claims. If his claims had a more robust foundation it would be alright. If he (even remotely) attempted some differentiation, I am sure a lot of people would actually agree.  It basically is a national consensus that there's an issue with authoritarian thinking. But the way he framed it makes it appear as if he's more concerned about getting the headline than about actual fascism.

An impression that is also supported by his 'yeah, Britain is colonial but at least polite'. Like, what on earth does this mean?

Rather than the terrible racism in Berlin (probably the third most leftist (major) city in all of Germany), I think the actual reasons for him to hate it here were his own cultural default and thus subsequently the cultural differences he experienced, a wrong idea about 'the west' in general and Germany in particular and a very strong ego.

When I go living in another country, do I expect to see everything fulfilled just how I'd like it? Do I expect people to speak to me in my language? Do I start to insult all of them when I had a few bad experiences with some individuals? Oh, I forgot, I am not a 'fighter for justice' and renowned artist.

3231,"&gt;You mention only things that fit the ""Russia-Serbia"" bad guys. Yes both done shit. But you fail to mention how both of those also had biggest loses during both WW1 and WW2,

Russia does not have biggest losses in WW2 per capita, Belarus and Ukraine lost more than Russia (we are comparing Serbia and Russia, not Yugoslavia and Russia).

&gt; fail to mention how big portions of Serbs and Russians are also ""out of borders"" of their mother countries due to bullshit communist divisions of Yugoslavia and Soviet Union etc.

They are not exactly out of borders, this is common for many fallen empires, they leave their people behind on lands that did not belong to them. This includes people who move to these lands to ""help uncivilized locals"", those locals who decided it would be better to become part of the ""main"" ethnos, etc.

The point is, this is not specific to Russia or Serbia, this is something that is quite common for all empires that collapsed.

&gt; Serbia is officially independent since 2006, first time after 1918, and  before 1918 and after 2006, it hasn't ""occupied"" a single country. So  your ""simplification"" is in fact ""falsification"". For the most of the  time, Serbia WAS occupied by local powers. So your analogy is weird in  fact. 

Same could be said about Russia, it wasn't Russia, but Soviet Union. This is factually correct, but of course no one would take this seriously.

&gt;  Just question it, and question your irrational hate of Serbia once more,  given the fact that we have little to no historic contact at all.

Serbian Empire has nothing to do with Serbian population in Bosnia and lost persecuted population in Croatia, as Serbian Empire wasn't including those territories officialy. In fact, they lived there even before creation of Yugoslavia, Bosnia itself was majority Serbian right before creation of Yugoslavia (check out the demographic censuses). So no, you're not right about that one.

&gt;Same could be said about Russia, it wasn't Russia, but Soviet Union. This is factually correct, but of course no one would take this seriously.

Still, it is a fact. What's also a fact is that Serbs were only barely a ""dominant"" nation within Yugoslavia, and fact is that all inter-ethnic conflicts weren't one sided at all, except for one: WW2 Ustaše which was pretty much one sided when genocide happened.

&gt;Now do you imply that the Ottomans where Slavs and you bring them up?

No, Ottomans were the ottomans. Slavs are Slavs and Turks are Turks. The name Ottoman represents nothing but the citizenship of an Empire. Can you at least give proper examples?- Oh wait you cannot. You are just full of your own individual nonsense, born from your racial bias and bigotry.

&gt;Cause even the Slavs are culturally closer to Central Europeans than Turks are to Slavs. 

That is so damn wrong on so many levels that I don't even want to try proving that wrong. This cannot even be considered as a valid arguement because if it was, Greeks would be culturally the closest to the Turks and either Greeks are not European too or Turks are European and you are simply skipping around to display your racism through half-assed claims.

&gt;I am also aware. As a Greek, I ""could"" be 100% Turk and never know about it. Still, the same isn't true for the western Europeans, the Northern, central. You know, our other European neighbours. So race is a perfectly valid argument, depending on who places it. 

So you basically said ""It isn't up to me to speak about race simply because I am mixed so I am hoping that someone else would be racist in my place and somehow exclude you guys from the rest of Europe""?

&gt;Bottom line, cause I'm bored of people trying to convince me there's a tree when there's a forest, all this ""Turkey is Europe"" shit has been fired up when people realised what a cash cow our bureaucratic idiots can be. That's all. Culturally, it's laughable to imply that you share any similarities to any central and western civilization beyond Vienna or the Caucasus.

So again, Turks and Greeks are similar. So we either both would be European or both would not be. What are again? European? :)",,/r/europe/comments/kgbrpj/the_difference_between_turkish_and_azerbaijani_oc/ggho1vs/,Nocturn4lle,1608480641

3382,"&gt; Holy shit at the attitude. Fuck me, I thought that German superiority complex was taken care of a while back, but it seems to be back in full force.

Really? Right back to nazi comparisons because I don't think people like you should get to decide who we trade with and I don't want to pay the bill for others? Not surprised that you have to resort to that, considering that that is the favorite tactic for leeches when they want to rip of Germany. Maybe try a real argument.

&gt; So you don't want another country to exert influence over you.... but you are continuing to fund Russia to do exactly that and are A-OK with them doing it on your allies. Great logic right there. 

Holy shit. Is your reading comprehension that bad? I wrote that we do not want **any more countries** excerting influence over our gas supply **then necessary**. So we are cutting them out and obviously Russia is still going to have influence over us. We are fine with that. If our allies are not fine with Russian influence over them, our allies are free to get other gas suppliers they just have to pay the cost that comes with it. That Russia has influence over their gas supply is their own decision and they can change that whenever they want. When will you get that in your thick skull?

&gt; You started about costs, not me. And I am fine with paying more, like I said, if that is the price of not fucking over our allies and not giving Russia more influence.

Because all of this is about cost, despite all your attempts to deny that. If you want to pay more you are free to do it. I don't care where you waste your money. It's not our problem that you and some EE countries are shitting themselves because of big bad scary Russia. 

&gt; Poor, poor Germany. Everyone is taking advantage of you, aren't they. Need a shoulder to cry on?

Aww, poor little r/cissoniuss and his EE allies. All talk but when it comes to fund their own interests they always go to others. 

&gt; Already said I am OK with paying a bit more for our gas. No clue why you keep pretending I am not. They say we the Dutch are a cheap people, but it seems we can learn a bit from our Eastern neighbors for a change.

Then what's your fucking problem? Pay more and shoulder all the additional costs instead of us. Congratulations, you just ""saved"" the Ukraine with your generousity. 

&gt; Yes, it is, since sadly the line will also be used to push gas to the rest of Western Europe, like my country that is importing more gas over time due to closing down our own fields. And again: I am OK with paying a little bit more if it means not fucking over our allies along the way.

""push gas to Western Europe"". Yeah right, your country is forced to buy that gas. It is not! If you don't want Russian gas build more LNG terminals and buy gas from someone else. It is completely up to your country. Go vote for a government that is stupid enough to continuously damage their own economy and their own citizens so you can feel better about yourself.

&gt; So... why isn't Germany doing this, but does it keep funding Russia with large amounts of money? Do as I say, not as I do, I guess?

I am not the one bitching about Russian influence. We get cheap gas and in return give Russia more influence over our gas supply. If they ever try to fuck us over we use the more expensive alternatives. YOU and EE countries don't want that Russian influence of THEIR gas supply so it is on THEM to change that can pay the cost.
And again that bullshit about funding Russia while all of Germany's critics are trading with Russia and buying its ressources as well. Fucking hypocrit. 

&gt; It's shameful and disgusting how you are more upset about paying a few euros more on your gas bill compared to the security of your allies. Really showing your true face here under all the bullshit solidarity talk from the Germans.

It's shameful and disgusting how our so called allies are not willing to pay for their own security and their own energy supply and how leeches and their all-talk-no-action supporters try to put the burden on us. Go rip of someone else or cry in a corner about how mean Russia is, we don't need allies who constantly are a burden and we certainly don't need moral advice from countries who aren't willing to actually pay for what they think is right.",,/r/europe/comments/kg4lkz/russias_nord_stream_2_never_be_launched_with_new/gghplpv/,-GrimmWar-,1608481470

&gt;&gt;  Anyway, not everyone lives in the countryside mate. 
&gt;
&gt;Not everyone lives in London and I'm not your mate. Also the countryside is more expensive for property than towns and cities thanks to cunts from London wanting to move to the countryside and paying inflated prices to do so.

OK then WHERE do you get a one bed apartment for £320pcm?

&gt;&gt; The majority of people live in expensive areas such as London, Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester and such so what's the point of saying you pay 320 a month?
&gt;
&gt;Because tens of millions of people don't. You can find accommodation at that price throughout huge swathes of the midlands and the north (including Greater Manchester), Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

&gt;And before you flap your gums about it being cheap because no jobs, London actually has lower rates of employment than the national average - the highest rate of employment is actually in the East of England where you can also find somewhere for £320.

3455,"&gt;The Turkic people are an ethnically different group of people

Yes. I don't remember opposing to that.

&gt;Europeans with different ancestry trees that originate from many lineages but the Turkic. That is racially.

You have just debunked the Indo-European language family and kicked the entirety of the Carpathians and Balkans out of Europe, making the term Europe open to discussion. What seperates Europe from Asia? Where do you start and end the ""Europe""? There are absolutely no physical obstacles in between the ""continents"" of Europe. I guess now we will have to call it the West Asia.

Also, really? Racially? Your race is as mixed as your arguements and head. Your family tree is a stew of countless races and you stand before me, daring to mention the ""race"". Chill out and get your head outside your room, my darling Hitler. One DNA test and you turn out to be Indian, I would laugh my ass off.

Expresses deep concern about about the glorification, in any form, of the Nazi movement,  neo-Nazism  and  former  members  of  the  Waffen  SS  organization, including by erecting monuments and memorials and holding public demonstrations in the name of the glorification of the Nazi past, the Nazi movement and neo-Nazism, as well as by declaring or attempting to declare such members and **those who fought against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement participants in national liberation movements**.

Basically an attempt by Russia to equate anyone who thought against Soviet occupation with Nazis.

&gt; 13. Expresses  deep  concern about about increased  frequency  of  attempts  and activities intended to desecrate or demolish monuments erected in remembrance of those  who  fought  against  Nazism  during  the  Second  World  War,  as  well  as  to unlawfully exhume or remove the remains of such persons, and in this regard urges States to fully comply with their relevant obligations, inter alia, under article34of Additional ProtocolIto the Geneva Conventions of 1949;

We occupied and annexed your country and build monuments of our Soviet heroes invaders there, don't you dare to demolish it now. 

&gt; 22. Takes note of the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur that revisionism and attempts to falsify history may, in certain circumstances, fall under the prohibition of hate speech under article4(a)of the Convention, which States are required to declare as offences punishable by law.

Falsify which version of history? I guess that it's selective Russian version of history.

&gt; 26. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of the countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World War, in particular those committed by the SS organization and by those who fought against the  anti-Hitler  coalition  and  collaborated  with  the  Nazi  movement,  and  may negatively  influence  children  and  young  people,  and  that  failure  by  States  to effectively  address  such  practices  is  incompatible  with  the  obligations  of  States Members  of  the  United  Nations  under  its  Charter,  including  those  related  to  the purposes and principles of the Organization

If you teach your children that your fathers fought bravely against soviet occupants and that millions of people suffered under the Soviet occupation, you will do great injustice to the memory of the countless victims, because victims were only Soviet soldiers, whereas 300,000 Lithuanians deported to Soviet gulags were just an enemy.",LT ,/r/europe/comments/kgtiys/un_general_assembly_resolution_a73157_combating/ggh94wt/,Sutartine,1608474311

Also, the cable is the most common failure point on a headset, so I wanted to be able to easily replace the cable if necessary.

It's a great headset. Obviously doesn't have the bells and whistles like noise cancelling or surround, but that's not important to me. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and the customisability and replaceability of parts is great (like ear pads and head strap).

4382,"The title is wrong, and not for the fact Holland was mentioned but the way it was mentioned. Because when you  write a location like this you first mention the smallest location (usually a street or a town) and then mention the bigger locations (usually a region or a country) it lies within to make sure the person reading it doesn't confuse the place for another place. If you just show a picture and say the location is in Holland but don't mention it is in Michigan a lot of people will not know you meant the city in Michigan.

So the thing is, within the Netherlands there's a region you could describes as Holland, which consists of the provinces South-Holland and North-Holland. And by saying the Netherlands after it, with a comma, they specifically state this is in that region. This is however not where this is located since this is in the town of Lemmer in Friesland. So the correct way to say it would be ""Lemmer, the Netherlands"" or ""Friesland, the Netherlands"". But if they would have just said ""Unconventional housing in Holland"" everyone would've understood too, since Holland is an informal name for the country and this is not a formal matter.

- The Estonian word *pisut* (""a bit"") and Finnish word *pisu* (""piss"") are not cognates, yet both have cognates in the other language. The Estonian word *pisut* is a derivation of *pisike* (""small"") and Finnish has the word *piskuinen* (""tiny""). And Estonian also has the word *piss* (""piss""), which I presume is cognate with the Finnish *pisu*. The Estonian word at least is a German or Low German loan.

- The Estonian word *korts* (""wrinkle"") is a Proto-Finnic word, used in some other Finnic languages, but not in Finnish. And the Finnish colloquial word for ""condom"" - *kortsu* is probably derived from the word *kondomi* itself.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/kg57zr/the_difference_between_finnish_and_estonian/ggduf8l/,pagaripiparkook,1608401610

4456,"&gt;Mikrolaineahjus 

Well, it means ""in microwave oven"", the nominative is *mikrolaineahi*

&gt;mikroaaltouuni

Btw, Estonian has a synonym for it derived from Finnish: *mikrouun*.

&gt;säilytä kuivassa paikassa

Estonian could easily use the word *säilitada* as well, although *paigas* would be a bit wrong as it rather means a geographical location than a place in your home.

&gt;Also, their ""next to"" sounds really similar to our ""dick"", so ""can I sit next to you"" etc can be very confusing. 

Do you mean *kyrpä*? Because then the Estonian word would be *kõrval* or in the context of sitting next to someone, would be *kõrvale*.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/kg57zr/the_difference_between_finnish_and_estonian/ggdvo4h/,pagaripiparkook,1608402196

4566,"My favourite bits of Estonian picked up from random food products are ""mikrolaineahjus"" and ""hoida kuivas kohas"". 

Mikrolaineahjus is microwave oven, in Finnish mikroaaltouuni. Laine is also a word for wave in Finnish, but it's a weird poetic word that you'd never see in a technical context. Ahjus sounds like ahjo, which is the hot bit in a blacksmith's forge or some other old timey context. 

""Hoida kuivas kohas"" is ""keep in a dry place"", in Finnish ""säilytä kuivassa paikassa"". Hoida is a word in Finnish, but means something more like maintaining or taking care of. Kohta is a word in Finnish, but normally means something like a spot on an object or something rather than a location that a thing can be in. I can't explain it properly, but thinking about it hurt my brain a bit. 

Also, their ""next to"" sounds really similar to our ""dick"", so ""can I sit next to you"" etc can be very confusing.

I think the best translation is innostunut. But it's not used in the same context so often. ""Oletko innostunut""? Are you excited? I dont think it's the same and no one really says it like that.

That's not actually true. According to China's own data 600 million Chinese make less than $140 USD a month. With a further 360 million making less than $240.

Also: Obligatory reminder that the Chinese weren't lifted out of poverty by their government. It's the government who put them there and the Chinese people lifted themselves out of poverty once the CCP stopped fucking up even more and took a step back.

Put it this way - imagine you’re 16 years old fresh out of school and you and your mates have been conscripted into the army. You’ve just spent the last 4 months living in what essentially is a muddy ditch barely held up by wooden planks. You’ve got lice, because you haven’t washed in weeks, you don’t sleep because of fear being eaten alive by rats the size of terriers or being clubbed to death by a German with a shovel in a night raid. You’ve seen your friends lose their minds, and get shot for cowardice, have their heads exploded in front of you from a German sniper and been mown down by machine guns. In the morning there’s a chance you, and everyone else you’ve grown up with has to climb over the top and march through barbed wire, mines and machine gun fire under the orders of a man sitting 10km back in a French chateau who’s entire tactical understanding is based on a war that happened a hundred years ago.

Same goes for the Sigmund Freud Museum, which is a pretty cool museum though. What i would totally recommend is the Zentralfriedhof (Cemetery) and if you are into Music, the Musican Appartements are cheaper and often more in its original state. My favorite was the Hayden House. Also whats interesting is Grinzing, just a bit out you got beautiful landscapes with typical Austrian restaurants and wine. I could go on for eternity.

5103,"&gt;Germany started as Germany on Oct 3 1990 much later than you expected

No. It was called a ***re-***unification for a reason. The name and concept for ""Germany"", no, rather, Deutschland, for this country, in its shape as a unified country of germanic people was first used in the Deutscher Bund which is the direct basis for the Germany we have today.

&gt;Katharina was born in a German family as most were German not Prussians, the last being already assimilated to Germans by 17th century Prussian doesn’t refer from then on to folk that spoke old Prussian but to Germans and lands previously inhabited by Prussians.

You do realize there is a very significant difference between ""german"" as in 'a person from the country Germany' and ""germanic"" right? German as an ethnic and national identity does not really exist as a broad concept before the early 19th century.

&gt;Die Vorstellung einer ethnisch-kulturellen Einheit der Deutschen ist ab **etwa Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts,** seit den Freiheitskriegen gegen die napoleonische Herrschaft, die wichtigste Grundlage deutscher Nationskonzepte. Da kein deutscher Nationalstaat existierte, konstituierte sich das Konzept der Volksgemeinschaft nicht über einen Staat, sondern über Vorstellungen kultureller (insbesondere auch sprachlicher) Identität und gemeinsamer Abstammung.

That is literally the reason why there was a German question to begin with. 

So no. Catherine was born into the House of Anhalt-Zerbst, a Fürstentum loosely associated with the Holy Roman Empire (as most Fürstentümer were at the time, which is why on every single map this subreddit loves to post of that time period the Holy roman empire is an eyesore of associated autonomous principalities instead of a solid nation like literally everything else around it). Not into ""Germany"". She was of germanic ancestry yes, but that is insofar irrelevant as it's more an association of language rather than nationality. Which by the way includes every facette of germanic languages, so you find ""germanic"" people everywhere marked [here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanische_Sprachen#/media/Datei:Germanische_sprachen.PNG) which should explain why this is an absolute nonsense metric to use.

&gt;Being German but cooking in Russia doesn’t make you a Russian cook. At least not that straightforward.

No. But speaking a germanic language makes you germanic. Which  is exactly why it is stupid.

&gt;I wasn‘t any moment talking about 1778. Why would I? What happened?

Go ahead and reread your first reply to me.

&gt;Because there was no Germany? Call her Saxon then.

Yes. That is exactly what she is.

&gt;For my knowledge a generous lump of central europe was and is inhabited by germanic people. 

Yes. But as we established, Germanic =/= german =/= Germany.

As for Skylon you need a lot more fuel to get that into orbit and back. So to get the same amount of payload up there you need a lot more total fuel. With synthetic fuel you need energy to create it and because Skylon is a lot less efficient you need more energy for it. Now its supposed to be fully reusable which is an advantage. It claims to carry 11 tons to the iss but i believe that when i see it.

Shit you posted a)    
In a recent [study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/4/832/htm) on Vegan (VN), Vegetarian (VG) and Omnivorous (OM)  

This study allows children to eat ""prohibited"" food 1x per week, is based on parents declarations only and does not exclude breast milk. With adult vegans top issues to health come up after 2-3 years of total vegan diet unless they cheat from time to time.   
[a)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/6io4b6/my_health_issues_after_3_years_vegan/) [b)](https://www.healthline.com/health/i-started-eating-meat-after-being-vegan)   
I find this as an example of a few flaws in determining that its safe (but sure, if its repeatable with... but it was not repeated right? Otherwise you would post a meta-analysis). 

Shit you bosted b) 

 *We observed a lower consumption of refined carbohydrates, fried foods, alcohol and foods high in free sugars* 

Therefore

 *These findings* ***suggest that non-meat-eaters might be consuming an overall “healthier” diet than meat-eaters.*** 

This study shows that vegans eat less shitty food, booze and sugar (yep, those are unhealthy), nothing more. Not suprising that people who plan their diet in advance also eat healthier **You literally could not bother to read the fragment you posted yet have the audacity to spam my inbox twice.** 

Remember, its coming from the topic of actual scientifically backed claim that you can obtain good quality protein easier from meat. Total offtopic on your side with stuff you did not bother to read before posting. 

Now - I could go to google and find ""health dangers of veganism"", then repost entire 1-3 pages to waste your time like you did mine but you dont seem to be a reading type.

u/Whydowesuffer you may now kiss the bride, you did not read his post either. 

Also no - this does not mean I dont care about carbon footprint or say that we should not reduce our consumption (but I would not mind if vegan preachers could take financial responsibility for people who believe them for more than 2-3 years). Not saying its impossible to survive like that with just the right dose of supplements - saying its impossible for a wider population to do that and you are more likely to get hurt than succeed, with neglibly better carbon footprint than eating meat/eggs every 2 weeks (which is vegan according to your shit a) study so you should be fine with it).

The redditor who was suffering made a fine comment that im going to leave with you.

Reading problems sound familiar.

5373,"With nearly a week delay (sry was busy) 

&gt;  I feel like SSTO would be much better than launching rockets

SSTO means Single Stage To Orbit and that is primarily a rocket that has only one stage. Skylon as a Spaceplane is also somewhat of a rocket and its ssto because it has only one stage.

To reach orbit you need to reach a speed of roughly 7km/s to go higher you need even more speed. For that you need to carry a lot of fuel. **For every KG of weight you can save, you either gain an extra kilogram of payload**. Alternatively you save the fuel to carry that kg, the fuel to carry the other fuel and the weight of the structure to contain the fuel. All in all you save a lot of fuel. Now staging does exactly that. It removes a lot of dead weight from your rocket and thus with the same size of rocket you have many times the payload mass. Many times the payload means a fraction of the cost per kg payload and that is what customers are paying for. 

This is even worse for reusable rockets. If you are reusable, you also need to carry the fuel to get you out of orbit and you need to carry that all the way to orbit. You also need a heat shield for a much bigger vehicle. Meaning you will loose even more payload and the maximum orbit you can reach will drop significantly. 


Now the SABRE engine is awesome and i believe it will be used for lowerstages as it is better than a normal rocket lower stage, however SSTOs are soo bad, that skylon will actually be worse than a normal rocket.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/kbw45z/skylon_ssto_spaceplane/ggb9npu/,aullik,1608338370

5555,"&gt; I see. So, it is a kind of idea behind the current resolution, not ever mentioned by it: 'if Russia is speaking about Nazis, let us speak about KGB'.

I'm not sure if you are trolling or just don't understand what I mean. I literally quoted parts of the resolution that oppose the banning symbols of the USSR (due to being associated with the victory over Nazism). Similarly for the other parts. It's roughly all point 23 till 28 or something like that.

I'm not saying ""Wow, you can't condemn Nazism without also speaking about Stalinism or such"". I did not add anything about Stalinism or such. Yet the text of the resolution also includes opposition to a ban of symbols of the USSR, opposition to demolishing symbols of the USSR, opposition to pointing out war crimes of the USSR etc.

In fill it would be better to call the resolution: 'Combating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance while simultaneously preventing criticism of the victors and whitewashing Stalinist/Allied atrocities.'",Hesse (Germany),/r/europe/comments/kfgsfu/us_and_ukraine_vote_against_antinazi_resolution/ggafdpk/,MilkaC0w,1608322780

Second: IDK if crapy stories may be ethically compared at all, but USSR wasn't even far from the shit made by allies of Nazi. No burning villages, no Zyklon B, no Unit 731. It was not even USSR that did the most insane acts of Allies (like Drezden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki).

Mixing Nazi and USSR together looks more like  an intensional blocking the discussions.

1.Tibet was not a Chinese province. It was a seperate frontier territory that was administered seperately from China. Tibet was an area under the Qing as was China. They were both under the Qing, but not together otherwise. Tibet was also for all intents de facto independent at this time. 2. The Qing were also Manchus not Chinese.

It was not supposed to emulate a mini Yugoslavia, Bosnia belongs to its citizens in its borders which have been pretty much the same for centuries, saying anything else is both insensitive and incorrect.  


The country's anthem was stripped off its text because of the politics Bosnian Serbs supported back then, which was basically to halt any progress and recognition of the country in the first post-war years, in hopes that it will vanish and the aggression and genocide by their leaders would be rewarded with an ethnically clean part of B&amp;H to be subsequently annexed by Serbia. Once they found out it won't work due to many internal and external factors they started working together and now all 3 ethnic groups are actually committed to progressing to the EU.  


Strasbourg rulings in cases of Roma, Jew and minority representation on the national level as well as being able to run for power as a Serb in FBiH and as a non-Serb in RS are being implemented through the same Dayton changes that politicians agree on, the election law that will stop Bosniaks from potentially overvoting ethnic Croats on their presidency member has been agreed on by both parties and the Mostar elections will finally happen in 2 days after 12 years.

&gt;(...) But I'm skeptical about the entire map, to be honest. I haven't found any proper reference about it online, only posts on social medias and such.

&gt;The only Portuguese map dated to 1573 is the [Teixera planisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teixeira_planisphere).

They didn't draw conclusions, they didn't suggest a course of action.

You can say that the premise is suggestive, but that's the worse you can say about it.


&gt; I am not against balancing our meals I am against hard-core environmentalists and vegans waging war on people eating meat, not turning off the water while brushing your teeth, watering your lawn, etc. when the reality is that those sacrifices mean a lot to us but mean very very little to stopping climate change

Vegetarians and vegans are raising the question of ""how much our food really cost"". And they show you how bad it is. That doesn't mean go from 100 to 0 grams of meat in your diet. It's goal is to get you to think, do you really need to eat that much meat. Or is it just indulgence at this point?

Vegans are notoriously mocked for their guilt tripping approach. Some of them are assholes with superiority complex, though most aren't. You shouldn't label an entire group of people based on its most annoying, but vocal minority.

&gt; When we get 100% of our energy from clean energy like nuclear and renewables, and we've gone from driving petrol and diesel cars to driving electric and hydrogen

Climate change isn't a magic figure of CO2, that we have to go under. Climate change is a side effect of our progress. We've progressed so much, that we're starting to destroy our own environment. We're using our limited (for the time being) resources in an unsustainable way.

That's why a way to combat climate change is to change the energy sources (non-renewable to renewable).

But an equally valid way is to prolong the use of items by repair or at worst - recycling.

&gt; I am going to start sacrificing the way I live for the planet.

You never had, you just want to find a justification and sleep easier at night. You're not alone in this. Lots of people take it as a personal attack and feel offended by the idea, that they in some way are responsible for anything beyond their person.

Though by taking this personally, you're doing the business, in general, a favor. The largest polluters in the world are the business ventures extracting, processing or converting resources.

Next time someone talks about climate change, don't take it personally and don't think they want to take meat out of your mouth.

We should not think about individual products or foods but about our dietary habits holistically and how they supply us. Looking at food in an isolated manner is not helpful, a liver for example can not be directly replicated from plants and the nutrition from beans cannot be replicated by muscle flesh. You have to consider the entire diet and how individual pieces work together within it.

I try to make people understand that eating animal products first isn't necessary for survival. Plant-based diets can supply us with everything we need. And then, second, I try to explain how our taste buds work. That they're adaptive, change with what we eat. In other words, we can train them. And that one isn't giving up taste or enjoyment from food when making a switch towards plant-based diets, even if one thinks so at first.

Good cooking skills, herbs and spices, colour, texture, use of seasoning, fat, salt, sweeteners etc. are what's behind really tasty meals (those are basic cravings we have).
