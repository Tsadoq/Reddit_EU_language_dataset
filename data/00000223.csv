1,"What I always wonder about these things is who's doing the trash producing. I mean, we have the same kinds of bins as other Europeans so it's not like we can stuff more in them than other people can, and our products use the same kinds of packaging etc. 

Is it just all down to industry I wonder, because I don't see where the extra trash would come from if we're talking about the average person. It's not like our pizzas are ""more packaged"" than they are elsewhere for example. What would the extra trash be?

And what kind of trash is it? That makes a huge difference. If it's things that will just be recycled then it's not a big problem but if it's all plastics going to get burned or whatever that's pretty bad. Just having more trash being collected can simply be *due* to more recycling or less trash being thrown in nature for example. 

I don't really find these sorts of rankings all that useful to be honest. The more a country tries to get people to not litter etc. the more will end up in bins and thus in the trash being collected. So not littering will show up as a negative on such a ranking because it'll lead to more trash being collected by the municipality.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/951z3o/municipal_waste_generation_in_eu_countries_in_2017/e3qv5bt/,Dnarg,1533617937

Stating a belief in a poll doesn't mean the person will actually follow-up that belief and behave that way in their everyday life.

The statement by EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini and the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France and Germany said it would also work to keep ""effective financial channels"" open with Iran.

""We deeply regret the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S., due to the latter's withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),"" the statement issued in Brussels said.

The EU said it would now swiftly bring in legal cover for firms in the 28-nation bloc to work with Iran, after the Trump administration rejected European calls for an exemption.

""We are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran,"" the statement added.

""This is why the European Union's updated Blocking Statute enters into force on 7 August to protect EU companies doing legitimate business with Iran from the impact of U.S. extra-territorial sanctions.""

The ""blocking statute"" forbids EU firms from complying with U.S. sanctions, allowing them to recover damages from such penalties and nullifying any foreign court rulings against them.

French carmaker Renault, which does not sell cars in the U.S., has said it will remain in Iran despite the sanctions. But French oil group Total and carmaker PSA have already indicated they are likely to pull out of Iran.

Despite the U.S. move to restore the sanctions, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reaffirmed in Alaska late Sunday, the Europeans said they would continue to work with Iran to preserve the deal.

""The remaining parties to the JCPOA have committed to work on, inter alia, the preservation and maintenance of effective financial channels with Iran, and the continuation of Iran's export of oil and gas,"" it said.

73,"&gt; You're confusing Cyprus with Greek mainland or Crete. Only thing happened was, Ottoman forces attacking to Cyprus and the archbishop that chosen to not be part of the Greek Revolt have been hanged. That wasn't intercommunal violence or violence between Greek Orthodox Cypriots and Muslim Cypriots. Nice fallacy try at the end by the way.

What actually had happened was Ottoman forces from Syria landed on the island with the Pasha of Cyprus saying ""I intend to kill every greek on the island"" and thousands of  Greeks were massacred, entire villages were destroyed, church properties were ransacked by Turkish cypriot mobs, clergymen were hanged, and there was mass looting. *even when* orders from the grand vizier ordered such actions to stop, *turkish cypriots* and Ottoman officials on the island continued them. So no I am not confusing the Greek mainland with Cyprus, Greeks everywhere in the Empire were targeted, including even as far as the levant, cyprus is no exception 

I don't know if you seriously believe what you are saying or trying to lie to push your agenda, but I teach this stuff for a living, I am not some average uninformed westerner you can lie to. If you are just this poorly informed about the history of your own home, I would ask you open a book before making such absurd statements as ""inter-communal tensions didn't exist""


&gt; Lol, that's why, even during the heist of the Orthodox and Muslim clashes in Balkans and Anatolia, nothing between the communities happened in Cyprus?

It did happen, you are just lying saying it didn't happen, wilfully, or out of ignorance. 


&gt; You've invented Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot tensions and the very violence between the communities and encouraged it. I think I was pretty clear about it, but you seem to be the last context bender 

tensions  existed prior 

&gt; Mate, there wasn't an issue during the Ottoman times in the island between communities, but there were tensions between the Ottoman rule and locals, no matter the religion. I'd blame your disgusting empire instead, since that's where the blame lies. The tensions between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots also have nothing to do with the stuff you're pointing out, sorry. Again, nice attempt though.

Sure if you ignore the measures of collective punishment, massacres, looting, tyranny and subjugation the Greeks had to endure at the hands of the Ottoman state and Turkish cypriots themselves. yeah everything was swell!


&gt; The tensions between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots also have nothing to do with the stuff you're pointing out

It absolutely does, nice attempt though.

Perhaps what the British Empire can be blamed for is the introduction of actual freedom on the island which allowed such ideas like Esnois to spread in the first place. I will concede that the British administration took advantage of these tensions to maintain control of the island, and certainly didn't do much of anything to help the situation, but to say it was *invented* by the British is utter nonsense. Let us say the year is 1880, and the british have just decided to leave the island, completely alone, are you suggesting the Greeks and Turks of the island would sit down and come to some sensible agreement to the benefit of both communities, this kind of fantasy belongs in a Tolkien story, you lot would have armed yourselfs and got to killing same as everywhere else in the Ottoman sphere before the British forces boarded their ships.",United Kingdomer currently teaching in the U.S | BREXITEER ,/r/europe/comments/94z5ge/erdogan_closing_net_on_turkish_cypriots/e3qwlro/,TheBritishHistorian,1533620015

* The US does have a history of taking in people with religious beefs with their government.  This was a pretty minor beef IMO, but…

* On the specific issue of homeschooling, there is some considerable domestic support, mostly from people who want more religious education than the public schools offer.  There were people batting for him politically who care a lot about the issue and have pull.

* The mother had already had one baby on US soil, who would be a citizen.

* The number of people doing so wasn't large — one family — and by simply choosing to suspend rather than issuing a favorable ruling, they didn't open any large gateway for migration.  Looking online, it looks like there have been some unsuccessful efforts at creating room for small amounts of immigration.  The organization in question tried (unsuccessfully) to open 500 slots a year for homeschoolers who had been punished by their governments for homeschooling in their countries.

* He was apparently not given a green card, which means that while any more babies he has will be US citizens, unless there's some further special action, he doesn't have a route to citizenship himself or for his first six children: they cannot draw from welfare.  I wouldn't be surprised if he gets help from a religious group or similar.

Really? Because last time I checked thousands of Greeks were put to death, mobs of muslims attacked their clergy and butchered them and they were greatly subjected, entire villages destroyed and burnt down...

No it wasn't stop with this madness.

Here is a way to check if colonialism == capitalism.

**Did only capitalist countries do colonialism?**

To answer that, we need to know what colonialism is. Google says:

&gt;colonialism


&gt;the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country, occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically.

Well then! Let's see if we can discover a few colonial states before capitalism reared its ugly head in the, let's be generous, later half of the 16th century.

[New Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain) was established in 1521. That sure looks earlier than capitalism. Peru was conquered in 1524 too.

But maybe you say, whatever, proto-capitalism was already in place.

Okey! So let's go a bit further back. Middle of the 10th century. Did anyone ever do any colonialism? [Yep, sure did!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostsiedlung) 

But hey, they still had mercantilism back then. And as we all know, mercantilism is basically capitalism but like, different.

Fine fine. Let's go even further back. Let's grab a millitary dictatorship with priest-monarchs who famously liked to fight naked. That's right, [this is Sparta!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Spartan_colonies)

But, you say, all these are reactionaries. Communism would *never* do that.

[Except unfortunately they did.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_settlements_in_the_Soviet_Union)

&gt;At the same time, involuntary settlement played a role in the colonization of remote areas of the Soviet Union. This role was specifically mentioned in the first Soviet decrees about involuntary labor camps.

269,"&gt; No amount of hard work warrants such disparity

Well, first, those are examples of particularly well-to-do entertainers.  Second, it's not really a measurement of hard work (though I suspect that people who do this probably have worked hard).  Typically their brand is worth a lot — they have a lot of ability to sell a product.  That's hard to replace.

If people in Country X will buy $N million more product because the specific person endorses or is in the product, then it's worth paying 'em up to that.  For better or for worse, lots of consumers become attached to celebrities.

If I want to be a top pro athlete, or the actress that's the star of an international blockbuster, there just aren't that many slots.  A lot of people are going to try for it, and not many will get that point.  So it's a risky undertaking.  And you're being compensated for that risk.  I dunno, what's the expected return of a would-be great rap artist?  Sure, if they hit the very top, they do very well.  But the vast bulk won't.  Whereas if you, I dunno, become a mechanical engineer, you will not make $100 million (barring starting some sort of new company around some amazing new invention or something).  But you also have a lot of certainty that you'll do *reasonably* well.  A mechanical engineer can expect to make [about $4 million in total over his lifetime](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/high-lifetime-earnings) in the US.  And unlike that rap artist, he can be confident of pulling about that.

If you said ""rap artists should be compensated as mechanical engineers are"", then you're refusing to pay rap artists for their risk.  It doesn't take too many unsuccessful rap artists to make the expected return for a rap artist look pretty unsatisfying compared to that mechanical engineer.  My guess is that the expected lifetime earnings of someone entering a mechanical engineering career are considerably better than those of someone entering a rap artist career.

""But maybe I want to be a rap aritist and have a low-risk, low income option.""

Well, that can be done via creating companies full of rap artists on contract.  But AFAIK, there isn't a lot of uptake for that.  Maybe that already happens to some degree.  I don't know much about the economics of the field, but it [sounds like](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/09/15/551236508/episode-794-how-to-make-it-in-the-music-business) certain areas, like songwriting, do do that.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/954pqf/alex_jones_getting_covered_on_the_danish_news/e3qjyw6/,vokegaf,1533605743
270,"LGBT rights are a human rights issue. Of course they get involved in that. But they are not supposed to get involved in supporting a particular political party or policies not related to human rights. They have even publicly opposed Brexit, something that is very far out of their area. Most human rights groups have become political parties masquerading as human rights groups.

These groups claim to be apolitical:

&gt;Is Amnesty International political?

&gt;Amnesty International has no political affiliation, endorses no political party, accepts no funds from governments or any political party. Amnesty International is independent of any government, political persuasion or religious creed. It does not support or oppose any government or political system, nor does it support or oppose the views of the victims whose rights it seeks to protect. It is concerned solely with the protection of the human rights involved in each case, regardless of the ideology of the government, opposition forces or the beliefs of the individual. Its independence is recognised through its observer status with the United Nations and regional inter-governmental organisations. Amnesty International does not grade countries according to their human rights record; instead of attempting comparisons it concentrates on trying to end specific violations of human rights.

AI has been hijacked by Islamists and spends most of its time demonising Israel and the USA rather than fighting for human rights. [Their communication director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_Saeed) literally says he supports Sharia law becoming the law of the land in the UK, and he ran for British parliament on this platform. He formerly worked for Al Jazeera, the media outlet of a country that kills gays. Dont you think it's a little odd these are the sort of people working for international human rights groups? More people ought to know about this. AI gets away with a lot of things because they claim they will stand up for anyone who is being oppressed, even if it's a Nazi. In fact one of their founders was a former Nazi collaborator who also led the IRA.

&gt; Here is a 4th map from him I post here in these comments - his work which got him to fame, the world map of 1569 - Again, you can read Armenia where it would be Eastern Anatolia today.

If you look closely at the map, Turcoma, aka Turkey is also mentioned over the Mesopotamian Plateau. So again, it is also Turkish. You are simply providing evidence of my point, that it was either referred to as just Turkey, or Turkey and Armenia, and it was only with the rise of nationalism that it came to be refereed to exclusively by Turkey. 

Then, in reference to all of your responses to my map, you just proved my point further. Turcomania and Armenia are co-named in the same area, and if it is simplified Armenia is left off.. Thus the most correct terminology of this era would be Turcomania, although Armenia is not wrong. Of course since in modern parlance, Anatolia is equivocated with Turkey, so saying Eastern Anatolia is really not that incorrect, it is just using modern terms instead of Turcomania. 

And just for the record, here is the source of the ""unsourced version""
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/1730_Seutter_Map_of_Turkey_%28Ottoman_Empire%29%2C_Persia_and_Arabia_-_Geographicus_-_MagniTurcarum-seutter-1740.jpg

&gt; I have no idea why you are deflecting towards the Armenian Genocide or the modern Karabakh conflict but I won't be playing along.

Is it wrong to use a modern name? Must I refer to Bezdor, formerly known as Lachin and founded as Abdallyar by its different names depending on the era which I am talking about. By calling it Lachin am I denying the Artsakh right to autonomy, by calling it Bezdor am I calling for ethnic cleansing? Your entire argument is based off of anger that Eastern Turkey today is not called Western Armenia. Otherwise we couldnt refer to Armenia as Armenia for the previous ethnic cleansing mentioned. So therefor it is perfectly valid to point out that even in the era Turcomania was more correct. ",USA! USA!

&gt;Eternal life traditionally refers to continued life after death, as outlined in Christian eschatology. The Apostles' Creed testifies: ""I believe... the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting."" In this view, eternal life commences after the second coming of Jesus and the resurrection of the dead, although in the New Testament's Johannine literature there are references to eternal life commencing in the earthly life of the believer, possibly indicating an inaugurated eschatology.
&gt;
&gt;According to mainstream Christian theology, after death but before the Second Coming, the saved live with God in an intermediate state, but after the Second Coming, experience the physical resurrection of the dead and the physical recreation of a New Earth. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states, ""By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our body, transformed by reunion with our soul. Just as Christ is risen and lives for ever, so all of us will rise at the last day."" [4] N.T. Wright argues that ""God's plan is not to abandon this world... Rather, he intends to remake it.

5: Money is power. Germany basically funds the EU alongside France.

6: No, that is not specific

7: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact#Criticism

I am very familiar with the topic of the article you are linking. Wikipedia however is not a good source. The article provides some links to other articles that are better sources for example: 

&gt;The German government admitted for the first time on Wednesday that it would probably breach EU budget guidelines this year, and France, Italy and Portugal are believed to be in a similar position.
&gt;
&gt;Politicians around Europe have for years called for amendments to the so-called ""stability and growth pact"" budget rules, but Brussels has resisted change. 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2336823.stm

I am not agreeing that this is an example of Germany changing the rules.

Can you provide your reasoning in your own words?

 This seems - at best - an example of Germany avoiding being punished (when no one else had been punished for this ever) and later the rules where changed because several countries including Germany thought they should be changed. 

For these changes the regular EU process (not some special German power) was used, can you describe that process?

If you just keep insulting them and anyone who ""dared"" to vote for them, by calling them idiots, racists, etc. they will keep winning.

&gt; These included many of today's ""populist"" leaders who offer a mix of authoritarian rule and exclusionary politics repackaged as a vision for a brave new world: walls in place of globalisation, muscular diplomacy in place of multilateralism, ""my country first"" in place of free trade and protectionist or even social-nationalist measures to tame neoliberalism.

And this shows how out of touch you can be. Borders? Pfff, who needs them. Putting the country you were chosen to represent first? Naaah...

&gt; And so, after years in which voting seemed to have become an impotent choice between identical products, for many it was finally right-wing populism that restored weight to the electoral ballot.

&gt;You're talking about selective legal migration (plus rigid laws and harsh penalties). Not uncontrolled illegal migration from war torn countries where extremism abounds, and a very lax and generous system.

I totally agree, people coming from war torn countries will be more extremist. So why not argue that point instead of making it seem like Islam is inherently the problem? That is the point I am arguing. It's nothing wrong with muslims, its just that the people who are immigrating to western europe and forced to leave their home countries are refugees.

There is a reason that the Iranians in Europe are so high performing while basically all other refugee groups aren't and I believe it is because Iranians didn't flee because their house got bombed but because their liberties were taken.

MRI - New kids on the block.

This is why every infantry section carries the whole spectrum of light and heavy weapons with them from small firearms to recoilless rifles.

If case is obvious, sure, but:
&gt;As far as I understand, the man was caught on camera when putting the banner on the statue, was he not?
It isn't illegal, profanation of a monument is. Judge must decide if the monument was profaned. Let's say we have Polish Independence Day and someone puts Polish flag at monument of someone important. Would be that monument profaned? Not really, but both in that hypothetical case and the reported one someone put a piece of cloth on a monument. Judge must decide if that was illegal.

&gt;Regarding your comment about 'bosses', seems a bit conspiratory to me. Is the police not to be trusted in Poland? 

That gives me interesting perspective, because of I don't think that I know a single person in Poland who doubts that it sometimes works like that.

Yes, why do you think I don't know this?

I dont really think them having harsch punishments is the reason Singapore is thriving as a multicultural society and it's actually a really bold claim to make. I guess you have some kind of sources?

My own opinion is that everyone who lives in Singapore is a Singaporean and everyones culture is respected. China town, Arab street etc. cant exist in a European society because people think seeing something that is not in their native tounge is ""killing society"". 

It's literally a melting pot of cultures and no matter if it's ex-pats, chinese, malays, indians or arabs they are all hard working. They have taken the best of each culture to make a better one.

916,"The old republic was often portrayed as a lion (with a birth defect)

[Leo Belgicus](https://i.imgur.com/ewnvIbh.jpg)

&gt;The Leo Belgicus (Latin for Belgic Lion) was used in both heraldry and map design to symbolize the former Low Countries (current day Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium and a small part of northern France) with the shape of a lion

&gt;The earliest Leo Belgicus was drawn by the Austrian cartographer Michaël Eytzinger in 1583, when the Netherlands were fighting the Eighty Years' War for independence. The motif was inspired by the heraldic figure of the lion, occurring in the coats of arms of several of the Netherlands, namely: Brabant, Flanders, Frisia, Guelders, Hainaut, Holland, Limburg, Luxembourg, Namur and Zeeland, as well as in those of William of Orange.

&gt;Eytzinger's map was the first of many. There were three different designs. In the most common one, the lion's head was located in the northeast of the country and the tail in the southeast. The most famous version is that of Claes Janszoon Visscher, which was published in 1609 on the occasion of the Twelve Years' Truce. A less common design reversed the position of the lion, as shown in the Leo Belgicus by Jodocus Hondius.

&gt;The third version was published in the later stages of the war, and after the independence of the Dutch Republic was confirmed in the Peace of Westphalia (1648). It is called the Leo Hollandicus, the Holland Lion, and shows only the province of Holland. One of the earliest versions was published by Visscher around 1625.

The Americans believe that we control them illegally and undeservedly because, in their view, we do not use them as they ought to be used.""[10]

&gt; Patrushev also referenced ""Madeleine Albright’s claim 'that neither the Far East nor Siberia belong to Russia.'"" According to the New York Times, there is no official record of Albright having made such a remark. Instead, it can be traced back to a psychic employed by the FSB who claimed to have read the thoughts in Albright's mind while in a state of trance.[11][12]

939,"Sure. I'll just mention a few things that come to mind. Most of the things I'll say should probably be limited to comparisons with Western/Northern Europe. 

Science:

In the US, there really is a lot of opportunity for someone with a lot of ambition. For example, as a scientist, it seems likely you'd be better off in the US. The [US leads the world in terms of scientific impact](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fveloso/useuscience.pdf), specifically over the EU-15, despite a smaller population. Most of the world's highest ranked universities also are in the US. Of course, someone with EU citizenship can also work as a scientist in the US and attend these top-ranked universities, but it's harder.

Nature/Density:

The US's population density is 32.8/km\^2. The EU's is 117.3/km\^2. The EU is a lot, lot more developed and there's far less nature here compared to the US, especially if we're talking about Western Europe. The US has an extensive park system and is full of very large, natural spaces that have been mostly undeveloped by man. To a lot of people, this sort of space and nature is extremely important. Of course, the EU features a lot of amazing nature of its own--but it's not comparable, in the end. (Especially if you factor in Canada, which American citizens can visit without restriction). 

These density figures aren't just because America has large open, uninhabited spaces--the spaces that are inhabited also tend to be less dense. In Europe, you tend to live in towns closely with others. In the US, your house can sit on its own plot of land in relative isolation. This has a lot of negatives in regards to efficiency, public transport, etc. But it also has a lot of positives for people--as someone who currently lives in a small apartment on a German street lined with house after house after house, I often miss the freedom/open space of American suburbia and how calm and quiet it was. I find European density almost claustrophobic and anxiety-inducing.

Food:

The US has insane variety in cuisine that is unlike anything I've experienced in Europe. The quality in Europe and food regulations are almost certainly better, but if you're in a given European country, say, German, the food experience will be \*distinctly\* German--this is especially true when shopping at a market, etc. In the US, there is far, far more variety in this regard due its insane cultural diversity. 

Consumer goods:

Things are cheap in America. Electronics in particular. The selection also tends to be greater than in Europe (see, e.g. [Amazon.](https://Amazon.om)com vs. [Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de)).  America is also usually favored in terms of digital services (see Netflix in America vs Netflix in, say, Denmark)--although this is almost certainly a symptom of most digital services like this originating in the US. :) 

Salaries:

[Americans make more money on average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage) (both PPP and Nominal). Of course they also tend to work more and have fewer days off.

Start-ups n' stuff:

There is (far) more venture capital and more intellectual capital in the US (due to the aforementioned concentration of great universities).

Military opportunity:

If you want to have a military life (not for everyone, sure), the US is probably a great place to have that. There is insane opportunity in the US military. If you want, to say, be a military pilot, the US is essentially the \*only\* modern country where this is a realistic goal (and not one down to sheer luck of the draw) and where you can actively carve yourself a path to make this a reality (i.e., by attending the US Air Force or Naval academies). 

Of course, the United States has all sorts of problems as we all know and many of the things I mentioned may be seen as negatives (i.e. the plight of consumerism). 

I think it's important to realize that the human experience in a country is far more than just numbers and facts and someone who has just read about the US on Reddit really doesn't have a good understanding of what daily American life is like, and this is also true for Europe.

When I read about (Western/Northern) Europe on a strictly fact this-and-that basis, I'm \*extremely\* compelled to conclude that Europe is simply better. Who doesn't like a comfortable, safe life with your basic needs guaranteed by the government? But my personal experience in living in both places hasn't reflected this.

I've spent about half my life in Europe and half my life in America (slightly longer in Europe), broken up pretty evenly by age (i.e. I moved back and forth quite a lot). I've lived in eight different states, on both coasts, and in the middle of the US. I've lived in six different Western and Northern European countries. 

So I've had considerable experience in both places and I have to say that my life was often better in the United States than in Europe and I felt much happier. This hasn't uniformly been the case--I feel very positively about my experiences in the United Kingdom and of Denmark, but I, for example, found Germany to be an extremely unhappy and depressive place (I'm a German citizen, let me shit on my own country). Even if it has better public transport, free education and healthcare, better roads, etc. None of these objectively better things matter in one's emotional feeling towards a country--and that feeling has a huge influence on one's happiness. 

Europe also tends to be culturally alienating to immigrants. I feel this is especially true in places like Germany and Scandinavia. There is a distinct social isolation that exists in these places whereas America tends to be more welcoming in this regard. Of course this is a natural occurrence when you have an extremely homogeneous, uniform population vs. an extremely diverse one.

As a closing thought, I should mention that I'm a middle/upper-middle class American and in America, your experience is completely dependent upon your socioeconomic status. It's easy to think that America is a shithole and I often find myself thinking that too, especially when browsing /r/europe. But there are a lot of great, wonderful things about the US as well that go beyond the bounds of facts and figures.

My parents (who have paid a lot of taxes in both the US/Europe) has basically told me it's a non-issue and you're essentially exempted via paying your taxes in the country you're currently residing. If that country has very low/no taxes (like some Arab countries), I hear it sucks because then you're basically paying full US taxes despite not living there, but otherwise my understanding is that it's mostly inconsequential. But, feel free to correct me if this isn't the case.

I believe, at least, anything under $100k/year is actually completely excluded. Additionally, any tax you paid to a foreign country on some income can be subtracted from your US taxes. So if you're in a country that taxes higher, I believe you basically end up paying no taxes (which is often the case due to the US's generally low taxes).",,/r/europe/comments/94z1ub/new_eu_citizen_what_are_the_benefits/e3p17hx/,[deleted],1533553501

Or that the M2 Bradley is almost 40 years old, and vastly inferior to something like a Puma?

During the live meeting not a single mention of victims even though deaths had been reported hours earlier and almost 1000 people were still stranded on beaches waiting to be evacuated. It was simply Tsipras asking very stupid questions, which indicated he had not been briefed at all...and the emergency responders telling him everything was under control....meanwhile the fire was still raging.

Ministers and regional governors immediately took to the airways to blame each other and finger point about who was responsible for announcing an evacuation...which in fact, was never fully enacted.

The Chief of Police and Fire Chief went on the offensive claiming they had done everything perfectly....but blamed high winds and global warming.

Everyone started calling for resignations. Tsipras went on air and took ""political responsibility"" which involved....absolutely nothing...just words. A week later, as facts about the gross mismanagement mounted and could not be avoided, resignations started happening.

Meanwhile, the whole country knows there are many contributing factors that need to be addressed, including houses built without permits (decades ago), no city planning, no emergency evacuation plan, emergency IT and comms systems not working or not completed, poor forestry service etc... But as of now the government is only focused on the illegal houses and they're putting on a show by bulldozing a few houses....in other parts of Greece.

The day after the tragedy, the minister of defense visited the area and, surrounded by angry residents, proceeded to blame them for living in houses that were built illegally. But we all know that the houses were legalized through a series of government programs over the past many years.

1157,"&gt; you are intentionally manipulating the way Estonia looks on the map

I am not. I have never been to or near Estonia (or Russia), and I am not interested in Estonian politics in any way. I just work with the available data to create a good visual representation of linguistic minorities.

&gt; They are either with a strong Estonian majority or with a strong Russian majority.

And, instead of having the map full of dots one pixel (or a quarter pixel) in size, I put stripes over the general area where the pixels are concentrated. There's nothing wrong with that.

Based on your logic, almost every striped area on the map should be full of erratically distributed tiny dots, because that's how it usually is if you use a fine enough division.

&gt; You are taking geographically small Russian areas and mixing them with geographically large Estonian areas to make it look like the whole large area is mixed

How do you still not understand that it is completely normal for a symbol on a map to be larger than the thing it represents? Haven't you ever seen a medium scale map with all roads seemingly being kilometres wide because otherwise they would not be visible?

The stripes are a symbol saying ""there is a Russian minority within the area between the lines"".

&gt; your kind of pro-Russian agents

You should see a psychiatrist.

&gt; You are fucking university educated and you don't understand that a map is not supposed to be representative of the quantity of each minority...

Excuse me, but I believe I am the one who made the map, so I decide what it is supposed to represent.

It is supposed to show the location of linguistic minorities. Just like a city on a small scale map is often shown as a large dot covering an area many times its actual size to make it visible (because the dot has a certain predefined size based on legibility criteria), the stripes (which also have a predefined size) may sometimes cover an area larger than the actual spacial distribution of the speakers.

There is nothing wrong with that, as long as they don't visually overrepresent the actual headcount of the minority (which they don't in this case), just like it is OK to use a large dot for a city because the city is disproportionately more important (has a greater population) than the surrounding fields.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/947eo9/father_in_european_languages/e3ouhuo/,jakubmarian,1533539796

&gt;“President Roosevelt will go down to history as one of the greatest of a long line of American presidents, with the unparalleled distinction of having been elected four times as head of the United States,” the taoiseach said.

&gt;“Personally, I regard his death as a loss to the world; for I believe his whole career had shown that he could ultimately be depended upon when this war had ended, to throw his great influence behind, and devote his great energy to the establishment of a world organisation which would be just, and which, being just, could hope to save humanity from recurring calamities like the present war.”

&gt;The Government ordered all flags on Government buildings throughout the country be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect.

1225,"&gt;What? Hungarians, Finns and Estonians are Uralic people..

Yes I know, that was my point. I have talked to Hungarian people on this platform (in their subreddit and on this subreddit) who claim they have nothing to do with Uralic or Altaic people and that they are original peoples of the lands of Hungary, who assimilated the Magyar people and are actually closer to their immediate neighbors than to Central Asian people. Basically the Bulgarian argument as to why a Slavic people call themselves by a Turkic tribe (Bulgar), ""because we assimilated them."" Now hopefully you will see my original post was sarcastic, even has a smiley face at the end. 

I don't know if that is true, but it defeats the purpose especially for Hungarians who speak a **Uralic** language and the fact that they call themselves **Magyarok**. These are the people that they probably descend from -&gt; [Mansi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansi_language). Picture of [Mansi people](http://www.nba.fi/hanti/kuvat1/SUK_36_2_lbox.jpg)

1246,"&gt;European leaders provoke crises and emergencies that they use to seize power from democratic electorates. That has always been their preferred model of continental consolidation. Jean Monnet, one of the E.U.’s founding fathers, was quite open about it. “I have always believed,” he wrote in his memoirs, “that Europe would be built through crises, and that it would be the sum of their solutions.”

That isn't saying that crises were provoked at any point.  All it's saying is that it would be the responses to crises that produced the final system.

&gt;The single currency had already undermined Greece’s prosperity, albeit while making Greeks feel rich. The ability to borrow at rock-bottom interest rates more suitable to venerable corporations in Stuttgart had brought inflationary pressures. 

That required Greece to also *choose* to borrow unwisely.  Lenders look after their own interests, not those of borrowers.

And the idea that this was somehow planned by Germany is, I'd say, silly.  That would be extremely risky, and subject many countries — all of whom participated and had I'm sure had economists review the system and debate its weaknesses — to problems.  There was no secret design that Germany sprang on Greece.  And the outcome of such a failure was unpredictable.

Was the euro system flawed and as a result cause problems for its users?  Sure.  That's not a new phenomenon among currencies.  Did it hurt some countries more than others due to those flaws?  Sure.  Does that mean that flaws were *planned* and disaster intentionally built into the system long ago?  Of course not.

In 1998 the World Trade Organization found the EU's ban was not supported by science and was inconsistent with its WTO obligations, but it remains in place.](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/generalissues/hormonalgrowth/Pages/default.aspx)

[From an article from when Coles introduced its ban](http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-10/vets-attack-coles-over-hormone-added-beef/2662652)

&gt;""They have serious consequences for the animals, for people and for the environment,"" Professor Lean said.
&gt;""I'm concerned consumers may have been scared about their food quality, and we want to assure the consumers their food quality is second to none.
&gt;""For the beef industry the value of the treatments with the growth hormones is around about $210 million a year.
&gt;""If this ban has a flow-on effect and the farmers lose that benefit, it would be the equivalent of wiping out the Queensland cotton crop that was described as a disaster, except this would happen every year.""
&gt;The scientists also argue the decision by Coles threatens the sustainable and ethical production of food.

and in reply

&gt;But Coles spokesman Jim Cooper says this is a spurious claim.
&gt;""I think the idea that all these farmers and pharmaceutical companies are plugging beef with hormone growth promotants because they're worried about the environment is a little bit mischievous,"" he said.
&gt;""They're doing this because they can grow a cow faster and get it to market cheaper.""
Mr Cooper says Coles has never sought to imply that hormone-free beef is safer for consumers.


and in response the them:

&gt;Emeritus Professor Alan Bell, the chief of livestock industries at the CSIRO, vigorously defends the independence of the scientists.
&gt;""Most of us, while we have a strong feeling for the beef industry and want to see it thrive, have no particular commercial axe to grind here,"" he said.
&gt;""Most of us, if not all of us, I doubt have received any funding from the pharmaceutical industries that supply these products, although there has been accusations by Coles that that is the case.""
While Professor Bell says he does not know where the funding for the ad came from, Professor Lean says some of the scientists have made personal contributions to help fund the ad.
He does acknowledge the Animal Health Alliance, which represents the pharmaceutical industry, agreed to underwrite it, and that he and some of the other scientists on the letter have had research partially funded by pharmaceutical companies.

Well that wasn’t the EU’s fault, they have always been honest about the nature of project from the start. Like I have said above the material produced at the time hinted at it going beyond a free trade block.  

&gt;I think the argument there is that the UK always saw the EU as fulfilling a different role to other EU countries.

So yes that is making the UK out to be special and detached from the rest of the EU, no matter how you try to spin it. 

&gt;That comes partially out of WWII and partially out of the UK's broadly global outlook in the 60's and 70's

Britain tried to do more trade and build a closer relationship with the former empire but then it realise that it didn’t work out at the UK became known as the sick man of Europe. So it decided to build closer relationships with its European neighbors.

Even at their peak polling in the 2015 election they only got about 14% of the vote, which is about were AFD is in Germany. With Germany having a more proportional voting system and being considered more pro EU. So it is wrong to use UKIP’s popularity as proof that the referendum was inevitable. 

&gt;when it started taking both Tory and Labour votes

UKIP are far more of a Conservative problem than a Labour one. Labour a strongly leaned towards being in favour of the EU, with about [75% of members wanting a vote on the deal] (https://labourlist.org/2018/01/labour-members-poll-over-75-per-cent-of-want-vote-on-brexit-deal-and-to-stay-in-single-market-and-customs-union/)

&gt;The Euro isn't really structured that way, 

It was clear that there was an inner core of eurozone members while the UK was getting pushed further from onto the sidelines. As the euro is taken up a huge chunk of policy area. That the UK is unable to partake in at best and actively sabotaging at worse. Therefore it would be more conservative if the UK did join. 

&gt;the UK's views on what the EU should be are still somewhat different from other EU members.

My point is that they shouldn’t be and it goes against where I believe that the UK’s best intrests lye. The UK is a European country on par with France and Germany so it should act like it rather than pretend that it is some great power that it only was because of conquering a quater of the world’s landmass. 

&gt;They aren't. Lots of very large countries have almost no influence

Not really, generally the larger the country, the more influence it has in the world and even more so as the world becomes more connected.Organisations like the EU allow even Luxembourg to project its power beyond what it would otherwise be and no I don’t think it makes much sense to project power as UK size when you can be EU size. 

&gt;the UK is not a 'small' country in terms of economic output, military power or influence generally.

It is an increasingly insignificant in the wake of other countries comming to more prominence and as such it makes little sense why such a country should try to make it one its own. Most of the world is completely puzzled by Brexit and for good reason. There is a strong case made for the UK in the euro as well.


&gt;I'm talking about Schengen

Yes and I have said it is even more ridiculous. Saying just because it is is an island when you have members like Malta and Iceland is pathetic excuse beyond belief. 

  &gt;The UK is an Island, so in terms of infrastructure it has almost no impact

Yes it does not only do they have to build additional infrastructure at ferry terminals but the countries around there also have to as well and why La Toquet existed in the first place. It also restricts train services as not only do they need to put in place more infrastructure between Schengen country. It is amazing how people are fine with this nonsense. 

&gt;The UK has regular train and ferry services....

My point is that Iceland and Malta don’t really but they are in Schengen. Just proves how ridiculous this opt out is and it amazes me how it wasn’t debated in parliament but rather just dismissed out of hand. 

&gt;Schengen doesn't get rid of border checks at ports and airports after all, 

In a Schengen country they get treated as domestic so it does make a difference. 

&gt;when it comes to tourism it might have a marginal impact given

The Telegraph did an article claiming [that the under performance is costing the UK £1.2 billion from Asian tourists ] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/09/03/government-must-encourage-chinese-tourists-to-put-uk-on-their-it/) lets not prentend that this doesn’t have a substantial impact. 

&gt;The CTA dealt with the same issue, but between Ireland and the UK, and obviously pre-dates the EU. 

Well just merge CTA with Schengen, like they did with the Nordic Passport Union. It is not an excuse, especially as Ireland was more open to joining Schengen. 

&gt;The argument is that many of the tools that the UK used wouldn't have been available

My argument that those tools didn’t really help the UK that much and as such there isn’t too much harm is getting rid of them. As I mentioned above the intrest rate is rather imprecise and is largely dictated by market trends as such it is not an effective tool. The UK was already an attractive place post crisis, meaning that the investment would come back regardless. Eurozone countries have also recovered at different speeds, proving how ineffective such measures are. The concept of monetary sovereignty gets vastly overstated, in part due to the over reaction of the economic problems in Europe. The countries that joined the euro weren’t stupid, they knew that it was more than worth it to sacrifice independent monetary policy and for good reason at that. 

&gt;wouldn't have been in a position to set interest rates or modify its money supply

There isn’t that much difference between them being controlled by the ECB and the BOE. Especially post independence and to claim so is vastly overstating it. There is a good reason why you can’t just keep on printing money and it is something that the ECB has the ability to do. 


&gt;The UK started a massive QE programme

The ECB has the ability to do that and indeed had a big use of it not that long but it is often not that ineffective so isn’t worth doing much of the time. 

&gt;Leaving the EU and remaining in the Eurozone is clearly not possible though,

I didn’t say it was, what I said it is one thing to leave the EU and quite another to leave the euro. So in that parallel universe where the UK did join the euro I cannot imagine that it would be leaving the EU. For the reasons given above. 

&gt; it is not without its problems either.

I said that people would be left disappointed once Brexit happens and their distrust in politicians with grow. Unlike you I don’t see Britain as an inherently anti EU place but more victim to a multitude circumstances and yes many of the people who voted leave voted for reasons that had nothing to do with the EU. From having nothing to lose to not liking David Cameron and wanting him gone. If you take two major arguments given for leave, sovereignty and immigration, you can see it is clear what that means to people. 

&gt;I think that broadly the EU as a political project simply doesn't work for most people in the UK. 

Blaming that one culture is just wrong, the UK isn’t that much different from other European nation, so it is a bit odd how anti EU sentiment would have so much traction. It seems to me that blaming politicians and the media seems more logical, after all culture is a very elastic thing. I think that if the case was  made well enough, Britain could be very pro EU and it would be a different story. 

&gt;I think that both the UK and EU will benefit far more from being close partners

And I maintain the view that the UK’s best interest would be served in the inner core of the EU for a veraity of reasons. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/94tgku/the_british_euro_what_a_uk_euro_coin_would_have/e3os8ml/,Auckland345,1533535775

1308,"That is not how it works. 
Basic economics: every trade deal is relatively more beneficial for the bigger economy. For Germany, this way, they have access to a market that is nearly as big as the US market in terms of population. They benefit a huge deal with these, they are no angels, they do this because of rational self interest and that’s fine. 

As the german minister one said, from every paid in 10 euros, 9 lands on German products. I’m not sure about how that comes about or the ratio is substantiated, but it clearly shows that Germany has a fair bit of interest in doing this.

In return, Hungary cannot put on tarrifs (forbidden between EU countries), in order to take time to build up its on industry, which can at one time in the future compete with the advanced German or other industries that have been competing in the free market economy for decades, unlike Hungary’s.

This is why China has done what it did. It protected its economy from foreign influence, gained advanced knowledge by inviting in some companies and stole the rest of the know-how, built up its industries and are opening up to free market competition now slowly. Had they not done that and went to straight competition with US products and others, would have been overrun and probably never be able to catch up to the West.

Hungary never had its chance for such idle time. From planned, inefficient, socialist economy,  went straight to competition.

1349,"&gt; While Thatcher is responsible for much of the Conservative eurosceptism, the ERM crisis and Maastricht changed the nature of it.

I'm not sure it changed the nature of it, so much as it blew the vail from the Thatcherite approach. Selling the EU as primarily a common market (which is where some but far from all of the left wing opposition came from) became much harder in the run up to Maastricht after all.

&gt;It became more overt and it has cemented the idea that Britain was special in comparison to the rest of the EU.

I think the argument there is that the UK always saw the EU as fulfilling a different role to other EU countries. That comes partially out of WWII and partially out of the UK's broadly global outlook in the 60's and 70's.. The UK approach to the EU has always been an extension of that and it's still very much visible in the discussions today..

&gt;It is also when the more vocal critics came out, with parties like UKIP and the short lived Referendum Party being created.

UKIP didn't really gather significant steam until 2005 though, and it wasn't until it managed to merge left and right wing opposition (when it started taking both Tory and Labour votes..) that it seemed to have any major success.  Yes you can trace that back to Maastricht (as a catalyst for the formation..) but you can also pull it beyond that if you want too.

&gt;The UK would gain more in power and influence by being part of it and that would make up for it. 

I seriously doubt that. The Euro isn't really structured that way, and the UK's views on what the EU should be are still somewhat different from other EU members. The argument would have been that the single currency facilitates more friction-less trade, it wouldn't have opened the door to more integration generally.  It would however have put the UK inside the Eurozone and so more integrated than it is.

&gt;The countries in the world that have the most influence....

Except.. They aren't. Lots of very large countries have almost no influence, many smaller countries have more influence than their size would suggest. Plus, the EU isn't a country, the UK within the EU might see some benefit in terms of influence where the UK and EU interests are aligned, but broadly it'd mean that the UK had less independent say globally, and be only one voice in a large union.  I don't think its a particularly good argument for the EU in the context of the UK (given that the UK is not a 'small' country in terms of economic output, military power or influence generally.

Membership of the Euro however would leave the UK with less control over some of the major levers that governments have in terms of domestic policy, and that's rather a big thing to give away without a significant upside.

&gt;If you are talking about schengen that is even more ridiculous.

I'm talking about Schengen, the UK opt outs on 'freedom, security and justiceI'/home affairs, as well as the Eurozone.

It needlessly costs billions in lost tourism and investment as well as adding more in pointless infrastructure. 

The UK is an Island, so in terms of infrastructure it has almost no impact, when it comes to tourism it might have a marginal impact given the UK and Ireland manage their own visas, but I doubt it's massive, and I can't see it having much of an impact at all on investment.

&gt; and And before you cite the jungle....

I wouldn't cite the jungle, it'd be an issue with or without the UK being in Schengen as the UK would still have had to have border checks at ports to some extent, and the UK would likely still have refused entry and ended up with the security that is in place at the moment. Schengen doesn't get rid of border checks at ports and airports after all, it simply makes it easier for EU nationals passing through them.

&gt; It is absurd that this was seldomly ever debated and just arrogantly assumed that the UK’s geography proves that they can do it better.

It's not that the UK can do better, but rather that the UK doesn't have land borders with EU countries where driving and not stopping makes a significant difference. If you need to check tickets, checking passports is hardly a major additional issue.

&gt;The uk would gain even more due to regular trains and ferry services. 

The UK has regular train and ferry services....

&gt;Probably why most Brits didn’t appreciate it because it didn’t make traveling to the rest of the EU significantly different. It is also why Ireland was barred from joining as it would make the CTA invalid.

The CTA dealt with the same issue, but between Ireland and the UK, and obviously pre-dates the EU. Essentially for the UK and Ireland, the CTA provides all the benefits of Schengen while still allowing both to maintain a little more control over entry ports and airports.. It's not as though the UK being out of Schengen (in terms of the borders aspect) made much difference. Being outside of it in terms of visa issuance probably did, but I doubt it was much of one.

&gt;I don’t think that is a good thing, since it seems to be treated more as a referendum on the political climate at that time more than it was about the EU. It was also a terribly ran campaign on both sides of the debate.

I think you miss the point if you think it was a protest  vote, largely down to the campaigns. There has been a lot of broad, if fairly shallow Euro-scepticism since it joined the EU.  The problem largely was that there was no way to express that in the normal political discourse (bar voting for lunatics like UKIP..) so people didn't. Providing a referendum essentially created a one off to actually vote on the issue. That is a good thing, and the debate lasted far longer than the (rather terrible..) campaigns did.

&gt;I really don’t think it would and there is little reason to think it would. This argument seems to be following the logic of that the 2008 crisis hit EZ members worse and that in turn hit the banking system worse. 

No.. The argument is that many of the tools that the UK used wouldn't have been available if it had been part of the single currency, as it wouldn't have been in a position to set interest rates or modify its money supply... It's the need for the EZ to apply policy that works for all its members that is relevant, and if the UK had been in the EU, that policy would have been even more mismatched across the block.

&gt;The UK has a large banking industry therefore it would be worse off. But when you look on a elemental level this doesn’t really seem to the case. While yes banking was hit worse, it also was the industry with one of the quickest recovery rates. 

Because the UK was able to act in a way that EU members couldn't. That's the point..

&gt;We have seen how quickly the service sector recovered in Ireland for example, of course I am aware of the tax insensitives but that doesn’t disprove the argument. 

It ignores the massive differences in scale between the UK and Ireland, and the different approaches immediately after the crash though!

&gt;The UK has actually been following the eurozone pretty closely on many metrics, which is pretty good evidence to hint at the UK not doing too badly within it. ...

The UK started a massive QE programme, dropped interest rates faster and further than the ECB (from a higher level) and so on. That's really quite important.

&gt;The interest rate is also rather inpecise and has to be set in rather tight limits as such it has closely followed such trends of the eurozone members, making it not much use.

It's quite an important tool for the BoE in terms of managing economic demand and output though... I mean, you can't just write off the value of being able to set your own interest rates..

&gt;Except leaving the eurozone is another thing to leaving the EU. While I don’t think it is irreversible, it is still pretty hard, there is no Article 50 process for a start....

Leaving the EU and remaining in the Eurozone is clearly not possible though, so as the UK left the EU it would have had to leave the Euro, creating a major problem for the EZ. 

&gt;Not necessarily, EU was largely used as scapegoat for a multitude of issues and this will be no doubt after Brexit happens and people are still unhappy. Probably even more so as they feel betrayed by it.

The EU was used as a scapegoat, but it is not without its problems either. And you are right that not every problem the UK has will be solved by leaving the EU, but it will put the UK on a different path. I think you overestimate the amount of people voting to leave on the basis of a false idea of what the EU is and does, or that there isn't a significant group of people within the UK that simply do not believe that the EU, and its current direction are a good fit for the UK..

&gt;I really don’t think so for the reason highlighted above. You also seem to be projecting current events on top of it and what is clear is that even minor things can have a huge knock on effect.

Obviously we can never predict the future, but I think that broadly the EU as a political project simply doesn't work for most people in the UK. It's why the arguments from the remain side have been so focused on economics, not everything else, and its why we had a leave vote. If the EU were just an economic block it'd be very different, but it isn't, and that was always (whether the UK was in the EZ or not) going to come to a head.  I spend a fair amount of time in Germany and France (and speak German well, and French poorly..) speak to a lot of colleagues in Germany and France and frankly there is a fundamentally different view of what the EU is in those countries when compared to the UK.  That isn't something that can be wished away, and I don't think it is something artificial created by the UK media, or some legacy of empire, or false sense of exceptionalism.

I think that both the UK and EU will benefit far more from being close partners, rather than the UK being a member, but I suppose time will tell.

1438,"&gt;Much of the anti EU sentiment got momentum during Maastricht, which of course was the treaty that created the euro and grew following that.

Maastricht + ERM + Black Wednesday and the 1992 recession are sort of all linked together. But the issues that led to opposition to Maastricht predate the Euro and the ERM by quite a bit, there was a good decade of euroscepticism both on the left and right before that, with Thatcher having to face down a fair amount of that, which arguably led to the common market and arguably the UK rebate. The early 90's were  certainly the period in which we saw a lot of issues that brought it massively to a head though. Although as an issue It did drop off in relevance afterwards too.  

I would argue that the early 90s were a turning point, we went from Labour and the left being the most vocal critics of the EU to the birth of what would become UKIP. Not to say that there wasn't opposition on both sides of the political divide (there was an is) but rather that disillusionment with the EU project became much broader, and included attacks on the economic and trade structures from both ends..

I'd absolutely agree that being out of the Euro meant that the UK relegated itself even more (I'd argue rightly..) to the fringe of the project, and that being outside of the Eurozone (as well as the various other elements that the UK never signed up to) made both the decision to hold a referendum, the outcome and now leaving the EU far more possible though, although to a certain extent I'd still see it as almost an inevitability. 

&gt;It is one of the reasons why I think the UK was wrong to have not join the euro and people who oppose it should be gloating about it like it dodged a bullet.

To be honest I'd argue that its a dodged bullet for both the UK and the EU. While it might have been argued that being in the Euro would make it far harder to leave the EU, I don't think it'd have been a clinching argument. Not least because inside the Euro the UK would likely have felt a much larger impact from the 2008 crash and fewer tools to manage the aftermath, I think the EU would have taken a lot of the blame for that. Throw in that all the fundamental issues that people have with the EU would still have been there, and we'd be in a position where the UK would now be leaving the EU and the Eurozone, and so likely creating a much larger threat to the EU as a project than it is as a non-Eurozone country.",,/r/europe/comments/94tgku/the_british_euro_what_a_uk_euro_coin_would_have/e3oe1zi/,ajehals,1533518592

1490,"Well take into account there is lots of people working under submerged economy conditions (they are declared unemployed although they are actually working). This affects both the numbers of unemployment and the state revenue (as well as their future because since they appear as unemployed they lose their right to unemployment subsidies as well as pensions since having worked and paid taxes is a prerequisite to have both emergency/final subsidies).

I’m not saying we don’t have a kind of structural problem with both unemployment, education and healthcare; but if we don’t have a better system is because we refuse to protest toward change (and I don’t mean podemos or independence, they both play with sensitive issues and search for the best possible political outcome for them; while keeping that system they are “fighting” in the same position - enchufismo, corruption and so on). 

Better investment, tax revenue and general wealth improve by diminishing general taxes and improving overall state efficiency (which requires political and popular will). If one of the two are absent this is not possible - also public servants must improve their efficiency which is a quasi impossible task in any mother state. 

Today’s problems are not easy and disconnected problems; but rather require strongly interlinked solutions to solve a problem that may come form multiple roots (like unemployment) - also erasing the bad social image associated to vocational training (formación profesional) has on our society.

In Britain we have this long history of individual liberty. Instead of the state demanding we identify ourselves. We demand that the so-called agents of the state identify themselves to us. We are individuals who are going about our lives in work, pleasure or whatever. We aren't content to be stopped and told to produce documentation for existing.

It only addresses one of them (Orbán hacking unanimous decisions in the Council) and even that one in a less than optimal way. The decision making process in the EU needs serious reforms. I do like some of his reform ideas, though.

In a speech at Sorbonne University last year, he spoke about it in more detail. He wants fewer Commissioners, 15 at most, which is a good thing. Now there are 28 of them and they need to think up issues to make sure each of them has one. He wants to reform the CAP, but I'm skeptical of that coming from a French politician.

Such as what specificly and what are your sources other than your imagination?

As for Bush, it is a simple question.  If you hate Trump for doubting the intelligence community do you support Bush not doubting the same intelligence community.  Are you claiming that the intelligence community can do no wrong and all presidents should believe them?  or do you reserve the right to pick and choose when they should be believed and do you extend that right to their boss?  

That is the response to your first sentence.  I do not see any reason to bother reading anymore of it if that is an example of it.

Like a lot of people in this thread explain Ireland was technically neutral but silently aiding the Allies. If the Germans find out English ships regularly sail under the Irish flag, it would paint a major target on *all* Irish ships. You want to turn a semi-ally into an enemy? Because that's how you turn a semi-ally into an enemy.

On top of that, if they could be a slippery slope in that if you do it, the enemy might think ""well, might as well play dirty too"". A bit like how both sides withheld from using chemical weapons, because everyone knows that once that first shell hits the game changes. Picture that: even Adolf ""possibly worst human being of all time"" Hitler didn't want to use chemical weapons (well, not for the conventional war anyway). 

Sailing under wrong colors still happened, but IIRC it was mainly limited to commando raids and such. And not without risk, because chances are that instead of being taken to a POW camp to sit around until the war ends you might get shot (IIRC Hitler at one point orders that all captured commandos are to be executed). 

Small addition: There is footage of a U-boat crewmember throwing loafs of bread at lifeboats of a ship they just sank, because they might starve without it. 'Ship has sunk, job done, those sailors are no threat, we can't take them aboard, but at the least we can give them some food'. I don't know if this happened often (might be a fun question for /r/askhistorians) but again with the ""slippery slope"": If you play dirty and treat enemies like shit, they might do the same.

Coal was one of those unprofitable industries* (although it had been on life support for decades, due to mine depletion), although it spiraled into a wider conflict about union power and London/SE vs the rest of the UK. It also invokes a lot of anger because mines tended to build mining towns, and the mines were closed rapidly with no plans to retrain the workers, or anything similar. As a result a lot of those towns collapsed or dropped into poverty, destroying communities.

Another worrying thing to consider is, that this alone won't do anything without keeping the momentum of activism alive, and sometime aiming at the pillars of the dictator's power to shake up his foundation. If that's wisdom and knowledge that a theoretical Hungarian activist group would also have, that we have yet to see.

1645,"&gt; In 2008 Milosevic has been out of power for 8 years. NATO intervention back in 1999 specifally stated it does not seek Kosovo independence (specifically it quoted Rambouillet Agreement that proposed far-reaching autonomy for Kosovo, but not independence).

You can't expect the people of a region who just 10 years prior were being hunted down like animals to peacefully go to those who were killing them. The moment Milosevic took away the autonomy of Kosovo is where he signed his own end

&gt;Then give the people opportunity to present that case, call in referendum on status of northern Kosovo under auspice of EU and UN. But we both know what the result would be if that decision would be left to residents. Only question is if ""reintegration with Serbia"" would win with majority or with absolute majority.

It would not happen not only because of what I previously stated but also because they would not allow either N.K. or R.S. to secede, just like they did not allow Kosovo to secede to Albania. If it truly was left up to the people then the whole idea of ""illegal Kosovo"" gets thrown down the window since its what the people want, not to mention the fact that theres an enclave of Albanians in South Serbia in greater numbers then there are Serbians in N.K, I highly doubt Serbia would sacrifice an entire region for a small poor part that will be empty due to centralisation if it joins Serbia. It would be a win win situation for Haradinaj and Albanians if that were to happen and we would hear even more fear mongering about ""Greater Albania""

The internationals and Haradinaj are probably playing on the fact that come 5-10 years said region will have a drastically different demographic due to natality rates and mass migration, which is why Serbian officials have been so adamant in the last months for a border change. Look at the timelapse, they went from never, to maybe, to lets swap borders. 
   What they are really after is not the benefit of their people but the Trepca mines and the more time passes the less chances they have of getting them.

1678,"That's right. And Thatcher inherited an industrial sector which was in deep decline as well. Our firms were uncompetitive on the world market and some major businesses like Rolls Royce had to be nationalised at taxpayer expense for years before it was ready to return to the competitive market place. 

The biggest disaster of them all was British Leyland, an amalgamation of all the major british car brands into a single firm. The upper management didn't have the vision to steer it onto a prosperous footing. The unions were also very strong in the 1970s, so industrial disruption was common place. The result was a poor product which gained a reputation for shoddy build quality. In the end, private foreign car firms scavanged the corpse and came away with brands like Jaguar and Mini. Old industrial British cars like Austin and Rover just lingered on before dying. 

So in conclusion, to blame the industrial fall on Thatcher misses the bigger picture. Whilst she did reduce government subsidy for industry all it did was quicken up the demise of industry which was far behind its international peers on price and quality.

I did some research and apparently there is some kind of structural difference between an ancient 'Theatre' and an 'Amphitheatre' and there were less of the latter in [Asia Minor](http://turkisharchaeonews.net/article/ancient-amphitheatres-and-theatres-asia-minor) and Greece for some reason. I also presume that there would be less space for new massive buildings in densely urban and ancient regions like Asia Minor, Greece, Egypt and so forth who already had tons of well established cities that the Romans could just chill in without bothering to undertake construction projects.

But looking around for a while, there is an actual [Amphitheatre in Alexandria, Egypt](https://www.memphistours.com/Egypt/WikiTravel/Attractions-Alexandria/wiki/Roman-Amphitheatre-Alexandria) at least, but it was constructed in the 2nd century AD, so that makes sense.",,/r/europe/comments/94tczk/amphitheatres_in_roman_empire/e3nreor/,Questiori,1533495533

I hitchhiked that summer with my wife-to-be, it just happened to be 1982 and the UK was at war. And the Pope visited Glasgow. And the world cup was in Spain that summer, which I was unaware of (as an American) until I got there. On a side note, I got the worst sunburn I ever had on a beach south of Arundel. 
 
So, I'm not going to lie and say it didn't happen. It did. Get over it.

Against who exactly? The 1932-33 famine wasn't a ""genocide"", there's no evidence it was targeted at Ukrainians and Stalin cannot control the frigging weather. Again, until the west, who have every incentive to accuse the USSR of genocide say they did it, accusations of genocide are silly. I've had enough of you defending Nazis and Capitalist murderers, Capitalism has killed well over a Billion people if you want to play the death toll game, and your precious Winston Churchill deliberately killed 5 million Indians, the British capitalist class killed 25% of Irelands population for profit and the genocide and massacres continue. You are a capitalist apologist. Even now the West cannot help its racist imperialism, even turning it on Eastern Europe, who's people it uses as a source of cheap labour, makes them work in shitty conditions for shitty pay, forcing them to live in flats with 13 people crammed into 3 rooms, and then having the audacity to attack them in the street, call them inferior slavs, say the Romainans are thieving gypsy, and say they don't want the Poles or Romanians or whoever to live near them because they are violent thieves. Even against other Europeans they can't help racist imperialism.

1782,"Bahçeli has been Erdoğan's puppet from day one. MHP supported AKP frequently in the parliament and in public. Some politicians from MHP may have barked a bit after getting drunk on their victory and votes stolen from AKP but Bahçeli is nowhere near that ambitious to pull a Machiavellian move like giving the appearance of a lapdog only to backstab his enemy while he wasn't looking. The deal is plain. AKP suppresses dissidents in MHP and makes sure Bahçeli sits on his MHP seat until the end of time, in return Bahçeli becomes Erdoğan's bitch. And being Erdoğan's bitch has the unintended effect of attracting AKP voters. Even if Bahçeli was offered presidency on a silver plate I don't think he'd accept it. He seems like content enough to be the living away the rest of his days on the MHP throne.

&gt; Bahçeli isn't exactly Erdogan's lapdog, it wouldn't make sense either otherwise he'd lose all his voters to AKP who would think what's the point of voting MHP anyway?

This is the exact reason why a portion of AKP voters switched to MHP in the last election. They were ideologically aligned with AKP, they didn't want to betray their leader, but they were a bit unhappy about something Erdoğan has done. They wanted to do a protest vote. Rather than completely betray everything they stand for by voting for CHP, the arch-enemy of their way of living in their minds, they vote for AKP-lite, which is MHP.

Currently MHP voters are best described as ""AKP voters who don't like AKP as much""

You could say CHP needs to be AKP-lite like MHP, suck up to Erdoğan really hard, do everything he says and then backstab him after stealing votes now that would be another discussion entirely.

&gt; Not enough to vote CHP clearly. In Europe, that would have been enough to have them switch party completely even party loyalists. Clearly the level of hatred in Turkey is nowhere near that of Europe.

You underestimate the loyalty and devotion Turks have for Erdoğan. It is like the devotion one has for their prophet. A simple hatred of refugees won't be enough to subvert that. Maybe if they starve to death their death rattle might be something like ""maybe I was slightly wrong"" but that's that. Have you seen the ""if Erdoğan fucked my mother, my mother would be the whore"" video? You should if you haven't.

I doubt most of Europe are partisans like in Turkey so events like refugees can shift their opinions.",big bad turk under your bed,/r/europe/comments/94q7io/turkish_core_inflation_reaches_14_year_high/e3nsfqg/,Elatra,1533496549

Lenin was a revolutionary. Not a ruler. 

Again you can not judge Lenin on the actions of others. You are not going to convince anyone that what lenin stood for, was inferior, to what was governing the country before him...

A sickly monarch in Tsar Nicholas, and a deranged sociopathic priest, with complete control.. Called Rasputin.

The principles of Marx still stand in todays flawed capitalistic system. Indeed many of the principles that drive some of the top economic producers in the Nordic countries, are socialist. Principles inspired by Marx and what Lenin, as fore-runner and tried to achieve for Russia, with imperfect knowledge at the time. Aka.. It was a first.#

What The soviet union evolved to, was not freedom of the proletariat in the end. But that does not villify lenin. You equating it to Lenin, is like me equating Hitler to right wing politics. Its more complicated than that, and not even true. A lot of Hitlers actions were indeed socialist to a degree despite his hate of communists. 

You are dumbing down history so much... and putting everything into a single bracket... Aka - Soviet Russia was overall bad.. So we learnt nothing?

So how would Marxism look like in the current economic landscape? Well it would never stand alone. Every single political system is an emulgation of various concepts.

One possible idea of the future, is a cohesive union of Marxism, Liberatarianism, Democracy, and Keynsian principles. Imagine a star trek like future, where money is not controlled by the state, or conglomerates. But rather workers. Your output gives you value. You are paid in Capital, rather than wages.. Your capital moves with you as you change jobs. This making Wage labour obsolete.

In any case I have rambled on. But Lenin, represented a change, from something worse, into something better. The troubles of the Soviet Union, and its eventual collapse, is not a story of this 'bright' past that was extinguished. It is a storied history of gradual progression. Ofocurse, with the giant hiccup of Stalin and World war 2 followed by a brutal cold war. 

The biggest winner of the cold war.. Despite what many believe.. Is obviously America.. But the other big winner is actually Germany. The fact that Russia and USA were competing through west and east berlin, brought unprecedented growth, to a country that was meant to be left in the ashes, after what they did in WW2. The Americans bolstered west germany so hard, to win their ideological war. The Russian's did the same on the East. Ofcourse, the Americans did a much better job, hence the giant difference between the two sides.

Meanwhile countries like Greece never even got war reparations.. The Americans solution for Greece.. Was a Junta dictatorship Government, to sort it out, and prevent and Soviet influence. Indeed American interference and influence, plunged Greece into one of its darkest period, second only to the ottoman occupation.",,/r/europe/comments/94iqb6/the_swedish_band_rebecca_fiona_performing_during/e3nkf4w/,Shadow3ragon,1533488572

Were NATO to intervene, it'd become another footnote in ""proxy wars"" wikipedia article - even if they lose it eventually, it'd only fuel ""whole world is out to get us"" nationalist sentiment.

&gt; That's not to say I disagree with your conclusion. Sending troops would probably be a step too far at this point. But we should not be afraid to take sides in the conflict. Again, that does not rule out claiming neutrality and ""mediating"" between the sides.

Some deserted the Defense Forces to fight the Germans, and when they returned they were [shunned](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-16287211). In the North, where Catholics/Nationalists were living under the heels of the Protestants/Unionists, even they answered the call; and their families were shunned by their own community for it.

2039,"I'm a Serb, from Serbia, so I've been reading about Operation Storm for a few days in Serbian media, for almost 20 years, every single year since I've started reading. And every single year it's the same. Serbs are pushing agenda that they where forced to leave, Croats are pushing agenda that they liberated their territory from Serbian Occupation. Every single f*****g year. 

And every side has its points (Serbs where living there for centuries, even got some sort of autonomy in the Austro-Hungarian Empire as military territory guarding the Realm from Otomas), Serbs where rightfully scared of the Croatians, due to the things that happened 50 years before (see Independent State of Croatia, and the crimes against Serbs, Jews, Romas, and even Croats that was not on Nazi side in the war). Serbs where afraid that, with Ustashe coming back (lets be real there where people wearing Ustashe signs in the war), the killing of Serbs will be done again. Because of these facts they decided to leave their homes before the attacks started. 250 000 people left their homes, where their grandparents where born (that has great significance in the Balkans)

I also see the Croatian side of things, bombing Vukovar, Zagreb, and Dubrovnik, Croats where forced to leave territories with Serb majority, Chetniks coming back, obvious military support from Serbia as a country (at start it was not an even battle). Because of this, I understand it is an important day for you.

My roots are from Banija and Lika, territories that is now in Croatia. Luckily my family moved from there in the 1960's so i haven't directly experienced the horrors of war (I was little) but I remember relatives that was coming and staying at our house for years because they had to leave everything there, houses, clothes, life stock. They literally came to my house with nothing only than one suitcase of necessities in the back of the tractor trailer. Everything that they where working for their entire life, gone. I understand that is war, that same thing happened to Croats as well.

Only thing i don't seem to understand, why do you celebrate like this, something that has every element of ethnic cleansing. In Serbia, we don't celebrate Vukovar, Zagreb, or Srebrenica, nor even ethnic cleansing at Kosovo in '98-'99. You have more important dates, and bigger events in your history to celebrate. You where a great kingdom 10 centuries ago, with great history figures. I get you gain control of your entire land, but at what cost? 

I guess what I'm trying to say, fuck the war. Many people suffered, only few benefited (politicians), and they benefit from this every single year on both sides.

2194,"&gt;Do you think people in rural areas eat the food that is produced locally? It has to travel just as much, if not more due to people being more spread out and far from distribution centers that are close to cities and ports.

But in rural areas, people could at least in theory eat food that is locally produced, unlike in cities.

&gt;Secondly, food traveling isn’t a huge emitter of pollution. They are moved in trucks by the ton. Unlike people who move as 1,5 people per 4 tons pick-up truck in rural areas. Especially if they are going to work in the cities.

It's not only about food, it's about every single commodity and service that you need or want. In a city, all of those must be brought to you from somewhere else. In the countryside, it's not necessary in the same manner and they could be produced more locally.

&gt;People in cities use public transport and bikes, live in small apartments and, even for water, it is easier to get drinkable water to 1 million people living in a Barcelona neighborhood through pipes than to 100 000 people who live spread out over the area of Spain.

In a city, you can't just dig a well into your yard. 

&gt;It’s not even a debate, data shows that city dwellers produce 3x less CO2 than rural people. Ideally, 99% of people should live in cities.


Data also shows that cities contribute 75% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions even if they  cover just 2% of the earth’s surface. It's irrelevant whether a single individual in a city contributes a bit less when there's 100 times more of them in the same area. Like I said, cities have no natural boundaries to growth, and they will continue growing as long as they can suck enough resources from somewhere else. In a city, an individual can't utilize his own work for his own survival and thus must rely to the huge city infrastructure to take care of his needs. 

&gt;As the Netherlands have shown, you only need 2 or 3 people per hundred hectares to produce food. That number might go lower in the future and we could have 10-15 mega corps with a limited number of employees producing all the food we need. As long as you don’t give any subsidies and tax pesticide and resource use, corporations are better able to use precision farming and high tech to limit their impact on the environment than paying out 100k a year to some farmer who owns 2 hectares and can’t even afford a nitrogen monitoring drone.

Okay, so what will everyone else do then? Watch Netflix in a tiny apartment and work by pressing a button in an office? Complete misallocation of working potential and resources. They could be all growing food for themselves and the people around them with their own physical labor, yet they sit idle doing absolutely nothing while the system takes care of them. That is not sustainable. 

&gt;There can be a limit to the growth of cities. Ideally all rural land around cities should be replaced by woods so that cities don’t grow further and densify instead. The more people by square km, the better. Of course farmers unions are against that too, as for some reason having rural land in the middle of Paris or London is a good thing?

Okay, so people must be separated from their natural environment to dystopian cities just so they can't utilize their own working potential to anything and waste it all while machines bring them bananas to the closest supermarket? There is not much good about cities. They exist for themselves, not for humans. In cities, humans are like big cogs in a machine that aims to function as efficiently as possible to pursue irrelevant goals. Most jobs in cities are completely irrelevant. Urbanization is a symptom of a disease we call infinite economic growth. Cities serve it the most efficiently and that's why they grow regardless of how unsustainable or pointless all the work being done is. All the basic human needs would be more than well fulfilled with one's own labor in his natural environment, yet somehow this system has pushed them to be inactive and passive beings doing completely different things that they would need for their survival and well-being. 

&gt;Rural living and traditional farming needs to die for the sake of all of us.

For the sake of the people who most benefit from people pressing a button in an office in the middle of a city instead of working towards their own and their community's well-being. While cities are unsustainable, they are also restrictive and completely superficial. They monitor and restrict the people, they manipulate people, they separate them from the natural world, they take away their independence as free individuals.

Even in Mediterranean countries with milder climate you won't see AC units everywhere because the really hot days (35°C+) are generally not continuous, and the investment is generally not worth for it to be used ~30 days a year.

2262,"&gt; The EU has clear conditions (if free trade of goods, then free exchange of persons), which Britain is not willing to meet.

I agree that there are conflicting red lines for much of what might be done, with two major exceptions:

* First, an FTA violates no red lines on either side.

* Second, I suspect you are incorrect about the EU binding free trade in goods to free movement of people.  A ""goods but no people"" setup is actually what the EU does with Turkey.

    I'd consider that arrangement very disadvantageous to Turkey, as Turkey cannot set her tariff schedule, has no input in the EU tariff schedule, has no input in FTAs negotiated by the EU, must abide by them, and gains no reciprocal access in EU FTAs.  I would not want to accept the same deal, were I the UK.  But, that does meet your requirements.  It violates nobody's red lines, and I'm sure that the EU would accept a comparable arrangement tomorow, given the option.

2313,"&gt;It is against vital interests of Germany's allies. 

Allies meaning Poland and Baltic states, who want to have leverage over Germany, by having some degree of control over transit into EU countries, and benefit from transit money. They also would be glad to make Germany hostage of the situation in Ukraine. Should Ukraine begin stealing gas, leading to shut down of energy supply into Europe, like it used to be, Germany's economy and people would be affected.

Germany does not want any of that stuff, because why would they?

&gt;TLDR it is selfish. How hard is it to comprehend? 

It is selfish for Germany. But it is also not selfish, because other countries in the center of Europe, will be in a safer position, because they will not depend on just one potentially unstable route. It's not just Germany, who is doing it on EU side.

Folks in, say, Austria, don't want to freeze in the winter, should some radical ""patriotic"" Ukrainian groups blow up a pipeline on their territory (like they tried to blow up infrastructure around Crimea) or whatnot.

Also demanding from Germany that it is supposed to be leveraged by Poland and Baltic states is selfish for them. 

So there is that. Clash of different interests. But some are in a stronger position than others.

2346,"That would be a gross misrepresentation and simplification of the process of American centralization and how it relates to European fears of ""federalization"". Despite being named differently there is a strong parallel in regard to that.

America ""federalized"" without any prior example of what that meant, same as Switzerland. But when Europeans say ""federalism"" they mean American-style centralism, especially since Swiss-style federalism is a giant blindspot in the eyes of the eurosceptic who will praise that country for everything, except its multiculturalism and political system.

Take for example the central bank issue. Americans inherently misstrusted the concept of a central bank managing monetary policy. Both the First and Second National banks died out of a political and ideological push to limit the powers of the federal government (see the ""Bank War"") in favour of private business, despite the severe instability in the economy and monetary supply.  The last attempt at central banking, the federal reserve, became an absolute necessity by the time of the Great Depression, but the ideological anti-centrist push back was strong forcing private institutions to have a significant say in it's running and emposing an unworkable decetralization on it. Now America has the worst of all worlds with a extremely centralized Federal Reserve hosted in the New York branch with significant private interest involvement. This is in comparison to the , IMO, better designed if restricted ECB with state representation rather than the unworkable decentralized system.

You can run similar parallels of anti-centralist rebellion across the development of the United States with the institutions where they were the most involved in turning out the most neurotic and nearly unworkable as they engaged in ideologically driven sabotage until reality itself forced them to back down, and only for a little while. This is something that is repeating in Europe with the ""eurosceptics"" which include Merkel and Rutte like politicians, resisting any attempt at reform causing crisis after crisis and forcing eventual drastic over-centralist measures to fix them or risk collapse.

2466,"The British did not immediately kick off carpet-bombing cities, but acted in what they considered a response to bombing of British cities.

I'm not sure how much difference there was in American and British approach.  If there was, I'd point out that we hadn't had our cities bombed by Germany.  We had Japan throw a few shells from subs and cause very minor damage to a refinery and an army base on a total of two occasions, but Germany had no meaningful way to cause damage to US cities.

It's rather easy not to want to retaliate when nobody has done anything comparable to you.

The British, on the other hand, had just lived through the London Blitz:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz

&gt;The Germans conducted mass air attacks against industrial targets, towns and cities, beginning with raids on London towards the end of the Battle of Britain in 1940, a battle for daylight air superiority between the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force over the United Kingdom. By September 1940, the Luftwaffe had failed and the German air fleets (Luftflotten) were ordered to attack London, to draw RAF Fighter Command into a battle of annihilation.[5][6] Adolf Hitler and Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered the new policy on 6 September 1940. From 7 September 1940, London was systematically bombed by the Luftwaffe for 56 out of the following 57 days and nights.[7] Most notable was a large daylight attack against London on 15 September.
&gt;
&gt;The Luftwaffe gradually decreased daylight operations in favour of night attacks to evade attack by the RAF, and the Blitz became a night bombing campaign after October 1940. The Luftwaffe attacked the main Atlantic sea port of Liverpool in the Liverpool Blitz and the North Sea port of Hull, a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets, suffered the Hull Blitz. Bristol, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Southampton and Swansea were also bombed, as were the industrial cities of Birmingham, Belfast, Coventry, Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield. More than 40,000 civilians were killed by Luftwaffe bombing during the war, almost half of them in the capital, where more than a million houses were destroyed or damaged.[1]

And then you had the V-1 and V-2 weapons, with accuracy limited enough that they could only target cities.

And Churchill certainly presented bombing Germany in a comparable — but greater — way as a justifiable response.  While he was an advocate of strategic bombing, he did not actually engage in it until it had been done to his country.

https://winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-137/churchill-proceedings-churchill-and-bombing-policy/

&gt;On 24 August 1940 the first German bombs fell in central London; several had already fallen in suburban areas. On the following night, 25/26 August, more than eighty British bombers struck, for the first time, at Berlin. There were few casualties on either side, but a deadly confrontation had begun.
&gt;
&gt;The next German air raid on London was by day on 26 August. Learning of a British bombing raid on Leipzig that same day, Churchill wrote to Sinclair: “Now that they have begun to molest the capital, I want you to hit them hard, and Berlin is the place to hit them.” While London was being pounded almost every night by German bombers, these smaller raids against Berlin helped raise British morale.
&gt;
&gt;President Roosevelt also contributed to the bombing debate. On 27 September 1940, his advice was passed on to Churchill by Sir Walter Layton, head of one of the British missions in Washington. The President, wrote Layton, “had always urged that we should bomb Germany everywhere, not merely at a few points.”",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/94b86p/uproar_after_italian_minister_wants_to_end/e3mtu6a/,vokegaf,1533447821

2487,"&gt;Europe isnt a monolith

Neither are countries, there are regional differences between cities within a country just like there are differences between Countries within Europe.  But these cities, although differences between them, all together have more differences between cities in a different region, this plane is called a ""country"". What people like you and  KuyaJohnny dont understand is that this works like [cladistics trees](http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/2011/andryscz_tyle/gallery.htm), and when going up these ""culture"" levels you will eventually reach a ""European"" level before you cross over to Africa. So yes we are alike because we are all Europeans.

What you say isnt  even well defined, let me try to analyze it more discretely, lets separate culture into cuisine, music, custom, costume, and architecture.  An consider Russia and Netherlands.

Cuisine: Because of globalism, in most larger cities of any country in Europe you can find similar food,

Music: Seriosly? Russia many world class classical composers like,  Stravinsy, Thaikovski, ...

Custom: Despite the rebranding the Netherlands has done since the last half century it has historically been a christian country. Even Orthodoxy is more similar to Protestantism than Islam, Buddhism, or Shamanism.  What about language, both are Indo European languages. Also Russia built itself a navy modeled after the Dutch. Even the flags are imitated.

Costume: Do you think a Rus warrior wearing chain mail, one handed sword, and nasal helmet was more different to a  Danish one from the early medieval period than for instance and Arabic one? What about the Russian empire? Peter the great made everyone wear Dutch stile clothing.

Architecture:  Ever heard of the renaissance? baroque style? Just look at Russian imperial buildings, Or saint Peters berg. All trough out Europe you can find similar architecture, despite each cities differences you can find underlying similarities that clearly distinct them from those outside of Europe. That is European culture for you.

I disagree.

Christian notions of compassion and forgiveness come from the idea that one of the qualities of the Godhead is reward of Earthly conduct in Heaven, and that God desires his creations to be kind to one another in fulfillment of His own love for them.

Ahimsa as a doctrine grows out of Brahmanic development of the Yajur Veda and Upanishad bhashya commentaries where (Buddhist trigger warning) *Advaitin* ideas of atman as Ishvara jave their logical conclusion in imputing a duty to act in non-violence.

They're wholly distinct ideas, with completely different justifications rooted in deeply ancient and themselves different people (Bronze Age Rg Vedic Indo-Aryans and Semitic/Levantines are not the same, and likely never had many descendants meet until after the West's Industrial Revolution ---- like when I went to Catholic school in America)

Why not? American identity isn't based on ethnicity or ancestry, it's about how you choose to identify. Also there were in fact Asian Americans and even South Asian Americans who fought in the Civil War, so don't try to pull that shit on me, pal

There is fundamentally an American ethnicity that people know exists when they hear my accent or discover my politics and think ""well he's as American as anyone else""

Except there literally isn't an ""American ethnicity"". All the commonalities and connections that define being American are cultural and not ethnic. Ethnic ties involve familial and blood ties, which aren't at all needed to be American.

""Those divisions are recent, but real ---- but we can't admit that just maybe Danes are a nation? And that MENA/Central Asian peoples who arrive there simply are not Danish in less than one generation?""

Really? Because I moved to the States from India when I was five and I'm a fully integrated American. My older brother was 18 when he moved here and he's a fully integrated American. The same could work for immigrants to Denmark. It's 100% doable, if you give the immigrant community the chance to integrate and participate in larger society.

Except it is horribly racist because there's this gross implication that Americans are less committed or loyal to America (or whichever country they move to) simply because they were born elsewhere. Not to mention it feeds into an us-vs-them attitude towards immigrants.

""Think of it this way - Rudyard Kipling, and other Anglo-Indians; were they Indian?Just as Marathi as Shivaji for being born and raised in Bombay?""

Anglo-Indians didn't identify with India, they identified with Britain. And it's not like modern Indo-Americans in that there is a degree of identity with both. Anglo-Indians identified as full-on Brits born elsewhere in the Empire rather than people of that colony.

""Obviously many Anglo-Indians were never really English, and many forever lived happily in the land of their birth, deeply enmeshed in a hybridized culture (which still exists to some degree, including in India) that has its ""reverse"" and other permutations on descent and birthplace and borrowings, but never were they truly Indian and no one would insist that they were either.""

It's not like they the Anglo-Indians participated in that hybridized culture out of preference for it. The culture around them simply was hybridized whether they liked it or not.

Yes. Why the hell wouldn't they be? I'm living and breathing proof that they are

""That I'm just as American as a White person with ancestors who fought at Gettysburg -- or Brandywine?""

Why not? American identity isn't based on ethnicity or ancestry, it's about how you choose to identify. Also there were in fact Asian Americans and even South Asian Americans who fought in the Civil War, so don't try to pull that shit on me, pal

There is fundamentally an American ethnicity that people know exists when they hear my accent or discover my politics and think ""well he's as American as anyone else""

Except there literally isn't an ""American ethnicity"". All the commonalities and connections that define being American are cultural and not ethnic. Ethnic ties involve familial and blood ties, which aren't at all needed to be American.

""Those divisions are recent, but real ---- but we can't admit that just maybe Danes are a nation? And that MENA/Central Asian peoples who arrive there simply are not Danish in less than one generation?""

Really? Because I moved to the States from India when I was five and I'm a fully integrated American. My older brother was 18 when he moved here and he's a fully integrated American.

2561,"Not sure if it's relevant, but Shakespeare was running around a long time ago:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare

&gt;Baptised:	26 April 1564

And color separation is not uniform across languages:

[Wikipedia: Blue-green distinction in language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_distinction_in_language)

&gt;Many languages do not distinguish between what in English are described as ""blue"" and ""green"" and instead use a cover term spanning both. To describe this English lexical gap, linguists use the portmanteau word grue, from green and blue, which the philosopher Nelson Goodman coined in his 1955 Fact, Fiction, and Forecast to illustrate the ""new riddle of induction"".
&gt;
&gt;The exact definition of ""blue"" and ""green"" may be complicated by the speakers not primarily distinguishing the hue, but using terms that describe other color components such as saturation and luminosity, or other properties of the object being described. For example, ""blue"" and ""green"" might be distinguished, but a single term might be used for both if the color is dark. Furthermore, green might be associated with yellow, and blue with black or gray.
&gt;
&gt;According to Brent Berlin and Paul Kay's 1969 study Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution, distinct terms for brown, purple, pink, orange and grey will not emerge in a language until the language has made a distinction between green and blue. In their account of the development of color terms the first terms to emerge are those for white/black (or light/dark), red and green/yellow.[1]

And historically, some of the languages used on the British Isles have not distinguished between silver and the color of the sea:

&gt;Celtic
&gt;
&gt;The Welsh word *glas* is usually translated as ""blue""; however, it can also refer, variously, to the color of the sea, of grass, or of silver (cf. greek γλαυκός). The word *gwyrdd* (a borrowing from Latin *viridis*) is the standard translation for ""green"". In traditional Welsh (and related languages), *glas* could refer to certain shades of green and grey as well as blue, and *llwyd* could refer to various shades of grey and brown; however, modern Welsh is tending toward the 11-color Western scheme, restricting *glas* to blue and using *gwyrdd* for green, *llwyd* for grey and *brown* for brown.

2623,"It's not a counter-argument to the idea that a fascist party can get a good result. I was specifically responding to the idea that Germans voted to have Hitler in power. 

Most Germans voted against him, but successive illegal usurpations of power (or ones that were retroactively or exceptionally made legal under the threat of violence) by the NSDAP took all the power for Hitler. 

Most of these power grabs were never subject to the public's vote, or really even public discussion where the opposition would have been able to speak freely. 

So basically, most of Hitler's power did not result from the legal process of government according to the result of an election.

I'd say it's quite reasonable to expect that should a modern fascist party come to some power by winning an election, they would probably start to undermine or outright violate the law in order to seize more power, and use violence and threats to accomplish this, until they were in a position to control public discourse and elections in a way that negates the possibility of a genuine opposition. After all, this is what fascists generally do.

As for whether the SD are fascists, I suspect it's similar to the corresponding political movement here in Finland, with lots of ""I'm-definitely-not-a-Nazi-wink-wink-I-just-like-uniforms-and-hate-minorities-and-art-and-education"" sort of people even among the leadership, but most of their voters are ill-informed and frustrated with politics to the point where they'll commit to a protest vote against their own interests and follow it up with complete apathy regarding the inevitable fall-out of the electoral success of a bunch of self-serving, incompetent liars, leaving everyone else to deal with the mess.

2640,"&gt; I think you don't know how much less of a European identity Nordic people have.

And I kindly suggest that you make too much of it. Two generations ago, the Germans and French didn't think they had anything in common since they were ""hereditary enemies"". Look at where we're now. (Hint: It's better, and my ancestors who were put in their graves by both ends of that stick would certainly agree.)

&gt; On top of that we are generally not happy when the EU tries to lower our food standards, regulate fishing and other things like that.

Who is? 

I know exactly what you're talking about, I'm being served the sentiment almost daily, since it's a favourite German pastime to mock the EU for its pedantic regulations, from the curvature of bananas to our beloved light bulbs. 

At the same time, Germans think highly of Bismarck, who did the *exact* same thing when he unified the myriad standards of German states into one set of imperial standards, thereby creating a single German market and doing wonders for trade, industry and commerce. 

It's what you have to do when the task at hand is to create a single market out of 27 different markets separated by all kinds of national standards.

And that's only the economic side of it, yet there is a political and geo-strategic side as well: The question is whether you Nords will have a seat at the table when it comes to administering these things. If you choose to have one, you'll get the chance to have a say in designing the future. If you don't and you choose the way of the Brits, the future will be designed nonetheless, but without you having a say or a hand in it.

As the UK will soon find out, you *will* be subject to all kinds of 'regulations' whether you sign on to them or not, since the conformity pressure of markets way bigger than yours isn't waiting for you to come around.

The other day skynews made a freedom of information request forcing several councils to release their internal findings into ramifications for brexit [https://news.sky.com/story/councils-preparing-for-social-unrest-amid-brexit-uncertainty-11455918](https://news.sky.com/story/councils-preparing-for-social-unrest-amid-brexit-uncertainty-11455918). 

Seems reasonable, the councils aren't giving out this information but they were forced to do so,  but apparently this is biased and evidence that PROJECT FEAR is ruling the day and only putting the spin on the negative sides of Brexit [https://twitter.com/DKShrewsbury/status/1025313794665447426?s=19](https://twitter.com/DKShrewsbury/status/1025313794665447426?s=19).  

yesterday our health minster came out and said to make up for NHS black holes after brexit (15% of the staff are from the EU) we will knock a year of training off of their education, pretty reassuring right? because if anything you want your already overworked and under trained doctors to have less training

The cognitive dissonance over here is real, and I think more people are coming around to the fact that this may not be the best idea, and it's why you are seeing the hardcore Brexiteers screeching that 2nd refs will subvert democracy, because they know that having a vote today with the knowledge what we know now and how interconnected most of our vital services are most people (especially those in the middle and those who is was mainly a protest vote against austerity from the Conservative government) don't want to fuck with that as shown with the top google result in the UK after the referendum 'what is the EU?'.   Now probably most people can at least tell you a couple of things that the EU does and how it would be a bad idea to reverse it overnight.

In conclusion, it's been great and so long and thanks for all the fish.

True, China is going more market than usual, but describing it as capitalist is ridiculous. Half of its economy is state-owned (and not even a less-profitable part).

2803,"&gt; OMG. This is the quantity that EU is already selling to Ukraine. Not because Ukraine only needs 15 bcm, but because it's the quantity they are able to buy! They were consuming 66 bcm in 2008, now they are consuming 32, so like half of it; do you really think that economy of Ukraine suddenly became less dependent on gas by half? Domestic production is basically the same, about 15 bcm, so it does not mean they became less dependent on import or so as you are trying to imply

Ukraine has had a severe economic shock in the last years. All economic shocks reduce energy consumption. Gas consumption in Ukraine has been falling since 1991, more than halving by 2009 and almost halving again by 2017. This is not simply because of Russia. This is very clearly a long-term trend.

Dependency on import has actually fallen, the numbers prove it. Wether that's because the economy has become less energy intensive or because the economy itself has shrunk (or because Ukraine cannot afford more gas) is irrelevant. What's relevant is the demand for imports at the prices offered to Ukraine.

&gt; You don't see a contradictions in what you are saying by just looking at table you yourself linked? Just take a look at 2009 year, when suddenly ""Ukraine dependency on gas import"" suddenly dropped by 27%. What happened that year? Russia cutted off transit to Ukraine for about a month, so they were forced to use their own stock.

Not at all. In 2009 first of all the dependency dropped because of the global recession, don't know if you've heard of it (as you can clearly see by the fact that not only imports dropped, but also total consumption), and then also because Russia cut off transit to Ukraine.

&gt; It was a typo. I meant ""to Ukraine"" not ""via Ukraine"". But transit via Ukraine is dropping year by year. Russians are planning to transit only 10-15 bcm via Ukraine instead about 93 bcm as last year.

Whatever you meant doesn't change the situation. Russia will use Ukraine less as a transit nation. Yes, we already know that. It's practically the only ""semi-negative"" consequence I already mentioned.

Anyway Russian gas exports to Ukraine (not via Ukraine) are starting again this year, your own article said that. So it's clear that Ukraine will have multiple sources (Russia directly, since gas exports are restarting this year, or Russian gas indirectly via the EU, as has already been happening for years).

I also like you you completely ignored the fact that you were wrong regarding the 1€ billion supposed losses, and the profitability of reselling Russian gas.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/94i23q/polish_stateowned_firm_lotos_has_signed_a_deal/e3m206f/,Etain05,1533416377

It is clear that there was a very small number of army members who comitted crimes. Those criminals however were, even during the war, persecuted by the Croatian government. The ""government"" of the RSK however, organised, approved and comitted war crimes and ethnic cleansing against Croats on their territory. And for Tudjman: He did not want ordinary Croatian Serbs to disappear, he only thought that those who didn't want to live in Peace with Croats in a democratic country, who only see Croats as Ustasa and comitted Crimes during in the RSK, should leave the country. Most of those tapes were well known during his lifetime but people took them out of context.

2. May I ask you what they wanted to protect them? Against a democratic government who followed the rule of law and wanted to protect the human rights of all of its citizens? The Serbian government spread lies and fake news about the new Croatian government so that they had the support to start a war. If you can't read or understand a source, why don't you ask? Why do you assume, even if you don't understand a single word, that it is highly suspicious?

3. Nope, Mladic publicly announced that (Proof: https://youtu.be/uZhItUGqWG8?t=25m37s )

2856,"You already have those 2 things, though.

1- There are countries with more and less integration inside the European Union. Except it's all a big mess right now, without it being a real federation, like it should, where state divergences might occur, but it's all under a de jure leader, instead of it being just a shadowy one, a de facto leader, like we know France/Germany and the big corp power to be.
We're getting all the troubles and just getting half of the rewards.. while leaving Europe in a fractured state... it doesn't make sense.

2- Our votes all count the same: nothing. It's all about public perception and lobbying power. Democracy is just a veil.. an illusion of power given to the people. It's non-existent nor is it actually a good thing in 80% of the cases. Sure.. there are some things where logic doesn't need to be applied.. (which colour do you want the walls to be, or something like that)... But... to questions that require a rational answer, leaving it up to the majority of the randomly intelligent/ignorant people, is not a logical decision...

Like Churchill said: The best argument against democracy is a 5 minute conversation with the average voter.

Rational decisions should be arrived through logic..(where, sure, everyone should be allowed to participate... but only with a structured argument.. not just with a ""pulled out of the ass"" opinion.. or someone with 0 knowledge in something having voting power on that subject.) 

Democracy would be a dictatorship of the ignorant masses... except, again.. that's not how it works as I said... it's just a decoy. Things get ""voted"" on the backstage of the ""democratic institutions"". (For an example of that just check out the Eurogroup and the European Commission..)

2900,"It was the same in Russia/USSR. VDNKh (Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy) is a great example of it. It was supposed to show off Soviet achievements and it was built in pompous imperial Stalin's style. Then Khruschev declared war against ""architectural extravagances"" of Stalinist era, buildings with decorations were considered tacky and outdated, so most of old pavilions on the exhibition were reconstructed into modernist cubes or at least cleared from decorations. And now old is cool again, while Khruzhev's modernism is not seen by masses as something valuable at all -- so recently false facades were removed and VDNKh is being reconstructed to its 1954 form.

2907,"Well let's put it this way the Turks had wars with and vassalised the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova from the XVth century onwards. The Principalities had to pay ever increasing taxes to the Turks but other than that were allowed to keep their internal autonomy, keep their religion and pretty much go about existing as semi-independent states. Despite countless rebellions agains the Islamic Turks which ended up being defeated they never decided that they needed to destroy, wipe out or convert the local population.

Similarly, in Transilvania even though the Hungarians were in control and held the majority Romanian population in lower social positions and tried to assimilate them and tried to conver them to catholicism they did not go too far. The Romanians still had their own orthodox churches, their own local nobles, their own identity and culture. It went so far that by the Austro-Hungarian compromise there were even Romanian deputies in the Hungarian parliament.

By contrast, the Orthodox Russians came in as supposed liberators of their Orthodox brothers but in fact brought about more subjugation than ever before. In 1812 Russia broke away a part of the Principality of Moldova known as Bessarabia. This part of Moldova has changed sides several times but spent a good part of the 1812-1990 period as part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. As part of this time the native population suffered deportations, executions, famine and most important of all de-nationalision.

In summary:

\- Transilvania - almost a millenium ruled by the Catholic Hungarians yet by the 19th century it was the most thriving part of the Romanian culture and the Transilvanian Romanian intellectuals pretty much kick-started the age of Romanian nationalism (these guys were even more nationalist than the Romanians from Wallachia and Moldova)

\- Wallachia and Moldova - over 400 years ruled by the Islamic Ottomans yet they retained all their culture and identity and in the 19th century forged a common identity and exeprienced a cultural awakening just like all the other Balkan peoples

\- Bessarabia (now known as the Republic of Moldova) - less than 200 years ruled by the Orthodox Russians and today we have the poorest country in Europe, torn apart about their identity, we have people speaking the same language arguing whether it should be called Moldavian or Romanian, we have today the Moldavian Orthodox Church fighting with the Russian Orthodox Church on who has more authority in the Rep of Moldova...and the list goes on. While Romania keeps integrating into the EU (still slow but huge differences) developing and attracting more foreign investment, the youth are starting to slowly develop into a small burgeoning middle class etc in the Rep of Moldova we have dieing country with literally no hope to go forward.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/94g5j8/russian_meddling_in_greece_divides_traditional/e3lv6oy/,Lexandru,1533409246

3003,"I typed out this comment calmly while watching youtube videos on the side, so while it may look too long, I had the luxury of just noting down little ideas that popped in my head over the past two hours.             
     
- Don't be a hero. Don't pick fights you can't win, but do give the people that are more powerful than you any ammunition you may provide.       
     
- Leak any instance of corruption anonymously to as many prosecutors or judges as possible. One of them is bound to be a professional and have the ethics to prosecute. Orban is a legal guy... you need people who can dance his dance. This stuff is above my and your pay level.            
       
- Remain calm. Don't fall in the traps of sensationalism put out there. Some people employ agitprop, the tactic also used by the former USSR. The word says it all: It's propaganda *only* meant to agitate. It can be made up, or it can be factual, but it's main purpose is to rile up people, and to make people cynical about the factuality of everything. Some people want you to overreact, and then use the overreaction to say: ""See: that's how hysterical our critics are.""       
       
- Talk to people in real life, not only online. Maintain casual friendships across the entire political spectrum. Let them know that not everyone fits in the agitprop caricature of ""liberals"". The enemy of black-and-white thinking is the colour grey. Your main aim should be to make people wonder how they would feel if a party *they* hate or distrust (from wherever it is in the political spectrum) comes to power and then uses all the powers Fidesz now has created for the dominant party.         
      
- Don't become a cynic. Sarcasm is great and funny, but cynics are people that have resigned themselves to the situation.      
      
- Expect very little from politicians from the other European countries. The politicians in other European countries have very little power to move Hungary back to a functioning democracy with plenty of checks and balances. The boogeyman of the all powerful EU that EU-sceptics talk about is actually a slow, lumbering giant, that only reacts years after the damage has been done. In addition, criticism by the EU or its member states is used by people like Orban (or PiS in Poland) as an example of ""they're trying to get us"".      
      
- Expect very little from citizens from the other European countries, in particular citizens of western European countries who have no history of a sudden shift to authoritarianism. In that sense, a lot more people from the former Warsaw Pact countries that have some frame of reference of how their countries became authoritarian during the interbellum know how  authoritarianism sneaks up on you. I think only Czechoslovakia remained a democracy between WWI and WWII. People from Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, ~~UK, Sweden,~~ Denmark, Norway only experienced dictatorships imposed from the outside when they were occupied by Nazi Germany. [Edit: and people from UK, Sweden or Switzerland have almost no frame of reference about authoritarianism.]
             
- Distrust people who try to undermine the case against Orban by singling out a few minor details that they say can't be proven. These people don't want a fair debate, they just want to make you doubt the overwhelming mountain of evidence that Hungary is becoming undemocratic by trying to cast doubt on a detail that you may have gotten wrong. Climate change sceptics, holocaust deniers, and critics of the theory of evolution employ the same tactic.     
      
How to argue with a Darwinism sceptic: ""Imagine the theory of evolution is like the hard cover of a book within which chapters are supposed to fit. While it is true that there are still many missing fossils that show every step of how each species evolved, all the fossils we have found until now fit in that cover.""     
How to argument with a holocaust denier: ""Imagine the theory that the Holocaust did take place is like the hard cover etc.""     
How to argue with a climate change denier: ditto.     
how to argue with an ""Orban is turning our country away from democracy"" denier: ditto.     
     
Everything that has happened fits into the hard cover of: ""Orban wants Fidesz to remain in power forever"".      
People who doubt this, ask them: ""Show me what Orban has done the past decade that makes a change in political power more probable, that makes the election process more transparent, that makes the courts more independent, makes the media more autonomous from political influence?""

Why would agriculture suffer? There wouldn't be mobility where it wouldn't make sense. It's just an alternative. Instead of paying rent for your flat, car and/or subway ticket, you'd spend a similar amount for renting a mobile home and access to parking and charging places.

Fuel wouldn't be a problem with electromobility and charging stations for electric cars being build already before something like this.

Only Ukraine had a significant voice in the USSR and many leaders came from there. Other republics were had their voices drowned out. In all fairness even with voting their smaller populations would cause them to lose their voice -- and also with Russia being practically the only net contributor to the budget along with the Baltic republics, but realistically speaking Russia exercised its power to monopolise whenever it was important. It was not an equitable arrangement. It was a Russian-dominated power block.

Lots of laws are made as reflexive rejections of the previous order, social laws are made in reaction -- whether right-wing reaction of conservatism and seeking to preserve the older order, or left-wing reaction of wanting to tear down older institutions wholesale due to the perceived antiquated nature of the order, as well as its anti-progressivism. If you start picking apart social progress, things are gonna look pretty dark, lots of great strides in social progress were made for reasons other than altruism.

Nobody really liked the gays in the 1920s. Weimar Republic was somewhat famously tolerant, but even they had a [law on the books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph_175), which coincidentally remained until 1994, *after* USSR collapsed, despite efforts to remove it. German flag confirmed new banned flag at concerts? Oh, and you know what, I think I remember a certain leader of Germany that famously killed countless gays specifically for being gay, not just enemy of the state!

In fact, now that I'm reading this about West Germany: 

&gt;Between 1945 and 1969, about 100,000 men were indicted and about 50,000 men sentenced to prison. The rate of convictions for violation of Paragraph 175 rose by 44 percent, and in the 1960s, the number remained as much as four times higher than it had been in the last years of the Weimar Republic.[33] Many arrests, lawsuits, and proceedings in Frankfurt in 1950–1951 had serious consequences

this is actually much worse than what happened to gays in the USSR after 1953. Now, I know someone is gonna wanna shout whataboutism, but that's pure horseshit. You can't single out USSR as somehow the enemy of homosexuality when arguably USSR was more progressive in many regards. Again, Stalin was bad and yes, he killed many, but again, he did so wholesale and was renounced by the Party as soon as they were able to get rid of him - something that Lenin fought until his death, also likely Stalin's work. All social views are relative -- meaning, you can only examine how bad/good, how progressive/regressive something is by observing what others do.

3142,"&gt;the same doesn't apply to you because Yugoslavia didn't exist as a country anymore and it was confirmed by the international community. You don't need to seize a country and recognize it as your own just like that, it has to be recognized internationally which was not the case with RPS. 

Yugoslavia still existed in 1991 and in the first chunk of 92. And the second is my point. Both Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia and RSK's from Croatia were illegal, yet Croatia was recognized and the other not.

&gt;How the RPS was not better?? There are many reasons to explain why Croatia was recognized as a State and RPS was not. There is a historircal continuity with the State of Croatia that doesn't exist with RPS. Croatia was a medieval kingdom, then in personal union with Hungary and Austria, so when it recognized its independance, it made it far easier for the international community to recognize it as a State, same can't be said with RPS. It doesn't matter what you think about Yugoslavia at the time because it was not even a country anymore. How is it even a country when only Serbia wants to be part of it lol? 

That's not important here. We're talking about legality according to the Yugoslav constitution. Both were illegal. And if you really care, RSK also has solid continuity, form Military Frontier.

As for why Croatia was recognized and RSK not, the answer is simply, it was in the interests of the West, which with the end of the Cold War was left unopposed as the most powerful force in the world. 

And again, Yugoslavia was still a thing until 92, SFRY that is, FRY continued until 2006.

&gt;And If I apply your logic. Serbia's war of independance against turkish empire was illegal and shouldn't have happened? 

Not sure the Ottomans had a constitution then but if they did, it was most likely illegal. Should it have still happened? Yes. Same for Croatia and RSK. I fully agree that Croatia should've seceded from Yugoslavia, keeping them there is stupid, but so is keeping the Serbs in Croatia.

&gt;Guardian: The Russian national had been hired by the US Secret Service and is understood to have had access to the agency’s intranet and email systems, which gave her a potential window into highly confidential material including the schedules of the president and vice-president.  
&gt;  
&gt;Secret Service: \[such employees\] have never been provided or placed in a position to obtain, secret or classified information... \[they\] work on, and support, only projects with the intent of providing and/or sharing the information with the Russian government in furtherance of Secret Service and USG interests.

Who cares what she was ""provided"" with. What did she *have*?

&gt;Guardian: the RSO sounded the alarm in January 2017, but the Secret Service did not launch a full-scale inquiry of its own. Instead it decided to let her go quietly months later, possibly to contain any potential embarrassment. The woman was dismissed last summer after the state department revoked her security clearance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Secret Service: In mid-2017, U.S. State Department personnel, who manage the employment process and vet all FSNs, advised the U.S. Secret Service the access authorization for a FSN working at the direction of the U.S. Secret Service, would not be extended following the completion of a scheduled security update.  The employee’s access to the Secret Service Moscow Resident Office was promptly discontinued.

Did you hear about it in January or not?

&gt;Guardian: The dismissal came shortly before a round of expulsions of US personnel demanded by the Kremlin after Washington imposed more sanctions on the country. The order to remove more than 750 US personnel from its 1,200-strong diplomatic mission is understood to have provided cover for her removal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Secret Service: Reports of the timing of the individual’s termination in question and the closing of the Secret Service Resident Office in Moscow correlate in any way are false. The U.S. Secret Service Moscow Resident Office closed in August of 2017 due to lack of cooperation from the Russian government - entirely unrelated to the termination of the FSN in question.

There was no suggestion that the events were correlated, just that the timing was helpful.

3335,"&gt;You don't speak for all men too. Not every men are as insecured as you  nor feel butthurt and oppressed when we take away their ""right"" to wolf  whistle and disrespect women on the street.

I've never felt the need to wolf whistle at a woman because that isn't my modus operandi to get a female and I'm not insecure as you put it but, at the same time, I don't consider it in any way disrespectful. It's a sign of admiration that some choose to express in that way.

&gt;feminist (and normal peoole)

We do agree on something at least. You made the important distinction, feminists are not normal people.

&gt;did find this dude's act abhorrant not  because it showed that men and  women aren't physically equal (wtf?) but becausd this man beat a woman  after she responded to his direspectful behaviour. You can try to discard the context to fit your argumentation but the  truth is he catcalled the woman and when she dared to tell him to shut  up he went back and beat her).

Only feminists, like yourself, consider the catcalling to be the issue and not the actual physical assault of a man on a woman. Men are physically stronger than women so most normal people consider men who use their physical advantage against women to be loathsome.

&gt;I understand that in your little world a woman defending herself and  responding to a disrespectful behaviour would be seen as a sign of  oppression for insecure little men like you but that's not what happens  in the real world.

I don't see that as a sign of oppression. Please don't try to feminise me because it won't work.

&gt;And lmao at the passage where you shamelessly say that 'females are  achieving a higher standarf"" when every study shows how they earn less  than men even with the same diploms.

They are achieving a higher standard in education, that's a fact. More and more women are being given jobs they do not deserve just to satisfy so called 'equal equality'.

&gt;Please, leave the talking to grown up and go on [r/braincels](https://www.reddit.com/r/braincels) because, truly your discourse will have more echoes  there than here.

I've no intention of going there if you recommend it as I can imagine from your previous comments that it is just another insult. I'm an adult male and you're obviously used to getting your own way with men, probably because they have been feminised, but I'm sorry that isn't going to happen with me.

&gt;Your delusion and victimisation won't stop sane people from advocating in favour of EQUALITY between men and women

I'm sorry to be the one to burst your bubble but men and women aren't created equally. If they were you would see women have the ability to carry out exactly the same jobs as men and to the same standard. You would see them compete against each other in physical sports. You've, for some reason, developed a hatred of men and push for female equality but in actual fact what you want is female domination.",,/r/europe/comments/94011v/france_outlaws_lewd_catcalls_to_women_in_public/e3l76w6/,Angelicus_Diabolus,1533380771

It was  a generally more erratic environment. (Which as a neophile I personally found far more interesting.) Presently algorythms paved all these roads for us, which feels like an improvement, but a lot of these roads double back to where we started and effectively put us into bubbles where showing an interest in A, B and C early on will reduce your exposure to wildly different D through Z, even if, if you knew about it, you'd trade A, B and C for M in a heartbeat.

I definitely think though there should be paid subscriptions for things like facebook and google that garantee you're not tracked, you're not by default having your search results and feeds tailored to your habits and you don't get ads. These services presently don't do that mainly cause, I think, if they lose part of their tracked audience the efficacy of the whole process is reduced, plus the people with the means and willingness to spend money on such a plan are exactly the ones advertisers would want to target, so it may have to be imposed on them as law.

3421,"lol.. Do you think these people with burqas would take them off when they demonstrated?

Sorry but I also like tinted windows on my car.. its illegal for a reason to go over a certain tint.

The point is if you are wearing that its purely religious, and is fundamentalist religion. There is no room for any religion to control people muslim or otherwise, in a western country.

In any case. Its banned. And they can sit at home and ponder if allah and Muslim fundamentalist principles are worth it, or get heavy fines.

Wearing a burqa is very fundamentalist belief in the quran and Hadiths... in fact women do not have to wear them, but it’s a sign of piety, same may blowing yourself as a martyr is also a sign of piety and entry into heaven. Dying for allah, and his quest to spread sharia law.

The question is do we allow Nazi swastikas? For good reason.. no.. (despite it actually being a traditional bhudist/Taoist and even Hindu sign). I mean Europe has too much history with Nazi germany, so we ban it. In Europe it almost exclusively refers to neo Nazis. 

Whilst in japan it’s okay, because the swastika has nothing to do with Nazi germany. There are several swastikas on ancient bhudist temples.

The burqa however, is directly indicative of fundamentalist Islamic principles. Moderate Muslims will not wear these things. They are more interested in assimilating with culture of the country they are in. And yes that allows the ‘dirty local non Muslim to see their face’.

Again the burqa is not a requirement for women.. it just says in the Quran and Hadiths their piety to do so earns them respect to god. So now what about the Muslim woman not choosing to wear burqa? Is she to be judged by the Muslim community as being less pious? Less of a ‘catch’. Should she.. in a western community, as a Muslim, be judged because she is less pure? And refuses to wear one?

It’s amazing how we must respect a discriminatory religion.. if you are non Muslim, and single, how about you try ask one of these burqa wearing women on a date? Oh you will quickly find, your non-Muslim beliefs.. will make it impossible. You would be an infidel to them. Someone not worthy to the kingdom of god. 

So if a religion can not accept you.. for who you are, why should we accept it into western culture with carte Blanche?",Europe,/r/europe/comments/94aq51/first_woman_fined_in_denmark_for_wearing_disguise/e3l3sqp/,Sense13,1533373383

If you spread immigrants over more countries, then the countries that suffer the most right now will start suffering less, cause you take away part of the burden of migration resting on their shoulders.

But that resentment and anti-immigrant sentiment will still be there, although it might stabilize or even decline a little bit.

These judges should be isolated because they pose a threat to the legal order. The newest ruling is one of its kind and law students should learn how **NOT** behave on this example.

1. The composition of this court is inappropriate and two judges are retired, which means that, under the law, the ruling has no legal effect.

2. The lack of substantive jurisdiction of the court. Simply this court and any other court, has no right to decide whether the binding regulations are lawful, because it is the competence of the legislative authority and other bodies, such as the Constitutional Tribunal. Under the law, the decision has no legal effect.

3. Separation of powers is questioned. Judiciary undermines the legislative power.

4. Court is composed of a party to the proceedings, i.e. the Romans rolling in the graves. Under the law, the decision has no legal effect.

There is no need for outstanding legal knowledge, this is the foundation of the law, just as the accused is innocent until proven guilty and final conviction.

3570,"&gt; Everyone deals with suffering, so when you make a point to say you're suffering, when hundreds of millions of people have it far worse than you, will make any sane person roll their eyes. 

This guy didn't make a point to say that he's suffering, all he did was enjoy a cold water tub. You called him a bitch for no reason other than he decided to cool himself. He didn't ask for your sympathy, to which you responded that he's a bitch, you just called him a bitch. Me having this exchange with you is not me asking you to recognize that this individual is suffering, it's me trying to understand why you called him a bitch for no reason.

&gt; Anyone would agree, that INCREASING your RESISTANCE to suffering, would be an ideal scenario over DECREASING it. And any attempt of DECREASING it, is fostering a toddler whining for a tit. 

That's literally insane. Ideally, you want us to throw away all modern comforts because you think our lives are too pampered? Let natural selection do its work because the survivers will be more resilient, instead of using technology to simply eliminate the threats? No, ""anyone"" would absolutely not agree to that.

&gt; That's why ostracism doesn't work and the state has to step in to ensure social cohesion. 

I don't see how you facilitate ""assimiliation"" by trying to force someone to do what they obviously don't want. If someone fined you for not hanging out with someone you're not interested in, would you really develop a genuine friendship? No. It would make you embittered and angry that you're forced to do something you're not interested in.

Это мы не знаем. Может и возил, а может и нет. Просто об этом не известно. Про Афган как на самом деле дела были мы тож не сильно знаем. Тогда у СССР уже не так много влияния на ОВД было. В любом случаи СССР **навязал** ОВД на страны вместе со всеми остальными вещами. В случаи НАТО и всего подобного гораздо больше добровольства было, а сейчас без поддержки населения и не вступить даже.

США без всяких сомнений самое варварское государство западного образца. Но если бы не угроза с РФ, а до этого и СССР, то и влияния такого у США бы не было. Любви к США у населения Европы на самом деле гораздо меньше, чем ненависти. Но для например прибалтийских стран - не находится в сфере влияния США - суицид. ЕС не мог и не может заменить пока (а может и никогда) их.

Позиция Беларуси тоже понятна. Вы в упор к РФ, но еще меньшая страна чем мы, следовательно на вас влиять или обидеть легче. Лукошенко далеко не такой плохой диктатор как бывают конечно, но этой любви к нему у населения я понять не могу. Безусловно на западе считают Беларусь вообще кошмаром диктатуры и тут они ошибаются. Но без финансовой и экономической зависимости и помощи от РФ скорей всего она именно ей бы и была.

3821,"Well I’m personally a strong believer in right of self determination, and while people say it’s the demise of Europe etc. Ethnically homogenous states (not including new foreign immigrants) can in general work better without historical tensions getting in the way of progress. 

I don’t personally have anything against the Serbs of Bosnia wanting to become part of Serbia, but there is reasons for apprehension by many. Such as,
The kingdom of Bosnia and the borders/region of modern state have it existed, either independently or as a vassal to Ott or A-H, so some would say there is a historical precedent for the state to remain.

Tying into that theme, Bosnia has also long been considered the mixing pot of the region even before Turkish influence, being a place that once harboured catholics, orthodox, Jews and Bogamils, so some would say that it would be terribly sad to let this long lived multi cultural region to die.

The other and only reason in my opinion that has any proper clout is that the ethnic lines of modern Bosnia are unnatural, in that there were never such homogenous regions before the 1990s, when different communities were much more far flung and evenly dispersed. Some would say forced ethnic territories shouldn’t have the same influence as naturally settled ones over a long period of time. 
(Similar examples of this I can think of that people also reference this point to are: Northern Ireland, a long ago unnaturally settled region by planters, Crimea, always a diverse region but for a long time settled mostly by Tatars who were then forcefully moved away and replaced, there’s many more similar arguments as well) ",Leinster,/r/europe/comments/941ukh/border_between_kosovo_and_albania_to_be_opened/e3kjz7p/,tig999,1533344853

Western Europe has as high quality housing and kindergartens as anywhere on the planet. For some people, housing is heavily subsidized. The problem is that there aren't that many young couples. You get people aren't even getting married, much less having lots of children. Young people don't settle down and become stable until they are like 30 and then by the time they find a partner and have a kid, they are mid 30's. 

If you have any evidence that providing people socialized housing and free kindergarten significantly increases birth rates, I'd love to see it, Otherwise I'm going to assume you're just randomly taking out of your ass.

3885,"I think it’s pretty clear. As long as you don’t cause harm to others you can wear what you want. Public nudity is possibly harmful to others as I can imagine it traumatizing others, especially children. I can’t imagine somebody causing harm by covering their face. Apparently I once saw someone with a burqa when I was about 3. I was surprised and asked my mother about it, but no harm was caused. This is however a very good point, and one I have to think about.

Giving Police tools is another good point. Maybe this could be done like other special cases. Like sentences could be higher if a crime was committed when somebody is covered. Like you currently have robbery and armed robbery. There could be masked robbery. It would give police the tools to discourage the abuse of masks. Police are already allowed to ask people to identify themselves if they behave suspiciously, so I believe covering your face could probably be considered suspicious.

I’m not going to go into the face-tracking. It’s 03:30 here and I’m too tired to think of good arguments on such a complicated topic.

I understand you disliking Islam. I just don’t think it’s that black and white. I’ve seen Christians acting more backwards than most Muslims would ever act.

Another point I'd like to bring up, that might not be as politically correct or what not, is that the vast majority of humans have an inherent need for mobile storage. The work that society expects from its citizens or even the mere survival of a person transporting him/herself sometimes requires mobile storage, many times in the form of bags, which is why they are a necessity. Unfortunately this also carries with it the risk of individuals sometimes abusing these tools of mobile storage, and as a society we have decided that everyone has a certain right to privacy. Fair enough, this is an area where ideals and practicality meet head to head and a compromise has to be, and has been made. In the case of the burka however, it doesn't fill any inherent need or function in society, besides some individuals need for religious gratification and whatnot, however what it also does is provide another venue for harmful individuals to threaten other people. Now, this is a matter of opinion, but in my opinion, one individuals need for religion should never compromise another individuals safety. Because of that, I think, if we're being completely honest, it would be fair then to forbid such an item from being worn.

4123,"While that was a problem, it run much much deeper.

One of the issues was that civil manufacturing kept falling behind as time went by. One of the main reasons was that socialism/communism system restricts startup-style innovation. Which is relatively easy in modern capitalism. If some bright dude has an idea, he is free to pursue it. Either using his own capital from previous ventures or raising capital from people who have it. And they have incentive to take risky opportunities because inflation.

Meanwhile in USSR anything like that needed sign off from high-up nomenklatura. Sometimes nobody wanted to sign off risky stuff and risk their career. Sometimes they had over motives, e.g. undercutting industries they're related to in one way or another. The result was that innovations were next to non-existent. Except for military stuff.

Even in non-centrally-planned socialistic model, it'd be hard to drive innovations. A startup would need to get initial tooling and whatnot. But they wouldn't have capital and there would be no place to acquire capital. So the only way to innovate would be inside of existing companies. Which would lead to similar issues as in central planning.

Quality was a big issue as well. Most of the produce was garbage. There was no incentive to produce better thing. Prices were set anyway. Wages too. Making more quality produce was essentially wasting time and resources with little benefit.

Decentralised non-socialist system may get away from this issue. But it'd run into another issue fast. Let's say 2 factories are competing. Both workers-owned. One is making quality items and the other is making garbage. Soon one factory may be able to rise prices because everybody would want their produce. While the other one would be forced out of business. End-game would be that the better factory would take over the other one. Essentially their knowledge would be their intellectual capital. Naturally they'd want to get paid for their intellectual capital. And spread it more and more. Give it enough time and we'd be in capitalism. Of course, there could be a lot of safeguards protecting them from benefiting. But limit too much - and there will be no will to innovate and produce quality items. Don't limit it enough and you'll have people acquiring capital.

Soviets kinda failed in both ways. Their system didn't motivate regular people causing shitty produce. But there were quite a few loopholes for industrious people to acquire black market capital.

Another issue is party system. Single party system is prone to become nomenklatura-ish. If you need to go through party structure to get to any office, it's super easy for like minded people to take it over. But after it's established, it's next to impossible to bring it down. Even collapse of USSR didn't bring down corrupted nomenklatura - many soviet times leaders became businessmen and/or politicians in 90s.

Meanwhile multi-party system is hardly possible in socialism/communism. It's just matter of time when someone would come up with idea to introduce anti-socialist/communist policies. Of course, there could be a list of ""no-go"" laws. But existence of such list is prone to be abused. Either people would find loopholes or it'd enforce essentially one-party system.",Lietuva,/r/europe/comments/93f4gv/what_do_you_know_about_the_soviet_union/e3jx0ix/,mantasm_lt,1533323101

There was also a lot of talking about what will Poles who are in UK do after Brexit. Some said that they will move away. Bt than, where? Not home probably. They are used to different standard of living now. Elsewhere? Language barrier will be a key. Unskilled guys with some English could find work in UK. Skilled people worked in their fields. For example, where could Polish doctor move from UK? Everywhere he will need the local language (which is understandable of course). That's why more people went to UK than anywhere else in EU.

Well, even if that's true. Surely just shooting someone once is less dangerous than shooting someone several times? Even if we agree they can't shoot him in the leg... how about just shooting him once and then see if he's still aggressive before shooting him a few more times?

\&gt; ""Perhaps the most disturbing allegation of all is that the weapons complex in Samarra included gas chambers (which German engineers named “inhalation chambers”), which were built to be large enough to test the poison gas on human POWs. TUI, it is alleged, supplied the complex with incinerators “for animal carcasses” to dispose of the gas chamber test subjects.""

or

\&gt; As part of Project 922, German firms helped build Iraqi chemical weapons facilities such as laboratories, bunkers, an administrative building, and first production buildings in the early 1980s under the cover of a pesticide plant. Other German firms sent 1,027 tons of precursors of mustard gas, sarin, tabun, and tear gasses in all. This work allowed Iraq to produce 150 tons of mustard agent and 60 tons of Tabun in 1983 and 1984 respectively, continuing throughout the decade. All told, 52% of Iraq's international chemical weapon equipment was of German origin. One of the contributions was a £14m chlorine plant known as ""Falluja 2"", built by Uhde Ltd, a UK subsidiary of a German company; the plant was given financial guarantees by the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department despite official UK recognition of a ""strong possibility"" the plant would be used to make mustard gas. The guarantees led to UK government payment of £300,000 to Uhde in 1990 after completion of the plant was interrupted by the first Gulf War. In 1994 and 1996 three people were convicted in Germany of export offenses.

\&gt; TUI, Karl Kolb, Heberger, Auchi, GMH, and later affiliated companies and CoConspirators Water Engineering Trading GmbH (“WET”), Pilot Plant, Melchemie, Van Anraat, Protec and De Dietrich each maintained offices and/or placed employees and managers, in Baghdad, the Samarra complex, the Fallujah complex, and other places within Iraq, during the Conspiracy. 22. By 1982, the United States government discovered that Karl Kolb, Pilot Plant, TUI and Heberger were supplying the Saddam Regime with unlawful chemical weapons and/or building facilities for the production of chemical weapons and pressed the West German government to stop the flow of materials and chemicals needed for the chemical weapons. 23. As a result of the American pressure on the West German government, West Germany adopted the 52nd Regulation of 14 May 1984, subjecting five additional chemical substances to licensing requirements and the 53rd and 56th Regulations of 6 August 1984, which referred to factories, and equipment which were intended for use in the production of certain chemical substances which could be used to produce chemical weapons. These regulations were intended to halt the exports of materials to be used for producing unlawful chemicals weapons in Iraq by German companies, including Karl Kolb, TUI and Heberger. 24. In order to conceal the Conspiracy and circumvent the German export controls, the TUI, Karl Kolb and Heberger recruited and conspired with French and Dutch companies, including defendants Protec S.A., De Dietrich, Melchemie, Banque Continentale du Luxembourg and Frans van Anraat, each of whom became necessary and vital components of the conspiracy. 12 25. Prior to the Conspiracy, the Saddam Regime did not possess chemical weapons and did not have the expertise or capacity to produce chemical weapons. Without the participation of each of the Defendants, and in particular the ability to use the chemical weapons of mass destruction produced in the Conspiracy, the Saddam Regime would not have been able to commit the genocide of the Kurds in the Kurdish Region of Iraq, including the crimes against the Plaintiffs, each of the persons listed on Appendix A, and all of their respective family members.",Here to rep 'Murica to our Euro Allies,/r/europe/comments/93xfz2/a_jet_sale_to_egypt_is_being_blocked_by_a_us/e3jfk19/,vmedhe2,1533308643

The Romanian side insists Serbia is dividing Romanians into Romanians and Vlachs. In other words, they're trying to make us encourage Vlachs to declare themselves as Romanians and speak Romanian/educate themselves in Romanian.



I've met 2-3 Vlachs and never in my life have I heard we're serbifying them against their will. They speak Serbian and consider themselves both Vlach and Serb on their own will. But Romania is adamant that they're (well, you are) Romanians and therefore don't recognize Vlach identity and language. Not to mention how funny that is considering we also have an actual Romanian minority.

So, apparently, we picked a bunch of ""Romanians"" randomly and decided to make them a whole new ethnicity that *totally* didn't exist before. Yeah, let's just make these Romanians Vlachs for the lulz. Also let's make them speak Serbian primarily. That'd be a blast.

The former communist bloc countries should have strengthened their democratic institutions on their own before applying to the EU, and I think Serbia is just as bad as a candidate as Hungary or Poland. 

I don't think that your democratic institutions are strong enough and your population sufficiently attached to them to resist a Serbian Orban in case an economic crisis happens, a new wave of refugees, etc.

Two polls with no change for Merkel's party(INSA, GMS) two polls with a one point loss (Emnid, Infratest) and one with a one point increase (Forsa).

All changes were within the margin of error and the average is around 30 percent. One point more and they would essentially be within the margin of error of the last election. 

For the AfD we has two with no change (INSA, Emnid), two with a one point decrease (GMS, Forsa) and Infratest with a one point increase.

All changes are within the margin of error and they are on average 3 points up from the last election, which is - again - not far from the margin of error of these polls.

We should keep in mind that there is currently no ongoing federal election campaign and 35% are undecided because of that. 

During the last election we had 75% turnout, which was not especially high, because Merkel was so much ahead of Schulz that  Schulz had essentially no chance to become chancellor and that was reported like that weeks before the elections.

With 35% undecided, no ongoing federal election campaign and no candidates, one point changes in one direction or the other are essentially meaningless.

Neither Spain nor Italy have an intra-EU trade deficit. Greece does but not to a huge degree.

Trade imbalances within the Eurozone negatively impact mostly France. I'm not mentioning the UK because you control your own currency and therefore aren't directly affected by monetary union.

The imbalance between France and Germany is a serious problem, caused at least to a significant degree by Germany's low-wage supply-side policies after 2003. The policies themselves are similar to those of Britain mind you: low taxes on business, labour market deregulation and benefit cuts. France didn't follow suit and retained strong wage growth for many years.

4715,"I would e surprised if they weren't different from 10 years ago.  I'm guessing that if anything the press was more free to report things 10 years ago.  

I will use the South side of Chicago as an example.  Most murders never make it into the press at all.  Some do if they are particularly tragic or brutal but many do not.  Instead you see summations where they say how many people got shot or how many died on a given weekend. 

If instead you live in an area where it is unusual for even one person to be murdered then you will likely see many articles about a single murder over time as they investigate.  It is not fear mongering to report murders.  They are relevant events  that interest people.  The game playing would be if they stop reporting them.  That implies that they are either too common to cover or that the news organization is trying to push a specific narrative.

Are you claiming that murders are now too common for Swedish media to bother or are you claiming that Swedish media is pushing a political narrative?  

Either way it is easy to look at the statistics.  Rape can be defined many ways but murder is pretty much a yes or a no.  You could play games with suicides or list some questionable deaths as something else but I think it is normally pretty clear if it was murder or not.

so fuck the ones that are forced? Even if only 10% are forced, is that not enough to be concerned?

except that being forced to wear it is much much worse than not being allowed to wear it. it hampers your social life, your work life, etc. I don't think you thought very well about this issue. Yes, it's bad that some won't be able to wear it - ignoring the racists that just want all things that remember them of brown people out of their sight, no one is saying that it's not a big deal to ban the burqa. This is like coming to an abortion discussion and saying 'but you are killing the fetus'. No shit? The discussion is on whether or not it is worth it to ban it considering the negatives and positives. Just like killing a fetus is a bad thing, but I would rather kill 10 fetus than to deal with the negatives of birthing an unwanted child.

They approach a man ""acting threateningly"" while holding what appears to be a firearm. They tell the man to get rid of it, and when he doesn't and continues to act erratically, they fire. Do you really think you would have acted differently? I know I would have done the same, and gurantee you would've, too.

4968,"&gt;what is ""energy used to move people"" and ""inertia of vehicule""?

The system ""vehicle+people"" moving at a speed v has some kinetic energy. (vehicle mass) * speed^2 / 2 is the energy you need to give the vehicle to reach the target speed, and (people mass) * speed ^2 /2 is the kinetic energy you need to give to the passengers to reach speed v. I'm not talking about maintaining this speed, I'm talking about reaching it: this energy would also be needed in a vacuum.

&gt;When you accelerate the vehicule you use energy. But that energy then goes somewhere

Yes, its ""stored"" as Kinetic energy of the system, and dissipated (transformed to heat) when you brake. I don't see your point.

5014,"Missing parts:

The Vietnamese minister enters the plane first, followed by a part of the delegation. The abducted man gets in last, held under the shoulders to make it seem as if he was just intoxicated and being supported.

Passport control is waiting on the stairs of the plane. One of the officers does not like the number of persons boarding; documents are missing. After around 15 minutes, a white interior ministry Seat arrives at the VIP gate, and all documents are now okay.

At 2:50 pm, the plane is in the air. It flies over Poland. Slovakia informed the Poles that minister Kaliňák would be on board, but only his personal bodyguard Ladislav O. is there to oversee the flight. The ministry has not answered why he was there.

“I’m telling you again that they missed a flight, or something like that, and asked us whether we could transport them to Moscow. We had no reason to doubt it,” said Kaliňák this week when asked why the government provided the plane to the Vietnamese for a second time.

After the plane returned, stewardesses complained that the captain ordered them to hand over all cellphones so they couldn’t make pictures. 

A year later

In April 2018, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that a Slovak government plane may have assisted in the kidnapping of a Vietnamese official. Its reporters visit Slovakia and approach former Prime Minister Robert Fico in parliament. He tells them he does not have time.

On April 30, 2018, Kaliňák writes on Facebook that he cannot imagine that an official visit of a Vietnamese minister could have been used for other than friendly goals. He claims several things don’t fit into the theory of an abduction: “Firstly, the name of this prosecuted Vietnamese citizen was not on the list of travelers provided by the Vietnamese authorities. Neither did we transport any immobile patient or handcuffed individual.”

 
Thursday, May 17, 2018, Bratislava

Slovak President Andrej Kiska admits for the server Aktuality.sk that he has heard about the forcible abduction of a Vietnamese with a forged passport, but that he refuses to believe Kaliňák would be capable of any such action. But he also adds a story which illustrates that through the PM’s adviser Quang Le Hong, Fico and Kaliňák had above-standard relations with Vietnam.

“I was very surprised when, last September, PM Fico gave me a call. He’d never before called me because of an ambassador. In a very unusual, almost directive manner, he asked me to appoint Mr. Quang for ambassador. Even then, there was information that Quang was not a very reliable person. I told the PM that I would proceed as with other ambassadors. Naturally, I did not appoint him.”

(German media suspect Quang of corruption – he allegedly used to demand a thousand euros for issuing a visa.)

After the abduction, Quang became the highest-ranking representative at the Slovak embassy in Hanoi – the chargé d’affaires. Since June, he has no longer been there. The foreign ministry confirmed it recalled him for consultations to Bratislava, and based on his request, decided to end his mission. Today, he is no longer employed at the ministry. 

Monday, July 30, 2018, Frankfurt

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes that German investigators no longer doubt that Slovakia helped kidnap Trinh.

“Our generosity may have been abused,” admits Kaliňák.

Trinh Xuan Thanh received a life sentence in Vietnam. German media report that the German government is negotiating the return of Thanh, whom they granted political asylum. It should happen by the end of the summer.

For the time being, the Slovak police or prosecutors have not found a reason to start investigating the case. They claim that no crime was committed on our territory. However, the Slovak penal code says that whoever, in acting as a representative of the state, detains, imprisons, or restricts the freedom of another person, commits the crime of involuntary disappearance, even if he or she simply fails to report it.

5112,"&gt;oh boy, are you delusional one.

Did my arguments hurt you? They did didn't they? Good.

&gt;minor point - it would take a lot of time to explain you because you are so dense, and its not that important anyway.

Well great for bringing it up then if it's not important anyway. Won't have to overuse my tiny little brain with the fountain of knowledge that is your great intellect (and flawless grammar). El Oh El.

&gt;So in a liberal society a women is not allowed to decide what she wear - even when we speak about wearing something like face-cover ?

&gt;I dont think you understand what being liberal means - but not surprising because you are (judging by your opinions) very conservative.

A liberal society does not mean that anything goes and there are no rules. It's why women (or men) can't walk the streets naked. Now you can bitch and moan about how this impedes your freedom, and your deeply held believes are violated, and you won't leave the house if you can't be naked. Well too bad. Thems the rules.

&gt;yes finally - because you were spouting about European Values - and as soon as you started talking about specifics - it is clear that you have no idea what European values are.

I was perfectly clear about European values. I gave you a clear example. It was even obvious what they were when I told you what they definitely weren't. If only you used a bit more grey matter to grasp what the inverse of those would be. 

You don't even have a counter argument. ""you don't know what you're talking about"" .... really? That's the level of argumentive discourse huh? Why should I bother typing out arguments when you come with that kind of garbage 'answers'. Pathetic ... truly.

&gt;Is anyone asking that everybody must wear face cover - or that just those who wish to wear it are allowed to wear it?

&gt;You are free to not wear it, your wife, daughter, mother etc are free not to wear face-cover as you always were and always will be.

&gt;Again you do not understand the essence of what you are talking about.

It doesn't matter. The essence is that Burka/Niqab are incompatible with Western society and law. It's a disgusting, anti-female relic from the medieval past. Or at least it should be. It's a symbol of regression, posession, control and imprisonment. It has no place in modern society and the law agrees. If this is unacceptable to you you can a) never leave the house or b) move to the middle east.

&gt;you mean Afghanistan that Brits pushed into stone age, Soviets pushed even further and Americans are dancing on the graves of it all as we speak?

&gt;yup they sure are backward country - not sure why though.

There are so many countries that have been ravaged by war and conquest and still became stable democracies. Many European nations for example. I'm sick and tired of the same damn sob stories of all these failed nations. 

Neither the Brits, Russians, Americans or friggin' Ghengis Khan are responsible for the taliban or the long preceding history of its tribal wars. Talking about the taliban they also enforced the niqab. Makes you appreciate just what a disgusting piece of cloth it truly is.

&gt;? oh honey - nobody is immigrating to Europe from Saudi Arabia - they might come and buy the block you live in ant take your rent money - but they are not coming to live here - trust me - they live way better where they are now.

Hit a raw nerve did I? Yes the Saudis own some property here and there. Perverted princes come over and snort coke, let gigolos fart in their faces (true story), do pretty much everything haram and go back to their desert. Then they hire European architects for a lot of money to construct a Big Ben replica right next to their Holy of Holies. Saudi Arabia has never made an impression on the world stage and it never will.

&gt;Oh - so now you as ""liberal european values"" guy want to rewrite their religion, and tell them how to live their life completely not only how to dress in public.

&gt;are you serious?

Liberal does not mean 'pander to Islamic dogma'. And yes, all islamic rules that are incompatible with Western civilization and law are .... haram. Adapt or move.

&gt;Dude - if a women wants to wear burqa - she should be allowed to wear it - we are you hoing with this nonsense?

&gt;I dont care why she wants to wear it - its her business not mine.

I already explained this to you. Also i will skip some unrelated discussion or it'll never end.

&gt;literally just a 10x10 cm piece of textile different way of dressing than niqab/burqa. 

burqa is full body covering, not just the head/face area. In any case besides being a repressive piece of cloth its also a security risk. It's why it's banned in Morocco for instance. Those Deus Vult bastards! Oh wait!

&gt;glad you did - you were talking about European Values in which I also believe, so I was confused that we differ so much - now I know that you are pro conservative values and think that that is what European Liberal Values are.

&gt;You are one confused boy.


You don't fool anyone. You don't believe in European values. You're either a muslim yourself (my guess) or a muslim apologist. Either way, modern European values are the antithesis of Islam. The only thing conservative is the burqa/niqab. We should conserve it no longer. Oh, we don't.

5143,"&gt; his support for socialism

Many early church communities were communist in nature. Jesus even told people to share things several times. 

Acts 4:32-35: _All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need._

Sounds like commie talk to me.

&gt; his claim that helping the poor will get you into heaven. 

This sounds like a simplified interpretation of [the moral influence theory of atonement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_influence_theory_of_atonement), which was the dominant interpretation until the Reformation. Most of Jesus' teachings in the gospels are about morality.

Anyway, the pope said: ""If in the eyes of the world [the poor] have little value, they are the ones who open to us the way to heaven; they are our ‘passport to paradise’."" If we accept this metaphor, then don't forget that a passport is not enough to enter a foreign country, usually you also need a visa.

5183,"&gt; squaring what seems to be an impossible circle on Ireland.

In his article Mr. Barnier did put forward one - and only one - suggestion for solving this:

&gt; What the EU has proposed is that Northern Ireland remains in a common regulatory area for goods and customs with the rest of the EU

Effectively a border in the Irish sea.  This is unacceptable to the DUP, of course, and to some (most?) within the Conservative party; other Conservatives would happily unburden themselves of Northern Ireland if the opportunity presented itself.

This solution has always looked unlikely, and I'm surprised to see Mr. Barnier believes it is still possible even though it has already been publicly ruled out by Ms. May.  We live in interesting times.

5209,"&gt; The French construct of citizenship is the republican model, that conceives citizenship based on a common belonging to the republic and the adherence to its ideals. 

You seem to be talking about something else. How you feel about the French republic has nothing to do with whether you have citizenship or not. Citizenship is not about which country you feel you belong to. Citizenship is about being able to legally reside somewhere without a visa, being able to apply for a passport, and being able to vote in national elections.

&gt;  The Netherlands has also long followed a multicultural model.

Multiculturalism has nothing to do with citizenship. In the Netherlands, you acquire citizenship either because your parents are citizens when you're a minor, or because you're naturalized.

&gt; Who is considered citizen, or even ethnic part of your country is not as simple as that. (Are Austrians German?) 

Who is considered a citizen is very clear and easy. You are a citizen if you have acquired citizenship by birth or naturalization, and you have not lost it later. Ethnicity is much more difficult, but generally irrelevant for citizenship.

5229,"&gt;you mean high quality of life that centuries of colonization gave you (gave us that is)?

Did Sweden ever colonise anyone? Did Norway? Did Finland? Did Denmark? Did Switzerland? Did Czechia? Did Iceland? Did Austria? Did Ireland? No, yet they are all wealthy countries with a high quality of life.

Also, please give me sources as to how the West gained an high quality of life due to colonisation. Because for the case of France (cant say for others), the works of the best historians in the fields (Jacques Marseille, Daniel Lefeuvre and Bernard Lugan) clearly point that either France gained nothing or very little and more probably lost doing its colonial ventures.

&gt;why are you constantly turning this as if we allow this, somehow all of a sudden we will become Caliphate?

What you dont understand is that the islamisation of the West is an ongoing process, its gradually happening. It wont be all rainbows and icecreams one day and beheadings and burkas the next. But I can show you places in the France that are basically part of the muslim world (La Grande Borne de Grigny for example).

&gt;Like what?

Non exhaustive list :

* Islamic terrorism.

* Increase in crime rate.

* Anti white/asian/jewish racism both in words and actions.

* No-go zone that are being ethnically cleansed of non muslims. You can see how nearly all the jewish families that lived in Seine-St-Denis had to leave, most of them for Israel, fleeing their own country in which they lived for generations. I guess its hard being constantly insulted and humiliated, frequently assaulted, needing to have walls with barbed wires around your schools, etc....

* Rise in sexism and homophobia.

Lets talk about what I personally experienced : 

* I cant live in many part of town as I do not want to live in an islamic way (dress modestly, maybe even wear a hijab, be quiet, hug the wall, keep with the ramadan, not eat pork or drink alcohol (not in public at least and I would have to travel kilometers to find pork anyway), go back in the closet) and I couldnt deal with all the humilations, insecurity and dirtiness that would come with it. Coincidentally those part of town are the cheapest, so I have to spend more than what I should have in rent. I also cant go to those places as I do not want to be humiliated, harassed and have to hug the wall and be quiet.

* Anti-white racism. Do you know what its like to hear a young men tell you ""dirty white whore, do you suck dick?"" and his pals laughing when you are 12 years old? I have. Being constantly bullied because you are a ""dirty white"" and a ""fucking french"".

* Sexual harassment. I dont think I have ever been sexually harassed by someone who wasnt a maghrebi or a subsaharian man, and I am frequently sexually harassed (""all frenchwomen are whores"" amiright).

* Homophobia. I cant hold my girlfriend's hand in an ever increasing part of town.

* Insecurity. I cant take public transport or wander the streets of Paris after a certain hour without feeling unsafe (not without good reasons btw, I can see you coming from a mile away). I cant freely celebrate the french team winning the football world cup, or new year's eve, or go out when some muslim-thug (they call themselves ""islamo-racailles"") decides to evade a police control and ends up killing himself in a scooter accident as there are muslim riots in those occasions.

* Antisemitism. Even though I am not jewish I have some jewish ancestries. Do you know how hard it is to hear ""whats the difference between a pizza and a jew? The cooking time."" constantly when you are a kid and you know that some of your grand-aunts and grand-uncles where sent to the gas chamber? I have never heard, in real life, a non-muslim be antisemitic.

Basically I have to constantly be mindful, deal with humilations and harassments, self-censor myself, live in insecurity, stay in my little middle class ghetto. But I guess you dont care about any of this. As long as people who hate me get to cover their faces you are all good.

And btw, I consider myself one of the lucky ones, I have never been raped or been assaulted since I left school and I have the mean to not be forced to live in a muslim majority neighborhood (even though it can be hard on the finances at times).

&gt; so ... freethinking women but only those who think like you and have exact same ideas and visions like you (?)

&gt; all other freethinking women are not welcomed (?)

People who immigrate to the West should assimilate and follow a western lifestyle, yes. If they want to follow a muslim lifestyle they should stay/go to the muslim world. If they want to follow a japanese lifestyle they should stay/go to Japan. If they want to follow an african lifestyle they should stay/go to Africa. etc...

&gt;its easy because you are bad in hiding what your real visions and ideas are

What my real visions and ideas are is to be able to live following my western lifestyle in peace, I guess that makes me a ""white nationalist"" in your eyes or something.

Edit : Some stats that I should get into the habit of mentioning during every exchanges that I have on the subject.
Every day in France, there are 640 non-domestic sexual assaults and 1670 non-domestic battery, every 24 hours, the majority of them are done by muslims.

Edit 2 : I know you will ask me for source so here we go :

According to the ONDRP (official administration tasks with mesuring crimes) every day in France there are 640 non-domestic sexual assaults and 1670 non-domestic battery.

* According to a study publied the 29th of April 2008 in the Washington Post, 60 to 70% of France's criminal population is muslim. 

* According to Missoum Chaoui, who is the head of penal chaplaincy in Ile-de-France, 65% of prisonners are muslim. 

* According to Olivier Bobineau, sociologist specialised in religion, its 80% of prisonners who are muslims. 

* A 2000 study by Insee (official stats) said that 40% of prisonners had an immigrant fathers, most of them from the Maghreb (note that it doesnt include 3rd generation immigrants, only 2nd generation).

* According to a study published the 24th of June 2004 in Le Point, 22% of prisonners are foreigners (note it doesnt include 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants, only 1st).

* The Canonge files (which is used to track criminals), indicate that only 37% of criminals are of an ""european type"".

* A 2014 report by national representative Guillaume Larrivé indicate the 80% of prisonners are either muslim or at least culturally muslim.

* A 2006 study by the french police (renseignements generaux) indicate that 67% of gang leaders are maghrebis, 17% are subsaharian african (mainly muslim) and only 9% are native french.

You can also compare cities or provinces with each others, there is close to a 1 to 1 correlation between immigration (which is mainly muslim in France, especially for the places that I am going to mention) and criminality :

* Saint Denis ; immigration : 36.4% ; children of immigrants : 70% ; crime rate : 31.27 per thousands

* Aubervilliers ; immigration : 40.2% ; children of immigrants : 75% ; crime rate : 19.49 per thousands

* Stains ; immigration : 34.6% ; children of immigrants : 66% ; crime rate : 19.25 per thousands

* La Courneuve ; immigration : 37.2% ; children of immigrants : 74% ; crime rate : 19.02 per thousands

* Saint Ouen ; immigration : 34.1% ; children of immigrants : 67% ; crime rate : 18.54 per thousands

* Bobigny ; immigration : 33.3% ; children of immigrants : 66% ; crime rate : 17.34 per thousands

* National average ; immigration : 11% ; children of immigrants : 17% ; crime rate : 5.93 per thousands

Sources for the stats, DCPJ (official), Insee (official) and a 2005 studies by Tribalat, demographer at INED (official).

Note that it doesnt have anything to do with socioeconomical status, many studies  (Hugh Lagranges, 2010 for example) show that even at equivalent social classes, maghrebis and subsaharian africans (ie muslims) commit 3 to 4 times as many crimes as the native french. Also very poor provinces with close to no immigration (Corsica for example) have incredibly low crime rate compared to wealthier but more islamised provinces like Seine-St-Denis.

When you plot on a graph the following datas (all taken from Insee, so official and for all provinces) : GDP, immigration, poverty rate and crime rate, you can see that :

* No correlation between poverty rate and crime rate.

* Weak correlation between GDP and crime rate (richer = higher crime rate).

* 1 to 1 correlation between immigration and crime rate.

Last year in Finland, the government collected **8.34 billion €** in road traffic -related taxes, about half of which came from fuel taxes. Something like 57% of fuel price consists of various taxes here. The rest came from taxes on new cars registered, VAT on new cars, taxes on car ownership, taxes on car servicing and spares, and taxes on car insurance.

Meanwhile, the traffic infrastructure expenses last year were **1.85 billion €** in total. Yes, less than a quarter!

The point however, isn't that you can't find a way to work being able to take a call into most of your leisure activities. You probably can, with some exceptions.

The point is that having to be on-call impacts what you choose to do during what is supposed to be your leisure time. You don't do things which can't be interrupted by customers. And you make choices with this in mind, even if you don't think about it directly.

This is not a hard-and-fast or rigid rule for me. In my personal life I will take calls when it's necessary during non-business hours. It's rare so it's not an issue. 

But if a company expected me to be on-call all the time, it would be an issue.

5263,"&gt;maneuver themselves into positions where they can maximize the amount of abuse 

That is wishful thinking. If you can find evidence that people with predilections for abuse are choosing these occupations, let's discuss that, but I've not seen it. This problem would be a lot easier to solve if it worked that way.

What I think you will find instead is that people, who have no history of abuse or sexual deviance, are then put into really weird, extremely high stress situations, such as NGO workers in a refugee camp, and suddenly their behavior goes off in an awful direction.

Look at the situation in America with the child detention centers. We are finding sexual abuse committed by individuals who passed many thorough background checks in a country obsessed with them. Something very strange occurs when humans are institutionally dehumanized, and how people relate to those humans when in a position of power. 

The same thing happens in concentration camps. How is it that perfectly reasonable humans can be cruel guards in a camp?

There is indeed ius soli and ius sanguini. However, that is only connected to citizenship at birth. Also, most countries have a combination of them in some way.

Anyways. This does not account for the underlying theory of what citizenship and belonging is. What decides who to give citizenship to? People born here? People born to parents of that nationality? The underlying model of what constitutes a citizen can differ between countries that have ius sanguini for example. But it influences how strict you apply it, whether some ius soli is allowed. It also informs whether people can become naturalized, or if they can lose their citizenship (in the Netherlands you can lose it after not living in the Netherlands for I believe 15 years (as long as you have a second citizenship, regardless of your blood).

There's strong women, and then there's trying to be something you're obviously not. Funny enough, the strongest women I see are not feminist - because they can take care of themselves without using a tacky gender movement as a crutch to fall back on. If you don't generalize anti-feminist women as weak and submissive, you'll find a lot of them are quite assertive.

&gt;Someone who is your equal

If you mean by respect.

&gt;Isn't that actually quite ""manly""

Neither here nor there, the definition of being manly can be quite funny and broad in some places. Is being muscular and hairy manly? Or is being a stoic, dominant personality manly?

&gt;Wouldn't a weak person be someone who can't handle an equal but instead needs someone who is subservient?

What if the woman is naturally submissive? By contrast, perhaps the man is stronger with his assertiveness?

&gt;What is so strong and manly about going abroad to find some weak waif of a woman who won't talk back to you

Don't women do that with men? Maybe not going abroad, but looking for guys who are a certain way, submissive or assertive and putting themselves on a pedastal.

IIRC considering the whole vehicle the breakeven point for emission is 80 000 km, compared to a diesel engine car (thus lower/better for petrol). All considering the current (/very recent) energy mix in Germany. And this 80 000 km are obviously way less than the average lifetime of a vehicle. Not sure if they factored in battery replacements, but that shouldn't change too much I would guess.

But my point was that the energy efficiency isn't *vastly more* efficient, it's rather quite similar ([energy mix Germany](https://1-stromvergleich.com/medien/stromerzeugung-2017.png)), even though it's rather hard to count in the efficiency of renewable energy, as you don't use any wind/sun etc. up.

5499,"&gt; We didn't start altering anything. 

I don't know who ""we"" is, but there were [massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C4%8Dak_massacre), and the intervention was mean to stop those, and to prevent even worse, which would have definitely altered the status. Enacting genocide to tip the scales couldn't get ruled out after the previous experiences.

Bringing up Kiev in comparison is kinda ridiculous, since Kiev at no point has been a threat to the people of Crimea.

We can talk about geopolitical interests all day long, but those don't have any bearing on legality. And in legal matters, when it comes to Russia's Annexation of Crimea, Russia did nothing, absolutely nothing in a way that would have legitimized their actions. Simply because they don't care. 

Maybe geopolitical interests played a role in Kosovo. But geopolitical interests for sure are the only thing that played a role for Russia in Crimea, that much is certain. It's not only a weak case to claim Kosovo and Crimea are similar, it's a non-existant case. 

&gt;Again, they're quite right. It set the precedent that you can't just simply ignore international law if you so please.

No, Russia could have gotten the issue to the Security Council, they didn't. They could have tried to arrange a legitimate referendum together with Kiev, they didn't. They could have prevented war in East Ukraine by just not supporting the Seperatists, they didn't. 

There was no pressure for Russia to act in Crimea, the time wasn't running to prevent any catastrophe, their Black Sea Base was not in danger, and yet, they did what they did.

&gt;A dissolution that was over, a UN mandate under which it was still part of Serbia, a conflict that ended 9 years prior (the only major conflicts after that was 2004 pogrom of Serbs, caused by the Albanians), a decision whose end result, independence, is illegal.

The dissolution was not over, as there were still territorial conflicts going on, for years, fueled by a mindset of retaliation and revenge. If you wanna break up a fight, it doesn't matter who started what. You separate the parties. Milošević was given the chance for peace before the intervention, on similar terms like the Dayton-agreement and Kosovo would have remained with Serbia if he had accepted.

In the end, acknowledging Kosovo was then just a matter of accepting the fact, that a lasting peace couldn't be achieved without separating both parties.

&gt;Because while different in some aspects they're similar in many, including the most important, their legality, which both lack. 

What similarities? The only point you keep going back to is ""NATO ignored international law, and so did Russia"".

5513,"&gt;your point is that it's bad to ban wearing clothes. That's the premise of the debate. If it was not bad, we wouldn't be having the debate. That's why my reaction to your original comment is condescending and to say that you are missing the point. You should argue why the bad consequences out weight the good ones: not saying 'bad consequences exist'.

I'm afraid this is a complete non-sequitur and bears no relevance to the original comment. My original comment made no reference to the bad consequences of banning articles of clothing, my original comment simply pointed out the irony of a politician proclaiming to be against draconian rules on womens' clothing by himself imposing draconian rules on womens' clothing. 

That is why your reaction of condescension was unwarranted. Not only is it incredibly rude, but it is patently clear that you hadn't yourself understood the topic at hand, so your condescension made you look quite petulant and ignorant - I suppose you were attempting to convey intelligence? For future reference, condescension is not the way to do this.

&gt; if the Muslim oppression of women by other people is a non-issue because only 150 (source) wear the niqab, then it's also a non-issue that some of them want to wear it and won't be able to after the ban.

Correct, this isn't going to significantly change anyone's quality of life one way or the other. It is, however, an infringement on the rights of the individual, and it is a little concerning that this is deemed normal and acceptable for such an intangible and limited return. The cited justifications for the ban are public safety and women's rights, however a cursory glance at the situation reveals that neither is the chief concern of the people advocating this legislation - far more people are put at risk crossing roads in Denmark than are put at risk by veiled women, yet the same indignation is not directed at motor vehicle owners, for example.

&gt;I am absolutely sick of seeing so many racists on my 'side' of the discussion. All I wanted is freedom and equality, unfortunately, many of these women have accepted that they are less than men.

An unfortunate consequence of living in a free society is that you need to live alongside people who disagree with you. I may not agree or agree with someone's decision to wear a face veil, but I believe that should be the choice of the individual. They likely do not approve of my decision to drink alcohol, yet I see no problem with this, provided there are no negative consequences for wider society. In both cases (face veils and alcohol), good arguments can be made to restrict freedoms, but sensible compromises can be made.

Imagine a piston connected to an axle which is driving nothing. The piston will keep moving up and down and the axle will keep rotating indefinitely if there is no friction. (The energy has nowhere to go). There is only the transfer of kinetic energy between axle and piston. The axle will be rotating fastest at the precise moments when the piston is not moving and slowest at the moments when the piston is moving fastest.

Long story short, he is right, the only losses due to the pistons are due to friction of the pistons. That being said, it is in practice difficult to make a piston/axle system that has small friction.

5585,"&gt;Black ice, sometimes called clear ice, is a thin coating of glaze ice on a surface, especially on roads. The ice itself is not black, but visually transparent, allowing the often black road below to be seen through it. The typically low levels of noticeable ice pellets, snow, or sleet surrounding black ice means that areas of the ice are often practically invisible to drivers or people stepping on it. There is, thus, a risk of skidding and subsequent accident due to the unexpected loss of traction.

Well of course not. Most Finns live in the south anyways where it doesn't get this cold or do comfy jobs in offices and what not. But having to work in weather below -30C is very common. Kids for example drive bikes to school in under -30C temperatures. Adults who work outside still work outside and so on. Snow needs to be plowed and dogs need to be taken for a jog.

because its your freedom to wear mini-skirt event hough some religious types are against it (not muslims but christians). Or not even religious types only.

&gt; Unless you live in complete isolation then you are a part of a society and need to follow certain rules for the society to work well. 

Dictating fashion choices does not help society.

Ban on miniskirts and bikinis when. Maybe we should even separate females and males in schools and workplaces ? It would lead to more productive society in general.

I wonder why we are not doing that too - you can justify it relativly easy as greater good for society.

&gt;  This society is one that considers full face covering to be non desirable, unusual and often suspicious so that people rather it not occur, until recently the social rules have been enough but that is no longer the case and more official enforcement is necessary.

Good luck with your ""freedom of slavery"" if you are born as a slave or imprisoned in a labor camp in North Korea.

Good luck with your ""right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion"" in most of the Middle East.

First they voted in an 'outsider with business experience' who would speak his mind and get Italy on track again. Of course, he ended up spending most of his time fighting corruption trials and in the company of underage prostitutes. 

Then they went for the leaders of the moderate left who were incredibly unstable in office because the left even after 200 years cannot agree on a unified program, and their constitution ensures there are a ton of small parties than can blow up the government. 

Next they had a technocrat put in power that was forced to push through very unpopular reforms that didn't seem to benefit anyone, and then they went back to the center left, but that guy again screwed up and had to resign after an unpopular constitutional amendment failed in a referendum. 

And all this time Italy did not do anything to improve their infrastructure to make it ready for the 21st century (internet there for example is still terrible and expensive).

5795,"It depends. Political polarisation is required to some extend for change to occur. I believe what we see is the emergence of a European narrative, in fact several competing ones, and people polarising along these lines. The two most prominent ones would be Macron's EU Civic Nationalism and Orban's European Christian-Ethnopluralist Nationalism. 

Kurz and Salvini are closer to the latter of course, but I am not sure where they truly stand. Salvini for example could challenge Orban's narrative with a full-blown ""White European"" narrative that ironically uses a fully American concept of Whiteness non-existent here a few decades ago. 

My point is that for better or worse, we are witnessing the creation of a European national consciousness. This has dramatic consequences, depending on which narratives manage to gain a permanent foothold. It is quite likely that only two opposing ones will survive, forming a ""European"" Democratic and Republican party (for lack of a better analogy). 

However, our proportional parliamentary political system still has a word to say in this. As it is far less mandatory to polarise this strongly in such a system, there is hope that a truly American level of political polarisation will never take hold. Nevertheless, I believe some form of polarisation will be necessary to fully politicise the rather new and raw pan-European political sphere. 

The latter began to exist only because of the financial and then the migrant crisis. It's too young to have been fully established, and right now the wars to obtain narrational dominance are being fought.

I know you already got an answer, but to add to it: I think they count everything that does not result out of human lack of attention. A really big part of such accidents include hitting animals, like deer, that run on the road. That is more common than one would think (and not only in rural areas, if you look at the boar plague in Berlin, for example). There are a lot of fringe cases, but I guess the study takes the numbers of car insurers or the official police statistics that distinguish between the causes. A car going to shit can, depending on the specifics, be also counted ass human failure since it's the owners responsibility to maintain his vehicle.

5925,"**1**) Yes but where did the Soviets get the fuel to drive those tanks? The rubber to produce those wheels? The metal and raw materials to produce those tanks?

&gt;But this important detail is lost in the big picture where the USSR produced 102,500 tanks and self-propelled guns for the whole war (according to the official Soviet history of the Great Patriotic War, completed in 1965) [AH], whereas the US, Britain and Canada altogether supplied only 12,537 tanks and self-propelled guns [BVS]. This means the Lend-Lease aid accounts for only 11% of tanks. 

**2**) 11% of the tanks is a significant chunk. British contributions were even more important at a more important time during the Battle of Moscow.

&gt;British-supplied tanks made up in the region of 30 to 40 percent of the heavy and medium tank strength of Soviet forces before Moscow at the beginning of December 1941, and that they made up a significant proportion of such vehicles available as reinforcements at this critical juncture

**3**) How fucked was the Soviet economy post invasion?

&gt;After the loss of Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic States, the Donetsk Basinand other areas, consequently, we have much smaller area, therefore, much less people, bread, metal, plants, factories. We have lost more than 70 million people, more than 800 million tons of grain per year and more than 10 million tons of steel per year. We do not even have supremacy over the Germans either in human reserves, or in reserves of bread

&gt;There was deficiency of iron or steel due to a sharp decline of their
production. For example, steel production in the Soviet Union in 1942 fell by more than twice compared with 1940, from 18.3 to 8.1 million tons. It happened, as we know, due to the loss of steelmaking capacity in Ukraine and southern Russia

source: https://histrf.ru/uploads/media/default/0001/12/df78d3da0fe55d965333035cd9d4ee2770550653.pdf


**4**) Now how did the Soviets produce so many tanks and planes(heavily inflated)

&gt;he also thoroughly showed that the figure of 100,000+ tanks is likely a serious inflation, and that the actual proportion from Lend-Lease aid is around 24%

&gt;Armor steel had a special place in these shipments, especially in the
production of tanks, self-propelled guns and other equipment. Mobilization reserve of armored steel in the Soviet Union before the war was small and did not cover even 6-month industry needs. According to some data, 525.4 thousand tons of rolled steel of all types was delivered to the USSR under Lend-Lease. Every month, the country received about half of average amount of Soviet production of armored steel. Special steel for gun barrel drifting was also delivered.


**5**) How did the Soviets have fuel for these planes/tanks? Pay attention especially to the high octane fuel that the soviets pretty much had 0 of, but were crucial to fighters.

&gt;The US, Britain and Canada supplied the USSR with 2.586 million tonne of aviation fuel and light-fraction gasoline, 1.4 times greater than the Soviet production during the war [BVS]. That was a very big boost to the Soviet Air Force.

**6**) why didn't the Soviets starve?

&gt;As for food, the USSR lost 42 percent of cultivated land to the German offensive, including 2/3 of its grain production. US food aid amounted to roughly 10 percent of Soviet production, and while whether or not that was the difference between famine level scarcity or not gets debated, but regardless of the exact effect, it was enough food to ""to feed a 12,000,000-man army half pound of food per day for the duration of the war."" And of course, as with manufacturing, food imports freed up hands for other duties that otherwise would be needed to till the land.

**7**) How crucial was lend lease?

Zhukov and Stalins words here.

**Stalin**

&gt;Without American production the United Nations [the Allies] could never have won the war.

**Zhukov**
&gt;Today [1963] some say the Allies didn’t really help us… But listen, one cannot deny that the Americans shipped over to us material without which we could not have equipped our armies held in reserve or been able to continue the war.

I think people when viewing history ignore historical context far too often. Nearly everyone at the time thought the Soviets were going to lose, including a lot of Soviet generals most famously Zhukov saying they were really close to losing the war to the Nazis at Moscow.

Lend lease was a really big deal, it was free money. 13.4 billion isn't a lot in todays money, but adjusted for inflation(2%) it was roughly $130 billion dollars. Also factor in the US economy has grown much faster than inflation at roughly 3-4% rate post WW2 so the financial contribution was even larger than inflation adjusted numbers.

Listen to the many modern Russian historians free of Soviet propaganda talk about Lend Lease.

https://www.rbth.com/business/2015/05/08/allies_gave_soviets_130_billion_under_lend-lease_45879.html


This was a war of sacrifice in blood, production and money. The Soviets sacrifice of blood must never be forgotten and they deserve the lion share of the credit for defeating the Nazis, but without the production and lend lease, the Soviets would have been outmatched.

&gt;Kosovo Police told BIRN that in 2014, over 5 per cent of applicants were Serbs, “while this year there was around 5 per cent (4.91 per cent)”

&gt;""Interest [in joining the force] has been almost proportional” to the number of Serbs living in Kosovo as a percentage of the total population, the police insisted. The force has over 8,600 members, including uniformed and administrative staff. “The participation of the Serb community in the Kosovo Police is over 11 per cent,” Kosovo Police said.''

5970,"&gt;Despite studies providing evidence that this doesn’t even happen.

the studies that say that women choose to wear the burqa and hijab?

the daughter of a christian father also 'chooses' not to wear a short skirt. She would rather use a short skirt, but she chooses not too because she doesn't want to fight that fight.

When these women who most are stay at home moms, have no jobs or ways to support themselves, choose to wear a burqa, one of the many reasons they are choosing to do so is fear of retaliation and consequences from their families and social circles. 

This is like saying that slut-shaming is okay because women chose to not sleep around. For many women, they chose to not have sex on the first date so that they are not see as easy. it's still their decision - but doesn't mean the pressure isn't immoral, and doesn't mean they would chose the same way if the pressure was not there.

Women also chose to have sex in various degrees of pressure, and as a society if this pressure is significant we call it rape and find it immoral. 

In this case, the pressure is very immoral. these women are vulnerable, in danger of being shunned by their families who are the entirety of their safety net. They fear being sent back to the middle-east, to the home of some uncle, who will abuse them in the pretext of 'teaching' them how to properly act like a Muslim women. Sure, in a western country they can ran away and seek support from goverment institutions. But then how will they see their kids? While living a life of poverty in some shelter, not having a home, not having money, how can they afford to go to court to fight for their kids? And before they even get the chance to do that, their family already sent the kids by plane to the middle-east. She loses her entire life and family to fight for the right to not hide her face? No. She 'chooses' to hide her face.",,/r/europe/comments/93ne8z/danish_burqa_ban_comes_into_effect_amid_protests/e3glu0f/,carpinttas,1533194095
