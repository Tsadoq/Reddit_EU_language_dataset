I don't think people realize but our democratical system does not leave room for selective law enforcement. If you break the law and you are caught you go to jail, no matter how rich you are or how powerful of a political position you hold.

And I understand that some people may want self-determination, Spain is far from being perfect. But I can't have sympathies towards a clearly supremacist and xenophobic movement. You has been attacking regions like Andalucia or Extremadura for years, blaming them for your own problems. Regions that have contributed to build what is now Catalonia. I find it miserable.

Manipulating and lying in such a crappy and ill-intentioned way to get international support. I find it despicable.

Ignoring the other half of Catalans who do not want independence. Acting as if they did not exist, or saying things like ""we are the real Catalans"", or ""we are citizens, they are subjects"". It's disgusting.

Tryng to take advantage of the economic crisis to push the movement knowing that perhaps if the economy recovers the desire to become independent would also fall. I find it downright discouraging.

Breaking all possible laws and putting social peace and the economy at risk. I find it extremely dangerous.

And doing it without a clear plan, with zero international support. with no control of the economy, the police,  the army. etc. I have not words.  I find it incredibly stupid and difficult to understand.

By arrogance or unconsciousness You have opened a wound that will be very difficult to cure. A wound that may last for decades, and that will require a lot of effort by all the Catalans and Spaniards. I hope we are both up to the task.

I've heard about something like this but don't know too much about it, are you talking about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gareja_monastery_complex ? Seems like the Caucasian Albanian remark was a troll response to Georgia. 

&gt;Well, they don't adore Georgians but I don't think Georgia is such an issue for them. Mostly because we don't have a Georgian minority so the average Armenian barely ever interacts with Georgians.

Well it's the same for us, it's just on the basis of like Javakheti and Kvemo Kartli for both of us I would assume. Georgians just have more issues with Armenians and Turks though, probably Turks the most, but I'd probably agree with what you said before. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_(historical_region)

&gt;I don't suppose Azeri nationalists care much for Georgians?

Actually they do, most Azeris tend to like Georgians. But Azeri nationalists (to put it nicely) don't really care about the opinions of Georgians, they want a region called Borchali (in Azeri) or Kvemo Kartli in Georgian where there is a big Azeri population in Georgia, they want to unite it with Azerbaijan. It is similar with Armenian nationalists and Georgia wanting Javakheti, only difference I think is that the Azeris in Borchali don't really care about separating from Georgia. Not sure about Armenians in Javakheti though, I got the impression that they do want to separate.

It doesn't work in practice because most right wing politicians vastly underestimate where the peak of the Laffer curve lies. 

There is, however, nothing wrong with the idea of cutting taxes to stimulate the economy if you actually then expect to receive less tax revenue. That all depends on whether you agree with the current level/structure of taxation and how government resources are being spent.

&gt;Lol, they didn't have to ""survive"" anything. They were almost all exiled, as a result of the war they started. Civilian killing is a part of Turkic culture.

Are you braindead? This is a war your people started for ""muh independence, muh self determination."" You people slaughtered Azeris, and exiled hundreds of thousands of Azeris across the Arax river into Iran for their survival. You are a savage for excusing this sort of behavior.

You're unhappy with the reality of the situation, you're unhappy with the fact that being catholic is itself being a traitor. Well unfortunately that was the political reality of the day. Accept it or don't, it doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with the Irish and everything to do with catholicism, ireland just happened to be a hotbed of catholicism. 

It does not matter how boring you think traitors are, they were traitors to the power of the land. That was reason enough for them to be removed from power.

Historically, if I am not correct, please anyone correct me, Silesian ""language"" is something that is in middle of western slavic transition between what became ""Czech"" and what became ""Polish"". That mean that there was some western-slavic speaking continuum and one point started centralizing into ""Polish"", the other into ""Czech"" and Silesian was kind of caught in between. Additionally, strong migration of german colonist added a big amount of german words into it. This compounded with a harsher polish nationalization, where culture and language was much more enforced than in Czech area (Bohemia was always a bit more multicultural than Poland) give rise to Silesian as ""variant of polish with some german and some czech words"".",,/r/europe/comments/79md9r/moravian_dialects/dp4bbd2/,Unicorn_Colombo,1509408823

365,"Here in Germany a left wing coalition made the so called Hartz reforms. That were the most neo liberal reforms this country has ever seen. Social benefits were cut on many levels, a lot of privatization and deregulations were the results. Many people may not like the results, but all agreed at that time that reforms were needed and they worked out.

What I want to say with that example is that politics are less driven by ideology than in the US. That's also not quite right it's differently driven by ideology. That the US took over the loan word Realpolitik recently just shows how unflexible the US politics have become.

The focus in general is more to solve a problem than to solve it with your agenda. Agenda also plays a role, but sometimes it's the bitter pill that heals you. 

At least the German history is full of people that sat in front of a problem and used an opposing strategy to their ideology to solve the problem. From Bismarck who used the social security laws(or whatever they're called in English) to appease the left wing, over Willy Brand who started to talk to eastern Germany and the eastern bloc in general, over Gerhard Schröder(Center left wing) who has send the German military twice on a mission outside of Germany since WW2(a highly unpopular thing among the left wing) and made the reforms named above, to Merkel(center right) who took care of the refugees in a not so right wing way, but it solved the most pressing issues at that time. 

The problem in the article seems more like a failure in the system(maybe a wanted one), but it's not like universal healthcare in Denmark is under attack. A right wing party here would propose something like universal health care only for natives, but a general attack on universal health care would be polical suicide.

This is not true. Buses stop running at 1:00am. I've taken late-night buses from the university area to the city center dozens of times. They do become somewhat infrequent, though. (one bus every 45 to 60 minutes)

&gt;shops have very short working hours (according to locals - this decision was heavily influenced by Chruch)

Yeah, that one I can confirm, unfortunately. During the week, most shops (supermarkets, etc.) are open from 8am to 8pm. That's fine. But try to shop on a Sunday or a holiday and you'll find that it's next to impossible for anything other than basic necessities (food and medicine).

&gt;I experienced that myself as well as witnessed my Indian/Nepali/Nigerian friends having some unpleasantness.

Also somewhat true. Most people are friendly, but there is a sizeable amount of xenophobic assholes. Your experience doesn't surprise me, unfortunately. The state's politics also reflect this, with the FPÖ having the biggest voterbase in the country (percentage-wise).

Israel exists because of the Holocaust. I don't think it's remotely comparable. Aside from the Assyrians who were also being killed at the same time, I've never read about another people being entirely exterminated from almost all of their native lands.

All other minority languages and dialects like Arvanite, Vlach and I don't know what else, were and are still normally practised.

Secondly, the part where Greece changed the names is true, but what they did is called RE-HELLENIZATION and not HELLENIZATION. Most of the names are ancient Hellenic names that when the Bulgarians Turks or whoever came put their name. So indeed, Greece put the right names again. But that doesn't mean anything, my village for example has 2 names on Greek and one Turkish many people use both, mountains rivers or anything maybe have like 3-4 names (ancient Greek, Byzantine Greek, Bulgarian, Vlach, Turkish etc). People use whatever.

The thing with the names again is again half truth. Keep in mind that by 1950 most non Greeks, mainly Turks and Bulgarians had left Greece. It's true that there were conversions. Just like this happened everywhere, turkey or Bulgaria for example. Also, there were many Greeks who only spoke Bulgarian/Greek due to pressure from the local community.

Every identity is free and was free to express in Greece. Never festivals were band whatever language they were. The thing is what you will sing on those festivals and what you will promote. The thing that many don't like is that the Greek government never promotes non-hellenic things.

450,"First, why do you keep refusing to reply to the question? Is the UN right about the schooling in home-language being an universal children's right or not?

Second, why did you pick up a 2 pages pamphlet from 2005 (12 years ago!!!), which isn't even the ""foundational manifest of the Ciudadanos"", as you claim - rather the party would be founded more than a year later!- instead of their actual platform? I mean who the heck, when trying to make a point about a  political party platform, looks, not at that party platform, but at a bunch of lines written well before the party even existed? You probably thought you could get away with it, didn't you? Oops.

And why did you do it? Well, for starters:
&gt;And then it says that the catalan students are amongst the worst in the world in oral and written comprehension, that OF COURSE is a lie.

First, it doesn't say that ""catalan students are amongst the worst in the world "", rather that they're among the worst in the ""developed world""- you can probably find some comments of mine in Spanish/Catalan, so there's really no point in trying to push misleading translations.

You stridently claim that it ""OF COURSE is a lie"". Too bad for you that we have plenty of PISA tests from before that text was written. For examples, [here's](https://i.gyazo.com/e5693a0ec9c9d0ea65b2d9c76e79175d.png) from the paper [The Quality of Catalan and Spanish Education Systems: A Perspective from Pisa](http://www.iese.edu/research/pdfs/DI-0810-E.pdf), Ciccone et al, 2009. 

""Poorly in this group""? ""3rd or 4th from the bottom""? And that includes other Spanish regions. 

And here's from a paper on PISA 2003 (hence before that manifest you linked was written), [El Estudio Pisa 2003 en Cataluña: Resultados y factores contextuales](http://www.mecd.gob.es/dctm/revista-de-educacion/articulosre2006/re200624.pdf?documentId=0901e72b812045a4, Joaquím Prats, Universidad de Barcelona):
&gt;En comprensión lectora la puntuación media ha sido de 483 puntos, situándose en el nivel 3. La puntuación del alumnado de Cataluña ha resultado inferior a la media de la OCDE y casi igual a la del conjunto de la muestra española.

Once again, oops.

Anyway, that's a pretty lateral point that I should probably have ignored. 

Finally, I have no idea what you meant with this:
&gt;It says that in the catalan educational system spanish is too little importance and that the system denies that some catalans have it as a mother tongue, that is a lie that anyone that had scolarhsip in catalonia would easily spot.

What that paragraph states is that successive nationalist governments haves systemically minimized the importance of Spanish, denying its role as the mother-tongue of most Catalans. How is this even impeachable?

I mean, public schools in Cataluña do NOT offer classes. There are hundreds and hundreds of cases of parents having to sue schools and school districts and the regional government. The Catalan Surpeme Court has ruled over and over against the government. What's exactly the point you're trying to make?

Most kids in Cataluña are denied their right to be taught in their mother-tongue - which also happens to be the primary language of their own contry. It's a shameful, bizarre situation. No wonder you have to resort to so many deflections and lies in an attempt to deny it.

**All this said, you still haven't been able to explain what the heck would the Cs do to Catalan language and culture that leaves you so horrified you couldn't even put it into words.**

Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.",,/r/europe/comments/79mwj5/map_of_the_armenian_genocide_and_the_deportation/dp3yji4/,HakobG,1509394282

(Also note that unlike Christians and Jews, in those extreme interpretations Yezidis do not enjoy even third-class citizen status because they are not a ""People of the Book"".)

&gt; Double standard

Well it is whataboutism in all its glory as a rhetoric to form the public opinion. As I said in another comment, the double standard rhetoric is used for everything in Turkey. Nothing is free from it. The Armenian genocide is of course no exception. Of course on its own, free of politics, it is not an invalid point, but this thing has been brought on by the establishment not because of a need by the public. It is just more denial rhetoric, just like the other many rhetorics in regards to everything to do with Turkish politics vis-a-vis foreign affairs. The rhetoric of the victimisation of Muslims and Turks and the Sevres Syndrome. This is the problem which needs a solution and this is what reasonable Turks should go after, democracy and freedoms. Only a truly democratic Turkey will be able to recognise the Armenian genocide.

&gt; They will only recognize when they run out of excuses,

Which they never will and you should know how this works. I mean the long time freaking mayor of the capital of Turkey is a conspiracy theory nut job. This is the root problem. Turks shouldn't look outside Turkey for their problems and enemies. They should look inside Turkey.

Of course inside Russia different people have different opinions, so I don’t really get your broad generalizations about “Russia” let alone about “Eastern and Western Europe”.

Either out of well intentioned ignorance or out of a propaganda overdose you’re refusing to call Stalin for what he was. Stalin isn’t “seen as the incarnation of pure evil” out of spite or moral superiority towards Russians, but because he objectively was a mass murderer. Who mainly targeted Russians.

727,"&gt; El secretario de Estado belga de Migración y Asilo, Theo Francken, del partido independentista flamenco N-VA, sugirió en su cuenta de Twitter que Puigdemont puede solicitar ""asilo político"" en Bélgica, aunque, el primer ministro belga, Charles Michel, se desmarcó poco después de la propuesta: ""Pido a Theo Francken que no eche leña al fuego"".

&gt; No obstante, el comisario general belga para los refugiados y los apátridas, Dirk Van den Bulcke, dijo este lunes que para que Bélgica conceda asilo a otro ciudadano europeo, como podría ser el caso de Puigdemont, deben existir ""señales serias de persecución"" o de que corre riesgos en el país de origen. ""Debe haber señales serias de persecución pero, incluso en el caso de la persecución, (debe haber) una imposibilidad de obtener protección en el país"", dijo Van den Bulcke en declaraciones recogidas por la cadena de televisión RTL.

&gt; Asimismo, el primer ministro belga, Charles Michel, se desmarcó este domingo de las declaraciones de Francken y aseguró que el asilo para el presidente catalán cesado ""no está en absoluto en el orden del día de su Gobierno"". Van den Bulcke señaló que es ""normal"" que exista la presunción de que no hay posibilidad de que un ciudadano europeo obtenga asilo en otro Estado miembro, ""salvo, en teoría, en situaciones muy excepcionales, muy especiales"".

Everything you wrote didn't answer my question. I'll repeat: 

&gt; What has the Balkans and Circassians have to do with **Turkish denial of its own past** but whataboutism which is not even related to Armenians?

Now you are going to say that all atrocities ever committed against Muslims, Turkic peoples, or any other group the Turkish establishment draws an association with have to be acknowledged first and for its before the clear case of the Armenian genocide is stopped being institutionally denied, let alone acknowledged? Mother of all what aboutisms?

What you don't realize is that this is just tactics concocted by the Turkish establishment to rally Turks behind its centennial systematic denial campaign. If these were inexistent or solved, other stuff would pop up. 

The Armenians have been struggling for their case for a hundred years and suddenly now it is politically convenient to remember the Balkans and Circassians. The fact that none of this has been brought up by Turkey in the last hundred years is evidence that it is political expediency.

No it doesn't.   
Its representation is NOT based on what language they speak. The French speaking people outside Wallonia and Brussels are NOT represented.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Community_of_Belgium
The French Community of Belgium includes 4.5 million people, of whom:    
3.6 million live in the Walloon Region (that is almost the entirety of the inhabitants of this region, apart from people who live in the German-speaking communes, who number around 70,000);    
900,000[4] living in the Brussels-Capital Region (out of 1.1 million inhabitants).     
French speakers who live in the Flemish Region are not included in the official numbers for the French-speaking Community, since the French Community has no jurisdiction in that region.     

See! That's eaxcvtly the reason why I called it Wallonia. Even you don't know the exact details of what who and where.

&gt;**Puigdemont and five 'exconsellers' plan to seek political asylum in Belgium**
&gt;
&gt;The retired president of the Generalitat has traveled to the community city to maintain political contacts
&gt;
&gt;Carles Puigdemont is in Brussels on Monday. As La Sexta has advanced and the newspaper has confirmed, Puigdemont and five other members of the Government ceased intend to apply for political asylum in Belgium.
&gt;
&gt;The ex-deputy of the Generalitat in Brussels, Amadeu Altafaj, has organized the displacement of Puigdemont despite having complied with his resignation, according to the letter he published Monday.
&gt;
&gt;Interior Ministry sources have said that they are not ""worried"" about this trip of Puigdemont, because what they were interested in ""more today"" is that it was not to Palau de la Generalitat, reports Pilar Santos.
&gt;
&gt;The general coordinator of the PP, Fernando Martínez-Maillo, has considered that the visit of the 'president' ceased to Brussels is ""a sample of the most absolute despair"". ""Going to Brussels, home to the European institutions, where one of the great values ​​is the defense of the rule of law, of legality, of constitutional values, is a contradiction in itself, so that it stays at home. It's a blunder, ""Maillo said in a statement to the media after the meeting of the popular executives.
&gt;
&gt;""Puigdemont has freedom of movement to go to Brussels ... and back,"" added the conservative leader.
&gt;
&gt;Asylum offer
&gt;
&gt;The trip occurs in parallel to the filing of a complaint this morning by sedition and rebellion by the prosecution against him and the Govern and the table of the Parlament.
&gt;
&gt;It also comes a day after the Belgian government's immigration secretary was open to offering ""asylum"" to Puigdemont, an end that was denied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.

Secretary of State Theo Francken of the Flemish independence party N-VA said yesterday morning via Twitter that the dismissed president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Carles Puigdemont, has the option of applying for ""political asylum"" in Belgium. ""The Catalan president Puigdemont can apply for political asylum"" in Belgium, said Francken through his account in the social network.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/79ni70/catalan_expresident_puigdemont_is_in_brussels/dp3e2zi/,vokegaf,1509372484

Bar Norway (it's always bar Norway) and some micronations, the two richest guys are Netherlands and Switzerland

Well, 

Both are small blobs that got independent from some European big guy

Both are very dense

Both are tax heavens

What I noticed now is that both are the antithesis geographically. One is Mr I'm flat meme and the other Mr I'm a mountain meme

Netherlands is the most socially progressive kind for a developed country. Switzerland is the most conservative for developed countries standard.


If you study the wealthiest zones of europe, you'll notice that two circles stands out as the most developed in europe. 
   
    +the first is the north sea circle. The wealthiest part of England is London which is part of it, the wealthiest part of Scotland is part of it. Belgium is divided in what's part of this circle, which is the wealthy part, and a part which is wealthy but considerably less and is the zone not affected by it. One of the richest zones of Germany is the part that touches the north sea like hamburg which is one of the richest cities in Germany. Some of the richest countries are the ones part of that circle like Denmark and Norway. What's the epitome of that circle, ie ""central"":**Netherlands **

    +the other wealthy circle is the alpine circle. Ignoring ill(ille?) de France which is basically Paris, the richest regions of France are the ones that touch or are close to the alps. The wealthiest regions in Italy are the ones that are closer to the alps. The wealthiest part of Germany are close to the alps (together with the north sea circle parts) . Austria is a very wealthy country of that circle jerk, all the alpine region is wealthy. Is there any chance that there is exactly one independent blob of land more or less at the center of that? Actually there is. Seriously?? Who? Answer :**Switzerland **. Ta-dandam(Beethoven background)

Why is the Netherlands insisting that Finland is their enemy?

That's not what the graph is about. It is about wheter they think it can be justified.

Besides that the reason Sweden is ""The Rape Capital of Europe"" is because they have a very liberal definition on what constitutes rape.  You can't really compare these rates across countries, also because the likelihood of someone reporting it varies very widely. Do you seriously think that Egypt has a rape rate of 0,1, Ukraine has one of 1,4, Hungary has one of 2,8, yet Sweden has one of  60+ (which btw they had already in 2010, so this isn't because of the refugees)? These very low numbers in many eastern European and Arabic countries actually mean that nobody bloody damn cares if women are raped and that you're scoffed at if you go to the police with it. The very high rate in Scandinavia indicates a more liberal and open approach to sexual violence.

Meanwhile Puigdemont shows no intention to rectify and instead wants to pretend like he's leading a government from exile. So why exactly should an amnesty be offered to him? He is continuing to ignore the Spanish law and defying the legal authorities in Spain.

If anyone could get an amnesty/lighter punishment, it's the one minister in Puigdemont's government who didn't agree with DUI and resigned before it happened. But Puigdemont?

888,"I actually think you make great points, but let's not open that door since the army conversations I have tried to have on r/Suomi tend to be shitshows. Army and conscription seem to be kind of sacred things on Finland. 


However in this particular case you judged Soini's meaning wrong. He isn't careless of Finnish lives, in fact he is doing the exact opposite since he is taking care of our diplomatic relations so there would never be any war in what to participate in (this is overly simplifying but I think you get what I mean).


&gt;Not to mention women are also not conscripted, which makes it not only slavery, but sexism as well.


This is spot on, there _doesn't_ exist any kind of reason for why we girls don't have to go. None. It comes purely out of the view that women are precious diamonds that should be protected till the end (also probably that girls aren't as competent than men). Actually even in our wars when things started to get desperate women weren't let to grab arms. 


The weirdest thing is that young boys/men who are super progressive and respect women and treat them as equals (and I can easily make the generalization that the overwhelming majority of Finnish men are like this) silently accept this. Irl the majority of my friends went to army a couple of years ago (some still have it waiting), and most of them didn't complain about it. I know alot of those who did the civilian service too, and those who criticize the army in general but people are strangely accepting about the blatant inequality it poses. Recently there has been going on some discussion about it in public though.


The crazies thing is that I've been confessed that they feel like they have to go to the army to be viewed as ""men"", which is the craziest thing if you knew how these people are. I'm talking left leaning, progressive well educated city boys who still are under this kind of pressure. Sure I could imagine it's nothing like what it used to be like 30 years ago or so, but still. It's nuts.


Finland and Finnish culture is so fucking weird sometimes, seriously. I know the word triggers some people, but our mandatory army service thing for men only and all the pressure about masculinity and other shit is contains is the text book example of protective patriarchy, but we don't have any of the oppressive patriarchy parts in our culture. Otherwise women are treated exactly like men. So it doesn't make any sense.

Let's break this into two sentences:

&gt; Not the percentage of EU countries that don't think 

Assuming that the first *not* in here means the opposite of, we can clear the first and the second negatives, making this:

**The percentage of EU countries that think**

Otherwise, this may simply be a map showing any other random statistic that isn't the percentage of EU countries that don't think that survey maps not without multiple negatives aren't kinda dumb.

Now, moving on to the second part:

&gt; that survey maps not without multiple negatives aren't kinda dumb

We can split this part into smaller parts using antonyms, giving us even easier sentences to analyse.

&gt; that survey maps not without 

So *not without* is *with*

**that survey maps with**

&gt; multiple negatives aren't kinda dumb

We could convert *dumb* to *clever*

**multiple negatives are kinda clever**

Which makes the second complete part become:

**that survey maps with multiple negatives are kinda smart**

964,"&gt;Who'd help those people if not us?

Who's help poor children in Europe if not for us? I don't understand why those types of arguments only ever seem to be used for people outside of Europe. You constantly hear things like ""We have a responsibility to help.."" in various cases around the globe, but no one ever seems to say that about the poor children (or people in general) right here in Europe. If we have a responsibility to help *anyone* surely it's our own people? That's how the world general functions. A country is *supposed* to help its own people, and then if it's struggling it can ask for help from others.

&gt;I feel we have a humanitarian responsibility for the world.

Europe isn't a part of the world then? By choosing the spend money on one thing, you're actively choosing not to spend it on something else. The reason the poor children on that chart continue to be that poor is because we spend our money elsewhere.

&gt; There are so many people much worse off than poor people in Europe 

Yes, and people in North Korea have it worse than people in Ghana or whatever, and so what? How does that help people in Ghana? Are their lives suddenly any better simply because NK has it worse? No.

Someone in Europe doesn't stop being poor just because someone else is even poorer.

You've now moved the goal post to trying to discredit 3 of the available papers on glyphosate toxicity by mentioning the retraction and republication of a paper on rats which Séralini coauthored. Séralini wasn't the only author of those studies.

His ""controversial"" rat study was amended and republished to address the ""controversy"".

You're trying to discredit them because of the the coauthors had to amend and republish one of his other studies.

That's about 3 degrees of separation. You're literally grasping for straws here.

These are not the only available studies.

If you have a problem that Séralini is a consultant for a homeopathic firm, then how about the other available studies?

The list goes on. More studies are always popping up.

If we're to have a proper discussion about the safety of Roundup, all available data needs to be reviewed.

This was my point.

There is not enough info to undoubtedly say that Roundup is not a carcinogen. Even Monsanto says this.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/business/monsantos-sway-over-research-is-seen-in-disclosed-emails.html

&gt; In a 2003 email, a different Monsanto executive tells others, “You cannot say that Roundup is not a carcinogen … we have not done the necessary testing on the formulation to make that statement. The testing on the formulations are not anywhere near the level of the active ingredient. We can make that statement about glyphosate and can infer that there is no reason to believe that Roundup would cause cancer.”

And the studies that Monsanto uses to ""prove"" that glyphosate is not a carcinogen are Monsanto funded and made by long time Monsanto employed scientists.

We need independent studies. That's the point.

That means studies that are not payed by Monsanto or by the anti Monsanto industry because both can be attacked as being biased.

We can fight a futile dick measuring contest about who has the most studies to prove his point, but that's a pointless battle as long as those studies aren't independent. And very few are because you can always argue that homeopathy isn't realy science and a homeopathic firm funded a study which concluded that glyphosate is harmful. Although saying that is a pretty huge stretch of the immagination, I agree that we need independent studies funded by the authorities which aim to investigate the safety of glyphosate and carried out by independent laboratories. This never happens and that leads to conclusiveness and biased decisions.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/78ut32/eu_lawmakers_vote_to_ban_glyphosate_weed_killer/dp3698t/,adevland,1509358242

Spain = liberal democracy with a modern constitution well respected by all members of national government. All laws created in  the country are tested on this constitution and international treaties.

Russia = a oligarchy where the will of the people barely comes trough to parliament. Putin is a autocratic leader and implements his policies without much regard to the  constitution and international treaties.

Do you starr to understand it? When you dont follow the system of laws, checks and balances in Spain, you openly piss on democratic vallues and disrespect a democratic constitution. People like you often complain about the election of Trump and how he cant do as he wish even though he s the President. He has to keep himself to the checks and balances of the US democratic proces. If Trump would organize illegal political actions specifically forbidden by US courts on the principles of the US consitition, then you folks would go completely nuts.

You people seem to not care about laws, checks and balances when they hinder your views, yet when someone else suggests to ignore them you happily call them a democracy disregarding fascist. Its sickening.

Otherwise, ""what"" (meaning ""what thing"", i.e. not referring to any particular noun) is *que* at the beginning of a sentence (e.g. *Que veux-tu dire ?*), and *quoi* when standing alone (as it would be in this map) or in any other position (e.g. *Tu veux quoi ?*).

Additionally, any question in French must be marked with one of three levels of formality: subject-object inversion, with any interrogative placed at the beginning (high); insertion of *est-ce que* at the beginning of the sentence but after any interrogative word (medium); or merely rising intonation, with any interrogative now optionally placed at the beginning (low).

*Est-ce que* alters to *est-ce qui* in the presence of an interrogative referring to the subject of a sentence.  When this is a ""what"", you have to use this (e.g. *Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?*) rather than one of the other two ways of forming questions.  Oh, and *que* elides to *qu'* before any vowel.

If you want to ask a *direct question* (note: to which the answer **is not yes/no**) in Spanish, you will always start that question with an interrogative pronoun (qué, quién, cuál...). You can also start with a preposition (Con qué, a dónde, hasta cuándo.... ).

Yes/no questions... you'll always need to start with ¿. But these are the easiest to formulate. 

I believe there are three ways to ask questions in Spanish:

**Direct questions** (they go in between ¿?)

1) Yes/No answer:

Take the statement and put it between ¿?. E.g. Te gusta el café -&gt; ¿Te gusta el café? Sí/No.

2) Partial answer:

The type described above. E.g. ¿Qué vas a tomar? Voy a tomar un café. ¿Con qué vas a tomar el café? Con azúcar.

1123,"&gt; First, that runs a very dangerous risk of trying to tamp down on True Things You Don't Want To Have Said rather than material put out to harm you.

It's Russian propaganda things that I don't want said. Whether they're true or not, whether they're good or bad. Russian media is not an information source.       

There are more than 500 million people living in Europe, if we can't get our dose of self-criticism from there then we are lost either way. Plus all international media is welcome to criticise, though personally when I read English-sphere media I'm left with the impression they don't understand what they're talking about in regards to Europe. Even so I wouldn't presume to ban them. But whomever has connections to the Kremlin should get the boot.     


&gt;Second, I think that reputation also is a mechanism for dealing with credibility in media. I am not convinced that that doesn't work.

Vaatimusta perusteltiin sotilaallisilla syillä. Sotatilanteessa ei katsottu voitavan täysin luottaa niihin raja-alueen asukkaisiin, jotka puhuvat naapurimaan kieltä. Aikakauden rotuteorioiden perusteella länsipohjalaisten ja saamelaisten katsottiin myös kuuluvan alempaan ei-germaaniseen rotuun. Tämä asenne loi suomen tai meänkielen käytölle voimakkaan kielteisen leiman. Alueen kouluissa alettiin käyttää opetuskielenä ainoastaan ruotsia ja lapsia kiellettiin rangaistuksen uhalla puhumasta suomea. Kielto koski jopa välitunteja.

This is not so true as you and me think. Local minorities also pay taxes and has the same right as local majorities. But only South Tyrol really accepts the situation. But this is quite rare exception. 

&gt; I wonder why Ukraine did not go that way instead - by strengthening Ukrainian education and proficiency requirements across the board.

I also wonder, only guesses:
* Ukraine is poor country
* Attempt to fully replace Russian with Ukrainian(this is correct move, by the way) due to war.
* If you remove Russian it is difficult to save Hungarian. Possible, but difficult. 

Still primary education are available for minorities. With secondary I am not sure. As far as I know, this is common practice for Europe with few notable exception.

1305,"In my opinion the most important things that could justify an independent movement(in a peacefull setting like the UK or Spain) are history as an independent entity and the lack of cultural similarities between this entity and the rest of the union they belong to. I think current support for independence is obviously needed, but not really telling when trying to justify the movement, as it fluctuates by things that have nothing to do with actual independence or self-determination, things like the economic situation or the political climate that can be used to manipulate people. I think breaking a country with centuries of common history because some douche is currently in power or because we are enduring hardship from an economic crisis would be a terrible mistake. But nothing will stop people trying to take advantage of these kind of situations.

The line between the basque people and the rest of Spain has been blurred with centuries of common history but it's still there, they are their own thing and I couldn't be more happy for sharing my country and culture with them, but if they want to be by their own thing i would respect that. I see Scotland in the same light. The support for independence is low in Basque country because they know they benefit from our union, but there has always been and probably always be a lattent nationalist sentiment.

Catalonia has never been an independent kingdom, Catalonia was an important part of the Kingdom of Aragon but Aragon was much more. We are no special snowflake even when out leaders for the last decades have tried hard to convince us of it, Catalans are as different from a ""Castillian"" as anyone from aragon, Valencia, Asturias, Balearic islands or any other region of Spain, we are a very diverse country with tons of cultures mashed together, but the independence movement in Catalonia is fairly new and in my opinion is mostly based on greed and the hunger for power of some politicians.

I think you can see this reflected on Spain's constitutional referendum of 1978 after Francos dictatorship ended, the support for the constitution was huge in Catalonia(more than 90%), more than madrid's, because they were getting a sweet deal, tons of autonomy. The basque people were offered an even better deal (their historical rights are preserved in our constitution), but they voted way less in favor of the constitution (~60% in favour i dont exactly remember), thats because their nationalist sentiment can't be bought. In Catalonia the nationalist sentiment was fringe, and our leaders have worked very hard to grow it, lying, blaming. just 10 years ago it was less than 15%. 

This movement was created, but Scotland's or the Basque ones were always there and always will be. 

I just hope we can keep using more the logic and less the sentiments, and keep nationalism of all kinds reduced to the minimum.

You are turning on each other like a bunch of animals, but I believe in the end the liberal/pro-unity side will win, but there will be much pain. Europe is always reacting to events, not determining them. There is no proactive European policy, just responding to events and chaos.

For example, you are from the Netherlands I assume, a country that had many of its citizens literally blown out of the sky because of direct Russian action, and the Netherlands decided to hold up Ukraine's association agreement with the EU, when the opposite should have been the case. 

You have all been so complacent and passive for so long that strongmen (like Putin), know they can walk all over you, even kill your citizens, and still you will trade with them, meet with them, etc. You are nothing in their eyes, have no bite, no nothing. They can literally steal territory the size of the Netherlands (Crimea) from another European nation(Ukraine) before your very eyes, and still you will talk and talk and talk and talk, and by the time you are done talking the territory has been solidified and the passing of time will make de-facto Russian control into real Russian control.

1352,"As beautiful as the details of the Milan Cathedral are, the proportions of it and its facade are just jarring. Instead of going tall like most Gothic cathedrals (in order to allow for much bigger windows and therefore have a much brighter interior), it instead went wide, with unpleasant results. The facade became a large triangle that is an inexplicable mixture of Roman and Gothic architecture. The nave became barely taller than the double aisles, which meant the windows had to be much smaller (which therefore meant that the nave became rather dark. Had the nave been at least twice as high as the inner aisle, the proportions of the cathedral would have been more aesthetically pleasing and the nave would have been so much brighter.

Also, while the exterior of the cathedral is richly decorated with intricate Late Gothic tracery, the interior stands in stark contrast with its plain, unadorned walls (with the notable exception of the aisle vaults), atypical for a Late Gothic style cathedral (usually covered in intricate tracery). 

As a whole, the Milan Cathedral's appearance is saved only by the intricate blind tracery covering its exterior walls, beautiful window tracery (most notably the large windows in the apse), as well as its tall, magnificently carved spires that dot its roof with pleasing regularity. Had the facade been uniformly Gothic and its nave built much taller with correspondingly bigger windows, the Milan Cathedral would have been the embodiment of perfection.",,/r/europe/comments/79hr0i/top_of_il_duomo_milano/dp2xtos/,Atharaphelun,1509338234

1359,"In the early '90 (more precisely 91 for Moldova),  both countries started on almost equal foot. It was actually worse for Romania since we had whole industries that  had to be shut down while RM didn't have much to begin with. So I'm asking here, what kind of economic ties did they expect when both had to go from the ground up? But even then, that is not what Moldova expected, because even today, they expect some kind of handouts. They also leaned towards Russia most of the time, so why didn't they built economic ties with Russia, to get better? Anyway, RM needs to understand that they are the one that need  to do the efforts.

As for 4th kid (pro-eu and against a union with Romania), those are the delusional type. The road to EU goes through Romania, either they like it or not. Without help from Romania, RM is lost on the way to EU, being neutral (which they are not) is just a dream that won't come true. 

I'm  harsh but that's the reality, I've seen what kind of mentality drives RM, and it's like people live in some alternate universe. Even their perception of Romania is so skewed it's sad, for them.

1361,"It's beneficial and a curse at the same time is how I should put it?  In America, at least. It does some good and equally has some bad attached to it.  Thus, it goes back to the cycle that I mentioned before. So, I can't easily say that the good outweighs the bad and vice versa.  

Property rents and taxes are going up across the globe.  :/. Unfortunately, not sure if that would ever be reversed at all.  It kicks out long time (law abiding) residents in favor of people, willing to pay more just for the ridiculous inflation. Something doesn't seem right every time I hear this kind of story in the US.   However, that does remind me of the recent news of London's toll fee going up?  D: You have my condolences. (I live in the NYC region, so I can relate.) 

But, I think that's good that most of your homeless are staying with their friends. They got a safe place to stay at with people they can trust.  Over here, if it's not the outdoor homeless, who prefer to be left alone, the rest of them all try to find shelters. Sometimes, the shelters can over crowd so they'll have to find another place. In NYC though, the mayor is making some hotels become homeless hotels to house the homeless.  :/ Local residents aren't happy.  It's why the delicate balance of decision making is hard for the government to resolve. 

The dems and repubs are pretty much on their own cycle. There's a lot of pork that they can bilaterally agree on to remove, but, because of all the drama between both sides, sometimes attaining bipartisanship can be hard. It only sounds easy. Executing it where both sides are happy is like a miracle to me. 😥

As for your last bit, yeah. Everywhere. The whole world. It's a slow progress indeed, but we can't rush things either.  I do hope though that parts of Africa can get a little more education on health. The recent black death virus in Madagascar really shows we still got a long way in the 21st century.

Because there have never been unjust laws. Calalonia should be happy with their forced union, or else. Why should there be a limit on the amount of freedoms a group of people should have. Why limit them if it has to benefits. Currently Calalonia is very economically rich and therefore it has to pay a lot of taxes which go towards poorer areas of Spain that aren't successful. Why should the catalonians have to bankroll the rest of the country when they are a separate people who have every right under international law to see that money go into their own communities, their own people, their own culture. But that doesn't even matter. I don't really care is Catalonia go independent or choose to remain part of spain. The point is that they should have the **right** to choose and if the Government denies them that right then they should be able to use civil disobedience as a means to realise those rights.

Is this for children who somehow find themselves in the situation where they have to support themselves under the age of 18? If so I find this very questionable - how are you accounting for government assistance, how large are your samples, etc.

If you are referring to children who don't have to support themselves and have prents that work, but the graphic just measures the income of the 17 year old, then thsi graphic is pointless. Name a high paying job a 17 year old can consistently find in any country. They have no high level skills yet, of course they will be below average. When I was 17 I worked part time in a sandwich shop - but that was just to help pay for a used car. I wasn't starving and begging for food at all.

So in the event that this graphic measures the income of families with children, then there is something to be said, but again I wonder how government assistance is being accounted for.

People have the right to choose and they don't have to be oppressed by a fascist strawman to be able to do so. If a region and a people group wish to leave a democracy where they have equal rights then that is self determination. 

Some times humanrights have been obstructed by laws but these days we look back at those act of civil-disobedience as steps towards greater freedoms and the realisation of those human rights and guiding principles of humanity which make the world a nicer place to live in. I know that there will be people who would rather oppressive laws keep everyone in line and that full automancy must be oppressed at all cost but I personally hope that historical exampes can help us see that the restriction of liberties only leads to misery in the long run.

1516,"Try googling what the PKK and the YPG have in mind when it comes to a Kurdish state. I’m not against Kurds having a country of their own, but they are (at least some organizations) are fighting a war they cannot win to grab land from Southeastern Turkey. This has caused thousands of deaths on both sides in the last 20-25 years.  What began as a movement to end suffering (which was caused by the Turkish government) for the Kurdish populace turned into a power struggle for this part of our country. And sadly, the innocent Kurdish civilians have had the worst of this fighting. There are a lot of incidents which prove that PKK doesn’t care about any civilian Turkish or Kurdish) casualities when it comes to reaching their goal. And the thing is, they can keep this guarilla warfare up for quite some time but the Turkish army will never withdraw from the Southeast. It is against our constitution and our culture to give up any piece of land, no matter what happens. In my opinion, the lives of Kurdish citizens who stay out of politics and just move om with their everyday lives has improved significantly over the last decade. I acknowledge the fact that some Kurds are still treated like second class citizens, but this constant fighting with the PKK definetly isnt helping us improve this situation. When PKK does something bad, some people blame the entirety of Kurds, further alienating them from the society. 

I personally believe that these lands have seen enough war. It is time to make peace, but neither side wants to back down. This is why the state of my country troubles me.

1596,"&gt; I'll start with the central government first

You seem to be saying that, other than the king, the only responsibility the central government has on this is ""allowing devolution in the first place"". Many other things come to mind. 

The central government has also used hate to further their electoral goals, as they are doing right now, specially because, as a party, they have absolutely 0 hopes of winning in Catalonia itself, so they just don't care about irritating Catalans. It's exactly the same reason that the regionalist parties don't care about rritating Spaniards. Except that national parties hold much more power, so it's a pretty unbalanced situation: their hate can do much more widespread damage. 

In addition, it's still not clear to me why they had to do the demonstration of force. It makes absolutely no sense . Let them vote, dammit, and then just contest the result by saying that the unionists did not vote. Which is basically what they did on the previous one and what they ended up doing on this one anyway. The police show did nothing other than handling evidence to a lot of people that the central government is indeed authoritarian and trigger-happy, as secessionists had been arguing. 

&gt; This has had the unfortunate side effect of polarizing Spanish society and driving up both Spanish nationalism and Catalonian regionalism

This is something that escapes my understanding. I still don't understand why people from outside Catalonia ""polarize"" if Catalonia asks for more autonomy. The only way I can explain this is because people assume that if Catalonia gets more autonomy it would be ""stealing from them"", which is highly ironic.

But it is indeed one of the messages that PP has been trying to sell, e.g. during the entire statut shit-show. 

&gt; They'll make statements about fascism, the state robbing them, and being oppressed while simultaneously saying they love Spain and the EU even though their support for the EU constitution vote was among the lowest in Spain.

Here I completely disagree. You can say that you hate the current central government in Spain without saying that you hate Spain. In fact, it is also quite possible the current party could be fascist to the Catalans and not-fascist to anyone else. (As I said above, PP just doesn't get that many votes from Catalonia any more, so why care being nice to Catalans?  )

Also: using the EU constitution support as proof of support for the EU is absolutely evil. The EU constitution was almost universally bashed by the left-wing because of the free-trade related bullshit  The EU constitution support is almost a mirror of the usually right/left-wing divide in Spain.

&gt; Now it seems like the PP and PSOE want to begin a debate about constitutional reform

PSOE has had the banner of constitutional reform for a decade without anyone believing them. The last time PP and PSOE wanted to reform the constitution, they made a change that the majority of Spaniards were _against_. In fact, that change has been used multiple times _against_ Catalonia, and in fact it has been the main reason the government used legally to trigger 155 these days (violation of debt ceil by the Catalan argument).

No one believes the change will come from either PP and PSOE, and I don't, either. 

&gt; Instead the majority seem to want either a federal state within Spain, to continue their existence as a comunidad, or be recognized as a region

This has been the case since forever. A huge majority of Catalans want more autonomy. Initially, this was not independence. Secessionism just started when, for multiple reasons, the flow of devolution stopped. This might be because PSOE usually respected the devolution flow, and PP also did while their friends from PDECAT governed in Catalonia. The flow seemingly stopped when PDECAT lost Catalonia and both PP and PDECAT started spurring hate in order to get back into their respective thrones. 

But for me the important question is still the same it was a decade ago.

How are you going to organize a country where multiple regions want higher autonomy, while multiple regions want _less_ autonomy? 

If you have a asymmetric system as we have now, then the best strategy for the regions that want less autonomy is to either request more autonomy for themselves too, or, if possible, to try to reduce the autonomy the other regions have. And we end up with trouble.  This is the current situation in Spain. 

I see no easy solution to this problem. My favorite territorial organization, which would be a federation of equals, is not possible unless all the regions in Spain get to decide whether they get to form part of ""Spain"" or not.

1719,"&gt;McDonald's lunch neither ""luxury"" or ""pampering""

McDonalds is pretty expensive everywhere. You can eat for less that actually resembles food and not a lump of tasteless yuck.

Also, why would you eat at McDonalds in Paris where that crap tastes exactly the same as in every country of the world? Can't you do that at home until you can't fathom to swallow one more burger?

I say it again: You miss the point of interrail (which is the same since creation) completely.


&gt;Do tell what is the point? Go to France but not eat French food? Go to Munchen but not drink a beer? Go to Paris but only look at the Eiffel tower from the outside?

French food = McDonalds ...ok...
If you knew anything about french food you wouldn't think of glittery restaurants. Eat what regular people do. As if all ""Western"" Eurpeans eat at the Ritz in Budapest, Warsaw or Moskau.

Drinking a 0,5 l beer in Munchen costs 3 € : https://www.tz.de/muenchen/gastronomie/500-jahre-reinheitsgebot-ere654220/bierpreis-atlas-eine-uebersicht-bierpreise-muenchen-5960779.html

But that's besides the point. Interrailling has been created and was used as a way for young people to discover Europe on the cheap and by themselves.
Groups of 18-27 year olds with backpacks, tents, sleeping bag and a gas cooker living off of bread, soups, fruits from the market or supermarket, wild camping if they couldn't find a free/open youth hostel or their planned budget forbid it.
Washing their 3 pair of socks and 4 undies by hand at camping places.
Meeting others on the nighttrains and exchange stories about their adventures and maybe changing their plans to join another group to end up in an other country as they had planned to.

Others with more money and already in a job might have used it as tool to move from party hotspot to party hotspot, but that isn't what it was created for.

Just like some people do the  Camino de Santiago partway by taxi and live in 5 star hotels. That's not what the CdS is about, luxury and being driven around.

&gt;Go to Paris but only look at the Eiffel tower from the outside?

Why go to Paris at all? Why do you insist on going up the Eiffel tower? Why would you insist on eating the pricey food at McDonalds AND buying a ticket for the Eiffel tower?
Why not buy food and a cheap bottle of wine in the students quarter or one of the (super)markets and go to the Centre Pompidou / Trocadero / Tuileries or the Seine where the local youth gathers or some guys/gals show their skills with music instruments or on roller skates or so?

Sorry to say, but you have very specific and money intensive ideas of what cheap holidays in Paris are. And don't think that 8,50 € just to go up the ridiculously boring Tour Eiffel for 30 minutes is no money for someone not yet in a job after school. Shit adds up.
We opted for beer, wine, café au lait, espresso and Pompidou on our tour de force.

I was inspired to start this thread after seeing some of the comments across various Reddit threads and having had some time to think about this issue myself.

As Spain continues it's growth as a modern nation, what are your thoughts on helping it mature as a democracy? For those not aware, Spain has only been a democracy for the past 4 decades and has spent much of it's history being ruled by absolute rulers with brief periods of democracy sprinkled within. So for example, unlike England or the United States which has centuries of norms and standards to go by, Spain is still developing those norms and learning how to respond to threats that could undermine the strength of it's democracy both from within the government and outside of the government.

As we all know, Spain has just finished experiencing a constitutional crisis which has exposed how short sighed some decisions made in the past were both by the central government and in the generalitat.

I'll start with the central government first. I was reading an interview earlier today by John Elliot and in it, he talked about how the government in Spain has made the error of devolving too much powers to comunidades based on difference while also neglecting other comunidades. One consequence he states is that it has led to an educational environment where the focus is on difference rather than diversity and not coming to an understanding of how much progress has been made over the past 4 decades as Spain has become a democracy. What do you think?

I also think the king and the current ruling party are to blame as well. I think they correctly made the right decision to point out that the everything must run through the current constitutional framework. Where I think they went wrong is that was trying to use that as a persuasion tactic since it wasn't going to change the hearts of voters with separatist sentiments. I think the king in particular blundered a lot by pointing this out but not even offering a conciliatory tone to the people who were hurt. He is supposed to be the symbolic head of state and a neutral party, but I can understand why people didn't view him that way. Unlike his father, he wasn't very involved in trying to diffuse the situation to my knowledge. I posted a poll as this threads image that the central government and the king could have used to help them think about the situation and win people to their side. I'll explain more about that later. What do you think?


I am pro-union and pro-constitution and I'm not going to hide that fact. Anyone who has see my post here will also recognize that. Now I will try to explain why I also think the separatist are to blame as well. 

First and foremost, I think that the separatist politicians have played the politics of difference and division to help them gather support and fracture Catalonian society. They'll make statements about fascism, the state robbing them, and being oppressed while simultaneously saying they love Spain and the EU even though their support for the EU constitution vote was among the lowest in Spain.

The separatist politicians used that anger to drive forward a referendum that they knew would trigger a constitutional crisis because they hoped that it would drive Madrid to the table to negotiate either a referendum or more devolution of power. This isn't particularly new since previous governments in Catalonia have used similar tactics to do the same thing. It's easy to understand why this came to a head because eventually you're going to run against a wall if that's your method.  While they were setting out to implement this task, they asked Madrid if they could hold one and were unexpectedly told no. As a political tactic they kept asking so they could drive anti-Madrid anger by claiming they asked 19 times. This has had the unfortunate side effect of polarizing Spanish society and driving up both Spanish nationalism and Catalonian regionalism. Polarized societies in a democracy are dangerous because they hard to mend and it makes compromise difficult since politics begins to be about identity rather than making decisions based on the good of the community.


As Spanish society moves forward, I think it's really important for politicians to tone down their language. Thankfully we are seeing evidence of this from Madrid since they are taking their time to make separatist citizens feel more included with their language. Now it seems like the PP and PSOE want to begin a debate about constitutional reform. Some people on here like the idea of a federal state and that could be on the table. What are you thoughts? How do you think a federal state might help to make Spain a state for everyone and respectful of autonomous, linguistic and cultural differences while halting nationalism?

I think more moderate Catalonian politicians also need to reflect on how they can make Catalonia and Spain work together while rejecting regionalism. The image I posted is taken from a poll done by a Catalan organization. They asked people where they think Catalonia should. As you can see from the poll, most people reject separatism. Instead the majority seem to want either a federal state within Spain, to continue their existence as a comunidad, or be recognized as a region. Moderate Catalonian politicians should use this information to help build a consensus within Catalonia so that they and the central government in Madrid can work together to make Spain a stronger country in a way that aligns with the constitution that everyone voted for rather than circumventing it. This would hopefully put an end to the black and white separatist vision of the world that separatist politicians thrive on. 

Maybe that consensus may require constitutional changes, but the path to build political change to reform the constitution is to practice a politics of inclusion. People listen when they feel included and when people feel included they are more likely to want to help you build a coalition to reach bring about those changes. It won't just be about Catalonia. Instead it will be about how Catalonia and the rest of Spain can come together to make Spain better.

1857,"&gt;The UK is still the most attractive European country for employers and staff, despite the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, according to a report by Colliers International.

&gt;A combination of talent, location, quality of life and cost puts Britain ahead, the commercial property company said. London ranks first in the league table of 50 European cities, with Birmingham, Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow also featuring in the top 20.

&gt;[S]imon Ford, a director at Colliers, said: “In the face of negative reports surrounding the UK’s political, social, economic and country risk issues, our research demonstrates that the country as a whole remains in a particularly strong position.

&gt;“While London may not score as highly as other European cities on some quality of life factors, it is apparent that companies in the capital have started to place more emphasis on creating workplaces that help accelerate their business and attract talent.”

&gt;The government has insisted in recent weeks that London and the UK will remain an attractive place for business to invest after Britain leaves the EU. There are fears, however, that in the absence of any clarity on a potential deal with the EU, multinational firms are preparing to activate their Brexit contingency plans and move jobs from the UK to other European towns and cities where they will enjoy guaranteed access to the single market.

&gt;Frankfurt is one of the frontrunners among a host of European cities hoping to attract banking and financial services jobs away from London after Brexit, as businesses seek guaranteed access to the single market. Dublin, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam and Luxembourg are also contenders.

&gt;However, according to Colliers’s analysis, London beats Paris into second place as the most attractive city for firms and employees. Ford said part of the reason why London was ahead of Paris in the study was its broader catchment area, giving it access to a bigger workforce beyond the M25. Frankfurt is ranked in 14th place as the most attractive city for employees and 15th for employers.

&gt;Colliers said that while Brexit had made the UK a riskier place to invest, it was still among the lowest-risk European countries to set up and operate a business.

&gt;Damian Harrington, head of European research at Colliers, said: “It is clear from our analysis that the operational risk profile of the UK has weakened as a result of Brexit, more so than any other European country since 2014. Yet it remains one of the lowest-risk European countries to set up and operate a business, and the added benefit of far more flexible labour laws means UK cities take a very strong standing.”",The West,/r/europe/comments/79i2f5/uk_most_attractive_european_country_for_employers/dp22nss/,Occidentarian,1509300872

&gt;I'll start with the central government first ... What do you think?
I disagree, the only way forward is the opposite, more decentralization, becoming a federal state, if Spain doesnt become a nation of nations, Spain will be broken in less than a couple of decades.

&gt;I also think the king and the current ruling party ... What do you think?

The PP and king have made the situation a hundred times more difficult than everyone hoped to be, by refusing to even negotiate terms for a non-binding catalunyan referendum, they have only made things worse. That combined with the disproportinate amount of police brutality have only made radicals on both sides. I would argue that the push of Spanish Nationalism by the central government is much more scary than the reaction of the Catalan politicians.

A referendum should have been made on a III Republic when the last king stepped down, nothing happened and sadly nothing will, at least in the near future.

&gt;First and foremost ... lowest in Spain.

While I think its fair to critisize the Catalan politicians for pushing some narratives , denying the absolute misery of the last decade is not fair, the crysis, housing market, unemployment, corruption, these are all things that have influenced much more the political landscape than Catalan rethoric.

A source for the European approval would be nice, since its the first time I hear that. Just want to read more.

You don't get that, as a spaniard.

The only time you didn't get that, was when ETA was active. But alas, ETA attacked catalans, too —and plenty of them, quote Ernest Lluch, quote Hipercor.

Let me defend my point in a different way so you know what I mean.

If you don't, it would be unfair hypocrisy.

If you do, you're subjecting Catalonia to *extreme* uncertainty (not mentioning the economic impact).

You said earlier:

&gt; The usual argument against the 50%, saying it should instead be 60 or 2/3rds, is that there's going to be unrest after a ref of this nature. But that's known, and the unrest is already there, and the unrest is greater the more uncertainty we have. The ref is to give certainty; it's a parting, civilised point, not a finishing one.

1971,"[Brexit and
the EU budget - HOUSE OF LORDS
European Union Committee](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/125.pdf)  

&gt;On the basis of the legal opinions we have considered we conclude
that, as a matter of EU law, Article 50 TEU allows the UK to leave the
EU without being liable for outstanding financial obligations under
the EU budget and related financial instruments, unless a withdrawal
agreement is concluded which resolves this issue.  

&gt;The EU Treaties are at the pinnacle of the hierarchy of EU law; all
subordinate EU legislation derives from them. Once the Treaties cease
to apply to the UK, all EU legal obligations found in Regulations,
Directives and Decisions and other EU acts cease to apply under EU
law.   

&gt;The current total capitalised EU pension liability is recorded as €63.8
billion. If the UK were to accept a liability for any of this, our witnesses
suggested that its share could be calculated by reference to the UK’s
average contribution to the EU budget (between 8% and 15%), the
proportion of those currently serving in EU institutions who are UK
nationals (4%), or the proportion of those in receipt of an EU pension
who are UK nationals (8%). The total liability on this basis would be
likely to come to between €2.5 billion and €9.6 billion. However, an
accurate assessment of any potential liability could involve a complex
actuarial calculation of pension rights accrued by those serving in the
EU institutions while the UK was a member, whether UK nationals or
not. Negotiations may also encompass a figure for capitalised pension
liabilities that is in practice substantially lower than €63.8 billion.  

&gt;The EU has a range of assets. They total €153.7 billion, and include property,
equipment, loans and investments, and cash and other fungible assets. ",,/r/europe/comments/79bou1/we_now_have_evidence_that_theresa_may_triggered/dp1wdrp/,gripper279,1509293557

2009,"You're not OP but I'll reply nonetheless.

Please realise how most of your relevant arguments work the same for the other side. I'll edit your argumentation for the sake of debate:

(1) Spain never has enough.

(2) Spain never makes unreasonable demands.

(3) I don't know what you mean with ""treaded"", sorry.

(4) The subsidised autonomies have never been economically or politically favored by the central gov in exchange for their votes there.

(5) RTVE does the same, they've said so themselves. Also, in TV3 defence, RTVE does get emitted there too —Reversely, TV3 and CatRadio doesn't get their way into Valencian territory, because of political will, which has been leaving hundreds of thousands of valencian speakers without any public tv in their language for a while.

(6) If spaniards wanted catalans to love them, maybe they shouldn't have been benefitting from the money of the catalan countries —which are richer by geographical privilege— while at the same time they hold contempt for catalans openly, through public opinion and their representatives. Quote Ibarra saying that they're the ones financing Catalonia. That happens regularly, daily, in the Spanish Congress. You may not notice it, but we do. (A place, btw, the Spanish Congress, where the national minorities of Spain can't express themselves in their language —unlike the Catalan Parliament, where spanish is plenty and politically used.)

&gt;Look, I'm no Unionist. I'm a republican. Being republican is THE one thing I can wholeheartedly cheer for in the Independentist discourse.

Good to know.

I have friends from andalusian origin —that like you are republican— that don't like it either, but are in for it —or would be, in a ref. vote, something they can't have (and that's why they'll vote Podemos instead or PSC)— because they see Spain and there's just no hope there. Instead of pushing for progressism, the country is going backwards. Any Constitutional reform points in recentralisation instead.

&gt;I can't object (and I don't) a proper referendum, but what got done in 1O was an Absolute Farce; and only worsened by the Central Government and the King. In my opinion, what the central government should have done is BACKING the referendum, making sure it follows guarantees and procedures, and make it binding. But no, monarchists gotta be stupid like they've always been.

I don't see why you have to deem it a farce.

&gt;But you can't expect to garner wide support with what is essentially a huge ""fuck you"" to the rest of your fellow Iberians; all the while your ""leaders"" and the monarchist ""leaders"" are entirely willing to throw the whole State into fear, disarray and even more economic problems.

Honestly, the fuck you we received is way bigger. We only want to leave, after all, and we're being beaten over it. It's not like we want to tell spaniards what they should do over their territory; it's the other way around.

&gt;It says a lot about how fucked we really are when the most level-headed and calm communication came from the current Carlist heir...

Yes.

And you propose to fix Spain, how, if I may ask?

2062,"Don""t worry. It's not a blame game of any sorts. It's more-or-less what's been going on in the present. There are many families born into poverty, and it's not their own fault by any means. It's just their way of life that they've always known.  

Many of them are hard-working already, but not all of them are stable. They could also have the thought process of ""I'm not good enough"", but that's not true. 

We've already been through redistribution of wealth. Hasn't changed much of their outcomes. However, when we hear stories of them achieving better things in their lives, that's when we know that something in their lifestyle has changed and it's not because of money. It's their own willpower/determination that they're able to achieve something no one else has done in their family. :) 

I hope something like that continues to grow in the inner cities. 

America, as you know, has a gun problem. In some of our inner cities, that is what some of the youth gets a hold of when they don't have any positive outlets to go to. That's why we have many organizations out there that are made to target these young people so they discover something worth living for than joining a gang or doing small crime. It's progress like this that only makes you hope for their future to get better. 

As for the homeless problem, we have the standard soup kitchens and organizations for them too. Yet, the homeless have also built their own small communities out of parks and wooded areas. Everyone's story is different. Some people really prefer to be homeless than be helped.

^(disclaimer, I don't follow the news closely enough so I really encourage fellow Lithuanians to correct me where I'm wrong or expand upon my notes, and I want to hear more important news)

* The Gediminas hill in Vilnius had another tiny mudslide. Earlier in the week some sharp-eyed compatriot had noticed that there are *mushrooms growing out of the side of the hill* and written article about it. All eyes on the hill, if it falls so does Lithuania.

* Apparently the apple harvest is outstanding after all, except it needs to be picked very quickly because it's rainy and everything rots.

* Completely new Jew wartime Soviet civil war drama that will surely bring out the best in our society: a journalist/writer/personality has claimed that a leader of our partisan movement, [Adolfas Ramanauskas-Vanagas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfas_Ramanauskas), was an agent of KGB, committed crimes and killed Jews. Her books, including the newly published one she was advertising, were recalled by the publishing house and the largest supermarket chain. It turns out she's been in a relationship with Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff for a year, which was the most shocking thing to me since I know a lot of people who had unpleasant dealings with him and he called Lithuanians ""animals"".

* Our most famous designer Juozas Statkevičius gave an [interview to Sputnik](https://sputniknewslv.com/interview/20171024/6254467/Dizaineris-modeletajs-statkevics-lietuva-propaganda-apnikusi-emigracija.html) (link in Latvian ), called a Russian government propaganda channel, saying Lithuania sucks and there is too much anti-Russian propaganda.

Here is a picture and a video of Erdo from this morning, trying to not explode from rage, while he has to pay his respects to Atatürk, and celebrate the Republic day. He has to this at all national holidays, and next, on the 10th of November, he will have to commemorate Atatürk's death and so on.

If he had tried to avoid those, he'd further polarize the nation, and he's starting to realize polarization is starting to do him more harm than good, especially since the attempted coup. 
For instance before the coup, him and his like, used to call in sick at national holidays, and let the celebrations go on without them etc. 
In the speech he gave today, he even addressed Atatürk as ""Atatürk"", which he hates pronouncing (he rather called him ""Mustafa Kemal the Veteran"", to only recognize him for his war achievements, and ignore his founding role in the republic). 


What most western media don't get is that Erdogan is barely starting to realize how to create a  new generation that is pro-Erdogan, not keen on the republican and secular values. He was good at getting all the power in his hands, but we will see if he will manage to keep it.
His ideology has been in power for 15 years, and this is the first year where he managed to tone down the republican romanticism in primary school history books, remove evolution, or find a legal framework for religious marriage. If he manages to keep this going for another decade or so, by increasing these changes and significantly increasing censorship on the Internet, his counter-revolution can have a viable chance to hold on, otherwise, the republican revolution will surely overcome, and keep its position. 

But now a serious economic crisis is approaching, his voter base has started got affected by many of his misdoings, and a potential right-wing alternative for them is starting to form for the 2019 elections. If there isn't an external intervention, or if he does not drag the country on total war in middle east, I don't think he will keep his place. If all goes well, all his doings could be seen a 30-40 years of progress that were stolen from the country, and hopefully avoid people from giving in to such power hungry populists. But knowing what he risks if he loses, unfortunately I don't think he would give up so easily, and make us suffer, unless he is betrayed by his surroundings.",,/r/europe/comments/79cr6p/94_years_ago_today_republic_was_declared_in/dp1nkfy/,StannisIsNotDead,1509278946

That Catalonia is not oppressed and should work within the legal framework if it really wishes to secede, because what they want to do is take land and infrastructure from Spain. Spain deserves a vote because they have the same rights as Catalans, a language and culture does not give them a special right to ignore the constitution. If Catalonia was oppressed and mistreated like slaves I would fully support their secession even if it means war. 

Economically there is no argument that can be used to support the independence. Culture wise I also can't think of one because Catalonia is free and even has laws that restrict Castiliano. independence to me looks like something that would be bad or the same(as in same basic rights) in every way except for having a Catalan passport and Catalan politicians having more power in a less stable, poorer Country. Catalan politicians are also extremely corrupt just like their fellow country man.

&gt; This is world war one not the nazis.

You were talking of Napoleon, Wilhelm the second and Hitler. 

While Germany definitely wasn't the only one responsible for WW1, it sure as hell wasn't the only reason for ""no unity"". If you're seriously blaming the conflict between Germany and France, as well as between Germany and Russia just on the British Empire, I strongly advise you to take some history lessons. 

The Entente power didn't fight for liberty but their own interests (for example in case of Italy just for their own Imperialistic ambitions of expanding their lands), but they were a great counter measure to Imperialistic greed of the Axis powers. Without that counter measure many European nations would have lost their liberty and independence.

Having help from West doesn't mean help from Hungary. NATO will not help us anyway. Simply because we will never get approval of all members. So NATO and EU are organizations we will never be able join to. With or without approval from Hungary.

So getting help from West is not linked to NATO or EU, it is linked to individual members. 

&gt; It is purely because you are actively acting against your own interests and making it harder for yourself to join these western organisations.

not really, you want to make use of our weakness, but in exchange you should get nothing. This case would be just yet another example of how impotent NATO and EU are if Hungary can block something there.

2300,"It's a huge mash of various architecture styles, ranging from the Norman Tower of London, through lots of industrial Victorian, to Brutalist and High tech Architecture.

I'm not a londoner, but I really enjoy the creativity in architectural design in London.  What I find most fascinating is the ingenuity in urban areas to maximise the space.  Plots of land are so expensive, people carve out their residential homes to fit in some unusually shaped spaces.

Also, modern renovations are sympathetic to styles which are not fashionable in the rest of the country, maintaining the shabby industrial feel of many buildings.  For example [Trellick tower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trellick_Tower) has cult status in London - you'll see it associated with types of musical movements, or on mugs.  However, I'd say most non-londoners would say it's ugly.

Cities like Paris, Lisbon, Prague, Rome have a more consistent universal appeal in the architecture.  Maybe partly because large parts of it were built at similar times, but also because modern work is sympathetic to the overall style.

I think in the short term is more feasible to get a reform from PP than a referendum but with PP it has always been a dead way, Junts knew it, they could have asked for another thing while doing pedagogy of their cause to be more legitimate in Catalonia.


Because Reality is, Independentist have lost the battle, They can still win if PP kills someone on a rogue action but it is unlikely we will see what happened on 1-O. No international support, no internal cohesion for independence, bad economic perspectives and a shitshow those days.

The plague caused an acute labor shortage across Europe. In parts of Europe, he said, the result was improved conditions for the laborers. In other parts the result was more oppression, a restrengthening of the feudal system with reduced rights for workers.

He told me that he could draw a line between the two large regions, and when he saw it, he was startled. It was very close to the line of the “Iron Curtain” that (at the time he did this) divided Europe into democratic and autocratic regions.

This thought fascinated me. The idea that the oppression of Eastern Europe dated back to the 1300s was amazing. (Of course, now that I am gaining in age, that period doesn’t seem as remote as it did when I was younger.)

He's saying France has a country and aren't under Spain, Italy have a country and aren't under Spain, Portugal have a country and aren't under Spain despite being closer to Spain than the Catalans (I disagree and he didn't explicitly say this but I wouldn't be surprised if he believes it), etc. Why doesn't the Catalan group have a nation state when all other similarly distinct cultures do, that's his point. Not to mention Catalan culture was expressly forbidden for the majority of the 20th century and so you can understand the thoughts of incompatibility.

Once people see violence from a centralised government movements become far more unpredictable and are easier for other parties to co-opt or accelerate the undergoing processes.

Blind adherence to legality and this cult of constitutionality is going to cause a lot more problems that you will inevitably blame on Catalonia. The law is not perfect and, above all, reflects the desires and moral compass of the people in power not the population. All I'm going to say is that well over 1000 unarmed people wanted to legally vote and were not allowed, so they tried doing it themselves and were beaten for it. That hardly seems like the law acting in the interests of the citizens.

Normalising excessive police force and brutality is a terrible thing and be careful not to fall into that trap just because you don't like the people being beaten.

As for the last comment are you seriously trying to play on my sense of nationalism in an emotional appeal? Because if you are then lol really? Castile and Castilians have been much worse to Portugal than Catalonia.  And I'm not petty enough to have that factor into my judgement at all.

It's worse that you're flat out lying by saying he's calling us *Untermensch*.

I have been following the Catalonian indepence problem for a while now and there are a few things that don't make sense to me on how this country could even be run:

1. No country has so far recognized Catalonias attempt for independence but many big ones have said no (including the EU) which means that if the borders would be moved now all those people would be ""stateless"" to everybody else. They can not go anywhere, not France, not Spain or not to any country since they don't hold a passport and even if they had they still couldn't apply for a visa since the country is not recognized. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Republic_(2017).

2. Since no other country either has recognized Catalonia that would mean that import export would go down to 0. How can you buy or sell anything to a country which is not recognized by anyone? Maybe it could be kept at a very low level but the import prices alone into e.g. EU would be a problem, that is what UK is worried about now with their Brexit deal and they have over a year left.

3. Airplane traffic would most likely be heavily affected since Catalonia is a not recognized country and not a member of ICAO. How do you ensure the safety of your plane if it goes into an unrecognized country? How do you make sure that air traffic control does their job correctly? What if an accident happens, will insurance companies cover you? The same goes the other way. Can a Catalan airplane exit via EU traffic control area?

4. Puigdemont has been seen multiple times with an European flag in the background even though the EU has said multiple times that it would not recognize it as a country, What is he expecting? That breaking the Spanish constitution (which was voted yes in 1978 with 95% in Catalonia) would make people listen to him? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_constitutional_referendum,_1978. 
To get into the EU among many things you need to have proven that you are a stable country for may years. Breaking a law you accepted 40 years ago does not seem like going the right way.

5. Another thing I found weird is the entire vote result. The polls where all round 50% but with the police breakup a lot of weird things happened and all of a sudden 90% voted yes? One article mentions also some other weird irregularities like this: ""In 71 municipalities the number of ""yes"" votes tallied were more than the number of registered voters for those municipalities according to the census"". I find it very hard to take that vote seriously.

6. Since no people or trade can move in or out all international companies would move or go bankrupt and that process has already started. https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/the-companies-leaving-catalonia-in-the-face-of-political-uncertainty.html. (If your don't trust CNBC check out other sources.) Thereby a lot of economy itself is already lost there.

Luckily today nobody is taking Puigdemont seriously so everything is still going normally but if that stopped that could have horrible consequences for the Catalonia.

The head of PSOE (the biggest left national party), until a few months ago talked about Spain being a ""nation of nations"", and a year ago was saying ""No, no"" to whatever Rajoy said, and has (and had) a lot of internal problems with its Catalan branch. Ciudadanos (center-liberal) tries to unite everyone under a common cause but the radical left calls them fascists and PP (Rajoy's party, center-right) either ignores them or tries to not agree too much, because they fear their voters could flee to Ciudadanos. The radical left (biggest party, Podemos) has either allied with separatism and/or is just critizing the application of Art. 155 and not saying anything useful.

Rajoy has always had the problem of having the appeal of a piece of cardboard. He's an old-school politican and doesn't seem to understand that now a modern politician must give a clear image of openness (a couple years ago, most of his interventions and declarations to the press were made from another room through a TV screen. It was live, but he wasn't in the same room as the journalists), and he likes too much to do things on the background, while for the rest of the country it seems that he's sitting on his thumbs. Meanwhile the Catalan goverment has spent tons of money opening ""embassies"" to lobby politicians from other countries to their cause, and always accepts interviews from journalists so they can insert the image that they are a an actual country being oppressed. Rajoy has won to his side the opinion of most countries (the EU, the USA, etc...), but has given a very bad public image to the common people (see police charges on October 1st).",,/r/europe/comments/7952qg/the_government_of_spain_dismiss_the_whole/dp133ig/,Versec,1509235994

2759,"Thanks for the kind words :) Here are my thoughts about your questions: 

(a) You're right. This means it will not be easy but it's also not impossible.

(b) A country that declares independence like this is never recognized instantly. afaik Slovenia needed 6 months to get the first international support. Basically, support will come if Catalonia proves that it can function as an independent nation and Spain no longer has control over it. I mean, this makes sense: who would want to piss off Spain without knowing that Catalonia is going to work as an independent State? Legitimacy or friendships between Spain and other countries only delay the international support, they don't remove it.

(c) Let's hope it doesn't get to that. We have never been violent, and even though I don't trust the EU at all at least I hope they don't condone violence. Donald Tusk and many nations already asked for a peaceful outcome from all this.

(d) Yeah I saw that post here too, it's fake. Catalan government has not capitulated at all. The government is avoiding putting public workers at risk by letting them quit if they want. But the government will keep going. It would be incredibly stupid to declare indepence and the next day surrender just because Rajoy dismissed the Catalan government (it was obvious this was gonna happen).

(e) eh, there's no real way of knowing that. We haven't been allowed a referendum. In my opinion, before declaring independence, it had a support of a bit over 50%. But now, there are people who didn't want independence but now that it's been declared, they don't want to go back (or just don't care). Nobody knows how big is this part of the demographic so it's impossible to tell. What is true is that independence is overwhelmingly a majority in the countryside, so if the Spanish government intends to hold elections in december they will have a really hard time putting ballot boxes in every town. And by law, if a Spanish election gets less than 20% turnout, it can't be considered valid.

All in all, what the Catalan government is doing at the moment remains a secret and nobody is really sure. I've seen some people that say they are declaring independence ""slowly"" (notice that in Puigdemont message today he didn't mention Republic), they want to go step by step. 

But we've been feeling in a similar way in the past (right before the referendum, and the declaration, nobody was sure of what would happen), and so far the Catalan government has not disappointed us, so I trust they know what they're doing.",República catalana,/r/europe/comments/799aao/independence_of_catalonia_puigdemont_and_its/dp13f6d/,Brainwashed_ignorant,1509236437

After a long discussion about helping parents with paying for childcare, CDU/CSU and FDP introduced a child care subsidy which is paid directly to the parents.

First, I'd like to say that I feel like this day is more than just a national holiday for Turks. 

The Ottoman Empire is famous. Its conquests, brutalities, breakthroughs, culture... All in all, the Ottoman Empire is known for many things. 

Its commoners, however, are not as famous. Until the summer of 1922, when the last Greco-Turkish war ended; those commoners had lived through a world war, a war in the Balkans, a war with the Russians, full invasion of their lands, and finally a war for their homeland. 

Needless to say, that's a lot of wars. They were poor, uneducated, and forgotten. They, their fathers before them, and their fathers before them had all fought in wars and they were tired. 

So, when the Republic of Turkey was formed, this was the general state of the Turkish people. Illiterate, unqualified, and poor villagers were all that remained of a mighty Empire. In just ten years Atatürk's revolution, which centralized around these ""villagers"", gave them the right to vote, ended slavery, freed them of religous dogmas, and most importantly gave them a vision. 

You see, Republic to us Turks is not just a form of government where the people elect their representatives through voting, no. It's not just the abolition of monarchy. It means progress, freedom, civilization, enlightenment, and prosperity. 

It represents the struggle of a nation striving to free itself from darkness to achieve total freedom of thought; away from the dogmas, away from the grasp of tribalism and blindfolded religion. It represents the failure of Imperialism.

This is why the Repuplic Day of Turkey is not just about Turks. It carries out a beacon of hope that every man is equal and no matter the circumstances;  progress always wins. 

Happy Republic Day everyone and don't forget about the struggle of the Turkish nation on its way to progress and the truth. Today, what we call European values are the foundation stones of the Turkish Republic and one day I hope that we will fully achieve the vision granted to those poor villagers, to our fathers and mothers.

The EU envisages provisions in the agreement on principles of environmental protection in a trade and sustainable development chapter.

There were lawsuits against the ban. The judges stated reasons why the ban should stay in effect. 

&gt; Legal background
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3  
&gt; Article 8a of Council Directive 89/622/EEC of 13 November 1989 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the labelling of tobacco products (OJ 1989 L 359, p. 1), as amended by Council Directive 92/41/EEC of 15 May 1992 (OJ 1992 L 158, p. 30), (‘Directive 89/622’) provides that the Member States are to prohibit the placing on the market of tobacco for oral use, defined in Article 2(4) of that directive as ‘all products for oral use, except those intended to be smoked or chewed, made wholly or partly of tobacco, in powder or particulate form or in any combination of these forms – particularly those presented in sachet portions or porous sachets – or in a form resembling a food product’.  
&gt; 
&gt; 4  
&gt; The 11th recital in the preamble to Directive 92/41 states that ‘it has been proved that smokeless tobacco products are a major risk factor as regards cancer and … they should therefore carry a specific warning of that risk’. According to the 12th recital in that preamble, ‘scientific experts are of the opinion that the addiction caused by tobacco consumption constitutes a danger meriting a specific warning on every tobacco product’.  
&gt; 
&gt; 5   
&gt; According to the 13th recital in the preamble to Directive 92/41:  
&gt; ‘… new tobacco products for oral use which have appeared on the market in certain Member States are particularly attractive to young people and … the Member States most exposed to this problem have already placed total bans on these new tobacco products or intend so to do’.  
&gt; 
&gt; 6  
&gt; The 14th recital in that preamble states:  
&gt; ‘… regarding such products, there are differences between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States and … these products therefore need to be made subject to common rules’.
&gt; 
&gt; 7  
&gt; According to the 15th recital in the preamble:  
&gt; ‘... there is a real risk that the new products for oral use will be used above all by young people, thus leading to nicotine addiction, unless restrictive measures are taken in time’.
&gt;  
&gt; 8  
&gt; According to the 16th recital in the preamble:  
&gt; ‘… in accordance with the conclusions of the studies conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, tobacco for oral use contains particularly large quantities of carcinogenic substances; … these new products cause cancer of the mouth in particular’.
&gt;   
&gt; 9  
&gt; According to the 17th recital in the preamble to that directive:  
&gt; ‘… the sales bans on such tobacco already adopted by three Member States have a direct impact on the establishment and operation of the internal market; … it is therefore necessary to approximate Member States’ laws, regulations and administrative provisions in this area, taking as a base a high level of health protection; … the only appropriate measure is a total ban; … however, such a ban should not affect traditional tobacco products for oral use, which will remain subject to the provisions of Directive 89/622/EEC, as amended by this Directive, applicable to smokeless tobacco products’.

TL:DR: Oral consumption of tobacco is used by young people. Besides smoking and chewing tobacco oral tobacco consumption had no tradition in the 1989 EU. Therefor it was banned.

Co si budeme, musíš mít fakt vysoké IQ, abys rozuměl Comebacku. Humor je velmi skrytý a nepovrchní a divák musí mít slušné znalosti teoretické fyziky, aby mu vtipy neunikaly.

Stop blaming it for all ills and use the remaining 93% for the good of your people, and for hells sake stop staring at Russia, it's unhealthy when our channels use conflict for cheap chauvinist propaganda, but at least Putin can show how his economic policy of inflation reduction is working as a way to deal with sanctions, what can Poroshenko show to his nation? An association agreement that further ruined the economy? A visa liberalisation that will only encourage depopulation and brain drain?

Well yes, but same charge can be levied against European oligarchs, who contrary to the opinion popular on this sub do exist, just not in the same per capita quantities, pressuring Yanukovich to sign association despite economic damage it would do, and have already done, to Ukraine, according to both eastern and western economists, due to closure of Russian markets it would provoke and extremely low quotas for Ukrainian goods entering EU markets, so low in fact that agricultural goods, that are the main selling point of the economy Poroshenko government is promoting, [are tiny and not nearly enough to sustain those sectors.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/business/ukraine-eu-agriculture-eggs-trade.html) and Ukrainian Industry is simply not competitive on western markets, like it is one eastern ones, so even increase in quotas isn't enough to compensate for the economic losses suffered.

Not saying it was good on either side, but Russia was offering a more economically viable plan for Ukraine and both sides were clearly out for their own interests.

3030,"&gt;Yes, a legitimate one not a sham one where 67% of the electorate didn't vote in it.

Exactly, the Catalan people should be afforded the right to determine their own future via a sanctioned referendum. This is my entire point. 

&gt;Polls show an equal split and even then many of the pro-Independence voters would support remaining in Spain under certain circumstances. 

As is their prerogative. Both unionist and nationalists should be able to exercise their view on the issue in a state sanctioned referendum.  

&gt;It is not, it is literally against Spanish law and Spain is a fully functioning democracy with the rule of law so you can't claim that they were oppressed, other than to push a victim narrative.

I accept the fact that secession is against Spanish law, but both law and morality are not necessarily mutually inclusive with one and the other. One can still enforce the law whilst carrying out morally questionable acts. Just to use one example: the internment of Japanese citizens was both sanctioned by a democratic government and upheld by a constitutional/supreme court of law. This fact, at least to me, has no baring on the moral implications of internment. As for the 'rule of law', it's such a vacuous term.

3081,"I disagree.

With the EU, this is a substantial concern in that many competencies have been transferred from member countries to the EU.  That is, members cannot act in those fields if a veto is present.  If the EU is the only entity that can sign a trade agreement, then countries may have difficulty signing trade agreements.  That's necessary for some of the things that the EU does — you couldn't have a customs union without preventing individual countries from acting on trade without constraint.

That is not generally true of NATO.  Normally, anything a country can do under NATO that it would care about can also be done by a member country outside of NATO.  Hungary cannot, for example, veto French action in Mali, even though both are members of NATO.  So it doesn't have the same paralyzing effect.  That's reasonable because NATO isn't some sort of exclusive organization.

Expanding NATO is one of the few exceptions, and it's not one that I object to having a veto on, because countries should not be willy-nilly committing to the security of other countries.

I do object to Hungary leveraging this to obtain something unrelated to security, but that's a different matter — I do not think that removal of the veto is a good way to address the issue.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/795iqx/hungary_blocks_ukrainenato_commission_session_in/dp0n3xk/,vokegaf,1509214778

3214,"Data is data, there isn't an engineering limitation making 10 MB worth of data spent redditting cost more than 10 MB of data spent sending pictures to your friends over WhatsApp. It takes up the same amount of bandwidth either way.

But you are right that you, as a consumer who only wants to use WhatsApp for instance, would pay less under this plan. But what are consumers as a whole giving up for that savings, and why is the WhatsApp-only plan cheaper? It's because the ISP has some financial benefit to do so. WhatsApp probably pays some premium to be in the cheap plan, thus subsidizing it to make it cheaper. The reason why this is bad is because it hurts the instant messaging market. Instant messaging apps only work if the people you want to talk to use it. This makes it very hard a fledgling instant messaging app to unseat an established player. Why would I jump onboard a new app when I know a section of the population can't access it on their data plans? A new company can't afford to pay to be on these cheaper plans to make sure that all consumers have access to their service. The ISP just created an artificial barrier to enter the full market.

ISPs can use these discount plans to push customers into using their services. They will always have a vested interest in pushing their products, you can use your ISP's streaming service on the cheap plan, but Netflix needs to pay the ISP to be on the cheap plan too, or the consumer has to pay more to get access to Netflix.

There are a lot of things like these cheaper plans that seem great in the short term, but are toxic to consumer protections and to the free marketplace where ideally best services are the ones that succeed, not the ones that pay to have access to the entire market.",,/r/europe/comments/799qzu/in_portugal_internet_providers_are_starting_to/dp0c0cg/,ChaoticOccasus,1509199678

Funny you should write that.

This is just giving preferential treatment to a handful of services by making them more attractive in comparison to everyone else and offering an incentive to cut deals with the ISP. It's less expensive because the ISP is offering this service at cost or with slim margins compared to any other kind of data plan so that they can create a market down the road (if it's not already happening) where service providers pay to be included into this privileged package while the ISP offers the consumer no choice over which services get to be included and maintaining their relevancy even if the userbase has moved onto a better one. The ISP profits, the service provider gets to pay their way into forced relevancy through monopoly via what essentially is a bribe, and the rest of the consumers get to subsidize it all, plus get pressured into adopting these particular services instead of the ones they currently use while it all happens by having their data discriminated against just because they don't use whatever shit the ISP is shilling in that year's package.",,/r/europe/comments/799qzu/in_portugal_internet_providers_are_starting_to/dp0ce5v/,so_witty_username_v2,1509200290

Democracy is not just an act of voting. It's also respect for rule of law. The Catalonian government has disrespected the Constitution (which was implemented in a referendum) and therefore the people of Spain - including Catalans. They failed to show a justifiable reason to do so - they are not oppressed by any means and separation is possible, albeit difficult. 

If we were to disrespect this principle, we wouldn't be living in a democracy, but in a country led by mob rule.

3445,"&gt;Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría has assumed the majority of competencies corresponding to the president and vice president of the Generalitat after the application of article 155 of the Constitution, according to the royal decrees published at the dawn of this Saturday by the Official State Gazette (BOE). Following the dismissals of Carles Puigdemont, Oriol Junqueras and all members of the Government, the Vice-President will play a key role in coordinating the Executive's intervention in Catalonia. Three decisions underline this circumstance. First, that President Mariano Rajoy has delegated to Sáenz de Santamaría the competences that corresponded to him. Second, the vice president has control of the Center for Telecommunications and Information Technology (CTTI). And third, that also assume the command of the CESICAT (the call CNI Catalan); of the official gazette of the Autonomous Community; and its center of opinion studies.

&gt;In addition, the ministers of Rajoy will take charge of the 11 Catalan autonomous councils after the cessation of all the councilors, who are the following: Jordi Turull, Raül Romeva, Clara Ponsatí, Josep Rull, Meritxell Borràs, Antoni Comín, Dolors Bassa, Joaquim Forn, Lluís Puig, Carles Mundó and Meritxell Serret. Each ministry will be responsible for coordinating the work of the corresponding Council of the Generalitat and the Council of Ministers will serve as a meeting point to have an overview.

&gt;""In any case, the previous authorizations will be made subject to the principles of prudence and proportionality and with full respect for the Autonomy of Catalonia,"" emphasizes the government decree published by the BOE, which also argues the need to ""ensure the functioning of the Administration of the Generalitat of Catalonia and its agencies "". The objective of the Government's action is ""to take the necessary actions to ensure that the Administration and the Generalitat as a whole restore and act in accordance with the current constitutional and legal order, ensuring institutional neutrality.""

&gt;Faced with the possibility that Puigdemont or his advisers are reluctant to leave their positions, the Executive has warned that they may incur a crime of usurpation of functions, whose regulation is expressly stated in the Penal Code. Government sources emphasize their willingness to act ""with prudence and proportionality"", arguing that any resistance by the deprived authorities can be overcome by the passage of time, without any intervention. The concern of La Moncloa is at the moment in the reaction that can be to the measures in the streets, and in that does not take place any type of violent act.

&gt;**Competence in media**

&gt;According to the decree published in the BOE, Rajoy maintains the competencies referred to ""the scope of the functions of the General Secretariat of Communication of the Government and the Media.""

&gt;Among the powers that pass to the central government, the control of the General Directorate for Financial Policy, Insurance and Treasury, the Heritage and Tributes and Games, which will be assumed by the Ministry of Finance and Public Administration, headed by Minister Cristóbal, stands out. Montoro. This, in addition, will also have management capacity over areas of CTTI and CESICAT, whose general functions lie in Sáenz de Santamaría.

&gt;Presidency and Territorial Administrations, the department that commands the vice president, will also have among its responsibilities the official bulletin of the Autonomous Community and the opinion studies center.

&gt;For its part, Fomento, headed by Íñigo de la Serna, will take charge of the main Catalan infrastructures, such as ports, airports and the railway service of the Generalitat.

&gt;Interior, directed by Juan Ignacio Zoido, assumes the direction of the regional police and the organization of the electoral processes, which includes the regional elections called for December 21.

&gt;**Regional elections**

&gt;The government hopes for a short-term intervention, and has called for regional elections on December 21 with the aim of extending its action for a short period of time. The BOE includes the dissolution of the Parliament of Catalonia, elected on December 27, 2015, and that electoral convocation, as well as the details of its organization. The electoral districts of Barcelona, ​​Girona, Lleida and Tarragona will elect, respectively, 85, 17, 15 and 18 regional deputies. Likewise, it is stipulated that the electoral campaign will last 15 days from December 5, 2017 at 00.00 (local time) and until the 19th day of that same month.

&gt;The independence parties have not yet clarified whether they will participate in the elections after the dismissal of the Government and the approval by the Senate of the measures requested by the Government under Article 155 of the Constitution.

&gt;SCHOLARS, OFFICIALS ON PRACTICES AND SUPPLIED BODIES

&gt;Government decrees add a new body suppressed to those already announced by President Mariano Rajoy after the extraordinary Council of Ministers Friday. Thus, the special commission on the violation of fundamental rights in Catalonia is also extinguished, which joins in its closure to the Catalan embassies; to Diplocat; or the National Transition Advisory Council.

3520,"&gt; You bring up the right to self determination, but conveniently ignore national borders and sovereignty and the right to defend it.

You literally live in a country that unilaterally declared independence in 1830. What about national borders of Netherlands? Or do you think Belgium should still be part of Netherlands?

And the same goes for most European countries. And I'm guessing not all the citizens of each country that fought for independence wanted their country to become independent. 

Democracy doesn't mean **everyone** has to be 100% satisfied. Only majority. With the caveat that majority should not do harm to minority. When majority votes for a president or party you don't like, you still have to respect it even though you don't like it.

In this particular case with Catalonia, referendum was far from perfect (but largely fault of Spain).

Each state within the Indian Union has their own upper and lower house, if they are large enough, and a combined parliament for the smaller ones. Each state has population-based state representatives that sit in the upper house of the central govt and a termly elected lower house through national elections. And state have their elections, govts, cabinets in the exact same way the central govt does and enjoy great autonomy vis-a-vis the central govt.

3543,"&gt;Why would anyone want to be ruled from Madrid, London or Warsaw in this situation?

Little known fact: Catalonia elects representatives to the Spanish parliament and plays a role in that ""rule from Madrid"" you're talking about.

Also, if Catalonia secedes, Girona will be ""ruled from Barcelona"" in the exact same way that Barcelona is ""ruled from Madrid."" Same arrangement.

&gt;Why should money pass through their pockets before coming back into ours? 

If Catalonia secedes, I promise you that money from Tarragona will pass through the Catalonian government before coming back to Tarragona. Does that justify Tarragona seceding and declaring itself a Monacoesque city-state?

&gt;This is fundamentally a movement for greater autonomy.

So is the guy who tries to declare that his rural farm is its own sovereign micro-state. So were the declarations of secession by the Confederate states in 1860. A movement for greater autonomy from a fair, free, and democratic state isn't inherently a good thing. In many cases it's a pretty bad thing.

&gt;The territorial integrity of the Spanish State is really not that important except to those in power.

I'd wager that public opinion polling in Spain wouldn't agree with that statement right now. I'd also wager that the territorial integrity of the Spanish state is quite important to the *millions* of Catalans who don't favor secession.

&gt;To say so simply to parrot the corporate line. We mustn't disrupt capitalism, it will be inconvenient for the rich!

Disrupt capitalism, my Catalan friends! As a democracy, Spain gives you the tools to do so. You need to persuade your fellow citizens, and work hard to win elections. It's not easy, but it's feasible. Virulent nationalism has seldom been a friend to the poor though, and the idea that it is here seems dubious. 

&gt;However, the results of the referendum show that these people are a minority

By Michael Le Page

The widely used weedkiller glyphosate is available in every garden store, but now there are fears it can cause cancer.

Politicians in Europe were sufficiently alarmed that the European parliament called for a ban. The final decision rests with members states, who have delayed until November the vote on renewing the licence to use glyphosate because of a lack of consensus.

Let’s hope they use that time to look at the evidence – or rather the lack of it. While banning glyphosate is unlikely to make people any healthier, it is certain to harm the environment. Can the politicians who have fallen for the line of the anti-glyphosate activists be swayed with facts?

First, let’s examine the calls for banning it. Until recently, every regulatory agency that had assessed the safety of glyphosate had concluded it poses no risk for people. Then, in 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) sparked concern by adding glyphosate to its list of things that “probably” cause cancers.

Before you run from the room screaming because you once ate some Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream – recently found to contain glyphosate – you should know that red meat, wood fires, emissions from frying, shift work and drinking beverages hotter than 65°C are all on the same IARC list.

The IARC’s list of things that definitely cause cancers includes alcohol, sunshine, diesel exhaust fumes, processed meats, outdoor air pollution, salted fish, soot and wood dust. That’s right, beer and bacon are more dangerous than glyphosate.

Much recent media coverage features uncritical interviews with the families of farmers who claim they got a cancer called non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma because of their exposure to glyphosate. But as heart-wrenching as these cases may be, they prove nothing.

“The epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or other cancers,” says John Acquavella at Aarhus University, Denmark, who reviewed all the evidence after the IARC listing.

Indeed, many researchers think the IARC got it wrong. The facts just don’t back the cancer claims: while glyphosate use surged in the US after the introduction of GM crops in the 1990s, for instance, the incidence of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma has actually declined slightly since 2000.

Environmental benefits

So the evidence that glyphosate is harming our health is weak or non-existent. But it certainly has environmental benefits. It is now widely used around the world as part of “no till” farming. Instead of ploughing fields to get rid of weeds, glyphosate is used to kill them. Not ploughing improves soils, reduces erosion and lowers carbon emissions from soils.

If farmers can’t use glyphosate, they will either switch to more toxic – and more expensive – alternative herbicides, or resume ploughing. That means more damage to soils and wildlife, higher carbon emissions and higher food prices.

So while it might seem as if banning glyphosate is a great idea, it’s not that simple – just as organic farming turns out to be worse for the environment despite everyone assuming it’s better. The European Union should not ban it without good reason.

All this said, there is one problem with the continued use of glyphosate: evolution. Weeds are evolving resistance, meaning farmers have to use more of the herbicide or switch to the more toxic alternatives. If we don’t use glyphosate wisely, everyone will have to stop using it eventually, ban or no ban.

The sensible way forward would be to impose stricter conditions on glyphosate use to limit the evolution of resistance. For instance, glyphosate is commonly sprayed on crops just before harvesting to kill them and dry them out. Some countries in Europe already limit this use of glyphosate as a drying agent.

There's no clarification what happens when a state splits.

The conflict is far more one-sided than most US media reports with far more transgressions from Israel.

A UN report is available here:

[UN Report - Israeli Practices towards the Palestinian People and the Question of Apartheid](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4dBqK3Z51-BeHJVRXVoSWRfZHc)

&gt; This report concludes that Israel has established an apartheid regime that
&gt; dominates the Palestinian people as a whole. Aware of the seriousness
&gt; of this allegation, the authors of the report conclude that available evidence
&gt; establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Israel is guilty of policies and
&gt; practices that constitute the crime of apartheid as legally defined in
&gt; instruments of international law.

This report was suppressed shortly after publication through pressure from Israel and USA, shameful of both the USA and the UN to go along with the act.

And what an example for other regions and the people of Spain in general, if the government doesn't step up to stand for its people and law.

there are few conditions. 

first one, is Us (Good guys) benefiting from their independence.

If Catalan independence is about the economy, then the federalists have a weapon to bludgeon them over the head with.

If the economy is a factor, but the main reasons are things like cultural identity, linguistic sovereignty, local governmental control?

Then you can't do anything about that if you're Spain. You have to change the conversation to the economy.

Here in Quebec, people care about the economy and taxes. But the only people you ever hear making the ""economy"" and ""Quebec would be bankrupt without the rest of Canada"" are...

are...

You guess it. English-speaking federalists. They either don't understand or don't want to understand the simple fact that the sovereignty movement would rather be bankrupt and poor to be free than to be dependent and and have ""stuff"". I liken it to paying your spouse money to stay in a marriage they want out of. Even though both parties will be worse off in a divorce having duplication of costs and no more shared economics, if you're unhappy in the relationship and it can't be solved, then what?

Really, your understanding should be that whenever you hear ""economics"" or ""financial ruin"" mentioned, it is invariably from the anti-sovereignty federalists and it's a lie of omission.

""I don’t have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It’s a depression. Everybody’s out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel’s worth. Banks are going bust. Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there’s nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there’s no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that’s the way it’s supposed to be.



We know things are bad – worse than bad. They’re crazy. It’s like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don’t go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is: ‘Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won’t say anything. Just leave us alone.’

Well, I’m not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get MAD! I don’t want you to protest. I don’t want you to riot – I don’t want you to write to your congressman, because I wouldn’t know what to tell you to write. I don’t know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad. (shouting) You’ve got to say: ‘I’m a human being, god-dammit! My life has value!’

So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell: ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’

I want you to get up right now. Sit up. Go to your windows. Open them and stick your head out and yell – ‘I’m as mad as hell and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’ Things have got to change. But first, you’ve gotta get mad!…You’ve got to say, ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’ Then we’ll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first, get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it: ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’

3945,"&gt; I defend the Ag industry. I also defend animal production and other Ag issues, but since Reddit is full of such amazing bullshitters who lie for Karma, the majority of the time it’s arguments about Monsanto.

We've disagreed a lot over the last hour or so. Are you calling me a bullshitter who lies for karma?!

&gt; There is an effort by clickbait websites to spam Reddit with activist articles to sell products of the woo woo variety.

This article is sourced from a news organisation. Your argument would work against literally any piece of news that turned up on multiple sites. It's not a valid criticism of the news itself, and the petition of 1.3 million people is real.

&gt; Natural News knows that a Monsanto link on Reddit will get them tens of thousands of hits. They see this and write more articles based on bullshit.

Is this a Natural News article? It really doesn't seem that way to me. This is like criticising apples because lemons are sour.

&gt; If you worked in the manufacturing business and groups repeatedly claimed that Keyboard Spacebars are giving people thumb cancer, and you know that the source of this claim is The Onion, wouldn’t you try to let people know they are idiots on Reddit?

Well the source of the cancer claim is none other than the World Health Organisation and their International Agency for Research on Cancer. If you're anything like other Monsanto supporting reddit accounts, you'll start rubbishing them now I pointed out it was a reputable source. Monsanto supporters tactics: 1. pretend it's some satire or clickbait site making stuff up 2. if people know the truth, discredit the real source by any means necessary.

3947,"I really shouldn´t answer, but hell, I need to.

Really? It fucked you the most? How? While our people fled your´s moved in. They did nothing to stop this. By the end you more so fought alongside them than against them.

And your theory of Albanians always being the majority on Kosovo and the Ottoman empire this giving them the Vilyaet is somehow true? It´s a fact that we were the majority until the 19th century, and that many people fled from Kosovo during the migrations.

The entire Dardania thing is a fairy tale though...

Miloš Obilić is mentioned in the correspondanse between Tvrtko and his Italian allies as the man who killed Murad. I´d say that´s enough proof. The myth of Kosovo was not made by any single family but by the people, a single family, even the ruling one, could not shape the mindset of every single person in the country. Kosovo became myth thanks to the people, and it´s this myth that helped us keep our national identity during the Ottoman times. I´d say that´s as important as it´s historical value. Also, if the goal was to make every Serb out to be a hulk then branding Kosovo the biggest defeat in our history is a poor way of doing it. Realistically it was a draw, and Tvrtko mentions a Christian victory. There was ample room to spread the idea of it being on, but that wasn´t the case. The point of the folklore wasn´t strength or power, but martyrdom. 

So, yes, most does come of folklore, but the battle is still important. Even with a ˝win˝ it took the Turks another 70 years to conquer us. Had we won we may have been able to push them back. And so what if we lost the war? You too lost, does that mean you should throw Skanderbeg into the trash can? No.

Oh, so you meant the 20th century, I though you meant medieval times. Sorry. But again, considering Kosovo was Serbian before the Ottomans it can´t be called a colony, though there certainly were plans to bring in Serbian settlers now that you moved in, which can be called recollonazation, so you are correct here.

The first mention I found of the city was during the 2 century AD, Roman times. So I wouldn´t call it Dardanian. Belgrade was a Celtic city at first.

Metohija is not a new term, in fact it was abolished during the time of communism, cause of the church association of it´s name, meaning monastic lands. Considering how many monasteries are there it´s safe to say it´s an old name. Didn´t know you declared it as such, by again, why use our name?

Serbia too was left in ruins thanks to NATO, seems to be doing much better, despite equally turbulent times in the early 2000s. 

The ICTY does what NATO tells it to. I´m not some crazy that thinks they just hate us, they don´t give two shits, they, like all great powers, care about their interests. Interests like seeing Yugoslavia fall apart, or having a giant base on Kosovo. Interest we were against while you were OK with, so they supported you. There is no love in geopolitics, or right or wrong. If Yugoslavia was part of NATO and loyal to they would have bombed you. 

Sorry, but your war wasn´t clean. I have no problem admitting our crimes against you, but I expect the same from your side. The KLA was considered a terrorist group by everyone, even NATO before they saw its usefulness. You too killed people, burnt churches, drove people out, and funded yourself on organ harvest and drug trade. This is my problem with you people, you think yourselves angels and us demons, you think black and white, and yes, many people Serbia do so too, and I can´t stand that.

NATO is stronger than facts. It was a fact that Iraq had no WMD, that didn´t stop them, it´s a fact that Libya had the highest living standard in Africa and that they created those rebels, didn´t stop them, facts aren´t stopping them in Syria either, Russia is.

3971,"&gt; As an independence supporter one of our biggest headaches at the time was EU membership. The anti-independence side used that as one of their main arguments, that Scotland may not be able to retain EU membership and if it did then it would have to reapply through a difficult and lengthy process.

I remember that. And I was a little bit in shock that the fearmongering of some unionists might have worked and done enough to convince the Scots to vote against independence. Don't get me wrong, I have no particular preference when it comes to the status of Scotland. If anything would prefer it if the different unions between our people and nations would remain intact, and within that I would prefer it if Scotland would remain in the EU. What I want is that people make their decisions for the right reasons, and that made it so hard to watch the indyref from the outside and how the Scots seemingly fell for the lies of the unionists and that bullshit about ""remain in the UK and you will remain in the EU"" (yeah, that turned out well) while the EU itself was forced to stand aside and couldn't do anything to rectify that fearmongering. If I remember correctly then Salmond also ran a very weak campaign that has left many crucial questions unanswered, so it was just not the fearmongering from the unionists that has driven the outcome of the referendum.

Anyway, what you should also remember is that when the indyref was brought up again after the Brexit referendum, many people in Brussels talked very openly about solutions to keep Scotland in the EU if they should become independent. And the stance of many European governments changed from reservation to neutral or even cautious by open support. If you should be given the chance to vote about your independence again, remember what I said about the EU: It's in their nature to bring the people, not to drive them apart. They will be more than willing to welcome Scotland back and make it easy for them to claim their place at the table again.

No, BBC is not a balanced news station. Sorry. Only someone voting close to Corbyn can claim that. They showed a 10 min ""advertisement"" from Bergdorf saying white people are inherently racist (Most in western Europe would agree that is not balanced. All race hatred should be banned from balanced sources).

They also had internship/job applications where white were not welcome, and defended it with ""equity is important"". Now, that is not unbalanced per se, but the idea of equitism is. In a country based on equality, even more so.

They also keep proclaiming the wage gap, until, of course, it turns out they themselves have a wage gap, in which case it's due to ""performance"".

I acknowledge I come off as a very ""white malish"" type of guy, but if we just ignore the sex and race for one second, if possible, it must be seen as a very leftist idea to base things like this on those merits.

If an institution use these method within recruiting, and also are capable of showing purely racist clips, I don't see any doubts that they can be seen as left leaning. Unless you can give me evidence they have done the same thing for the opposing side.

If a government charges a hungry person for stealing food, the legality of theft is immaterial, it has failed as a government. This is not similar in how dire the situation is, but is parallel in overall effect. 

So the Spanish government cannot be uncritically supported. Something has to change, the constitution, its interpretation, or the current government And not admitting the need for that change and continuing on the current vector will see the violence, force, and subversion of the European order.

What, to patent a cultivar you developed via selective breeding?  Sure, every agricultural science company does that.  It's how you get funding to do the work:

* Borrow funds from investors.

* Pay researchers to develop a useful new plant or animal variant.

* Company that researchers work at obtain a patent.  This grants them a twenty year monopoly over creating instances of the thing, at which point it enters the public domain.

* The company sells the seeds with royalties for the right to grow the plants and sells them to agricultural companies.  Assuming that the improvement is worth the extra cost to them, farmers will use it.  If not, they won't.

* End users pay a higher price for their goods if they choose the output of the farmers who use it.

&gt; However it is average at best. 

So fucking what. I don't expect them to be genius or anything. The majority know how to speak Spanish without any problem whatsoever.

-Big businesses will leave 
-Economy will go to shit
-Country done goof
-Nobody outside of Spain wants this

I've been to Barcelona several times and love the city, and have gotten to know plenty of people there. Their views were mixed but as of recent, a lot of them have swayed over to independency.

For Catalonia's economy to survive, it wouldn't be much of an issue, I don't think.

-The city is a massive tourism hotspot which won't seriously be effected. Sure, they will see a small hit, but whilst airlines like Jet2, Ryanair and Easyjet offer cheap as hell returns, that's one industry that won't go under.
-They could declare their tax at a subsidised rate making it attractive for businesses to move to and or stick around.
-There's plenty of potential of finance at the ports and docks, they could capitalise on investment there.
-Per head of population, Catalonia currently produces more than a 1 for 1 on the population vs GDP. There's already value to be had, when they go independent, it might not be as much, but it's still going to be plenty. They're a large economy, to suggest businesses are just going to up and leave and not go is stupid.

Destroying the ""moral of the population"" was a tactic used by the British airforce in all openess. They didn't ""only attack the industry"". Civilians weren't just Ccllateral damage, they were an active target - especially during the end of the war. This is what Churchill later said on the topic: 

&gt;It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed.

If you look at the most ancient civilisation still alive (Arabic, Chinese and Indian), who created agriculture, writing, city, state, the moment they created the patrilineal system, they started to stagnate as a civilisation. This lowering of the status of women sterilizes the creativity of these societies, since it must be admitted that the educational potential of children is reduced when mothers are infantilized. But even theoretically dominant men are partly children in a patrilineal anti-individualist system. The patrilineal principle, then its accentuation, paralyzes these societies little by little.

4261,"The first point is a resounding yes. Catalonia's economy is not that much stronger; they are not even #1, nor are they the biggest tax contributor; what's more, their economy is nothing more than a concentration of the wealth of the country as a whole, it concentrated in Barcelona as much as it concentrated in Madrid, meaning: their biggest export partner is the rest of Spain; they export more to Aragón (another autonomy) than to the whole of France.
So yeah, wealth is going to slowly start concentrating elsewhere; does this weaken the independentist movement? most likely no, since it's based on populism and demagogy, they will blame this new economic fiasco on Spain, and people will choose to believe that. 

This indeed doesn't end well; there is no doubt now that the nationalist end goal is actual independence (rather than aspirational, which is what they have used to bargain unbelievable self-govern terms for 40 years). This means rising support for centralism in the rest of Spain, (which incidentally will hurt other regionalistic parties) which will provide a clear mandate to the Spanish government to **suppress** any secesionistic aspirations.

To me, they have shot themselves in the foot. They were one of the most autonomous regions in the EU, on par with German länder, but this collective hallucination will have terrible consecuences for catalans first and foremost. Let's hope they realize the current government in Spain has been restraining itself, and they back off. If they don't, there's going to be elections in Spain, and the mandate will be clear.

1. Catalonia has 7,5 million people. So, unless you live in Moscow (8mil) or London (7mil), your city is hardly comparable.

2. Don't know if you heard, but there's [approx. 28 counties in Europe with less population than Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population#Table). 

Some of them are even current members of EU.

3. And, if your local city is larger than 451 people (population of Vatican City), than I guess the answer to your idiotic question is **yes**.

You were being lied to. A majority do want independence. When they said

&gt; Ok remember we're talking about one third of the Catalan population here.

They were lying. 38% of Catalans votes **were counted** for secession in the supressed referendum. This is already closer to a majority than you were just told (""one third of the Catalan population""). As well as this, another 14.5% of the votes were lost or prevented at the door of the polling station https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_referendum,_2017#Resultsindependence - which would have probably brought the amount of Catalans that voted for independence to about 52%.

Or, they could have no had one at all. The referendum was irrelevant.

Not at all. The only coercion involved is purely commercial. Catalonians don't want to renounce their citizenship and *leave* because they want all their shit exactly the way it is except without any obligation to anyone else. 

That's illegal and a blatant dismissal of the agreement they made in 1978 and every single waking moment since then. If they don't want to be a part of the system, either they need to get everyone on board with changing the system, or they can **leave**. That's it.

4487,"&gt;They should've passed a law that had support from at least the major 3 blocs so there isn't a possibility of next legislature they change the law again fostering a even more instable political system.

Fact is that M5S nearly always refuses to colloborate with other parties and the few times they do they are very unreliable and usually end up changing idea mid way no matter what is discussed. Multiple times , first Bersani(the then secretary of the PD) then Renzi tried to enter talk with them to either form a government or pass an electoral law or things like that and it never worked. The amount of plural support for this law is already quite high for the standard of italian politics and there was not much time to work with since there were only a few months to work with since the constituional axed half of the previous law at the beginning of 2017.
This is the best comprimise we've got, it's not the best or ideal but there isn't really realistic alternative at this point in the legislature and with this political climate.

&gt;That's up to the party system to decide, now changing the playing field so it helps opportunistically the bigger parties that's my point.

But it dosen't necessarily opportunistically help the bigger parties since they have to rely on smaller parties to form coalitions which end up giving the smaller parties more influence(with the current numbers for example a Renzi-Berlusconi grand coalition in a new parliament would probably not have the numbers alone to govern without the support of some smaller right or left wing party. Also this means that smaller parties can band togheter before the election to form electoral blocs which have a better chanche at having influence in parliament provided they can get at least to 10%(if they run individualy they isntead need 3% to enter parliament).

This means that several 2% parties coming from a similar politcal origin(left-right etc.etc.) can theoretically band togheter and enter parliament if they pass 10% instead of being all left out if there were no coalitions allowed.

&gt;Listening to smaller parties and active political scientists (Pasquino has been vocal on this) could've improved the law immensely.

Pasquino also wrote about the need to discharge this absurd ideas about Coalition government being inerently bad that we have in Italy(especially coming from sides like M5S but also from parts of PD and of the right) when he say that they can actually be more representative of the choices of the electorate that many majoritarians form of governments and provide more moderates government while keeping the extremes at bay. 

So this kind of throws out of the window all the M5S whining about alliances and coalitions either before or after the elections being unfair no matter what and all the whining about ""Inciucio""(If you are somewhat informed about Italian politics and you seem to be you already know what it means so it dosen't need explanation).

One of his big beefs with the law(at least from what I've heard by him on TVs channels like la7) which I think is quite justifiable it's the absence of preferences and I actually agree with him on this one. It's a huge flaw of the law in my opinion but others could also argue that preferences can especially in the south lead to buying votes, mafia infiltrations in politics and corruption. 

To be fair those things can still happen anyway without preferences but quite a number of people argue that preferences would make the matter worse.I think that they are worth the risk since they leave more choice to the electorate on who they want representing them but there are many that disagree.

To me the best system would be a system like the Mattarellum that we had in the 90s. Small single-member constituency were candidates battle each other and who win can be said to represent adequately that small constituncies voters while still providing more stability than a purely proportional systeam and more easy to obtain mayorities. 

I mean it would still not solve the situation completely since you would still need coalitions to form in a tripolar system so divided even on a territorial basis (North-Right,Centre-Left,Sud-M5S) and parties should need to compromise but that's not inherently a bad things like we seems to think here in Italy.

The other alternative to have some stability(which is really what Italy needs) would be to revamp the entire Republic into a presidential system inspired by France but that would need a massive constitutional reform and I don't think if anybody wants to do that at this point or if the electorate even want it since it's not a really representative system especially in a tripolar situation.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/7913b1/italian_senate_approves_electoral_law_likely_to/doys7pe/,un_Fiorentino,1509113341

For me (i've graduated with a thesis on the electoral system in Europe) the solution will be a proportional with small constituency or a system like German's, where the deputies are elected with a personalisation of the vote, that can create a way to improve the quality of our political class.

Like Sartori said: the electoral system can't create a majority if the people don't want...and the people don't want, the *esprit* of politics in Italy is the enemy, the division...and with that you can't create a stable majority without distort a lot the popular want (like with Calderoli's law, we had an enormous Gallagher Index!).",Italy,/r/europe/comments/7913b1/italian_senate_approves_electoral_law_likely_to/doyjxk2/,LanciaStratos93,1509099040

I pay 0 through my employer.

&gt;Additionally, going to the doctor always requires a long wait in the waiting room and a mountain of paperwork.

Not always, and a two page questionnaire is not a mountain of paperwork.

&gt;I have an insurance policy through a major provider here that costs me 32€ per month. 

0 through my employer and if i had a wife/kids they would be covered too, free!

&gt;Here, if you make an appointment at 11:00, your appointment is at 11:00, or no more than a few minutes later.

&gt; I think to myself “surely I’m going to receive a large bill in the mail any day now,”

Never received a large bill in my life.

&gt; because it is just astounding, from an American point of view, that I can receive the care, especially in such a convenient manner, for such a low price. And prescriptions – I have one I fill semi-regularly here and it costs me 1/11 of what I paid in a US pharmacy. That is INSANE.

TBF this was historically the most humane killing method for most animals, however modern slaughterhouses tend to [stun the animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunning) using either a captive bolt or or electricity to render them insensate before killing, this is intended as a [more human slaughter method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Slaughter_Act) to limit animal suffering.

4791,"One person (often the last speaker) in the context of Australian languages is enough for me for me to pay attention.

It is sufficient, not just for me, but the linguists in my department of linguistics who work with languages that have less than 300 speakers.

The fact that they are a MINORITY is precisely the point. Even when they were a MAJORITY, their wishes were ignored. When the majority of France did not speak French, they were overruled by an extreme minority who pushed their language on to them.

One does not 'waste' resources. Are you one of those people who think it is a waste for the government to fund cinema and art? To fund environmental agencies who look after the mountains, the rivers and the rainforests? 

About usefulness, again the French government ignored the other languages when they were far more useful than French! 

To a Warlpiri speaker, the usefulness of their language is obvious: with their family and their community. Within that circle, a language that only has 3000 or so speakers is more useful than English. Who would they speak English to in  Yuendumu? 

To an Alasacien speaker, knowing Alsatien might be useful when it comes to learning another Germanic language, like standard German (which is, as far as I know, also taught in Alsatien immersion schools). In fact, there's a French redditor who regrets that his father didn't teach him Alsatien and now lives in Germany. Knowing Alsatien would have significantly helped him learn German. 

Or what about Occitan? Occitan is mutually intelligble with Catalan, one of the driving economic powerhouses of Spain, and just across the border.

For example French exist because the Latin dialect continuum collapsed, Latin existed because the Proto-Italic dialect continuum collapsed and so on.

4830,"Pretty much yeah. What bugs me about summer time is that once the sun is starting to set later and later, we switch the time so the sun sets an extra hour later. I don't find a use for sunshine at 22:00, and small children get very sleepy at 8 already and don't want to sleep because it's still bright outside, but we still need to wake up at 6:30 to go to work and kindergarden, with longer daylight, it just takes the body longer to start getting sleepy naturally.

And once the sun starts setting earlier and earlier, we switch the clock to winter time so instead of having 1 hour of sun after work (so until like 5 ish) I will now leave work in the dark. So I'll arrive in dark, leave in dark, meanwhile theres too much sun in the summer.

It would make sense to me to do quite the opposite as it is now, so the winter (CET) would be used in the summer, and instead of CEST=CET+1 we should have CEWT=CET-1 in winter. We would still have sun until 9pm in the summer, but then in the winter we could enjoy an extra hour of sunlight until like 18:00 instead of 16:00 for example.

Any electricity savings that may have happened in last millenium when summer time was introduces are out weight by increase in AC usage in the summer evenings, and most lights are LED now anyway which use only a fraction of power of the lights in 1900s.

TL;DR: current system with CEST makes the winters too dark and summers too bright. It should be the other way around. Electricity savings are non-existent because of AC usage in the summer.",,/r/europe/comments/78wma3/finland_wants_eu_to_give_up_daylight_saving_time/doyecu2/,widowhanzo,1509085244

That is not the Spanish model, it's just what Spain copied off of other countries but made it worse

&gt;In the end, the constitution found a balance in recognizing the existence of nationalities and regions in Spain within a bigger nation.

Oh yeah right it's so balanced that the Catalans don't accept it anymore, pretty much. Much balance, very wow

&gt; The drafters of the current Spanish constitution avoided giving labels such as “federal” to the territorial arrangements,

Who cares? That's just meaningless naming anyway.

&gt; while enshrining in the constitution the right to autonomy or self-government of the nationalities and regions

Again, counterexample Catalonia

&gt; the ""autonomous communities"" that were to be created.

Except that in Spain not all communities are autonomous equally.

They lived around the city of Phtia. Another possible root for the word Ελλάς and Έλλην, Greece and Greek, is the word Ελλοψ which means mute.

Until now the social contributions were split between the employer and the employee . They amounted to 39,5% which was split between the employee (16,5%) and employer (23%). Starting 2018 , all contributions will be payed by the employee (they were reduced to 35%) with the employer paying nothing but a ""solidarity tax"" (they renamed it recently ) of 2,25%. There was also a reduction of a tax. So , in order for the salaries not the decreased ( the employee had to now pay 35% instead of 16,5% so the salaries would have clearly decreased) they increased the gross minimum.

5033,"I'm a bit too late, but still feel that I have something to say.

This map reflects regional differences very well, better than the federal districts system and maybe even better than [economic regions of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_regions_of_Russia) (these regions were outlined back in the Soviet era and are almost forgotten by now, but I'd say they describe geographic divisions of Russia pretty well; and most of them are very similar to these macroregions).

Russians never say ""Deep South"", though; this region is usually called just ""South"" (or ""Southern Russia""), and I don't see any reasons to call it ""Deep South"" given that there are no other ""Souths"" except North Caucasus, which is even ""deeper"" (well, maybe also Chernozemye sometimes referred to as part of the South, but rarely). And I can't remind ""Amur"" being used as a name of any part of Russia besides Amur oblast. ""Amur"" and ""Far North-East"" (this name is almost never used too) are almost always perceived as the same region called Far East.

Besides merging Amur and Far North-East, I think Adygea should be moved from North Caucasus to Southern Russia.

Some other possible changes (though less obvious, and I wouldn't agree with many of them):
* Merge North-West and North;
* Merge Central Russia and Chernozemye;
* Merge Western and Eastern Siberia (duh);
* Volgograd and Astrakhan oblasts to Volga region;
* Udmurtia to Ural;
* Kurgan oblast to Western Siberia;
* Sakha-Yakutia to Eastern Siberia.

Some even more dubious changes (though some people would agree with them):
* Merge South with North Caucasus;
* Merge Volga with Ural;
* Oryol oblast to Central Russia;
* Bashkortostan, Perm krai and Orenburg oblast to Volga;
* Tyumen oblast (with Khanty-Mansi and Yamal-Nenets okrugs) to Ural.

Some other parts of the country are too small to form macroregions of their own (although demographically Far North-East is also too small, it has roughly as many people as Kaliningrad oblast, which is one of the reasons I think it shouldn't be separated from the rest of the Far East), but don't fit any of these macroregions well:
* Kaliningrad oblast, due to geographical and historical reasons;
* Kalmykia and Tuva, due to cultural reasons.

Finally, Crimea, if we consider it part of Russia, would be in Southern Russia.",,/r/europe/comments/78pyqf/cultural_macroregions_of_russia_explanation_in/doy65j8/,a_a_t,1509072080

5041,"You'll find a lot of criticism of our time zone if you talk to people here. Here are a couple major reasons:  
1) Being out of sync with the sun is unhealthy and really takes a toll on you (and can make you exhausted). People here have to wake up far earlier (in solar time) than their counterparts in Germany, etc. Combine this with going to sleep late (due to wanting to stay up a few hours after the sun sets to relax, especially in summer when it's hot when the sun is in the sky) and as a result, Spain is I think the country in Europe that sleeps the least. So not only are we waking up too early in solar time, but we're also getting far too little sleep. It's a recipe for making the whole country perpetually tired, grumpy, and inefficient. Also there are tangible health benefits (even significant reductions in rates of some important diseases) to syncing up with solar time as our bodies actually rely a fair bit on natural sunlight to schedule itself. Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm  
2) It makes more sense to have a clock that is true to nature and to move around our behaviours to match it, rather than to pick times to match what Germans (originally intended for this when we switched) are doing at that same time and offset ourselves from solar time to make it work. Let noon on our clocks be solar noon, and it will encourage individuals and businesses to better match the solar day which brings a number of benefits. It can get messy if we try to unite all Europe in one time zone (which again was the original intent of Spain switching to CET) as then the time on the clock will mean little to someone travelling to a new place as people's schedules will not match with what they expect. To clarify: have you ever seen a German come to Spain and comment on how everyone seems to stay up very late and it meals at strange hours? We actually don't eat much later than they do on solar time, but it seems like Spaniards do everything very late because our schedules more closely match solar time than the time on our clocks. It's just a little more sensible to have a German who eats a little before 7 go to Galicia and find that they eat a little after 7 rather than find that they eat past 10 at night! Our times would match if only we switched back to using solar time instead of a fictitious invention to match German time when they are located so far east of us.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/78wma3/finland_wants_eu_to_give_up_daylight_saving_time/doy6k0v/,AidenTai,1509072574

5211,"I think the issue will be different. Crows are pretty smart, I wouldn't be surprised if they figure out how to mess with the machine. Another issue how big the reward would be and what this will do for the long time population level in NL. 

If we look at the numbers the crowded cities people say that we litter 6 billion cigarette filters every year and that they decompose in about twelve years. We run a pretty organized country, but I see the filters everywhere, so let's assume that humans eventually clean up half of those, that means we have 3 billion filters left. Now let's think how big the minimum parcel of crow food should be to be useful for the crow. I'd guess that anything much less than 5% of their daily energy needs is not interesting to the crows. That's twenty filters a day per crow, or about 7 000 per crow per year. That comes down to around 430 000 extra crows that could be fed in this manner if we want them to pick up half of those littered filters. Right now there are about 100 000 breeding pairs of crows in the Netherlands, or to put it in other words, if they roll this out nation wide, they would be supporting a tripling of the crow population. Would that be less bad than finding those filters everywhere? I would tend to think so, but then I don't like litter and I do like crows.

And I get that there are all sorts of limitations to this approach of guestimating crow populations, but it does make you think doesn't it? Maybe food isn't the limiting factor on the crow population. Maybe they will stop eating other food cause finding filters is pretty easy. Maybe crows only need extra food in some season and won't need to live of off filter machine food for the whole year. Maybe crows won't collect filters no matter how hard you try to get them to do it. Maybe their filter recognizing machine won't work. But you would need a whole lot of crows to make a dent in the number of littered filters.",Protect the Götterfunken from the Brexit!,/r/europe/comments/78xqhn/dutch_firm_seeks_to_train_crows_to_pick_up/doxsb5b/,WhyYouShouldCare,1509055660

Our tax system is absolute shit and inflexible. Small to medium business owners have to pay usurious amounts of taxes, such as the almighty ZUS,  which they have to pay no matter what with no flexibility as to the amount. Since the costs of running a business are high, the wages stay low. 

Since Ukrainians and other folks from the East can come here to work, employers don't have to raise wages since they can get an equally semi-skilled or skilled worker for cheap since they won't ask for too much money. All they need to do is threaten the Ukrainian or Belarusian worker that they will let them go and the worker will back off. 

Tl;dr the wages won't go up since greed, usurious taxation, and exploitation of foreign workers makes a hefty profit. ",Mazovia (Poland),/r/europe/comments/78x6i0/leaders_of_hungary_and_poland_chafe_at_eu_but_how/doxt44b/,SlyScorpion,1509056606

Having said that, most of the toxic, insulting and downright abusive comments that I have seen here have been made by pro-independence types. I definitely downvote those. Many of those users have been banned from the sub overtime, and I think with good reason. 

Of course there are anti-independence users that are insulting and toxic too (and I downvote those when I see them, even if I agree with their substance), but I have not seen that to nearly the same degree as the reverse.

Northern Italy and Southern Italy (let's say Lombardia and Campania)

Eastern Hungary vs Western Hungary

Eastern Poland vs Western Poland

Transylvania and Moldova (Romanian region not the country).

or even Northern Portugal vs Southern Portugal.

and there is a pattern: the closer a region is to the economic powerhouses of Europe, the less it costs to move things and people around, the more investment comes.

I think that's the biggest difference. Honestly after a day at work I just want a bit of silence. I think most Danes, or Scandinavians, just like silence and being left alone I guess. Just look at us waiting on the bus... or how we act on the bus. Both to and from work or school.

Moving out honestly got me closer to my family. When I lived at home they were kinda just there, and sure, we interacted, but nothing like when I go home to eat dinner now. 

&gt; The rest are my own conclusions. One source might be this book/movie ""lord of flies"" which describes the society evolve when children without any adult have all to say, now I don't say that in kindergarden the workers are not present but unless they are same amount of children there will always be situations that will be out of their perception...

To be fair, children still have a lot of interaction with adults even though they are in day care for some hours of the day. 

Idk... just cultural difference at the end of the day I guess. It just feels natural to move out and never wanting to move back in with your parents. It would feel weird.

5610,"&gt; those who don't know what they are talking about

You keep on repeating that, but you still haven't told us what piece of information would magically make anyone informed side with you.

People don't need to be monolingual in order to have a language in common, you don't need to eliminate regional languages.

You make it sound like everyone just willfully embraced French and decided to lose contact with all the centuries culture and literature associated with their local language because it was convenient, but there was an active effort to make people think they and their kids couldn't have a decent future if they didn't give up their language, and that regional languages were just remnants of past mistakes.

It is true that most people in France nowadays don't care, and again that's because the damage was already done. I have spent the first 20 years of my life in France so I'm pretty confident about saying most people in France do not realise the scale of it, and the fact that until the mid 19th century standard French was only the native language of a minority of French citizens.

Finally, this sub is literally a space where people from various countries discuss issues of other countries. If most people from outside France find it noteworthy maybe it's you who should realise that in most countries things didn't have to go this way, and that what happened in France was widely unnecessary.

Nobody is shaming you, but if you start dismissing it as a detail of history or presenting it as something that was actually necessary then you need to be ready for people disagreeing with you. ",,/r/europe/comments/78to4r/variations_of_france_french_xpost_from_rfrance/dox02r1/,venessian,1509026816

For me it's that none of the arguments hold any water, neither economically, nor socially, nor historically. A lot of it seems to be based more on unfounded hatred of Spain, rather than love of Catalonia. This gets to the point where a lot of the arguments seem ""we're better than you, so we don't have to put up with you"". Many people that I've spoken to about it there in Catalonia seem to think of Spanish people as less cultured, less highbrow. This sort of ""I'm better than you"" nationalism doesn't have a place in modern Europe.  
What I will say is that I think the rest Spain **does** need to look at its relationship with Catalonia, as, if there are a significant number of people who feel disenfranchised, there is a reason, but the solution isn't creating more borders.

&gt; I don't understand why someone would like to live a life alone?

I don't. I live with my girlfriend. But even if I didn't there's no way I'd move back in with my parents unless it's for financial reasons. You aren't really alone. People don't die when you move out. They are still there. I honestly feel closer to my parents after moving out. 

&gt; Who will take care of your baby when both you and your partner go working?

In Denmark you have ~1 year of parental leave split between the parents (usually the mom takes most of it). After that they are at a nursery/daycare (not sure what the correct term is in English) with other kids. 

Here they learn to interact with other children and adults in different ways. To me that's much better than having one grandmother take care of them the whole day. Calling them ""unknown people"" is also pretty misleading and really discredits their work. 

&gt; I don't see any positives from it at all, except sexual freedom, but I am not that horny, and sexual act is a beautiful thing not a disgusting one.

I don't even see why sexual freedom is even a point. I literally don't see any positives, other than financial, to live a home with my parents at this point. Surely they want some freedom too after having raised two kids. 

There's absolutely no way in hell I'd ever want to live with my parents or grandparents now at the age of 25. Moving out was the best thing ever. I still see all of my family all the time since we live in the same town. Living at home now would drive me crazy.

As a kid I wanted my own room. As I got older I wanted my own place to live. I can't even comprehend why people at age 20+ would rather live at home than by themselves unless it's for financial reasons. This whole thread is really weird and it would be for 99% of all Danes under the age of 40.

On one side, there are people acting like you, blaming the french for something that started 8 centuries ago, and spreading lies about how the french government actively eradicated regional languages (in reality, you ""Vergonha"" wiki stuff is good old anglo-saxon propaganda - french, as any official language of the state nation, was simply more advantageous than your regional language. If you wanted do move, to do official stuff or anything like that, it was simpler to speak french. Remember that France has been a very centralized state for a very long time. Attempts to preserve local languages in the world are all quite recent. Losing lanquages is always sad, but you need to stop blaming french people for that. It's a natural process, and it's understandable the french government doesn't want to spend ressources on something that seems so little valuable. Besides, this happened in all state-nations of Europe, and is still happening everywhere. And I think it's still a lot better than advocating for the genocide of all Romani people as I've seen a lot of Bulgarian people do.

And on the other side, there are people like liptonreddit, nationalist nazis who think other languages should be cleaned from France and that I would probably punch in the face if I met them in real life.

I have to agree with the other guy-the only reason it failed was their incompetence.

In the price category of a 3 series, I would say to my family, spend that money on a Volvo. Want that size but spend 10k less? Renault Megane. Solid car all around and also way cheaper, some car from VW stable is also an option.

But the base price of a BMW is so high, that for a platform that has not that much refinement as a baseline, you are already paying out of your nose. An entry BMW is not refined, sluggish slow suspension (like any other brand), engines are not that powerful (like any other brand) and some types are so common, you will never find your car back on a parking lot. For an entry car it is hard to justify that over any other entry car, while keeping 10k in your pocket.

I do agree that BMW will excel if you go to the upper range, but also then I would say, on a race track they will get stiff competition. For the price of a M3 you could get a Alfa Romeo 4C. I would definitely know what car I find sexier.

Secondly. If the MHP splits over this the rest of them will back Erdogan. So nothing will be achieved.

5967,"I was given the choice to move to my mother's old apartment or come and live with her and her new boyfriend in another city when I had recently turned 18. Being a kid who by that time had already had a 5 year long history with smoking weed, skipping classes and obvious issues with depression I chose to live at her old place. It was a bad move.

It didn't take very long before I barely showed up to school at all. I would just stay in the apartment and smoke weed all the time. Eventually I got anxiety because I hadn't been to school in what seemed like forever and yet more anxiety for not going. It was a vicious circle. By the end of 2009 I was expelled because I had over 80% absence.

Fortunately, by that time I was living with a girlfriend who somehow managed to motivate my sorry self to get a job, despite me being extremely nervous about going to interviews. I landed a job at a sticker factory.

By the end of 2012 me and my girlfriend had been separated for about eight months and I somehow managed to hit the wall and suffer a psychosis. I got through it relatively unscathed and didn't loose my job (although everyone on facebook probably considered me a total nut job).

Convinced myself to pick up studying again a year later at a boarding school for young adults. Best choice of my life. Made great friends and finally got those damn grades. I was actually one of the highest scoring students the year I graduated. Me so proud.

I got to wrap this up. Sorry for the long comment.

After graduating my mom had broken up with her boyfriend and had moved back into her (or my?) old apartment. I had no money left so I had to move back in with her. I'm 27 now and it definitely feels awkward when telling people about this. The worst is when my mom has friends over. I feel like a total looser.

So yeah, there's doubtless a great social pressure on young adults to get out and live on their own. For some people that isn't necessarily a good idea just yet though.

If you're a parent with children that are having issues in school and they move out; make sure that you interact and meet with them every so often. My mom just left me in that apartment basically and I was not ready for that kind of freedom.

Finland had it's time and chance to build it's independent hedgehogh position.

Balts were way more vulnerable after Soviet collapse. Joining NATO made sense. Trade with Russia wasn't probably going to be such a big thing for fried relations. The nations didn't have independent build up defense. So umbrella of NATO made sense. Plus it was now or never. Only chance to join was as soon as possible after Soviet collapse. Had time been left for Russian build up Balts would have ended in the current Ukraine situation.

As said all nations are in different positions, which affects the calculations of diplomatic and political actions.

Our plan is to sit on the fence and go 'the person who you don't want to talk to directly said to us to say to you X, what you want us to say in response.'
