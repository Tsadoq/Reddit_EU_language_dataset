AZ themselves have said that they will only deliver 40% of their Q1 target. I mean, what more do you want? That's what started this whole thing.

They agreed to deliver 80M doses by the end of March, and will only deliver 31M. That's a huge failure on their part. And they also failed to inform the EU more than a few days before the approval of their vaccine by the EMA. Such a large drop in production didn't happen in a week.

&gt; [...]

&gt; Really? If nothing is wrong why has production there been slow to get started?

Well, that's the thing. There was really nothing wrong with the contract manufacturer. It was AZ lying and rejecting the blame on them.

Even if everything had gone perfectly in the production plant in Belgium, it would have been far from sufficient to cover that commitment. It was never designed to. It is AZ's fault for not subcontracting more companies to produce its vaccine in the EU. They only have another one in the Netherlands, but it isn't even running yet (it's also AZ's job to help them get on the rails asap). So of course, all of the blame falls on the Belgian production plant (the only one that is actually up and running in the EU), while it was AZ that lacked foresight and didn't care too much to try to achieve their targets for the EU (certainly because of the lack of profits).",Brussels,/r/europe/comments/lgrg1m/eus_von_der_leyen_admits_vaccine_rollout/gmwvf2i/,Pampamiro,1613025732

312,"&gt;I don't really understand what you're saying here - I'm literally just basing this off the polls that I linked. I don't have a particular opinion on the matter, I'm just trying to understand the situation.

Most of the replies regarding the Cyprus dispute come from Turkish and Greek nationals (mostly Turkish simply because of their population is 10x that of Greece and 100x that of Cyprus).  The Cypriot voice is usually drowned out between the infighting between these two. 

&gt;I'm assuming from the way you've put this though that you are Cypriot. Can you tell me what Cypriots actually do want and whether in general they're more in favour of reunification or a two state solution?

It's a complicated question only because Turkey has actively made it so. Both sides of the aisle have wanted to reunify. We were nearly in agreement in 2017 [\(Crans Montana negotiations\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%932017_Cyprus_talks) when negotiations failed.  Every member of the negotiations will give you a different story on why they failed, all blaming each other. 

Furthermore, Turkey has been sending thousands of settlers into Cyprus essentially colonizing it with Turkish nationals. I think we're at the point where the majority of northern Cyprus' population is Turks from Turkey. With that said, these aren't people interested in reunifying the island. The last Turkish Cypriot election has shaken any foundation that remained regarding reuniting the island. Ersin Tatar, the new Turkish Cypriot president has come out totally against reuniting the island and is now demanding a 2-state model. I'm not sure how we, as Cypriots, walk back from this point to find middle ground. My only hope is to wait this chaotic period out until Tatar is voted out, but that means thousands of more settlers inhabiting the island changing the demographics to favor Turkey even more...

 Sorry, that may have been more of a rant than an answer to your question but to directly answer your question, most Turkish and Greek Cypriots would be willing to work on reunifying the island without the external influences wreaking havoc on our island. It just doesn't seem like those foreign forces are willing to let go. 



&gt;And thank for actually answering - the other two replies seem to have not actually read my comments and instead just replied to what they've apparently imagined I've said.

All the problems regarding inevitability, and consequences of having a customs border *somewhere*, were foretold many times. And since a land border on the island of Ireland was categorically ruled out, as it would undermine the Belfast Agreement, *it came down to placing it down the Irish Sea*, the implementation of which, came to be known as the NI Protocol.

While the NI Protocol (through, the now controversial **Art. 16**) does provide for a certain degree of flexibility, it **cannot** be used to punch arbitrary holes in the European Single Market.

I don't think there is a distinct one, as there was a binary referendum on EU membership, with it creating the driver for a ""*constitutional*"" change.

372,"Amsterdam surpassed London as Europe’s largest share trading centre last month as the Netherlands scooped up business lost by the UK since Brexit.

An average €9.2bn shares a day were traded on Euronext Amsterdam and the Dutch arms of CBOE Europe and Turquoise in January, a more than fourfold increase from December. The surge came as volumes in London fell sharply to €8.6bn, dislodging the UK from its historic position as the main hub for the European market, according to data from CBOE Europe.

The shift was prompted by a ban on EU-based financial institutions trading in London because Brussels has not recognised UK exchanges and trading venues as having the same supervisory status as its own.
Without this so-called equivalence to ease cross-border dealing, there was an immediate shift of €6.5bn of deals to the EU when the Brexit transition period concluded at the end of last year. It was around half of the amount of business that London banks and brokers would normally handle.

Analysts and executives say the transfer would not mean thousands of jobs leaving London, while the tax hit would be limited to the effects the move in trading would have on the profits of companies involved, they said. Financial services contributed almost £76bn in tax receipts to the UK Treasury last year.",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/lhdkfa/amsterdam_ousts_london_as_europes_top_share/gmwnu7i/,Joko11,1613020324
373,"“It’s symbolic in that London has lost its status as the home of EU share trading, but it has a chance to carve out its own niche on trading,” said Anish Puaar, a market structure analyst at Rosenblatt Securities in London.

“Fund managers will be more concerned with availability of liquidity and the costs of placing a trade, rather than whether an order is executed in London or Amsterdam,” Puaar added.

Paris and Dublin also had small increases in business last month as trading funnelled through the EU arms of Aquis and Liquidnet respectively, rather than through London.

In response, London has lifted a prohibition on trading of Swiss stocks such as Nestle and Roche, which is currently banned on EU exchanges.

Still, the large move in share trading to Amsterdam makes the city one of the early winners from Brexit. Since the start of the year, Amsterdam has also picked up activity in swaps and sovereign debt markets that would typically have taken place in London before Brexit. CBOE Europe is setting up a derivatives trading business in the Dutch capital in the first half of the year.

US-based Intercontinental Exchange is also planning to move the €1bn a day carbon emissions trading market to the Netherlands, although clearing will remain in London.

EU share trading could return to London as part of discussions between the UK and the bloc on financial services, analysts said. The two sides are keen to finalise a memorandum of understanding in March, although hopes in the City have faded that it will include any provisions on equivalence.

Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia political risk consultancy, said the discussions would focus on the circumstances in which regulators would interact with each other.

“The government isn’t really interested in equivalence because it believes the financial services sector will be better and more effectively regulated by the Treasury and Bank of England than Brussels,” he said.",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/lhdkfa/amsterdam_ousts_london_as_europes_top_share/gmwny5z/,Joko11,1613020394

445,"Born in 1904, she would've had her childhood in the 1910s during WW1. 

She's french, so she's bound to have been very worried during those years about just how far the Germans were going to get. Probably knew several young men who went and died during the war. And as France got more desperate they got older soldiers to fight as well. Maybe a few uncles or even her own father had to go as well. And then just as it was finally coming to an end, the Spanish flu hit, which no doubt killed many she knew as well.

She grew up in the 20s. I bet she has some fond memories of her youth in those days. Maybe saw a couple of Charlie Chaplin movies. And it says she worked as a gouvernante for various families. Basically a private tutor for the kids. 

She was still young during the Great depression, it makes sense if a lot of families could no longer afford her services during that time, which would mean that she would experience the financial struggle of that decade as well. It says something of her spirit and determination that she didn't settle down and get married in a time when that was very much expected of a young woman. Was probably considered quite scandalous that she reached her thirtes and still didn't have a husband or any kids. But she clearly didn't need no man! xD

Then world war 2 hit and once again she would be worried about the German progress, and to her fright her country was actually invaded and occupied by the Germans. To walk around and see German troops patrolling the streets for all those years. It was no doubt a very hard time for her. Though it should be mentioned it was during this time she gained the right to vote, when the french government in exile finally gave women voting rights in 1944. She was 40 at the time. Whatever she experienced, it was directly after the war in 1945 at the age of 41 that she decided to become a nun. She then started working at a hospital in Vichy caring for the sick.

She did this for 31 years. She was 72, when she retired in 1976. 

After 33 years of living in a nursing home in Haute-Savoi she moved to another in Toulon in 2009 at the age of 105, and has lived there for the past 12 years.

It says one of her former students reached out to her in 2019 when she became famous after reaching 115. This student was 91.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/lgwjjw/lucile_randon_a_french_nun_and_the_oldest_living/gmw4yzs/,Tychus_Balrog,1613009959

On 11 January 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament officially recognized the 1989 expulsion as ethnic cleansing.[7] However, some of the country's mainstream parties tend to neglect and disregard this 1989 ethnic cleansing.

By contrast, Italy explicitly commemorates these people as victims of injustice (including the objectively guilty among them).

571,"&gt;I don’t know if you’re being sincere

I'm genuinely only trying to understand why this is seemingly so controversial. I can tell from the downvotes that some people apparently don't think I am, but I don't know what I've said to give that impression.

&gt;The first 2 polls simply ask if they support a 2-state solution. It has no bearing on *what they prefer*. Turkish Cypriots just want recognition, whether that be unified or divided. If you asked “do you support reunification”, I’m sure you would have gotten 75% in favor of.

Thats actually a really good point - I didn't consider the difference between supporting and preferring. I didn't count the 2010 poll obviously though, given that it wasn't about reunification. And the 2019 one seems to be slightly more complicated than you make it appear once you take all of the responses into consideration together - 'The poll concluded that 49.2% of Greek Cypriots were not against the current situation, while 27.6% were not against the two-state solution.'

&gt;The Greeks and a Turks in this thread do not define what Cypriots want and that seems to be what you’re basing your opinion off of.

I don't really understand what you're saying here - I'm literally just basing this off the polls that I linked. I don't have a particular opinion on the matter, I'm just trying to understand the situation,

I'm assuming from the way you've put this though that you are Cypriot. Can you tell me what Cypriots actually do want and whether in general they're more in favour of reunification or a two state solution?

And thank for actually answering - the other two replies seem to have not actually read my comments and instead just replied to what they've apparently imagined I've said.",,/r/europe/comments/lgrnn3/erdogan_says_only_solution_on_cyprus_is_two_states/gmvq50c/,nmcj1996,1613002561
572,"I cross posted this to r/Slovenia and all of the comments are along the lines of ""they had it coming/ we'll chase them to the Piava again"". Needless to say I understand what you are saying a bit more now. But I still believe that the Italians were more bad than our bad guys.

The Italians truly commited unspeakable crimes in Slovenia. They are certainly far far worse than anything we did to them before the war or after it. To be completely honest equating the Slovenian soldiers of WW2 to Italian fascists is a bit insulting. It's like saying the British were just as bad as the Nazis because of the the British bombing of Dresden.

One more important detail that you probably don't know as you are not Slovene is that the foibe were not actually mainly ethnically motivated. The only ethnic group which was exterminated in Slovenia after ww2 were the Germans. They were 5%-10% of the population before the war and were completely wiped out. The Italians on the other hand were allowed to stay and even recognized as a minority. Around 100 000 people of all ethnicities including tens of thousands of Slovenes were murdered by the communists after ww2. As I have said even in my own family. They killed Germans, people who were very critical of communists but mostly people who collaborated with the occupation forces. Here is a link [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass\_graves\_in\_Slovenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_graves_in_Slovenia)

The hate for these people did not come from any abstract historical disputes. It simply came from the fact that the Slovenian soldier had to hide in the mountains in meters of snow without food for 4 years. That is what caused the hate, the killing, the foibe. In my  opinion the Slovene soldiers wanted revenge for what they had been put through. It is no excuse but it is a better excuse than seeing a poster about how there had been a war with Slovenes 20 years before.",,/r/europe/comments/lgyqhw/today_in_italy_we_remember_the_foibe_war_crimes/gmvq8q7/,DoktorFig,1613002612

801,"&gt; Hypothetical UK scenario: Say Lib Dems and SNP did so well last election they had the power to oppose Boris's appointment as PM but would be okay with having Cameron back from retirement, which Tories reluctantly accept to avoid Corbyn becoming PM. That's how VdL became president.

While you're theoretically correct, it doesn't work that way in practice. Or at least the British people would view it as so undemocratic that it could not happen. And members of parliament are attunded to this. 

In the last parliament, there were murmurings of a Soft-Brexit/ People's Vote coalition, perhaps led by the likes of Ken Clarke or Hilary Benn. This, its proponents argued, would allow a presentable candidate to field a majority to stop Brexit as Corbyn was unacceptable. But it didn't happen - mostly because of how obvious an establishment stitch-up it would have been.

For the last time what you're describing happened, you have to go a long way. Ramsay MacDonald or Lloyd George *maybe* fit the bill. This was back in the 20s and 30s. But those were differenet situations, and I'm fairly sure the electorate knew they were getting these grand coalition governments when they voted for them.

A lot of it is down to the fact that British politics works in a very different way to that on the continent - we are used to strong, single party governments here, and punish compromise with a vengence (see the Lib Dems in 2015). When you're more used to coalitions and the necessity of compromise, the apppointment of Von der Leyen becomes far more acceptable.

826,"&gt; ""we are more represented at the worst, so we need to have the majority in the top positions too?""

No? I'm saying that saying women have it worst because a few men are at the top is stupid, when the bottom is dominated by men too.

&gt; Yeah, it is a damn shame that our society gives not a single fuck about many of mens problems. But that doesn't mean that we can't take care of other problems.

It's not ""another problem"", it's the same problem we just chose to ignore it when it affects men.

&gt; Simply saying: ""Maybe you have it bad in cases of [topic x]... but what about [topic y]"" is whataboutism at its finest.

Again, it's the same fucking topic, education.

&gt; Social progress is not a zero-sum game.

Spending money to improve education among women does leave less money to improve education among men.

The fact that men have much higher drop out rates it's a problem, and nobody gives a shit.

These men get completely ignored because again, you only look at the top, you'd rather try to get more women at the top, than improving the lives of people at the bottom.

I think having so many men dropping out of highschool is a bigger issue than not having enough women in IT or wtv.

&gt; believing that they are now being treated worse just because another group is no longer treated as unfairly as in the past

879,"&gt;Can't believe it took this long for a Tory leader to realise the NHS isn't a political hill worth dying on. 

It's not just the Tories. Remember labour was pretty substantial on the privatisation of the NHS. The only hospital ever privatised and outsourced in the UK was by Blair. Everyone like to forget that in the ""Tory evil"" narrative.

Personal, the complete inability to discuss the NHS really pisses me off. It's a flat assumption that the NHS is the best (numbers suggest otherwise) and that it couldn't be improved. Or that the only improvement is clearly more government/more tax money.

Personally I think the NHS should offer private top-up cover. A lot of companies and people pay for private healthcare in the UK and that goes to private hospitals and insurance providers. Those people are paying to skip the queue already so they might as well pay the NHS to do it and buy the NHS more resources in the process that can serve people who aren't paying to skip the queue. But God forbid you suggest such a thing in the public discourse. You'd be crusified.

908,"&gt;David Shor, a member of this community, knowingly harassed and bullied another member of this space. In response to a well-deserved call in over a racist tweet, he encouraged harassment that led to death threats instead of choosing to learn and grow from his mistake. We as the Progressphiles Moderators, professionals in this industry, and as people, absolutely condemn this behavior. It is unacceptable to make people on this list and in this community feel unsafe for calling out wrongdoings. We cannot begin to decolonize our minds if we do not create safety for those fighting against white supremacy. It is on all of us to do this work, but especially to show up for those already doing it and make sure they are safe. By not acting, we are perpetuating the racism and sexism we know exists on this list and in our community at large. As such, we have removed David Shor from Progressphiles.

Saying that black people shouldn't get angry because it hurts Democrats is sort of missing the point. Not saying he should have been fired for it but a private organization made a decision that they are allowed to make. Censorship is not an issue in the United States and almost everyone who claims to have been censored still has a major platform. For example, Congresswoman Taylor Greene complains about censorship while [literally speaking in the congressional chamber on multiple television channels](https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/01/13/20/Greene.jpeg?width=982&amp;height=726&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=75).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/lg4bzm/frances_new_public_enemy_americas_woke_left/gmttbvv/,popfilms,1612972583

The president of the USA is elected through an imperfect system which badly needs updating - however the president chosen is a direct result of electoral success. I.e. the president requires the election of his/her party.

Today, the official website of the Government of Aragon informed about the start of a new pan-European project in which the regional Aragonese Institute of Health Sciences is playing a central role. The initiative, called ROSIA (Remote Rehabilitation Services for Isolated Areas), counts with an overall budget of more than 5.5 million euros and aims to develop a working model for the successful management of chronic conditions of people living in the countryside by the year 2025.

Such a model should include the involvement of the private sector in developing cutting-edge solutions with the help of available technologies. However, it will also require a commitment to self-management and self-care on part of the patients, qualities which might be already intrinsic to people living in remote areas.

This first stage of the project, which also counts with the collaboration of Coimbra University Hospital (Portugal) and the National Rehabilitation Hospital (Ireland), will work towards trying out working models in small scale localities in each of the three participating countries. The idea is with successful results to be able to apply the solutions on a large scale everywhere in the European Union.

Sadly, depopulation of the rural areas is an unescapable reality on the continent and officials have long been grappling with the ideas on how to reverse, or at least manage this trend sustainable without compromising the quality of life in places far away from the cities.

One of the consequences of demographic decline is the ageing of the rural population, which carries the need for comprehensive care for the chronic conditions that arise as a result. The problem is that for the successful treatment of chronic conditions, there is a need for regular consultations with physicians, which entails trips by the patients (or doctors) that end up being time-consuming, costly and unsustainable.",,/r/europe/comments/lgu3ff/new_european_project_looks_into_digitizing/gmtdqhj/,quixotic_cynic,1612965329

ROFLMAO. Who? Because they export more to the UK than the EU they need to increase demand in the domestic market to sell them. Unless people in the EU start to eat more then they can't sell more. 

It's completely different situation to the UK where we import more food than we export so if imports reduce the UK export market can switch to meeting UK domestic demand instead. 

&gt;  What happens then is maybe tomatoes will fall 3% in price across the EU, because more supply for same demand

What an idiot. You've just destroyed your own argument. You claimed that a grower who supplies 50% of their stuff to the UK can just make loseing that with another buyer in the EU instead but you've just admitted that there will be no more demand so there will be more businesses competing for the same reduced market.

1286,"&gt;Serbia's US-educated prime minister was the first European leader to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The country's Russophile internal affairs minister rolled up his sleeve for an armful of Sputnik V. And the health minister happily posed for his injection with Sinopharm's coronavirus shot. These photo-ops were a way of reassuring a sceptical Serbian population about the safety of vaccinations. But they also illustrated an omnivorous approach to procurement that has put Serbia at the front of the race to inoculate people in continental Europe.

&gt;""Whether [vaccines] come from China, the US or EU - we don't care as long as they're safe and we get them as soon as possible,"" Prime Minster Ana Brnabic tells the BBC. ""For us, vaccination is not a geopolitical matter. It is a healthcare issue.""

&gt;Such pragmatism has paid off handsomely. Other countries in the Western Balkans have struggled to secure any vaccine supplies, having placed their hopes on the EU or the international Covax scheme. In contrast, Serbia looks on target to inoculate at least a tenth of its population by the middle of February.

&gt;It is also speeding ahead of all the 27 EU member states - performing vaccinations at around double the rate of Germany, Spain and Italy and four times the speed of the Netherlands. While the prime minister may insist there is no room for geopolitics when it comes to coronavirus, Belgrade's warm relations with Beijing and Moscow have undoubtedly helped bring in quantities of vaccine that EU countries can only envy.

&gt;""I would be equally happy if we got a million vaccines from Pfizer,"" says Ms Brnabic. ""But our foreign policy paid off; I think it was smart and I have to say I'm proud of what we achieved. We are not an EU member, and with all the solidarity there is in the EU, we are bound to be the last to get the vaccines from the EU. That's the downside of not being an EU member, and the strategic focus of my government remains EU accession.""

&gt;But in this moment of crisis, not relying on Brussels for vaccine procurement has been a boon for Serbia. At Belgrade's sprawling World Trade Centre, people who have registered online join a fast-moving queue to get their jabs. The efficiency of the process has raised eyebrows in a country not renowned for dynamic public administration.

&gt;""I'm surprised,"" says 70-year-old Slavic Radonovic. ""I'm a retired health worker and I know that the health sector is good, but I'm surprised with the level of organisation and massive presence of health workers.""

&gt;For Brussels, the optics are not so favourable, as the world sees an EU candidate country conspicuously benefiting from its ties to the East. And, not for the first time, countries in the Western Balkans have discovered that when the chips are down, the EU can be an unreliable partner.

&gt;""The EU is not present here, in terms of a serious political strategy,"" says Vuk Vuksanovic of the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy think-tank. At least one EU country, Hungary, is following Serbia's example by procuring Chinese and Russian vaccines. Others may take the same approach.

The new variant found in Bristol is the British or Kent variant which has mutated again to acquire the E484K mutation, making it more like the South African variant.

Experiments show that a variant with the N501Y, E484K and S447N mutation binds 600 times stronger with the human ACE2 receptors, which increases viral load, transmissibility and severity of infection.

The good new is that this combination of mutations can also be used to make a powerful vaccine.

1577,"&gt;Yes, the same is true in Europe, but the discrepancy in America is vastly larger between an average area and the most dangerous ones.

&amp;nbsp;

Did you accidentally delete your source backing up this argument or are you, like every other conservative on this thread, just throwing out arguments until something sticks?

&amp;nbsp;

The argument isn't just that we have more crime overall (which we do) but also our ""safe areas"" are far more dangerous than their safe areas and that a lot of what you would deem safe would be considered unsafe in Europe. It seems as though a lot of you guys are trying to portray America as European levels of safe but alas this one neighborhood in some state causes our homicide rate to be 5 times higher than places such as Italy. 

&amp;nbsp;

For example, the **most** violent region in the UK is the East region of England with a homicide rate of 1.6 per 100,000. ^[1](https://www.statista.com/statistics/985203/regional-homicide-rate-uk/) Now compare that to states in America and their **most** violent region would be our 2nd or 3rd ^[2](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/table-4) (depending on the year) **safest**. Meanwhile their safe areas are also far more safe than our ""safe"" areas.

&amp;nbsp;


 &gt;There’s nothing wrong with pointing this out, it would be more dishonest not to acknowledge it. 

There is when the context of you saying that is to defend the argument that America is primarily safe just like in European countries. That is because even when looking at *safe* areas of both entities you see that America's safe areas generally look closer to Europe's more dangerous areas.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;People don’t point it out in reference to Europe because it’s not nearly as much of a thing in Europe.

Of course its also a thing in Europe, what a ridiculous assertion. For example a disproportionate amount of the crime overall in Paris are in its poor suburbs. ^[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_situation_in_the_French_suburbs) Just like a disproportionate amount of crime in Chicago's southern neighborhoods. It just ridiculous to even think that is a good argument. Do I really need to go through every country like Sweden has with Malmo and their much higher crime rate than the surrounding areas? 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Yeah, having no-go zones in your country where people live with bars over their windows and there’s a dozen shootings a day is obviously a big fucking problem, and I don’t think many people would say otherwise. 

Most people wouldn't but many people in this thread are using the violence in those neighborhoods to try to deflect away from the safe areas also having a high homicide rate.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But it’s also not wrong or disingenuous to point out that that’s what those places are — specific zones, not generalized common living situations. 

It is when you choose not to include the context of areas outside of those zones having a much higher crime rate than their European counterpart.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;These are just two different issues.
You can’t address the problems that cause these kinds of horrendously unsafe conditions to develop — economic inequality, racial inequality, desperate need for police reform — if you just act like these homicide statistics are indicative of broad sweeping circumstances.

This makes no sense, economic inequality is part of those circumstances just like loose gun laws and having a punitive prison system. These problems aren't contained to one specific area, everything you named is a nation wide problem so of course its okay to generalize certain wide spread problems if they are generally an issue across the nation.

&amp;nbsp;

 &gt;They’re not. It’s overwhelmingly confined to specific areas, indicative of specific issues, 

Cant wait to hear a response to this: Do have a source for racial inequality being overwhelmingly confined to specific areas?

It shouldn't go without saying how utterly ridiculous this comment is to have made.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;and you literally cannot fix the problem without acknowledging that because that reality in itself is the problem.

Of course you can fix a problem like those. Just because some police districts are much worse than others doesn't mean reform isn't worthy of being enacted nationwide.

How does the factory operate for longer than 1 day without being drone striked? It would takes YEARS before the first gun even rolls off the line. The whole reason the cartels make up to 29 billion is because you can spend a couple hundred bucks and make cocain in the jungle. When it gets destroyed, just move and start again. They're like weeds, they blend in and pop up everywhere. You can't just make a big fucking factory. Where do they get the power from? Do they start their own hidden coal power plant next to their hidden factory? Youre acting like they'd be free to do it because no one would try to stop them. They would be stopped, its not the same as drugs which are incredibly difficult to stop the production of. What happens when a factory gets raided and you loose millions upon millions of dollars of construction costs, dozens of highly trained workers, millions of dollars of machinery. What, you do it all again and spend millions and years more setting up another factory? The point of drug manufacturing is that when somewhere gets raided all you actually lose is a couple months of time, since the plants grow back and there is 0 machinery or construction involved. 

The ONLY way they would be able to produce guns in in small workshops with nothing more than a mill and maybe some more tools. This will still be much more expensive and much less profitable than drugs, but it would be possible in many small buildings. The thing is, guns have an economy of scale. If you're making guns in this manner they are going to be expensive as fuck and really shitty. You can only make guns at reasonable prices by increasing the scale of production with efficiency in factories. This is litteraly impossible for the cartel to do without a coup.

Violent crime is a serious problem in the US. Part of the solution is gun control. All I was trying to do in my comment is push back on the narrative that it’s impossible to visit Chicago without getting shot.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3.xls

Whites committed 29.1% of murders, Blacks 39.6%, Other 2.1% and Unknown 29.3%. As an aside, Unknown being so large is weird, but I do not know why this is the case. I am just guessing, but perhaps it is because Other does not include mixed people, at least according to the footnotes wherein it is defined.

Counted separately, Hispanic (of all races) was 9.5%, non-Hispanic 37.7%, and Unknown 52.8%. The footnotes say that Unknown is larger here because not all agencies consider Hispanic vs non-Hispanic.

Note that in the above designations, White also includes not just Europeans, but also many from North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and of course, many Hispanics too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity

We also see from the above link (feel free to get a better source) that by 2017 estimates, Whites are 73% of the population, Blacks 12.7% and other groups making up the rest. Moreover, Hispanics of any race were 17.6% of the population.

So from the above, we see that it is not Mexicans and other Hispanics disproportionately committing the crime. It is not the Chinese or Asians, who barely even register on here. Yes, Whites (and we can infer non-Hispanic Whites) are committing a lot of the overall crime, but relative to their share of the population, it is not the worst. So who is doing it? It is the Black Americans.

1865,"""There have long been several major flaws in Germany’s view of its relationship with Russia: Berlin’s calls for further talks with Moscow, which come whenever Russia makes the headlines, ignore the fact that there is already an abundance of dialogue between the Kremlin and various European leaders – it is just that this dialogue produces no results. A minority of experienced German lawmakers who support more sanctions, military deterrence, and containment do not call for an end to dialogue as such, but are aware that increasing pressure on Moscow would signal that Europeans were serious about their demands. Only then could they expect to make progress on issues of substance.

Germans – along with the French and other Western Europeans – often push to explore possibilities of “selective engagement” with Moscow and cooperation in areas of “common interest”. However, they misjudge the Kremlin’s willingness to cooperate on issues that matter only to the European Union, be it improving European security or implementing climate policy. Furthermore, Europe has no transactional leverage over Moscow. For economic reasons, the EU does not consider imposing hard sanctions on Russia. Moreover, Europe is weak militarily, European intelligence and counter-intelligence is no threat to Russian covert operations in Europe or its neighbourhood, and the EU’s common foreign policy on its eastern neighbourhood so weak as to be easily derailed by military force. In other words, the EU has nothing to offer and nothing to threaten.

The success of the Arab revolt is a myth invented by the Heshmite monarch that rules Jordan, Iraq until 1958 and till the mid-1920s, the Hejaz region of Saudi Arabia. The Arab revolt failed to gain any popular support amongst the average Arabs, and in fact, most Arabs were still loyal to the Ottoman army, with 1/3 of Ottoman casualties in the battle of Gallipoli were Arabs. Most just felt oppressed because of the Young Turks Turkification policies and mostly wanted autonomy within the empire so they can express their Arab identity more freely. 

It only the Heshmites monarchs in the Hejaz region that formed the alliance, and they were never truly popular as evident by their violent killing in Iraq 1958 since they were pretty much imposed onto them by the British. The Saudis easily defeated them for the Hejaz region in the mid-1920s, with little resistance from the local populace. Even in Jordan, the Heshmites family are still reliant on external support like the USA, Saudi, Israel, and in past Pakistan, to keep them in power.

1958,"&gt; Long range shooting for most part.

if you are really into long range target shooting, then the M82 is not your pick. Contrary to popular belief (mainly created by videogames and movies such as Shooter), it is NOT a sniper rifle: too many moving parts in the action, plus the scope rails are not mounted on the barrel but on the upper receiver (due to the short recoil system in the Barret's barrel), therefore the locking process of the bolt is slightly different each time and the accuracty becomes limited to what the ammo can actually do. It was evaluated by the US army as a sniper rifle, but was turned down

True snipers (as in ""hitting a high value human target from 1km+ away"") are mostly single shot bolt actions, such as the L95, L115, Tac-50 or M200 Intervention, which are built with much less parts and tighter tolerances in mind (completely incompatible requirements for a semi-auto).

&gt;In normal country you have judiciary system with oversight from democratically elected government. So for example President or Parliament elects judges.

Examples with sources please.

&gt;Judges themselves chose dude to be elected as judge and President \*\*had to\*\* ""confirm"" him.

Wrong, the President always had discretionary power to appoint judges, but only from among candidates presented to him. It's just that only Kaczyński really exercised this prerogative before 2015.

Frankly I can't even understand what you're saying, so I'll just say one thing: if someone started their studies in 1990, they are now 50. Good luck finding many judges, especially in the lower-tier courts, older than that.

&gt;Anyone in poland who wants to be judge or even work in law had to understand that without family connections you wouldn't get the job because naturally in interest of judges it is only normal to not allow to their midst people outside of their caste.

That's certainly news to me, as since 2009 the Minister of Justice had full control over exams for judges and prosecutors, both entry and final.

&gt;Flows are monitored on a daily basis by the Border Operations Centre. In the last full week (30 Jan to 5 Feb) both outbound and inbound flows (across all UK ports) were close to normal, at 95% outbound and 96% inbound, in spite of the impact of COVID lockdowns on trade.

&gt;For the same week, flows outbound specifically across the Short Straits were at 82%.

That doesn't mean it's the point where life is not worth living.

&gt;If I was in constant intense pain or completely dependent on life supporting machinery, I would want to end my life. And I should have that choice as an individual with free will.

Yes, you can use your free will to do the only thing that will make you absolutely unfree, there's no moralizing that can conjure a law to forbid suicide, but at the very least there must exist things to prevent it. 

To say the least, a doctor has the clear goal to stave off death. 

Ultimately, we evolve based on necessity. If life-supporting machinery is just used to say goodbye and then turned off, there's no incentive to better it. If it's used to make people cling to life for as long as they could, there's incentive to better it, make it smaller, portable.

2303,"&gt; According to statements of Polish survivors, a UPA unit entered the village pretending to be Soviet partisans. The men split up, entered the houses, and demanded food from the residents. Meanwhile, the village was surrounded, and all Poles passing through were also detained. Several UPA members stationed themselves in each household. After dinner, the UPA partisans ordered all the inhabitants to lay down and tied them up, under the pretext that they were about to carry out an assault on a nearby German rail transport and if the village inhabitants were found to be tied up, that would serve as proof for Germans, that Poles did not cooperate with the UPA in the attack. Not all the inhabitants of Parośla believed them, since some of them could speak Ukrainian, but being unarmed, they had no choice but to do as they were told.

&gt; All of the Poles were murdered with knives and axes: old men, women, children (including a six-month-old baby stuck to a table). In the Kolodyński family home, the unit's commander first interrogated the six prisoners (the Cossacks taken at Włodzimierzec) before killing them with axes. Only 12 Poles survived, including a twelve-year-old boy named Witold Kołodyński, who suffered a cracked skull from an axe blow. The houses were looted and property was taken away on sleighs.

On this occasion, we look at the most common identification procedures used for accessing online services (please note that an internet user can use more than one identification procedure).

In 2020, 3 in 4 people in the EU aged 16-74 logged in to online services using their username and password. This share varied across the EU Member States: in the Netherlands, 91% of people aged 16-74 used this login method, whereas Romania recorded the lowest share (45%).

The second most popular identification procedure was a ‘code received by message on a mobile phone’, which was used by 46% of people aged 16 -74. It was followed by use of a ‘social media login’ (34%), an ‘electronic identification certificate or card used for example with a card reader or with an app’ (22%) as well as a ‘single-use PIN code list or random characters of a password’ (22%).

**Identification procedure involving mobile phone most popular in Denmark, lowest in Bulgaria**

The share of people who logged in to online services using their mobile phone where a code is received through a message also varied across the EU. The highest shares were observed in Denmark (76%), the Netherlands (74%) and Czechia (73%).

2385,"China is perhaps the most ruthlessly capitalist country in the world. What they have right now and what creates growth is certainly not planned economy but a restrictive form of market capitalism. 

Planned economy is production for use, not production for profit. Furthermore profits are retained in companies and not distributed via a dividend to the people. The people do NOT own the companies, even though they might own some on paper only. Furthermore through the economic zones (which lead the chinese economy) they have established an economy that is just about entirely market driven, though strongly policed by the state. 

A planned economy would never, never produce so much useless trash. 

As for collectivization, first I find your China argument weird because on paper it is just as collectivized as it is a planned economy. However to add something substantial here Mondragon in the Basque Country has a yearly revenue comparable to the GDP of Northern Macedonia and is a worker cooperative. There are plenty of examples of collective ownership working well.

2387,"&gt; Proof

Because their poster child, Navalny, is either a useful idiot or an asset for Democratic Party. In DNC’s view, Russia is responsible for Trump and 4 years of “dictatorship”, and naturally they want revenge. Navalny returning to Russia served two, and two goals only(both being the goals of DNC): harm Russian economy with more sanctions, provide another lever for applying pressure on NS2. 

Sanctions under Magnitsky act served only to harm the coffers of oligarchs and not the Russian economy as a whole. The situations are similar at first glance: both were lawyers, fighting corruption and injustice, but Magnitsky had no foreign backers and Navalny does. Every time government responds to Navalny’s actions, more sanctions ruining Russia’s economy get introduced.

If America really wanted to force a color revolution, they would target the oligarchs who would respond to enough pressure with deposing Putin. But all they seek is further weakening Russia, and Navalny seems to be serving their goals under every opportunity. Why doesn’t America freeze their assets abroad? Why doesn’t Italy confiscate chief state tv propagandist’s villa? Because they like corrupt money and will never end it’s flow. Which is why Navalny “stopping corruption” is IMPOSSIBLE, because his masters **do not want it**.

&gt; Will happen this and that imagination, what does the oil industry has to do with democracy?

Because oligarchic and democratic system allow billionaires to pressure the government with their money, bribing and lobbying politicians. Considering that oil magnates control the majority of the wealth, that puts them in prime position to slow down the economic growth by bribing politicians to introduce bills that benefit oil industry at expense of everyone else.

&gt; It's not like they had/have democracy, so the social credit didn't make a difference. Democracy is a constant struggle, so easy to be authoritarian, just look at world history.

And yet this system can be introduced elsewhere, as total control was introduced in Xinjang with insane efficiency. They can’t even physically leave their neighborhood if government blocks their ID card. 

&gt; At least we can tackle this issue in the west where we have some transparency and the public can be informed; you will never find out in authoritarian countries, and you won't have a say anyway!

2544,"MP Laurent Mosar (CSV) believes that it is not accurate to call the Grand Duchy a tax haven, considering the high tax rates that Luxembourgish residents and businesses have to pay. He also acknowledged that individual companies are indeed able to benefit from ""agreements of no double-taxation"". However, he stressed that this was also the case in other countries, places such as the US State of Delaware, which Mosar referred to as being a veritable tax haven.

MP Roy Reding (ADR) noted that the risk for money laundering existed everywhere around the world, and that Luxembourg was not exempt from the threat of organised crime: ""However, no other country in Europe is a rigorous as we are when it comes to supervision.""

Some MPs also highlighted the fact that the piece of investigative journalism proved the country's level of transparency. LSAP leader Georges Engel underlined that the government continuously worked on the successful supervision of the financial sector, noting that the Chamber is set to vote on a new set of regulatory dispositions to combat money laundering schemes.

MP David Wagner (The Left) explained that with all due respect to the criticism, one should not state that the Grand Duchy's financial sector has made it its goal to attract organised criminals. He acknowledged however that Luxembourg's implementation of tax optimisation necessarily attracts a lot of interest from foreign parties, which always increases the danger of financial abuses.

However it is also true that majority of the jobs are not something what would people enjoy doing voluntarily, they are doing it just so they can do what they like doing voluntarily.

Not OP, but this is where you are wrong. 

First, for keeping the union together does not require and has not resulted in punitive measures. But it does require the obvious, namely that the UK will be in a worse situation than it was while being a member state.

Second, keeping the union together does not mean that the prosperity of the citizens is neglected. In fact, keeping the union together is precisely what ensures the prosperity of EU citizens. This is why, for example, the German industry, contrary to what many in the UK had expected, has not put much lobbying efforts into making trade concessions to the UK. Even though this means losses for the companies, they have come to the conclusion that keeping the union together is more important than seemless trade with the UK.",Berlin,/r/europe/comments/lf9tcg/brexit_red_tape_makes_it_easier_for_eu_nations_to/gmnph9g/,nibbler666,1612840602

The EU is not a large centralized government. Money is flowing both at the EU level and from the individual member countries.

The UK also contributed very significantly to such international initiatives, whereas the US did not.

Those published per capita numbers go back to a report by a company called Airfinity, but that considered only less than half of the EU expenses, ignored any expenses by the individual member states, and the details of the report aren't even public, and thus cannot be scrutinized.

I have a few ideas what else could be tracked, but I would be heavily downvoted for that, so I will just give an alternative to that that is not very accurate but much more objective and less manipulable than GDP.

I think economists should look at kWh consumption:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption

Alternatively kWh/capita, there is extensive data for this:

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC?end=2014&amp;start=1997

It's a robust less manipulable indicator and it is directly tied into production/consumption. Yes yes, energy usage is not efficient and people waste electricity on all useless stuff, but it's impossible to measure utility, however it must be a better metric than GDP which can be manipulated much easier.

Romania is of course a poorer country than Italy, and will remain so for some time, but if we look at differences between regions, it's interesting to look at them in Western and Southern Europe but also in CE Europe. To give another example,, the Bucharest-Ilfov region has a higher GDP/capita (PPS) than Lombardy, Trento or Emilia-Romagna, some of the richest regions of Italy. All this just to say that the picture is more nuanced, that RO, BG are not that poor as they used to and that yes, large parts of Romania have it better than Calabria.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/lfajpb/czech_republic_overtakes_spain_in_gdp_per_capita/gmmoa5l/,Ro99,1612821702
2781,"Again, the fact that Tsipras betrayed everything he supposedly stood for doesn't mean that Mitsotakis is any better.

In fact he did the exact same thing. He campaigned under the guise of liberalism but ended up being the closest thing to the military junta we've had ever since. Talk about ""going back on his words"".

But apart from that, this government hasn't actually done a single positive thing. They didn't improve anything, they did not fix anything and in many cases they made things worse. I truly wonder why would you support such a government? Just out of spite for Tsipras? I mean, I don't like SYRIZA or Tsipras either, but cmon, Mitsotakis and his authoritarian buddies are not the answer.

The communist party was the same before him as well, they've just robbed, imprisoned and murdered less, but it was the same authoritarian regime and the same ideology using the same tools, the only thing that held them back was the fear that they'd spark a revolution that could depose them by doing so much more harm against the people.  
The ""good commies"" is the same ideologically-driven lying as the ""clean wermacht"", the only difference is that it's not the wermacht sympathizers who are sitting in western academia, so it's the ""good commies"" false history that's being lent institutional credibility. The ""good commies"" were either killed/exiled by the same authoritarian ideological system they were part of before they too got to be in charge of manifesting it or they are rehabilitated by bolshevik academics, for example Lenin.

I'll give you some highlights

&gt; Outside Indigenous communities and cultures, the use of oral histories serves as a way to decolonize Canadian history. This means reinserting Indigenous narratives that historically have been overlooked or ignored.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Increasingly, academics, historians and museum curators are using and highlighting oral histories to provide first-hand accounts and knowledge about Indigenous ways of life and perspectives.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; *Turning the Page: Forging New Partnerships between Museums and First Peoples* (1992) — have encouraged being inclusive of Indigenous perspectives. Similarly, the call to become more inclusive of oral histories has been acknowledged by the 1996 report of the [Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/royal-commission-on-aboriginal-peoples) and the 2015 [Truth and Reconciliation Commission](https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/truth-and-reconciliation-commission)’s *Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future* report. 

Hmm, since the 1990s/ ""Honoring the truth"" in their national museum. Yeah, oral history is total trash.

&gt; Indigenous oral histories have become central to certain court cases about [Indigenous rights](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-rights). In the [Delgamuukw case](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/delgamuukw-case) (1997), the [Supreme Court](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/supreme-court-of-canada) deemed that oral history is an important type of evidence that courts must treat as equal to other types of evidence. This ruling had an impact on future court cases about [Aboriginal title](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-title) and rights, including in the Tsilhqot’in case (2014).

2914,"&gt;Industrialization started around the turn of the century and was well under way before the commie takeover.

Yes, but the real industrialization occurred after the soviets took over. But even so, the manner in which it was carried out and precisely *how* they managed to finance this huge effort has an interesting background.

”Fun” bit of history. Romania sent to Russia its gold reserves during WW1 (120 tonnes), for ”safe keeping”. Only 77 grams were returned until 2021, nothing of the gold reserves.

In 1997, upon being asked by the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs again about it, the Russian M. of F.A. replied something along the lines of ”stop it. How do you think the USSR funded the industrialization and the second war? It's been gone a long time”.

Whether it's true or not (this is what the Romanian M. of F.A. reported in his memoirs, iirc), I'd say it's very likely that the soviets, in the 1920s and early 30s, didn't let that gold reserves untouched/go to waste, and used every bit to fund the industrialization. In any case, they've been used and don't exist anymore.

My point is *not* that it was fully funded from those gold reserves alone, only that it helped a lot and that **Stalin has thus no merit**. Especially since he industrialized a country through theft and *forcefully* mobilized huge masses of people, causing mass hunger, etc. No merit whatsoever when done in these conditions.

Mitsotakis actually has decent understanding of business. 

Also, unlike Tsipras he actually attempted at the very least to be stricter with matters such as illegal immigration. I wouldn't even be able to imagine what would have happened if Turkey's attack with migrants happened during the Tsipras administration. 

I think that Mitsotakis tho a part of ""the elite"" which means they always believe that rules do not affect them and will act as such, actually is a much better leader of a country than whatever Tsipras thought he was. And has a vision which was stifled by the virus , of course. I also believe that Mitsotakis handled a very difficult period in the country just months after his election quite well. 

People have found an easy scapegoat with the lockdowns currently, as if Tsipras or anybody else would be doing something differently than what Mitsotakis is doing...or actually, i could imagine Tsipras ignoring the virus long enough for our health system to collapse before he decided to shut down the country during the initial wave.

Northern Italy benefiting from Austria historically? Well you could argue and turn it around that the first modern state running, monetary banking and a first standardised cross-European system came from Italy - from the Roman times and later Italian wealthy cities.

You could add state religion to that list by the Romans, that unified nations to feel companionship and reasons to form coalitions against non-christian inhabitants.

South Europe was arguably the foundation for Europe. So BS on specifically bringing ""North Italy"" as some benefactory of the ""West"" history when a lot of the base for ""the Western world"" came from North Italy and Italy.

I would say in modern times sure, capitalism has become the current norm but the winds can change drastically. Venezuela was one of the success stories of South America - now they are in serious hyper inflation. We have yet to see the outcome of Brexit long term. 2008 economy crash is what Spain was vurnable too. Greece managed to screw themselves with the Euro. Germany still has differences between the West and East sides.

France some centuries ago crashed and burned with their own collapse that formed their modern republic. China and India are becoming economical powerhouses and with more money have more to say in how the world is run. Russia with their resources could hope for better management and a flourishing system.

Petrol countries are still ""richest"" with one resources altough as we can see innovation is replacing the need for it. And we just had Trump who tried to basically screw their former allies in the Old world, surely caused some instability among relations and inside the US by creating a seemingly deeper split in politics.

the UK is big and rich enough to say fuck our industry and the fishing dudes and the farmers. we give other nations and trade blocks everything they want as long as we get as much access to their financial markets as possible.

3071,"In general I agree with your points, but I think you are wrong on this one. I understand that as a German, and a sponsor of BioNTech, you have high expectations. Germany could have added a ""Germany First"" clause and be top of the table of the vaccination rate instead of UK. This is true, and Germany made a sacrifice which I hope will be acknowledged by the other EU members. At the same time, the long term goal for Germany, and indeed any other EU member, should be to preserve and improve the union, which would not work if each nation will try to carve its own path forward.  

If you follow non-political sources, you would know that the timing of signing the contract and how much was paid per vaccine is not the bottleneck. This is one of those instances where throwing more money at the problem will not solve the problem any faster. Scaling up the manufacture of a vaccine is not like adding 100 more instances to the AWS pool. There are strong technical and human limitations in scaling up processes which inherently have a very high rate of failure already.
  
Given that the resources are limited, there are two ways forward. You either attempt to grab a bigger share of the resources at the expense of other countries, which some countries which will remain unnamed did, or, you try to be equatable and allow other countries a chance at vaccinating their people. Germany could have done the former but they chose the latter. Who signed the contract and when is just political theater.

Absolutely not comprable with the EU, where the laws CANNOT be proposed by the parlament, but the European commission, who’s members are appointed, not elected (except the president, who is nominated by the council and approved by the parlament. But then the coucil (not elected, I repeat!) can nomitate only one single candidate, as they did, in which case we cannot talk about democracy.)

Why is this a problem? Because the EU bureaucrats have absolutely NO accountability for their actions, they cannot be voted out if the public disagrees with them. EU council and commision is a dumping ground for unsuccessful EU politician who couldn’t manage to get re-elected by their proper country-wide elections.

Another reason why the EU is not a democracy is because it doesn’t have a demos. The various nations are to fragmented and not at all united.

“ No class or other social divisions in Europe take a homogeneous “European” form, for there are no occupational, organizational, habitual, cultural, and historical norms able to create such an overarching social integration. Actual class divisions in Europe always take a national form, as do the party politics that correspond to these divisions. In Marxist terms there is neither a European capitalist class nor a European working class.”

&amp;#x200B;

There's been a lot of new opportunities here in Spain as many multinationals and startups set up shop in places like Madrid, Barcelona, and to a lesser extent, Valencia and  Malaga. 

&amp;#x200B;

This boom was so apparent that the demand for housing in these places skyrocketd, driving up rents as there was internal migration along wtih many foreigners moving here for work ( the government and the populace blame airBnB for the rise in rents when it reality, it was the overall demand for housing driven by a healthier economy driving rents). 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue that Spain faced -- and is still facing -- is that it had a deep hole to dig out of post-2011.  Austerity was overall a net positive for this country. The only problem is that the work is undone. Spain still needs to make labor market reforms and separate politics from certain aspects of the economy.

This is very wrong, though the answer is complicated. 

Your body is always affected by exposure to ionizing radiation. The severity and type/location of dose is what matters. You're right about *potentially* increasing the chance the damage done by the exposure, but there isn't a zero chance at any level of exposure. Just super remote, or super likely. The higher the dose, the greater the chance of damage. Some people smoke for decades and don't get lung cancer. Some people get exposed to secondhand smoke for less time, and do.

[There are thresholds of exposure](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ionizing-radiation-health-effects-and-protective-measures) that are know to impair organ functions, but it's not all fine below these thresholds, they are just the best known ranges for measurable health damage.

This is the thing people don't understand about an event like Fukushima. The risk is not uniform.

Real life is not a computer game where you can just magic up a new nuclear industry and the social licence to conjure new plants into existence faster and cheaper than has ever been done before.

&amp;#x200B;

You're absolutely right on the last point about unions and coal. Though the thing is: miners are being put out of work by the coal companies in the tens of thousands the last few years, and this isn't slowing down at all. So in the end, without proper planning Poland will be left with no coal industry, a few hundred thousand pissed off miners, and expensive power.

3230,"Due to the neverending, often baseless attempts, of several Slavic ethnic groups to distance themselves from eastern Europe and indeed a Slavic identity, due to the western perception of those being lowly or inferior bleeding into their own society, I tend to be extremely skeptical of these claims.

One such attempt was made in Slovenia, when Nationalists strived to garner support for the break from Yugoslavia, it gained quite a bit of popularity, and for a time, in my youth even i have been deceived by it.. The claim was that, in actuality, Slovenes were NOT of Slavic origin and thus the Yugoslav slogan ""Brotherhood and unity"" shall mean nothing to us, for we are in fact, Venetic, of the people who live to the west in todays Italy... Which turned out to be utter nonsense.

Won't happen without reforms passed by Teams Red and Blue. Who only stand to lose by removing FPTP.

3317,"&gt; Reis dediklerinin bazıları yanlış gibi geldi bana.

Öyle ise çok özür dilerim, bu sadece yemek masasında konuşulan başlıklardan topladıklarım. 

&gt; 1.	⁠Nihal Atsız sadece far right bi adam değil gayet iyi bir şair ve yazardı.

&gt; İlber Ortaylı ve Murat Bardakçı Nihal Atsız hakkında konuşuyor

&gt; Burda Akşener Atsız'ın kafatasçılığını seviyorsa bu pek affedilecek bişey değil. Fakat sanatsal yönünü seviyorsa sorun yok bence. Meral Akşener'in Nihal Atsız'ı nasıl sevdiğini bilmiyorum o yüzden kesin bişey söyleyemem.

Ben burda sizinle aynı görüşte değilim, genel olarak sanatkar ve sanatçıyı ayırt etmekte zorlanmam ama sanatkar siyaset yapıyorsa, benim görüşlerim ile bırak zıt olmayı benim ırkıma “içimizdeki düşmanlar” diyorsa ben Shakespeare olsa bile sanatına bir dakikamı vermem. Irk kelimesini kullanmayı sevmiyorum, ama hangi sözü kullanacağıma bilmedim. 

Sizce nasıl seviyordur? Sanatsal yoksa siyasal tarafını mı seviyordur? Ermenilere ve Kürtlere karşı dolaylı ve açık ırkçılık yapan birisi sizce sanatı için Atsız’ı sevmiş olabilir mi? 

&gt; 2. Atsız'ın Atatürk düşmanı olması önemli değil ki muhtemelen değil.

&gt; Bu ekşi makalesinde baya güzel yazılar var

&gt; Reis kişi kültüne kapılmayalım bence sonuçta iyi bir toplum ve devlet kurmak için Atatürk'ü takip etmemize gerek yok.

Katılıyorum ama onu yazma sebebim ilk başta sizin Atatürkçü olduğunuzu düşündüğüm içindi. Profiline girdikten sonra Erdoğancı olduğunuzu gördüm. Hakikaten Erdoğancı musunuz yoksa troll sub mu? Merak ediyorum sadece, yanlış anlamayın. 

&gt; Bunların dışında dediklerin gayet mantıklı geldi. Günümüzde nazi artığı partilerin olması, özellikle mhp nin mafya gibi takılması, kabul edilebilir bişey değil. Akşener de eski mhpli ve muhtemelen paralel düşüncelere sahip. Bu aşırı parti yıllardır cehaleti ve  ırkçılığı yayıyor. Yurtdışında bile oluşumları kapatılıyor. Darısı bizim başımıza.

Katılıyorum. Darısı benim ülkemin(İsveç’in) başına... Sokak lambalarında Alparslan Türkeş posterleri görmüşlüğüm var... Bana direk bir zararı olmasa da insan yine de bi değişik hissediyor kendini.

3340,"Since the comment above yours was deleted before I could post my comment -- which was asking about the impact -- I'm going to respond to your comment.

&gt; On a scale of 1 to we're screwed how bad is this?

My layman's understanding:

**Impact of this result on people using AZ vaccine**

Keep in mind that ""failed to protect against mild forms"" doesn't mean that it's useless -- it just means that the immune response it causes the body to have isn't strong enough to keep you from developing at least some symptoms.  Having enough of an immune response to stop people from dying is very much a good thing.  It may also slow the spread.  Obviously, it'd be nice to have something that fully eliminates any symptoms of the disease, but lessening its effects to not kill you would be desirable.

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/south-africa-suspends-astrazeneca-vaccination-launch-over-study-2365397

&gt;But in a full paper due to be published on Monday, AstraZeneca said that none of the 2,000 participants developed serious symptoms.
&gt;
&gt;That could mean it will still have an effect on severe illness, although not enough data is available yet to make a definitive judgment.

**Existing use of AZ**

For the US, at the moment, not much in the immediate term, because we weren't expected to approve AZ for emergency use in the US anyway due to the FDA being unhappy with AZ's testing until sometime in April at least.  Right now, everyone in the US is being vaccinated with doses from Pfizer or Moderna.  I saw one article saying that preliminary data was that the response from Moderna is weaker ([one-sixth the antibodies generated](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/moderna-announces-vaccine-upgrades-protect-against-emerging-variants-n1255538), and that Moderna is working on updating their vaccine to address the new COVID-19 variant).  It still has a substantial impact, so I assume that the high starting efficacy helps.  The single-shot [Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/health/covid-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-variants.html) which we'd been expected to approve shortly is apparently still effective, but is also weaker against the South African variant, towards the low end of the scale of what we had been shooting for in a vaccine.

So in terms of ""how much do the AZ results impact the existing US vaccination shots"", they do not at this point.  Health authorities will at least be able to consider the tradeoffs before using AZ here.  However, it eliminates one option that we could have used.

The EU had *just* approved AZ for use, so probably similar -- not a lot of people who already have AZ vaccinations.  So the news doesn't mean much for existing vaccinations in the EU.  The EU's vaccine supply situation is tighter than ours, so having the AZ doses was more-near-term important to the EU.

The UK had relied heavily on AZ for existing vaccinations, so that may be significant for the UK.

**Long-term impact**

[E484K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2#E484K), which I understand *may* be the mutation that is or at least is part of what makes the [B.1.351](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_of_Concern_202012/01) variant (aka ""South Africa variant"") resistant to vaccine has been developed by a child of [B.1.1.7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_of_Concern_202012/01), (aka ""British variant"").  As I understand it, the ""negative"" side of this is that it may be that there's an easy mutation for the virus to make that multiple branches have independently done at this point that substantially reduces efficacy of existing vaccine.  [B.1.1.248](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_P.1), the ""Brazil"" variant, apparently also has this mutation (though I don't know whether that's an independent mutation or common to one of the other variants).  On the ""positive"" side, the fact that it's independently evolved means that this may be ""low-hanging fruit"" for the virus -- like, that there aren't *lots* of mutations that make it dramatically more-effective, if two or maybe three branches all independently evolved this.

My understanding is that it's easier to adapt the mRNA-based vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, CureVac) to new variants of COVID-19 than the traditional ones.  So this might increase their importance and make scaling up of those even-more-critical if a new variant needs to be rolled out quickly.

I don't know how practical it is to update the J&amp;J single-shot vaccine.

My understanding is that a major goal of the AZ vaccine is to make a vaccine that could be inexpensively produced and inexpensively-distributed.  So I think that any undesirable AZ results are more one of a global concern than a direct issue for Europe -- like, AZ is the best-suited vaccine of all of the ones being produced for the poorer parts of the world.  AZ's efficacy is probably going to be a ceiling on what a lot of the world can get in at least some near-term timeframe.

I don't know what happens if you vaccinate someone with multiple vaccines for COVID-19, whether they can interact.  I don't think that it's been tested at scale, though I'm sure that domain experts can make an educated guess as to impact.

**Political implications**

I think that, as some other comments have pointed out, that this is unfortunately tied up in politicization surrounding Brexit.  That is, the dispute over AZ efficacy on this sub has become something of a proxy fight over the merits of Brexit.  So this sub *probably* is not where I would go to get an unvarnished estimate of the impact.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/lew2cr/astrazeneca_vaccine_has_limited_protection_for/gmjkpj4/,duisThias,1612754249

The genocide in Darfur.  
The genocide in Rwanda.  
The genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  
The genocide in Cambodia.  
The 1949 genocide in China also called the ""cultural revolution.""  
The genocide in Tibet.  
The 1937 Rape of Nanking.  
The Ukrainian genocide.  
The Sami genocide by concentration camps in 1932 by Russia.  
The Sami genocide in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia (plus other genocides).  
The Armenian genocide.  
The Herero Genocide.  
The American Genocides - from the tip of Canada to the bottom of Chile.  
The Transatlantic slave trade genocides.  
The geocide of the Ainu by Japan.  
The genocide of Copts by Greece.  
The Assyrian genocide of the Christians.  
The Holocaust in 1941 of: the Jewish, the Roma, the Sinti, the Polish, the Slavic, Catholics, devout Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses, religious teachers, Blacks, Gays, the Disabled, Communists, anyone interracially married, the unemployed, drug addicts, prostitutes, welfare recipients, and generally anyone the political party and their base deemed unsavory or a threat - as many as 35 million people.

And here are some current, ongoing genocides:  
The genocide in China of the Uyghur.  
The genocide in United states against the South Americans  
The Genocide in Canada against the Native Americans

The Iraq genocide of the Yazidis

First time violence without impact to health gets you a fine or 10-15 arrest or 60-120 hours of community service. Does not get you a ""criminal conviction"" status, which is important elsewhere in our laws.


Second time without impact to health gets you a criminal conviction, a bigger fine tied to your wages or 240 hours of community service or 6 months of labor colony or 3 months arrest. 

If there were even minimal lasting effects you get up to 2 years prison (this has not changed and only goes up with the degree of damage). If the physical or psychological abuse was systemic - up to 3 years of prison, if the victim was a dependent (child, old person or a non-working spouse) minimal sentencing of 3 years and up to 7. 


The change in the law removed a quirk of our criminal code which equated domestic violence to a hate crime (as in racial, ethnic hate) with an automatic criminal conviction. It also added the part about repeat offenders.

The drawing represents the shooting of the rebels (presumably) of Madrid by the French troops. France had invaded the country (we let them enter to conquer Portugal but they decided to take Spain on their way). The crown had been knowingly given to Napoleon by our shittiest king in Spanish history and the french were trying to get all the royal family out of Madrid. On the second of may of 1808, when the french where about to get the last royals out, the city of Madrid revolted. What followed was absolute chaos. As Murat said: rivers of french blood run through the streets. The army required vengeance. The looters would be arrested and shot. The French army arrested indiscriminately any man with an arm, even razors, common work tools back then. Then they were condemned to death without any trial and shot in various significant places of the city at 4 in the morning.

Yes, it’s other countries that got us rid of nazis, but it’s the Czech president Beneš that decided to expulse all Germans from the country (3 million people I believe). And that also changed history.

Russians left because communism failed (as it always does) and Russia imploded. Still, trains full of Soviet army equipment were departing from Czechia everyday until 1993! Imagine the amount of stuff.

3693,"I would like to know what you base your conclusions on South-Tyrol (hereinafter also ""ST"") on. In my (very intimate) experience with the Region and its history I would argue that it is the place least likely for this specific kind of fake news to pop up. This presumption is based on (other than my personal anecdotal data) on the fact that a) South Tyrol is one of the areas that suffered most under fascism since basically the entire population (being an ethnic minority) was viciously persecuted, and b) despite Mussolini's best efforts, ST is still predominantly populated by ethnic Germans/Austrians. Point b) is relevant insofar that, due to the fact that - again despite the Italian governments best efforts - schools work mostly in German, ST kids are taught (by teachers and books) more German than Italian history, and the former is extremely focused on WW2. On the contrary I would claim that in ST people tend to learn more than enough about the holocaust and not enough about Italian fascism.

Secondly, I would like to point out that ST is - and has been since its occupation by Italy - ruled by a centrist government which enjoys - and always has enjoyed - an overwhelming majority in the Landtag.

Lastly, you seem to have fallen victim to the common misconception that ""right-wing"" = Nazi = holocaust-denier. Due to pretty obvious historic reasons (e.g. the fact that fascism basically tried to purge ST from its inhabitants after Italy tore the territory from the state it ethnically belonged to) there is a (absolutely minoritarian) secessionist movement which on the common political spectrum qualifies as ""right-wing"" but whose fundamental political ideology is secession, and not xenophobe sentiments or let alone antisemitism.

&gt; In 1975, the business community was pretty clear about its answer to that question. A month before the referendum, The Economist published a poll of 653 chief executives, in which a staggering 95 per cent declared their support for staying in the Common Market. No fewer than 363 companies made contributions of more than £100 to the Britain in Europe campaign, whilst just one gave more than £100 to the rival National Referendum Campaign. This disparity resulted in one of the most lopsided campaigns, at least in terms of funding, in British political history. The pro-EEC side raised almost £1.5 million (about £13.5 million in today’s money). In contrast, the anti-EEC camp raised less than £150,000 (most of which came from the government).

3950,"&gt;The Court said  it  was  not  its  task to  evaluate  the  merits  of  a  UK  withdrawal  from  the  EU  without  an agreement. The  case before  it  was whether  the  Withdrawal  Act  imposes  a  constraint  on  those negotiating with the EU 27 to proceed on the basis that the UK can only leave the EU if an agreement is   reached   so   that   the   operation   of   the   Agreement   continues   undisturbed   and the   existing arrangements for the all-island economy continue unimpeded by any hard border.

.

&gt;The general rule is that the power to  make  or  unmake  treaties  is  exercisable without  legislative  authority  and  that  the  exercise  of  that power is not reviewable by the courts.  This principle rests on the so-called dualist theory, which is based  on  the  proposition  that  international  law  and  domestic  law  operate  in  independent  spheres. The prerogative power to make treaties depends on two related propositions.

.

&gt;This  appeal was not  directly  concerned  with  the  making  or  unmaking  of  treaties but  with  the negotiations  which  are  likely  to  lead  to  the  making  or  unmaking  of  treaties.

From the ruling. 

&gt;Neither of them can be construed as requiring a customs Union or continued regulatory alignment.

I don't know where you cited it from as I didn't find it in the linked Summary of judgement.  That sentence is correct. The issue was always that a ""Hard"" Border could infrige on the North-South Cooperation/ all-Island economy.


To cite from Belfast Agreement.

&gt;Under a new British/Irish Agreement dealing with the totality of relationships, and related legislation at Westminster and in the Oireachtas, a North/South Ministerial Council to be established to bring together those with executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government, to develop consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland - including through implementation on an all-island and cross-border basis - on matters of mutual interest within the competence of the Administrations, North and South.


To go back to the Judgment:

&gt;The  Withdrawal  Act  was  made  on  26  June  2018  with  the  purpose  of  repealing  the  European Communities Act 1972 and making other provision in connection with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom  from  the  EU.    Section  10  was  introduced  by  Lord  Patten  in  the  House  of  Lords.    The heading of section 10 is “Continuation of North-South  Co-operation  and  the  prevention  of  new border arrangements”.   In its judgment, the Court set out the debate that took  place  when  the provision was being introduced (paragraphs [31] –34]).  Lord Patten said the provision would bring into  legal  effect  the  commitments  the  UK  Government  had  already  made  to  the  EU  and  would provide  clarity  and  legal  certainty,  ensuring unimpeded  cross  border  movement  and  north  south cooperation.  In the House of Commons, David Liddington MP said the amendment was a statement of  Government  policy  and  sought  to  ensure  that  it  would  not  act  incompatibly  with  the  NIA  and prevent, among otherthings, physical infrastructure on the border with Ireland. 


It was always been about the North-South cooperation. 
The worry is/was that a ""hard"" Border would infringe that.

It seems VDL or her staff added the Article 16 reference shortly before signing, giving commissioners less than an hour to even read the document. It wasn't discussed previously and the responsible commissioner was against any kind of such export regulation. Still VDL now publicly blames him.

It's something she already did in Germany. Solely listen to her staff / consultants, but in case something goes wrong shift the blame to some subordinate. She's a horrible leader and will never accept responsibility - as you can see with all her screw-ups in Germany as minister of defence.

4031,"&gt;Not much of a nazi, is he.

Except these parts:

&gt;On 20 July, Noreika led a ""Manifestation of Freedom and Friendship with Germany,"" where a crowd of thousands approved a resolution that he had written in support of Lithuania's Provisional Government and complete independence, as well as the German Army, the Reich and Hitler, and the Lithuanian Activist Front. A week and a half later, a group of Samogitian local leaders chose Noreika to head the Iron Wolf-affiliated Žemaičių žemė ('Land of Samogitia') delegation, which was tasked with negotiating unity between the Provisional Government, the Lithuanian Activist Front and the Lithuanian Nationalist Party. On 30 July, Noreika participated in a committee in Telšiai which sentenced Jurgis Endriuška to three months of a labour camp for leading a Communist Youth choir.

&gt;Noreika was appointed governor of the Šiauliai district on 3 August 1941. He issued orders on 22 August and 10 September 1941 on sending all the Jews of the district to ghettos and on the confiscation and distribution of their property. Many Jews were shot on the spot instead. Noreika also sent a proposal on 23 August to Lithuania's General Counselors that they permit the construction of a forced labour camp at Skaistgirys to imprison 200 Lithuanian ""undesirables."" Noreika returned to Plungė, and his family moved into a home nearby on Vaižganto 9, which had belonged to the Jewish Orlianskis family. He was sent by the Nazis on a propaganda trip to Germany from 31 January 1943 to 16 February 1943 as part of a group of 14 Lithuanian officials.

And his labour camp experience was very mild compared to what Jewish prisoners had to suffer.

&gt;On 17 March, the Nazis again arrested Noreika along with 45 other Lithuanian political, intellectual and religious authorities, and the group was brought to the Stutthof concentration camp on 26–27 March. They were housed separately from other inmates, allowed to wear civilian clothes, move about freely throughout the camp, receive parcels, write letters, and continue their education. Noreika studied English, but persisted in believing that the Nazis would defeat the Allies.

How many Jews were allowed to study english and send letters in concentration camps? Zero.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/lay823/no_more_lies_my_grandfather_was_a_nazi_in/glu9um4/,Canal_Volphied,1612340415

4273,"""As Western governments faced criticism for their pandemic management last summer, European Union officials began work on a vaccine-procurement plan they hoped would put the continent at the forefront of efforts to banish [the coronavirus](https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/coronavirus-6dcf2a21?mod=article_inline) and reopen economies.

Instead of its 27 member states fighting for doses from a few manufacturers, the European Commission, the closest the bloc has to a government, would centralize purchases for some 450 million inhabitants, bringing prices down and ensuring that residents of rich and poor countries alike would get equal access to the best shots available.

Half a year later, [an acute shortage of doses is keeping the EU’s vaccination effort from taking off](https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-government-told-not-to-use-astrazeneca-vaccine-for-elderly-11611852649?mod=article_inline), making it likely that only a small portion of the general public will get a shot by the end of summer. The reasons: The EU was late in ordering vaccines compared with the U.S. and the U.K.; [it bet on companies that have yet to deliver](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccination-in-europe-to-roll-out-slowly-11607715115?mod=article_inline); and when delays started creeping in, it blamed the manufacturers instead of restarting negotiations.

“There are about 10 hard weeks of vaccine deficiency ahead of us,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn told journalists over the weekend. “More \[vaccines\] could have been ordered, and faster.”

Israel has vaccinated 55% of its population, the U.K. 14% and the U.S. 9.4%, against just 2.8% for the EU. At current rates, only two members, Malta and Romania, will have immunized one-third of their population by the end of the year, according to a Jan. 29 report by UBS.

With Europe’s vaccine drive struggling to keep up with infections, voters are growing impatient, adding pressure on governments already made unpopular by a year of on-again, off-again lockdowns, a stubborn infection surge and the daily litany of thousands of deaths.

Under fire, the EU has imposed a potential export ban on vaccines while opposition politicians across the bloc are talking of nationalizing manufacturers.

Yet many of the European Union’s difficulties seem to be self-inflicted, according to dozens of health experts, pharmaceutical executives and EU and national-government officials familiar with the negotiations.

While other governments were wooing vaccine makers with subsidies and immunity from liability in case of side effects, the EU focused on pushing prices down and slowing negotiations, which resulted in late orders. It also spread its purchases widely to reduce risk, signing deals with companies that are still months away from approved shots. And it was slow to authorize the vaccines it had purchased.

As a result, vaccination campaigns in the EU started late and were vulnerable to manufacturing hiccups. In January, the makers of all vaccines approved for use in the EU— [Pfizer](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PFE) Inc. and [BioNTech SE](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BNTX), [Moderna](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MRNA) Inc. and [AstraZeneca](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AZN) PLC—announced [cuts in deliveries because of manufacturing bottlenecks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/europeans-clash-with-pfizer-biontech-over-covid-19-vaccine-deliveries-11611182655?mod=article_inline), forcing governments to slow or pause vaccinations.

Critics of the EU’s approach said the problems began last June, when the European Commission took over an effort by Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy to jointly negotiate with vaccine manufacturers—an initiative that was already behind those in the U.S. and Britain. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, reeling from earlier criticism when Berlin had halted shipments of protective equipment on their way to hard-hit countries, backed the move.

But negotiating vaccine purchases wasn’t something the commission had done previously. Its main role is to draft European legislation that it submits to member states for approval. “They are not used to being so hands-on,” an official from a large EU state said.

So the commission took the playbook it knew, that of bare-knuckle trade negotiations that can take months, even years to conduct. It approached the vaccine talks as an exercise in extracting the best-possible deal, not the fastest, said an EU official briefed on the negotiations.

The commission named Sandra Gallina, a veteran trade official, as its negotiator. Beyond keeping vaccines inexpensive, her goal was to ensure companies would retain liability should the shots cause side effects, according to officials and industry executives involved. Unlike the U.S. and the U.K., the EU and its member states offered limited subsidies to vaccine developers to speed up research, expand manufacturing and lock in priority deliveries.""",Earth,/r/europe/comments/lbcx8b/how_europe_tripped_in_covid19_vaccine_race/glt9nol/,bob742omb,1612318207

Several other countries seem to have had little or no infrastructure beforehand for doing this and some were a bit late with corona-vaccine plans, too.

Regardless, EU countries are still in the very beginning with the first vaccines only a bit more than a month ago; it's entirely expected that there would be some early issues that need to be solved.

When it comes to children of cronies however, it is wrong to target them purely on the basis of that relationship. If they have done wrong and become one of Putin's cronies, then by all means do them, but I'm uncomfortable with going after family members who have done nothing wrong.

&gt;1941 m. rugpjūčio 3 d. Laikinoji vyriausybė paskyrė Šiaulių apskrities viršininku. Jisai rugpjūčio 22 d. pasirašė įsakymą, kuriuo Žagarėje buvo įsteigtas žydų getas. Joniškio burmistras Antanas Gedvilas vykdė Jono Noreikos įsakymą savo miesto žydus perkelti į Žagarę. Į Joniškį atvažiavo sunkvežimis kareivių, kurie sušaudė 300 žydų, o kitus išvežė į Žagarė, kur juos kiek vėliau sušaudė. Rugsėjo pabaigoje Jonas Noreika patenkino Antano Gedvilo prašymą atleisti jį iš pareigų. Pokario metais sovietinė propaganda šiuos aktus ir įvykius sureikšmino, paskelbusi, kad J. Noreika prisidėjo prie žydų genocido. Jisai priklausė Lietuvių nacionalistų partijai.

He was assigned as Šiauliai municipality head by the June uprising government. He did sign an order by which a ghetto was established in Žagarė, but it was probably already under german military government.

&gt;Veiklos pabaiga 1941 m. rugpjūčio 5 d. Vyriausybė sustabdė savo veiklą prieš savo ir tautos valią.

Yes, by the 5th of august the June uprising government announced its own end. On 22nd Noreika signed the order of creating the ghetto. Then a truck of soldiers came and took away the jews to be shot.

I will agree that this doesn't seem entirely not guilty, but why did he then since 1942 became active in anti-nazi resistance? At 1943 he was arrested by gestapo and was sent to Stutthof concentration camp.

&gt;1942 m. jis įsitraukė į antinacistinę veiklą, vadovavo rezistencinei pogrindžio kovai Žemaitijoje. Už tai 1943 m. vasario 23 d. Gestapo areštuotas ir uždarytas į Štuthofo koncentracijos lagerį.

He was in the concentration camp until the war ended. After the war he even had a chance to go the west, but he allowed himself to be captured by the soviet forces, went through their interrogations and came back to Lithuania. There he sought contact with lithuanian resistance and he got it. He helped organize the organization and communication between different regional units. An interesting note, his created organization ultimate goal was a free and democratic Lithuania. Not much of a nazi, is he. On 1946 he was arrested together with his wife.

Western style trebuchets are thought to have been used by the mongols against the song in the 13th century. Brought there by muslim siege engineers, with the express purpose of defeating the stone walls of major cities.

At the end of the day, this alt history is pointless. It took the mongols nearly 100 years to conquer all of china, and that was close to home.

4491,"I think this things don't explain why Germany goes through with it at all cost. This is since a long time not about the amount of money we pay to Russia. How much is it? Last time i looked it was less then 20 Billions. So if we paid double the amount for our gas it would be still not enough to bankrupt us. **The idea that his is about saving some money is just bullshit.**

If we look cool-headed at the situation you'll see there is in reality no other choice for Germany. There is just no other viable source for gas.

* LNG, the great miracle is nothing but a joke. We need more about 1000 times more gas then all LNG tankers on earth could provide. We need 86 Billion m³NG. All LNG tankers in the world can only provide \~110 Million m³ NG(converted from LNG). So to get them this entire worlds tanker fleet would need to dock 3 times a day in Germany. And this is only Germany. So how is this even considered relevant? Either i'm doing the math wrong or this argument is just a empty shell.
* Gas fields in Norway and England are about to deplete.
* A pipeline to Qatar(as planned) is impossible thanks to wars everywhere.

So how in the world could we provide the Gas? A gas outage would hit our entire industry heavily and i don't even start with the 50% of our private households who are heated with gas.

Reality is: we have no other choice for the next 15-20 years. Until then renewables are hopefully able to replace gas.",Franconia,/r/europe/comments/la7t09/nord_stream_2_russian_pipeline_is_germanys/glsdssn/,lmolari,1612303373

The reason the 1/2 dose happened was the original batches from Italy (which was doing an amazing job manufacturing) had a blip and doses were double strength, so when checking with the regulatory body, they said 1/2 it but then subsequent batches had been sorted.

&amp;#x200B;

The cash he raised is a drop in the ocean compared to the vast NHS budget, and is for NHS charities. They buy nice things for NHS staffrooms, snacks, tea breaks and the like. There are a multitude of charities that do likewise for other parts of the public sector. I work in the armed forces and a charity came in and decked out our crewroom in lovely furniture and a big TV. This arguably is not within the remit of the core MOD budget.

Immigrants, especially non EU, while for a while welcomed - at least officially by governments - are sometimes not allowed to work (like asylium seekers) and if they get asyllium, they depend on government hand outs. Also while countries claim and try to incorporate the new immigrants into culture, there's a pushback from both sides, which fuels exclusion, limits actual chances on job markets, increases nationalism (on both sides) and further fuels exclusions.

4662,"I read something on tagesschau (or something similar, don't remember correctly) that only about 29% of AfD voters are actually right wing. 

So there is 71% of people that are probably just dissatisfied with their situation or some bullshit topic like refugees where they only know half truths and unfortunately lack the mental ressources to get a real opinion for. 

I think with Söder as the candidate for the Union quite some fraction of those 71% could be turned. It's not that I am a fan of the CSU, quite the contrary, but I firstly do not think that Robert Habeck would be a capable chancellor (especially in a post-crisis time), which seems to be the only alternative to a Union chancellor in a red-red-green coalision, and I think that a CSU chancellor might actually be able to kill the AfD. Maybe that is just daydreaming, but I think lots of those AfD voters are just confused and unfortunately not very bright conservatives and if any party has the reach to get them back it is the CSU. 

Also Söder has showed his willingness to work with the greens in a black-green government, which would probably be the best for everyone including the dying SPD. Laschet just categorically dismissed the chance on a black-green cooperation and only wants to work with the FDP.

My biggest fear is that Spahn started this romance with Laschet because he knew that Laschet would not be popular enough to become chancellor. So Laschet might propose Spahn as the Union candidate, because apparently that dude can do whatever the fuck he wants and stays somehow popular with some people.",,/r/europe/comments/laay4t/german_election_2021_insa_poll_fieldwork_29_jan_1/glrcija/,nearlylostyouthere,1612288767

There is a large walkway running on all four sides of the Sanctum. Essentially, there is a lot of space in the temple.

Also, ""Gopurams"" (the tower like structure you see in the picture) are present on all four sides of the temple to mark the entrances. IMO this is what OP refers to with the term ""proper"", since you do not see this architecture a lot with other temples.

&gt; In this case, Astra Zeneca should not have signed a contract with the EU that has a delivery scheme, lists the plants in the UK as possible production sites (section 5.4) and states that they are not in conflicting contractual obligations (section 13.1.e).

Why not?

FWIW, the plants in the UK are listed only in point 5.4 and it's expressly stated only for the purpose of that point - subsequent orders, not the initial delivery. So that point of the AZ-UK contract is totally immaterial. The UK location was never supposed to manufactured to the EU at this point and that's why it's only part of section 5.4 and not section 5.1.

Not really sure what is the conflicting contractual obligation. The UK also had delays re: to the contract; just like other countries and other vaccine producers had. 

That's to be expected. 

The only reason the EU delays are so impactful is that instead of signing their contracts earlier - allowing manufacturing glitches to be sorted out - they did it later. The US and the UK invested 7 more times per capita in vaccine development and procurement than the EU Comisssion.

The economy has never emerged from a recession so indebted before, typically downturns lead to deleveraging, not so this time as every company that wasn't able to carry on as normal through this will emerge up to their fucking neck in debt. That has serious implications for the long term viability of a huge percentage of businesses. 

We haven't felt the unemployment shock yet because a) furlough schemes, which will ends soon, and b) the businesses that would ordinarily be laying people off right now are being kept alive by artificial means. As mentioned a fraction of these will go belly up in the next year or so, and with them all of their employees. 

Keeping the schools closed for long periods of time has considerable consequences for future productivity, every month spent at home represents lost future potential output and earnings. We are permanently handicapping a generation.

This is a moot point. Bosnians, Serbs and Croatians speak a language much closer than Vlach/Romanian but we call it separate languages. If the Vlach insist their language is theirs then it is what is. 

As far as the president is concerned, you got that info wrong. Novica Janošević is the president and he is a Vlach. Main efforts of the body are to distance themselves from Romanization, promote pre-1878 history of Vlachs and keep their language separate from Romanian - which is something Serbia does recognize. There's a reason first Vlach alphabet was made in Serbia and assimilation is not one of them. To me, it looks more like Romania is the one trying to assimilate Vlachs who have created their own political/cultural identity through centuries of political isolation from Romanian motherland much like Montenegro did from Serbia.",,/r/europe/comments/l9z3p5/romania_bans_chinese_companies_from_participating/glqu42g/,zperic1,1612281936

After several weeks, Mongol leaders began negotiations with the Poles, who were commanded by a man named Piotr of Krepa. Ruthenian princes, which took part in the siege, advised Piotr of Krepa to accept Mongol offers, and abandon Sandomierz, in exchange of safe passage for all residents of the city. Finally, facing hunger and epidemics, the Poles left Sandomierz on February 2, 1260; the Mongols broke their promise and massacred the civilians and the defenders. The city itself was looted and burned to the ground.

&gt;WELT: The EU Commission negotiated relatively low prices for the vaccines on behalf of the member states: Did you save at the expense of fast delivery?  
&gt;  
&gt;Von der Leyen: We invested 2.7 billion euros to increase the companies' capacities for vaccine development and, in doing so, assumed the entrepreneurial risk: Thanks to this money, the preparation was already available in December. Now the payments from the individual governments for the supplies are flowing. The sums involved are enormous. **It's true that other countries started emergency approvals a few weeks earlier, but we've chosen not to take any shortcuts. We wanted the Medicines Agency EMA to be convinced of the safety of the products: Injecting a biological substance into a healthy body is an enormous responsibility, and I am convinced that it was the right decision to use it three or four weeks longer waiting for approval.**

Absolute failure in doing that. It turns out, competition is great to find the best approach and then everybody can copy that.

5019,"&gt;I made it more explicit here than it would be in real life, but that is how it would work in reality. And a good word may mean much or not much. It could be the building permit that gets a higher priority after you went golfing with the relevant supervisor. It could be a loan application that is looked at more favourably.

The difference there is that a good word 'can't' generally get a building permit a higher priority (because the processes tend to be non-discretionary and the people involved in the process are disconnected from approvals and applications).

I mean I could try and bribe my local building control, but it would have to be extremely blatant and so likely to be identified and acted on.  Same goes with loan applications, simply picking out an application and treating it differently would be massively problematic simply because it pops so many flags around money laundering and so on. It's hard (not impossible obviously..) to have that sort of influence in formalised processes and where individuals have little personal power to act in isolation of others.

In short it is the ability to dishonestly provide an expedited service in almost every instance. The person you discuss your loan with at the bank can't authorise the loan or prioritise it, at best they might be able to chase on your behalf (the same applies to building control..), and the special treatment is then exceptionally limited and so worth less.

Bribes work when you have someone (or a group..) you can provide a benefit to so that they act against the interests of whoever they work for and in yours. That almost certainly exists everywhere, but it is much, much harder (especially at a 'retail' level) to achieve if there isn't a single person or tight group that can act.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/ladvnp/of_households_that_have_paid_a_bribe_in_the_last/glpywd0/,-ah,1612267477

5054,"&gt;Is the average Briton that deficient in mental agility that they are accusing the EU of vaccine nationalism (""How dare they to restrict exports"") while at the same time accusing the EU of too little vaccine nationalism (""British factories should supply Britain. It's your fault for not taking similar meassures"").

That's not the position at all.

The UK position is that if countries paid in advance to create the capacity to manufacture vaccines, they are entitled to them. The location of the factories is immaterial.

The UK paid for vaccine manufacturing capacity to be built in the UK. The UK will not export those vaccines to other countries until we have spare capacity.

The UK paid Pfizer to create manufacturing capacity in the EU. The UK expects to receive those vaccines.

The UK is not claiming the right to hijack production from other countries orders.

The EU was claiming the right to production capacity in the UK that the UK had paid for, on the basis that the capacity they had paid for in the EU was still not up to speed. 

The UK policy does not result in other countries getting less vaccine. The vaccine the UK receives was produced as a result of the UK orders. It's in addition to vaccines produced for the EU.

The EU policy would result in the UK getting less vaccine. It would take production that existed because the UK paid for it and reallocate it to the EU. 

The UK paid up front for vaccine production. The EU delayed, paid late, and claims they have the right to production capacity other countries paid for to try to overcome the resulting delay in their orders being fulfilled.",,/r/europe/comments/l9z75d/coronavirus_biontechpfizer_pledges_75_million/glpptjj/,WhiteSatanicMills,1612259851

If they did cut the flow, then the EU would have no choice but to back Ukraine against Russia to protect its fuel supply.  But if there is a second pipeline, then they can cut the flow of the one going through Ukraine.  THIS IS WHY RUSSIA WANTS NORD STREAM 2.

Ukraine is not in a position to import LNG.  And Russia has tried to fuck with Ukraine using gas before. [https://www.msn.com/en-my/news/other/russia-halts-gas-supply-to-ukraine/ar-AA1NUHz?pfr=1](https://www.msn.com/en-my/news/other/russia-halts-gas-supply-to-ukraine/ar-AA1NUHz?pfr=1)

Germany is already importing gas, I am not saying suddenly stop overnight.  But the smart thing to do is realize that it needs to be replaced and to take actions to do so.  LNG and gas can both be replaced, just as whale oil was replaced.  

Geothermal is huge already in Munich and in a number of other cities to provide hot water and heating.  Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings can be combined with more geothermal systems to reduce the use of gas and oil for heating.  60C is more than enough for district heating systems.  [https://www.kraftanlagen.com/en/projects/district-heating-supply-in-munich/](https://www.kraftanlagen.com/en/projects/district-heating-supply-in-munich/)

5134,"Although the EU household saving rate decreased in the third quarter of 2020, it was still +4.5 percentage points (pp) higher than it was one year ago.

The main reason for the year-on-year increase is that the household final consumption expenditure was still 3.6% lower in the EU than it was one year ago. Household gross disposable income recovered and was 1.5% higher in the third quarter of 2020 (compared with the third quarter of 2019).

Compared with the third quarter of 2019, the household saving rate increased in all Member States (for which data are available) in the third quarter of 2020. The highest year-on-year increase was observed for the Netherlands (+7.9 pp), followed by Denmark (+7.7 pp).

In most of the countries, however, the year-on-year increase was lower than it was the previous quarter. This is because household individual consumption expenditure recovered from the previous quarter, though it was still lower than it was one year ago in all Member States but two (Poland +3.8% and Portugal +0.2%).

I will not reply after this, it s pointless.

Not one of the communist experiemnts worked, all of the countries that implementeded it, they used oppresion and force to have their will. you say i'm close minded, I say you are naive.

Capitalism is not a governing system, it's an economic one, this is why China is both communist and capitalist at the same time.

You might laugh but i did read das kapital and the communist manifesto and they are mostly bullshit... again ,they describe a system where human nautre is mostly ignored. They try to account for greed but they fail to implement checks and balances, the ones rhat are implemented in strong democracies.

Regardless, this discussion is pointless, yoy can only argue hypothesis since reality is really working against your argument, therefore it has no value.

You can argue the finer points until the world ends, but the fact is that the base structure of communism allows for the few to control the many, and in no way you can get the few to redistribute fairly and equally.(same applies to unregulated capitalism.

5157,"Well, I assume that you meant that there's no environmentally friendly maintenance and production of the equipment needed to extract energy because solar, wind, and hydro are indeed clean *sources.* You can't get any cleaner *source.* Until nuclear fusion power becomes the reality at least, this is our best bet on sustainability, regardless of the cost it takes to initialise and maintain the production of energy.

Don't know why do you think recycling is a problem of some sort.

The other thing is moral question: since we've created ourselves a world where we need energy and it won't go away anytime soon, can we say that accidental deaths of a very very small percentage of animals (like you said birds, bats, water animals) justify our need for energy production? IMO, yes, because we, just as other animals, need to survive and because of the above reasons, we mostly need energy for that. 

Your example with 1 car, 1 solar plant and 300 mills (I suppose you meant mills, as wind mills to produce energy) is a nonsense. There's hundreds of millions of cars running on petrol, as well as millions of solar plants and tens of thousands of wind plants. Those plants benefits and advantages outweigh the environmental impact and disadvantages which can't be said about petroleum/coal/wood based fuel production, extraction and distribution. 

And about food production... You need to take into account the reason why it is so. And the reason is quite simple: the majority of the foods grown in the places where used to be rainforests, are fed to animals which are heavily farmed. In order to sustain animal agriculture, massive amounts of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides are used to grow their food (mostly soy beans, but also lots of corn). When we're talking about local farming, to produce food to ourselves, we're so much used to think that those chemicals are a must. And unsurprisingly, there's multiple solutions to that as well: to drastically reduce (I mean really drastically) the deforestation, land and water acidification, resources waste people need to stop consuming so much animal products because it's the #1 reason that's causing this toxic use of the land and other resources. The most optimal way to do that is to choose plants for food, in other words, to become vegan. I'm not trying to push veganism or something, it's just objectively true, a proven way that is backed by science (and no, the land and resources requirements to sustain current people population is not the same or grater that currently, it's lots and lots less). The other thing that would greatly alleviate or even eradicate land, water and air pollution is permaculture. It is a land management approach. You can read up on it in the internet. It infinitely baffles me that farmers, wanting more profits and production units, decided to use toxic chemicals to produce food and people were and still are, after so many years, OK with that.

So there you go.

Colonisations weren't done only with killings. When there were a superior culture that lived next to their city, they embraced it. Even so, all those Hitties, Luwians and Lydians came from somewhere else and settled in Anatolia and probably they ""genocided"" the people that lived there. We don't know that because they weren't the type of ""civilised"" people that kept tracks. After the Greek colonisations began, we know more stuff because there are sources that tell us.

You are accusing other people with ""violence""... Greeks invaded, Greeks raped, Greeks killed... You know the nomadic-Turkic history, right? You should read about it. Chinese even built a fucking wall so they can keep Turkish raiders out of their land. I don't think those Turkish raiders gave flowers to the Chinese farmers. We don't know how many people they killed, or raped. Or how many culture they erased from the history of the earth. Because the ancient Turkic people didn't exactly know how to write.

And as a German I basically agree and am also on the fence. From gut feeling, back then they probably shouldn't have done this deal - not worth the diplomatic fallout for example. But not finishing it now would be silly, too.

There are many different opinions within Germany, from those saying we need it to those who don't, those who say we shouldn't do it for sake of our neighbours etc. On the whole complicated mess of dependencies vis-a-vis Russian, I'd argue it's generally not a black and white thing. Being overly dependent on Russian gas seems bad indeed. Then again Russia's going to depend more on our money aswell. I always think that even when this pipeline is completed then technically it cut always be cut off?

Also last summer during the Belarus protests some expert made an interesting counter-point claiming the fact that Putin wants to complete the pipeline is probably the only reason he didn't send in his army yet... In the same manner I actually don't mind Macron calling for the project to be stopped now over Nawalny protests - in a sort of good cop bad cop kind of way. We don't have to stop it immediately but it's good that others demand it so Putin may be a little more cautious with his crackdown. All that is speculative of course.

Anyway voicing concerns like Poland and France now (and others) is totally fine. Just what the US is doing with actual sanctions is batshit crazy and inexcusable.

5264,"Not the opposite but on the fence:

From gut feeling, back then they probably shouldn't have done this deal - not  worth the diplomatic fallout for example. But not finishing it now would be silly, too.

There are many different opinions within Germany, from those saying we need it to those who don't, those who say we shouldn't do it for sake of our neighbours  etc. On the whole complicated mess of dependencies vis-a-vis Russian, I'd argue it's generally not a black and white thing. Being overly dependent on Russian gas seems bad indeed. Then again Russia's going to depend more on our money aswell. I always think that even when this pipeline is completed then technically it cut always be cut off?

Also  last summer during the Belarus protests some expert made an interesting counter-point claiming the fact that Putin wants to complete the pipeline is probably the only reason he didn't send in his army yet...  In the same manner I actually don't mind Macron calling for the project to be stopped now over Nawalny protests - in a sort of good cop bad cop kind of way. We don't have to stop it immediately but it's good that  others demand it so Putin may be a little more cautious with his crackdown. All that is speculative of course.

Anyway voicing concerns like Poland and France now (and others) is totally fine. Just what the US is doing with actual sanctions is batshit crazy and inexcusable.

5291,"Bloomberg: ""Truckers are trying to avoid the U.K. as Brexit red tape keeps them waiting to get to the continent.

New weekly data highlight the additional costs companies face when trading between Britain and the European Union after U.K. left the single market on Dec. 31. While the two sides agreed not to impose tariffs on goods, so-called non-tariff barriers are nevertheless creating obstacles for business.

Freight firms are shunning the U.K., keeping rejection rates on contracts well above the third-quarter average last week, according to high-frequency data from Transporeon, the global logistics platform. This was at least partly because haulers are being put off by delays -- the median time truckers spent in lines at Ashford, southeast England, was about 15 hours.

The cost of sending freight between the U.K. to the European Union also remained abnormally high. Stephan Sieber, chief executive of Transporeon, said this underscored that rates were not following their usual seasonal dip in the first quarter of the year. The price of shipping cargo from France to Britain was still 42% above the third-quarter average last week.

Some firms are using air instead of sea freight to circumvent delays. Mark Briffa, chief executive of private aviation group Air Partner, said about half of business in its freight division was coming from moving goods that would normally travel by sea.

“While the main industries turning to air charter are energy, automotive, aerospace and marine, we are also seeing interest from some major U.K. retailers that want to minimize disruption to their supply chains,” he said.

As firms bypassed the U.K., freight volumes on direct services from Ireland to Europe increased 100% from last year, according to the Irish government, while trade volumes between the republic and the U.K. were only half those reported in January 2020.

The situation is likely to worsen as stockpiles dwindle. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed the value of imports from the EU rose sharply in November as firms prepared for the possibility of a no-deal outcome. The trend was also encouraged by a resurgence of coronavirus cases at the end of last year that forced ports in the English Channel to close temporarily.""",,/r/europe/comments/laphde/15hour_brexit_wait_prompts_freight_firms_to_avoid/glpbkiy/,JackRogers3,1612247728

5372,"Geopolitically, it should matter to Germany if it gets its gas from the US or Russia. The US is Germany’s most important ally and only source of nuclear deterrence. Russia is the country that vassalized eastern Germany for half a century, has a track record of destabilizing and invading countries that defy Putin, and is the main reason the nuclear deterrent is needed in the first place. Making yourself reliant on your main regional adversary is just a bad call all around, as basically every country other than Germany acknowledges. 

As well, the alternatives to Russian gas really aren’t very much more expensive, if at all. US LNG prices, for example, vary widely by contract and pricing is largely opaque, but in 2019 Bulgaria supplied 10% of its natural gas needs in two shipments from the US that were priced to Bulgarian exchange levels. At worst, it may be 30% more expensive, on average, than Russian gas (this is according to the Russian energy minister, who obviously has an interest in dissuading countries from American gas), which is still very cheap as the ongoing US-Russian gas price war has resulted in the lowest gas prices in Western Europe since 2010. Even cheaper than US gas are Norwegian, Qatari, and Nigerian gas. Poland, for example, built a huge LNG terminal and will no longer be buying Russian gas once its current contracts ends, opting for US and Qatari LNG in addition to Norwegian gas going through the new Baltic pipe. France is expanding its imports from Algeria, while a new pipeline from Azerbaijan to Greece will soon supply the Balkans. 

Germany could diversity, too, if it wanted to, and it would be in its interest. I suspect at this point it’s just become a matter of sunk costs and saving face, unfortunately.",,/r/europe/comments/l9yhgp/france_urges_germany_to_scrap_russia_gas_pipeline/gloyunj/,SatoshiThaGod,1612239530

When nations need a good deal of credit, and for this or that reason wester creditors don’t wish to invest ( usually due to either regime instability or just lack of faith in being paid back), China has continually offered huge loans for things like infrastructure, and when these governments default on the loan, China usually then takes control of the said infrastructure( like some harbors in Sri Lanka and some African nations) or simply uses it to leverage influence (like how some countries like Greece and Portugal take a more pro-Sino stance in inter-EU affairs).

5471,"To a certain extent yes, although the single market in services is pretty fragmented and obviously the the vast majority of the UK's service industry doesn't export at all (and for those that do, exports are global, and the barriers to providing services to the EU remain relatively unchanged given they weren't impeded by tariff barriers at all, and didn't face NTB's). VAT might well be the biggest issue, but even that isn't particularly hard to deal with, and of course there are no other customs/ports/clearance issues thrown in.  There will be an impact, but for a lot of service providers very little will have changed.

We'll see where we land with equivalence for financial services, and how the broader services picture develops. That said, the nice thing about services is that they tend to be easier to export globally anyway, and reducing the barriers (as CPTPP does..) is pretty viable. The UK is after all quite competitive in this area.

To be honest the biggest loss in terms of the four freedoms for the UK is the loss of movement of people, but that's an issue that won't be addressed by this.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/la2781/uk_set_to_formally_apply_for_transpacific_trade/glojloa/,-ah,1612231892

I lived in Spain once, and my neighborhood was about 2000 years old and had a Roman gate and archaeological site at the entrance. There were a lot of houses from the 1700s and 1800s sitting around like it was a normal thing. There were a ton of churches from the 1600s and 1700s, and I lived in kind of a rural town.

We know we're consistently vaccinating ~11k people daily at least and then there's a few other organisations (hospitals, nursing/care home doctors) distributing vaccines. The former does their vaccination in bunches and only on a limited amount of people so they'll give the numbers a boost for a few days (like today, having vaccinated ~13k people by the looks of it) and then stay quiet for a while. And the latter is having issues reporting the data to the national government so they're not counted in the data (and the hospital counts aren't either today, but likely will be again tomorrow). The official number for Jan 31st is 1.44% vaccinated, if you add the estimate of how many the group having issues with reporting should have done it gets bumped up to 2%, but that number might be off.

5560,"&gt;What? That makes no sense. Why would anyone object to the UK giving or selling it's vaccines to the EU. 

No. No country, having had foresight and proper planning, would send crucial vaccines to a foreign entity following threats and demands

&gt;You said before that the UK would have been willing to share. Yet now you say it's unreasonable to share?

No. I said the UK could have shared if the EU had wanted the same vaccine at the same time. As we discussed and you admitted, the EU prevaricated for political reasons.

&gt;The US is paying double the price for the AZ vaccine than the EU pays. Given that they're all produced in Europe and that I'm not aware the EU invested in AZ R&amp;D, those reasons can't really explain the difference. But I've already agreed that haggling over the price was a mistake so no point in you just repeating that.

Local costs and R&amp;D or some other cost. AZ cannot make a profit

&gt;For people in the EU, the existence of the EU *is* seen as saving lives. But that's something Brits will never understand.

Rightfully never understand. The EU's actions in NI shows why

&gt;You're not making any sense anymore. First you appeared to be doubting the existence of the clause, now you're defending it. 

It is not important if it exists, and you don't know if it does. The EU's delay meant whether it exists or not the result is the same. 

&gt;No, it's not ""normal"". You don't explicitly monopolize the entire production of a *specific* plant and prohibit it from producing for other customers when ordering a certain amount of something. Most other vaccine contracts don't have that stipulation. But regardless of if it's normal, the effect is that the UK grabs all the initial production until its needs are satisfied and only then does anybody else get anything from those plants.

We are repeating. There was no other buyer at the time. There is no surplus now. The UK needs vaccine. It ordered the vaccine.

&gt;Now, that might even be good policy, I'm not denying that, but how is it not ""Trumpian nationalism"" that puts own interest ahead of everyone else?

There were no other interests. The EU didn't negotiate for those vaccines. The EU demanded it months later. That is putting self-interest above others.

&gt;Weak, very weak excuse.

You called it Trumpian. Why can't you read your own posts without asking me? Weak. And this is boring

&gt;I said it was a *possible* motivation. Is it not possible as contributing to the government's decision?

You picked the least generous reason and assumed. You ALWAYS do when it comes to the UK.

&gt;What does it matter what is it discussing? It disproves your statement that I only ascribe bad motivations to the UK gov. And do you think they actually had bad motivations there?

No. You ascribe bad motivations.  Here, for some reason, you are sanguine about UK deaths and blithely call it just a ""mistake"".

5668,"You see like many things cuisines have kept evolving as well. Like many dishes today that you probably know very well weren't existed just 100 years ago. LET ALONE 1000 years.

Also just for the correct history... Greeks have invaded AND RAPED the Asia minor NOT TURKS. Greeks have COLONIZED IT. NOT TURKS.  You see it was Greeks who genocided all Asia minor civilizations. NOT TURKS. When Turks came into Asia minor it was already ""greco-roman-christian"" identity that was existing there. All other Asia minor/Anatolian civilizations were LONG GONE. IN THE HANDS OF GREEKS. What Turks have done could be described as... they gave Asia minor it's distinct identity back. ;)

 In fact as you can see from this very thread. EVEN AFTER 500 years of TURKISH domination. Greeks still speak their language, they have their identity their religion. Or Armenians, Bulgarians, Jews, Arabs etc.etc. Because they weren't trying to assimilate them or anyone AT ALL. It was just they settled into Asia minor and mixed with the native population there. And with time everyone merged into ""Turkish"" identity. It become important AFTER the French revolution and nation-state ideologies.

I can assure you if Turks were doing the things that you say like ""raping, massacring the native populations"" YOU WOULDN'T EXIST. (assuming you are Greek but this could be said for any other ex-Ottoman ethnicity that exist and hate Turks today like Armneians)

You see you should start asking yourself then ""how come a people group who lived in huts were better than us and conquered us""....!

Also Turks have ALWAYS been minority. They were NEVER some huge population group. For example just during WW1 era in 1915 Ottoman empires population was about 18 million that's basically less than 1/3 of Germany's 1915 population btw. And only about 9 million of that 18 was Turkish. Rest was well Arabs, Greeks, Armenians etc. 

It was the same in central Asia and in Asia minor as well. Turks never had a huge population in central Asia the Oguz Turks(the branch that migrated to Asia minor/Turkey) were the western branch of Turks. Living in northern shores of Caspian sea. And when they moved to Asia-minor they mixed with the population there in upcoming MILLENIUM. Until the ideas of nationalism and nation-state has become the new norm in the world. Which ended up Turks creating Turkish state.

In fact Turks were already mixed and merged with other nomadic groups in Eurasian steppes like Scyhtians. ""Turks"" were basically the ethno-linguistic group who came on top of all other western Eurasian steppe peoples. And all of them merged into ""Turks"" with time. Except eastern steppe people aka. Mongolians. Well you probably know them from your history classes right ? 

Long story short it is true that Turks have adopted many traditions along the way from people who they lived alongside for centuries. But the thing is modern day Greeks have adopted as many if not more of the Turkish cultural things as well. You see there is no way to be not effected by ruling class culture after half a MILLENIUM.",,/r/europe/comments/la8uun/turkeys_president_erdoğan_praises_his_partys/glnmfym/,eurobiaisthebest,1612216883

Greek nobility may have had a hand on the throne, but this doesn't neglect the fact that greeks were still under foreign rulership and didnt have freedom of expression. I don't have a big knowledge of the Turkish revolts in Anatolia, but relocating is still better than genocide. Muslim turks still had religious freedom compared to christians, who had heavy restrictions on their faith. They weren't also taxed as much.

5713,"""People vaguely related to you killed some people vaguely related to me at least a century ago, for which reason you now have to slave in the fields"" is not a compelling argument.

In reality the reasons for what happened are unclear. In fact, in the 1950s-1960s - one or two decades before the Revival Process began, the Bulgarian Communist Party were promoting a lot of Turkish speakers within its ranks, with the intention of supplying the start up personnel following a communist coup in Turkey.

The sudden change from discrimination favouring Turkish Bulgarians, through throwing them in concentration camps, to strongly suggesting to them that they should emigrate to Turkey was probably mostly caused by outside factors:

- the BCP lost hope of a communist coup in Turkey, so no need to indoctrinate Turkish Bulgarians to that extent;
- then the BCP feared uprisings in general, so they threw Turkish Bulgarians in concentration camps as an example to the rest of the population;
- then the BCP feared uprising from Turkish Bulgarians specifically, so they ""allowed"" them to emigrate when emigration was highly restricted.",,/r/europe/comments/la0a9m/today_bulgaria_mourns_the_victims_of_the_1945/glnn707/,ijrq,1612217198

5787,"In 2016, Germany [imported 49.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas](https://www.eecc.eu/blog/the-effect-of-nord-stream-2-on-the-european-gas-market) from Gazprom. Statischesbundesamt publishes the latest monthly gas imports to Germany.

At the same time: 

&gt;In July the Russian Gazprom company concluded an agreement with EU energy companies, namely E.ON, Shell, OMV, and BASF/Wintershall, whereby Russia is, by 2019, is to supply an additional 55 billion m3 of gas through the Nord Stream II gas pipeline, which runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea and connects Russia and Germany.

If German [consumption](https://www.enerdata.net/estore/energy-market/germany.html) is 95 billion cubic metres in 2019, then it's not very hard to do the math.  


&gt; germany is also building LNG terminals, importing gas from elsewhere 

&amp;#x200B;

You go and do me a favour, and have a look at how much capacity German LNG terminals have. 10 billion cubic metres, maybe?  It's not bad, but German consumption is every year increasing and this is currently 1/9th of what will come from Russia. And yes, Germany is currently importing gas from Netherlands and Norway. But the poster above you notes that it plans on a halt of Norwegian deliveries, UK deliveries, and the Netherlands deliveries will cease within the next decade. So then this is the alternative. A devastating amount of gas will come from Russia and there are no contingency plans to lessen that dependency. It is only increasing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; transforming away from gas. 

Um, no, Germany is consuming every year more gas.

this is factually wrong as linguistic is a science, albeit a human one, and the majority consensus of linguists doesn't agree with the decisionss the italian parliament took in the 1940s.



linguistically speaking the galloitalic continuum, venetian, friulan, tuscan (including corsican), Mediano, Southern Italian (or Neapolitan the two naming are indifferent), Extreme-Southern (or wider Sicilian) and Sardinian are all different romance languages. the linguistic border between galloitalic and tuscan (the massa-sinigallia line) is a very strong linguistic border with dialects on the northern side sharing more with french dialects than with dialects on the immediate south of it.

when I talk about politics I mean that since the creation of italy in the 1860s and the need of unifying the language and culture of the peninsula there was the need to mimic what france did and promote standard italina against the local languages. thus calling the other languages dialects. this continued during the fascist era (obviously as fascism was strongly against local identities) and during the democratic republic era when the constitution was created.

Friulan and Sardinian (as well as Arpitan, Tyrolean Deutsch and Arbreshe) are that much different than standard italian that it was ok to recognize them (at least after the fall of fascism), moreover the people that spoke them are small in numbers. however recognizing that outside of tuscany italian wasn't the first language for the population but a lingua franca meant admitting a plurality of culture within the peninsula that was aganst the idea of national unity upon whic the state was built. that's what i mean when i talk about a political choice and not a linguistic one.

nowday that standard italian definitely won the linguistic battle (at least until it will be replaced by english) I think we can without problems recognize that italy had, and in someplaces still has, local indigenous languages alongside standard italian.",Milan,/r/europe/comments/l9d8sv/what_european_language_am_i_reading_a_flow_chart/glm2g4t/,medhelan,1612195242

Invest in building up infrastructure in the UK, Switzerland, and other viable developed economies. AZ has manufacturing for the covid vaccine in the UK, the US, and Australia, in addition to the EU. 

Building up operations in the EU was clearly the most cost-effective way to go but if the EU is going to block exports it makes more sense to diversify as much as possible, despite the more onerous costs. 

The fact is that both the pharma companies and the EU decided to concentrate investment and production in the EU because a) existing infrastructure, b) efficiency and c) because the EU was happy to be the base of global supply.

If i said that the duomo of milan has more historical value compared to the duomo of pordenone you wouldn’t say “it’s all politics”, but you feel free to say it with the minority languages. 

The treccani enciclopedia article on friulano (cercalo su google) says: “thanks to its peculiarities that make it stand out among the other northern dialects, friulano has gained the status of minority language.”

Sicily is a region at special status, but still sicilian is not officialized like sardinian, ladin and friulano. 

Friulano and ladin both belong to the retoromance branch, a really conservative branch. In fact friulano has peculiarities you don’t find in the other dialects, like the plurals in s, for example. Sardinian is even more isolated, a branch on his own.

This is due to the fact that, unlike milan or venice, central friuli, alto adige and sardinia were isolated and out of the commercial paths for a long time, so, unlike the other dialects, theirs weren’t influenced by the neighbouring dialects or by florentine italian. Even sicily, an island, was less isolated.

You can’t have both. Or a famous place at the centre of the trades, or a unique dialect.

Also, those got recognized after years and years of discussions. I’m not expert in linguistics, but i’m sure that there are divergent opinions in the community, so i think the parliament took the opinion of the majority of the linguistic community. They don’t give titles away like water.

# Net migration in selected European countries 2020

Published by [D. Clark](https://www.statista.com/aboutus/our-research-commitment), Jan 28, 2021 In 2020 Germany had the highest net migration figures in Europe at over 543 thousand people, while Romania had the lowest with negative net-migration figure of almost 74 thousand. After Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom had the second and third highest net-migration figures in that year, at 498 thousand and 260 thousand respectively.  


## Asylum applications in Europe

Germany accepted the largest number of [asylum seekers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/459815/accepted-asylum-applicants-europe-by-country/) in Europe in 2018 at 75.9 thousand, while Sweden and Belgium accepted the second and third most respectively, with roughly 10.6 and 9.7 thousand applicants each.

In the ""Belene"" concentration camp, on the island of Persin opposite the town of Belene, there wasn't anything when the prisoners were sent there. They had to build their own concentration camp, initially some holes in the ground covered with sticks and mud, and later proper buildings. There was a large pile of rocks which the prisoners had to manually move from one side of the island to the other, every day. If they couldn't move the rocks in time, they didn't get food or shelter for the night. Later on, the prisoners from Belene were used as agricultural slave labour.

EXCLUSIVE Chinese companies, excluded from tenders for highways and railways. The Government adopted a memorandum proposed by Minister Cătălin Drulă - Official

&amp;#x200B;

The government adopted a memorandum at the January 27 meeting, which provides for the exclusion of Chinese companies from infrastructure tenders, government sources told [G4Media.ro](https://G4Media.ro). The memorandum proposed by the Minister of Transport, Cătălin Drulă, will be followed by a government ordinance that will amend the public procurement law, in accordance with the directions of the European Commission. The reason? Unfair competition from Chinese state-owned companies, but also poor quality of work.

&amp;#x200B;

The memorandum adopted by the government stipulates that companies from non-EU countries can be excluded from infrastructure tenders without an agreement with the European Union that would allow them access to the European public procurement market.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE 13.31: Deputy Prime Minister Dan Barna confirmed the adoption of the memorandum and said in a press conference that the decision was taken after a discussion with the European Commission. Dacian Cioloș also confirmed the decision

UPDATE 10.18: Prime Minister Florin Cîțu declared this morning that ""there must be an emergency ordinance, you will have the information when it will happen"".

Important: according to the memorandum adopted by the government, the exclusion will apply to both future and ongoing auctions. In this case, the large Chinese state-controlled companies participating in major tenders, such as the Sibiu-Pitești Highway, the Pitești-Craiova expressway and the purchase of electric trains launched by the Railway Reform Authority, could be directly affected.

&amp;#x200B;

The memorandum does not explicitly provide for the elimination of Chinese companies from auctions, but for companies from third countries that do not have agreements for entering the European public auction market, but China is one of these countries, according to [G4Media.ro](https://G4Media.ro).

&amp;#x200B;

The draft GEO that will implement the memorandum adopted by the government will be prepared by the General Secretariat of the government and the National Agency for Public Procurement (ANAP).

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons for excluding Chinese companies from tenders in Romania are the unfair competition caused by their support by the Chinese state, the lack of approval of their products in the EU, but also the history of failed or poorly executed works in other European countries.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, several Chinese companies are involved in tenders for major infrastructure objectives in Romania. These are China Railway 14th Bureau Group, Sinohydro Corporation and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), all participants in the tenders for sections of the Bucharest ring highway, the Pitesti - Sibiu Highway and the Pitesti - Sibiu expressway, works totaling over 3.5 billion euros.

&amp;#x200B;

The Chinese contested many of the auction results, which led to the extension of the design and execution period and, implicitly, to the delay of the projects.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the CRRC Quingdao Sifang company won in front of Alstom and Siemens the tender of 1.7 billion lei for 40 electric trains, but its trains are not yet approved by the European Railway Authority (ERA). If the Chinese manufacturer does not obtain European approval within a year and a half, the Romanian state will ask the court to refund the advance and will award the contract to the second place bidder - all with a delay of many years. A new tender for another 20 electric trains launched in 2019 has been challenged by the Chinese manufacturer and will be restored after almost a year and a half.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the Ministry of Transport based on in an attempt to exclude Chinese companies from the tender? The EU legal provisions that allow such behavior are contained in the European Commission Communication no. 5494 of 2019. It states that “economic operators from third countries, which do not have an agreement providing for the opening of the EU public procurement market or whose products, services and works do not fall under such an agreement, do not have secure access to EU procurement procedures and may be excluded ”. The EU has concluded a Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) with 19 third countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Israel and Moldova, but China is not a signatory. As such, Chinese companies can be excluded from EU public tenders.

&amp;#x200B;

The Ministry of Transport claims that Chinese companies are increasingly participating in tenders for road and rail infrastructure in Romania and distort competition through dumping prices that they can afford thanks to state aid received from the Chinese government. In addition, according to the Ministry of Transport, Chinese companies do not have the certifications and approvals required by the EU, such as construction in areas protected, protection and safety of employees.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, there have been cases of bad practice in Europe by some Chinese companies involved in major infrastructure works. The best known example comes from Poland, which terminated in 2011 the contract with Covec for the construction of a large highway. The Chinese company did not have the financial capacity to support the works, despite winning the tender. Similar situations, which have led to major political scandals, have occurred in northern Macedonia and Montenegro.

6230,"We supplied them with arms and resources because they are an ally and Pro Russian. There is however a larger strategic play for Russia. By keeping the Donestk Republic forces as a forward operating base, it gives us an upper hand to ensure that Ukraine cannot join NATO, an organisation we see as a threat next to our borders.

As the conflict drags on longer, the more we'll deepen and integrate the Donestk Republic into Russia, keeping it as a forever stalemate. If Ukraine ever wants to take it back, under the false promise that the West has it's back, it will face fire and fury from the Russian forces and we'll sweep so deep that they could lose half their country, they'll have learnt that lesson from Georgia. 

Strategically speaking, Russia calls the shots on Ukraine's NATO membership and even it's EU membership. Until it comes to the table and does the following A) Drop all claims to Crimea   B) Accept autonomy fo the Donbass region  C) Sign a peace treaty where it inks that it wouldn't join NATO, then it's balls will remain in our grasp, ready to be squeezed anytime we feel it is stepping out of line.",,/r/europe/comments/la18e7/donetsk_republic_receives_first_batch_of_russias/gll9652/,thekremlinbot,1612181309

6236,"&gt;  I'm very pro-EU generally but the fact that the Commission bargained so hard and for so long is baffling.

The commission can only work with member-state approval. I am sure if they just had the dough they would've blown it all over the place, but last summer was a time when a lot of major countries (e.g. Germany) were faring very well and had absolutely no incentive to shell out massive money for the EU vaccine procurement, especially considering for Germans deficit spending is a political taboo. 

So I don't know how it's the EU's fault when 27 member states all meddle with the process, are reluctant to give money, and try to warp the process in their nation's favor (e.g. France and Sanofi).",The Lux in BeNeLux,/r/europe/comments/l9z75d/coronavirus_biontechpfizer_pledges_75_million/gll97lt/,Priamosish,1612181340
