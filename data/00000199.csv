I was in shanghai and given a blank map maybe 2 out of 10 people knew where it was - like the right area - people pointed to Hainan, Taiwan, Japan.

102,"Alright, I tried the challenge another American posted somewhere in this thread, saying that Europeans couldn't find Laos, Lesotho, or Louisiana on a map.

On the one hand, he was right: I failed the challenge... but on the other hand, I tried this on Google Maps in satellite mode without borders or labels (you can only see the terrain), and for all three countries/states I was within 20-30 miles of the border. 

There's room for improvement, sure. But with borders, I would have found all three. I suspect I could find ~75% of the US states with the same accuracy, and some of the rest I would get mixed up. Geography was my worst subject in school.

That doesn't say anything about Americans being dumb (that's just silly, many of the people I admire most were born there or moved there); it only says that on average, Europeans learn more about world geography in school. That's something that could be improved.

A couple of weeks ago, I saw a vid of a 4-year-old American kid who could point to every country you told him on a world map, and then even name its capital.

165,"&gt; Trump high approval rate has definitely something to do with low unemployment and the economy

While America does have low national unemployment and a strong economy, a closer look will reveal a lot of the jobs cannot sustain cost of living. And many people have to work more than one job just to pay the bills. The top 10% of Americans are enjoying the booming economy, while everyone else either has stagnating or declining standard of living. Additionally, the lack of a decent national health insurance, especially for optional procedures that really are not optional in the long run, is hurting many. On top of that the rural family held farms are devastated, and many rural areas have high unemployment due to the post industrial changes the past generation

The high approval for Trump, the increased fascism, and a growing xenophobia is being fed by a quiet sense of desperation. But, it is true.

I think the later is actually the bigger issue. If somebody like the queen came in who quite legally and rightfully probably still has the powers to do this. It could result in wide spread civil unrest if the people do not agree with the decision.

The 2nd part of this problem is that there is no correct decision to be made by anyone since the country is so split so either way its going to be seen as pissing of 30-50+% of the population which ever choice is made. Its the real reason why the deal and brexit is such a mess. May has approached it trying to make too many people happy and result of course being failing everyone.

Even if the queen did do something this is like jumping into the USA system and giving free health care to all, raising taxes and banning guns at the same time saying the decision is final...

238,"Here in the realm of reddit, I would rather say your stance is the populist one.   
\- Solar and wind is full multiples cheaper than nuclear, so you actually can spend a lot of money on storage and still be cheaper without nuclear.  
\- Storage isn't needed, before you have 50-60% renewables in your mix (At least that is true for germany). Can be furthered, if energy sharing between all european countries is heavily implemented.  
\- Nuclear would be needed to run with lower tan max capacity to fill the fluctuation gaps by solar and wind. Makes nuclear actually more expensice, because the cost is largely due to the building, maintenance etc. and not so much due to the spend fuel. Which results in an even higher price gap, where it would make sense to build storage.  
\- It is likely, that when there is really storage needed in the grid, that the price gap between nuclear and solar/wind is even more massive  
\- Why the fuck, would you store a countries worth of energy for a month long stretch?! Do you have any calculations to show that time frame/needed storage capacity?

I am also a fervent pro-eu and pro-brexit citizen simply because the EU needs to get rid of its toxic member, which is completely delusional about its importance, strength and influence.

The damage will be economically significant in the short and medium term, but the political gain will potentially be enormous.

The more I spoke with him, the more I realised *he thought he was going to arrive to* ***find Ireland still suffering from post-famine conditions as in 1850s.*** 

I wish I was making this up. Just like your acquaintance, he was surprised to discover we had electricity, ""cable"" and the internet. He asked how old my house was and I said ""well it was built in the '50"" and he goes ""Ah, the ***18***50s!"" ""...No"" says I. Like, we're literally standing across the road from houses built in the late 00s with modern architecture. 

He then said something about how he thought Ireland was dirt poor and I had to explain what the Celtic Tiger had been.  To be honest at this point I was getting a tad insulted and could feel myself getting red in the face so, to maintain politeness, I wrapped things up. 

And for anyone thinking ""Ahhh, He was taking the piss/pulling your leg, he had to have been"", I didn't get the vibe at all. There was no ""Hey, I'm only kidding"" moment and he didn't have the demenor at all of someone who'd do that kind of humour.

300,"Actually im pretty confident that the amount of religious people, especially deeply religious people, are rising these days in Scandinavia, as a result of the high amount of immigrantion from the middle east and Africa. These are much more religious areas, and they generally have much more radical and strict religions, in the form of Islam typically.

The percentage of the population in Scandinavian countries from these regions is exponentially increasing. The first generations immigrants already make up 13% and 20% in Denmark and Sweden respectively, and it's not slowing down. It's predicted by population development studies that etnic Swedes will be a minority in Sweden around 2050.

So with that in mind I think it's safe to say that Scandinavia is becoming more religious than it has been previously, as seen from the resurgence of the construction of countless religious buildings in recent years, nearly entirely in the form of mosques.

**Edit:** I see this comment is viewed as controversial. **I urge people to actually look this up themselves if they doubt it, as what I'm saying is truthful.** This is truthful and not meant to be offensive, but I do know that anything that isn't politically correct is silenced today, regardless of whether or not it's factual.

""Lost names"" are a pretty interesting topic. 

In Germany, that practise of continuing to hold a name in order to not let it become extinct developed into ""*genannt*"" names (literally meaning ""called-names""). The most famous example of this is probably [Erich von Manstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Manstein), whose proper legal name was *Erich von Lewinski genannt von Manstein*. 

In his particular case, they did it by way of adoption, which is the 'clean' way to do it. Other names, though, just require that someone adopts the name which otherwise would become extinct and add it via ""genannt"".

321,"You are dodging the main issue, and that issue is that capitalism does not offer incentives to be productive. Capitalism pays better for having money than for being productive. You can earn about what a Portuguese worker earns an entire year by investing in no risk investments the modest quantity of 1 million euros and getting a modest 1% return on your investment. He worked 40 hours a week, giving up much of the meaning of life to generate his boss' wealth. You put in a quick call to your account manager. Apparently, you are more productive than him, by the mere virtue of having accumulated capital, quite likely off the back of many workers like him.

That the riches commonly generated by the working class have an owner who is willing to let prospective rich class wannabes use it to accumulate their own wealth, while keeping the same system of exploitation in place, is not a saving grace.

Accumulating a lot of money and then claiming you are ""productive"" because you let others pay you to temporarily use it is not fair. I am not objecting that this is the way things work: I'm stating the obvious unfairness of such a system.

382,"&gt;It shouldn't be hard to figure that europe ends with the west chunk of russia;

The line delineating Asian-Russia from European-Russia is literally just an arbitrary vertical line on a random part of the map. That's not something anyone can ""figure out"" *at all*, it simply has to be taught.

&gt;And come on, Kazakhstan? That's obviously Asia

Why is that ""obvious""?

&gt;If americans get ridiculed for sometimes lacking geographical knowledge, then only because we rate the US higher than that.

This is what I mean by Eurocentrism. It's as if you expect that any ""highly rated"" person will -- *of course* -- know all about your super important center-of-the-world geography. But it isn't like that at all. European geography simply isn't that relevant to those who don't live in Europe, whether they live in the US, China, or Lesotho. It might be interesting trivia, but lacking the information about distant geographies is very unlikely to be an impediment to absolutely anything any of us ever need to do in our lives. And with the advent of technology that makes knowledge instantly accessible, it's even less important than before that an average person commit to memory the geographical and political boundaries of far-flung corners of the world.

There's a difference between ""decriminalizing cannabis"" and ""legalizing cannabis"". If cannabis is decriminalized it means you won't go to prison, you won't have a permanent record, and you will not have your life permanently ruined. You can still however be fined, and there many not be any legal way for you to obtain any.

If cannabis is legalized, then you can go grow some and sell it, or buy it at the nearest tobacco shop and smoke it in full view of a police officer.


Same here. They're not saying ""it's perfectly fine to beat your wife"", but ""If you commit violence against your wife, and it's the first time, and it's not severe, you'll get a fine instead of being prosecuted"".

However there are plenty of people who voted to remain who oppose further integration, and federalisation.

I see no reason why this shouldn't apply to other countries. Although none are as anti-EU, or at least anti-increased intra-EU integration as the UK, plenty of polls suggest that most if not all countries have less than 50% of their population who support federalisation.

2) Because electric cars so far are mostly still seen as for ""the elite"", auto manufacturers aren't really throwing themselves on the smaller car market and thus most electric cars are of the more luxurious type.

Poland has some areas with decent wind potential, and they do get the same amount of sun as Germany. Alternatively, they could invest in nuclear power like France did. They could increase energy imports, and investment into better energy grids is vital anyway so all of Europe can transport energy from where there is excess (a place having a particularly windy day, for example) to places where it is needed. 

There is even a chance that Poland could use Carbon Capture &amp; Storage (CCS) which would allow for them to continue to use coal, but claiming to use that is an empty promise unless they actively invest in the technology and require any new plants to use it.

&gt; These protests are spreading to other counties and their message is being heard all around the world. How effective do you think it would have been if they just stood in some plaza legally, for 30 minutes, not saying anything. There are protests every day around the world, and theirs is on every single TV globally. 

And what is the message, exactly? Go on a rampage until the government bends the knee?

&gt; Hell there are Gilets Jaunes people that are protesting silently, and are not doing anything, but guess what you’re not hearing about it because it’s a shitty tactic. 

And this is a big problem, in my opinion. They consist of members with tons of different viewpoints. How do you expect Macron to appeal to EVERY ONE of them? What if the members are pushing complete opposite demands and Macron can't just make one thing happen without upsetting the other half and causing... more violence!

And I've checked and couldn't find ANY demands they made. And it doesn't help that [they have no leader](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46424267), or if they're implying even more havoc:

&gt; ""We don't want anyone using our movement, and we don't want leaders,"" said Frank Buhler, a prominent member of the gilets jaunes. ""We have to start all over again, that's how far we've come. **The French Revolution started with flour wars; for us it's fuel taxes.**""

OF COURSE violence is the quickest and easiest way to get attention, but how come everyone's not using it in their day-to-day lives? If bread is too expensive, why not just steal it and point a weapon at someone who disagrees?

I'm not from Lisbon, sometimes people seem to forget that there are tax paying Portuguese citizens living outside Lisbon and Porto. The last decade has been marked by the decline of my region due to decisions forced on us by the government in Lisbon.

I can't deal with his attitude in general, if you pay close attention to him in the *Assembleia* he's always laughing to side, especially when somebody from the opposition is speaking. I know he's probably not alone at that, but as a PM he should know better.

So, as I said before, you don't know what you talk about, that's why you think as you think. You see, ""Domestic violence"" is one article being decriminalized and what we discuss is a husband leaving a bruise on his wife or parents, or children for this sake. There's also other criminal code articles that weren't criminalized. One of them is ""Murder attempt"" (or something like that threats of death fall into). Another one ""Intentional bodily harm"" and ""Intentional grievous bodily harm"".

So the one who would threaten their parents as you describe would go to far away places for long time. Another aspect of criminal cases is that they cannot be ignored. At least that's how it works in Russia, I don't know much about other countries' law systems. If you committed a crime, the state can't not process that, because there is no such a thing as ""mutual consent"".

800,"&gt;Of the 6063 families in the UK Millennium Cohort study at 3 years who met our inclusion criteria, 844 (14%) had a new transition into poverty compared with 5219 (86%) who remained out of poverty. After adjustment for confounders, transition into poverty increased the odds of socioemotional behavioural problems in children (odds ratio 1·41 [95% CI 1·02–1·93]; p=0·04) and maternal psychological distress (1·44 [1·21–1·71]; p&lt;0·0001). Controlling for maternal psychological distress reduced the effect of transition into poverty on socioemotional behavioural problems in children (1·30 [0·94–1·79]; p=0·11).

It looks like here the real villian is maternal psychological distress, which looks like it is caused by the move into relative poverty. But controlling for that gives us a p value of 0.11 where we would accept the null hypothesis for not having a negative impact on mental health for children as its greater than 0.05. Been a while since I did stats but I believe that's correct. 

So what does this tell us, as you get less money maternal psychological distress increases. Well of course, that would definitely be expected, and that in turn affects negatively the mental health of children. But it doesn't actually directly affect the mental health of children. What needs to be addressed here isn't the 'relative poverty', its the maternal distress.

Further, there is no justification for the 60% of median income being the relative poverty golden point. If there was something saying that this is a particularly interesting tipping point where nutrition, maternal health, education starts taking a massive hit then I would understand. But it isn't, that figure would be like 47.856% or something, 60% seems to have come from thin air.

842,"Constitutional law is just law which defines how the state operates. It doesn't matter how hard it is to amend.

The UK  is built upon hundreds of years' worth of constitutional conventions. Consensus is a powerful phenomenon which can enforce ideas without needing courts.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_conventions_of_the_United_Kingdom

It is important to notice that parliamentary sovereignty makes it almost impossible for something like the American Constitution to be made in the UK.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty#England_and_the_UK_generally

&gt; However, there is a distinction to be made between legal sovereignty and political sovereignty. Parliament is not politically sovereign, which means that if Parliament passes unpopular or oppressive legislation, then it may not be applied in practice; for example, the various civil servants who administer laws within government departments may be relied upon to use any loopholes and vague language which exists in a Bill to get around unwanted areas, and the judiciary is likely to purposefully interpret and create precedent for said laws in a similar manner. However this does not necessarily mean that Parliament is not legally sovereign. It is argued that nonetheless Parliament can legally pass any legislation it wishes. This point is made clearly by Lord Reid in Madzimbamuto v Lardner-Burke [1969] 1 AC 645:

&gt;It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United Kingdom Parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and other reasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it as highly improper if Parliament did these things. But that does not mean that it is beyond the power of Parliament to do such things. If Parliament chose to do any of them, the courts would not hold the Act of Parliament invalid.

In a way, the British constitution puts more power into the public's hands than the American constitution. A great example is the banning of handguns in response to the Dunblane massacre.

Oh sure, nuclear is not the end-all solution to energy really. But thing is, at this very moment when we've got 3 decades of time to get rid of fossil fuel emission completely, nuclear is the one technology that we have that can be built to produce the amounts of energy needed that cannot be produced with renewables.

To meet the 2050 zero emission goal, the only feasible way right now is to: use renewables wherever possible, and then replace the rest of the fossil fuels with nuclear.

100 % renewables is of course the ideal state to strive for, but because of significant challenges to solve in both the ways electrical grids work, namely base load (you can adjust the output of a nuclear reactor if demand rises, you cannot increase/decrease the output of renewables easily), and problems to be solved on the storage capacity side for renewables, 100 % renewables is not something we can realistically hope to achieve by 2050.

If it's deflationary, harms the economy, and harms demography, then why do the most neoliberal countries have better monetary policy, better economies, and better demographics? The US and Ireland for example have had higher GDP growth and higher birth rates than the more heavily regulated countries of Europe for decades now. Italy, probably the least neoliberal country in I've ever been to, has had lackluster growth and aging demography for a long time.

Criminal cases demand long processing by different instances, a lot of paperwork, they include giving severe punishment (years of life) to a person found guilty and stigmatization for life.

There is also probability b for any of these events to be turned into a criminal case that is a product of: probability c of a victim of violence to report the crime knowing it will lead to a prison term, probability d of local police to accept the report, probability e of the state prosecutor to start a case and bring it to a court.

I am not saying I like religious fundamentalism or anything stupid like that but science functionally tells you nothing about how you *should* behave, only the probable outcomes of certain interactions and how the world appears to work.

Indeed doggedly promoting science and evolution to the status of a pseudo religion is a fantastic way to end up with ideologies of genetic supremacy as people internalise ""winning evolutionarily"" as the ultimate goal of life.

1342,"&gt; COPENHAGEN — Denmark plans to house the country’s most unwelcome foreigners in a most unwelcoming place: a tiny, hard-to-reach island that now holds the laboratories, stables and crematory of a center for researching contagious animal diseases.
&gt; 
&gt; As if to make the message clearer, one of the two ferries that serve the island is called the Virus.
&gt; 
&gt; “They are unwanted in Denmark, and they will feel that,” the immigration minister, Inger Stojberg, wrote on Facebook.
&gt; 
&gt; On Friday, the center-right government and the right-wing Danish People’s Party announced an agreement to house as many as 100 people on Lindholm Island — foreigners who have been convicted of crimes and rejected asylum seekers who cannot be returned to their home countries.
&gt; 
&gt; The 17-acre island, in an inlet of the Baltic Sea, lies about two miles from the nearest shore, and ferry service is infrequent. Foreigners will be required to report at the island center daily, and face imprisonment if they do not.
&gt; 
&gt; “We’re going to minimize the number of ferry departures as much as at all possible,” Martin Henriksen, a spokesman for the Danish People’s Party on immigration, told TV 2. “We’re going to make it as cumbersome and expensive as possible.”
&gt; 
&gt; The deal allocates about $115 million over four years for immigrant facilities on the island, which are scheduled to open in 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; The finance minister, Kristian Jensen, who led the negotiations, said the island was not a prison, but added that anyone placed there would have to sleep there.
&gt; 
&gt; Louise Holck, deputy executive director of The Danish Institute for Human Rights, said her organization would watch the situation “very closely” for possible violations of Denmark’s international obligations.

&gt; 
&gt; His Body Was Behind the Wheel for a Week Before It Was Discovered. This Was His Life.
&gt; The agreement was reached as part of the annual budget negotiations. Each year, the Danish People’s Party demands restrictions on immigrants or refugees in return for its votes on a budget.
&gt; 
&gt; In Denmark, as in much of Europe, the surge in migration from the Middle East and Africa in 2015 and 2016 prompted a populist, nativist backlash.
&gt; 
&gt; The government has vowed to push immigration law to the limits of international conventions on human rights.
&gt; 
&gt; Legal experts said it was too early to tell whether the Lindholm Island project would cross those boundaries, constituting illegal confinement. They said it resembled an Italian government project that was struck down in 1980 by the European Court of Human Rights.
&gt; 
&gt; The Lindholm Island plan furthers the government’s policy of motivating failed asylum seekers to leave the country by making their lives intolerable.
&gt; 
&gt; Asylum seekers with criminal records are not allowed to work in Denmark. Rejected asylum seekers who cannot be deported are given accommodations, where they cannot prepare their own meals, food and an allowance of about $1.20 per day, which is withheld if they fail to cooperate with the authorities.
&gt; 
&gt; A former immigration minister, Birthe Ronn Hornbech, called the island project “a joke” and a blunder comparable to a soccer player scoring a goal for the opposing team.

&gt; “Nothing will become of this proposal,” she wrote in her newspaper column.
&gt; 
&gt; Many foreigners who have been denied asylum cannot be deported to their home countries for fear of abuse or persecution, or simply because those countries refuse to take them back.
&gt; 
&gt; Hundreds lingering in two deportation centers refuse to leave — a challenge for a government that has promised to get rid of those who have no legal right to remain in Denmark.
&gt; 
&gt; Some have held out for more than a decade despite a steady deterioration in living conditions. An independent study by a former prison director now working for the rights group Helsinki Citizens’ Assembly found conditions in one of the deportation centers to be comparable to those in some prisons, or worse.
&gt; 
&gt; Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said last month that the government’s aim in receiving refugees would no longer be to integrate them, but to host them until they can return to their countries of origin.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s not easy to ask families to go home, if they’ve actually settled,” he told a meeting of his party. “But it is the morally right thing. We should not make refugees immigrants.”
&gt; 
&gt; This summer, a ban on face coverings was introduced and quickly nicknamed “the burqa ban” as it followed a debate on the Islamic garment seen by some as “un-Danish.” This month, Parliament is expected to pass legislation requiring immigrants who want to obtain citizenship to shake hands with officials as part of the naturalization ceremony — though some Muslims insist that they cannot shake hands with someone of the opposite sex.

1364,"Storing nuclear waste under ground is alot safer when you know the proccesses of radiation extensively (you can literally calculate how much shielding you will need relative to the scale of the material, radiation is also less deadly the more diffused it is , this is why nuclear bombs detonated not too far from a city arent dangerous to the population even with some fallout, I) (I mentioned not being able to do the equivalent of this of with fracking to be a critical problem with it). Also no, only finland is seriously storing it underground, the USA is not despite several attempts to have permanent storage facilities, Permenant storage for high level nuclear waste (should be noted that a huge amount of nuclear waste is recyclable, but due to nuclear scares the original plants intended to consume said waste never were built and likely wont be as thorium  reactors  are superior and are recieving most of the investment.

Ignorance around high level nuclear waste has led to attempts to build storage facilities being blocked , an infamous story where a town itself enthusiastically wanted to have the storage facility  built there because it would provide essentially permanent jobs (there was gonna be plenty of waste being sent there from all over america) had it blocked by their state senator, ill see if i can find the story as it made my blood boil when I read it, Regardless, nuclear waste is manageable, its easy to transport, move etc, its just no one wants the disposal points in their own areas . The USA has multiple uninhabitable areas  (like yucca mountain, nevada) that can dispose of it, there is literally no reason to anyone ever going to these regions and hiding them inside mountains (excessively difficult to get access to) are usually the most optimal choices.

Or maybe we can realize that the world changes, no one would have looked to Scandinavia as a civilized area of the world two thousand years ago and yet after all this time it's turned out to be probably pretty great in most people's books compared to former big cultural centers like in modern day Iraq.

Kind of hard to say that all nomads is how it would have turned out in Brazil, given that we don't even know the full extent of what the native culture was there prior to European colonization; European disease spread wildly in the delays between initial expeditions, causing apocalyptic-level depopulation across the Americas. However, there's definitely a European explorer by the name of Francisco de Orellana who reported finding vast, densely populated settlements along the Amazon River when he traveled there in the 15th century, sounding rather similar to other praised and famous cities of the Americas other early European explorers visited that were soon emptied out by disease. The tropical environment of Brazil isn't kind to preserving what evidence may have once existed, but some of what does remain is incredible; you may want to look up terra preta, an artificial soil of incredible fertility that regenerates itself.

In any case, the natives who weren't isolated nomads soon came to have a bad time when European colonizers hoping to get rich off the local resources took them in chains and worked many of them to death in inhuman conditions, so not much in the way of counterexamples were left. That problem was 'fixed' by setting up the African slave trade so that Europe could still have an uninterrupted supply of brazilwood, sugar, gold and diamonds streaming in.

1440,"&gt;This is more general. Profit isn't the n°1 motive in everything. Should an hospital first thought be ""how am I going to generate as much money"" ? I don't think it is, therefore, there is no reason to privatise it in the name of profit. Same for other public services.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not more general. Profit isn't the number one motive in healthcare, but profit is the number one motive in lots of thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Oddly enough, that wasn't as much the case when object transport was part of the rail system and not its own private company.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just not true. First of all, it's not a private company at all. SNCF is still 100% owned and operated by the Government of France.  The object (freight) transport division, SNCF Logistics  (formerly known as SNCF Geodis), is also 100% owned by the French State through SNCF. The French State re-nationalized the freight business in 2008 when SNCF bought back Geodis. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And lead to one of the biggest wave of suicides that we ever saw in our  country. But nobody cares because ""prices went down so it was worth it""

&amp;#x200B;

**Nobody cares about it because it's not true**. There were 30 suicides at the company over a 2-year period from 2008-2009. The company had 100,000 workers during this period. That's **15 suicides/100,000 people  per year**. Which is almost the exact same as the French national suicide rate of **12.3/100,000 people per year.** The company had a lot of suicides because it had a lot of workers. The rate of suicides was pretty much the exact same. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is actually an intellectually cowardly argument to make because the people who try to use these suicides to bolster their argument are hiding behind the tragic death of real people  as an excuse to not engage in any actual debate or critical thinking about reform. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yeah, prices went down. Everyone is a little richer because they're paying less money. You know what? If you stole €10 from the pocket of every Frenchman you would have €670 million. You could prevent 670 suicides with that money if you just gave 670 separate depressed farmers €1 million each. Should you do that? French customers have saved a hell of a lot more money than €670 million through reduced prices. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you really think that reduced prices for consumers is bad because it has caused 30 suicides, then I could just as easily say that you are even more evil by not wanting to increase everyone's taxes by €10 to prevent 670 suicides. Privatization didn't kill these people, they killed themselves.

Now he has 5 years of relative free reign and then he needs to be re-elected from scratch, hence be potentially punished even harder. But that does get rid of cohabitation.

I say relative because there is the Senate, and its elections are not synchronized with the President's.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think any tweak of the representative regime can fix it. We can see how citizens have been seeking for an alternative ever since Sarkozy, they picked Hollande as a no-Sarkozy but had their expectations betrayed, then flipped the table in 2017, spreading their votes all over the political spectrum in a sign that they were seeking something *else*. I think it is likely tied to the 2005 referendum and the following European treaties virtually identical to the Constitution that was voted out. The thing with these treaties is that they are largely EPP-made, and turn ordoliberal guidelines defined in Maastricht into hard, enforceable rules. They empower the European Commission so that it can force this right wing economic doctrine of Germanic inspiration onto countries regardless of who is in power. But that doctrine is quite at odds with the French political culture, so whoever is President is going to have a hard time: While most French citizens don't know about the role and power of the EU (though they are starting to become aware), they can see it embodied in their government policies, and it's a hard sell even from a President who decides to embrace it openly like Macron, because it doesn't fit well into the political culture.

&amp;nbsp;

I think that's what led to the loss of confidence we see and the spread of votes all over the place. The referendum was a no, so raising awareness regarding the treaties cannot solve the issue, it will only comfort it and the blame will extend to EU, endangering it further than the EPP governance already did, though maybe providing an opening for a fix at the same time. I see two paths: Tanking through until either people get used to the new European order or until something radical happens, or fixing the treaties, rid them of non-consensual ideology so that people can get policies they relate to.

1536,"&gt; The whole point of reforms would be to stop letting the 1% get away with paying the least taxes, and I'm sure most of the target demographic you talked about (and every target demographic EXCEPT the 1%) would gladly pay a couple % more in taxes if it meant that the rich went from a 0-20% rate now to the flat 40-60 across all income (incl combined cap gains) that they should have been taxed at.

In Belgium? Hell no. For one because our taxes on labor are already insane and even higher than the French ones, so no one wants a tax raise. Of course, everybody wants a tax raise on the wealthiest, but there is a reason our maximum tax bracket of 50% starts at a mere 39 000 EUR a year gross: higher brackets just increase capital flight and leave us with less income than not having those brackets, however unfair it is. The mobility of the wealthy is much higher than that of the commoner and that is obvious in most tax regiments, even those set up by governments including social democrats.

&gt; Our current tax policy is a fucking joke, and it is high time we start jailing white collar crime from rich people to the maximum amount - and perhaps even increase penal guidelines associated with it.

That's fair.

&gt; Our social funds are already heavily underfunded, and we have seen cuts to pensions being applied (I cannot underline how insane this is - it is a retroactive plundering of money the government had guaranteed you when you are too old to provide anymore!)

Oui et non. We had a similar situation in Belgium with social expenditures rising at a rate of 4.5% a year, which of course is a lot higher than economic growth is and cut backs to that social security natural growth (i.e. increase in costs due to aging population and more expensive health care options). Cutting back was the only long term option to keep it in place at all.

Secondly, no, those old folks never put as much into the system as they got out of it: they paid lower taxes generally that were just enough to pay for the cheaper medical care and similar pensions of the smaller generation before them, while medical care now is more expensive and longer in duration and the group of needy is higher than before. They paid enough for a tiny pensions and 1980s quality care, while our taxes rise and our returns would be even lower. This is also the first time in recorded history youth is a poorer generation than the elderly.

&gt; Will you still stand here, cock in fucking hand, enabling the policies that see you get an income bump from 2% but your pension disappearing under the sun and the ultra wealthy taking away near 100% more from their taxed wage.

I move away from a place that is so retarded to set a pension system up as a Ponzi scheme where your returns are determined by future (obligatory) investors. My income has bumped about 25% in terms of tax difference and I have enough to save for my own pensions and needs now, instead of pay through my nose for other people's care while barely affording rent.

&gt; You not knowing how government funding structures work or the fact that these things go heavily underreported to avoid bank runs from panic. 

Damn, I guess I have to throw out my degrees in international politics and business economics then. I could have learned much more hanging around the local Comac kids.

&gt; It is infuriating to see such short-sighted, greedy and selfish views of tax policy. Enjoy your bux.

Thank you :) I finally have hopes of actually owning property myself someday instead of be a wage slave entrapped by wage theft. It's all ideological pandering anyway. Social security as it existed was unsustainable given demographic evolutions and the lack of wealth taxation due to capital flight risks have to be solved on a European or even near-global level instead of just nationally. 

You don't seem to want to be realistic in this: tax your wealthy folks more and theyll live in Brussels, if we do the same they go live in Paris or Lille. But taxing middle-high income folks without wealth like they are the one percent to make up the difference is not the solution: it just causes more skill flight rather than capital flight instead. I haven't studied for 2 masters and post-grad certifications to live in relative poverty because the government takes 55% or so out of every raise.",Belgian in NZ,/r/europe/comments/a2o28c/french_public_opinion_survey_on_the_gilets_jaunes/eb14h7a/,TheApatheist,1543876242

It has no powerful or influential companies on a global scale, little global trade, no concentration of big multinationals and financial institutions, no impact on global markets, no Indonesian companies establishing branches across the world, no noteworthy take-overs by Indonesian companies etc. The Indonesian economy is so unimportant its fluctuations aren't even noticed, let alone resonate across the world like those of China or the US. The Indonesian economy is relatively isolated and largely dependent on the domestic market (which again is large because the country has a very large population). It is pretty much the exact opposite of a world power. It is also a rather weak economy that in the recent past has struggled with debt crises and rampant inflation, and still suffers from a weak currency, decreasing exports, reliance on raw resources as primary export, a lack of foreign investment, low credit ratings, widespread corruption and an ineffective bureaucracy. This is all in the Wikipedia article that you linked. Did you even read it yourself?

That trade goes through Indonesian waters is meaningless. That trade mostly goes from China, Japan or Singapore to the West (or the other way 'round). Indonesia isn't profiting much from that.

The right-wing is liked by right-wing people, but its leaders have gone farther and farther away from the centre, with the idea of ""the right without complex"" leading to a state where the right is divided between its more centre-leaning component and its more far-right-leaning other half.

The left-wing was the Social Party and their allies, until Hollande's deception lead to its death. The party that took over, the France Insoumise, is seen by a lot of left-wing people has been too far left, who'll prefer a centre-left candidate.

We need to keep in mind that Napoleon was illiberal and a militarist. His interest in education wasn't Enlightened and he had little interest in such principles as universal primary education. What he wanted was a pragmatic system to indoctrinate his political and nationalist directives. Domestically, this was to legitimate the centralisation of his authority; foreign education emphasised subordination. In practice, Napoleon wanted to create an academic-military complex, feeding in the sons of the administrative and military elite into studies instrumentalised to the service of his civil administration and military interests.

Of course, though he influenced them, he didn't actually write the Napoleonic Code. While often an improvement, these laws and his example of governance were often regressive or betrayed the liberal ideals of the revolution he usurped. He wasn't interested in universal suffrage or democratic principles, he privileged the wealthy and social elites, faked election results, supported slavery, was awful to the rights of women (eg. 'machines for reproducing children'), extremely censorious, and wasn't even secular. Napoleon wanted to unify the Church with the state; France wouldn't be secular until 1905. He was brutal to his own people and his foreign subjects, enforcing control through political violence and civilian massacres, enforced by a military reassured that any actions it undertakes is justice because of its presumed cultural superiority.

Rather than liberate Europe from feudal nepotism, he made himself a monarch and installed his family members across his conquered vassal states.

The counter-progressive backlash he inspired was also considerable.

This sub's glorification of an illiberal absolutist militarist despot as some progressive liberal hero is insane.",Planetary Union,/r/europe/comments/a2mt0m/on_this_day_in_1805_napoleon_wins_the_most/eb154bj/,ingenvector,1543876729

The economic side of things.
* Energinet, the Danish company investing in the Baltic pipeline, will use Danish citizens aka the users money to invest in something no Danes will draw direct benefit from.
* The overall economic gain for the Danish state as a whole has been hidden behind convoluted calculatings, and even scientist trying to gain insight into how these calculations have been unable to gain a good understanding of the economic gains. This has lead to overall mistrust.
* Danes will according to plans have a decrease in natural gas in the comming years, due to converting to greener alternative, so a lot do not really find this kind of investment encouraging for future plans of 'a greener future' and a plan for decreasing the CO2. Read that this is in direct disagreement with the Paris agreement.
* The people who live next to where the pipeline will be built has to deal with the mess on their land whilst it is under construction, with no visible gain for themselves or any kind of compensation.

So lots of more practical issues about the impact on Danish citizens etc. without actually focusing on the bigger picture.

&gt;However, environmental think tank [E3G](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/experts/e3g-third-generation-enviromentalism) has [found](https://www.e3g.org/docs/Energy_Union_Choices.pdf) that, even in a scenario in which the German power sector were to rapidly switch from coal- to gas-generated electricity, [Nord Stream 2](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_n#nord_stream_2) would be unnecessary. As the report notes, “from a security of supply point of view, there is no need for new import capacity into Germany, like [Nord Stream 2](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_n#nord_stream_2).” Instead, the think tank writes, imports via existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and pipelines would suffice to meet expected future needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover it would be cheaper to improve existing connection via Ukraine. Germany and all involved countries in that project will be Russian hostages. Scenario probably would be that Russians will cut off gas for Ukraine. Then will attack them one more time. Germany and all Western Europe would do nothing. Because your money will be invested in NS2, and Russians will owe you money. In order not to do a harm to your companies involved in this ""friendly"" Germany - Russian project, and because you still need Russian gas, WE will just denounce Russia.

1644,"&gt; So far in 2018 there were almost 16 000 births already (In 2017 the number for the entire year was 20 241), so to me it just seems extremely unlikely that Slovenia would have such a birth rate drop in 2018.

So, let's round up to 16,000 births; that'd favor a smaller decrease.  There are 28 days left in 2018.  If we assume an even birth distribution over the year, that'd be:

16,000/(365-28)x365=17329 for 2018

That'd be a (20241-17329)/20241=14.38% reduction in births from the previous year.

The CIA estimates had it moving from 9.9/1k population birthrate to 9.2/1k population.  That'd be only a (9.9-9.2)/9.9=7.07% reduction.

Unfortunately, that's true. But it also shows how perverse is this whole climate change thing.

Rich countries got rich by destroying their own nature, and by destoying a bit of the poor countrie's nature. And they got away with it because there was still a lot of nature on poor countries.

Now poor countries can't become rich by destroying their own nature because there's no nature left and climate change is real, and they'll be the ones who'll suffer if it gets worse; also, rich countries now care about nature and will economically sabotage poor countries if they destroy the forests (like France vetoing the Trade Agreement that Brazil trully needs). But they also don't receive enough funds from rich countries to become rich without destroying the nature.

There are actually calls for that, a lot of the land in Scotland was muscled illegally away from the owners by aristocrats and then the acquisition was later legalised by parliament. Most of the rightful owners who sued and tried to get their lands back failed in the British court system. The result is that half of the land in Scotland is owned by a very small group of people/families. The illegality, the nature of the crimes and the short comings of parliament are well documented and there is an argument that the property should be returned. I see it similar a similar argument to the looted art or property during WWII.

1784,"You highlight 2 differences: firstly, that he hasn't 'felt that way for a long time' (which is a requirement for changing gender), and secondly that there are specific age-based laws which would be affected, e.g. pensions, driving age, etc.

My rebuttal would be that, firstly, he can 'feel 20 years younger' for longer then. Once he has 'felt younger' for a few more years, then what will the difference be? The simple 'passing of time' is not a very strict legal requirement and doesn't really differentiate this issue from the one of gender in my opinion.

Secondly, there are also, gender-specific laws which are affected by allowing people to change gender, which don't apply to age. Sure, changes in age would affect legal driving ages, etc, but changes in gender affect, among other things:

* Access to sex-segregated public spaces, e.g. swimming pool changing rooms
* Access to sex-segregated sporting competitions, e.g. boxing and cage-fighting (a transgender male-to-female fighter broke their female opponent's eye socket in their debut fight, for example)
* Access to sex-segregated institutions, e.g. prisons (in the UK we have had a serial sex offender change their gender to female and then continue to rape women in their new, women's prison)
* Access to sex-segregated positive discrimination measures, e.g. all-female shortlists (we already have examples of biological males who identify as females applying for female-only political shortlists and for female-only STEM scholarship and mentoring schemes)

In the same way that there are some unique legal issues/challenges created by allowing people to legally change their age, there are some unique legal issues/challenges created by allowing people to change their gender.

So in summary I'm still not sure that deciding to change age is unique compared to deciding to change gender. Maybe just that the age thing would be more costly in the long-run?

| Limiting population growth isn't a legitimate factor here.

Yes. Its really is. This is a long term problem. If we use x amount of energy per head and we increase our population by 25% we probably produce somewhere in the region of 20-25% more greenhouses gases cause per head we actually use about the same amount of energy.

I actually think that it's normal for places to handle growth better than decline.  We've had many rapidly-growing cities, but Detroit, which shrank rapidly, was a clusterfuck.  Declining gracefully means looking ahead and making cuts early, being careful with debt, etc.

If a city grows, you just put in new housing and add services to expand to meet those.  But if it shrinks, you have blocks with maybe one family left on the block, where it's no longer financially-sane to provide water/electricity/close fire and police stations and so forth.  Getting people to leave their home and condemn the area or something is not trivial.

I expect that a disproportionate amount of population decline will be in be in villages and towns, as [urbanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization) is a factor.  Maybe in the extreme case, [ghost towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_town) show up.  Further, even in cities, the EU has room to condense further into large cities, and that might happen:

&gt;Europe already became predominantly urban in the beginning of the 1950s. In the last century 
Europe transformed itself from a largely rural to a predominantly urban continent. Today, 
approximately 359 million people - 72 % of the total EU population - live in cities, towns and suburbs. 
Although the speed of transformation has slowed down, the share of the urban population continues 
to grow. However, Europe is characterised by a more polycentric and less concentrated urban 
structure compared to, for instance, the USA or China. There are 26 cities of more than 1 million 
inhabitants and additional 373 cities of more than 100000 inhabitants in the European Union, 
representing around 165 million people. Only 7% of the EU population live in cities of over 5 million

Add to that the fact that he was glorified by most media during the entire campaign (with the right-wing media Le Figaro going as far as to compare him to Napoleon), he was seen by a lot of people as the only option that wouldn't go towards chaos. Then you need to take into account the fact that this first turn was the worse in terms of representativity (nearly two out of three French citizen voted neither for Macron nor Le Pen) and a second turn where an empty chair would have won against the FN and you get : Macron president.

If you look at the statistics, the main reason Germany's population is somewhat stabilising (neither increasing nor decreasing) is because of the enormous intake of people during the Refugee crisis.

&gt;While the rate climbed only marginally for German women between 2014 and 2015—from 1.42 to 1.43—amongst immigrant women it jumped from 1.86 to 1.95. Almost 900,000 migrants came to Germany last year, the majority from Muslim countries.

This is unsustainable and probably not going to last.

Send them back when they arrive. Pushbacks in the mediterranean, along with setting up camps in MENA where they can try and register for asylum. And of course a foreign policy that rewards democratization and good government practices in the MENA region.

&gt;You should also consider that it's all our fault. The western world has been burning fossil fuels to make their lifes better and yet it's the undeveloped countries with marginal CO2 emissions that will suffer the most.

Apparently not. [The sahel is seeing increased rainfall and plant growth](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-africa-sahel/climate-change-may-turn-africas-arid-sahel-green-researchers-idUSKBN19Q2WK). The main issue is that the political instability is a problem, not the climate change that's coming.

Furthermore, we are actually reducing our CO2 emission, just not quick enough because we apparently don't want to keep nuclear plants open or build new ones, but still. Developing countries have a much worse recent track record.

&gt;If we turn away from those people we are no better than Putin.

At the moment it's a convenient statement to make. Once the flood hits however, it's gonna be a different story.

Europe can only support a certain population because we have rather little natural resources. Afrika is incredibly rich, but doesn't have the institutions required to make the best of it.

No, it doesn't. Because the manufacturing with the most emissions will move out of the country, to one with less regulations, and Europe and North America will begin important their cheap trinkets from there instead. 

So we can just chase emissions around the globe, pumping up and knocking down economies as we do it. Or we could look at reducing demand for products that create high emissions. Instead of telling China to cut emissions, we can throw a carbon tax on any item sold in our countries, reducing demand for those items - or at least encouraging the manufacturers of those products to reduce their environment footprint.",,/r/europe/comments/a2mv8k/co2_emissions_per_capita_by_countries/eb00n3k/,bsbbtnh,1543847076
1917,"&gt; Average car in my country is &gt; 10 years old. Nobody raises an eye seeing mid-90s car. Germany is more rich, but they still regularly run 10+ year old cars. Then we buy 2nd hand from Germany and run them till death :)

OK, this is making more sense to me, because the last time I heard anybody talk about rusting Japanese cars was the 90s.

&gt;I never get the ""maintenance cost on German cars"" sentiment tbh. Maybe you buy only hi-end cars and that's why it seems ridiculous. 

Yes, that's true, we barely have any VW branded German cars here, they are all Audi, Porsche, BMW, Benz, and you can't get them stripped down, certainly not without alloy wheels.

So many of my friends used to have Audi's A4/S4, and they got absolutely murdered of repairs/maintenance.  Now they all drive large American SUVs or pickup trucks, except for one guy who drives a Toureg.  Because of these costs, people here will generally lease a new luxury car every three years, because once these cars go off of warranty, they are a nightmare.  My friend preemptively sold his V8 S4 because after 75k miles, it is guaranteed to need an engine rebuild.

I've generally stuck to Ford vehicles, and I've been pretty happy with them.  I'm considering a Honda for my next car, maybe a used Ridgeline pickup, now that I own a house.  I also only drive a few miles to the train station every day, so fuel efficiency is not a concern.

Generally speaking, if you have an American/Asian car, the costs are minimal.  You just change tires/oil, new brake pads for the most part.  Honda and Toyota are also the most dependable cars on earth, they can go 300,000 miles with nothing more than a timing belt change and new water pump.

1980,"Exaggerating things to this extent doesn’t help your cause either and many climate scientists agree with that. With it often not being them but things like the media, politicians, celebraties and organisations like Greenpeace who have quite a few pseudoscientific views themselves. Such as opposition to genetically modified food which safety has just about as high support as man made climate change. So they can not really claim to be as pro science as they like to pretend. David Attenbourgh himself thinks that overpopulation is a problem, when in reality it is pretty much regarded as a myth by nearly everyone who studies it so he can not boost about the fact he is so pro science either. I certainly accept that man made climate change is real but that doesn’t mean that I am not critical of this kind of thing. 

Life adapted and did reasonably well, the dinosaurs thrived on a world with far more CO2 than today. The current amount, while raising pretty fast is nothing on a geological scale.

4. One cannot inherit a sentence


So, if one was to abolish the monarchy and confiscate their land based on the crimes of their ancestors it would only be just to do so for everybody who has gained their land by similar means (and why not other property as well?). On top of that I am rather certain that if one has bought unwittingly something that was stolen, its legal owner is the one it was stolen from. Will we after this find anyone who has ""true ownership"" of their lands? 


Too much work is not alone a reason to not strive for what is right, which is why I'd like to focus on 
the two last of my ""foundation of law"". I am quite certain that the way ones ancestors acquired their property was either: technically legal or the contemporary justice system has accepted compensation of said ancestors thus giving them right to that property.

There is plenty of context in which this is irrelevant to the topic at hand. What if these images aren't from yesterday at all, but some other random protest in France or elsewhere in the world? 

Personally, I'd settle with someone verifying the time/date of the recording as proof enough. I do not really think this beyond the French (or any EU) police, especially not after such serious riots. They feel personally wronged and are getting revenge, and to be honest, depending on what the guy did prior to getting chased down the street, I think it might be completely fine that they beat the living shit out of him.

This is why anything we read on reddit is just irrelevant blah blah written by selfish fools and believed and accepted by the small minded.

Lets be honest, if the world lived by your standards, we would not be doing any business with the US, or the EU, or the UK, India, China, Canada, In fact no one would be doing business with any of the major countries, except maybe Japan, but of course by your principals they would not want to be doing  business with the US or you or the UK,EU,  Russia, China etc etc... 

Business and politics has nothing to do with your personal feeling and what you are offended about, you should keep those feelings for in your home where they may have relevance, unless you still live with your parents, in which case they have no relevance at all.

Depending on if it is actually an outlier in the construction costs, NPPs might become more viable again. But i doubt that modern plants with all the added safety in equipment and design can reach the same low price as our old NPPs.

I might as well throw in some upsides to nuclear power as well:

1: Obviously nuclear power is free from carbon emissions

2: The fuel is basically unlimited. While we only have limited Uranium ore deposits left, the amount of Uranium in sea water is huge and it replenishes itself. Harvesting this Uranium doubles the cost per kg, but as i said the fuel costs are only a minor cost factor.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Bandera

Of course things got out of hands with him after all, Bandera couldn't  be controlled and been prosecuted by the gestapo after all but he is a legend in nationalist groups. Every single demonstration in Ukraine contains red-black flags that were very common to be used by OUN- UPA. For example most of the concentration camps crew were Ukrainians not Germans.

Victor Youschenko honoured him with medal but it has been canceled after protests from EU, Poland and other nations. Poroschenko blocks polish historical organisations to make exhumations related to the mass murdered poles at the Wolhynia area related to this criminal organisation and there were huge protests when Polish government proclaimed in some act that this Wolhynia attack on innocent civilians by Ukrainian revels was an mass murder. It made Ukraine angry and they asked Poland to leave it.

The thing is there's not much of a history that this nation can be proud of so they choose a hero that is shady and was responsible to murder few hundred thousand people, because after all he fought with Russians hand by hand with Nazis.

I am not all that deeply interested in that to provide you specific names of all Ukrainian politicians that consider Bandera as a hero but there are many.",,/r/europe/comments/a2f0tn/ukraines_poroshenko_urges_german_naval_presence/eaznak7/,SoulPerisher,1543826273

2396,"Well if The east does not see it as a blessing and the west neither anymore we could solve it quickly. 

It wont be a problem for the Netherlands, altough the have to find other people to do those awful jobs in construction and greenhouses that are now done by East European people. But lets be honest they have and will always find people. (I dont think it is fair! But it is that way, people from the east are here because they are cheap.) I find it weird you are not talking about rascism against east Europeans. That happends also an awful lot. I work for a construction company and sometimes have awful brawls/disagreements with foremen how they do not threat east Europeans with the basic respect everyone should get. The times i have put on safetygear and show people from the east what is expected they do because they dont get the English instruction and the foremen wants them to leave the site is numerous, i do not only stand up for brown immigrants but also for those from the east. 

I understand people from east Europe dont seem themselves the same as brown immigrants but in the Netherlands the people whom are rascist dont judge only by color. They see white east Europeans the same as brown ones. (It is somewhat funny in a tragic way that they dont discriminate in that way).

Your sources are just really bad:
Your first source is a badly written opinion by someone from East-Europe with quit a few lies/totally fake statistics from sources that dont excist/mistakes that she wrote down as facts. Fine if they want to write an opinion but presenting that as a good source is not right. 

The second one you should also see in the context, but i think you are not able to do that, you just want to say the Netherlands is bad. You can just have that opinion without giving this type of 'sources'.

The last source is about the reaction of the Dutch to the Turkish minister who came to campaign in the Netherlands last year. As someone who is very left i think the Dutch did nothing wrong, those Dutch people with Turkish roots should be protected against that kind of Erdogan propaganda. If they want to vote that is oké but the Netherlands does not facilitate for Erdogan or his ministers. You may find that rascist but then i just think you must be very dumb. 

Also im not talking about propaganda from the west that Poland does not let immigrants in. I look at statistics. The numbers. Do you know for instance Poland has every year less people in it? Way more people move out then they let in or are born within the borders. In the Netherlands it only increases every year. I look up that source for you. 

Edit: the sources: [source 1](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2112rank.html)  [source 2](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.NETM?year_high_desc=true) 
Having that growth is good for the Netherlands altough it already is a dense country, i even want to state we need it to have enough money for the pensions from all babyboomers. Having a decreasing population the coming years would be a very bad thing. 

Also if we would have a real discussion (instead of me debunking all kinds of weird random claims you make), i would say i do believe in temporary permits for refugees. That also would not be an ideal situation but is the best one i can think of.

2529,"That's not it at all. It started with the oil thing but it quickly became something bigger. The thing is, in France you have just enough money to pay you bills, food and taxes. We are the most taxed country in the world, and it doesn't feel justified at all. My current salary is 1800€, before taxes it is 2420€. So I give more than 600€ every month automatically to the country. That's just what I get taken out on my paycheck. Here's what we have to pay next : 

- The home tax that you pay every year and the amount depends of your location (700€/year in my city)


- Taxes on income every year, roughly one salary


- VAT which is 20% of every purchase you make.


- The TV tax, that everyone with a screen must pay to finance the shitshow that is television channels in France whether you watch any or not, 275€/y. 

The real problem is that more and more people who have jobs and work hard always seem to run out of money weeks before the end of the month, and that all we see in price increases on housing, food, oil, everything but salaries. 


Companies can't  pay their employees more because they get taxed more, in France an employee costs twice his salary to the employer, because half of it goes to this fucking government. 


So you pay taxes, your employer pays taxes, then you take your money, buy stuff and pay taxes for buying stuff. Whatever you do, it always seem like you're giving them the money back.

Germany industrialised later than Britain and France, but much quicker, and by the 1910s, it had grown into the second or third largest (depends on how you count) industrial powerhouse on the globe. 

You don't need a vast colonial enterprise to improve living standards, and you don't need to aspire to run the world to make your populace have a decent livelihood - that's the point. 

&gt; But how many Germans have emigrated to the US since 1883? 

Well, quite some. But a significant number of them emigrated because of political oppression. That's how you got all those fine liberals (remember the ""fourty-niners""?), the union people and the social democrats (after the founding of the Empire) who saw to it that every little village in the Midwest had a printing press, a brewery and a newspaper. ;-)

Wheather will get more extreme. Do you remember the heat wave that hit Europe during the summer? Those events will be far more common along with more frequent and severe floods and storms in Europe. The rest of the world will have it mich worse as Hurricanes and Taifuns will also get stronger and more dangerous along with droughts. As developing countries are threatened most by it there will be a lot of refugees from those countries escaping clinate change induced hunger and destruction.

To focus on Europe:
-we will have to build up expensive infrastricture to deal with heavy floods and storms
-we will have to live through heat waves
-we will have to deal with refugees

And the only thing that we can change about those things is the extent it will hit us. If we do a lot for the enviroment we will have less floods and less refugees. If we do nothing those things will get exponentially worse.

For a long time riots happened in poor neighborhoods, and a lot of people said that it was stupid to burn your neighbor car (that's a sound argument), but yesterday it clearly wasn't the case.

Riots and demos happened in some of the wealthiests districts of Paris (4th, 8th, 16th and close 17th mostly), where you can find expensive restaurants, ambassies, banks and luxury shops. And there are a lot of old buildings in Paris so it's pretty common for rich people to park their second car on the street because underground parking space is severely lacking (basically Paris is really really small so even most 1%ers don't have two cars underground garages).

Lastly if you live in Paris ""intra-muros"" having a car is usually a luxury outside of some very specific jobs (and people who have those jobs don't live in these districts). In 2014, only 36% of Parisian households had one or more cars and 13% used it to go to work (even less need it to work).

I'd be more concerned, if I held this position, with concentrating on wealthy businessmen, bankers, politicians etc. that actually hold tangible power and influence than a purely symbolic institution that is overwhelmingly popular. Furthermore, solving wealth inequality by confiscating the wealth of the rich just seems like a....I don't know kind of extreme solution. Wouldn't a better alternative be to create an environment which would encourage greater education and opportunities for those who are currently struggling?

Furthermore, the video even states that most of the money that goes into the monarchy, such as the jewelry and palaces would still need to paid for anyway without the monarchy as they would have to be protected and restored by the state anyway.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_peoples

After the Iron Age, they no longer exist.

&gt;Moreover, another Western Anatolian city, a Luwian city called Wilusa which is said to be ancient Troy had a king named Alexander(a more archaic version) which demonstrates deep cultural and population exchanges

Alaksandu* His father was an Anatolian. Piyama-Radu. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyama-Radu

He's the guy who fought the Greeks in Iliad. Should I say his name? It's Priam.

In this letter, the Hittite king refers to former hostilities between the Hittites and the Ahhiyawans over Wilusa, which had now been resolved amicably:

&gt;""Now as we have come to an agreement on Wilusa over which we went to war...""

Also Ahhiyawa wasn't in Anatolia.

&gt;but they built on them

they first erased them, then they built their stuff on them.

fun fact is that, Turks have been in Anatolia for 1000 years and in Balkans for 700 years. Yet no native culture was Turkified or eradicated by the Turks.

The method of dealing with them always have been the same: give them enough, stomp on them or lose power to a better demagogue. When you do not have ideology that's what you will have. 

When you have ideology you act always only one way: give what makes sense and stomp on them if they protest. 

I just realized that this is what characterized ""democracy"" from the dawn of time (Greece and Rome) - absence of ideology. Both republics had almost zero religious beliefs (even at that time nobody treated paganism seriously), the only ideological option at that time. 

When you have ideology - Fascism, Communism or Islam - you establish your power against the will of the majority, by force. And this is the only right thing to do. 

Without ideology, there is no humanity, there is a consumerist cattle of iPhone worshippers. 

That's what they do without ideology. Moses left for a trip and his cattle started worshipping a golden calf (even despite the fact that Aaron was there).

There are different ways to try and fix this system : drastically reduce the power of the president, and make things more akin to Germany or Iceland for example, if we have to take republics as example, where the prime minister is more important. And have a proportionnal system. In a proportionnal system, no need for a second turn : your party got 24%? It will have 24% of the seats in parliament, and the other parties will have the 76% remaining, with each the percentage they got. So, in France, based on legislative elections the parliament would look like this : EM : 28%, the other parties would have the 72% other percents, each with the percentage they got at the elections. The president will be chosen among the party that got the most votes, but will have a symbolic power more than anything else.

I'm well aware that other religions have committed acts of violence but all other religions that I know of have abandoned the teachings that lead to it and none are based on it.  The founder of islam was a warlord that committed vast amounts of violence.  In order to renounce violence then you need to renounce him and what he said and that is what islam is based on.  

Other religions may have been twisted at some point to include violence but they were never based on it.  For example in Christianity, God judges you after you have already died of something else.  If you do not believe then it simply does not apply because you are already dead.  For example, the Amish are very strict about many things but they are also very non-violent because when an Amish guy sees me, regardless of what he thinks my fate is for all eternity, I know that he feels zero obligation to push the process along.  

In islam, man judges and punishes while you are still alive and all too often you are treated worse if you do not believe.  

You mention buddhists persecuting muslims in East Asia but you forget to mention the reason why.  Their religion does not call for it.  They do it because for generations there have muslims terrorists murdering innocent people for not being muslim.  The Buddhists do it in spite of their religion not because of it.  If you deny this fine, name a Buddhist religious leader that calls for it.  As we both know there are countless imams that call for violence.

Transport is the EU’s second largest household expenditure item after housing (24.2% of total consumption expenditure). Food and non-alcoholic beverages follow in third place (12.2%).

In the EU in 2017, the share of household expenditure devoted to transport was largest in Slovenia (16.3%) and Lithuania (16.0%) They were followed by Germany (14.7%), Luxembourg (14.4%) and Bulgaria (13.9%).

At the opposite end of the scale, Slovakia (7.9%), Czechia (10.1%), Belgium (11.1%), Romania (11.2%), Estonia and Spain (both 11.6%) spent the lowest share of their household expenditure on transport.

Between 2007 and 2017, the share of transport expenditure in total household expenditure decreased or remained stable in most Member States.

North Korea openly tested nukes for 8 years while Obama was in power and Obama did not impact the situation.  In Iran, Obama passed a deal that shielded the Iranians, funneled vast amount of resources to them and made fixing the problem harder for future presidents.

Trump has stopped nuke testing in North Korea and has them on a path towards giving up nukes and ending a generations long war.

&gt; https://www.ft.com/content/3b841b10-a765-11e8-8ecf-a7ae1beff35b

President Trump singled out for commendation Italy’s new tough line on immigration. As a nationalist and populist, Conte has more in common with Trump than other European leaders.

*“I agree very much with what you are doing with respect to migration, and illegal immigration, and even legal immigration,”* Trump said to Conte. *“He has taken a very firm stance on the border, a stance that few countries have taken. And frankly he is doing the right thing in my opinion.”*

Trump’s warm words for Conte illustrate that the president’s “America First” foreign policy is in practice a policy of building closer ties with governments that share the president’s own politics.

There’s been a lot written on Trump’s hostility to traditional allies, but it increasingly appears that this hostility is specific to allies with centrist or left governments who want to uphold the status quo.

He’s proven much more supportive of allies (and non-allies!) with anti-establishment governments. Trump’s stance on the UK for example is instructive. His treatment of the UK seems to vary significantly based on whether May governs as more *ideologically* right or *ideologically* neutral, particularly on Brexit and immigration.",,/r/europe/comments/a2aaf7/italys_pm_conte_and_us_president_g20/eawghnz/,seamath2,1543724758

3640,"Ok, story time since I see my post is STILL popping. I grew up in a Communist country in the 70s and 80s and through work and friends I was acquainted with many Communist Party members and the political intelligentsia. And you know what? After looking through r/Anarchism and r/IWW , I gotta tell you, you Reddit folks are absolutely not the same people. They were well educated, extremely well-read, clever, sophisticated and ambitious -- ruthless, but still, they were that society's political elite.

You are first world manchildren grasping onto something, anything really, to find identity and meaning. Edgelords. In that communist system, petty thieves, the mentally ill, the political agitators, and the idle were considered ""social parasites"" and got regularly picked up by the local police for a little corrective lesson every now and then. There were no handouts or welfare. And Communists were very serious about law and order. Even if you got the communist system you wanted in your Western countries, you would still be at the bottom of the social hierarchy, the lowest of the low -- because you are not useful to anyone. Even the hardened criminals were higher up because they had courage and also did the authorities' dirty work for them.

But hope springs eternal, everyone can be reedemed. Sort yourselves out. Find meaning in positive things. And clean your damn rooms

EDIT: The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. Thank you for letting me know you're still reading. I just realized that Reddit is a place for lonely depressed people, which is why it attracts so many first-world Communists.

Trump and Kim signed a paper vague enough to literally mean nothing but it was blown up by their respective PR teams and now Trump is too afraid to bring it up again because that would mean admitting that their summit was fruitless.

Trump is doing a terrible job on combating nuclear weapons because in every negotiation the US has for the next several decades, the people on the other side will be wondering if the agreement will just be another JCPOA that gets shredded as soon as another administration takes over. You can’t renege on an agreement immediately after signing it and expect anyone to put their faith in future agreements. The damage Trump has done is long-term damage to American credibility that will take decades to fix.

And again what is he doing on Iran that’s any different than the US approach pre-JCPOA? It’s not like he replaced it with some new paradigm, he just went back to the old paradigm that was rapidly approaching a nuclear-armed Iran. Now we’re back to 2015 but Iran has improved standing in the eyes of other countries and the US has lost a ton of credibility in all future negotiations.

Since then they have stopped setting off nukes and firing missiles and stopped their wild talk.  They have repatiriated remains of US servicemen and torn down all of the massive amounts of anti American propaganda.  Last week they blew up a number of guard posts along the border and are talking about giving up nukes.  Is it possible that they will derail the process, sure but Trump has made more progress towards resolving the problem than all presidents combined since Truman was in office.  

As for people wondering about US commitment.  Trump promised all of the major things he is doing years ago and is actually keeping campaign promises much to my surprise.  Every agreement that he backed out of, he repeatedly offered to renegotiate and was rebuffed and every one that he pulled out of he had every right to pull out of.  Do you know of any agreements that this is not true of?  Any reasonable leader would trust America more not less.

Who said he returned to pre JCPOA?  Trump has been developing a reputation of waving a big stick and being willing to swing it.  Obama was just good at drawing red lines and abandoning them.  That was the pre-JCPOA policy.  Trump has done a better job of backing up Obama's words than Obama ever did.

We have to acknowledge that the successful British colonies are those which did not rely on cash crop plantation economies (e.g. sugar or cotton plantations. Spain and Portugal had the fortune/unfortune of mostly colonizing land that was perfect for that sort of stuff, and their entire culture and economies were built around these slave economies that had little industrial manufacturing. The most successful ex Iberian colonies are Argentina and Uruguay and Chile, who imported and relied on slaves a lot less than countries like Venezuela or Cuba or Brazil. If Spain had colonized a place like Canada, they'd probably turn out fine as well since slavery there was unprofitable and the local colonists would be forced to rely on industry and education to make their money. We can see this divide in the USA, the South which used to rely on cotton farming and slaves is now poorer, less educated, more dangerous, and generally worse off than the north which did not use slavery in any large numbers and who industrialized early on.",England,/r/europe/comments/a248ig/denmark_to_banish_foreign_convicted_criminals_to/eaw9ea3/,JeuyToTheWorld,1543718130

Particularly that whole ""Russian election interference/Trump"" angle. I don't understand why every little piece of the Muller investigation is ""worldnews"" worthy like the US is the epicenter of the civilized world.

Personally, I think these are [organized interests](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dz470/most_reddit_addicted_city_over_100k_visits_total/) who are pushing narratives like that on Reddit. While it might be easy to dismiss as ""conspiracy theory"", the same was said about the NSA's massive reach and domestic spying, until Snowden blew the whistle on that.

And in that context, the whistle was already [blown a while ago](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks). The spokesman there claims ""none of the interventions happen in English"", but that's because he had to say that back then, as the Smith-Mund Act banned them from aiming any efforts like that against US citizens. But in 2013 the Smith-Mund act was reformed to allow them to also to approach US audiences, which pretty much legalized their ""interventions"" also happening in English.

My issue with nationalism mainly being that I see it as just another version of [dīvide et imperā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule), which in our globalized world can be [too easily abused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom). While what you say may be true, that cooperation is still possible, nationalist sentiments will always look to get the ""biggest advantage for themselves"" (like you admitted earlier when you said you want what's best for Britains people) and thus inherently favor unbalanced/overly competitive deals. Sometimes what's best for ""everybody"" means that some, who've been advantaged for the longest time before, need to cut back a bit.

Countries with shrinking populations suffer from weak economic growth, declining worker productivity and lower levels of consumption. It in some respects becomes a death spiral- one that is difficult if not impossible to reverse.

In both Amsterdam and Anvers are very large jewish communities that seem to live next to the large muslim communitie without to many incidents. It is also not possible to 'send them away' they are as much Dutch as i am. 

In case countries can decide for themselves whom are aloud to come in and who are not you will get more rascism.

Tho, it's weird to hear you say that there are ""no real anti-Russian sentiments"" in the UK, when it isn't just Skirpal, but also ""Russia pushing Brexit"". Here on Reddit, I see plenty of (supposedly) UK people who are complaining about how their country does nothing to confront this ""Russian aggression"".  


Which is kinda funny in the context of how one of the UK's biggest export hits is a ""secret agents with the license to kill"", did Bond ever poison any of his victims? I guess that'd be okay, because he only kills ""bad guys"" aka ""enemies of the state"".  


I agree with your notion that Russia, more specifically, Putin profits from this ""anti-Russia"" bias, it is something that allows him to unite his people behind him, supporting his ""victim of the West"" narrative.   


Just like the economic sanctions, soon entering their 5th year. No economy can go through something like that with the expectation of massive growth. In that context, it's actually quite an accomplishment how Russia is keeping it together, even while being involved, quite expensively, not just in eastern Ukraine, but also Syria.  


Where we gonna have to disagree, quite much I fear, is on your last sentence. To me, nationalism like that is simply an outdated concept, regardless who practices it.

Yes.

No, you don't, this is just the beginning and it can get much worse.


Culture has deeply rooted values that go back for millennials, it's not some social construction. We're basically still Romans today, in our way of thinking. Like take a guy from somewhere in Asia and ask him to describe a picture of a boat, he will most likely begin to describe the background and colours and abstract notions. Take some European dude and he will (most likely ofc) begin begin describing the boat and it's functionalities. 

This is just a banal example but it goes to show that core values and the way people think are deeply deeply rooted in their culture. Plus, I think Europeans are simply better looking. :)

4027,"&gt; But if you don't agree with the decisions of your elected government representatives, you go vote for someone else, you raise opinion through debating, you go about protesting peacefully, etc.

You have to realise that voting is basically a illusion based around a myth that actually makes a difference. Almost all of the western world has 2 party politics (France isn't that bad its closer to 4). But if you vote for another it won't make a difference cause your vote gets diluted and if you vote for the other party they are just doing the same thing but are selling it a different way.

Not to mention that nobody has any clue to vote for because at election time politicians will say one thing. Yet when they are elected will often do exactly the opposite once they realise that they cannot actually change anything of any real significance. The first thing that seems to happen on a build up to an election is the truth dies and the media spiels scandal's depending on which party they don't want to get elected!

A really strange example is my country. We actually vote for one of two specific parties to prevent the other party from gaining complete control. Not because the parties we actually vote for actually represent our views and values! Is's because we defiantly don't want the other parties views and values.

So hows that work for democracy?

4056,"Yes, every young man spends 6-13 months raking the national forests. Be it nightless night in June or eternal darkness in December, our young and strong wield their numbered, beloved and hated mk-62 or 95 rakes to keep fires from burning down our country that is 80% forests.

Trading rake stories is a common way of bonding in a new group of Finnish men, after ample amounts of alcohol consumption. Of course the older generations tend to exaggerate how hard their raking service was, how they were hazed by their raking supervisors and had to rake day and night. The younger generations know that it's still the same raking service it's been since the 60's.

The winter is the worst. All the rakers have to sleep in tents and need to keep the fire in the heaters burning by keeping firewatch for usually 1-2 hours each, getting only some hours of sleep. Moreover the higher-ups often want to do mock firealarms several times a night to teach the young rakers to stay vigilant. Also in winter, because of the abundant snow we get, the rakers need to grab their official snow shovels and clean the ground of snow before they can continue raking.

I did my rake summer -12 to summer -13. I was lucky that the autumn was dry, so the leaves were quite easy to rake, but then we had huge snowfall so we had to shovel more snow than usual.

It's a good tradition, keeps the national unity and spirit up. It's good for national security also, because of the fire prevention, especially the badly kept forests on the Russian side of the border pose a huge fire hazard, and Finland would definitely be one of the first countries that would feel the burn if Russia goes up in flames.

However, there has been talks of how it being mandatory possibly infringes on human rights, and since it is only the men it is a bit unequal, since men have to spend at least half a year raking away while the women can go forward with their studies and lives.

 Women can however join the raking as volunteers. They can go raking around for around six weeks, and if they don't want to continue they can stop, or they can go the full 12 months or even go professional. The amount of female volunteers has increased since it was allowed in the 90's, with hundreds of girls joining the national rakers each year now.

Sweden got rid of their mandatory raking service a few years ago and they had huge fires last summer, so now they are probably going to re-implement the service to at least a part of each applicable age group.

We have it good here. I hope no one who does the raking service really ever needs to rake their yards in fear or fire, but as we are a small country (and densely forested) we need to fend the fires ourselves.",,/r/europe/comments/a21yxn/scandinavia_in_a_nutshell/eaviy03/,Suentassu,1543696301

Seeking asylum is not illegal. Having your asylum request processed and denied. Then refusing to leave the country and on top of that committing crimes is very much illegal. In the case of the candidates for this island it involves a lot of criminal activity. 

Denmark have never asked for these lowlifes and have every right to kick them out. 

Let me explain what tålt ophold might mean. It could be war criminals from conflicts around the world that Denmark can not return, simply because Danish law does not allow for extradition of individuals in risk of capital punishment. Are you really saying we should just let such people walk around freely in Denmark without any control of their whereabouts? They are required by law to report to the police station at regular intervals, but the truth is the people on tålt ophold ignores this and they keep popping up in various criminal cases.

The answer to SpaceX is to wake up the Council of Dunces which have allowed it to get to this position, not to neoliberalize fundamental infrastructure while increasing our own fragility to outside forces.

4339,"Nuclear power is the only viable solution. The is no other way around it. I will continue to laugh at any of these ""eco solutions"" unless they include realistic development of nuclear power. Just one container ship consumes over 40 000 gallons of crude oil a day! Compared to that the banning of plastic forks is a joke.

If the funding for it is provided with the same urgency as for the ""alternative"" sources, we could see first results in lets say 10 years. And even in the mean time the ""waste"" from current power plants is nor really a waste but could be reused in future generation reactors. Molten salt reactor research is in (very slow) progress. Thorium can be a part of it (I wish), but it's not the necessary ingredience.

We cannot go into the future expecting we'll get lucky and somebody stumbles on some perpetum mobile or that aliens come and give us some new power source. Nuclear Fusion is 40 years from reality and given the complexity I don't believe it can be made simple and cheap within 100 years.

My whole original point was:

1) ""Ban the straws"" policies are bullshit.
2) They will have no positive impact on the environment (because the problem is elsewhere)
3) Most likely will have negative environmental impact (need to overproduce produce, transport, disposal of short shelf live items)
4) Definitively will have economical impact on regular people.
5) This will gain someone some cheap political points and it hides the real issues.

4364,"&gt;Croatian Ombudswoman Lora Vidović (pictured above) has published a study criticising several state institutions for violating the fundamental values of the country’s constitution and not taking measures against growing levels of hate speech, historical revisionism and explicit usage of Nazi symbols.

&gt;“Throughout Croatia, both the U symbol, used by the Ustaša movement, and swastikas can be clearly seen,” said Vidović in a statement. She expressed her concerns over the widespread use of these symbols on websites and social media, which in most cases, is accompanied by derogatory comments inciting hatred against the Roma, Serbs, Jews and others.


&gt;Vidović stressed that historical revisionism is promoted in the mainstream media, including the public broadcaster and that such views have also gained visibility in the official gazette of Catholic Church as well as nationalist outlets. “In recent years, books and articles have been written and published, public forums held, documentaries filmed and TV shows broadcast denying or diminishing the criminal character of the NDH, the Nazi-allied Croatian state in the second world war,” she added.

&gt;Commenting on the absence of official reactions by the government, led by the conservative Christian Democratic Union, she further concluded that authorities tolerate the issues of hate speech and fascism, which contributes to the intensification of revisionist attitudes.

&gt;Vidović claims that the government’s inaction is not in line with the European Parliament Resolution on the Rise of Neo-Fascist Violence in Europe, which urges EU member states to take immediate measures to condemn and suppress all forms of hate speech and denial of the Holocaust, including the minimisation of Nazi crimes. It should be noted that the same resolution also expressed concerns over the rise of right-wing extremism and neo-fascism in Croatia.

Romania has a fairly broad genetic base to begin with. Layers of german, slavic, greek, turkic, pecheneg, thracian and roman genetics with influxes of refugees from the Hussite Wars and the Russian Old Believers. So you can't really apply the logic of something-ized Romanians, since the population seems to be composed of Romanianized something-else.

But, from the stories we know of, the western Hungarians are part of the central Hungarian population exchange (themselves with heavy slavic undertones) while the east Carpathians/Central Romanian ones, the szekely, seem to have been a tribe or people seperate from the Hungarian central but currently indeterminate origin.

&amp;#x200B;

""The percolating coffee pot was invented by American-born British physicist[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator#cite_note-2) and soldier Count Rumford, otherwise known as Sir [Benjamin Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Thompson) (1753–1814). He invented a percolating coffee pot between 1810 and 1814 following his pioneering work with the Bavarian Army, where he improved the soldiers' diet as well as their clothing. It was his abhorrence of alcohol and his dislike for tea that led him to promote the use of coffee for its stimulating benefits. For his efforts, in 1791, he was named a [Count of the Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire), and granted the formal title of [Reichsgraf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire#Reichsgraf.2C_Gef.C3.BCrsteter_Graf) von Rumford. His pot did not use the rising of boiling water through a tube to form a continuous cycle.

The first modern percolator incorporating these features and capable of being heated on a kitchen stove was invented a few years later, in 1819, by the Parisian tinsmith Joseph-Henry-Marie Laurens[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator#cite_note-3). Its principle was then often copied and modified. There were also attempts to produce closed systems, in other words ""pressure cookers"".

Romania does a lot of things wrong but tolerating minorities isn't one of them. The important thing that matters is that they're allowed to speak Hungarian in their communities and there has never been an effort to make them Romanians as the Hungarians tried beforehand with the Romanians. Also our parliament might be the only one in Europe that gives seats to every minority in the country with the Hungarians getting a higher percentage in elections than the actual percentage of Hungarians in Romania.

The proclamation held place in the [Krsmanović's House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krsmanovi%C4%87_House,_Terazije) in Belgrade, because all representative buildings were damaged greatly by the war, as was the entire city. 

Prior to this, on [November 24th the people of Syrmia-Srem, and on the 25th Bačka, Banat and Baranja](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/a08132/serbia_celebrates_100_years_since_the_people_of/) declared unification with the Kingdom of Serbia.

On November 26th, [Montenegro declared](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/a0ibyk/100_years_ago_today_delegates_of_the_great/) unification with Serbia. 

There was debate in Zagreb whether the [State of Slovenians, Croats and Serbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Slovenes,_Croats_and_Serbs) should unite with Serbia, mostly over the way the future state should be organized (monarchy vs republic, the degree of autonomy of regions etc...), but most agreed some sort of Yugoslavia should be created. The [territorial pretensions of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Slovenes,_Croats_and_Serbs#Conflict_with_Italy), and to a lesser degree of Austria and Hungary, prompted certain politicians, such as [Josip Smodlaka](https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%88%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BF_%D0%A1%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0) from Split, Dalmatia to declare as early as November 14th that Split and Dalmatia will unite with Serbia, even if Zagreb doesn't unite. Finally, a delegation of the State led by [Ante Pavelić Sr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Paveli%C4%87_(1869%E2%80%931938\)) proclaimed unification in Belgrade, on December 1st.

4778,"&gt;Spoiler: almost no one, except a bunch of anarchists somewhere, actually wants ""open borders"" or ""unlimited immigration"".

There are some people who are otherwise pretty cool but completely pants-on-head insane when it comes to migration policy. It's so detached from reality, I can only describe it as some kind of mass hysteria of our times. [Here](https://juliareda.eu/my-vision-for-europe-borderless/)'s a name that's been making the rounds lately in a positive way, and [this](https://diem25.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/European-Spring-Policy-Programme_ENG_Final.pdf) is the manifesto she supports.

&gt;We are calling for the establishment of a European Search and Rescue Operation (ESRO) geared at saving, welcoming, and introducing migrants to Europe. With the ESRO, we call for the immediate suspension of any externalisation of EU borders and migration controls, to comply with its responsibility to allow all people to request protection on European territory. We will increase cooperation with and funding of international organisations working with refugees (UNHCR) and migrants (IOM), while demanding increased accountability and exerting a stronger supervision of the implementation of their principles in their activities. We will support civil society organisations working with migrants and potential migrants in their countries of origin and countries of transit.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We will also fight to include the newcomers into EU politics in their actual places of residence. Despite  
&gt;  
&gt;the fact that millions of EU-migrants, refugees, and newcomers pay their taxes, they do not get to  
&gt;  
&gt;enjoy the full rights of their residence. They are excluded from political decisions that will determine  
&gt;  
&gt;their futures in fundamental ways. We will fight for all newcomers to enjoy full voting rights after a  
&gt;  
&gt;minimum period of residency, including a right to vote in national elections and referenda as well as a  
&gt;  
&gt;right to stand for elections.

But as I said, for many cases, this causes us to be statistically ""better"" than we really are - for example the Nobel Prize thing. Or anything that has to do with very rare cases of something happening per capita, it's just very unreliable data to say the least.



I hadn't really considered that the capital tends to be less religious, but it makes sense. There aren't a lot of very religious people that I've noticed here, with a few exceptions of course. Most of my friends are either atheists, or just simply don't think about it much. It's not something that's really talked about. I've never really spent much time in smaller towns in my adult life, so I have no idea how religious people are in those areas.




But yeah, sorry about the rant, hope it didn't come off as hostile in any way, as it was certainly not intended to be. You just pretty much hit the nail on the head with your joke, in my opinion, and this is a topic I quite enjoy discussing, despite my lack of any real education on the subject.

4857,"Look, USSR number one guy for a long time, Stalin, was ethnic Georgian, he did a lot of carving up of Russian lands and distributing it to minority peoples. His right hand, Beria, was also Georgian.

Stalin's successor, Khrushchev was Ukrainian, he ceded Crimea to Ukraine etc. Brezhnev was moldovian/ukrainian, difficult to say, but certainly not Russian. Next one, Andropov, was Jewish or half-Jewish (his mother's surname was Felkenstein and his father was probably Liberman), and Gorbachev was half-ukrainian (his mother was Ukrainian).

&gt; So we should let the Russian carve up and partition nearby countries because... they were carved up and partitioned by the USSR? That is quite the argument, shall I say.

Exactly, what's wrong with that logic? Communists stole Russian lands and gave them arbitrarily to the newly created states which sometimes didn't even have the majority of respective ethnic groups, like Kazakhstan. And then the West cheerfully accepted that carnage in 1991 and made these unjustified borders accepted by international law, totally agreeing with the worst regime ever existed on Earth, and with violation of Helsinki accords and other international treaties.

&gt; Also, remember that several of this ""totally Russian"" territories (like Crimea) had previous inhabitants that were either displaced or outright genocided and replaced by Russian population. If we are going to go down the ""national/ethnic rights"" path, then Crimea very much belongs to Ukraine (in particular the tartars), and Kaliningrad should be called Köningsberg.
An approach to international law in which divine, ethnic or national rights prevail over treaties and constitutions is not worthy of being called ""international law"", and I refuse to follow it.

Sure, there were always previous inhabitants, even Moscow region had endemic finno-ugric populations, Russians are foreign guests there in a very literal sense. And Crimea had tatars, and before that genuese, greek etc. So what's the point? Should we cede USA back to native americans? Should we make all Russians stateless people because there's not a single square km where someone didn't live before Russians came, and not always peacefully? (Russians were agricultural people and settled lands sparsely populated by prehistoric hunter-gatherers). Certainly we can use some common sense here.

Belovezha treaty of 1991 states that Ukraine and Belarus should have a single military command together with Russia, and everyone conveniently forgot that, as well as a fact that Russians should be able to use their own language in Ukraine and Belarus (which is not the case now). Respect for the international law is a two way road. You chose arbitrary point, e.g. 1994 and stated that treaties and borders which existed in this year are sacred. But what about borders accepted by Helsinki accords? They were violated by 1991-1994 treaties. Every nation will always try to choose a year which most suits it, and in the end real situation is always a compromise.

&gt; I refuse to let Putin do his thing because ""oh, poor Russians who got screwed over by the Communists"" when the major screwers WERE the Russian Communists and the major screwees were the people the Russian are now trying to partition into pieces. Or have we forgotten Holodomor already?

All educated Russian classes fought communists to the end and were mostly imprisoned, killed, starved to death or emigrated. My grandmother's sister was starved to death at the age of two, my grandfather was one of two survivors of his school class, everyone else died from hunger in 1930s-40s. Every educated and/or wealthy Russian was stripped of his/her citizen rights after the 1917 revolution (so called ""lyshentsy""). Holodomor happened in the area predominantly populated by Russian-speaking people (but currently the area is a part of Ukraine), and now Russians are to blame for it! Nice going! It's like a double genocide, first real and then in memory, using orwellian tactics of rewriting history.

&amp;#x200B;

In current times, war will start conventionally. Current doctrines of NATO and Russia is that of measured responses with potential for escalation. Since 1945 there has always been a problem with fitting nuclear weapons onto ""escalation ladder"", anyone using nukes would get nukes in return, and would not use them against enemy unless it's own territory would not be invaded. 

Problem is: Russia has managed to fill in the vast gap in ""escalation ladder"". They have developed variable yield tactical nukes barely more powerful than strongest conventional bombs.  In case of loosing conventional war they would fire tactical nuke against enemy forces. Now what will NATO do? The smallest nuclear bomb NATO possesses is \~50-100 more powerful than one Russia just fired. Will you fire this large nuke? Will you escalate war into full MAD?

If you don't fire any nukes, will you press on conventionally? Russians will continue bombing your forces with mini-nuclear weapons, increasing yield even so slightly. Or you will just stop on Russian border after 1st nuke?

&amp;#x200B;

Afaik, if Russia would attack Poland, Poland could potentially defend itself conventionally and even conduct a counter-attack. But the moment Poland crosses into Russian territory, they will fire tactical nukes. End of war. Poland needs tactical nukes (whole NATO too) to be able to escalate war if needed be.

I'm not 'criticising Europe' for anything, simply pointing out that outside Germany and a few smaller countries like Norway, Switzerland, there are some pretty massive unresolved issues in much of the continent, particularly the East. I excluded Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia from that. 

Moving on, GINI Coefficient for India is not particularly reliable because it's calculated using consumption based data not income due to large number of people working in the informal sector. Consumption based &lt; income based, in general, so the GINI coefficient for India would already be fairly high. Not really big news. 

Furthermore, India has only recently (since the mid 90s) moved away from a Socialist led government with an equally poor population to a right-wing capitalist based one leading to a burgeoning middle class and therefore 'higher inequality'. You see similar trends of increase in income inequality in both the US and UK since the 80s though that's for entirely different reasons. 

That also answers your last point as to why India is behind China. UPA led government did not fully leverage the manufacturing boom as a result of Western outsourcing early on, leading to a 20 year delay behind the Chinese. Now China is smoothly beginning to transition into a more service based model. Moving on, 

The Balkans and Far Eastern Europe (I'm including countries outside the EU too) are most certainly not improving lol. And you also have to take into account the growing underclass of imported labor in the West, which will only get worse as a result of bad fertility rates. 

100 years is too long a time to predict much, I doubt India or even China will face demographic crisis of such proportions anytime soon. Japan will however be an interesting case study as they seem to be reluctant to pursue the same models of the West.

&amp;#x200B;

You're being inconsistent. Are you talking about the individual countries or Europe as a whole? If it's the former it varies from country to country so it's not really accurate, if it's the latter then I would note that most of the Eastern emigrants aren't leaving Europe....so Europe as a whole is not experiencing emigration. Quite the opposite. Also is responding to bad claims really 'getting defensive?' Ok...

This sounds like a bit of an excuse, but whatever. It's undeniable that inequality in India is absurdly high and not going down. I'm just pointing out the inconsistency in mentioning inequalities in Europe while completely ignoring the bigger ones in India.

4900,"&gt; The guy below is talking about robotics and automaton but we're nowhere near close enough to replacing human labor capital.

As that guy allow me to explain: you're making the very common fallacy of taking one snapshot of world in time and extrapolating that for forever like nothing will ever change. 

The thing is things will change and they will change a lot, technology, politics and ideology and even climate will have tremendous impact on the economy for the rest of the 21st century. Your point of automation not mattering only stands if you assume we won't get any significant automation or robotics technology until at least 22nd century, which seems unrealistic. And this change is not to be underestimated, if even some of the possible predictions come true it will be the biggest impact technology has had on human civilization and economy since the Industrial Revolution. 

Furthermore, politics and ideology, national and global can have huge impact on technology, both in explaining why India is seriously lagging behind China or that the biggest obstacle to economic growth during the Cold War was the Iron Curtain, meaning ideology. 

And lastly climate will change and it will change for the worse, even in the best case scenario, we've screwed up the world enough for  that. By 2050 climate change will make the planet that much more inhospitable and cost us billions if not trillions of dollars a year, by 2100 it's likely to be even worse.

Even if it annexes what it calls ""Novorussia"" and puts a border right on the edge of an EU/NATO country? 

More serious intervention has occurred throughout history, let's take for example the Korean War. The South Korean and American army pushed the North Koreans all the way up the Korean peninsula, almost into China itself. The Soviets and Communist Chinese could not accept a border in which a Capitalist (not quite democratic at the time) country was directly adjacent to Communist China.

The reaction was to flood North Korea with the People's Liberation Army and Soviet weapons. We were pushed back to the 38th parallel and the DMZ was formed, creating North Korea as a hermit buffer state between the Communist and Capitalist world.

Do I think things are as serious as the Cold War? No, but that doesn't change the difference between an authoritarian state and a democratic one. Democratic countries rarely annex territory via aggressive wars of conquest. 

Letting a hostile power creep up on your border is a dangerous gambit to play, because you may very well be the next victim. Russia will use its information warfare machine to convince you to [denuclearize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances), [bisect your country into warring separatist factions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_status_referendum,_2014), and [convince you to leave existing security alliances.](https://www.politico.eu/article/how-to-walk-away-from-nato-country-leaving/) One by one, neighbor by neighbor, until we have the USSR instead of the Russian Federation.

I'm not saying liberals are fond of those religious laws, but I really don't see them fighting against them. For example, most of the immigrants are Muslims, Islam has strict rules regarding women, women are groomed since they know how to walk to be wives to some dudes, to get married. Now don't get me wrong, I know there are progressive Muslims, but communities which are far from home tend to stick together, and to preserve their culture they tend to be conservative. So, do those girls have any rights? Was their choice to wear hijabs, burkas or wtf? What's the liberal - feminist reaction to this? We have an American Muslim female athlete wearing hijab, fighting for her rights to wear hijab, and whole liberal America was on her side. Now, I have no problem with her wearing wtf she wants, but in the media it was presented as a feminist move. Feminism and Islam exclude each other.  Problem is that west is embracing primitive traditions, and defending them as a human right. 
I don't like where this comment is going, but let's just say I'm from Balkan, and when you grow up surrounded by lack of law and violence, you tend not to take groups as ANTIFA seriously. 
If that practice is hurting the children, then it's not up to their parents to decide that. Nuns do it when they become nuns, but my opinion on Christianity isn't positive, so we could debate about them also. It was legal, and now there's a reason it's not anymore. We figure it out alone, you know, children rights, not really OK to marry them at 16. And because we want to protect those children, we need laws against that. If you have closed communities, doing that shit, you need to stop them. We shouldn't care about their traditions, they are hurting people, but as far as I can see, that's being tolerated, because it's being done far away from the public eyes.
Sorry, but I don't buy that they are doing anything. Matter of fact, I know the right wing is saying it's worse than it is, but to me it seems that governments ignore these problems, because they don't want to ruin their image of liberal entities. Now, sorry, but I would take drastic measures, if a family can't obey local rules, send them back. Why would we have that kind of behavior in our communities? I know we won't solve the problem, but those communities are closed ones, and they are doing everything to stay that way, which creates problems for local community. And craziest thing of all is that this way of behavior will lead to rise of nationalism, and for fuck sake, as someone from Balkan, believe me, we don't want that shit.",,/r/europe/comments/a1q2uo/female_genital_mutilation_cases_more_than_double/eatxbj3/,mocnizmaj,1543632999

Three months after Germany started invading countries USSR invaded the German allied Finland, as they were fair game for that.  Could be said that aside from the countries Germany was invading USSR was the first to actually try to do something about it, and that the League of Fools was wrong in their labeling it 'illegal'.  Two years later a treaty was signed with Finland and lasted until 1941 when Germany invaded USSR...and lo and behold there's Finnish soldiers among the dead Nazis.  Well shit son...burn the treaty.  lol!  Naturally, once the invasion was held and they could push back Finland was in their sights again.  Close the top of the continent and circle in on the Nazis.

You dont side with those that are sending people to gas chambers by the boxcar.  Its simply not an option.  Granted, Stalin era USSR was harsh, and we see why...every asshole keeps invading them and its the iron fist of rule...and their own bullshit ways they clung too...luckily that most have been left behind.

As far as the UK seller is concerned the delivery is to the UK and thanks to the single market there is no customs to deal with for the shipping company. Now sometimes it happens that a seller in the UK refuses to sell to foreigners despite the delivery address being in the UK which is what will become illegal.

&gt; Angela Merkel wiederum begründete die Sanktionspolitik Deutschlands und der EU  ausführlich. Es gehe, so die Bundeskanzlerin um Grundsätze internationalen Völkerrechts:

&gt; „Wir machen die Sanktionen ja nicht um der Sanktionen willen sondern wir machen diese Sanktionen um einfach deutlich zu machen, dass Länder, auch wenn sie in der territorialen Nähe Russlands liegen, das Recht auf eine eigene Entwicklung haben müssen.“

English

&gt; Angela Merkel in turn justified the sanctions policy of Germany and the EU in detail. It follows, according to the chancellor, principles international international law:

&gt; ""We do not impose sanctions for the sake of imposing sanctions but we impose these sanctions to make it clear that countries, even if they are in the territorial proximity of Russia, have the right to their own development.""

I think this is why people are pissed at Germany. They continue to do nothing in light of serious offences. And it's not surprising, as 7 months ago they were pissed at US sanctions against Russia since they hurt from it (her words). All they are doing is extending the current sanctions they have, which they last did in early Nov.

The victors of the WW2 gave themselves the right to have the final word on pretty much anything via the UNSC. The fact that their opinion carries far more weight than the opinion of somebody weaker is literally the international law.

After the Soviet Union fell, the victors of the Cold War decided that they can effectively dismantle this system as well, as they don't need anybody's approval to do what they want to do and use force against those that oppose them. Now they're shocked that somebody else does the same.

So you can moralize all you want, but there hasn't been a period in history where those that are powerful weren't doing what they pleased to those that aren't.

5231,"&gt;It is not about what you can do to minimize your risk, it is about why  you should be held accountable for something that is not your fault in  any way.

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree. As a matter of public policy, you always want to put the burden of risk on the person who is best able to deal with that risk and prevent the harm. That's what strict liability is all about. If you buy looted art, then you should be held accountable merely because you are the person in the best position to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, when BP had that big oil spill, BP was liable for $20 billion in fines even though it was not BP's fault, but a sub-contractor. The reason for that is because BP was the well operator and the well operator is in the best position to minimize the risk. They could have more closely supervised the subcontractor, or they could have gotten insurance. As long as they knew they had the legal liability at the end of the day, they knew they should have protected themselves. You need accountability somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And what would you say if someone turns up at your doorstep one day and  claims: ""The piece of land you claim to own has been robbed from my  ancestors. Cede it to me immediately.""

&amp;#x200B;

5258,"The United States also helped during the Winter War. The Finnish government was desperately looking for war material and weapons and the US government diverted fighters destined for the USMC to Finland (from Wikipedia):

""In April 1939, the Finnish government contacted the Roosevelt administration, requesting the supply of modern combat aircraft as quickly as possible. On 17 October, the Finnish Embassy in Washington, DC, received a telegram clearing the purchase of fighter aircraft. The only strict requirements laid down by Finnish authorities were that the aircraft be already operational and able to use 87-octane fuel.[26] Part of an F2A-1 shipment – 44 aircraft originally intended for the US Navy – was diverted to Finland,[N 3] by the US State Department, after the USN agreed to instead accept a later shipment of F2A-2 variants.""

The fighters were very modern compared to what the Soviets were using in most of the Winter War and even the Continuation War and were used very effectively agains the Soviets. Even when they were no longer able to go against modern Soviet fighters, they were very useful in ground support and anti-bomber defense up to the end of the war.

5267,"&gt;When should it end? When should an injustice of the past stop to have  consequences in the present? When the victim and his heirs are dead?  When the perpetrators are dead as well?

&amp;#x200B;

It should end when the heir had an opportunity to get the art back, and didn't pursue that opportunity. In the case of the Bloch-Bauer art, they had been trying to get the art back for a long time. It wasn't like they just slept on their rights.

&gt;How long can a claim of that sort be considered rightful, according to you?

This is the way the law works where I live: If somebody steal your property, like your art, then the timer starts the moment that you discover where the property is. For example, if your neighbor steals you painting, then 20 years later you see the painting in their house, you would have 1 year to file suit starting the day you saw the painting in their house and were put on notice. Because it's not your fault you had no idea where the painting was until the day you saw it. You had no idea who to sue during that 20 year period. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the Bloch-Bauer case, the family had no legal option to get the painting back because Austria gave them no legal recourse until the 1990s when Austrian law was changed. (Austria had been deliberately fucking with its law because the Austrian state wanted to keep the art). Then immediately when Austria changed its law in the 1990s, they filed suit.

&amp;#x200B;

It's all about how much time has gone by that you are ""sleeping on your legal rights"". You realize that what Austria did was deliberately prevent these people from enforcing their rights for decades so that eventually they would forget about it? But they didn't forget about it. Austria tried to rig the game in its favor, which is morally wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, even under Austrian law these people were legally entitled to the art once the law was changed in the 1990s.",,/r/europe/comments/a1rwrk/nazilooted_art_why_are_restitutions_still_the/eat7c76/,sandyhands2,1543610135

&gt; but when Švitrigaila, with the support of the Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles,[21] rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia.[29] In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother Žygimantas as grand duke,[


From Wiki on [Union of Horodlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Horod%C5%82o)

&gt;However, culturally, Lithuania and Poland grew closer. Lithuania adopted Polish institutions of castellans and voivodes. Catholic Lithuanian nobles and church officials were granted equal rights with the Polish nobles and clergy. Forty-seven selected Lithuanian nobles were adopted by Polish families and granted Polish coats of arm. Thus the union signified the beginnings of Polonization of Lithuanian culture and the rise of the Lithuanian nobility. It was one of the major steps towards the modernization and Europeanization of Lithuania.[2]

From Wiki on [Ostrow Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostr%C3%B3w_Agreement)

&gt;In 1389, Vytautas started a civil war against Skirgaila, Jogaila's unpopular regent in Lithuania. Skirgaila was appointed after Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo in 1385 and was crowned King of Poland in 1386. The Lithuanians were dissatisfied with the growing Polish influence in Lithuania.[1]

&gt;Jogaila handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace. Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as its Grand Duke (Magnus Dux), while Jogaila adopted the higher title Supreme Prince (Prince Supremus).[12][13] Thus Vytautas recognized that he was Jogaila's vassal whose lands upon his death would pass to the King of Poland.

5341,"&gt;The fact that some forms of wahabi and salafi thought have been able to infiltrate certain neighbourhoods is more of a local problem (Im thinking about the city I was born and raised in, Brussels) than a foreign one as the other commenters seem to imply.

I grew up in the Rhine-Ruhr area in Germany. It‘s a mix of social issues, religious parents and patriarchial values overlapping with “gangster culture“ chauvinism imo, popularized and legitimized by mainstream movies and music. 

This is what counts in the streets. It‘s a strange mix but all build up nicely to form a kind of street armor, where being a muslim is just another feature that adds respect. 

Then the next step, redemption from that “gangsta lifestyle“ might be religiosity and appealing to the elders in ones community, going the straight way..

&gt;Those schools of thought didnt come in with the immigrants that where pushed to the edges of the cities and ended up forming pockets of poverty, they developed from a sort of nationalist sentiment that arose from that marginalization. It became a sort of trendy thing, a subculture as you caled it, a pose. Thats why you get so many kids claiming to be salafis while having no muslim background at all either.

Absolutlely, they have replaced a large part of the bottom class of the countries that took them. 

I think that‘s also the base of the hate of the native lower class youth, the immigrants could act hard without being called out for it, as if the only “accepted way“ to be hard as a youngster was to be part of the “immigrant culture“. 

In order to do that as native (but without acceptance by society) and be backed by people you could count on, you‘d have to join some kind of neonazi group. It‘s basically like ethnic groups in prisons.

&gt;On the other hand if we analyze the same issue but looking at the population who is economically succesfull and lives more spred around the city (Im talking about ""2nd 3rd generation migrants who made it""), you'll see how extremely different their thought on this matter is.

​It very much depends on their parents background. If it‘s a tradional patriarchical family, you can‘t just live how you want, you‘re constantly representing your family and saving face. If your father adores Erdogan, you can‘t hop on Twitter and rant about him without being called out for it by your own community. 

Fortunately, not all immigrants come from patriachical families and can socially afford to find their own best way.

&gt;You coud have got a very similar thing with spanish and portuguese slumtowns in the edge of big cities (allow me to give you some examples) had their countries not entered modernity when being accepted into EU and giving them the option of staying as ""more dign immigrants"" or go back to their rapidly developing countries.

But essentially they all could agree on a similar ideals and way of life, they just were poor. It‘s very different from the situation today, and the combination of things that count for those who don‘t care if they go to prison, or may even regard it as vacation and something they can brag about.",,/r/europe/comments/a1qta3/im_scared_for_the_future_of_my_baby_here_fear_in/easwyff/,bob_lazer,1543602656

Scotland, Wales, the South-West, Northern Ireland, even areas in London all have communities in the gutter. The EU might well be a large contributor to try and get the north and other deprived areas back on their feet - as I mentioned - but for people in these areas nothing is changing. UK government investment in anywhere outside of London and Manchester is minimal of course, nobody is denying that, but when you're receiving EU investment funds and theres still hospital wards closing, housing estates being knocked down and more and more jobs packing up and moving for the cities you have to wonder if its really effective or not. Especially when coupled with the ever increasing costs of living, food, rent, gas and electric, petrol and car maintenance to commute to work because theres no more job opportunities in your town. People wanted a change and for the past twenty years the has been providing more of the same, whether intentional or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Worker protection laws are brilliant, I never criticised them in my post and nor do I intend to. But as those on the continent are so eager to tell us, 'we can't have our cake and eat it'. If you want those worker protection laws you also have to sign up for a whole bunch of neoliberal legislation with the goals of deepening the market. An obvious example of this being privatisation of services, historically opposed by the working class, gets strongly pushed by the EU to the detriment of ordinary people the continent over. Another being the ruling of the EC that ['Services delivered by national health systems are, as a rule, now considered as an economic activity'](http://www.psiru.org/reports/expansion-and-consolidation-major-trends-and-eligibility-european-works-councils.html) means that national health services are suddenly opened up to marketisation and allows the exportation of medical services, potentially depriving locals of medical resources that instead go to well-paying foreign patients – a problematic kind of ‘medical tourism’. There is also an inbuilt inequality around whose choices are increased: patients likely to leave their country for treatment will mainly be those able and accustomed to travel or live abroad, in other words those with higher incomes, this is something that affects every EU member state and not just the UK, especially the poorer states. A final example, albeit a controversial one, is the right to work in other countries. I'm not in any position to speculate as to the true intentions of the legislators who pushed this one through the door but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they simply wanted to pass an innocent piece of legislation that allows people to broaden their work pool. It may well provide people with the ability to go and work wherever they want to within the EU but it also provides company bosses with the ability to pick and choose how much they want to pay employees. Bosses may decide that they want to hire an immigrant who's trying to get on their feet and desperate for work because they won't be picky about wages, unlike the British public who are almost unanimously unhappy with minimum wage. My problem here isn't with the immigrant who has come over here to get a job, in fact I'm glad that people wish to come here to contribute to our economy, my problem is with greedy companies that stoop to this sort of tactic. But regardless of the intent it is a loophole that the legislators don't seem too intent on closing up.

They lapped up that all their problems were the fault of other nations working here and that's because they love to blame others for their own inadequacies and if those others are 'foreigners' then all the better. 

That's not what I'm saying at all and I'm really annoyed that you misrepresented my argument in such a way. Concerns about wage stagnation and deprived services and communities doesn't deserve to be met with finger-wagging accusations of racism, as if the manner in which capitalism pits workers against each other hasn’t long been understood. It’s been astounding to witness so called left-wingers, in meltdown over Brexit, resort to parroting liberal economics. Therefore we hear that factor mobility isn’t about labour arbitrage, that public services aren’t under pressure, that we must prioritise foreign direct investment, provatisation and trade. These things do not match the lived experience of ordinary people in regions of the country devastated by deindustrialisation and disinvestment. The worst thing the British left did was ceding Brexit to the right wing as now any attempt to make a criticique of the EUs forced neoliberal policies gets you lumped in with the racists, the imperialists, the europhobes and all the other ignorants.",,/r/europe/comments/a15x1p/llanelli_a_welsh_town_voted_for_leave_now_one_of/easxfo4/,bundestrojaner,1543602990

5377,"&gt;Ahh Lithuania wasnt dominated by Poland. It was always equal, dual statehood, it never was abolished. 

This is not true. 

From Wiki on [The Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth)

&gt; Although the two component states of the Commonwealth were formally equal, Poland was the dominant partner in the union.[13]

From Wiki on [Union of Krewo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Krewo)

&gt;Jogaila left his brother Skirgaila as his regent in Lithuania. He proved to be unpopular and Lithuanian nobility resented growing Polish influence in the state.


From Wiki on [Jagiello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_Jagie%C5%82%C5%82o)

&gt; but when Švitrigaila, with the support of the Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles,[21] rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia.[29] In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother Žygimantas as grand duke,[


From Wiki on [Union of Horodlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Horod%C5%82o)

&gt;However, culturally, Lithuania and Poland grew closer. Lithuania adopted Polish institutions of castellans and voivodes. Catholic Lithuanian nobles and church officials were granted equal rights with the Polish nobles and clergy. Forty-seven selected Lithuanian nobles were adopted by Polish families and granted Polish coats of arm. Thus the union signified the beginnings of Polonization of Lithuanian culture and the rise of the Lithuanian nobility. It was one of the major steps towards the modernization and Europeanization of Lithuania.[2]

From Wiki on [Ostrow Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostr%C3%B3w_Agreement)

&gt;In 1389, Vytautas started a civil war against Skirgaila, Jogaila's unpopular regent in Lithuania. Skirgaila was appointed after Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo in 1385 and was crowned King of Poland in 1386. The Lithuanians were dissatisfied with the growing Polish influence in Lithuania.[1]

&gt;Jogaila handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace. Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as its Grand Duke (Magnus Dux), while Jogaila adopted the higher title Supreme Prince (Prince Supremus).[12][13] Thus Vytautas recognized that he was Jogaila's vassal whose lands upon his death would pass to the King of Poland.

.

&gt;, just know that lithuania got livonia and russian lands with expansions

So did Poland, and Poland Got Prussia. Poland was still Larger and wealthier and more populated. 

&gt; I could say that Grand duchy of lithuania was dominant, because of Radvilos family that controlled the most land out of all PLC families.

No you cant because its not true, Radvilos was indeed one of the most Richest and powerful nobles in the Commonwealth, but not the only, and you are forgetting that most of the very powerful nobles were in Modern day Belarus from Ruthenian origin and probably never spoke a word of Lithuanian, They were also the first to Polonise.

&gt;Yes Lithuania was going for Scottish model

Scotland was not the dominant partner in the United Kingdom, England was.

If the Axis have to move against the US and Canada then, it will be via a beachhead against a hostile shore with US-Canadian long-term naval dominance, which is not workable.  It is a core element of US global strategy to prevent any major power from building up forces in the Americas to wage anything but a naval war against the US.  Hence the waging of the War of 1812 (the US was concerned that the British Empire might stage through Canada and did not want Canada there), the Monroe Doctrine, the anti-communist activity in Latin America, etc.  The US then seeks naval superiority, so anyone moving against the US is forced to fight a naval war against a stronger opponent.  In a Rainbow Four scenario, the US expected to temporarily lose naval superiority — it would be facing the combined fleets of all other significant naval powers in the world at the time — but expected to be able to outbuild them and reacquire naval dominance before shifting the basic calculus involved could be achieved.

My guess, though I do not know the rationale, is that Western Africa was selected because it could be more or less cut off from Europe other than shipping.  If the Axis lose naval dominance of the Atlantic, they lose the ability to block supply across it and have their own problems supplying forces.  Such a move would not happen until the US  had firm Atlantic control to supply those beachheads.

Pressure across the Atlantic would be used to secure favorable terms, not the New World posessions themselves.  

I agree that a long-term Nazi-Soviet alliance would have been unlikely.  IIRC, even Stalin expected the two to fight, just not as soon as Operation Barbarossa occurred.

**The breadbasket of Europe**

The Ukraine has the most fertile soils in the world, black earth ensures high-yield harvests. But grain exports, which are so important for the country, could be threatened by the political crisis.

The most fertile fields in Europe are in Ukraine. Around 60 million tons of grain are produced there every year - mainly wheat, corn and barley. More than half of this goes abroad. As an exporter of grain, Ukraine ranks third in the world, just behind the United States and the European Union. It is even the world market leader in oilseeds.

The reason lies on the one hand in its sheer size: Ukraine, the second largest country in Europe after Russia and not very densely populated with 45 million inhabitants, offers plenty of space for agriculture. But even more important is the special quality of the Ukrainian arable land.

The fact that soil is not the same as soil is known at the latest when you try your hand as a hobby gardener. The fertile layer of the earth can measure between several centimetres and a few metres deep and forms various complex local ecosystems. Climate, nutrients, water and pollutants play a role.

Chernosems - the most fertile soils of all

The so-called black earth or Chernoseme (after Russian ""chernyj"", black), which is abundantly present in the Ukraine, is one of the continental steppe soils and one of the most fertile of all. They were named after their dark-coloured and up to eighty centimetre thick humus layer. They are ideal substrates, crumbly and loose. Nutrients and water are easy to obtain from the plants, and aeration also helps to achieve high yields.

This fertility is due to the initial rock loess, which is usually the basis of the black earth. The calcareous dust was deposited during the past ice ages and now offers the best living conditions for many animals living in the soil. Earthworms, steppe marmots and field hamsters dig through and mix the ground, from which the black earth then develops. If the steppe soils are not cultivated, they are covered with a lush layer of grasses and herbs that provide the organic material for humus formation.

Ukraine is richer blessed with this than any other country on earth. Thirty percent of the world's black earth can be found here, as part of a contiguous area stretching from Hungary and Romania to Russia, Kazakhstan and parts of Mongolia. In Central Europe, black earths are otherwise rare relics, such as the Thuringian Basin, the Magdeburg and the Hildesheim Börde. It is no coincidence that they belong to the most productive regions in Germany.

The potential is far from exhausted

In Ukraine, black earth covers 56 percent of the country's surface. It is not used for agriculture everywhere, but the Chernosems make up two thirds of the Ukrainian arable land. But their potential is far from exhausted, said Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Nikolai Prisjaschnjuk two years ago. Ukraine wants to produce 80 million tons of grain per year by 2017. In fact, wheat and maize production in Ukraine is on an expansion course. However, it plays only a minor role in supplying the EU, as Germany also exports grain and even competes with Ukraine for the major import countries in North Africa and the Middle East. There, the high population growth and the climate-limited growing conditions lead to strong demand.

Geographically, Ukraine has a clear advantage over Germany. From the ports on the Black Sea, the grain is transported by merchant ships via the Bosporus to the Mediterranean Sea and from there to the major importers. The quality is already different. The Ukraine mainly supplies feed grain, while ""high-quality grain so far comes from other countries, including Germany,"" says Heinz-Wilhelm Strubenhoff. The former project manager of the German-Ukrainian Agricultural Policy Dialogue is currently working as a manager at the International Finance Corporation in Kiev: ""That's why Ukraine hasn't yet made itself felt so strongly as a competitor"".

The agricultural sector in Ukraine offers high growth potential with its land and yield reserves, says Strubenhoff. However, there are still some challenges to be overcome in the future. Production and crop quality can only be increased if some framework conditions change or are adapted. Strubenhoff sees three major risk factors: the weather, weak producer competition and political regulations. Added to this are the poor availability of means of production, the high administrative costs and finally corruption - all of which make the work of farmers in Ukraine very difficult.

Erosion as a threat

But also the black earths themselves become a problem. Since the beginning of the century, the thickness of loess soils has decreased considerably. Erosion is to blame. Excessive stress and improper cultivation cause wind and rain to carry the soil away and it disappears into rivers and oceans.

""This problem is underestimated in Ukraine,"" says Strubenhoff. A study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Bank found that about 500 million tons of Ukrainian soil erode annually. The loss in value is estimated at one third of the total agricultural gross domestic product.

What to do? Strubenhoff proposes ""smart intensification"": Although agricultural land is farmed more intensively, negative consequences are to be curbed by climate protection and erosion control measures. It is obvious that grain exports are elementary for Ukraine. And as long as no war prevents trade, the country remains a breadbasket.

5487,"This is true, but for this poll specifically, I think it doesn't matter that much as it's just % of population in a country. Make sure to note that I am neither an expert by any means, nor have had to use statistics in any way in my entire life. I.e. I have not had to present statistics as proof of something to be reviewed by others. This is intended as speculation, for the sake of entertainment, nothing more.




But it seems to me, if a country with a relatively small population such as Finland (still a much larger population than Iceland, of course) can be compared to Germany or Russia, it shouldn't be a problem to include Iceland. I don't think there's a magic number of people that will suddenly make us statistically relevant in cases such as this. For example, if we were to make the same survey but only in Serbia, we're bound to end up with towns that have a very small population. Those towns would still be included for the sake of completion, even though they might not technically be statistically relevant.




Hell, even just placing an asterisk next to Iceland, and stating at the bottom that ""*numbers may not be accurate due to small sample size"" would be a lot better than not including us. It just feels kinda shitty to never be recognized like this, since we are, after all, an independent European nation.




However, if there is a statistic for ""number of Nobel prizes per capita in Europe"", Iceland should absolutely not be included in that. The fact that one Icelandic person has won a Nobel prize offsets the numbers *massively*. Those kinds of statistics, I agree, our population is a problem and makes the whole thing very inaccurate. But polls like this *should* work, I think. Feel free to correct me, though!




But as for procreating, I am not sure that's going to happen in significant numbers.

(im not going to go into the whole debacle of self-driving cars right now) - in essence, either the tech needs improving or if launched as is right now, major companies like comcast, verizon, at&amp;t would have to share and behave, unless you want 5-6 senders on a corner - OR you build a nation-wide fttx-net where perhaps the State owns the line, company a,b or c can rent space and thusly not need their own sending-equipment. its a whole load of bollocks that never gets mentioned as far as i can tell. everyone thinks it´s the bees knees but never seem to think about the backbone.

Generally people on the fringes tend to find more confidence in declaring their opinions on the internet, often leading to weird situations in which fringe groups can come to be a dominant view on the internet. Generally speaking, the more anonymous the messaging system, the more likely people are to express unpopular views. YouTube comments are a great example. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example today I watched a YT video about the effectiveness of German Army camouflage patterns in WW2 because it was recommended to me by YT and I have no self control.

5742,"&gt;Russia makes money selling gas to Western Europe. In order to do that, they need to run it through Eastern Europe

Not anymore as there is Nord Stream. They can sell gas to a country that pays money for the said gas, filtering out all the shit that comes with tranafering it through a gas stealing country.

&gt;Eastern Europe has some power in all this, because they can stop gas being transferred to Western Europe. This keeps Russia from messing with them too much, because it can cost them money and the lack of gas going to Western Europe will make countries there upset. So Russia can't just go: ""you get no gas for a month"" or ""gas is now double the price"" to influence Eastern European countries.

It costs Germany and all other clients who paid for the gas that was stolen later by a middlw country.

&gt;Germany and other Western European countries should then support Eastern Europe against this, by not accepting this new pipeline

5789,"Storytime people: My great-grandmother who died in 2013 at the age of 99 was born during the last years of the Russian Empire. She lived in Karelia where they ran a bakery with her husband prior to the war. Her husband died during the war (though not in combat, he was in the army but suffered a stroke). She and her friends. like many others, had to move out after the war (because her home region was on the Soviet side of the post-war border) and they re-settled in Helsinki, where she went to work for a bakery and raised her 2 kids alone as a single mother, never re-marrying as a devout christian (although interestingly enough she did convert from the Eastern Orthodox variety to the more common Lutheran faith, probably to fit in better). Both of her kids died when she was still alive, though both lived to a relatively old age of around 60s, but at that point she altready had grandkids, grandkids' kids, and even a few of those had their own first childten. This may explain why, despite losing her husband and her own kids, she never once seemed bitter or angry, having 4 generations of kids to visit her.

Towards the end of her life she was almost entirely deaf and had very poor vision, but she still lived in her small apartment that she had lived in since the 60s, and still actually baked which to me was amazing. A woman of small stature (\~155 cm) but nevertheless commanding presence, like small spruce that will not yield under massive snowfall, she always had a glimmer in her eye. This small and hardy baker from Karelia lived through the rise and fall of the soviet Union, our own civil war, the 2nd world war, saw her place of birth lost to another nation, the beginning and the end of the cold war, the birth of the European Union, a massive jump in technology, and yet never looked back at history or the future with horror but with hope.

I have massive respect for those who made the greatest sacrifice in the war to keep us independent. But what we need to remember is that that is only the halfpoint of the story. The men and women who survived, and, despite the trauma and the massive loss, didn't give up but kept going, rebuilt large parts of the country and the economy, paid the war reparations to the Soviet Union and laid the foundations of the modern welfare state (which we're all beneficiaries of) are just as big heroes as all those who gave their blood to defend this beloved northern corner of ours. So I ask you my fellow countrymen: since independence day is just around the corner, and since the celebration of independence day tends to be heavily concentrated from the media side on the remembering of veterans and the war, do not forget men and women like Outi, without whom most of us writing here today, sipping our lattes and surfing on our phones while worrying about relatively everyday things, would be massively more fucked.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/a1qh8f/today_79_years_ago_the_soviet_union_invaded/eas2o00/,ZenOfPerkele,1543573964

&gt;But again, this map shows why the EU is doomed to fail. Besides some exceptions, one can clearly see the divide between East and West.

So because a part of Europe does not agree with your attitude towards migration, the entire economic pact is supposed to fail? EU binds European countries together in many ways, it does not make EE your vassal, as you specifically (yep I already remember your username because of the frequency of posts like this you make) , judging by your attitude, seem to think.

- during prohibition about 0.5% of people use it

- in comparison to the average joe, regular heroin consumers need 348% more money out of the health funds (higher risk of organ failure, higher risk of accidents, higher risk of everything really)

- in comparison to the average joe, regular heroin consumers pay 850% less in taxes; also the regular heroin consumer receives social welfare 75% of the time

- predictions say legalization would bump regular users to about 1.5% of population

- With the proposed tax model, this will earn us 2 million € in taxes  per year, 3 million € in law enforcement, but cost us 8 million € of the health fund and reduce tax income by 1 million €; also expect international backlash which is hard to measure in € but would maybe weaken possible business deals with other nations

- all in all, we are 4 million € in the red with this proposal, legalization is denied.

5969,"&gt; How that's relevant to what I said? Russia have more than 200k forces in Kaliningrad NOW. Even if west would get information that's something happening it would take them longer to prepare forces.

That military area that is under constant NATO watch, and constantly countered by NATO?

There are bombs that could eliminate all 200k of those men in such a tiny area. And there are almost no civilians in that militarized area.

&gt;Bulkshit baseless assumption. Go ahead and prove it.

Prove that western bombs, planes, tanks, and general military capability is leagues ahead of Russia's? Mate ... just do a quick Google search.

&gt;And you are trying to tell me that Russia don't have them despote spending more than UK on army?

Yeah, they do. And yeah, they spend more: Around 10% more than France.

France &amp; UK spend almost 2x that of Russia. Add in Germany &amp; Italy and it's almost 3x. Add the entire EU and it's over 4x that of Russia ... now please keep on telling me that Russia is somehow superior.

&gt;Again, so you think that Russia don't have them or what?

Yeah, so why on earth would Russia invade an alliance that has nuclear bombs? What on earth would they possibly gain from such an act?

&gt;No. That's just presenting realistic scenario where it takes time to transport forces. Something you don't take into account at all as it suits you.

The realistic scenario is this:

Russia invades Poland, NATO lights immediately go off and Kaliningrad is instantly bombed to oblivion.

Russia responds by sending bombs, this then escalates very quickly into atomic warheads flying from Europe to Russia. At the same time the US launches nuclear warheads towards Russia, Russia responds by launching back.

The entire planet is now a few minutes from being a really tragic atom hellscape. Even the nations that didn't participate will completely collapse: the radiation will engulf the world, food supplies will collapse, civilizations will go crazy.

Humans will most likely go extinct, and if not then only very few will survive. They will live short lives as atmospheric radiation will be extreme and will cause almost all food &amp; water to be radiated.

That's what would happen.

There is no scenario in which Russia invades the EU and things end well.

5980,"&gt;Thinking women are unqualified to lead a country because ""they have periods and think irrationally"" et cetera certainly sets you apart from considering them normally functioning members of society

The people who legitimately think this way are few and far between. Most of them are also not long for this Earth and bring their views from a bygone era. In any case, I see no reason to think they're any more numerous in the US than elsewhere - in fact, I'd wager that the US probably has proportionally fewer than *most* countries in the world. 

&gt;A community being unrealistically excited about women as leaders is at odds with this tenet as it implies they are fundamentally different in terms of leadership skills or methods

Not necessarily. There's certainly an argument that this is just expanding the pool of potential good statesmen and women. Even if the distribution of skills and methods is basically equal between the sexes, a society showing more openness to women in positions of power has up to twice the number of potentially skilled politicians. Now you're certainly right that people on the far-left who think all of the country's problems have been caused solely by men and that a government full of women will fix them are deluded and are probably gonna be disappointed when we *do* elect a female president. But I don't think that number is as numerous as you *seem to be* implying. It just happens that they're many of the loudest voices.
