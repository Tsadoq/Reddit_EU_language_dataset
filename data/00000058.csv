6,"Few people deny that he's likely a nice guy. That's one if the many reasons he's better than Trump. But better than  Trump is a very, very, very low bar.

Biden is an establishment democrat. Establishment democrats are mostly concerned with fundraising, just like their establishment Republicans counterparts (it's just that within the republican party establishment politicians are now increasingly being replaced with outright fascists).

His policies are unlikely to disrupt anything the big corp donors don't want disrupted. That's what they pay both parties for after all.

Problem is that some disruptions are desperately needed.

The private prison industry has to cease to exist at all. Fossile Energy has to be replaced ASAP. Healthcare companies have to be kept in check.

Biden will most likely do better than Trump on all of these, but not that much.
I don't see him hating on windmills and say silly things like windmills cause cancer. He probably won't claim stupid things like coal is clean. He'll rejoin the Paris Climate Accord - which is something. Bit not nearly enough. 

He's probably not going to continue the active destruction of the postal service. But he's not likely to fix the damage done before. And if he tries, a republican senate is not going to let him actually do it.

And to be fair, a Biden administration will be severaly hindered by an outright hostile do-nothinng-except-tax-cuts senate. Just like Obama was before.

But few people expect Biden to be a historically great president. We'll settle for not-horrible for now, as that will already be a massive improvement.

But at some point the US will need a president (and constructive congress) to actually constructively move the country ahead.

Education needs to be funded, police reformed, energy modernized, the whole infrastructure needs repair and upgrades.

Once upon a time the USA was a modernizing nation. Something other nations looked at and saw things to copy from. Now too many are obsessed with a fairy tale past that never existed instead of moving forward.",,/r/europe/comments/jpvdv0/joe_biden_is_elected_president_of_the_united/gblchay/,Oerthling,1604830927

The first few years, the topsoil was definitely very salt, so only a very limited number of plants would grow on it. Over the years, rainfall has slowly dissolved the salt in the top layer and drained it to the sea, so very little of it remains.

However, there is definitely still a lot of salt in the lower layers. You have to be careful not to drain rainwater too quickly, or water from lower layers will carry the salt upwards. The same if you were to drain too much from a well.

Over 2000 people in Palm Beach County accidentally voted for the wrong candidate due to a confusing ballot. (Not incredibly confusing, but apparently just confusing enough.)

Statistics showed Buchanan dramatically overperforming there and Gore underperforming by the same margin. (Buchanan got four times as many votes as expected, and a large portion of them voted Democratic in other elections on the ballot while everywhere else in Florida his voters leaned strongly for the Republican down-ballot candidates.)

Since the networks originally called the state for Gore based on the expected statistical outcome, they retracted it after results came in.

180,"As I said in another reply. 

""Defund the police"" pretty much means moving to a model like most European countries (and some parts of the US) use. Don't have a single institution - the police - be responsible for dealing with all types of issues from crime over domestic disputes to mental health issues. Instead only place armed officers in situations where they are able to deal with the issue, while others will be taken care by new institutions like social workers, mental health specialists and such. 

How many shootings are there, because the police is not trained to deal with people with mental issues, yet is used to quickly resorting to violence? Or similar situations. Not only is it a burden on the community, but also on the police, who get send into situations that they are not well equipped to handle, but they have to deal with the guilt and issues that might stem from it.

""Slavery reparations"" is more controversial, but radical? You do still have the aftereffects of slavery/Jim Crow. In the past I thought that's stupid, but if you look how something as simple as the ability to swim, you'll see that it will take multiple generations for it to reach the level as in white communities. Similarly often the value that's placed on education etc - familial upbringing and the habits learned only change slowly, often not over a single generation (at least population wise). So putting some additional funding in schools in predominantly black areas, special after school programs, providing healthy food in the canteen, and so on - yea urm, while I can understand such ideas would be controversial (as many poor people, including many white poor in the central area are also suffering), that would be another issue - with any proposal in that direction being instantly called the S word! ;[",Hesse (Germany),/r/europe/comments/jpwi2n/looks_like_most_of_europe_will_be_happy_about/gbkzc76/,MilkaC0w,1604824650

251,"When it comes to politics, most Europeans believe the difference between the United States and Europe is similar to the difference between European and American football. Like American football, American democracy is an insider's game. Its electoral system, in which the candidate who loses the popular vote can easily win the White House, probably makes a lot of sense to Americans but not to anyone else. But regardless of the differences, some of the lessons of the American elections are very relevant for Europe.

In his 1972 play Jumpers, the British playwright Tom Stoppard waggishly suggested: ""It's not the voting that's democracy, it's the counting."" This year's US election has proved him right.

Democracy is in its essence a system where the loser, by accepting defeat, legitimizes an election's outcome.

&gt;AfaIk every vote is counted by hand in Finland, why would you even want an automated system for that...

Well, the answer to that is actually quite long. But a wildly oversimplified answer is that there's a big difference between counting the 3 million votes Finland had in 2019 and the 150 million votes that America just had in it's election. Even *with* a 50 fold increase in manpower, running an operation at the scale is just a lot more complex. And it's not likely you'll be able to get 50 times as many election workers.

But, to be totally honest, the real reason the count was slow is partisanship. 

A lot of the laws that exist in states like PA were deliberately put in place with the _intent_ of slowing the count. The reason for this is that if your party can take a lead on election day, then convince a court somewhere that they should order the states to stop counting ballots, you can claim victory.

It has been decades since elections in America have been about convincing people you're the best candidate. Both sides have a large collection of entrenched supporters and very, very few people are truly centrists who swing back and forth. Elections in America are about mobilizing your side to go out and vote, and discouraging or disenfranchising the other side so that they don't or can't.

The Iraq war ended 2011

[On 15 December, an American military ceremony was held in Baghdad putting a formal end to the U.S. mission in Iraq.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War)

&gt;President Obama announced at a White House press conference that all remaining U.S. troops and trainers would leave Iraq by the end of the year as previously scheduled, bringing the U.S. mission in Iraq to an end.

Imagine inheriting a war and people saying it was your fault. You people are out of your mind.

However since like I said it was too early, because the security issue in the country was out of hand they came [back in 2014](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Iraq_(2014%E2%80%93present\)). Which wasn't enough.

People like you can't see longer than what's infront of you. Leaving a country bombed to death is not how you end a war. It was ridiculous for the US to leave in 2011.

693,"Great to hear from our New Zealand friends!

First I want to thank your entire country for giving me one of the best experiences in my live, while hosting me for almost an entire year!

Since there already were answers from other germans, I'm gonna try keeping it short:

1. My absolute favorite German series is ""Generation War"". It (critically and not at all in a nationalist manner) depicts the second World War from the perspective of five young Germans (one of which is jewish). Sadly I heard from some friends that the English voiceover is quite poor, so I'd suggest watching in German with English subtitles.

For a movie I recommend ""Das Boot"" (but I guess it is already quite well known?).

2. For me the first image coming to mind is the stunning beauty of the winery I used to work at in Coromandel. It felt like a second home to me, and the dude who managed it was the most chill guy I ever met. Just in case you're ever around: ""Purangi Winery"", ask for a wine tasting with Danny! It's definetly worth it.

3. Not historical but anyway: In Bavaria beer is considered food (""Grundnahrungsmittel""), and is commonly referred to as liquid bread (""flüssiges Brot"").

3b. I would reccomend you taking a look at Hegel. Don't know if you're into philosophy, but he was a great (for his time very progressive) thinker, who still influences great thinkers of today (as for example Slavoj Žižek).

Well I didn't really keep it short, sorry about that. Still I wanna ask you a question as well:

Thing is: there's still a good bunch of Burschenschaften that's extremely right and sadly extremely loud in the press and the cities they live in.
I've been a member of a fencing, non political and very welcoming frat (don't give a fuck where your from and what's you sexual orientation is, but no extreme political views) and we are under threat of expulsion forbidden to even talk with member of a certain hardcore right frat in the city where our house is.

We won't be able to change anything during this crisis. We are just battling our way through it, we were just not prepared for it.

That's a strong claim, given that Demirtas got the majority vote in the majority of the Sunni Kurdish-majority regions. and Erdogan got the majority vote in the majority of the Sunni Turkish-majority regions.

In the most Kurdish provinces, Erdogan got less than 20% and, moreover, it was only in the most Kurdish provinces that he got less than 20%.

976,"Not always. And in the context of globalization, politics, rather, represent themselves and their voters who are not necessarily 100% of the entire population of the country. Especially when it comes to a kleptocratic government like in Russia and, in fact, even among their voters, people often don't agree with their politicians in everything and vote for them only because there was no candidate that would better reflect their position. In addition, politicians often fool their voters and completely fail to fulfill their promises after being elected. These are the realities of modern politics and, unfortunately, they do not seem to be a lot different in almost any country of this world.

I have several friends from Ukraine who voted for Zelensky last year, but now, just a year later, they despise him because he did not fulfill anything that he promised and their life became even worse. Likewise, Putin's approval rating in 2018 was around 70%, but now this figure has dropped to about 30%. Ie people are disappointed in their politicians, this is a very common situation. Pay attention to the current US presidential elections. Regardless of who wins, the country is monstrously split and it's cannot be said what the new US president reflects the views of all Americans. Russia and its politicians are not the same things. Politics is changeable, and the country has been there before and will continue to exist even after their leaving.  


Therefore, I urge you to be friends with all people and not let politics divide us. We are all people of earth - we are all the same.

The fact that Trump got 47% of the vote is a bit misleading... he is incredibly disliked and viewed as an embarrassment to the other half of country for what I imagine  are the same reasons Europeans look down upon him. 

Overall this is a victory for the republicans.  They will control the senate and will block any major policy changes. They very likely will pick up more seats in 2022 and possibly take over the house (Midterms tend to shift the opposite direction of the president).

The cost of living varies from country to country. If there was a universal minimum wage in the EU it would be too little for a person to survive in expensive countries, and too much in relation to normal jobs in cheaper countries. 

For example Ireland is an expensive country- that's why it has a high minimum wage to match. Romania is a cheaper country where someone working a qualified job, (like a teacher) has the equivalent of minimum wage in Ireland.  

If say 1,000 Euro was the EU standard minimum wage: someone in Ireland would barely have enough to buy food and shelter, and someone working at a fast food chain in Romania would make more than a teacher.

The sector employs about 130,000 people, and produces about 800,000–900,000 light vehicles a year.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Poland#cite_note-paiz-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Poland#cite_note-10) Production of larger [commercial vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_vehicle) was at about 70,000–90,000 in that period.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Poland#cite_note-paiz-9) Most of the sector's output is geared for exports, primarily to the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Poland#cite_note-paiz-9) In 2009 the value of exports from this sector was €15.7 billion, i.e. 16% of all Polish exports.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Poland#cite_note-paiz-9) Since 2010, the number of cars made in Poland has been decreasing from 869,376 to 583,258 in 2013.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Poland#cite_note-11) As of that year Poland was the 23rd [largest automaker in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production).

Major western companies with significant presence in the Polish automotive sector include [Fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat), [Opel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel), [Toyota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota), [Volkswagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen), [MAN Nutzfahrzeuge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAN_Nutzfahrzeuge), [Volvo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo) and [Scania AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scania_AB).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Poland#cite_note-paiz-9) Out of those, historically Fiat had a very strong presence in Poland for almost a century: the Polski Fiat assembly plan was established in the 1920s, and while interrupted by World War II, production of Fiat-licensed vehicles resumed in socialist Poland in 1967.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Poland#cite_note-OECD2005-12)

In the short term, the US has a president who cares about the countries image, but in the long term, it’s problems are still going to be there until many of them get reformed. Trumpism is still going to exist and be there in the Republican Party since the US is a two party country with no proportional representation and therefore no way to sanitary cord the far-right like in many European countries.

1180,"The problem is the way America runs its elections. Over here in The Netherlands, everyone simply automatically gets a letter with their registration on their address. You go to the polls, show that and your ID and vote. At the end of the day the ballots go to a central place in the region and get counted. Done. I imagine it's somewhat similar in Germany.

What the US does right now is throw together all kinds of different types of voting. Americans have to register themselves to vote first for some reason. Then they can vote by mail or in person. And then they have to check the signatures on mail votes against the one you placed when registering to vote. And they have to check nobody tried to mail a vote, but then decided to show up instead to vote in person. And in some places they extended the deadline for votes to arrive by mail, so they have to wait on that. Some states allowed mail in votes to be counted before election already. Others did not.

Basically: their voting system is a mess. Normally this is not so much a problem, since you can kind of see the margins and call a state for a candidate. For example, no way California has counted everything, but you already know who won there anyway. The margins in some states are so small, they need to go through them all before calling a winner.",,/r/europe/comments/jpm0jb/europe_reacts_to_biden_win_european_climate/gbg4v29/,cissoniuss,1604752610

1266,"No, in fact I am pretty pessimistic about the long run and am expecting little.    

The senate is perpetually biased towards Republicans given how senators are allocated (2 per state, no matter the population), Democrats essentially need I think a D+7 environment to break even typically.  Gridlock punctuated by Republican control almost feels like an institution at this point because of this.  I don't think Republican nominees for the Supreme Court are quite as explicitly partisan as Democrats make them out to be, but if reform is your goal, rightly or wrongly, they can definitely be another impediment in how they interpret the constitutionality of laws.  

Really, Republicans didn't do too bad this election sans the presidential.  Trump underperformed compared to his party in general I think which is a little bit encouraging.  However I have always been convinced that Trump is more of a symptom than a cause, and there's a disease in the Republican party and in America in general right now that has been growing in intensity for years.  Republicans are getting more and more deranged, Democrats (always something of a coalition) are getting more and more divided and angry and impatient in a way that I think is hurting their cohesion and success, and misinformation, disinformation, outrage, etc is absolutely everywhere all the time and uncontrollable.  

I honestly find myself more concerned about this country completely going of the rails these days than the prospect of being unable to enact an agenda.  I can't understate how cathartic it is for me to see Trump go, but I would not be shocked by Republicans nominating and winning with another total meme candidate like Tucker Carlson in 2024.

Your particular European country may not have people who live in the mountains and want fuck all to do with society at large, but we do. Your country may not have swamp people, desert people, or small groups of people who live hundreds of miles from anything, but we do.  

One interesting things that's caused some parts of a state to thrive while others die is our highway system.  We completely re-built our interstate highway system starting in the 50's through today really.  Previously, the interstate system we pretty ad-hock and mostly followed rail systems which needed to build stations every so often to refuel and get water.  Hundreds probably thousands of towns were developed along these old train interstate routes at these stations.  Then, trains didn't need to stop as much and we moved the highways. Those towns are just fucked.  There's really nothing we can do about it now, it's just not reasonable to try to save every dying town.  A large number of people leave for better opportunity, but many don't want to or can't.

This all happens in Europe too, but your country may not see the whole thing.  If we really want to call the EU a common market, the US has far less inequality than Europe.

Let's see... According to the [latest report of the inequality-adjusted HDI, i.e. HDI of the average person, not including the super-rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI#2018_inequality-adjusted_HDI_\(IHDI\)_\(2019_report\)), the United States rank 28th in the world, behind Poland (27th), Slovakia (26th), Estonia (20th), Czechia (13th), and Slovenia (12th). The US is actually further from Slovenia than Slovenia is from the first place.

In fact, Belgium, the UK, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, France, Israel, South Korea, Italy, and Spain also rank worse than Slovenia and Czechia.

It's not about being developed. It's about being richer as a country. The fact that some of the richest countries on the planet, including the single richest country in the history of humanity, have a lower average person HDI than a bunch of countries that were stuck in communism - most of them literal colonies of the USSR - for 50 years and were comparatively dirt-poor just 20-30 years ago is beyond laughable.

Also, there's the little detail that the [median wealth of an adult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult#By_country) in the US is 66k USD while in e.g. Slovenia it is 50.5k USD. 

That's the world's single richest country in all of history with

- 244 years of history,
- 328 million people, 
- 9.834 million km² and all the natural resources that go with that, and 
- the preeminent superpower of the last 60 years which didn't get completely messed even once since the industrial revolution began

beating a country that 

- has existed for 30 years, 
- spent the previous 50 under communism ruled by another country,
- has 2 million people spread out over
- 20,000 km², 58.1% of which are forests, and
- which almost started from scratch in 1945 after WW2

by a measly 15.5k USD in median wealth per adult. And let's not even start with access to healthcare, workers' rights etc. for the median person.

So do me a favor and don't give me the less developed nonsense, *especially* not when comparing to the US. The US is a paradise if you're in the top couple of deciles. As soon as you drop out of that financially privileged class, ""Eastern Europe"" starts looking mighty attractive though.

Funnily enough, out of all those countries from the first paragraph, Estonia considers itself North European and the rest Central European and not Eastern European, since ""Eastern European"" is literally always used as a derogatory term that [it makes absolutely zero logical sense in any other way](https://imgur.com/gallery/kk6Ch1D).",European Union,/r/europe/comments/jp5cro/gdp_of_european_countries_compared_to_hollywood/gbfcnju/,LXXXVI,1604725508

1553,"The issue is complicated. On the one hand, the Western world has been preventing a truly Islamic nation from ever taking form since it collapsed the Ottoman Empire. It sees such a state as a threat to its hegemony. So they support puppet governments based on nationalistic ideals. Basically a 'divide and conquer' strategy. This leads to poverty in those countries and an outpouring of refugees that irrevocably end up going to the West. Which is turn creates another problem and leads to things such as unchecked extremism. 

If the West supported a moderate Islamic nation in forming then the world would have a centralised authority that would have the mandate in dealing with extremism and would effectively stop the refugee crisis. But of course this is seen as a bigger problem for the West for the reason that I already mentioned. Such a state would prevent the West from its worldwide hegemony, particularly in the resources sector where they play all sides off against each other for their own benefit.

Now this is 2020 and with COVID there was going to be a large increase in the number of ballots that would be mailed in. In fact this is the highest voter turnout the US has ever had. These ballots have been largely democratic because Biden urged his supporters to mail their ballots in while Trump downplayed the impact of CoVID and told his supporters to go vote in person. 

The 50 US states and some territories all have election laws that govern how voting is implemented. In anticipation of large mail in ballots some states amended laws to be able to efficiently count. Mail in ballots could be received well before Election Day but some states, like Pennsylvania, had laws that prevented them from being counted till on or after Election Day. Many people still chose to vote on Election Day in person and some states also had early voting before Election Day. These votes were counted first and reported quickly since they are automatically scanned. Some states had already started counting votes that were mailed in before Election Day.  There are different procedures in place to ensure mail in ballots are secure and hence must be verified manually to prevent fraud. 

The states that had laws preventing from counting as ballots are received are largely counting now or just didn’t have the capacity to handle the large increase in mail in ballots.

Yes, in a high-turnout election, Trump got more votes than he did in 2016 – but Biden got more votes than any presidential candidate in history, more even than the once-in-a-generation phenomenon that was Barack Obama.

What’s more, Biden looks to have done something extremely difficult and vanishingly rare, taking on and defeating a first-term president. That would ensure that Donald Trump becomes only the third elected president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to try and fail to win re-election. Trump would take his place alongside Jimmy Carter and George Bush the elder in the small club of rejected, one-term presidents. As it happens, both those men were gracious in defeat and admirable in retirement, but Trump won’t see them that way. He’ll regard them as stone-cold losers. And he’s about to be one of them, his place taken by a decent, empathic man with the first ever female vice-president at his side.""

The problem is, there is no oversight by social workers or outreach workers with respect to this cultural insulation, and since we only have haphazard attempts to integrate immigrants (at best), we in turn let them radicalise and then wonder why things boil over. 

What people do not understand is that the most sensitive and most formative time during an immigrants time is not the process, but when they actually have to start their life in this new country. The fact that people overlook this in every news of a terrorist attack, and call for closing borders to people who quite obviously need help, shows that people don’t actually know what it’s like to work with or be an immigrant.

You are welcome to source it. Flag it nsfw, in case the mods pay us a visit.

&gt;As for theorizing, the Azeri president rewards people for murdering Armenians, rather than imprisoning for it. And I'm not talking about combat here, but murdering people with an axe unrelated to combat.

I assume you mean the murder of Gurgen Margaryan back in 2006?

Do actually say that then, and don't just suggest to some incident. It makes your argument seem shaky, when it doesn't need to be.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So when we talk about him murdering Armenians, we aren't talking about hypothetical scenarios, but things that have already happened.

Murder and organized genocide is not the same thing.

Altough there is a strong argument to be made that the murder was motivated by ethnic hatred. And the subsequent reward being an encouragement of ethnic violence.

&amp;#x200B;

Some more quotes from this guy who was a **bulgarian politician, teacher in Sofia and school director in two other bulgarian towns as per his personal choice:**

**""As a Bulgarian, I would gladly go to Bulgaria if my work on the scientific search for the fate of the Bulgarian lands, especially Macedonia, is needed there.""**

**""We (in Macedonia) were more Bulgarians than those in Bulgaria""**

""**Whether we call ourselves Bulgarians or Macedonians does not matter, because we will always separate from the Serbs and have a Bulgarian identity.""**

**"" It is known that there is no Bulgarian who is not interested in the situation and the fate of that country of our homeland, which to this day groans under the yoke of Turkey. ""**

The statement this guy quoted comes from a book he wrote in 1903 where he was mad that Bulgaria was not taking more action to free Macedonia, which we did a few years after, losing 3 wars in the attempts to do so.

&gt;In 1903 on 2nd of August an uprising took a place in Krusevo. Later in September 1903 the Bulgarian prime minister said that the uprising is 200km away from Bulgarian borders and has nothing to do with Bulgaria or Bulgarian people.

Ima ask for a source on that, 90% chance it is not an accurate representation. And again in 1903 Krusevo was deep in Ottoman territory and we obviously did care as again... we fought 3 desperate wars to get it back.

&gt;They say that our identity was invented and fake and was made in 1945 but on the other hand there was a macedonian community in USA during 1903.

There were many specifically macedonian revolutionary committees still going at that time given that what is now NM was still under Ottoman rule.",Europa,/r/europe/comments/jp6fjx/today_bulgaria_has_officially_blocked_north/gbd6l4n/,dothrakipls,1604683975

Lol what? One of the main talking points of these 3 religions is that morality is absolute. There is an objective moral standard set by god. We must derive our human laws from this objective standard. The fact that modern religion changes what they perceive these moral laws to be based on current popular sentiment **is a huge argument for why these religions are bogus.** To be a defender of Christianity, or Islam, you must unequivocally hold that ancient practices of horribly immoral things like slavery and pedophilia are okay. If you want to say these things were moral then, but not now, okay your argument is now standing nothing, but to humor you, where was the divine proclamation stating this? Where did Jesus or Mohammad say ""oh yeah, btw all the stuff I'm teaching you guys is only for this historical time period, 1000 years from now it won't really apply! God is going to change his mind on what's okay and not!""

2306,"&gt; How do you explain that for months we keep on hearing of new Covid-19 cases every day, all while excess mortality drops to zero?!

The virus spreads but doesn't develop due to the increased ventilation during summer, due to more outdoor activities and leaving doors and windows open.

Fresh air works: https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20200417_04925890

&gt;Also, we know for a far that the flu is a seasonal condition. So, doesn't that make it plausible that the same applies for Covid-19 and those daily cases involve false positives?

The flu doesn't disappear during summer either, it just develops less.

&gt;Sweden's mortality declined only marginally slower.
Here's a graph comparing only Belgium &amp; Sweden :
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;time=earliest..latest&amp;country=BEL~SWE&amp;region=World
Note how there's a roughly linear decline of excess mortality between the end of April and the end of July for BOTH countries, in spite of applying a completely different strategy for combating Covid-19!

If you take the general trendline down from the peak for Sweden (it's pretty clear, fit a pen), and you go down from the Belgian peak at the same angle (move the pen), you end up in October before reaching baseline.

&gt;It depends on who you talk to. Many (if not most) people of lower intelligence instinctively sense that all this hysteria is bullshit. Many (if not most) people of high intelligence rationally see through the bullshit.
In my experience, the average / median person is mostly likely to abide to all the measures blindly, without questioning them whatsoever. In is the middle class and especially upper middle that is the most socialized element in society and the least interested as well as the least capable of questioning the narrative imposed upon them by media &amp; politicians.

Covid19 is more widespread through people of lower education, so that illustrates quite nicely that the measures work and the ones failing to implement them get infected more often.

&gt;I'm not sure how long this will last, though. There's so many cracks in the official narrative I can't imagine this can last much longer without a dam breaking somewhere... Then again, I guess I should never underestimate human stupidity, ignorance and compliance...

Take Turkey, often cited as a success story for secular Islam and an example that proves that Islam has nothing to do with suicide bombings. Fifteen percent of them believe that suicide attacks against civilians in defense of Islam are sometimes or always justified. That's 11.25 million people in Turkey alone, one of the most secular Muslim-majority countries in existence. So the point is not that this is a majority opinion, but that it is large enough to be a serious problem.

There are plenty of other surveys by PEW, WZB and many other pollsters. 

Why don't we have terrorist attacks by other immigrants, like latin americans, eastern europeans, chinese, etc?

Not that this is relevant to our discussion, but you do make me curious how you got to know him personally...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The question is why do you chose to ignore the answers from the rest of the scientific community and are only focused on a minority who seem to support your opinion? 

I don't trust any expert. I try to look at an issue from as many angles as possible and try to make my own assessment as much as I possibly can as a layman.

This whole Covid-19 crisis never made any sense from the start. And this crisis is obviously being (ab)used to push certain political agendas (the WEC's ""Great Reset"" in particular) into the mainstream and reshape the socio-economic system along very specific lines.

Then there's all the censorship of opinions that do not fit the mainstream narrative. Sure, I guess, in times of crisis we may not want to be exposed to every crazy moron expressing his opinion. But when countless of experts in a relevant field are not given a voice and censored along with the rifraff, there's something terribly wrong here.

Sure, consensus is each to achieve when you silence all dissidents opinion. But that isn't scientific consensus. That's political consensus. And this doesn't belong in a supposedly free post-enlightenment society. The way dissident opinions are treated today is ever more resembling the methods of the Spanish inquisition or Stalinist show trials. And this is not OK!

I'm totally open to acknowledging that I may be wrong here. But thusfar you haven't even come close to giving me a good reason.",,/r/europe/comments/jnk1qk/excess_mortality_in_2020_for_10_different/gb49p41/,johnslegers,1604500013

Looking back on it, what I meant to say is that the potentially higher number of children playing video games + the sheer number of searches a single child  makes relating to a single video game (I know it's anecdotal, but seriously, looking at the searches on a kid's pc is something else), possibly means measuring the ""favouritness"" of a game through increases in  google searches is not the best method.
Of course, if it were possible to discard the queries made by children you'd likely see a much more heterogeneous set of games, like you said.

In scientific matters, they absolutely are. You can't legislate truth into existence.

&gt;it’s the parliament we are talking about, a parliament that surely consulted linguistic experts for years to declare which is a dialect and which one is distintive enough to be a language!

I hope you're being sarcastic.

&gt;And it’s a dialect of italian.

It's not. It's it not up for debate or something that's nuanced enough that you could make an argument. Lombard isn't even in the same *branch* as Italian. What you're saying amounts to the same as saying French or Spanish are dialects of Italian.

&gt;it was too much influenced by standard italian and the other neighbouring dialects in the last millennium to be a language on its own

That's simply not how linguistics work. A language doesn't become a dialect of another simply by « influence », as worst it goes through creolisation. Which isn't even the case in that instance.

If there was a millennium of neighbouring dialects influencing each other, than Lombard, Ligurian and Emilian would just have equalized to one Gallo-Italic language.

Muslims are far far better than Islam. 

Despising Islam is not racism. Islam is an ideology and not a race, and is worthy of every bit of disdain, ire, criticism and mockery. 
It is a hateful miserable ideologue that continues to cause so much misery in the world.

2685,"&gt; Israel’s ties with Armenia, which has strong relations with neighboring Iran, as well as with Russia, have warmed up in recent years, and before the recall of the ambassador could have been characterized as “cordial.”

&gt; Pashinyan said the involvement of Turkey and Syrian mercenaries in the conflict has badly complicated the situation: “Their presence in the region poses a threat not only to Nagorno-Karabakh, but also Iran has stated that it views it as a threat, and Russia has stated that it views it as a threat.”

&gt; The Armenian prime minister said that while in the past there was only indirect evidence that Turkey was mobilizing Syrian mercenaries to fight in Azerbaijan, now there is concrete evidence since two mercenaries were recently captured by Nagorno-Karabakh forces.

&gt; “One of them has testified comprehensively, and said that he was living in a Turkish-controlled Syrian refugee camp. He described how he was recruited, described where they became engaged, and how they crossed the border into Turkey at an official check point, but without anyone asking them any questions or checking them.”

&gt; Pashinyan said the mercenaries were being promised $2,000 a month.

&gt; The prime minister said that what was so dangerous about this situation, and why the international community should take note and action against it, is because it represents a new Turkish modus operandi – what he called a “mechanism” – in its aim to “reinstate the Ottoman Empire, as strange as that may sound.”

&gt; This “mechanism” – recruiting mercenaries from among the Syrian population under Turkish control to advance Ankara’s foreign policy goals – has already been used in Libya, is now evident in Nagorno-Karabakh, “and who knows where it will be tried next,” he said.

&gt; “This is a totally new mechanism that has been put into place, and this mechanism may be manifested in different places and in different ways” as long as the international community does not respond.

&gt; “I am very glad that many countries in the Middle East, including many Arab countries, are making the proper assessment and calling this by its name, understanding what a threat this poses to international peace and stability,” he said.

&gt; Pashinyan said that certain “shifts are taking place in the international security system, and that those shifts also contain elements of hybrid warfare. Mercenaries are engaging in that warfare. And that hybrid warfare can be manifested in different ways – it can be manifested in ways which we see in Nagorno-Karabakh, or in ways in which we are seeing in Vienna, or in Nice, in France,” all recent sites of terror, or attempted terror acts, by Islamists.

&gt; The world needs to look at this new activity by Turkey and draw the necessary conclusions, because it will use this new way of implementing its foreign policy elsewhere as well, he predicted.

&gt; “Israel should ask itself the question – is it not fighting de facto alongside mercenaries against Nagorno-Karabakh? Is this a convenient position for it? If it is, God be with it. But I think that there will be specific consequences, and you will have to face those consequences.”",,/r/europe/comments/jnugdy/armenian_pm_to_post_israel_joins_forces_with_the/gb3r2jn/,Idontknowmuch,1604485910

2756,"&gt;And can you say that it has failed when Ankara exactly got what they wanted from EU? (Paying the money that was own). 

I can say they failed because for 20 days there were continuous attempts by over 10000 people to cross the border and only a few succeeded. And that happened with a fence in a bad state, with the river at the border having a very low level because of prolonged drought and with help send by other countries only the last days of the crisis.

Things will become more difficult with the new fence and if Europe decides to mobilize units sooner in the future even more difficult.

 

&gt;Try to be serious, please.  
&gt;  
&gt;All those tricks will be easily gamed by the migrants besides being very costly and chaotic.  
&gt;  
&gt;The only way that would make sense from a financial prospect is to systematically jail any immigrants in special prisons where they have to work to get themselves food. But this is clearly a violation of human rights.

Please tell me how can you make a wire transfer of money untraceable or the surveillance of telecommunications impossible? What you write is totally disconnected from reality.

By following the money authorities have taken down big crime networks that use sophisticated methods of money laundering and have strong connections which cover them. The vast majority of the immigrants are not big crime lords and don't even have the means to try something complicated.

Check cases of immigrants who have committed terrorist acts or violent crimes and you'll see that in most of them police has collected details for their criminal record in their home countries, for those people who previously were here with a false ID.

But even if surveillance fails there is an even easier way.

And of course no, there is no need to put them in prison. That would be anyway counterproductive when you have thousands of people awaiting deportation.

You have just to enforce the law that is in place for all citizens, including immigrants. In order for a person to make any transaction with governmental agencies, banks etc. proper identification is needed. If people who deny identifying themselves were blocked from having access to these services (as it would happen to any other of the citizens), they would in the end leave because they wouldn't have a way to make any profit. Of course even for people who block their identification we should keep providing food and shelter. But without the ability to send money back home or the ability to earn any benefits from the government, most of them would leave and surely new migrants wouldn't be interested to come if they knew benefits are out of the question for failed asylum seekers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Well actually not. Erdogan ceased to send migrants once he was able to renegotiate the terms of the 2016 agreement: the main concern was that EU didn't give the money it promised. Once Ankara got reassured on the matter, they stopped sending refugees. 

Maybe, but all these 3 weeks the efforts were ongoing, almost no one passed. If a joint EU response takes place the next time, then the border will be even more safe. But even this time when only Greek authorities protected the border, only a very small percentage succeeded to cross to Greece.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;The New York Times article provided above clearly explain that France's stance was isolated among major European countries. The reason is that Turkey and France are clashing against each other for years in Syria and Libya. France also has close ties with Egypt which is another regional challenger.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both France and Turkey are in competition for the MENA region leadership. It doesn't make really point, especially when France's position has been drastically weakened in Europe's FP after the French-led Liyban intervention in 2011.  
&gt;  
&gt;The NYT article stated that France was once again to pursue its very own interests.

Also, Muslim peoples have been invading and trying to take European lands... Wow! What do you think they saw the crusades as? Tourism?! Both Christians and Muslims were, at times, at war with each other and tried to take each other's land.

Like I said earlier, both Islam and Christianity tried to (and still try) to expand their respective religions: Islam expanded in Northern Africa and Asia Christianity expanded (with equally forceful means) in Europe, the Americas, Southern Africa, and some parts of Asia. Your conjecture that Islam expanded for the sole purpose of expanding Islam and Christianity expanded as a secondary measure is unsupported. War is an insanely expensive enterprise and no State can function if its sole purpose is to wage war.

Saying that the Enlightenment was the first ""post Christian movement"" is wrong, because (as you should know, Mr. Self-proclaimed-Historian) many Enlightenment thinkers were Christian. They disagree with the Church as an institution, but they idea that they rejected the religion is absurd. John Locke even wanted ""unprejudiced examination of the Word of God alone"". It is true that the ideas of deism and atheism were developed in the Enlightenment, but far from most Enlightenment thinkers were deist or atheist.

Which takes me back to my main point, which you seemed to miss: Islam has problems with fanaticism and people reading waaaay too much into an old book; Christianity had the same problem (and there are still such people). Therefore, with a reform of Islamic society (which some Muslim countries have already implemented such as Tunesia and former Turkey and Persia).

As you’ve agreed there’s no such thing as a progressive Islam then it’s done. If you practice Islam you are a fundamentalist. That is entirely the point - you’re arguing against yourself.

To be honest, this kind of reckoning has been a long time coming for the Democratic establishment which relies almost entirely on its semi-mythical rainbow coalition to shut up and vote for them no matter what.

COVID itself also exposed a kind of social dichotomy where Democrats would talk a big game about needing to lockdown and torpedo the economy, and then continue getting their private haircuts and going to restaurants and enjoying their government pay while the country withered (and also the fact that they seemed blithe about lockdowns when it came time for people to hold mass gatherings in favor of left-wing causes, but I digress). And then on top of that, they decided to play chicken with COVID stimulus by quibbling over the fact the second round of stimulus would include fewer infusions of cash for (primarily democratic) counties while many Americans simply wanted a check and another round of unemployment insurance.

Trump has pretty consistently failed on COVID, that much is not in doubt. What is truly remarkable is how the Democrats not only looked this gift horse in the mouth, but spat in it for good measure.

This isn't the 15th century... religion isn't some sort of plague that people have. It's a part of their identity, core beliefs, and not inherently worse off than believing in nothing at all. You're setting a constant for atheism that doesn't exist to use as an objectively superior position than that of any faith.

It is funny people compare it to Swastikas really. In the Western culture, at best, it was a sign of good fortune. While Bozkurt (Grey wolf) was the common main totem of all Turkic tribes as a whole. You can't just expect Turks to give up such a symbol over a racist group.

And before you may think it is a forgotten ancestry, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/E1_5_TL_%C3%B6n_y%C3%BCz.jpg this was our currency till 1937. 

Anyway i could talk more but you get the idea. A symbol that is more important than literally any other symbol in Turkic history ain't gonna disappear because some far right organization named themselves after it.

Is showing religious caricatures a transgression of this principle ? Hard to say, I don't think there have been any case law yet on the matter. 

My personal opinion is that it depends on the context. If a professor clearly manifests a dislike for Islam, and explicitly condemns this religion on the basis that it diverges from their own religious beliefs, thereby showing caricatures of the Prophet as a means to convey said beliefs, then he would be in breach of neutrality of the public service.

However, in the case of Samuel Paty (the murdered teacher), the intentions of showing these caricatures were of purely educational purpose, as a means of explaining what freedom of speech was in the context of a civics class. The position of the teacher, therefore, was not so much « I support these grotesque cartoons », but rather « newspapers have the freedom of criticising religions in France by means of grotesque cartoons ».",,/r/europe/comments/jn79fp/macron_on_the_caricatures_and_freedom_of/gb31vig/,titus_berenice,1604465418

And along with secularism what it means is that the state cannot officially address the nation as groups of sub communities. As Macron reminded us again in Nice recently “in France there is only one community and that is the national community”. 

It’s a much stricter view than the anglo-saxon one and requires any newcomers to truly merge within France and make its history their own. It’s romantic in a way. But hard to swallow in an individualistic world. In the UK every sub community is overly respected and as such given disproportionate influence. The issue is the long game. What is even the “raison de vivre” of a nation if it is just a mix of communities living side by side rather than together? I think the only end for this is civil war and the US might not be too far from it.

There is no clear date, but pretty much everyone agrees she was underage.

&gt;Aisha's age at the time of her marriage is frequently mentioned in Islamic literature.[16] According to John Esposito, Aisha was married to Muhammad in Mecca in 624CE, after Hegira to Medina and the Battle of Badr.[29] Several scholars interpret this to indicate that she reached puberty at this age,[15][16][30][31] although her age at the time is the subject of dispute. Al-Tabari says she was nine at the time her marriage was consummated.[32] Sahih al-Bukhari's hadith says ""that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old.""[33] Other sources differ on the age of marriage, but agree that the marriage was not consummated at the time of the marriage contract.[34] All biographical information on Muhammad and his companions was first recorded over a century after his death,[35] but the ahadith[36] and sīra (traditional Islamic biographies of Muhammad) provide records of early Islam through an unbroken chain of transmission. Various ahadith stating that Aisha was either nine or ten at the time of her consummation come from collections with sahih status, meaning they are regarded as reputable by most Sunni Muslims.[33][37] Other traditional sources also mention Aisha's age. The sīra of Ibn Ishaq edited by Ibn Hisham states that she was nine or ten years old at the consummation.[38] The historian al-Tabari also states that she was nine.[39] Marriage at a young age was not unheard of at the time, and Aisha's marriage to Muhammad may have had a political connotation, as her father Abu Bakr was an influential man in the community.[40] Abu Bakr, on his part, may have sought to further the bond of kinship between Muhammad and himself by joining their families together in marriage via Aisha. Leila Ahmed notes that Aisha's betrothal and marriage to Muhammad are presented as ordinary in Islamic literature, and may indicate that it was not unusual for children to be married to their elders in that era.[41]",,/r/europe/comments/jn79fp/macron_on_the_caricatures_and_freedom_of/gb2afw0/,xmarwinx,1604449798

Considering and combining the above, Charlie Hebdo commited blasphemy, but that's not illegal, and Charlie Hebdo didn't use hate speech, simply because it's not calling for hate towards Muslims.

3185,"There's no « Germanic » influence in French, or rather not any more than in other Romance languages. The entirety of the « unique » features of French (which are really shared with all Gallo-Romance languages, up to Lombard, Friulan and so on) are down to the Gallic substrate and the tonal reduction that slowly crept in since the Middle Ages.

Your anecdotal evidence is pointless. Statistical analysis of Romance languages show very little difference in terms of lexicon between French, Italian, Catalan etc. Spanish and Portuguese are more outlying.

&gt;french resembles a lot a kind of vulgar latin spoken by the franks

No, it doesn't. Unless by « Franks » you mean Gallo-Romans like what it meant historically, rather than Rhine delta Germanic tribes.

&gt;So it’s natural that minor the distance is, more the language is similar.

That's not how languages work. Linguistic conservatism isn't a function of distance from the geographical origin of the language. In fact the opposite happens more often that not, with the cradle of the language being the area that's the most demographically/economically relevant, and as a result where the language mutates the fastest.

That's why you've got rural English accents similar to 17th. century London ones, why Québeckers kept habits from urban 18th c. French, why the Southern Chinese dialects are closer to Middle Chinese than Northern ones, why all the most archaic Romance dialects and languages occur in mountains and islands...

&gt;Dante even called what he wrote “vulgar” and it is intelligible italian.

It's the other way around. Dante didn't write in intelligible Italian, **Italian was standardized after Dante** (and Petrarch).",France,/r/europe/comments/jn79fp/macron_on_the_caricatures_and_freedom_of/gb2bf7i/,Bayart,1604450358

He wants to, to raise cash that is needed elsewhere. What public company or asset was privatized under his government? The national gambling monopoly? That was was important to keep due to its strategic importance /s

&gt; He reduced corporate taxes, defunded public administration and gave BIG BIG BIG money to big corporations.

Yes, because corporate taxes in France are pretty high, and when you want to boost the economy to combat atrocious youth unemployment rates, it helps. What ""BIG BIG BIG"" money did he gave to corporations? To stop them from going under from Covid? I guess he should have left them to go bankrupt and make everyone need unemployment benefits, that would have helped the economic recovery in the eventual post-Covid world. 

Ecology fully agree, he has been very shit. Maybe due to the massive Gilets Jaunes protests which started somewhat anti-ecology, maybe because he doesn't really care.

3301,"Criticism of religion is okay, and everyone should be able to do so without repercussion in any democratic country. 

However, there is a difference between good criticism (the one that advance us as a society), and disrespect. In that regards, I'm more leaning towards what Trudeau said: ""[We owe it to ourselves to act with respect for others and to seek not to arbitrarily or unnecessarily injure those with whom we are sharing a society and a planet.](https://www.news18.com/news/world/cant-shout-fire-in-a-movie-theatre-trudeau-condemns-france-attacks-but-says-free-speech-has-limits-3027023.html)""

We just have to respect each other, that's it. If I know that a provocative thing I will say will hurt someone or a community, I will just respect it. 
For example, a transexual wants me to use ""She"" as a pronoun, I won't use ""He"" just to provoque, because I know they will get offended and they may respond in a way I won't like it.

The people most affected by what the Irish government does are the population of Ireland, not the population of Ireland who also have Irish citizenship.

They pay Irish tax rates to the Irish government, are required to follow Irish laws, send their kids to schools following the Irish curriculum, use the HSE, ect.

Of course we could write and approve laws to strip any potential terrorists (mind you that's what he was back than - a potential terrorist) of citizenship and put them in jail (because what else you can do with an Austrian-born citizen, deport him to some country he was never affiliated with? I know this one allegedly had double citizenship, inherited from parents I guess, but what about those that don't? The law must be universal to work for every case to have any practical value). Now this could work for these cases, but it would also shift the country closer to an oppressive regime. And what if than another attack happens by someone who hasn't been labeled a potential terrorist and put in jail? Will you approve another, stricter law? Let's say to deport or put in jail everyone who practices Islam or further down the line is a Muslim?

No, italians generally feel the closeness, we call you the cugini transalpini, but i must admit that lots of italians have a bit of resentment.

Mostly for the politics: the french and UK killed gheddafi, that had favourable commerces with us for the oil, and they left lybia in a mess that led to illegal immigration in which italy was left totally alone. 

Another less known thing is the massacre of ustica, a plane of 81 italian citizens was drown in the 80s due to a french missile that mistook the traiettory, they wanted to get a jet in which there was gheddafi. The families got their funds only in 2007. 

Or, more in the past, the napoleon art robberies: 200 out of 400 (not the gioconda, legally bought) art pieces stay unshamefully in french museums. 

After napoleone’s fall, all the countries got their art back aside from italy, that got only half, mostly the venetians who had austrian troups that went to paris and took them back. Italy, not being a state, had nor the rapresentance in the council of vienna and nor the military forces to get that half back. 

Tuscan pieces stayed there also because the tuscan royals said that that pictures in france would have shown their cultural superiority to france, and the pope allowed other stuff to stay there because he wanted to underline the church power. 

But for example the nozze di cana del veronese, a 9 m venetian painting that dinon, the director of the louvre, had to return, wasn’t returned because he falsely claimed that it was “too heavy to move”. The austrians got in exchange another italian painting. Also the french made lots of resistance in restitutions, with some paintings being lost or ruined.

“There is no compulsion where the religion is concerned.” (Holy Quran: 2/ 256)

“You cannot guide those you would like to but God guides those He wills. He has best knowledge of the guided.” (Holy Quran/28: 56)

“God does not forbid you from being good to those who have not fought you in the religion or driven you from your homes, or from being just towards them. God loves those who are just.” (Surat al-Mumtahana, 8)

“We have appointed a law and a practice for every one of you. Had God willed, He would have made you a single community, but He wanted to test you regarding what has come to you. So compete with each other in doing good. Every one of you will return to God and He will inform you regarding the things about which you differed.” (Surat al-Ma’ida, 48)

""Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians—whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve"" (Qu'ran 2:62, 5:69, and many other verses).

"". . . and nearest among them in love to the believers will you find those who say, 'We are Christians,' because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant"" (Qu'ran 5:82).

""O you who believe! Be helpers of God—as Jesus the son of Mary said to the Disciples, 'Who will be my helpers in (the work of) God?' Said the disciples, 'We are God's helpers!' Then a portion of the Children of Israel believed, and a portion disbelieved. But We gave power to those who believed, against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed"" ( Qu'ran 61:14).

 “The Christians… respected my alliance. They recognized my rights. They fulfilled the promises that they had made during our meeting. They assisted the lieutenants that I had sent to the frontiers.

 “If a Christian woman enters a Muslim household, she shall be received with kindness, and she shall be given opportunity to pray in her church; there shall be no dispute between her and a man who loves her religion.

 “If a monk or pilgrim seeks protection, in mountain or valley, in a cave or in tilled fields, in the plain, in the desert, or in a church, I am behind them, defending them from every enemy; I, my helpers, all the members of my religion and all my followers, for they \[the monks and the pilgrims\] and my proteges and my subjects.” – (The Covenant of the Prophet Muhammad with the Monks of Mount Sinai)

 “All pious believers shall deem it their bounden duty to defend believers and to aid them wheresoever they may be, whether far or near, and throughout Christendom shall protect the places where they conduct worship and those where their monks and priests dwell. 

everywhere, in mountains, or in the plains, in towns and in waste places, in deserts, and wheresoever they may be, that people shall be protected, both in their faith and in their property, both in the West and in the East, both on sea and land.” (The Covenant of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of Persia) 

 “No Christian shall be brought by force to confess Islam, and no disputes except over the better things shall be envisaged in with them. Muslims shall extend over the Christians everywhere the arm of mercy and kindness, protecting them from the exactions of oppressors.” (The Covenant of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of Persia)

 “The Muslims must not abandon the Christians, neglect them, and leave them without help and assistance since I have made this pact with them on behalf of Allah to ensure that whatever good befell Muslims it would befall them as well and that whatever harm befell Muslims would befall them as well.” (The Covenant of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of Najran)

But the catholic Church, which is an [international racket and hides pedophiles and rapists in their midst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases) is any better just because it is ""European""? The Tribalism in this line of reasoning is laughable.

&gt; Classifying any religious doctrine that puts any moral demands and expectations on non-believers as hate speech and process it accordingly. 

You know that you are not allowed to play loud music or have Dancefestivals at quite a number of religious (= exclusively christian) [Holidays in Germany, by Law](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesetzliche_Feiertage_in_Deutschland#Stille_Tage)?

Are these Laws Hate speech then?

&gt; Prevent asylum seekers from free movement during the process. Massively increase asylum process staff and speed up the process for the legitimate ones. 

Lol, here we go, the racism comes out to play. Why target the socially weak, you heartless fool? Why not try to get them (or their kids) on board, instead of antagonizing them and pushing them even further away? 

""Look, western value sare so great and enlightened (just pay no attention how Christianity gets a super special treatment from all of these oh so secular governments), and to prove how humanistic and enlightenend we are, we will treat you like criminals, because we are afraid of your ~~skincolor~~ religion"".

Yeah, that will help...

Was shooting justified? Absolutely not. Does this mean Charlie Hebdo was right to make caricatures with a purpose to offend someone? Still no. This is where the respect I was talking about comes into play. Again, for example if I don't respect someone as a person and verbally harass them it doesn't mean I deserve to die, but it doesn't make me right too. It means that I should be criticised for my actions. And criminals should also be judged for their actions.

Terror and crime doesn't have religion, ethnicity or gender. A lot of people forget this easily. Can they be justified by religion? Ideally no they shouldn't be. However we must not forget that what people consider today as mere religions were laws for humanity. Those laws gradually changed as humanity progressed. Despite that even today laws are not perfect, neither is religion. Religions undoubtedly have their faults and they should definitely be criticised for them. But the criticism should also be constructive, not destructive.

What Charlie Hebdo did was solely with the purpose of offending, no more no less. Was it not a right thing to do? It wasn't. Does it justify the shooting? Absolutely, a 100% not.",,/r/europe/comments/jn79fp/macron_on_the_caricatures_and_freedom_of/gb0msdj/,Sad_Mitochondria13,1604420614

For example: facio in latin means “i make”. In italian it’s “faccio”. It is obvious that “je fais” comes from “facio” like “faccio” but the latter is more similar to it than the french version.
Or “i say” both “io dico” and “je dis” come from latin “ego dico” but the former is closer.

Or ratio, rationis (reason) italian “ragione” is closer to it (specifically the ablative “ratione”) than french “raison”. The devil stays in the details.


Also there are more words of foreign influence in french or spanish that modify the lexicon (italian has a lot but not like the others), for example the moors influenced a lot spanish vocabulary, french resembles a lot a kind of vulgar latin spoken by the franks. It is simply due to the distance. The first territories included in rome where the ones of the peninsula, were also there were other italic populations before. So it’s natural that minor the distance is, more the language is similar.

3623,"Extreme right: Head of ""Zouaves Paris"" extremist group heads to war in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Marc de Cacqueray-Valmenier, leader of the violent right-wing extremist group, has announced he's joined the ranks of the Armenian army. The group has in the past expressed their support for the breakaway region several times.

Cacqueray-Valmenier has evidently moved away from mere words to deeds, announcing on his Instagram-account that he's joined on the side of the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh in their conflict with neighbouring Azerbaijan. The ""Zouaves Paris""-group has on several occassions already expressed their support for the breakaway region on their usual communications channels, placing the conflict into a wider conflict with Islam and the world's Muslims. The group has stressed that ""the future of our continent and civilization is at stake in Nagorno-Karabakh"".

To illustrate his commitment to the cause of the Armenians, Cacqueray-Valmenier posted a photo of himself in a military uniform while holding an assaukt rifle in his hands, presumably a Kalashnikov. On his helmet he bore the Armenian flag and the totenkopf - the skull and crossbones of Nazi Germany's SS. 

The photo was captioned: ""Direction: the front"". 

The extremist leader also shared his desire to form a ""foreign volunteer legion"" in collaboration with local authorities, but expressed that his followers should not travel to Armenia in fear of them being refused at the border.

The call for war in Armenia is the latest in a long far-right extremist tradition. During the 1970s several dussin members of the French extremist group joined the ranks of the Christian Phalanges in Lebanon, then they could be seen alongside the Karen in Burma and the Unita in Angola. More recently the conflict in Ukraine drew French nationalist extremists to join both sides of the conflict. Cacqueray-Valmenier confirmed to us at Libération that he had visited Ukraine last winter and the ""Zouaves Paris"" have more than once expressed their support and admiration for the neo-nazi Azov regiment.

When Libération's reporters met Cacqueray-Valmenier in 2019 he expressed in no uncertain terms that he was indeed ""a facist"", but he refuted the label for his group, which has spearheaded right-wing extremist violence in the French capital. He claimed the ""Zouaves Paris"" are a small group dedicated to ""holding the streets"".

There is no room for logic in a faith-based discussion, otherwise faith in a benevolent fatherly deity that loves and cares for ""all of his children"", yet refuses to help them in any tangible way, allows unchecked evil and pain, and punishes those who can't bring themselves to believe in him with torture for ETERNITY...would be seen as ludicrous. So to these believers, forcing their values on everyone else is not only obviously the correct course of action, it is in fact an attempt to save these sinners' souls, whether they like it or not.

More importantly, though, they see their actions as defending their God. I'm not really sure why an omnipotent, omniscient deity would need humans to cut each other's heads off to protect him, or his prophet, but here we are.

3687,"Their softening on the EU has been a long term process. If you look at polling and election results for SF north and south you see first a very strong correlation between the GFA and increasing their vote. Once there in the south they stuck at a ceiling of about 6-7% until the crisis in banking lead to IMF involvement in 2010 which boosted SF to about 10%. From the 2011 election onwards they were quickly and consistently in a range between 15-20% and only sometimes breaking 25% until the end of 2019 when their current boost in popularity began. 

In the meantime of all this they advocated the soft eurosceptic position in every single referendum relating to Europe until the 2016 Brexit referendum in the north. Their position on that was entirely down to the complication of the border given that they still claim to agree with much of their earlier criticisms of the EU. Their talk of the EU is entirely down to the politics around Brexit in the north. 

There's nothing to indicate that it was their euroscepticism that held them at 10% and nothing to indicate that softening on the EU is what let them break past 15% back when Labour entered government with Fine Gael.

In front of a bunch of children? Do I need to remind you about the COUNTLESS men who punched, kicked, stoned and burned a woman on the streets a few years back simply because someone spread a rumour that she burned the Quran? Those were the average Muslims right there, people who were walking around, minding their own business, not a single “terrorist” thought in their mind but a violent, twisted need to protect their religion and their prophet. Those are people who would pass as normal, peaceful believers of a religion but all it takes is the opportunity for them to act the way they did. People supported that barbaric murder! The backlash only came when they learned the woman didn’t actually burn anything. What’s the likelihood that all those people were terrorists? Are you gonna say all those random strangers with no connection to each other also don’t represent Islam? Cuz it feels to me like Islam doesn’t represent Islam. If only you and your westernized values of mutual respect and freedom represent Islam, then what are you gonna do with the other billions of Muslims who think YOU don’t represent Islam? 

You can’t blame people for being scared of immigration and Muslims taking over when it honestly feels like some people want to turn western countries into the same countries they fled from, using the same violent tactics that their oppressors did. There is something about Islam that leads people to do these things, something insidious that needs to be addressed and not dismissed like you’re doing. “Well but that’s the minority!”, yet the majority of terrorists are Muslim. What’s to say about a religion where it’s minority is responsible for the majority of terrorist attacks? Are you still going to pretend there’s nothing wrong? Doesn’t the Quran allow this behaviour when Muslims are being threatened? Isn’t that exactly that jihadists believe?

3712,"I’m sure this will get buried, but it’s an issue that I have considerable personal experience with and feel the need to post.

I came to Europe from the US near the start of the first huge wave of refugees back in ~2015 and have lived here since. I studied German with many refugees and then started working in education/social welfare in Germany and Austria. As a broke AF 20 something, I ended up living and working in the poorer parts of the cities I lived in. Growing up in a very rough part of the US I wasn’t too concerned about the dangers presented, and I’m a somewhat big guy, not someone you’d immediately target to rob or anything. Because of this I ended up living comfortably in the middle of the “Parallel Society” of Muslim Turks (and later more Arabs) that are the breeding grounds for religious extremists. The term “Parallel Society” isn’t an exaggeration, these communities function almost separately from mainstream society. Next to no German spoken, Turkish flags everywhere, if you were on GeoGuesser you’d never guess you were in Western Europe.

Since I’m not German, the people in the neighborhood were considerably more welcoming than if I were. The amount people I’ve met who utterly HATE and I mean HATE Germans, western values, anything even possibly critical of Islam is shocking. I won’t bother with specifics because they sound so egregious many people just wouldn’t believe me. 

Europeans reading this may think “Ugh, typical American probably has a prejudice against Muslims/brown people”. I don’t but I’ll also counter with *You don’t know them*. You don’t meet them at Uni, or in bars, clubs, the grocery store, because *they want nothing to do with you*. This is especially true for European women who are viewed as something between a whore to be sexually conquered to a socially and morally degenerate European to be avoided at all costs.

The sad truth is that nothing will change. For politicians and educators it’s career suicide to openly address issues that we see day in and day out. The only immediate solution is to invest heavily in infrastructure and education, but it’ll take generations to acclimate these communities to their surrounding cultures.",,/r/europe/comments/jn79fp/macron_on_the_caricatures_and_freedom_of/gazxk9z/,CaucasianDelegation,1604406139

it does, especially in France where they have all kinds of restrictions on freedom of speech, most famous one being Holocaust denial (you can actually end up in jail for that).

So the logical conclusion would be to either create law that makes it illegal to  do/say something that is very important to muslim minority, like insulting the prophet.
