86,"The German government uses abstention votes most often when one party in the coalition is for the EU legislation and the other party is against it. Their coalition agreement says that German has to vote abstention in this case. To say that the government of Germany opposed the act would be a lie because only one party in government opposed the act and the other one supported it. 

Another case of abstentions can be that a country thinks that some provisions are a real improvement of the status quo and good, but some other provisions in some other areas are negative for the country and bad, so they abstain when it comes to the act as a whole. To say that they oppose the act would be a lie because they support one important piece of it and oppose another piece.

An abstention is a no vote, during the voting process they ask for abstentions and no votes separately and they are published separately. Abstentions have a different meaning than a no vote. A no vote means opposition to an act, while an abstention means that you are undecided either because you could not agree in the government or because the act has good and bad provisions.

Only when you want to determine if there is a majority of yes votes have no votes and abstentions the same effect because they both are not yes votes. That does not mean that they are the same. Just like apples are not the same as oranges just because they are both not bananas. 

For this project, I did not want to determine which countries were in favour of EU legislation (only for this question have no votes the same effect as abstentions). I wanted to determine which countries opposed EU legislation. For this question, I could only counted no votes because only no votes mean opposition. Yes votes have the same effect as abstentions because they are both not no votes. 

Another question could be how many countried were undecided. In that case, I would count only abstentions. And look at that: Yes votes and no votes would have the same effect for this question because they are both not abstentions! But that does not mean that yes votes and no votes are the same in general!

&gt; Abstentions are for people like you. A government can go with an abstention, because it satisfies people like you by not being a no vote, while having the effect of a no vote. This also means that people who aren't paying attention to politics can be much more easily swayed with ""oh, but we didn't actually vote 'no' on this legislation"". Politicians love being able to twist facts like this.

I have never thought ""I hope my government votes with abstention here"". I do not have to make compromises with coalition partners in order to form my opinion so it is relatively easy to come to a clear opinion. If I want something then I always want them to either vote with yes or no, so I am always disappointed when they vote abstention.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ceffl7/european_union_how_often_each_member_state_was/euiwqbw/,staplehill,1563856983

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofoil

&gt; A hydrofoil is a lifting surface, or foil, that operates in water. They are similar in appearance and purpose to aerofoils used by aeroplanes. Boats that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils. As a hydrofoil craft gains speed, the hydrofoils lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds.

243,"&gt;Mate your arguments make no sense to me so this is going to be my last reply. If you agree with what I said about those other countries, then the boundary you're trying to establish between what you call a ""colony"" and a country does not exist, and is therefore meaningless. Almost every modern country was established through elements of what you have described as colonisation. Literally the only thing you've said to make Thrace special is that you personally take exception to its being conquered by an ""Asian"" country from a few miles away. **That's enough to make it qualitatively a ""colony"" for you, which is ridiculous.**

There was nothing special about Thrace, that was literally my point, it's a colony like any other. When other countries held territories in other continents it didn't make those countries part of those continents. UK wasn't Asian or American or Australian. Same thing with Thrace and Turkey. The one who makes Thrace special is *you* buy derailing the topic to irrelevant stuff.

&gt; You can just say that without writing pages of confusing and tenuous geographical justifications you've pulled from your backside. 

It's became tenuous for you after you started to compare it with irrelevant examples.

&gt; I didn't say Thrace was Asian, I said it was situated within Europe, which is why Turkey is trans-continental. 

And France is trans-continental, and UK, and Netherlands, and US, and Spain... sure. Everywhere it's simply a country that has conquered territories outside its continent but Turkey is *trans-continental*. I guess because it has moon on it's flag.

&gt; Yes, obviously, despite the fact that part of Turkey is literally in Europe. And you can say that as much as you want, doesn't change the fact that European Turkey (aka Eastern Thrace) exists. 

French Guiana exists. As do many other territories on other continents belonging to these countries.

I should note that after reading /r/ukpolitics a bit, I have discovered that false dichotomies of the form ""We do X, let's fund the NHS instead"" seem to be something of a magic slogan in British politics.

Finally figured it out after looking at a list of top concerns polled among members of both parties, and the NHS was a top-three concern for voters for both Big Two parties, and pretty much unique in that.

An open society is a greater good than complete individual freedom on dress choice. We already impose restrictions on nudity too, on the other extreme, for hygiene reasons first and foremost.

Germany built nuclear capacity much faster between 1975 and 1985 than they are building renewable today. The energywende is literally \*strictly inferior\* to their own past nuclear build.

And that build was not even close to counting as a serious push. Sweden built nuclear capacity over six times faster than Germany is building wind and solar.

Re: Why wind is better.

It is not about the cost of the last kwh of wind produced, it is about the distance in time from when it is produced and when it is required, and wind will always be extremely superior in this regard (in Poland)   because solar produces almost the entirety of its output in summer. That means monstrous storage costs. 

Nuclear does not need gas. Nuclear needs storage. Just like wind does, it just needs much less of it. 

I do not consider natural gas acceptable, so yes, there needs to be some storage. I just care about what it costs.",,/r/europe/comments/cfwj3a/poland_set_to_delay_eu_deal_on_2050_climate/euhmwq5/,Izeinwinter,1563830281

&gt;But neither are the militias that Turkey is sponzoring in Syria.

Of course not. Initially, they have been armed and trained by joint efforts of USA and Turkey. They proved to be useless in combat against ISIS, since you know, they resemble ISIS at best guess. USA abandoned that plan and wanted Turkey to put boots on the ground, which we refused for several reasons.

Turkey has been struggling with insurgency for a couple of decades, and PKK used Iraq and Syria to get in and out of Turkey to carry out attacks. They have bases in mountains of Iraq and Syria, which is the main reason why TAF couldn't destroy them completely. AKP thhought it would be best to let ISIS and KCK slaughter each other and benefit from it by doing simply nothing. 

&gt;The ugly truth is that nobody really has a moral high ground in Syria, including Turkey who can't be bothered to do the job itself and rather unleashes a bunch of islamist radicals on the locals.

I know westerners think that we were eager to invade Afrin etc. but people were extremely cautious and really not that eager to send the army outside our borders. That's why AKP tried to stick to the initial plan and let TFSA do the heavy work.

435,"The problem that people still don't understand the impact of the £350m a week figure and think that more effort devoted to 'debunking' it would help is a great demonstration of why Juncker intervening would have only helped the Leave side.

The £350m figure was an ingenious campaign tactic. If the correct figure had been used, the debate would have gone thus:

Leave: We pay [A meaninglessly large amount of money] per week to the EU, let's fund the NHS instead!

Remain: We get benefits worth far more, and leaving wouldn't allow that money to go to the NHS. That [money amount] buys us...

Whereas with an incorrect figure, the debate went:

Leave: We pay [A meaninglessly large amount of money] per week to the EU, let's fund the NHS instead!

Remain: Aha! Your numbers are wrong! We actually pay [A slightly smaller yet still meaninglessly large amount of money] to the EU a week.

Leave: We stand by our claim that it's [original huge sum]

Remain: No it's [slightly lower huge sum]

So both sides spent huge amount of airtime essentially giving variations on the message that being in the EU is very expensive, which is great for Leave, but a disaster for Remain.

Having Juncker chime in with 'Actually you send us [a huge amount of money]' and generating yet more headlines to that effect while also adding to the 'foreign interference in our democracy' narrative wouldn't have done anything but help boost Leave.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/cgavgc/jeanclaude_juncker_says_his_biggest_regret_was/euh9e6p/,Rulweylan,1563823244

585,"\&gt;When in reality Greece has the lowest household debt in Europe, and the crisis was from government spending not household debt

&amp;#x200B;

No no, that was part of the story, the greeks put 25% of their GDP on the credit card, because no one pays taxes thus people can buy two houses and porsche cayennes debt free whilst retiring at 55. Getting people in the north who could in their experience barely afford to get by in the crisis to bail Greece out would be impossible.

Debt restructuring/default would have been the correct thing to do but given the climate at the time it was politically impossible. Therefore I am neutral on blame.

608,"&gt; No, a simple understanding of how trade works claims that.

&gt;Its as simple as that. The same thing that makes it economically feasible to ship 70,000 sheep halfway across the world, is the same things that will make it economically necessary that they get there alive.

&gt;A 5 year old could understand this simple concept. 

And yet you seem to have a very poor understanding of it.

The entire prison systems primary concern is rehabilitation into to society. If you treat people like animals while locked up, they will act like animals when let loose again. You can't expect someone to have their decency stripped away from them, not having the opportunity to educate themselves and form social bonds and expect them to come out of prison like a reformed human being. The statistics just don't support this conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

The Norwegian prison system is built around normalizing the prison experience, to make it as close as society should be functioning. Treating the prisoners well will make them extend that humanity to other people when they get out of jail. Having access to basic amenities is also a big part of this, as well as having access to education to expand their opportunities when they are let out.

From Wikipedia (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_Norway):

The indeterminate penalty (civilian penal code), called ""preventive detention"" (Norwegian: forvaring), is set at up to 21 years' imprisonment, with no eligibility for parole for a time period not exceeding 10 years. If the prisoner is still considered dangerous after serving the original sentence, the detention can be extended by five years at a time. Renewal of the detention every five years can in theory result in actual life imprisonment. Preventive detention is used when the prisoner is deemed a danger to society and there is a great chance of his committing violent crimes in the future. However, after the minimum time period has elapsed, the offender can petition for parole once every year, and this may be granted if it is determined that he is no longer a danger to society.",,/r/europe/comments/cgb0kg/today_8_years_ago_77_people_lost_their_lives_in/eufyf40/,EternalMagician,1563795034

And that was my point. Croats (no matter from where) decided to join to finally have a voice and be equals. Serbs saw themselves as winners in WW1 and Yugoslavia as Greater Serbia. And this is why we have dead people on the day the country was formed..... Banovina was an attempt (many years later) to finally settle desputes between Croats and Serbs, but it was doomed to fail because it was too late (if you ask me).

Tito insisted on joint fight and brought back many territories sold by Croats traitors..... Tito fought both Serbian nationalism (when he removed Ranković) and Croatian nationalism (Croatian spring).

Poland’s opposition struggles for traction in rural heartlands

Ruling party’s social programmes put Civic Platform in shade


July 21, 2019 5:00 pm by Monika Pronczuk and Evon Huber in Nidzica

Nidzica is known as “the gateway to Masuria”, Poland’s lake region popular with tourists. But locals caution against the state of the water in the only lake nearby, and in the middle of the holiday season tourists are scarce.

Three hours north of booming Warsaw, the town of 13,000 is emblematic of another Poland, where people are poorer, conservative values hold sway and the governing Law and Justice party has overwhelming support.

If Poland’s opposition want to oust Law and Justice in elections this October, it will have to do better in towns such as Nidzica

Jacek Kosmala, Nidzica’s mayor, won election with an endorsement from Civic Platform, Poland’s ruling party until 2014. But he said the centre-right party had ignored his calls to do more to support people in poorer towns like his — and now the region had become a stronghold of Law and Justice, which has wooed poorer Poles with policies such as its “500 Plus” child benefit.

“When Civic Platform was in power, I kept telling them to do something for entrepreneurs, for working people. The labour costs in Poland are so high! They didn’t do it — and shortly after Law and Justice introduced 500 Plus,” he said in an interview. “And now people keep voting for them.”

Barbara, a nurse in a local hospital whose children have recently returned from working abroad, said she liked Law and Justice’s policies allowing earlier retirement and child benefit. “If you are willing to work hard, you can have a decent life here. And thanks to the government, many things improved in recent years: we have better roads, the town looks much prettier,” she said.

She said she had not yet decided for whom to vote in October but was sure it would not be Civic Platform: “They did not give anything to ordinary people.”

Zdzislaw Golebiewski, a retired navy officer, said: “You cannot even imagine how poor this area was before. The previous government cared just about accumulating money, and about people from big cities.”

Civic Platform, the largest opposition party and the only one likely to be able to form a government instead of Law and Justice, is better placed in some of the country’s wealthier, more liberally-minded regions. But there are questions over whether policies that play well there will also appeal in more conservative regions.

Grzegorz Schetyna, Civic Platform’s leader, last week presented an agenda that seemed designed to appeal more towards leftwing voters, including the legalisation of same-sex civil unions, preserving an extra pension payment each year and introducing bonuses for those who are working and earning the least.

Last week a party of opposition MPs from Civic Platform’s parliamentary group travelled to Nidzica to try to appeal to voters.

But within days — in a sign of the difficulty in expanding the party’s appeal — Civic Platform admitted it had failed to strike a broader electoral alliance with leftwing parties, as well as with the agrarian PSL, which has been losing supporters in the countryside to Law and Justice.

The parties said would fight separate campaigns, making it more unlikely that they will be able to unseat the governing party led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

PSL’s leader, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, said the failure of negotiations “was not about the seats in the parliament. It was about values, traditions and voters”.

Large state-owned farms dominated the economy of Masuria before the fall of communism. Unemployment has fallen sharply from 2014, when one in five in the region were jobless. But divisions persists: the average after-tax salary in the Masurian region amounted to around 2,800 zlotys, or €650, and was 30 per cent lower than the average salary in Warsaw.

Since Poland’s 2004 EU accession, many of Nidzica’s young people have moved to bigger cities or abroad in search for jobs. “In the last three years we managed to stop the drain. But we lost many inhabitants and it is hard to catch up,” said Nidzica’s mayor.

Mariusz, who works in Sweden as a welder and just got back home for the holidays, does not see any future for himself in Nidzica. “I worked in a furniture factory here, but I did not earn well, so when I got an opportunity through a friend, I moved to Sweden straight away,” he said.

If the opposition did not come up with a new, attractive manifesto, especially for young people, their outlook for the next election was bleak, said Mr Kosmala.


Opposition politicians are trying to appeal to small-town voters with a promise of less bureaucracy and a more entrepreneurial-friendly approach, emphasising intensified state controls and new bureaucratic obligations imposed by Law and Justice on small businesses and organisations.

Mr Kosmala said people complained about the intrusiveness of state institutions. “Businessmen complain about frequent fiscal controls, factory owners about health inspections, and ordinary people about the functioning of the judiciary.”

Barbara Nowacka, a prominent leftwing politican and one of those who visited the region last week, told activists: “The philosophy of the current government [is that] everybody is a suspect. We will change this approach. We want to help you, not fine you.”

But it remains to be seen whether this is enough to win the support in Nidzica. Asked about his predictions for the parliamentary elections, Mr Kosmala is sceptical: “In our region, 48 per cent of inhabitants are working, and 52 per cent are not. Those that don’t work benefited a lot from Law and Justice policies. You do the maths.”",Polihs grasshooper citizen,/r/europe/comments/cga76r/polands_opposition_struggles_for_traction_in/eufmx5j/,SlyScorpion,1563781389

1143,"We have the same in the Netherlands. It is a scandinavian legal tradition/organisation of the state. It is meant to keep legislative, executive and judicial powers separated.

So our constitution says that the judicial may not judge whether a law is in conformity with the constitution.

We got around the problems this might pose, because the judges are able to test laws against international law. Since we are part of international treaties that protect rule of law and human rights, courts can strike down laws for not being compliant with for example the ECHR.

Also, there is preventive testing, when a law is being made by the judiciary. The reason is that our law making culture is much more consensus based. It takes into account different parties and the opinion of the courts. The swedish Ombudsman is a concept with similar consensus based aims.

Now I am not saying the system is perfect. Like I said, we found a hack around it and maybe Finland should too. However, the parliamentary culture and all the systems build around it should be taken into account when judging a particular part of the legal system. 

This scandinavian system has worked rather well for these countries. I think you will find the scandinavian countries and the netherlands score rather well in rule of law rankings.

That doesn’t mean it can’t be improved and there definitely should be a failsafe. Sweden introduced it in 1980, the Netherlands reviews based on international treaties.

Yes and no. This one goes to 1918 and how it was formed and was was expected from it by two biggest nations, Croats and Serbs. 

Basically, Serbs fought against Turks and were independent for some time and saw Yugoslavia as a way of unification of all Serbian lands (which were described pretty generously), while Croats just left Austro-Hungary and were looking for more participation and equal rights. 

On the first day of the new country there were protests in Zagreb against it and several people were killed.

1216,"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Londons-public-transport-so-expensive

&gt; Why is London's public transport so expensive?
&gt;
&gt; Public subsidies.
&gt;
&gt;London Underground is one of the few city transport systems anywhere in the world, where operating costs are entirely covered by fares. By contrast, only 30% Paris Metro’s costs are covered revenues from fares.
&gt;
&gt;This is reflected in the cost of season tickets. A monthly zones 1–6 London travelcard is £231.20. The equivalent in Paris is €65.20.
&gt;
&gt;UK governments have established record of operating public transport on a commercial rather public basis. Outside London, most UK buses are operated by private operators for profit. British Rail received some lowest annual subsidies in Europe. In recent years, governments have chosen to increase regulated rail fares above inflation in efforts to reduce public subsidies.
&gt;
&gt;London buses remain one of the few examples of a non-commercial public service. Adult fares are fixed at £1.50 per journey with a second journey free, if made within the hour. A one day London bus pass is £4.50 and is cheaper than equivalent buses passes sold by commercial operators elsewhere in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

As the [Defence24.pl](https://Defence24.pl) portal has learned, the completion of the development of the Advanced Individual Fight System (ZISW) Titan should take place at the end of the first quarter of next year. **Thus, there is a chance to start deliveries of the first of 14 000 systems.**

&amp;#x200B;

The contract for the implementation of the research and development phase of ZISW Tytan was signed in the office building of the PCO S.A. factory. five years ago - June 27, 2014. This ended the two-year negotiations with the domestic industry and research centers. Ultimately, the ZISW Tytan consortium included the following entities: PCO S.A. as the leader, Polski Defense Holding, Bumar Elektronika, Fabryka Broni Łucznik, Przedsiębiorstwo Sprzętu ochronnego Maskpol, WB Electronics, Military University of Technology, MESKO, DEZAMET Metal Works, Military Institute of Aviation Medicine, Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, RADMOR (today part of the WB Group) ), Zakłady Mechaniczne Tarnów.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, a contract was signed to supply 14,000 complete ""soldier of the future"" systems. It was assumed then that the first sets will be delivered in 2018 after development works carried out in 2014-2017. System tests were to be carried out by soldiers from the 17th Mechanized Brigade using the Rosomak KTO. The last Titans were to be received by the Polish Armed Forces in 2022. The framework contract provided for the investment and purchase of sets in total PLN 5 billion, and in 2014 alone, PLN 300 million was allocated to R &amp; D works from R &amp; D, and additional 100 million

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On March 9, 2016, and the Chief of the Armament Inspectorate approved the Preliminary Design Assessment and verified Tactical and Technical Assumptions. On November 8 of the same year, another annex was included, taking into account the preliminary design assessment, as well as verified tactical and technical assumptions being the result of technological progress in the world.

""During the development work of ZISW TYTAN, the requirements for the system itself as well as its elements, including personal radio, were corrected, which resulted from the technological progress and the requirements of the Ministry of National Defense. The prototypes currently being developed are carried out in accordance with the new criteria, ""the Armament Inspectorate said.

The idea was to create a system serving the armed forces in the perspective of many years, and not which at the time of introduction will be anachronistic. In recent times, when looking at projects implemented for the benefit of the US Army, for example, the openness of architecture has begun, and thus the possibility of integrating the system with solutions that may appear in the future.

For these reasons, the deadline for the delivery of the first serial Titans has been postponed. Last summer, IU informed in the communiqué that the first deliveries of complete ZISW Tytan are planned ""no sooner than in 2020"", after the positive completion of development work. In the same communication, it was reported that the qualifying tests of four of the 27 planned elements had already ended with a positive result. It was a 9 mm self-loading pistol, 5.56 mm standard rifle (MSBS), a 40 mm grenade launcher and a knife-bayonet, thus an armament subsystem requiring no electronic integration with ZISW. The effect of completing work on MSBS was also the introduction of the Grot rifle to the Territorial Defense Forces, where it is being refined on the basis of field experiments.

&amp;#x200B;

In the summer of 2018, it was also informed that preliminary tests are in progress: 1100 BC4I battery, anti-armour cartridge with tungsten core 5.56x45 mm, helmet display, laser pointer, shooting sight, universal monocular, personal flashlight, collimator sight, integrator, inertial navigation and camouflage. In terms of the other components as well as the complete integrated system, the Agreements of the Preliminary Research Methods and Methods lasted.

&amp;#x200B;

""For the Advanced Individual Fight System (ZISW) Titan, prototypes of all elements of development work were made. Currently, preliminary system tests are underway ""- reported today the Armament Inspectorate in response to the questions of Defense24.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, qualifying tests of individual components of the system and then of Titan as an integrated whole are to take place. As reported by the representative of the Armament Inspectorate: ""**the end of the development work of ZISW Titan is expected at the end of March 2020.""**

&amp;#x200B;

This information is important for many reasons. Firstly because, for the first time in the history of the program, we are not dealing with postponing the completion of the program in the distant future. There are talks about the end of ZISW counted in months. This means that the individual components are actually ready and their tests end with positive results. The completion of development works in March 2020, and therefore at the beginning of the year, also really gives the opportunity to start deliveries in 2020. This meant that the project is proceeding in accordance with the redefinition plan, although it is lagging behind earlier assumptions.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, after testing individual elements, there may be a problem of integrating elements into subsystems and then into one whole. Such potential complications as electromagnetic compatibility or the demand for electricity and the possibility of its provision by the battery are at stake. However, these issues were taken into account already in 2014 and earlier during the negotiation phase. The current schedule is therefore likely to be maintained.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/cg8gsd/polish_future_soldier_titan_ready_in_spring_2020/eufc8w1/,Tartyron,1563769095

The Belovezha Accords that terminated the relationship between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have proven to be a mistake contrary to the wishes of the majority of the population in 1991. 

There is nothing extraordinary about Ukraine that binds the people living on its territory. Ukraine has no founding fathers, important historical battles, or common language. The difference with Russia is stark, as Russia is a country with significant levels of patriotism, historical watersheds e.g. 1380, 1812, 1917.

It's rather curious that some comments are vociferously opposed to unity and integration between Russia and its neighbors such as common currency, economic convergence, shared foreign policy, and the prominence of the foreign language. The same folks who favor disunity between Russia and its neighbors are loud cheerleaders of projects such as the European Union with its law-making bodies, regulations, courts, currency, etc, even though Russia  and Ukraine literally have a shared history and a common language while there's very little that binds all members of the European Union.

Mind you that I'm not saying ""people should be forced to work together with authoritarian methods"", that's not it at all, I just really like the ideal of cooperation over competition.

All was good in the hood if you were down with the party, but dissidence was punished severely, from being imprisoned at Goli Otok to disappearing into the night.

1313,"&gt;The whole fucking point of a judicial power and a police is that you don't deliver justice yourself.

I don't think you understood the problem at all - and overestimate the effect of the police and the juridical apparatus on such people. Your argument leads to an unpleasant conclusion - people should rather not defend themselves but leave punishment to the state. This is unpleasant for two reasons. The first one: The juridical system doesn't work with such people. The threat of getting another sentence on parole is not a threat for them, [this issue is also showing up in the criminal statistics](https://www.nachrichten.at/oberoesterreich/straffaellige-afghanen-anstieg-bei-sexualdelikten;art4,3113323). The second one: People will suffer from not defending themselves, some may die of it. 

The right to self defence becomes useless, when it is tied to the perpetrator not getting a scratch - that guy in this case didn't even get any serious injuries. Someone, who is subjected to physical violence should be able to shut the threat down without having to worry if his counterpart gets a scratch or his hairstyle ruined. Making people reluctant to use self defence enables criminals who count on their victims not defending themselfes.

1314,"That's even worse than Polish haha. In the Polish language, we have a lot of varieties of verbs. For nouns, it's not as much though. For example, the word ""dog"" is ""zamek"" and you can say it normally, change it based on declension (or something else, it depends), or change the word into a different one with the same meaning (we have a lot of synonyms for our words). For example, words like ""warownia"", ""twierdza"", or ""forteca"". They have a bit different meaning, but overall you get almost the same picture. You can also change words by modifying its end, to turn them into an augmentative or diminutive one. For example, the word ""zamczysko"", it has the same meaning as ""zamek"", but different impact. I would say it has more of an aggressive tone (it's an augmentative word). Or you can say ""zameczek"", which has a nicer sound (it's a diminutive word). The thing is that you can use declension on those words too. So that's when it gets messy. You can check out it here (it's in Polish, but if you want it in English here's the link: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/zamek (it has way less info though)).",,/r/europe/comments/cfx5zt/english_vs_polish/euf454z/,GameDSS,1563762025

1423,"I think you are not fully correct. You can use Za and Na for uczyć się. It still has a meaning, but it is just not too usable. Zauczyć się could mean the same as Zaczytać się (to read something for a long time) but with learning instead of reading. It is just most common to say that someone was studying for long time instead of using one world. Also word Zauczyć can not be in any of dictionaries, but still a Polish guy will know what Zauczyć sie means, it is just not used and if you say that, it can just sound funny or odd. But still have ameaning.

If someone just danced, then he Zatańczył. But if someone just learned (not learned something, just ""learned"", the same way as ""danced"") then he Zauczył. But this is just not used and probably not in dictionary, but still polish people will get the meaning if word is used in correct circumstances.

You don't need to learn more that one word and the rules of word making. One world - jeść, and alot of suffixes, prefixes, rules and other thing that will transform that word instead of making while sentence. But that has been explained in other comments.

Case is even if polish is considered hard, it is easier to learn when you have similar rules of wordmaking like in Spanish or Czech or even German. Other things are just coming to you, it is just logical, Lego fun. And you don't bend that Legos, you just have smaller Lego pieces than in English and you use them also for making words also, not only sentences as in English. But that way you can say something with only one world and this still have a meaning as whole sentence. If you broke polish words to parts, and just put spaces, it is sometimes even easier to translate to English, just that prefixes and suffixes don't mean anything for their own. But wen used with words, they means the same. So even if those can't be considered a word, still makes the same job. And you don't need to learn too much of those.

Oh, let me guess. You want to decide yourself which elections are fraudulent, and which are not - depending on what suits you, right? Screw democratic institutions, you know better than anybody. You decided that for the last 20 years elections were fraudulent, but before then they weren't? Probably because it wasn't the guy you oppose was in power, am I right? Then the elections magically become valid? Or may be you're just a brainwashed victim of propaganda who is told to believe what he needs to believe? Hmmm...

Well, my young friend. World doesn't work like this. We have democratic institutions that say who can run for elections, and if you disagree - well that's too bad. We have democratic institutions to verify the elections, and your personal opinion and outrage counts just as much as mud under my fingernails.

[This picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock-face_scheduling#/media/File:Correspondance_of_trains_at_Geneva.jpg) demonstrates it quite easily: The train on the left will arrive at 15:29 (or a bit earlier, that's actually its departure time), and continue to Lancy-Port-Rouge. The train on the right will depart at 15:31 and go to Geneva-Airport.

Often they employ a [symmetry minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_minute), like 58½ - this is the point in time where trains going in opposing directions on the same route will cross. At the terminal points of a route, where trains turn around, the middle of the turn around time falls exactly on the symmetry minute. And at non-terminal stations, trains going in opposite directions will cross each other at the symmetry minute. If those symmetry times are kept the same on the entire network, it means that the connection times will be the same in both directions.",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/cfy8n8/average_speed_of_trains_in_europe_my_own_research/eueibr7/,PistachioCaramel,1563745094

Secondly, the words have suffixes which replace prepositions and postpositions. Just like in English you have to learn what ""in"", ""out"", ""into"", ""of"", ""with"", ""as"" and so on mean, you learn the meaning of suffixes in Finnish. Many of those forms of koira just repeat the same suffixes. 

It's comparable to English having ""*with my dog, with your dog, with his dog, with our dog, with your dog, with their dog, with my dog too, with your dog too, with his dog too, with our dog too, with your dog too, with their dog too*.

With those, you have to know the meaning of the prepositions and postpositions and their order. You cannot write *dog on my, with dog your, dog his into, our with dog* and so on. They don't have the same meaning. You have to learn the order and meaning of them. It's the same in Finnish, but with suffixes instead of prepositions and postpositions. 

Though Finnish does have prepositions and postposition, but unlike in English, their place isn't fixed. In English ""Sarah comes with John"" has a different meaning from ""John comes with Sarah"". But in Finnish ""Sarah tulee Johnin kanssa"" has the same meaning as ""tulee Johnin kanssa Sarah"", ""Sarah kanssa Johnin tulee"" and ""Kanssa Johnin Sarah tulee"".

I assume it's been effected by lobbyism from the beginning. I wouldn't be surprised if people being paid by the coal and automobile industry would have ""helped"" writing the initial proposal.

The [price of the EU ETS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme) is rather [low in comparison](https://www.carbontax.org/where-carbon-is-taxed/). Looks like a solution which is economically and politically feasible. Not what is scientifically necessary.

But I appreciate any of those systems. The hardest part is to install it. Once in place, it's rather easy to ramp it up to necessity.

What is necessary? 

1. Price for emission has to be higher than price for sequestration. Otherwise, there is a net incentive to increase atmospheric GHG, but we have to move in the opposite direction. AFAIK sequestration is between $100 and $200 per ton (please correct me with a source if I'm wrong)
2. Price for emission has to be higher when our remaining budget is lower. When [the budget nears depletion](http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/global_mitigation_curves.shtml), the price has to skyrocket.

The other part of the propaganda story is painting post-soviet Russia as something functional that was destroyed by evil-doers. That is not even close to the truth. Soviet economy had collapsed, oil price was low and the extremely corrupt country had a shiteconomy with lack of skills. Reforms were needed and they were going to be painful. Yeltsin's government didn't actually do too bad of a job considering what can be realistically expected in such situation.


The reason why Kremlin creates the propaganda stories are relevant. They are there to uplift Putin's reputation and tie things like brief freedoms Russia had in the 90s to the economic misery. Also painting Yeltsin as western puppet and economic hardship being caused by being friendly with the west, as you can already see Russian posters do in this thread, increases Kremlin's ability to get away with their shit and for the larger Russian psychological need to not face the reality.

Every summer Young Euro Classic Festival in Berlin brings together young musicians from all over the world. This year's jubilee edition of the festival will be inaugurated on 19 July by the Polish Sinfonia Iuventus Orchestra.

- Since the beginning of the festival, we have been focusing on Central and Eastern Europe time and again. Poland is one of our most important neighbours. 30 years ago, the Iron Curtain dividing Europe fell, in which Poland played a decisive role. By inviting Polish musicians to open the festival, we want to highlight its special, historical role,"" said DW szefowa and one of the founders of the festival Gabriele Minz.

The Polish Jerzy Semkow Sinfonia Iuventus Orchestra will play - at the organisers' request - Beethoven's symphonies, the Fifth and Sixth, and the Polish accent - Toccata for small orchestra by Artur Malawski, whose pupil was the initiator of Sinfonia Iuventus, Maestro Jerzy Semkow.

Presenting works by composers less known in the world, forgotten and rediscovered is a tradition of the festival. Just like the world premieres, for example the work ""Alcance-Reach"", written especially for the Berlin festival, by João Godinho, a composer from Lisbon, performed by Jovem Orquestra Portuguesa (JOP). ""Every performance is a declaration for us. If we believe that music is a universal language for social change, we want it to be perceived by listeners as such,"" explains conductor Pedro Carneiro.

**20 years for Europe**

This is the spirit in which the festival is maintained, as its organisers emphasize: ""The message expressed in the universal language of music for Europe, diversity and understanding, which at the very time of difficult times gives encouragement"".

Such a message is, for example, the Underground Youth Orchestra (UYO) from Athens, a private initiative created in the years of the Greek economic crisis. In the words of its artistic director Costas Eliades: ""In such a pessimistic, gloomy atmosphere, these young musicians embody hope for a new way of thinking that leads to change. UYO, together with the chamber orchestra of the Berlin University of Arts, will perform the Greek Zorba of the legendary composer Mikis Theodorakis in a new arrangement and under the direction of Christoph Eschenbach, conductor of the host orchestra Konzerthaus at the Gendarmenmarkt in Berlin.

he cultural diplomacy, exchange and construction of bridges is a stay at the Berlin National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain or not only a musical sensation - the first professional Israeli orchestra composed half of Israeli, half of Palestinian musicians: Galilee Chamber Orchestra.

- Young Euro Classic is planning its programme with the awareness of the current political situation,"" says Gabriele Minz. - We deliberately want to oppose trends, the festival is an expression of community and reconciliation from the very beginning,"" she explains.

Young Euro Classic has long since left the borders of Europe. The festival, created as a pro-European initiative, invites young orchestras from all over the world. Since its first edition in 2000, it has hosted 170 orchestras from 23.5 thousand musicians from over 70 countries. This year's jubilee, 20th edition will be attended by 19 orchestras with 1200 musicians, from China and the Republic of Tatarstan, to Chile and the Dominican Republic. The festival will end with a world premiere of the piece ""Delicate Tension"", inspired by the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, a young American composer Tyson J. Davis, performed by the National Youth Orchestra of the USA, also making its debut in Berlin.

**""This is where the future plays out.**

This year's festival will focus on Ludwig van Beethoven, a single composer. In accordance with its motto ""Here's where the future plays"", the Young Euro Classic jubilee celebrates a different jubilee - next year's 250th anniversary of the genius' birthday.

Nine of his symphonies and further works will be performed by eleven young orchestras from all over the world, and the Fifth and Sixth will be opened by the Jerzy Semkow Polish Sinfonia Iuventus Orchestra under the direction of a young, 33-year-old conductor Jakub Chrenowicz.

- The specificity of orchestras such as Sinfonia Iuventus lies in the fact that new people constantly come to them, and those who become mature musicians from young musicians go further into the world. It will be my second meeting with this orchestra, but it is difficult for me to say that it will be the same orchestra. The band is constantly rejuvenating itself, so I expect something new and different,"" said Maestro Chrenowicz in an interview with DW Maestro.

Sinfonia Iuventus hosts in Berlin for the third time, for the first time it inaugurates the musical festival of youth. It is a great honour for Jakub Chrenowicz. - It is a well-known, renowned festival and I am very pleased to have been invited to conduct the orchestra in a magnificent concert hall at the Gendarmenmarkt, in a city with a great position in the musical world and an excellent repertoire. I'm happy and I'm looking forward to it,"" he concluded.

1783,"FYI: Switzerland runs its trains intentionally (slightly) slower on some routes that they technically could. This is because the benefits of the harmonized [clock-face schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock-face_scheduling) are far greater than shaving off a few minutes of travel time.

So in major cities the trains will always leave every hour (in most every half hour) to other major destinations. Most of them 00/30, some 15/45, depending on distances. This makes it very easy to remember timetables and makes for very good connections when you need to change - you'll arrive in Zürich on the hour, and your train to Bern will leave on the hour. This strategy has and will be continuously expanded. So over time, more and more cities became so called ""full nodes"" where this is the case:

1848,"Yes, it's just a few notable examples and not the norm. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapaj%C3%B3s_hydroelectric_complex#Impact) is the biggest known offender, with estimated emissions (CO2 equivalent, due to methane emissions) that are comparable to fossil fuel power plants per kWh.

&gt; Along the years I've seen various estimates of carbon dioxyde [*equivalent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent) for the various manners of generating electricity : hydro was consistently at the bottom, so I feel confident that *small* hydro would sit there too. 

In case of run of river or small hydro I wouldn't worry about methane emissions at all, of course. There, just like with regular hydro, the CO2eq impact comes mostly from the construction. However, it's just my intuition that run of river hydro would require more material per energy generated than a large dam system, meaning I'd expect its CO2eq/kWh to be most likely higher. How higher, I have no idea. But I'd like to see some specific calculations like they've been done for the large dam systems. I don't think it would get anywhere close to fossil fuel emissions of course.

&gt;So all in all, what we're talking about here is something that is, and will remain, a footnote of a footnote. 

Sure, if it remains a footnote it's irrelevant, but if we're suggesting greatly expanding Europe's hydro capacity by expanding run of river hydro that'd make the numbers worth looking at. Again, I don't expect that big of a difference, but we can't just assume it's the same as existing hydro, and doing the numbers is necessary before it can be determined that it's a viable idea anyway.",,/r/europe/comments/cfn90q/switch_from_coal_to_gas_cut_co2_emissions_from/eudokft/,zolikk,1563723373

Yes I am passionate about the History of Alsace, as most of my family is from there. I get annoyed by revisionist anti-german comments denying any German history of Alsace just because they feel like they need to give its French claim more legitimacy. Like the one above.

No. Maybe it was wrong of me to use the past tense becaue it might be confusing, but jeść, jadłem, je, etc. all would be used when you describe a continuous process of eating. Zjeść, zjadłem, zje, etc. would be used to describe the fact that something has been eaten.

It's relevant all the time. But you don't really think about it when you're a native speaker. Might make some mistakes when drunk though. ;)

Indeed, and in the Chagos case, the population wasn't local as they were temporary workers. 

&gt; Cleansing means just cleansing people out of a region.

Cleansing implies violence and/or murder. Or should we say governments cleanse areas when they use compulsory purchase orders for new infrastructure? 

&gt; Country doesn't exist before then may be the clue there. And of course they do demand it since they have more rights than some colonial empire.

Not true, it was previously administered by the French and the Dutch. Of course, if we're divvying up countries by colonial regions, then Mauritius should annex the Seychelles too. 

&gt; I don't see any parallels with France really. 

France was administered as part of the Gallic region of the Roman Empire, which included Iberia in it. On the basis of colonial/imperial administration, this means that Iberia should be part of France. It's a ridiculous argument, but it's the exact same one you've been making. 

&gt; without the will or anything by the locals or the country in general. 

I think you'll find that both Cyprus and Cypriots are perfectly fine with British bases on their island, and are probably glad since they stopped the Turkish advance. 

&gt; EU law isn't something binds Iran

For heaven's sake. The ship had stopped in EU waters, therefore it was bound to EU law. The fact that it belonged to Iran is completely immaterial since it stopped in British waters/jurisdiction. Foreigners are required to obey the laws of the countries they visit, and ships are required to obey the laws of countries they dock in. *It was no longer in international waters since it stopped, and was therefore bound by British law!*

It doesn't matter if there were UN sanctions, or Iranian sanctions, or any other sanctions. There were EU sanctions, and the ship had stopped in EU waters. It no longer had the right of innocent passage. 

&gt; &gt;Stormed is a strong word.

&gt;That's what happened though. 

The Bastille was stormed. Armies storm. Police boarding a boat with no military doesn't really fit. 

&gt;Because it's just some arbitrary excuse that many others doesn't even finds that ""legal"". It was just something that was found as an excuse to seize the ship on the orders of the US. Why deny it still?

Only people online who don't understand how the law of the sea works deny the legality. Britain doesn't do anything on the orders of the US. I'm not denying the US wanted it (and never had despite your insistence that I have, if you're going to try and throw my words back at me then at least make them relevant), and may have alerted local authorities to it, but it was seized on the basis of breaking sanctions. The seizure was legal because it had stopped in British waters. It was breaking British/EU sanctions, and so therefore the seizure was warranted. Why aren't you accepting that it stopped?

2134,"Again, I think this situation mainly stems from the fact that they are not allowed to be who they are. I mean, if you bash me for being a Turk on a regular basis, then I'll aggressively show my ""Turkish side"" in order to get myself a place in the society. The ones who are not brave enough to do that face even worse consequences: they turn into lonely people rejected by society. Do I need to tell you about how bad it is to ostracize and target a group of people which can, in right conditions, become a healthy &amp; productive part of the society? 

To be honest with you, I've never seen a gay walk around with leather masks in daily life. Parades are a special event. Don't confuse it with how an average gay lives. Moreover, I understand your points and respect that. I am not gay and some parts of this stuff also sound too radical and extreme to me - everything has a limit. For example, I'm OK with gays but I strongly oppose the notion that children should be raised sexless. What the fuck? No, if they want to be ""sexless"" or ""a female in a male body"", then they should be allowed to do whatever they want once they've reached maturity - this is their business. But I will not make children a part of that, this is stupid.

However, just like everything, LGBT people also have some extremists among them so no big deal. I mean, you might be thinking that Christian values are what makes Poland a good place but a guy who is ""more"" Christian than you may believe that you need to be killed for being soft. Does that make Christianity bad? 

Moreover, in all honesty, I think LGBT people are much, much less dangerous than religions and all those rules we follow as tradition or culture. They just want to be left alone with their choices. That's it. They're not preaching to make us gay. 

In my opinion, people are so aggressively against this stuff mainly because they are scared. Just like this popular Ugandan interview where the guy asks a gay rights activist ""why should someone be gay"", most people get it wrong. LGBT or gay rights activism is **not about making the world gay**. It is about **protecting the honor and safety of people who are gay**. 

I'm sorry if this offends anyone but my view on this is quite simple: I am interested in ladies. I wanna have sex with them. A friend of mine, however, is interested in guys. He wanna fucks the shit out of them. That's it. So simple. Just different tastes, maybe. What makes me a ""normal"" guy while he is an enemy of the state and moral? Because he won't have kids? Umm, you can always adopt? Believe me, ""two fathers"" is always much better than a stupid, broken family. Moreover, I have no intentions of getting married and having children. So what, I'm the bad guy now? 

Gays can be traditional and even conservative. It's just a simple matter of having a different idea &amp; orientation. As long as we make a big deal out of such trivial things, well, gays will also show their gayness full force, which is justifiable.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/cfod1k/polish_cities_and_provinces_declare_lgbtfree/eud53e5/,Rigelmeister,1563701873

Poland has still long way to go but if you look 20 or even 10 years in the past you would see that this is HUGE increase of support, if I am not mistaken in 2002 support for registred partnership for same-sex couples was below 20%.

If you wonder why Poland is still so far behind west you need to realize that this is consequence of west leaving Poland on this side of iron curtain, as you should know soviets dont exactly like gay people, actually russia has still such views to this day, russian media are actually mocking/criticising growth of support for gay-marriages in Poland, acting like Poland is poisoned by ""western values""",,/r/europe/comments/cfqbbq/poland_pride_march_four_scum_gang_up_on_one/eud55vd/,Culaio,1563701982

2192,"&gt;Native and indigenous are synonyms. 

Not really. They're different terms, which might refer to some thing or not.

&gt;And the Falklands don't rely on water imports, so a little different. 

That doesn't change if a population is local or not. 

&gt;You missed a word I think. Cleansing does imply murder, hence why ethnic cleansing is looked down upon. The population was removed, but the population was composed of workers not settlers. 

It does not. Cleansing means just cleansing people out of a region.

The population were also locals already. They haven't left by their own will either but forced out. 

&gt;That's because the UN is absolute garbage. Mauritius claims the islands because they were administered in the same district, not because they it previously belonged to their country. France may as well claim Iberia because it was once part of as administrative region in Rome. 

Country doesn't exist before then may be the clue there. And of course they do demand it since they have more rights than some colonial empire.

I don't see any parallels with France really. 

&gt;Well, the former is your opinion, and the latter is nonsense. Britain hasn't forcibly moved anyone from their homes for the bases. What's more, following the Turkish invasion, the Base was quite happy to allow access for fleeing refugees, grant humanitarian aid, and allow new villages and refugee camps to be set up. 

They haven't moved out anyone. It's not what I'm saying. I'm saying, UK is trying to find an agreement where the villages left out of the base areas so that Cyprus can't claim anything again.

Just those bases are some utter nonsense that still exists, without the will or anything by the locals or the country in general. 

&gt;Would you like a hand moving that goalpost? The US may have wanted it, but it was EU law which allowed it, Britain wouldn't have done anything if there weren't sanctions in place. If it didn't want to be seized, it shouldn't have stopped in EU waters. 

EU law isn't something binds Iran. Anything is also used as an excuse. What mattered was US wanting it. Nothing less, nothing more.

EU won't be stopping a foreign ship off the coast for allegedly sending oil to a country that doesn't have any UN sanctions on either. 

&gt;Stormed is a strong word.

That's what happened though. 

&gt;And, again it's not an arbitrary excuse. The ship was stopped in British waters, therefore it falls under British jurisdiction and law. I don't know why you refuse to accept this. It stopped. It wasn't passing on. It was anchored for supplies and provisions. Why deny it?

Because it's just some arbitrary excuse that many others doesn't even finds that ""legal"". It was just something that was found as an excuse to seize the ship on the orders of the US.

2286,"&gt; Now, again, before ""RUSSIA DID IT""... Most fighters are locals. Like it or not: majority of people in Donbass feel threatened by Kyiv regime and want Russian support.

What exactly are they “threatened” by? Russian military forces entered the country and fermented the rebellion. What, are they reading American military forces are going to walk in and ferment a rebellion? Were the Ukrainians going to send them to gulags? 

The war in the Donbass is the result of hundreds of years of Russification and assaults on the Ukrainian nation. For a long time, Russians refused to even recognize Ukrainians as a distinct people, even going as far as calling their language a “dialect of Russian”. They considered Ukraine as a province of the Russian empire. The Soviets were even worse since Ukrainian nationalism was far more popular in Ukraine than their unpopular Russian Bolshevism. This caused them to be even more paranoid of them, with Stalin intentionally starving the country in order to cripple any semblance of resistance. All the Ukrainian nationalists were deemed Nazis and any mention of Soviet atrocities was deemed Nazi Propaganda. Victims who escaped and tried to document it were all deemed Neo Nazis. Meanwhile all the homes abandoned by those who either starved to death or fled to the cities to find food were replaced with new Russian arrivals. Up until the 80’s Ukraine seemed to have been successfully killed as a distinct nation. There is good reason why Ukrainians fear Russia. 

Of course, now that Ukraine has had a national reawakening, all that long history has come to a flashpoint. Descendants of Russian settlers who grew up with the above propaganda feel differently about Ukrainian independence. Russians in Russia who refuse to come to terms with their legacy double down on the old Soviet and Russian propaganda, even deeming the Holodomor as Nazi Propaganda.",,/r/europe/comments/cfj5rj/iconic_photo_from_eastern_ukraine/eucu6vf/,DangerousCyclone,1563686975

&gt;Libertarian Party halts new law aimed at restricting ballot access
&gt;
&gt;The Libertarian Party of Arkansas is claiming an “important victory” in its challenge of 2019 state laws aimed at making it harder for political parties to qualify for the ballot.
&gt;
&gt;Federal Judge Kristine Baker issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday against the law that raised the petition requirement for a party to qualify for the ballot from 10,000 signatures to 3 percent of the votes cast in the last governor’s race (26,746).
&gt;
&gt;The Republican-dominated legislature passed several laws to make ballot access harder. The particular target was the Libertarian Party because it’s seen as a threat to lure Republican voters.

So while I can easily *believe* that Moscow may well be trying to game the elections, I'd could also believe that the invalidations are legitimate, and I'd also point out that a regrettable number of political institutions out there outside Russia do try to jack up the threshold to get on the ballot.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cfr8r6/thousands_demand_fair_elections_in_moscow/eucvpu2/,vokegaf,1563688705

2370,"&gt; Iran hasn't attempted to build a nuclear weapon yet.

Wrong. In 2005, Iran was building a uranium-enrichment facility for a nuclear weapons program. It was destroyed by western powers.

&gt; They are the most logical Ally of the west in the middle east and the only Nation there with a functional state, decent levels of education and a manufacturing base. 

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, and Egypt are all better alternatives. Not only do they have all those things, but they also aren’t funding Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah, killing allied soldiers in the middle east, threatening the destruction of Israel, taking over embassies by force and holding foreign diplomats hostage, and engaging in piracy on the open seas.

&gt; Just a relentless hostility from the West which toppled an elected government there brings out the most defensive and reactionary part.

Yes. When you take over western embassies by force and hold the foreign diplomatic staff hostage, burn our flags, shout in your national assembly, “Death to America!”, arm insurgents and jihadists with specialized bombs to kill western soldiers in a foreign country, attempt to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in violation of UN policy, bomb US barracks and kill hundreds of Marines in Lebanon, shoot down American military assets in international airspace, attack multiple international oil tankers with limpet mines, take over a British tanker and hold the crew hostage in an act of piracy, then you will get hostility from the west.

2379,"No you're not because I'm not claiming what you think I'm claiming. 

The pressure I talk about means that the societies lack context for what is homosexuality. The population that only understood ancient stereotypes and knew images of, what they understood, hedonistic gay street orgies, without seeing homosexuals in any positive light in media or actually knowing openly gay people will not understand the need for equality. 

This context did not happen, things happened very quickly, from medieval view of homosexuality straight to calls for and considerations of civil unions and gay marriages. Someone mentioned a culture shock, that is partially appopriate term, but it is a shock in any case and it helped confused and ignorant people to rally with those who used the gay rights issue as means of gaining political power. 

There is also political pressure from EU and western societies and people don't understand why, again, because they don't understand the context of the need for things the country is pressured to do because the, again, empathy with homosexuals didn't yet penetrate into the minds of most people because, again, they don't know anything about homosexuals because, again, things happened suddenly and very quickly.

And now after I wrote this, you want to read it as ""so we shouldn't even try"" or ""let's just wait for a couple of decades and it will happen by itself"". That is not my point.

2391,"\&gt; By keeping that knowledge exclusive to church institutions, abusing this position of power to enact [literal censorship](http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/liste.html?art_id=475&amp;tid=415)? 

&amp;#x200B;

This is about the \*Middle Ages\* dude. The 1500s are not the Middle Ages. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; If it wasn't for Gutenberg the churches would probably still hold vast amounts of knowledge and ability hostage, to hide it away from the ""unworthy dirty masses"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The Church did not do that, at all. The Church was instrumental in improving agriculture and disseminating general knowledge. Monks meticulously copied tens of thousands of books so that they would not be lost to time. The vast majority of our knowledge from the classical world came through the Church, the Latin and the Byzantine Greek. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Yes, we all remember those ""civilized"" [crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland_massacres) and [inquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition), good thing those things happened or we would have done much worse? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember saying that the Church was incapable of doing bad things. It doesn't challenge my argument at all. The Church had a central role in the construction of the state and the promulgation of knowledge in the middle ages. It was a stabilizing institution at a time of great instability. 

I do think it's funny that you mention the Rhineland massacres, because the established Church was horrified by them, and the local clergy tried to stop them. It's kind of amusing that you mention the crusades and then pick exactly what the established Church liked the least about them, that is the unleashing of popular wrath. The Church \*feared\* the ""popular movement"" aspect of the First Crusade, and the role of people such as Peter the Hermit. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  but still does not negate centuries of very nasty history and the fact that churches were vehemently opposed to a change in status-quo as that meant losing a lot of power and influence, something nobody wants to lose. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not a particularly nasty history, no. And like you said, no on wants to lose power and influence, so that's hardly an interesting criticism of a historical actor. Reality and history is complex, it's not just heroes and villains. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  In that context, it's you who got it all twisted when you paint this narrative of churches helping in the secularization of Europe. 

I said the Church was instrumental in the civilizing of Europe during the Middle Ages. You \*could\* say that they were indirectly responsible for the later secularization as well, an argument Nietzsche in fact made. But that's not what I said, and that's not as certain as the fact that the Church stabilized and civilized Europe. You repeated the myth that the church was synonymous with the dark ages. You are wrong, as any proper student of medieval history would tell you. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  If churches had their way we'd all be still living under feudal rule and the only people with a say would be aristocracy and clerics, just liked it used to be before they were **forced** to give in. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Church ceased being ""The Church"" after the reformation and became a lot more fragmented and therefore complex. It's ignorant to claim knowledge of what ALL churches would want or do.

But the finer details of human prehistory, including the fate of groups that dispersed but apparently died out, have gotten more complicated with each new discovery.

There was not a single, linear evolution of humans - which was the presumption among paleoanthropologists just half a century ago - but rather many hominid species that coexisted for millions of years before a single species replaced everyone else.

""We're the last biped standing of what used to be a very, very diverse evolutionary tree,"" Potts said.

2429,"&gt;i had a legit concern about homophobic Poles, and you brush it off, dont even address it, and then make some odd comment about me being thrown off of a building in my country.

I brush it off because its overblown. There were multiple pride parades in Poland in recent time, nothing comparable happen on either of them yet you are pretty much calling every Pole a Homophobe because it happend on one parade, dont you consider this silly?

Throwing gays from a rooftop by muslims is a ""meme"", i generally use it in a case when someone vastly overreact what could happen to him. No, no homophobic Pole will go to Amsterdam just to smash your head in, the sheer fact that you are even worried about it is silly at best. Polish homophobe is no different than any other homophobe from wester europe.

&gt;what is that supposed to mean? are you gleeful at the prospect of me dying?

No idea why would you even think this way. Already explained what i ment by throwing from rooftops.

&gt;and you are proving the point of my original comment, about how Poles brush this shameful situation under the rug, your entire comment history proves that, you deflect and obfuscate all concerns, and make it seem like its not a big deal while gays in Poland are being attacked by homophobes.

Thats exactly why its hard to have a discussion with people like you. 
I hate when someone try to use emotions instead of facts so lets get over them:

1. There were multiple pride parades in recent time in Poland, no bigger incidents were reported (there were also a lot more parades than in the past).

2. Attacks on homosexuals are overall very rare, that doesnt mean they dont happen at all.

3. Attacks on homosexuals also happens in wester europe, lets stop pretending that this isnt the case.

Yes i think that lgbt situation in Poland is overblown, while not saying that there are no room for improvments but what you are insulting all Poles based on action of few, while forgeting that there were heterosexual Poles in those Parades as well.

&gt;while YOUR government is currently running a hateful and backwards, homophobic campaign against its LGBT community, but all you do and say is ''its not a big deal''

Its not my government and i agree that pis is being obnoxious about lgbt issues but it was only small part of Poland and it doesnt seems to create any more homophobic people based on recent polls about same sex marriage acceptance. I wish pis stopped acting like idiots but their actions dont necessery represent Polish society.

&gt;EU funds are a better deal for your country than mine. and no, the EU wont die because a 3rd tier country thats a social joke gets cut off from free money. Poland isnt France, Germany or the UK. its a larger slavic Portugal.

Your bigotry aside:

a) Cheap workforce, which western europe need (even Poland need it now)

b) Access to Polish market. Western companies bought Polish companies for cheap because of that, they also build their factories in Poland for cheap because of that.

c) Profit for increased exports

d) Buffer zone against Russia (you could put that one under NATO but still).

e) Its not free money, i laugh everytime someone see it this way, its like you have no understanding of economy at all, not to mention its like 1% of Polands gdp. Also saying that Poalnd isnt positive benefit for EU is a joke, educate yourself about the subject.

f) If EU funds were used as political tools it would be over for EU, at least in this current version. Not because Poland ""stronk"" but because it would increase tension between countries (not to mention it would be quite authoritarian). Also, i am pretty sure that this would end up with France and Germany as an union at most, they might add benelux but this wouldnt be needed. UK already had enough, you would want to bully rest of europe until almost noone left? It wouldnt be only Poland or Hungary, Italy would follow, Greece probably, not to mention that you consider most of Europe inferior so you will always find someone to whine about, how not ""progressive"" they are.

&gt;yes it is.

Doesnt really transfer to nation given how lgbt acceptance rise every year (you can check that on wiki), wiosna gets into European Parliament (which is led by a gay) and crimes against lgbt people are rare.

Government is a problem, not the people.

&gt;this is endorsed, and advocated by the current government. chosen by the people, represents the people.

by 18% of Polish people and lgbt issues werent important for making that decision.

&gt;keep making snide immature comments that disregards actual concerns about your country, and harp on about someone that is lgbt dying from being thrown off of a building on a thread that is about Poles whom are supported by the government beating lgbt people.

once more, you are proving my point. you have no argument other than a shit, disgusting comment.

No one is supporting beating lgbt people in Poland, get out from your own ass, seriously. Your lack of understanding of the issue is staggering not to mention that for someone so outraged about lgbt issues not to know about muslims throwing gays from rooftops is just funny. Honestly keep that fake outrage to yourself.

The only thing i am proving is your lack of knownledge and how much of a bigot you are. Insane how disrespectful you are while preaching about tolerance, gross. I also find it funny that you didnt even try to reaserch LGBT in Poland while you talk about arguments, amazing.

&gt;Butter knife 'an offensive weapon'
&gt;
&gt;By Duncan Gardham
&gt;
&gt;12:01AM BST 14 Apr 2005
&gt;
&gt;A butter knife can be an offensive weapon, the High Court ruled yesterday.
&gt;
&gt;The decision came in the rejection of an appeal by Charlie Brooker, of Welling, Kent, who had been convicted under the Criminal Justice Act of carrying a bladed instrument.
&gt;
&gt;Mark Hardie, appearing for Brooker, argued that the knife had no handle, sharp edges or points and therefore could not fall foul of a law intended to protect people from dangerous weapons.
&gt;
&gt;But Lord Justice Laws, sitting with Mr Justice David Steel, disagreed. He said: ""I would accept that a sharp or pointed blade was the paradigm case - however the words of the statute are unqualified and refer to any article that has a blade.""

Now, okay, technically I'm not sure whether he was actually arrested for the butter knife or whether he was arrested for something else and then just charged and convicted over having the butter knife as well.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cfl336/neonazi_daniel_ward_who_called_for_race_war_jailed/eucp2za/,vokegaf,1563681797

Ironically, taking christian boys as slaves to serve in the army originated from the fact that the Sultan could not trust the Turks in his army anymore. For example, a Turk in the Ottoman empire would never be trusted with government work or trade. These belonged to trusted other minorities.

Nobody was demanding a partition before 1974, and after 1960.

Although it wasn't Brits forced those. Sowwy. It is also still the legal framework of RoC. Unless you're claiming that since '63, or '67, '74, etc. RoC is no more, I don't see any logic in here. 

&gt;What weird non-sources? I already told that I was talking about your demands during the last negotiations. Do you want me to give you a link with the demands of the turkish side?

Ok, listen up, westerners.

People in Russia are very poor. I would dare say extremely poor. And up to 70% of the economy is directly or indirectly controlled by the government according to federal antimonopoly agency. The government is using firing as a deterrence measure, if you protest, you're loosing your job eventually, which is not cool when you have a family and literally no savings.

Government uses other measures of deterrence as well, many people were imprisoned, and Russian prisons are [hell on earth where you don't want to find yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6QYXvbkkws), not to mention its stigmatizing effect. So again, you are doomed to tortures and then to poverty and miserable life.

People are simply very scared, especially the elders, who have no savings, working for government and grew up in totalitarian soviet reality/post-soviet chaos. The biggest protest ever in the recent Russian history got 150000 at its peak [1].

So 20000 is quite a lot for Russia. Keep the context in mind. There are huge difference between the protests in liberal Europe and Putin's Russia.

2835,"Franky Zapata, aka Flyman: ""The Channel crossing is not a foregone conclusion"" 

*On his Flyboard, Franky Zapata is attempting a delicate Channel crossing on Thursday. But after his brilliant move at the July 14th fashion show, Flyman confided to us that he had ""a pressure coefficient of 10"".*  

By Vincent Mongaillard
July 20, 2019 at 6:40 pm, modified July 20, 2019 at 6:57 pm

Passengers on ferries connecting the two banks of the ""channel"" could, by looking up on the outer deck, see a strange bird in the distance... biped! No hallucinations on the horizon but the high-flying peregrinations orchestrated by Franky Zapata, 40 years old, star of the July 14 military parade, at the controls of a ""flyboard air"" straight out of his overflowing imagination. On July 25, 110 years after Louis Blériot's heroic epic, the Provençal in turn intends to invite himself into the history of aeronautics by becoming the first man to defeat the Channel with a flying board.

Standing on a kind of kerosene powered drone like airplanes, propelled by 5 engines and controlled by body movements and a joystick accelerator in hand controlling the thrust, it aims to split the air at a speed between 100 and 140 km/h. If all goes well, it will take him about 20 minutes to make the trip from Sangatte to Saint Margaret's Bay in Dover.

""It's really the result of a dream,"" he says. The former finalist of the TV show ""France has an incredible talent"" has ants in his legs but also admits that he is ""very stressed"".
""It's not at all a foregone conclusion.""

""With all the media following me now, I have the pressure coefficient 10,"" he says. Compared to what he is about to endure, his July 14 performance was a walk in the park. ""It was easy, a little ride and I came back! I used 3% of the machine's capacity while for the Channel, I will need 99.9%. It's not at all a foregone conclusion, I have a 30% chance of getting there,"" says the man who uses kerosene in his 35 kg backpack to fuel his car.

VIDEO. July 14: in the eyes of the man flying on his Flyboard Air

The former world champion in jet skiing has obtained the approval of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to take a little height at sea. For the airplane, everything is in order. But it's another pair of English Channel for the maritime part. Because to meet his crazy challenge, ""Flyman"" needs to refuel along the way by refuelling from a ship, its platform having an autonomy of only about ten minutes.
""The refusal of the prefecture multiplies by ten the difficulty""

However, he did not obtain the authorization of the maritime prefecture, which issued an ""unfavourable opinion"" at his request. The latter considers the area ""extremely dangerous"" due to the very heavy traffic in the Strait and fears a collision with container ships. As a result, instead of the two stops initially scheduled in French and then English waters, the ace of the wheel decided to make only one in English territory, thus positioning his boat halfway through its course. ""The refusal of the maritime prefecture multiplies by ten the difficulty of the challenge. This decision is completely arbitrary, unfounded. There are about ten windows where there are no boats,"" he says indignantly.

It will also adapt to the authorities' instructions, flying 70 m from the waves on the French side and 10 m almost ""flush with the water"" on the English side. The time of takeoff is not known at this time. Everything will depend on weather conditions and maritime traffic. ""We stand ready, from 6 a.m. to nightfall,"" he enthuses. The precise location of the takeoff is kept secret to avoid crowding. ""If we announced the place, it would become an air show and we would need more permits,"" he says.
Two more options for refuelling

For offshore refuelling, two technical options are available to Franky Zapata, who has not yet decided. The first solution is to fill the backpack with kerosene during a hover flight 3 m from the boat. The crew then handed him, thanks to a pole, a hose that allowed him to fill up in about a minute.

... this is literally what I just said. The threat is reduced business in the US, but you can do business with Huawei. What do you think the threat is?

&gt;Do you recall China threatening Europe to stop doing business with American companies?

Do you live under a rock? SK companies including Lotte were sanctioned for doing business with US regarding THAAD, certain companies are sanctioned for doing arms business with Tawain. Norway had their imports reduced regarding a fucking Nobel prize (not sanctions btw). France ran into some issues with the Olympics a while back

And if we're including 'threats' then I'm going to need more storage space on my SSD. They've been largely unrelated to US businesses up to this point since the money's been flowing but that's going to increase coming up. Dailai Lama, Taiwain-related and SCS-related threats alone would stack up to the moon. *The CCP urges [insert country] not to damage ties anymore*

[Here's a dated primer on how they continue to fly under the radar by being the state version of r/maliciouscompliance but not sanctions btw].(https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/ethics_online/0082)

&gt;Weird flex but okay? 

Not a flex. There's some memory loss when it comes to how USA was spying on German citizens e.g. Germany was doing the spying and handing over the data on their own. BND works very closely with our intelligence agencies

&gt;If Five Eyes don't care, why the threats against working with Huawei?

Reduced Chinese influence and not funding Chinese intelligence ambitions and apparatuses

&gt;Europe didn't choose Huawei yet. Europe simply refuses to bow down to American threats to exclude Huawei from even having a chance of being selected. And the harder the US push this despite offering ZERO evidence that Huawei is a ""national security threat"", the more Europe will stand its ground and refuse to side with Trump's crusade against a Chinese company.

2885,"&gt;yeah right. totally not biased and speaks on behalf of his entire people.

Lol, I know what my people want for sure. It's not about what I think, but I'm referring to what my community wants and thinks. Unlike out of blue assumptions and the general ignorance on Cyprus and Turkish Cypriots that folks from Turkey have. 

Also, if you're for going personal, giving my grandfather was one of the first TMT members that got trained in mid '50s, and I'm surrounded by ones who would be regarded as the more 'nationalist' kind due to that, I think I do know what I'm talking about. 

&gt;Show me polls though

2015 UN report had their own poll showing ~70% of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots high level of desire for peace process to produce results, and ~20% of Greek Cypriots and ~15% of Turkish Cypriots being ambivalent.

There was a more recent poll by the World Bank, showing two thirds of Greek Cypriots and three fourths of Turkish Cypriots desire a solution aka reunification by a common agreement.

Previous ones, both the pre-Annan and post-Annan ones shouldn't be hard to find either.  

Now please show me your own sources when claiming what we want. Hürriyet, Star or some weird Turkish mindset? Mate, really, just because you assume stuff or get ill-informed doesn't mean something is different than it is.

&gt; Turks of Cyprus want reunification though yes as 2004 showed. Greeks don't.

Turks of Cyprus is a weird term. You mean Turkish Cypriots I suppose? Because we are not continuum of some national group lives in Cyprus, but a community of Cypriots and Cyprus. Greek Cypriots hadn't wanted the conditions came with the Annan Plan. That doesn't mean they didn't and don't want a reunification. Our differences in the desired solution are obvious, while thinking or declaring it as some will to be divided up into two is just nonsense. You are better than claiming such a silly thing, come on.

It's funny how vast majority of Turkey wants my country to be divided, even against our own will.

Who are Turks. Unless you are Armenian or Greek-speaking.

&gt;Greek Cypriots hadn't wanted the conditions came with the Annan Plan. That doesn't mean they didn't and don't want a reunification

Yes. Reunification as in **retaking** N.C back. As mentioned before, they see your country as a lost land annexed by Turkey.

&gt;while thinking or declaring it as some will to be divided up into two is just nonsense

What is non sense is that believing in fairy tales like smooth reunification. Greeks just want to exert their influence on the whole island. Which is a no from us.

&gt;It's funny how vast majority of Turkey wants my country to be divided

Nah. Retaking Southern Cyprus would do a lot of harm. Can't do that.

3074,"How nice of you to dismiss the specific documented promises made to Gorbachev and confirmed by the government documents with a bunch of irrelevant quotes. 

Some more for you from the Georgetown National Security Archive

*The first concrete assurances by Western leaders on NATO began on January 31, 1990, when West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher opened the bidding with a major public speech at Tutzing, in Bavaria, on German unification. The U.S. Embassy in Bonn (see Document 1) informed Washington that Genscher made clear “that the changes in Eastern Europe and the German unification process must not lead to an ‘impairment of Soviet security interests.’ Therefore, NATO should rule out an ‘expansion of its territory towards the east, i.e. moving it closer to the Soviet borders.’” The Bonn cable also noted Genscher’s proposal to leave the East German territory out of NATO military structures even in a unified Germany in NATO.*

*Not once, but three times, Baker tried out the “not one inch eastward” formula with Gorbachev in the February 9, 1990, meeting. He agreed with Gorbachev’s statement in response to the assurances that “NATO expansion is unacceptable.” Baker assured Gorbachev that “neither the President nor I intend to extract any unilateral advantages from the processes that are taking place,” and that the Americans understood that “not only for the Soviet Union but for other European countries as well it is important to have guarantees that if the United States keeps its presence in Germany within the framework of NATO, not an inch of NATO’s present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction.” (See Document 6)*

*All the Western foreign ministers were on board with Genscher, Kohl, and Baker. Next came the British foreign minister, Douglas Hurd, on April 11, 1990. At this point, the East Germans had voted overwhelmingly for the deutschmark and for rapid unification, in the March 18 elections in which Kohl had surprised almost all observers with a real victory. Kohl’s analyses (first explained to Bush on December 3, 1989) that the GDR’s collapse would open all possibilities, that he had to run to get to the head of the train, that he needed U.S. backing, that unification could happen faster than anyone thought possible – all turned out to be correct. Monetary union would proceed as early as July and the assurances about security kept coming. Hurd reinforced the Baker-Genscher-Kohl message in his meeting with Gorbachev in Moscow, April 11, 1990, saying that Britain clearly “recognized the importance of doing nothing to prejudice Soviet interests and dignity.” (See Document 15)*",,/r/europe/comments/cfj5rj/iconic_photo_from_eastern_ukraine/euaq8bl/,tristes_tigres,1563628869

3213,"&gt;First, you failed to explain why did you lie about women vote - Saudi women vote too.

I never said that Saudi women can't vote at all, I said that they can't vote in parliamentary elections because well, Saudi Arabia doesn't have a parliament, it's an absolute monarchy.

&gt;Doesn't get more absolutist than this. If anything, the Saudi regime is more plural.

It actually does in the case of Saudi Arabia because the Grand Ayatollah is chosen by a council of shia religious leaders while the King of Saudi is directly appointed by his predecessor. Also I don't know on what you're basing your claim that Saudi Arabia is in any way more democratic, freer or more pluralist than Iran. According to pretty much every objective study (like Freedom house or Democracy index) Saudi Arabia scores lower than Iran. 

&gt;Bin Laden's and Al Qaeda's Qutbism has nothing to do with the Saudis'

I guess then it's just a complete coincidence that they happen to support Al Qaeda groups in various countries.

&gt;Fifth, yeah, the Saudis didn't have much of a problem with Bin Laden before Al Qaeda and his global jihadd Qutbist conversion. Why would they?

They didn't have a problem with Bin Laden after Al Qaeda either until he went against American interests. As I mentioned he founded Al Qaeda in 1988 and he was exiled from Saudi Arabia only in 1992.

&gt;Sixth, yeah Saudi Arabia and that branch of AQ are united against the Iranians and their Houthis peons in Yemen.

Oh, well this was an intereseting turn- around. Gotta like the goalpoast move from ""Saudi Arabia has never sponsored terrorist organizations"" to ""Well, they are supporting Al Qaeda in Yemen but it's okay because they're not worse than Hezbollah lol"". First off, that's bullshit, because Al Qaeda is worse than Hezbollah. I mean did Hezbollah cause 9/11? Was Hezbollah killing innocent people in Afghanistan and Pakistan? Was Hezbollah an ally of ISIS? Oh wait no.

&gt;The fact that you start shrieking about some other country in order to deflect criticism off a murderous totalitarian theocracy that will happily be complicit in bombing children with chemical weapons tells us the kind of person you are.

3218,"&gt; But that raised the question of how much can an ISP as Ziggo see?

I'm not sure what you mean.

You mean, like, what could they understand about your traffic, assuming that they can look at the traffic that they are relaying?

Or do you mean what data are they legally-allowed to extract?

There are a couple of ways to block access to a site.  The article pretty-clearly says what they're doing:

&gt; Since September 2017, Ziggo and XS4ALL must block IP addresses of domain names of The Pirate Bay for their customers. The BREIN foundation maintains a list of IP addresses that lead to The Pirate Bay.

So, normally, when you go to a site like www.thepiratebay.org, your computer is going to send out a DNS query for that hostname and wait for a response, which will tell it which IP address that hostname maps to.  Some ISPs look for that DNS request and block requests of that sort, as this can be seen easily, as it's not encrypted.

When you then initiate a connection to the site, https connections also expose the hostname that you are requesting in plain text -- this is done because today many websites must live on a single IP address, and this loss of privacy helps that be handled efficiently.  It's possible to look for that -- I put up a tcpdump rule the other day to show it being done.

Another thing that can be done is to keep a list of ""blacklisted"" IP addresses and simply block all traffic to them.  From the article, it sounds like this is what is being done here:

&gt; Since September 2017, Ziggo and XS4ALL must block IP addresses of domain names of The Pirate Bay for their customers. The BREIN foundation maintains a list of IP addresses that lead to The Pirate Bay.

This is certainly technically-possible.  It does have some limitations:

* It's possible for me to return a different IP address based on the geographical location of the computer requesting the IP address in the DNS query.  CDNs can do this to try to cause a machine to use a nearby server.

* The way thepiratebay.org works is that the database of torrents doesn't change all that much.  As a result, a dump of the site provides enough information to access the torrents.  There are a number of sites that mirror thepiratebay.org; trying to block all of them is probably not realistic.

* VPNs to a VPN service not on the ISP will bypass this.

* Sites that act as a proxy for another website and themselves do not block the content (for example, Google Translate) will return the blocked content.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cfk7s2/isp_in_europe/euajp6m/,vokegaf,1563621897

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg


&gt;Following the outbreak of war in 1939, Stauffenberg and his regiment took part in the attack on Poland. He supported the occupation of Poland and its handling by the Nazi regime and the use of Poles as slave workers to achieve German prosperity[14] as well as German colonization and exploitation of Poland. The deeply rooted belief common in the German aristocracy was that the Eastern territories, populated predominantly by Poles and partly absorbed by Prussia in partitions of Poland, but taken from the German Empire after World War I, should be colonized as the Teutonic Knights had done in the Middle Ages. Stauffenberg said, ""It is essential that we begin a systemic colonization in Poland. But I have no fear that this will not occur"".[15]

...

&gt;in late 1943, he had written out demands with which he felt the Allies had to comply in order for Germany to agree to an immediate peace. These demands included Germany retaining its 1914 eastern borders, including the Polish territories of Wielkopolska and Poznań.[39] Other demands included keeping such territorial gains as Austria and the Sudetenland within the Reich, giving autonomy to Alsace-Lorraine, and even expansion of the current wartime borders of Germany in the south by annexing Tyrol as far as Bozen and Meran. Non-territorial demands included such points as refusal of any occupation of Germany by the Allies, as well as refusal to hand over war criminals by demanding the right of ""nations to deal with its own criminals"". These proposals were only directed to the Western Allies – Stauffenberg wanted Germany only to retreat from western, southern and northern positions, while demanding the right to continue military occupation of German territorial gains in the east.[40]",Europe,/r/europe/comments/cfknpb/75_years_ago_today_colonel_claus_von_stauffenberg/euaju96/,MikeBarTw,1563622076

&gt;The passage is alleged to be not “innocent”
&gt;From Article 19:

&gt;Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.  
The article enumerates a non-exhaustive list of things that are not innocent but the UK is free to make laws adding things to the list providing these are “published” (Article 21). The sanctions on Syria were published.  

But that is not the case as it had stopped 2.5 miles from Gibraltar to take in supplies.

*The documents show that multiple national leaders were considering and rejecting Central and Eastern European membership in NATO as of early 1990 and through 1991, that discussions of NATO in the context of German unification negotiations in 1990 were not at all narrowly limited to the status of East German territory, and that subsequent Soviet and Russian complaints about being misled about NATO expansion were founded in written contemporaneous memcons and telcons at the highest levels.*",,/r/europe/comments/cfj5rj/iconic_photo_from_eastern_ukraine/euak0hi/,tristes_tigres,1563622291

The younger generations in Iran are much more secular and left wing, and they are gradually modernising the country, in all elected positions moderates and progressive are consistently winning. And it was this faction than managed to make the nuclear deal that helped make the country less militaristic and improved the economy by lifting sanctions.

Then, the US very suddenly pulled out of the deal. And they started warmongering. And the conservative columnists and foreign policy think tanks in the US started calling for a near genocide of the Iranian people. 

So how else would they react? If Iran has suddenly pulled out of the deal and started Sabre rattleing, and Iranian columnists started saying that the US should be 'wiped off the map' and the 'world would be better for it' (and keep in mind that the US does have the capability to do this, nuclear annihilation is a real and legitimate fear for Iranians), if all that happened do you think we would just wait to see if they changed their minds back next election?

If Iran has seized one of our tankers first (keeping in mind that it tanker was headed to Saudi Arabia, a country currently committing genocide in Yemen) do you think we would have just done nothing?

&gt; The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d'état (Persian: کودتای ۲۸ مرداد‎), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project[5] or ""Operation Ajax"") and the United Kingdom (under the name ""Operation Boot""), [6][7][8][9] and the first United States covert action to overthrow a foreign government during peacetime.[10]

&gt; Mosaddegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now part of BP) and to limit the company's control over Iranian oil reserves.[11] Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country.[12][13][14] After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically.[15] Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott[16] while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government.[17]:3 Judging Mosaddegh to be unreliable and fearing a Communist takeover in Iran, UK prime minister Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement would set.[17]:3 British intelligence officials′ conclusions and the UK government's solicitations were instrumental in initiating and planning the coup, despite the fact that the U.S. government in 1952 had been considering unilateral action (without UK support) to assist the Mosaddegh government.[18][19][20]

&gt; Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king),[21] to rule more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power.[12][13][14][22] **According to the CIA's declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots on 19 August. Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city.**[23] Between 200[3] and 300[4] people were killed because of the conflict. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.[24][25][26] Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty.[14] After the coup, the Shah continued his rule as monarch for the next 26 years[13][14] until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.[13][14][17]

&gt; **In August 2013, sixty years afterward, the U.S. government formally acknowledged the U.S. role in the coup by releasing a bulk of previously classified government documents that show it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.[27][28][29] The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out ""under CIA direction"" and ""as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government"".**[30]

2. The seizing and capture of a American flagged ship in international waters. 

The second one is less likely as we would basically send the coastguard after the the Revolutionary Guard ships. The first one would be part of a real test of Irans commitment to destroy the US.

3531,"Why though? because the US and Israel accuse us of trying to build nukes? See, I get that we shouldn’t have it. As an Iranian, I don’t even want us to have it but when agencies such as the IAEA confirm that we were not building nukes, how do you just bury your head in the sand and go on saying ‘yes they are’? On what intelligence is this, the same that confined Iraq had nukes?

We have been under sanctions since the revolution so it’s not to do with nukes. It’s to do with greedy countries wanting old and resources that is not theirs or to go back to the days when Iran used to kiss their behinds.

If the threat of nukes in the region is such a worry, why not go after Israel who does have them, not officially, but widely believed they do they do?

I’m not 100% for my countries foreign policies but I am fully in support of them sticking to their guns about the missile programme and access to military sites - sorry about the pun. We, just like the UK, US and Israel (both who have also threatened to destroy us) have a right to defend ourselves should a country decide to attack us again.

We were allies once, it resulted in the overthrowing of our government, supporting the country that attacked us in midst of a revolution, continued support for when that country once our people were chemically bombed and a medal to the Navy officer that shot down a passenger airplane (an apology has not been given to this day).

With all that, I do believe and really wish dialogue is opened and a war is not pursued. I’ve had families die in war and seen what it does to a country. There is no reason why relations can not be peaceful between the countries - both ways. This can only start when the attempt to bully stops and a level of trust is shown.

3571,"&gt; Iran initially rejected those demands and they were included in the nuclear deal. Your sources are about the new deal Donald Trump is making and are not relevant to the old deal.

No they weren't included in any deal. My ""sources"" are about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran deal. There is no ""new deal Trump is making"". 

https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/iran-iaea-no-you-may-not-visit-our-military-sites

https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/09/13/549217764/should-nuclear-inspectors-be-demanding-access-to-irans-military-sites

I mean, there are literally hundreds of articles on this.

It's utterly bizarre you're discussing this issue and think the 24 days period applies to military sites. It doesn't. Iran claims that they don't need to give any access to military sites (unless they want to) - not in 24 days, or 24 weeks, or 24 months or 24 years. 


&gt;This article that's highly critical of the deal backs me up.

Not only that article isn't that critical - in fact it's fairly balanced and presents critical views and supporting views- that article was written in 2015 when the US officials claimed the deal allowed them access to military sites. 

But Iran repeatedly said that wasn't agreed and to this day keeps saying the same. Here's a [long explanation of the issue](http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/Section_T_31Aug2017_Final.pdf):

&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) made at best a general statement in its last quarterly reporting (spring 2017) about its monitoring and verification of Section T, annex 1 of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). This innovative, key section closes a loophole in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), explicitly banning Iran from undertaking certain nuclear weapons development activities and controlling dual-use equipment potentially usable in such activities. At the same time, the Iranian authorities have repeatedly stated that its military sites are off limits to the IAEA, indicating that the IAEA currently has limited or no
access to Iranian military sites.

Feel free to find a source stating that Iran has agreed the IAEA has full access to military sites. You won't. You're simply wrong on this.

&gt; It also backs me up on the fact that while they could hide some parts of a nuclear weapons program, it would be impossible to hide a full scale program due to the radiation levels.

What exactly do you mean by ""nuclear weapons program""? 

Why would they even have a nuclear weapons program going on in an uranium enrichment facility? That would be weird. The issue is: do the 24 days allow them to enrich enough uranium to build a nuclear weapon with little risk of being detected? The only expert cited in your article flat out states it does, so I have no idea why you believe the article supports you.",,/r/europe/comments/cfb037/iran_seizes_britishflagged_oil_tanker/eu9x0wv/,boothofthebeast,1563593371

Since EU sanctions on Syria make shipping oil there a crime, the tanker was impounded by Gibraltarian port authorities.

The UK then offered to release the tanker provided it got guarantees that it would not be heading to Syria, and Iran, having taken responsibility for the Grace 1, refused that offer and threatened to seize UK tankers in retaliation.

The Iranians have now hijacked a UK flagged tanker that was not in their territorial waters and which was underway and thus protected by UNCLOS laws on free navigation.

Actually there are no sanctions that are applicable to Iran. The only sanctions refer to EU country members and in respect with oil, it bans Syria for EXPORTING oil. EU members, with approvals, can EXPORT (Syria IMPORTS) oil to Syria:[https://ec.europa.eu/fpi/what-we-do/sanctions/eu-restrictive-measures-syria-%E2%80%93-faqs\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/fpi/what-we-do/sanctions/eu-restrictive-measures-syria-%E2%80%93-faqs_en)

As such, Iran, which is not constrained by EU sanctions imposed on Syria, can sell them its oil with impunity, at least in respect to EU legislation. JPCOA, to which UK is signatory, removes all sanctions imposed on Iran and allows it to conduct commerce, including with oil products with any other country.

So what UK did in Gibraltar was engaging in coastal piracy, and it acts now as a privateer (HMSs have a long history on that, just ask the Spanish) for Trump regime.

Of course you don't know enough. You didn't even know about the 24 day access period. 

Now you claim the ""experts think it's enough"".

Well, here are two experts. You can check their resumes.

&gt;Section T verification requires the establishment of a routine inspection approach, which takes into account provisions for access to sensitive locations. Unlike the visits associated with the Parchin site3 or past nuclear weapons work, which are fundamentally based on alleging a violation, the verification of Section T conditions is similar to routine inspections of declared nuclear facilities, such as the Natanz enrichment plant. Like those routine inspections at enrichment plants, Section T verification should not be based on alleging violations but instead on ensuring compliance by regular IAEA monitoring. This last point is important because discussions have frequently mischaracterized the verification of Section T as a problem of finding violations via national means and then reporting them to the IAEA for follow-up. In fact, the nature of Section T conditions is analogous to verifying that allowed activities and equipment are not misused, as is common to many aspects of IAEA safeguards at declared nuclear sites. Inspectors do not go to the Natanz enrichment plant because of allegations that Iran is secretly producing highly enriched uranium; they go there routinely to provide confidence that Iran is living up to its commitments not to produce enriched uranium outside of safeguards and within the parameters set by the JCPOA. Although Section T conditions have not been institutionalized under traditional safeguards, their inclusion in the JCPOA was a recognition of the need to do so and Iran’s obligation to cooperate in fulfilling these commitments.

The whole document is worth reading.

Do you want more experts?

[This](https://thebulletin.org/2015/07/the-experts-assess-the-iran-agreement-of-2015/) is from William H. Tobey  (Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs)

&gt;The nuclear deal reached on July 14, 2015 between six world powers and Iran is baffling. It raises many important questions and leaves others unanswered. For example:

&gt;Why, if it is dangerous today for Iran to be two months away from a nuclear weapon—as Secretary of State John Kerry patiently explained in Congressional testimony last year—is it acceptable for Tehran to be in such a position 10 to 15 years from now?

&gt;Why does the deal undermine existing International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) authorities under the Additional Protocol by extending the timeline for inspecting suspect sites from 24 hours to 24 days—or more?

&gt;Why, after insisting in an April interview that Iran must come clean on what the IAEA calls the possible military dimensions of its program before a deal is completed, telling journalist Judy Woodruff, not once, but twice, “it will be done,” did Secretary Kerry agree to defer the issue to a future and uncertain resolution in December?

&gt;Why would Western negotiators have any confidence that this time Iran will provide a complete and correct declaration to the IAEA with respect to the possible military dimensions of its program, when it has serially failed to do so since 2011?

&gt;Why, given the trench warfare over every provision of the deal, the Supreme Leader’s rant that the agreement changes nothing with respect to Iran’s hostility toward the United States and Israel, and President Rouhani’s gloating about how favorable the deal is to his country, would anyone believe that the agreement provides anything more than a speed bump on the path to Iran’s nuclear ambitions?

&gt;Why is that speed bump a good trade for at least $150 billion in sanctions relief, access to international arms markets, and international blessing for Iran’s nuclear ambitions at the conclusion of the deal?

There are a lot more ""experts"" against the deal. So, that sort of juvenile, childish, argument ""But experts say"" is totally and utterly useless. 

Now to be fair, what the IAEA says isn't that Iran isn't developing nuclear weapons. 

What the IAEA states is that they have **no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapons program in Iran**. 

This is a subtle but hugely important distinction. Absence of proof isn't proof of absence. The problem with the JCPOA is that it was a deal made entirely for political reasons, to allow them to say ""Oh, but we've a deal in place and Iran allows inspections, and we still haven't found any evidence of a nuclear weapons program"".",,/r/europe/comments/cfb037/iran_seizes_britishflagged_oil_tanker/eu9pg7c/,Jooana,1563586983

&gt;Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar can now confirm, after having received the results of comprehensive laboratory testing, that the Very Large Crude Carrier, the Grace 1, which was detained in the early hours of Thursday morning, is loaded to capacity with crude oil. 

&gt;The results of these tests conclusively prove and confirm the information disseminated last week by the Gibraltar Government and contradict the statements of some commentators from outside the jurisdiction who had speculated that the cargo on the vessel was not crude.

&gt;**The Grace 1 was detained last week in Gibraltar when it freely navigated into British Gibraltar Territorial Waters to a point two miles off the Eastside of Gibraltar, having previously exited the international waters of the Straits of Gibraltar, on a pre-arranged call for provisions and spare parts.** 

&gt;The Grace 1's position well inside BGTW when boarded can clearly be seen on the attached screenshot.  The ship remains detained in that area.

3851,"Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar can now confirm, after having received the results of comprehensive laboratory testing, that the Very Large Crude Carrier, the Grace 1, which was detained in the early hours of Thursday morning, is loaded to capacity with crude oil. 

The results of these tests conclusively prove and confirm the information disseminated last week by the Gibraltar Government and contradict the statements of some commentators from outside the jurisdiction who had speculated that the cargo on the vessel was not crude.

The Grace 1 was detained last week in Gibraltar when it freely navigated into British Gibraltar Territorial Waters to a point two miles off the Eastside of Gibraltar, having previously exited the international waters of the Straits of Gibraltar, on a pre-arranged call for provisions and spare parts. 

The Grace 1's position well inside BGTW when boarded can clearly be seen on the attached screenshot.  The ship remains detained in that area.

The detention of the vessel relates to the suspected destination of the cargo, the Banyas refinery in Syria, which is owned by a company, the Banyas Oil Refinery Company.  This company is the subject of European Union sanctions under EU Regulation 36/2012, which is directly applicable in Gibraltar.

 &gt;or has sponsored terrorist organizations like Hezbollah (the actual state, not individuals)

Actually yes. In fact the groups that were/are receiving Saudi money are much worse than Hezbollah. We are talking about Al Qaeda here, with whom the Saudis are in league with in Yemen and in Syria (at least used to be, I'm not sure to what extent are they involved in Syria lately).

But also, even if we ignore the international presence of Saudi Arabia, it doesn't take an expert to see that Saudi Arabia is much worse in terms of human rights and support a much more regressive interpretation of Islam than Iran. Don't get me wrong, Iran is a horrible theocracy but it has a parliament, it has political pluralism and it has regular elections where everyone, both men and women can vote. That's not even nearly the case with Saudi Arabia, which is a straight up absolute monarchy where every position of power is held by the Saudi royal family. Women not only can't vote, they can't even leave the house without their husband or a ""male guardian"". Ffs until recently, they weren't even allowed to drive. 

&gt;More importantly, why do you feel the need to resort to whataboutism to defend Iran?

It's not whataboutism, it's directly connected to what you were talking about. You complained about how Iran is a murderous anti-semitic theocratic regime that supports terrorism.

While some of the measures put on place by the EU were really divisive and unpopular in certain countries (migration quotas), many of these actions had a decent cause, like limiting judicial ""reforms"" in Poland or harvesting Białowieża forest. These actions did deserve a reaction from the EU.

If it's cut behind the clitellum, then the common earthworm will grow back its tail from the front half but the rear part will die. Worms in general though can vary significantly because there are a huge number of species classified as 'worms'. Bristle worms, a type of annelid (the same category as earthworms belong too) can actually produce asexually and some exclusively do so. There's also a number we still don't know huge amounts about. One of the other notable groups of worms, nematoads (roundworms) are an absolutely enormous category and undoubtedly countless species we still have much to learn about, and if I'm not mistaken some species have shown flat out bizarrely extreme regenerative capabilities.

Why use such a definitive statement? It only weakens your credibility. If its ONLY homegrown, that means there was not a single terrorist attack by an immigrant, which is obviously not true.

&gt; Rather, native citizens appear to be committing terrorism because of their hostility to immigrants.

[Here is a breakdown of the historical attempts for Turkey to buy air defense systems.](https://turkeywonk.wordpress.com/2012/11/09/why-doesnt-turkey-have-its-own-patriots/)

From the article:
&gt; During the 1990s, Ankara became acutely aware of the proliferation of missiles in the Middle East. This prompted Turkey’s leadership to identify missile defense as critical for the nation’s future security. **Turkey first turned to Israel in 1997 for the Arrow missile system**.  The Arrow was designed specifically to intercept scuds, and is seen as better suited to Turkey’s defense needs than Patriot. As the Arrow’s primary funder, the United States had to approve of the export of the equipment. During the 1990s, however, **the U.S. was against deal and argued against the transfer of the system to Turkey. (This had to do mainly with the Missile Technology Control Regime restrictions on missile exports) In the early 2000s, the United States dropped its objections and joined the negotiations.** The three sides eventually envisioned the joint development of a Turkish ballistic missile defense system with either Patriot or Arrow. **The Turkish financial crisis eventually froze the discussions, though Israeli and Turkish officials did continue to hold some talks for missile defense sales.**

&gt; Turkey approached the United States’ Raytheon for the Patriot PAC-3, Russia’s Rosoboronexport for the S-300,  China’s Precision Machinery Export Import Corp (CPMIEC) for the HQ9 FD-2000, and the Italian-French Eurosam for the SAMP/T Aster 30. **Critically, Raytheon was not offering to transfer technology. Eurosam, on the other hand, was willing to transfer critical design information to Turkish defense contractors (Hold on to this for a second).**

&gt;Information about the nature of the Russian deal is not available, though Turkey was hoping that Rosoboronexport would offer the S-400. NATO made clear that it preferred Turkey choose either the American or European system. Officials also made clear that if Turkey chose the Russian or Chinese system, Turkey’s missile defense could not be integrated into NATO’s missile defense system.

&gt;**Surprisingly, Turkey cancelled the tender in 2012 and chose not to purchase any of the competitors missile systems.** While the reason was never released, it appears likely that Ankara wanted access to the design information. Raytheon  – which had always been rumored to have been Ankara’s number one choice  – made clear that it was not willing to transfer technology. Raytheon’s terms likely  included provisions to “black box” critical technologies. **The fact that Turkey chose not to purchase missile defense at all – even though Eurosam was offering technology transfer – suggests that Ankara was intent on Patriot from the outset, but wanted to try and force Raytheon to make a concessions.**

Sooo, it just looks like time and again Ankara wanted Patriots with technological transfer. The one time when you could have gotten a deal was in the early 2000 with the Israeli system but that fell because of financial troubles. The US (actually Raytheon, the private contractor who owns the technology) never changed their position on the Patriot. Either buy it as a black-box or leave it.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/cerfyo/russia_ready_to_deliver_su35_fighter_jets_to/eu7tjip/,this_toe_shall_pass,1563542507

Firstly: The Dutch state is 10% liable, not the troops. The troops were acting under the United Nations banner

Secondly: The state is only 10% liable for the deaths of 350 Bosnian Muslim men. A total of 7000 men were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.

These 350 men were amongst 5000 Bosnian Muslim men taking refuge at the Dutch base. Dutch soldiers were guiding them towards busses for evacuation. After Srebrenica fell, an additional 20.000 people sought refuge at the compound, making a total of 25.000 people. The Dutch state and the UN together decided to evacuate these people. This is where the Dutch state's liability comes in. 

While evacuation was going on, Serbian soldiers were picking men out of the crowd, supposedly to investigate whether they committed any crimes. Instead, general Mladic had them executed.

The court ruled that Dutchbat was aware that there was a risk of maltreatment and execution, and therefore should have offered the men the option to stay on the compound.",,/r/europe/comments/cf5hub/dutch_troops_10_liable_for_srebrenica_massacre/eu7kubb/,WT965,1563535183

I took an example this far back on purpose, because if you talk about a people that is several thousand years old you can't solely judge it on recent history, and because there was no bigger uprising in Europe before that, which prevents counter-arguments about copying other peoples.

Germans couldn't be united for 2000 years because of their problems with authority. Even Tacitus' talked about the German tribes valuing their freedom above all else. How is that a people that ""has always been quite obedient""?

If you want a more recent example of the German people revolting against their state, take the March Revolution, the November Revolution, or the countless individuals protesting the GDR, many even risking or losing their lives by doing so.

I hadn't even considered that. It makes perfect sense for why the Danes would want to distance themselves, but from what I understand the Denmark-Sweden rivalry is actually stronger from the Swedish side due to their subjugation under the Kalmar Union. The Kalmar Union on its own is an interesting thing to study, since it essentially was a Scandinavian Federation with the Danish monarchy being the head of state and the Swedish and Norwegian aristocracy running their own countries more or less independently, but that the hatred towards the Danes from the Swedish aristocracy would have filtered so thoroughly to the people that it's still a relevant thing half a millennia later is strange.  
  
&gt;it wasn't nearly quite as poor as norwegians like to imagine.  
  
I'm not Norwegian, but fair enough.  
  
&gt; Hardly. Keeping Sweden and Denmark on a balance was a significant continous objective for large parts of Europe. A united Sweden and Denmark would give them a severe stranglehold on the baltic sea trade which other nations, especially the Dutch and English, could not abide by.  
  
I think you've misunderstood me. My point is that a united Sweden-Denmark-Norway(-Finland-Estonia-Iceland) would have been a strong state, and controlling the Baltic is a big part of that. All you'd really need for that anyway is Denmark controlling Scania, which was historically the case anyway. Kattegatt is quite defendable, it's how it got that name in the first place. The Zeland archipelago alone could be fortified to a similar effect as Gibraltar. We are absolutely in agreement that essentially every powerful state with a coast in the baltic sea, or with trade interests in it, would want to keep Sweden and Denmark separate. But the weaker baltic states would have a lot to gain from controlling passage, so to me this should only incentivise a union state, and not just for Sweden and Denmark.",Россия,/r/europe/comments/cf2e90/what_do_you_know_about_the_united_kingdoms_of/eu7e39l/,KrasnayaDruzhina,1563528022

4531,"Yes, it is not always true to take publicly expressed opinions at face value and conclude that this must be the real opinions and motivations. I certainly think that politicians lie to the public sometimes. 

I struggle to see the motivation in this specific case though. What could be a reason why politicians are against EU legislation? I think the most likely reasons are that they are convinced it is bad for their country or not compatible with their political program. This should be a pretty popular opinion for them to express to the press and their supporters. If the press asks them about this act of EU legislation that seems to hurt the country or be against their political program, what should be the motivation of a minister to give the answer publicly that they are not opposing it?

My second concern with your theory is that ministers vote in the Council but they are not there in their personal capacity, they represent the government. The vote of a country is determined by the government, not the person who happens to sit there on this day. This makes it somewhat harder to lie to the public because you have to coordinate that with your other ministers in the cabinet. You have to basically all agree to conspire with your other ministers to lie to the public, to conceal your opposition to an act, to vote ""abstain"" and to coordinate your lies so that you all tell the same fake story when someone asks you about the government opinion regarding this EU legislation. Governments are places where information regularly leaks to the press so you would expect that if a dozen ministers in two dozen countries regularly conspire to lie to the public and conceal their opposition to EU legislation that this would sometimes leak to the press or that some ministers would talk about it after they retire.

4587,"&gt;It really wasn't about eurobons, it was just an example,

As i said, i didn't read further, because this stupid topic of Eurobonds that get's brought up again and again must finally die.

Anytime i see it, i will come down hard on it. Because the mentioning of Eurobonds does not good, it only creates harm. People might believe they are a magical solution to our problems, when in fact it's not only not a solution, it's an impossibility.

Tell me, did you know about this little problem of combining Eurobonds with Germany before i brought it up? Most likely no, but now you do and so will you when they get mentioned the next time.

Meaning we can spend our time searching for actual solutions to the problem the Euro has instead of further working on a castle in the air.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/cewpxo/die_welt_europe_is_not_just_paris_and_london_the/eu77vss/,Alcobob,1563521093
4588,"&gt;The term Deluge (Polish: pоtор szwedzki, Lithuanian: švedų tvanas) denotes a series of mid-17th-century campaigns in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In a wider sense it applies to the period between the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648 and the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667, thus comprising the Polish theatres of the Russo-Polish and Second Northern Wars.[5] In a stricter sense, the term refers to the Swedish invasion and occupation of the Commonwealth as a theatre of the Second Northern War (1655–1660) only; In Poland and Lithuania this period is called the Swedish Deluge (Polish: potop szwedzki, Swedish: Svenska syndafloden), or less commonly the Russo–Swedish Deluge (Polish: Potop szwedzko-rosyjski)[6] due to the Russian invasion in 1654.[7] The term deluge (or potop in Polish) was popularized by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his novel The Deluge (1886). 

&gt;During the wars the Commonwealth lost approximately one third of its population as well as its status as a great power due to invasions by Sweden and Russia.[8] According to Professor Andrzej Rottermund, manager of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, the destruction of Poland in the deluge was more extensive than the destruction of the country in World War II. Rottermund claims that Swedish invaders robbed the Commonwealth of its most important riches, and most of the stolen items never returned to Poland.[9] Warsaw, the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was completely destroyed by the Swedes, and out of a pre-war population of 20,000, only 2,000 remained in the city after the war.[10] According to the 2012 Polish estimates, financial losses of Poland are estimated at 4 billion złotys. Swedish and Russian invaders completely destroyed 188 cities and towns, 81 castles, and 136 churches in Poland.

I'm not talking only about donations to the poor when I'm talking about welfare for the rich. You also get tax breaks on donating to political parties.

Poorer people cannot afford to donate so much, meaning richer people can divert more public money into their party of choice. Yes, they don't get it back directly in cash but they do wield disproportionate influence in the political system as a result. (which, as the article points out, can pay off big time - in cash)

The article also points out that these charitable donations could very well allow the billionaires to have a say in the reconstruction. But half that say is actually paid by public money, while all of the power is still in the hands of the donor. Again, not a cash pay out but still a pay out of sorts.

So the death penalty doesn't deter at all from such acts but even ends up being an encouraging factor.

In terms of pure deterrence, what would actually work best (not saying that it's what should be done) would be to make sure and known that jihadists in prisons end up as prison bitches, with cell mates that give them special help with their ""prayer"" position five times a day. 

Of course, that wouldn't be the civilized way to go… but for that matter, neither is the death penalty. So the latter really makes no sense for a penal system.

Fair enough.. go on.. 

&gt; The best point the article makes is when it speaks of how there is no talk of punishing Germany or other northern countries for not going for debt centralization the way there has been talk of punishing those who don't want to take refugees. This despite the fact that the lack of debt centralization is far more dangerous to the stability of the EU and as much against EU values as refusing refugees is.

Very populistical, raised practically the voice of ""stupid"" (basically, there were ignorant and stupid people always in the USA, like everywhere else -- they just didn't have grounds and a voice).. 

But, the only thing is that in our case that voice exists since we left communism and have gradually gotten weaker (and slowly we're still getting better); However there are quite a lot of politicians which still are exactly like this backed by a lot of stupid and a lot of people that are simply used to populists (regardless of their political stance or direction -- left or right);

The rethoric used by them in the eastern bloc (as in east of Berlin wall) will definitely be similar to the one republicans use now. 

**Real example** from my country (Romania): A lot of polititians said that ""We weren't allowed in Schengen (no border-checks area // common visa) because Netherlands has some big ports and are afraid of ours from Constanta competing with theirs"". 

That's an old port in the Black Sea (it's competition would be ports from Turkey, Italy, Croatia.. Not Netherlands). The port is unmaintened, run-down. It still doesn't have a connection via motorways to cross our country. And the best of all, Schengen is not about the cargo, we're already in the EU (thus the customs union). Any border checks on the way are easy once customs for the cargo is done.

**Imaginary example** so you can get a feel of what **sometimes** happens: If someone tells our politicians that we have 70 bridges that need urgent maintenance they somehow will end up saying how Germany has 100 km of poorly paved road in need of urgent maintenance and tell it's critics that they have a double-standard..

4844,"&gt;The Cypriot S-300 crisis was a tense and rapidly escalating political standoff between the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Turkey between early 1997 and late 1998. The confrontation was sparked by Cypriot plans to install two Russian-made S-300 air-defence missile sites on their territory, provoking Turkey into threatening an attack or even all-out war if the missiles were not returned to Russia. The missile deal with Russia represented the Cyprus government's first serious attempt at building a credible air defence system after all the years of Turkish superiority in the air.

&gt;The crisis effectively ended in December 1998 with the decision of the Cypriot government to transfer the S-300s to Greece's Hellenic Air Force in exchange for alternative weapons from Greece. The crisis also led to the collapse of Cyprus's coalition government. Greece's Hellenic Air Force installed the system on the island of Crete and as of 2016 the S-300s still operate there.

&gt;On 13 December 2013, and for the first time since the missile system was acquired, it was tested in Crete.The launch was carried out as part of the White Eagle 2013 military exercise and was described as “successful.”

    Crete Naval Base (Greek: Ναύσταθμος Κρήτης, Nafstathmos Kritis) is a major naval base of the Hellenic Navy and NATO at Souda Bay in Crete, Greece.

&gt;Also known as Naval Support Activity Souda Bay,[1] and more commonly as the Souda Bay Naval Base (Greek: Ναυτική Βάση Σούδας, Naftiki Vasi Soudas), it serves as the second largest (in numbers of battleships harboured) naval base of the Hellenic Navy and the largest and most prominent naval base for the United States and NATO in the eastern Mediterranean Sea

&gt;The American aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) sails out of the Souda Bay harbor in Crete, Greece, following a four-day port visit to Greece's largest island.

&gt;The Naval Support Activity Souda Bay's Security Department soldiers stand a security watch in front of the French aircraft carrier FS Charles DeGaulle (R 91) as it docks at the Marathi NATO pier facility in Souda Bay.

&gt;A Qatar Emiri Air Force Dassault Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet takes off as part of a Joint Task Force Odyssey Dawn mission, at Souda Bay.

Please cite a credentialed psychologist confirming that being in favour of a religious immigration ban, specifically, is what is normal in human psychology and the opposite is abnormal.

&gt; And I don't see how my links does not prove a majority of westerns agree with the government points of view of Hungary and Poland in these topics?

Because that not quite what your links say. You are extrapolating. Respondents are asked if ""all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped"". Does this mean respondents, if they fully comprehend what they're being asked, want to duplicate Hungary and Poland's policies wholesale? A majority might like the idea, but I bet if you asked them, they'd have no idea what an actual execution of such a policy would entail.

&gt; Yes, other issues are more important and they were for me as well, but that only proves that we are forced to vote against our migration views

4914,"&gt; They're impacted most by changes

https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/

Immigration has small impact on average wages but more significant impacts along the wage distribution: low-waged workers lose while medium and high-paid workers gain. So low skill workers feel more negative economic pressure.

&gt; Please cite a credentialed psychologist confirming that being in favour of a religious immigration ban, specifically, is what is normal in human psychology and the opposite is abnormal.

I'd need to get back to you in September on that one, as that's when I'll have access to my university courses. I don't have time to an extensive research right now to find back something I learned from coursebooks 10+ years ago.

&gt; Respondents are asked if ""all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped"". Does this mean respondents, if they fully comprehend what they're being asked, want to duplicate Hungary and Poland's policies wholesale? A majority might like the idea, but I bet if you asked them, they'd have no idea what an actual execution of such a policy would entail.

So? Poland and Hungary are very vocal against that type of migration and a majority of westerners shares that sentiment and not the sentiment of their own government with regards to this type of migration. 

Obviously the general sentiment is more against this type of migration in Central Europe than in Western Europe, which my links shows as well, but it is shows a majority preferring different policies than the ones their politicians present them with. Majorities in favor, yet no country and no centrist party is.

&gt; Or, the parties in question aren't as leftist as you say they are, and moreover, voters are perfectly content back-benching their migration views for more important policy priorities, as explained in my previous post, with citation. They are literally more concerned about other things.

Yes, so? A tiny minority would put gay rights on the top of their priority list and vote according to that one issue, does that mean that governments should just ignore gay rights because so few make that a make or break issue in the ballot box? When approving gay marriage, the left has no issue using polls of ""do you support gay marriage?"" to prove a majority supports it and so should the government, so why is this not valid with regards to migration policies? Suddenly the one issue question isnt valid because there are other higher ranked issue?

Racism does not really mean just hate people with different skin color. I mean yes sure Germans and Poles are both white, yet they are different in their genetics. And the Nazis used that to build their propaganda around it. What is a race and how many races are their in the world? The concept of race is not that accurate but makes sense when looking at the US history. Each group present at that time was easy distinguishable from each other, that is why the different races were so useful, when looking at other parts of the world it is not that easy. Just tell me which race are Turkish, Sudanese or Siberian people, pretty hard to tell. Those things we call races are just categories for us to sort other human into, based on some definition people once defined. The genetic differences within sub-Saharan Africa are bigger than in the rest of the world. A Japanese,a French, and a native American have more similar genes than two persons from different tribes in Africa. But the first three are belonging to 3 different races, both persons from Africa are just black. Maybe that illustrates that just because you ""share the  same race"" does not mean you are genetically similar. The terms ""white"", ""black"", ""Caucasian"", ""mongoloid"", ""negroid"" etc were defined in a time where many people believed that humans developed separately from each other and do not share the same origin. Plus DNA encoding was not possible and we had no objective way of determining the genetic relations of people, just the very biased methods based on their looks and some archeology. I just hope people see that the racial categories we use are not exactly scientific correct and cause many people to have completely wrong ideas about race and ethnicity.

The U.K. != the E.U.

&gt;  I don't have time to an extensive research right now to find back something I learned from coursebooks 10+ years ago.

Snark is no substitute for evidence, I'm afraid, no matter how insulting you might genuinely find it that I'm asking for evidence in the first place. And am being strict &amp; rigorous about it.

&gt; Poland and Hungary are very vocal against that type of migration and a majority of westerners shares that sentiment

But they often don't share a preference for the extremist, corrupted nature of those governments, as well as the concomitant extremism when they executive refugee and migrant policies.

Majorities of populations aren't always right, either: that would be an [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum), and what they propose is a [human rights violation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-muslim-travel-ban-illegal-un-rights-chief-a7552991.html). You have to smirk at the bitter irony of far-rightists advocating for the very measures that would make them little better than the more authoritarian Islamic regimes and theocracies. I'm reminded of Mecca's Christian, Jew and atheist ban. Basically a ban on all non-Muslims: i.e. the inverse.

&gt;  and not the sentiment of their own government with regards to this type of migration. 

This depends on the government in question. Besides, you've left for New Zealand. If you feel this strongly about immigration, why did you emigrate? Isn't that a tad bit hypocritical?

&gt; Yes, so? A tiny minority would put gay rights on the top of their priority list and vote according to that one issue

I'm not sure I should automatically accept that it is a ""tiny minority"". 

&gt; does that mean that governments should just ignore gay rights because so few make that a make or break issue in the ballot box? 

Two things.

1. You're changing the subject. The subject wasn't ""ought"". The subject was ""is"";
2. Human rights reinforcement is different from human rights violation (""Muslim ban""); I'm sure you grasp this difference;
3. You don't even know governments in the E.U. are all completely out of sync with their populations; many governments have grown increasingly harsh on immigration.

[U.S. activates Romanian missile defense site, angering Russia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-shield/u-s-activates-romanian-missile-defense-site-angering-russia-idUSKCN0Y30JX)

&gt;DEVESELU, Romania (Reuters) - The United States switched on an $800 million missile shield in Romania on Thursday that it sees as vital to defend itself and Europe from so-called rogue states but the Kremlin says is aimed at blunting its own nuclear arsenal. 
&gt;
&gt; To the music of military bands at the remote Deveselu air base, senior U.S. and NATO officials declared operational the ballistic missile defense site, which is capable of shooting down rockets from countries such as Iran that Washington says could one day reach major European cities. 
&gt;
&gt; “As long as Iran continues to develop and deploy ballistic missiles, the United States will work with its allies to defend NATO,” said U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work, standing in front of the shield’s massive gray concrete housing that was adorned with a U.S. flag.

5264,"&gt; And yet this doesn't prevent some people from making broad, strong statements like 77% of the world's cities will experience a striking change in climate.

Some people like climate researchers. That actually understand the processes involved. Look at Chenai today, wouldn't you say they are experiencing a striking change in climate? That city gets almost half the precipitation it used to get and that from the fucking monsoon. 

Big cities in Eastern Europe, do you remember winters 20 years ago and winters in recent years? Pump that up to 11. 

&gt; Climate is chaotic, right? I mean, not even the most radical climate changers dispute that statement.

Some components of climate are chaotic. The radiative forcing from atmospheric CO2 is most definitely deterministic on longer time scales than you seem to be able to entertain. I'm talking about at least multi-decadal trends here. 

&gt; Well, one of the first things you do when dealing with a chaotic system is you compute/approximate/guess its Lyapunov exponents which directly allows you to estimate that system's Lyapunov time
I have never seen such an estimation for the planet's climate.

But on the /r/romania thread about this publication you were claiming in a top level comment that you did an overview of studies on the topic and found scientific consensus that this estimation is ~5-10 years. You mean to tell me you were talking out of your ass???
I mean, of course such a consensus doesn't exist because such an analysis (Lyapunov time) is pointless for systems such as those used in climate models. But let me help you with actual studies done on the chaotic nature of these models. [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257811982_Climate_Predictions_The_Chaos_and_Complexity_in_Climate_Models) is an article on this very topic. From the article conclusions:

&gt;Firstly, we have pointed out on occurrence of chaos in computing the environmental interface temperature from the energy balance equation when the given differential equation is replaced by a difference equation. For that purpose we have analysed a coupled system of equations, often used in climate models. It is shown that the Lyapunov exponent mostly has positive  values approving  presence of  chaos in  this  system, but  there are still  some strait 
regions  where the Lyapunov  exponent is negative  and where the  solutions of the coupled system are stable.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/cdevyi/how_will_climate_change_impact_cities_by_2050/eu55mhw/,this_toe_shall_pass,1563470401

5287,"Geopolitically, most experts have seen erdogan as incompetent. This is because Russia and Turkey have shared geography that both need to claim to maintain a more complete national security. No matter what the nations do(barring a complete abolition of hostilities on the level of US and Canada) there's nothing that will allow them to be full allies. In addition, Turkey is trying to position itself as an independent power when it's economy has been doing terribly and it does not have the resources to be an independent power. It is trading a better partner for a worse one. It's true the US support of kurds was not favorable to Turkey's interests, however the US made it clear that kurdish support was dependent on their ability to fight ISIS. Now that ISIS is more or less demolished, the US has more or less withdrawn Kurdish support, just like the US told Turkey they would do. 

The reason that Turkey wants the S400 is because they couldn't get Patriot, and the reason they couldn't get Patriot is because unlike all other US partners, Turkey requested technology transfer, which obviously was out of grounds for the US. And the US made it clear that a not so clear ally cannot have the S400 and the F-35. And that's fine, they made their choice, but overall it was a bad one because Turkey is slowly making an enemy of the west, and the east med conference shows that the US has plenty of strategic alternatives. 

In the event of conflict, Turkey and Russia will be battling for the same land, whereas the west and China will sit back because it's not their problem now that Turkey is slowly turning it's back on the west. 

Both parties have problems, however the west has mostly been responding to Turkey's increasing attempts at independence. And that is a valid choice to make in a purely philosophical sense, but now Turkey has no power blocs blocking them, and unlike non-aligned countries like say Oman or India, Turkey is destroying it's alliances on all sides by setting up an alliance that cannot last, and destroying long held alliances for short term gain.

The US isn't required to keep Turkey happy if Turkey persistently takes actions that are contrary to US interests. In the end, both have some blame, but the relationship has been degrading for well over decade, and most of it has initiated from the Turkish side. That said, I don't think ""blame"" is the way to frame it. More like Turkey has pursued interests that are contrary to NATO, and if they are no longer interested in helping the west, so be it.

It's more of a self-identification issue - today only a minority identify as a separate Rusyn nation, the majority see themselves as Ukrainians.

That's literally the definition of this principle. E.g., from [Oxford dictionary](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100027515)

&gt;*jus sanguinis*

&gt;The principle that the **nationality of children is the same as that of their parents**, irrespective of their place of birth. This contrasts with *jus soli*, whereby nationality is dependent on place of birth. In states in which the jus sanguinis principle applies (i.e. France and Germany), a conflict of jurisdiction may arise when a child is born of parents who are citizens of another state. For example, a child born in the United States of French parents is an American citizen jure soli, but a French citizen jure sanguinis.

Russia is a *jus sanguinis* country with minor additions of *jus solei*.

&gt; All that you say are not excuses.

They absolutely are. All of international relations can be summed up with ""tit for tat"". Russia started the war for no other reason other than imperialism so that reasoning isn't worth anything. Ukraine is really under no obligation to follow the Minsk agreement if Russia doesn't. Which is the whole point of my initial comment. Russia never follows agreements that it itself signs. 

&gt; Establish a ceasefire (done initially, but currently is barely functional);

Yup. Since pro-russian ""separatists"" never followed Minsk agreement I don't see why Ukraine should.

&gt; Adopt a constitutional reform to decentralize the power and give status to those two regions;

Precedent was set by Russia and pro-russian ""separatists"" to not abide by the Minsk agreement so I don't see why Ukraine should.

&gt; Adopt a general amnesty for those who did not commit war crimes during the conflict.

Precedent was set by Russia and pro-russian ""separatists"" to not abide by the Minsk agreement so I don't see why Ukraine should.

I agree though that Ukraine isn't abiding by the Minsk agreement. But you know... Ukraine didn't start the war.

&gt; Under the blind eye of the European partners who co-signed the agreement together with Russia — nothing has been done.

Sure, why not. I agree.

&gt; Added to that the discrimination of the Russian speaking population of Ukraine (almost half of total number)

Wanna add the discrimination of Ukraine by Russia by starting a war and killing Ukrainians for no reason? Something something international law something something war crimes. 

&gt; **Russian Federation is more than justified under the International Law to take steps to secure its interests.**

This is where you lose me. Under international law Russia has broken every rule in the book before the Minsk agreement was even signed.

You don't need evidence. When you have developed such a weapon you take all measures to avoid any possible disadvantage. 

&gt; Turkey will reverse engineer and check the s400

Yeah that is not going to happen. Russia is not some kind of fool. 

&gt; The US doesn't want Turkey to have advanced defence measures against ballistic missiles or aircraft, certainly doesn't want Turkey to produce their own.

That is the heart of the issue. Turkey must be dependent on USA according to USA. It must be strong and stable, but not too strong.

&gt;  The fact btw that it's ok for Israel to fly F35s over Russian manned s400 and no one batting and eye while everyone starts to freak out because Turkey is flying over it's own s400 is rather sad and dumb

It is not the same. Israel's F-35 don't communicate with S-400. Turkey claims that S-400 would not communicate with its F-35, but that is not believable, and you don't need evidence for that, just reasonable suspicions.

&gt; ...US could stop acting like a schoolyard bully...

Turkey acting as a bully for decades based on US support makes this sentence delightfully ironic. 

&gt; Russian technicians won't be working on the Turkish s400 from what I know

Then you don't know. Oversimplifying S-400 consists of 4 parts. Technology transfer and training turkish engineers does not mean that Turkey could build S400 from scratch. It is part of the technology transfered and part of the systems foreign engineers are trained. Missile systems is the pinacle of Russian technology, you think they just give it away for people to ""reverse engineer"" them?

&gt; ...your prices are unreasonable, the refusal to give source codes etc....

Ireland’s primary objective from the beginning has always been to prevent a hard border. From our perspective everything else is secondary because for us it’s about maintaining peace in the aftermath of a UK decision we can’t control.

What the UK wants and the economic consequences of maintaining that peace are completely secondary to us. That’s the will of the Irish people and Varadkar has unanimous political support in this position which given the UKs current political situation they should realise unanimous political support in anything is extremely rare.

In the case of Brexit, its the UK that has chosen a path that removes them from the E.U. single market and customs union. Obviously, we have no say in this, that’s a UK decision we have to deal with.

The consequence of their decision fundamentally requires checks between the UK and E.U. as that is the nature of being in different customs union with different standards. 

So how can Ireland do anything whatsoever in this scenario to prevent a hard border? 

1. We were able to help convince the E.U. to allow NI special status in the E.U. to allow them remain in the single market, effectively allowing NI to be a link to both the UK and E.U. markets. With border controls run by an independent country not in the E.U. This was a big concession on the EUs part but rejected by the UK.

2. We were able to help convince E.U. to allow the whole of the UK to remain in the EU customs union via the UK wide backstop. This would effectively allow the UK access to the E.U. single market for goods but without needing freedom of movement all they needed to do was maintain regulatory alignment. This is an insane concession from the E.U. effectively allowing the UK as a third party state to break the 4 freedoms.  This wasn’t good enough, the UK said no.

No matter the concession the UK continued to say no. It’s is an impossible situation. Clearly no matter the concession the UK will leave the customs union.
Being outside the customs union, trade deal or not, fundamentally means a hard border. 

So Ireland is now left with two options. A hard border against its will (no deal) and a hard border that it accepts (EU/UK trade agreement but outside the customs union)

Regardless of the concessions given and the best will of Ireland, the UKs decisions lead to a hard border in Ireland. 

It’s not Leo’s gamble that is costing us dearly, it’s the decisions made by the UK that is costing us dearly.

So Ireland is left with two choices jump off the cliff or be pushed.

Europe has also sided recently with Iran over the nuclear “deal”.

Turkey is now buying Russian heavy arms that threaten US assets, going out of their way to ruin a strategic alliance.

So given this change, why should the US continue to support Europe militarily?

5521,"&gt; I don't know what else to say here. He overdose and not realizing that overdosing can seriously alter your behaviour should not be an excuse for the actions he caused. He should have realized. If you kill someone accidently because you got drunk and overrun a pedestrian, you also cannot use this ""I did not realize I would not be able to drive so well under influence"" card.

That's a different situation. 

Everyone knows that alcohol impedes your ability to drive, so if you drink alcohol, get into a car, and drive someone over, that's your fault.

By contrast, if you drink alcohol, and the alcohol reacts badly with a medical condition (that you were unaware of) and as a result you turn hyper violent and beat someone to death that's *not* your fault, because strong aggression (to the degree of making you kill people) is not a typical reaction to alcohol.

The only exception to this is if you already knew that alcohol makes you go violent but you drank some anyway.

Strong violence is also not a typical reaction to cannabis (even strong doses), so *if* that guy's murder was truly caused by the cannabis and *if* he was truly unaware that cannabis would have that kind of reaction on him then all he can be considered guilty of is the consumption of cannabis.

5534,"*Chancellor Merkel has played a major role in ensuring that women in Germany are now at the forefront. That’s how it’s supposed to go on.*

The discomfort is discreetly concealed, but it cannot be ignored. Can they do that? Do they do that? Why did Chancellor Annegret make Kramp-Karrenbauer Minister of Defense? And does Ursula von der Leyen lift the giant task of Europe? The day after three women sat in Bellevue Castle and two of them walked off an honorary formation of the Bundeswehr, newspapers talk about ""adventure"". For the first time, male interpreters of the world say that the ""ladies"" must now create trust. Arrogance? To run away? Sure. But Germany's men just swim their skins off.

Angela Merkel has helped two confidants to key positions in a silent double-cross. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, so far a rather hapless CDU leader, will be given military command and authority in Germany. Ursula von der Leyen becomes head of Europe. It is certainly not a coincidence that the former GDR citizen Merkel encouraged two women to fill particularly difficult positions as a matter of course. Only there, in ""hard"" ministries, can women gain the recognition that is so stubbornly denied them in Germany. This applies to politics, journalism and all corners of society.

Behind the public astonishment at Merkel's ""coup"" in defence, however, is less the surprise that Kramp-Karrenbauer did not want to become a minister and has now changed her mind. That's a minor matter. In essence, it's not about the CDU presidency being incompatible with an important ministerial position. That is nonsense. Horst Seehofer, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Willy Brandt - they were all ministers and party leaders, not a soul was disturbed. The small difference: the sex.

The barely concealed skepticism, which is now particularly directed against Kramp cart builders, feeds itself from another source. Women like her leave - at last - the refuge into which they have allowed themselves to be enclosed for centuries by churches, husbands, their own conventions. They no longer fit into the West German image of morality, according to which motherhood, marital care, Caritas, should be incompatible with tons of responsibility for war and peace. And yes, after the first female ministers for family affairs, education and the environment in Germany, it is high time for a Federal Minister of the Interior and a Foreign Minister as well.

It is thanks to Angela Merkel, this self-declared non-feminist, that women now grow into political positions that correspond to her format. That will set a precedent. But elsewhere, too, there must be an end to false self-limitation. Women's quotas of 30 percent on company supervisory boards? Ridiculous. Every second top position has to go to women, whether they are EU commissioners, bankers or federal ministers.

For a lot of men, that means getting in line. A self-assured person like Jens Spahn will have to remain health minister for a while. In the future, male colleagues in companies will also have to take detours. That may hurt. Häme is out of place there. But Germany's women won't let themselves be sent back home any more.

Also the ""Just do something, now"" is only neccessary because parties all across the board were either ignorant or were bribed big timd by the fossil fuel industry for decades. 
Exxon for instance suppressed research that closely modelled the rise in average temperature we see today in the seventies.

In this light cutting down trees (that store carbon) for a coalmine (which dumps more carbon into the atmosphere) is a dangerously idiotic proposal. 

All those years of ignorance leave shitting money on it as the only viable solution.
As someone interested in it I can't say I agree with public opinion on nuclear, but by this point it  has fallen a bit behind because of undefunding and fearmongering.

5809,"No problem. I'm going to ignore a lot of the editorializing, particularly those bits regarding US  

&gt; ""Russian intelligence collection system"" what a load of absolute bullshit...Israel already flew over s400 radars multiple times.

So I'm not sure I would classify the S-400 as an ""intelligence collection platform"" (a term I've seen thrown around a lot), but in some ways it acts like one, vacuuming up all sorts of signatures and signals given off by the aircraft. Over time through repeated exposure of the F-35 to the S-400 vulnerabilities may develop which may make it easier to detect, identify, and track the F-35. It is also worth pointing out that the Israeli's reportedly fly with radar reflectors on the aircraft to better mask the RCS of the aircraft. Even without such reflectors as you would expect on a combat sortie, the concern isn't over incidental exposure of the F-35, but long-term frequent exposure.

I would be remiss if I didn't also touch on concerns regarding the integration of the F-35 into an IADS that also features the S-400 (a system that will be maintained by Russian technicians for the foreseeable future). One of the greatest strengths of the F-35 as advertised is its ability to perform as a ""quarterback"" (think creative #10) using its sensors and data-link to integrate with other aircraft and **ground based** systems. 

Simply put, the US is concerned Russian technicians when servicing the system will have access to sensitive information stored by the S-400 about the F-35.

&gt; If we have up the s400 they likely still would have found and excuse not to give us Patriots. 

Off the top of my head I think this is the 2nd or 3rd time we've offered the PAC-2 and PAC-3 to Turkey. Every time they have turned the US down, and in the most recent time the sale was even approved by Congress. Which given several amendments concerning arms transfers to Turkey, was a considerable hurdle to clear.

&gt; The f35 basically does spy on it's owners...if the US decides Turkey or any other country besides Israel and UK aren't allowed to use their F35 this basically means they can't

5924,"Discussing these issues with a Brexiter requires the suspension of all rules of logic

(a) Who has actually said that the elected officials have only a ""yeah"" or ""nay"" vote?  Every element of regulation has to go through the Council of Ministers and these guys have far more say than a single ""yeah"" of ""nay"".  In fact, under most conditions, ministers, including the British one, have a veto.  Furthermore, the EU Parliament has the power of the purse (they decide on budgets, etc), thus their power over the commission can be substantial (when they decided to collaborate).  But all of these are not important.  What is important is that Britain is a substantial member both of the bureaucracy and of the commission and has had important influence over the decisions of the EU.  Just to refresh your memory, it was the UK that championed the inclusion of the Eastern European countries in the EU.  It was the driving force.

(b) the bananas story is fake.  Get over it.  If you knock your head against the wall and make it work, you would understand why selling eggs by the kilo and not by the dozen is important for the common market.  I thought that this was self evident, but I guess that you cannot really depend on Brexiters to have any reasoning capability.  The same for most of the rest.  Regarding the VAT, it is how the EU is funding itself, dummy.  Most of the money goes back to member states.  In fact, the UK is the major recipient of regional development aid by the EU. 

(c) Listen all the rest is totally uninformed and, sorry to say, stupid.  Comparing the EU with USSR is totally ridiculous.  In addition, you do not know what you are talking about.  The UK does not participate in the Shengen treaty, so it has ""full control of its borders"".  In addition, based on EU legislation, it can evict any EU citizen that does not have a job in the country.  If the UK chooses not to enable control legislation, this is not the problem with the EU, it is with the UK government.  

(d) Well, I do not see any ""Brexit"" movements in any other EU country.  In fact, the pro-Euiropean sentiment has increased with all this Brexit discussion.  The only truth is that the deluded British feel bad if they are among 28 equals.  They just want to run the show and show to the rest of us how ""superior"" they are.  Racism, nativism and exceptionalism are the hallmarks of Brexit and you are a shining example of these.

In conclusion, a same approach to any problem would be to work to solve it.  The UK is (still) a key component of the EU and has a substantial influence in all levels of the Union.  In fact, it has an ""oversized"" voice.  If there are issues that need fixing, the British representatives can put them forward and one can have a reasoned discussion.  However, you and I know that this not what it is all about.  Portraying the EU, a democratic body in which your country participates at every level, as a horde of occupying Huns is nothing sort of ridiculous (considering also that several Commission Presidents were English).  In a club of 28 members one cannot have it his/her own way in all matters.  One would need to learn to compromise and work with the majority.  At the end, we are all stronger together.  Outside the EU, the UK would be an isolated, unimportant bit player which is not going to get much consideration by anybody.  And just wait: your ex-colonials are waiting around the corner to  inflict on you some really ""advantageous"" trade deals.  Because, as you know, the Indians and Chinese have such great ""love"" for the Brits.  Do you think that India and China have forgotten how you robbed them?  Do you think that the opium war is a feint memory?  Now you would be going to them with cup in hand!!!  Let's see what reception you would get!!!
