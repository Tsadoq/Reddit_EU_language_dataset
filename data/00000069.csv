47,"&gt;Sweden has massive problems with immigration, there's no denying that.

Immigration does not cause the crimes and the violence - much like Estonians migrating to Finland does not cause crimes any more than new Finns being born causes crime.

&gt;It's not just some circlejerk, it's proven by a variety of indicators, such as educational or employment numbers which, in case of immigrants, lags more heavily behind natives than in almost any other European country.

That's a completely different argument than the arguments displayed by the posters here- you're arguing about the factors that are actually relevant for criminality. But immigration itself does not cause these people to be stupider, less employed and so on - there are very complex factors that cause criminality, but immigration itself just brings in new people - and crime is caused by people. As I said - saying criminality is caused by immigration is like saying fucking and having children causes criminality.

&gt;I mean, seeing black youth attacking Swedish police because of an American case is just absurd.

Yeah no shit, it's absurd? What's your argument?

&gt;There's now not only religious terrorist attacks, but also racial tensions and violence stemming from it in Sweden

There's also gender tensions, there's ethnic tensions and so on and so on. All of these things can be solved and addressed.

&gt;Be honest, that's not the case in Latvia, and for a very clear reason.

Because we do not have enough black people to speak out and protest about the heinous racism in our country. The tensions and problems *exist, it's just less relevant here.* And the violence does not exist because our minorities are not as poor - violence would be a stupid outlet for their issues.

&gt;Can you really say it's all about ""inequality"" and ""social exclusion"" (because Latvia surely has a lot of both) or might there be something about some people's culture?

Culture *can be a factor*, but I am not stupid enough to say culture is the main factor - since that would mean Afghanis, Somalis etc. are unintegratable as groups altogether - but this is not the case.  Otherwise Estonians in Finland and Lavians in Brtain show how barbaric our cultures are through alcoholism and thievery - and Eastern European migrants should be banned.",Damn dirty sexy Balts..,/r/europe/comments/isb5r6/gang_violence_in_sweden_have_now_deteriorated_to/g57vo5n/,LatvianLion,1600080277

&gt;UNCLOS was actually not created on the principle of equity, that was introduced later in order to solve some problems like the ones you mentioned. But like i said you can't cherry-pick which parts of UNCLOS you like and which ones don't affect you cause you haven't signed it. Either you will follow the equity principle and seek a resolution like that and will also respect and sign the international law generally (remove your casus belli etc) or you get neither. 

UNCLOS part V is released as a whole. It introduced EEZ term and the article 59 in it explains how to solve conflicts, which arises when two EEZ collides with each other. It's not  cherry picking, pointing out the articles in UNCLOS, on which you base all your claims, it's calling bullshit out. Even if Turkey is not a signatory, it acknowledges the law. You are the one who ignores equity principle, in order to make your claims seen as just. Hell you have just tried to undermine the equity principle, a principle valid in the whole world, just because it's ""introduced later"". At least you make no attempts to cover up your inherent toxic bias that clouds your mind of rational thinking.

Any sane and rational man can see that islands such as Rhodes and Kastellerizo can't delimitate the mainland's projection of EEZ. The mainland's coast is thousands of kms long and it has MILLIONS more people living from that sea. It's the mainland's who got the priority on projection of EEZ, that's crystal clear. That's not a bias or anything, any third party at least educated himself on how these conflicts are solved, can reach this conclusion, but you can't.

197,"&gt;In Sweden there has been a complete refusal of even acknowledging that there is a problem. Public shaming, very real risk of losing your job and social circle if daring to discuss it in public.

I doubt anyone has created any statistics for this? It's annoying, because there is so little accessible data. Let me ask then: at what stage do you feel people would get into trouble?

For example, I stand by the German law that you cannot call for violence against an ethnic group (contrary to what idiots spread, Germany does not have hate speech laws in the American sense but laws against inciting *violence*).

Thus, in Germany you would rightly get into trouble for saying a version of ""I want someone/us to use violence against Group X"" but not for saying ""I do not want immigrants from Group X"". 

Labour laws apply to political expression as well, but I do not know who has the burden of proof (i.e. it could be hard to prove you got fired for voicing a controversial political position). If it's like anything else however, it won't be lopsided and usually involve several instances where you can challenge/take 'em to court.

Personally, I never seen or heard of anyone being tested for ideological conformity. For historical reasons, we have systems in place to prevent that.

&gt; I would even question if Swedish elections are truly free, you have to, in public, pick up voting cards for the parties you want to vote for in the voting booth. It's a very unique system and I am not sure a good one. People will feel shamed voting for the ""extreme right"".

You have to pick up the cards and people in your community can see which cards you picked? I'm not saying you are wrong, I just find it hard to believe because it is an obvious violation of having a secretive vote. That's frankly horrible.

&gt;I would agree Germany, and Denmark, has handled this a lot better, but still looong way to go.

Denmark seems to be the most assertive EU member state when it comes to assimilation. It will be interesting to see how that works out. I do not know if the level of assertiveness is required, but e.g. social housing to spread out immigrant population is necessary to have assimilation. I believe Austria is doing that, but I'm not sure.",EU nation: /r/acteuropa,/r/europe/comments/isb5r6/gang_violence_in_sweden_have_now_deteriorated_to/g57q5wy/,DFractalH,1600073766

206,"&gt;Turkish mainland has   
&gt;  
&gt;far  
&gt;  
&gt; better claim. Kastellerizo is a demilitarized, scarcely populated rock that in no way can exert an EEZ when it's 2km from the Turkish mainland

Neither of those things makes a good claim for Turkey. EEZ isn't determined by demilitarized status. As long as the island is there and it's populated, it gets EEZ. It doesn't matter how densely populated it is, otherwise places along the turkish coastline that don't have cities woul get no or reduced EEZ as well which is not the case.

&gt; Check out the ICJ rulings for similar cases, islands such as Kastellerizo are only given ter. waters and nothing more. 

The problem here is that a) those cases were ruled by the ICJ and Turkey doesn't seem to be willing to go to the ICJ. Also if im not mistaken Turkey has not recognized the ICJ's ruling on the matter in 1976 so unless those two things change and Turkey goes to court, you can't get a similar ruling. b) The cases aren't that similiar. Kastelorizo isn't a rogue island in the other side of the Atlantic, it's part of an island complex which also gets normal EEZ and Greece has thousands of islands (or hundreds of populated islands) so the outcome might not be the same. But still, even if it was to be the same, Turkey would have to pursue it in court which it doesn't want to do cause it's afraid of what else the court might decide. For example that Greece is allowed to extend the territorial waters to 12 n.m. Until then the law states that inhabited islands get normal EEZ just like the mainland.

If Turkey keeps shouting that the international law doesn't bind it because it hasn't signed it, then the same goes with the equity principle. You can't reap the benefits of UNCLOS without having signed it, and reject the parts that inconvenience you because you're not part of it.

215,"That's a partisan take. The most immigration-friendly and problem-averse party, Green party, was co-creating this situation all along, and has been a part of government since 2014. They also did not want to stop the flow of refugees back in 2015, always claiming that Sweden has unlimited capacity to take in refugees (on a permanent basis).

The second problem is that the Swedish job market is comparatively hard to enter. The government sets up pretend jobs from time to time, but those rarely lead to real jobs. Refugees have all kinds of backgrounds, a fairly big part of them have college degrees, but college degrees from the Middle-East are rarely accredited without extra work. Then there are a large number of people who can't read, or read very little in any language. These have an extraordinary hard time finding work in Sweden, a country that abolished work like gas station attendant many decades ago.

People who come here without means have two options, either they move where there's housing but nothing else, or they go live with their (extended) family in already crowded areas. The family network is great for many things, but it also slows integration and provides a perfect environment for family-based crime networks (or networks of religious extremists) to take hold. These neighbourhoods are fairly culturally isolated from the rest of Sweden, and many who live have little hope for the future apart from becoming successful career criminals, who are often the heroes of the neighbourhood. Even in death from shootouts with other criminals they are idolised.

That's my take. And I'm in the ""lets accept a reasonable number of refugees"" camp.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/isb5r6/gang_violence_in_sweden_have_now_deteriorated_to/g57iq88/,helm,1600065592

Sorry but I think you're just trying hard to distance yourself from the Balkans and trying to look more ""western"" European. I mean Croatia is a wonderful country as it is. I don't think you need to do that. It is true that northern Croatia has a stronger central European identity but if this is not a reason to kick Dalmatia out then I don't see why you have to disregard your similarities with Serbs.

Again, I am not saying you are exactly the same or anything. I just say that ""we are different"" doesn't sound right to me as a reason for the breakup of Yugoslavia.

And some areas of Croatia are very similar to parts of Bosnia and Serbia. Some areas, on the other hand, are not in the slightest. That's the problem of having a highly diverse country, there's a lot of debate where you belong.

What I know for myself, as well as my family and friends, is that we see ourselves Western, or Central European through and through. So is our lifestyle and outlook on life. Nothing can change that.

Let's say tomorrow the British Museum gives it back, what would then happen? Athens would demand other artefacts, in fact not just the Greeks but people all over the world. Two weeks and the entire museum is empty. There are of course many conflicts, who is the heir of Greek statues from India or Persian ones from Iraq?

To talk about some massive assimilation of Kurds, with the current policies of Turkish politics which are gonna most likely continue, is to me disingenuous at worst and wishful thinking at best. And, I know, you are gonna point out the religious identity that has served quite successfully as a unifier for certain Kurds to connect with Turkish majority more. 

But we are in a century of a dearth of religious identity, and I would gladly take a bet it is gonna matter a low less in 2050 then now. This is not accounting for that the same religious identity could be weaponized against Turkey or that in spite of this Kurdish social power inside Turkey has been on the rise vis a vis Turkish majority, obviously on the back of more favorable demographic conditions.

The UK wanted to start the talks straight after the vote.

But no.

The EU refused to open discussions about the divorce until article 50 was filed. OK fair enough. But then they also refused to discuss trade, in any fashion before brexit had been done.

Even though the whole divorce could have been made easier in doing so, because of course the divorce would have been easier if everyone knew what the future trade would be.

The whole 9 months of stalling because of the Ireland issue could have been avoided if both sides knew what the future trade would be like. Instead they had to guess their way though and come up with a divorce bill with one hand tied behind their back, and then try and battle through the trade negotiations after it was done.

450,"[They broke their own record of not having a government] (https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/124777/belgium-breaks-own-record-for-longest-period-without-government/)

The Belgian parliament didn't have any clear winners at the last election, no two parties have been able to form a coalition to creat a majority.  Hung parliament's, as they are named, aren't uncommon, however they rarely last as they tend to be loved by coalition or new elections. 

I'm not sure of the exact details of Belgium in particular but I'm assuming that the elected officials are still attending parliament and repping their people, but without a formed government there is no team in place to steer the country or present things for the parliamentary to debate. 

What does this mean for the country? Well the internal government workings are still being funded so admin is still working, taxes still getting collected, schools still being funded etc. The lack of government would affect the external presence a lot more, fortunatly, Belgium in its own is a small neutral country with little foreign intervention or policy. Additionally it's part of the EU, which bears the responsibility of a lot of its external interactions such as trade and the like.

So globally the effects are zero. And locally I'd assume the effect to be near zero. However you'd have to ask a Belgian for that. 

PS. Belgium is well worth s visit. With or without s government it is safe clean and very pretty.",,/r/europe/comments/irwmeg/other_countries_elect_their_presidents_in/g5734ko/,IrishMilo,1600053449

I respect your wish to have your identity as a separate nation but I really don't see why it would be impossible to keep a federation of constituent republics - you could always be a Croat and Yugoslavian at the same time similar to how the USSR worked.

Also given the history of your countries and cultures I personally see no reason to not see you guys as very very similar, honestly. Serbs, Croats, Bosnians... You are literally the people of same blood and culture who just went for different paths when it comes to religion. 

What is the difference between you and a Serb if you take nationalism and religion out? You essentially speak the same language having grown up in pretty much the same culture.

As the other poster stated, Yugoslavia was not any less feasible than some of the major nation-states today. Again, I perfectly understand why Croats don't want it for very understandable reasons.

Galileo GPS - this was the EU that kicked the UK (or threatened to) out and refused to pay back the ¬£1
4bn they invested in it. Petty intransigence from the EC surely isn't the UK's fault? And if anything this example underlines the reason why we left, and why the UK feels it will have more influence outside the bloc. The UK has repeatedly shown a willingness to stay involved in programs on a bi-lateral basis as long as it doesn't impede on its sovereignty as an independent nation.

It's also having your head in the sand pretending that there are many important common goals between the UK and a German dominated EU. The bar for major treaty change or progression gives German objectives a far greater importance than the UK's, as the former is more entrenched in the economic success of the rest of the union. Economically, monetarily and now politically.

Our geopolitics differ greatly. Germany is a regional power and the UK a second tier global power. France is both and it would have been a stretch at best to say the UK was a regional power in Europe pre-2016.

Turkey and Greece should go the international court already, and looking at other examples of EEZs (France-UK EEZ for example) it is highly unlikely Greece will get to keep it's maximalist claim if we do so.

739,"&gt; Gibraltar was seized after a war, under duress, by force of arms. Unless you're suggesting Spain would still have transferred it if the war hadn't occurred: and you'll forgive me if I'm skeptical of that.

Gibraltar was seized during a war - conquest - and then that was confirmed by the Treaty of Utrecht - cessation - in which it was part of a package of deals made and was confirmed as British, with the Spanish crown renouncing its claims to sovereignty over it. That is, by definition, not annexation. You not agreeing with it does not change the definition of the very specific term of annexation, and there's a very good reason why Gibraltar is referred to as being ceded whereas every source refers to the Crimea as being annexed.

&gt; In large part because the international community refuses to accept the possibility of a referendum. It's very rich to oppose a legitimate referendum and then to pretend you support the self-determination of peoples.

It would be if anyone was opposing a _legitimate_ referendum, but nobody is. If the referendum were legitimate it'd be accepted, but it's near-universally recognised as illegitimate. I find it quite amazing that anyone reasonably would be siding with the country that's currently engaged in direct human rights violations in the territory they've illegally occupied right now.

&gt; Yes, 1783-2020, with an interruption in 1945-2014 (and arguably only 1991-2014, since Ukraine still in union with Russia beforehand), is ""six years"". The math checks out.

The Russian Federation has been occupying Crimea for six years after annexing it in 2014. I fail to see how this can possibly be seen as incorrect. Either way, it absolutely hasn't been in control of the territory for 300 years as you said, that's just straight-up wrong.

&gt; What would it cost them to offer to hold a referendum arbitrated by a third party (say the UN)? Since the Crimean people want to rejoin Ukraine, obviously, if the referendum happens they win. If the referendum does not occur, Russia is outed for the imperialistic and hypocritical nation that it is. That they refuse to even consider the idea, even if only in rhetoric, says a lot.

These are things that can be offered when dealing with another nation in good faith. They cannot and should not be offered after an illegal undeclared war occupying an area of your country, because that would legitimise Russian actions whether the referendum passes or not. You don't negotiate with imperialist warmongers.

&gt; Yes, two exclaves taken through military force and retained by basis of self-determination, claimed by the nearby mainland neighbor for historical reasons which is using economic means to punish it for remaining tied to a foreign nation, are completely separate situations and absolutely parallels can be drawn between them. Seems legit.

Two exclaves. One taken illegitimately through military force in an undeclared war, the other ceded lawfully to another nation under a peace treaty in which they received compensation. That alone would be enough for it to be disqualified from serious consideration as a comparison made in good faith, were it not also for the other avalanche of complete dissimilarities I've gone over at length here.

(Sorry, this is an old discussion, I haven't been to reddit in a long time)

No, you obviously don't because you haven't had to spend thousands of euro on this kind of product, which is something essential if you want to live a normal life in modern society. It is VITAL for women to have access to feminine hygene products. And men have no idea how much money is spent on this out of necessity. I don't think there's any particular product catered to men alone which can be considered as essential, but if there was that product would obviously need to be low-tax or tax-free as well.

It's interesting because this has been an issue in places like [US prisons, where female prisoners aren't given enough personal hygene products to get by](https://www.publichealthpost.org/news/sanitary-products-women-state-prisons/), and sometimes even have to pay for them themselves, which is absurd, since you don't even have a proper income in there. 
In Europe those supplies are considered a human right. This should be enough to tell you how important they are - and how, fortunately, once again Europe is ahead on these matters.

You won't risk losing a job because you have sensitive teeth (that's the example we've been using). But you might if you break social norms and show up to work with your pants soaked in blood. You won't get shamed in the middle of the street/school/work because you have sensitive teeth. But you might if you can't afford to buy enough tampons or sanitary pads and end up having ""an accident"", or even risk an infection by not changing them enough times because you can't afford them. You can survive if you have sensitive teeth and can't afford special toothpaste, however it's pretty much impossible to go to work and pay your taxes if you're not wearing something to stop you from getting blood all over the place. It's enough that women who have severe cramps sometimes need to choose between enduring them (and some women feel them almost similarly to labour pains) or taking medication to funtion, even if that medication isn't tax-free (like other chronic pain medication).

If this is a matter of public health and safety, because you don't want to sit where a woman on her period was sitting if she isn't wearing protection, this is *definitely* the type of thing that needs to be treated like pharmaceutical drugs and have either a reduced tax (which I think makes more sense) or no tax at all (which I think is going a little too far).",,/r/europe/comments/gseg9f/where_the_tampon_tax_is_highest_lowest_in_europe/g557ww8/,idistaken,1600022713

You can move the goal post and pretend like you were only talking about trade deals in the comment I responded to, but they weren't even mentioned.  You said Pelosi's word is the law of the land which is patently false.  The president is the only one who has power resembling what you describe and that is via executive order... And Mitch McConnell has as much legislative power as Pelosi, which you apparently don't understand.

Furthermore regarding the elections, Trump is down in the polls less to Biden than he was to Clinton and we know how that worked for Clinton in 2016.  The incumbent president has a huge advantage and rarely loses.

850,"&gt;Ask the IMF if you don't understand why they classify you as a developing country.

Don't worry I wan't expecting more from you.

&gt; No they don't. They literally don't stand a chance and the Rafale are just much, much more advanced. Which is the exactly why Greece is getting them. F16 are outdated, there is no major nation with a capable military that uses them as their main fighter for a reason. You're decades behind on everything. 

LMAO! You must be kidding... Rafael's are LITERALLY in the same class with F16's... I mean won't even going to argue with you about the jets and military equipment after these literal idiotic claims... But let me inform you the only ""better"" thing if you can even accept that as the part of the jet is it's potential payload/ammunition AKA ""METEOR"" air-air missile if Greece gets those with the Rafael deal... Which even THOSE wouldn't change the balance but still better.

&gt; That's the ceiling of Turkey, manufacturing foreign technology since you can't develop your own... 

HAHAHA man this one is funny... Do you know how many sub/licensed systems RUSSIAN TANKS pay attention to here TANKS uses not even Jets which uses even more... Especially in electronics side... What gun does mighty US uses on it's might tanks ? ""foreign technology"" LOL... You somehow really believe that technology has a nationality huh :)

Turkey made and makes partnerships with MANY nations US, EU, KOREA ,JAPAN and many more... And they are accepted since it's MUTUALLY beneficial... NO ONE gives anything Turkey for their kindness mate... Many weapons programs in Europe has many OUTSOURCED parts... And not just that they are making PARTNERSHIPS to be able to make those weaponry... Germany, France, Italy, Spain, UK etc. But this is only a ""crime"" or a downgrading thing only if Turks do ? sure buddy.

&gt; It was ""advanced technology"" 30 or 40 years ago, again you're far behind advanced nations that developed and have been using their own for decades. 

Do you know anything about RADAR technology ? How much it's DIFFERENCE than it was 30-40 years ago ? mate... At this point you are just embarrassing yourself. IT'S A MULTI FUNCTIONAL PHASED ARRAY RADAR... 

That's like looking at to an ""I phone 12"" and calling it ""That's a phone, it's the technology of 100+ years ago.""

&gt; They are 100% German. They just sold you their old tech that you can manufacture and export to other third world nation since Germany is building and exporting much more advanced submarines. You really don't realise how all your examples are just perfect examples of your inferiority right? 

UMM ? They are Germany tech or more like WAS :) Which this was basically what Turkey was doing since 1970's JUMP STARTING all it's industries with technology transfers... That's why and how Turkey from %100 dependency in 1970's reached to %70+ indigenization in it's military... Also the first Type 214 was commissioned in 2007... I mean I don't know what is you ""old tech"" definition is but I can assure you in submarine lifetimes 2007 to present day is not what ""old tech"" is...Which like I said Turkey has literally changed ANYTHING she liked to... They even more MODERN versions of type 214's which is called type 214TN. 

And that's not my ""inferiority"" complex mate... LMAO it's just unintelligent fanatics like you who can't grasp the reality of they are living in 21st century now...

&gt; Man we blow you out of the water in every metric and Turkey's economy is completely collapsing, why would I be sad?

This is what Sami people are saying about a name (Lappland) that's been used historically as a marginalizing exonym against them.  If you ever decide to volunteer yourself to ask this question to Sami people, you'll have the opportunity to hear their perspective.  They are unhappy with what they describe as a recent history of forced sterilization of Sami by Sweden (just to focus on this area in particular), and that Sweden and Swedes allegedly act as if these events never happened.  They also say that young Swedes today can be quite racist against the Sami, and even that it's ""ironic"" that Sweden ""banks"" on a reputation of antiracism abroad, while not caring about Sami issues.

So it's not about ""strange"": It's about respecting the views of indigenous people.

Greek territorial waters thus cover 43.5 per cent of the Aegean Sea while Turkish territorial waters represent only 7.5 per cent. If the territorial waters of the two countries were brought to 12 n miles, 71.5 per cent of the Aegean Sea would be under Greek sovereignty and 8.7 per cent Turkish. The area of high sea would be reduced from 49 per cent to 19.7 per cent.

1009,"&gt;My personal opinion is that the Great Fire of Smyrna is too much intertwined with the Armenian genocide in Turkish public opinion.

The Greek Army pursued ethnic cleansing of Turks before this which is a major reason people deny the fire was in fact, started by Turks. They feel as if Turks were incapable of atrocities when atrocities were committed *against* them beforehand.

In any case, of course, Greeks torching and plundering Turkish villages isn't a justification for this but context is still important. It is kind of like Serbians and Bosniaks refusing to recognize their own atrocities while emphasizing atrocities committed against them.

But I really don't see why France's actions in Africa, the Middle East, etc. are relevant with regards to this very specific situation that involves Cyprus and Greece on one side and Turkey on the other. France isn't trying to colonise Greece, Cyprus or Turkey. 

France, as the EU's second largest member when it comes to economy and population as well as the biggest military within the EU, is, for all intents and purposes just helping out two other EU countries against a large non-EU country that is violeting the EEZ of one (Cyprus) and is actively threatening another (Greece). Seeing as violeting Cyprus' EEZ is pretty much violeting the EEZ of the EU itself, it's pretty accurate to say that France is defending the EU's EEZ from an external country (Turkey).

As for why France isn't just gifting Greece weapons as opposed to selling them weapons? Well, like all things weapons and other military gear/vehicles cost money to make and the workers still need to be paid to feed their families.

First and foremost, your rude and uncalled for comment that Alexander the Great would be disgusted at modern Greece is in itself disgusting. You are in no position to make such statements, especially when we can actually go back in history and see the events that lead to Alexander's ascension, his ""way"" of grouping all the hellenic tribes behind him, and his eventual fall. People in Greece, which I assume you've never been to and you don't have any actual experience with, doesn't look back with whistful melancholy, but with pride of what Greeks have achieved, and even after 400 years of terror under the Ottomans, Greeks survived, and thrived in the end.  


Secondly, being bailed out was the plan by the IMF and other European constitutions that now have come out and said it was one of the worst decisions they've made. Not for helping Greece, they wanted to, however they did it so wrongly because the bailouts was a bad move enforced and imposed on Greece. Not my words, IMF's.  


And lastly, I don't know where you're from, but I sincerely hope your countrymen aren't like you, because the name ""Macedonia"" has been in use, in Greece, for thousands of years, and to this day, Macedonia is the name of the region in Greece.

‚ÄúWe have to work until we are 67, if we even make that, they still try to raise it‚Äù
-	Yes obviously. An aging population with generous pensions (from the government) cannot be sustained if the working population is not really growing. Higher burden on each individual worker makes the system go boom. More of a demographic problem than a policy problem. 

‚ÄúLots of people lost their jobs and lots of companies are on the brink of collapsing‚Äù
-	false. The unemployment rate has barely increased. And yes, lots of companies are set to go bust without government intervention in these strange times. Except there is government intervention. 

‚ÄúBut still we have to donate billions into the eu because other countries who work until 50 are on the brink of collapse‚Äù
-	this is some FvD/PVV bullshit. First, in countries like Italy they work past their 50s and make more hours every week. Second, a major country collapsing within the EMU dunks all of EMU into crisis, especially if it is Italy. Stability of the EMU is crucial if we do not want to dump the Netherlands into a massive economic crisis. Third, the cost of this deal to give money to other nations was like half a billion annually because the Netherlands gets a bit more money and they are mostly loans. 

‚ÄúAre on the brink of collapse‚Äù
-	we‚Äôre very far from collapse.

Edit: I ought to add this interesting blurb by the president of the Dutch Central Bank, Klaas Knot. He says that not committing to the transfers that happened in July risks collapsing the Euro and puts the whole EU at risk. This is going to be super obvious, but a sudden collapse of the Euro would be absolutely catastrophic to the financial system (which includes everyone‚Äôs mortgages, savings, pension) and tears apart the monetary system that has been built up.

\- Increased territorial sea zone at Aegean sea from 3 miles to 12 miles by Greece!( Determined territorial sea zone at Aegean sea according to Lausanne (Lozan) 1923 treaty is 3 miles! )

Why 12 miles is a vital matter for Turkey ?Because, Turkey lose access of international waters due to some islands of Greece which are incredibly close to shores of Turkey.For instance, according to Sevilla map, a ship of Turkey which wants to travel from Istanbul to a city at south ( Antalya ) will have to have permission to use territorial sea of Greece!

1233,"&gt;be disgusted at modern Greece is in itself disgusting. You are in no position to make such statements, especially when we can actually go back in history and see the events that lead to Alexander's ascension, his ""way"" of grouping all the hellenic tribes behind him, and his eventual fall. People in Greece, which I assume you've never been to and you don't have any actual experience with, doesn't look back with whistful melancholy, but with pride of what Greeks have achieved, and even after 400 years of terror under the Ottomans, Greeks survived, and thrived in the end.

This is my point, Greek culture has changed from thousands of years of subjugation. The educated and leading pioneers of Alexander's time are gone, replaced by anger and instability.

If he were to come back to Greece today he might not even recognize the land he had been raised on.

&gt;Secondly, being bailed out was the plan by the IMF and other European constitutions that now have come out and said it was one of the worst decisions they've made. Not for helping Greece, they wanted to, however they did it so wrongly because the bailouts was a bad move enforced and imposed on Greece. Not my words, IMF's.

Bad financial policy was imposed on Greece?

&gt;And lastly, I don't know where you're from, but I sincerely hope your countrymen aren't like you, because the name ""Macedonia"" has been in use, in Greece, for thousands of years, and to this day, Macedonia is the name of the region in Greece.

So are you aware that North Macedonia was incorporated into Greece in the 4th century. If they want to call themselves Macedonia not only do they have a historical precedent, but Greeks should be minding their own business about how countries name themselves.",,/r/europe/comments/iru85y/erdoƒüan_warns_macron_dont_mess_with_turkey_france/g534823/,Thecynicalfascist,1599993865

1241,"The good friday agreement isn't all that relevant to the EU at large - it is purely for Ireland's sake, and their political capital is quite limited. The UK would be the party in breach of the treatment anyway, the US has a greater interest in that treaty as a signatory to it than we do. 

The real leverage is taxes. We are going to have a fully developed, first world nation state on our door with a top-of-the-line financial system, that will be exclusively geared toward tax evasion in Europe. If necessary, they can and will do so (with relative ease) under WTO rules. You'll find that even EU rules had an extremely hard time addressing this issue, despite it being perpetrated by a minority of states with insignificant population totals. 

The UK is threatening the EU that it will cripple their tax base. It will redesign their economy for maximized effect if required, which isn't hard given their starting point. The EU still has no response to this beyond calling the bluff; which is part of why Barnier and the EU are going so hard in these negotiations, and in large part why there's been such a spectacular effort to make the UK look bad in public. Or did you think it was an accident that the EU's formal demand to have a deciding vote on all future UK legislation being made a week prior to Boris' proposal to withdraw was not covered at all, nor is it still? We asked them to submit to colonisation, yet the news isn't touching that with a ten foot pole - it's just highlighting the UK's response and calling them childish for it. The discussion is being bent in order to get more public pressure on the UK government. It's happening here, and it's happening everywhere. We're all eager to go with it, because it's easy and comfortable to blame the UK for their incompetence, rather than question our own failing - both in moral terms and in competence.",,/r/europe/comments/irtab2/from_todays_dutch_newspaper_nrc/g534ch6/,Lekmigunmaasj,1599993919

1313,"&gt; Whats that supposed to mean? 

Well, Southern Europe has tended to inflate its way out of problems with debt. This approach to clearing debt first appeared naturally, for example after WW1. But in time, international creditors have become increasingly adept at attaching strings to loans. So if Spain would use the peseta and try to issue debt it would have two potential problems:

\- poor loan terms, as interest rates would likely price in risks upon leaving the Euro

\- foreign currency loans, which would be difficult to pay back if inflation rose

For the former, we have numerous examples, but the best is Argentina, which shows the power that creditors now have vis-a-vis states. For the second case, the best example is Turkey which had the bad idea of issuing debt in Euros/USD while having a fairly high inflation in the domestic currency. Nominally low interest rates have been cancelled out (and then some) by the falling value of the lira and with loans having state guarantees, Turkey is struggling to pay back.",,/r/europe/comments/irtz5l/the_euro/g52mryj/,Robi_damian,1599986667

The EC can block Hungarian commissioners to participate.

The EP can walk away whenever one of those fascist fucks talks.

The EU could stop sending money to countries that defy EU values.

The EC can bring Hungary and Poland to court, for breaking EU laws and values (Article 2, look it up).

The EU could do much more than that.

&gt;EDIT: So IMHO this is just a coward copout to not seem homophobic. 

That's a nice story, but with all due respect, it's also utterly bullshit for most of the countries concerned.

While I'm personally rather opposed to such restrictions, those policies are actually grounded in scientific data: in France, bisexual and homosexual males are statistically [200 times more exposed](https://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/don-du-sang-pourquoi-le-gouvernement-maintient-une-periode-dabstinence-pour-les-homosexuels-3910336) to the HIV, and [nearly half of the identified cases](https://vih.org/20171129/le-vih-en-france-en-2017/) are found within those categories.

Blood is tested, but because tests are not infallible, the rationale is to try to limit as much as possible accidental contaminations by filtering out potential contaminated donors beforehand -- that also includes syringe-based drug users and a couple more categories.

It's a prophylactic measure, it may be controversial for societal reasons, but it does save lives -- which is the whole point of blood donations in the first place.

&amp;nbsp;

So before going down the outrage route, try to first look up what is *actually* going on, because emotion-based opinions are the worst counsel when it comes to these matters.",France,/r/europe/comments/irhba3/blood_donation_restrictions_on_men_who_have_sex/g52806t/,Orravan_O,1599980867

Now most of the homes are lived in year around.  One of my neighbors died of a heart attack because the address for his house is a street that no longer exists and runs thru multiple private yards.  The computer system just had data uploaded from the legal documents laying out the area. It did not show the informal road that actually led to his house and he died. 

Looking at that picture, I have to imagine this causes needless confusion.  Particularly a lot of those lines likely date back centuries when things were different.

Greece had more help from New Zealand who were legendary in several campaigns, including the battle of thermopylae.

Greeks Delayed the NAzis into the russian Winter...

Then the two sociopaths of hitler and Stalin faced off in Stalingrad.

Not a fan of the soviets.. And they also killed millions.. But essentially, its the russians that did the most against Hitler.

America frankly speaking, had a good campaign under General S. Patton in Africa. They were basically losing and getting embarrassed, in every other exchange.

But dont forget in Africa, it was again Australians, and South Africans that were incredible, in holding off the italians and then the Nazis too. Honestly everyone pretends like Italy wasnt a force.. They were a bigger deal than Japan. But the italians took the hardest campaigns. Could not blitzkrieg greece, and Africa was an utter disaster too. Some of the greatest military men in history fought there in Africa. The South African force was also unrivaled man for man.

America takes way too much credit. American dominance comes actually after world war 2.. And its contribution is mostly dealing with the soviets. The Cold war, and the communist threat.

People dont give the russians credit either, because of how sadistic stalin and the communist regime was. But they certainly did the heavy lifting in ww2. So did Greece.

Then ofcourse the British Empire, supported campaigns across the world effectively. Without the empire where the sun never sets, WW2 would have been impossible in logistics and supprt. India also supplied thousands of troops too, through the british empire.

Ask the IMF if you don't understand why they classify you as a developing country.

&gt; f16's are literally the same things with Rafael's and NOWHERE near being outdated...

No they don't. They literally don't stand a chance and the Rafale are just much, much more advanced. Which is the exactly why Greece is getting them. F16 are outdated, there is no major nation with a capable military that uses them as their main fighter for a reason. You're decades behind on everything.

&gt; Also Turkey actually produced 40 or something f16's for EGYPT when Egypt made a deal with US for them and also Turkey was(still is somehow LOL) production partner of F35 project... In fact US STILL in almost 2021 couldn't cancel Turkey's involvement in production since they were not able to find good enough solution to that pretty huge contribution of Turkey...

That's the ceiling of Turkey, manufacturing foreign technology
since you can't develop your own...

&gt; And for example this do you think radar systems like these are not ""advanced technology"" if it's not I don't even know what is...

It was ""advanced technology"" 30 or 40 years ago, again you're far behind advanced nations that developed and have been using their own for decades. 

&gt; Submarines yes German but aren't quite German... The new ones that getting build, 6 type 214TN's I mean that Turkey is producing are getting build by TURKISH shipyards under license WITH localized part...

They are 100% German. They just sold you their old tech that you can manufacture and export to other third world nation since Germany is building and exporting much more advanced submarines. You really don't realise how all your examples are just perfect examples of your inferiority right?

It looks like some ammunition -- guided ammunition -- was built, but that the Zumwalt class was not deemed satisfactory for the naval fire support (shelling things on land) role.  All but three of the ships in the class were cancelled, and the remaining ships were repurposed for surface warfare.  They do carry a large number of missiles and a smaller pair of guns, which they can use in a surface warfare role.  The guided rounds intended for the naval fire support role were no longer built as the class wasn't expected to be used in a fire support role.

1650,"From what limited footage is there, whichever cop(s) initially started bashing the car with nightsticks for God knows what reason in the first place when it was just stopped were probably acting wrongly.  Even if the car wasn't supposed to be there -- and if it wasn't, I can only imagine that they screwed up blocking off traffic -- the idea that they wouldn't just order the guy out of the car seems pretty bizarre.

I also have to say that the whole concept of hitting a guy in a vehicle with a nightstick when there are other cops in front of him seems like a really bad idea, since it's not gonna disable him or the vehicle.

However, when Cop #15 sees a car cruising at increasing speed through a crowd of cops with 14 other cops clubbing the thing it, he's going to make the (not unreasonable) assumption that they're doing so for a good reason.

And while I think I can understand *why* the driver's response was what it was -- he didn't want the car to be destroyed, and his only way out was to drive into the only apparently-open area to escape -- he wound up gunning his engine and driving straight at a bunch of cops entering the area, which from their standpoint is gonna look like a threat.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/irgtie/stop_guys_stop_dramatic_video_shows_driver/g517f3k/,duisThias,1599967366

1) I have no idea why you bring up the Bible. I never mentioned the Bible. I don't understand your logic.
2) If this book said ""I hate all women"", I would have the exact same position. (Unless it is meant ironically and is satire, but here it very much isnt. It's pure hatred towards one gender and that is simply not okay). 
3) Since you insist on talking about the Bible and seem to compare the book written by this horrible woman, to the Bible,  then I'd say  the Bible does not have the title ""we, in this book, all hate women"".  That is not what the book is about.   I agree with you that it depicts women negatively, but that is to be taken in the context of it being written centuries ago, when it was the norm. One cannot apply 21 st century morals to ancient texts. One must see the world through their eyes and not judge based on our modern values. We can say slavery is wrong today, but we can't say all people doing slavery 1000 years ago were bad. Just like pedophilia is wrong today, but in ancient greece it was normal. Does that mean those ancient Greeks were bad? No it doesn't.   So, same logic with the Bible and whatever ancient literature. 

In simple terms, they have an excuse. But she does not. Because she lives in the 21st century and the societal norms of today are : sexism and generalizations and hatred are not okay.

Sept. 12 (UPI) -- Police arrested more  than 200 people and fired tear gas in Paris Saturday during the first  Yellow Vest demonstrations since mid-March.

The last Gilet Jaunes protest [happened](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-more-than-150-arrested-during-first-yellow-vest-protest-since-france-lockdown-lifted-12069788) [on March 14](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/03/16/Yellow-Vest-protest-turns-violent-in-Paris/9851552752582/), three days before France went into lockdown due to the novel coronavirus.

Officers fired tear gas at demonstrators along the Avenue de Wagram  in Paris while another protest took place near the capital's stock  exchange. Other demonstrations took place throughout the country.

Police had banned demonstrations from spreading the Champs Elysees after demonstrators defaced the [Arc de Triomphe](https://www.upi.com/topic/Arc_de_Triomphe/) monument during an earlier Yellow Vest demonstration.

[Police said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/12/europe/yellow-vest-france-protests-intl/index.html) they took more than 250 people in for questioning and issued warnings to 90 others as of 6:20 p.m. local time.

People associated with the Yellow Vest movement had planned four  demonstrations on Saturday but police said Friday that they had banned  two.

The movement started in November 2018 and takes its name from the  yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists carry in their vehicles.

Early protests opposed attempts to increase fuel prices and in its  first year, the movement resulted in an $11.05 billion aid package for  the poor.",,/r/europe/comments/iroj0r/police_arrest_250_demonstrators_at_first_yellow/g50dxak/,BonusFacta,1599958070

Turkey‚Äôs biggest weakness is itself. Ofcourse the solution if turkey attacks Europe is to divide into several states, and end the Turkish dream of world domination.

So yes organisations and freedom fighters like pkk will be armed by Europe if turkey starts a war. 

Most of the fighting will be european support for internal factions in turkey. 

A euro-Turkish war will end up being a Turkish civil war in the end.
That I can guarantee. 

Turkey can not take Europe. It can‚Äôt even take on Greece... Greece knew straight away not to just call on european allies - but also Egypt Saudi - and I guarantee you they have already spoken pkk and other factions they will utilise to fight any possible war with turkey..

Giant peninsula wanted to be blocked from 2 sea border lines West &amp; South !Two main conflicts it has vitally important for Turkey and it's armn and people are ready to war for its rights!

1. Territorial sea borders of Greece wanted be enlarged from 3 miles ( against 1923 Lozan treaty) to 12 miles which kill the international water access of Turkey and even it's ceasing its domestic sea lines : imagine that, One ship can't travel from Istanbul to another city of Turkey at south Antalya ..   
Naturally, this country will be ready to war for its freedom !!! Don't you war for the freedom of your country?!   

2. Meiss (Kastellorizo) -- 10 km square -- island can't be counted as a mainland and drawn sea-borders over it by bypassing a huge country marine border rights with a piece of rock ..

Look at that map! Even you can't see that Meis / Kastellorizo  Island!   
Giving 40.000 km2 stack of sea to 10 km2  an island ( Meis /  Kastellorizo )  and this island is in the territorial water zone of Turkey which is just 2 km far the shore of mainland of Turkey annd Turkey has the longest shore of Mediterranean sea .. ?  
What a justice it is man! huhh!   
Did proportionate laws evaporate from the earth ?!      
Is it a logical comparison, proportion ?!  
Does it sound logical ?!  
What your eys tell you when you look to the map! Please be honest !?  


Malta is an Island country right!   
Look at its EEZ fields between its sea neighbors ?!   
That island is not in an territorial sea zone of any other country and it gets sea zones in a proportion between its sea neighbors ...  It does not steal all sea fields for its self like Greece does ove Meis Island can be counted as only a town!   
The Marine borders of Turkey is not the issue of Erdogan!It is beyond Erdogan!People of Turkey are putting their weight on this issue by the guidance of academicians and admirals !Erdogan is our stuff! He is not a sultan and none can be a sultan again!Don't blackmail Turkey and gather supporters by using the fear of Ottoman of Europeans ..

Please guys look at the map!!isn't something wrong with it ?While Italy and Greece put the sea border line in the middle of their mainlands without counting islands of Greece. If they count her Islands as mainland, Greece must have a bigger EEZ .

In this case, they push Turkey like a colonialist imperialist power!People of Turks continue to resist ! And this pressure makes them united again like in the past! You will see the resistance of Turks! how long will last and who will lose more ! Don't play with this nation..! Nobody wants a war but Turks will not step back from the fronts... Will you too ?! Please be honest ! and look at that you'll understand how idiotic pressure is getting applied on Turkey!

If this map is applied, the right of access to international waters of Turkey evaporates!Really, will Turks have to ask Greece to let us access international waters for going from Istanbul to Antalya ( from North of Turkey to South of Turkey )Imagine that, Our ships can't go from city to city without a permission of Greece !!!

&gt;Worldwide, more than 80 percent of all adult HIV infections have resulted from heterosexual intercourse.(1)  
&gt;  
&gt;Of new infections among men in the United States, CDC estimates that approximately 60 percent of men were infected through homosexual sex, 25 percent through injection drug use, and 15 percent through heterosexual sex. Of newly infected men, approximately 50 percent are black, 30 percent are white, 20 percent are Hispanic, and a small percentage are members of other racial/ethnic groups.(4)  
&gt;  
&gt;Of new infections among women in the United States, CDC estimates that approximately 75 percent of women were infected through heterosexual sex and 25 percent through injection drug use. Of newly infected women, approximately 64 percent are black, 18 percent are white, 18 percent are Hispanic, and a small percentage are members of other racial/ethnic groups.(4)

50 % you say? I mean even the circa 1% gay men population number is probably wildly inaccurate.  

&gt;As of the end of 2001, an estimated 40 million people worldwide ¬ø 37.1 million adults and 3.0 million children younger than 15 years ¬ø were living with HIV/AIDS. More than 70 percent of these people (28.5 million) live in Sub-Saharan Africa; another 14 percent (5.6 million) live in South and Southeast Asia.(1)  
&gt;  
&gt;Worldwide, approximately one in every 100 adults aged 15 to 49 is HIV-infected. In Sub-Saharan Africa, about 9 percent of all adults in this age group are HIV-infected. In 12 African countries, the prevalence of HIV infection among adults aged 15 to 49 exceeds 10 percent.(1)  
&gt;  
&gt;Approximately 50 percent of adults living with HIV/AIDS worldwide are women.(1)  
&gt;  
&gt;An estimated 5 million new HIV infections occurred worldwide during 2001; that is, about 14,000 infections each day. More than 95 percent of these new infections occurred in developing countries.(1)

There were very few parking spaces close to or in the town and they were all full, with the only space available being at a parking place 2km down the road on the other side. At least there you could pay extra for a shuttle bus in stead of again having to walk 2kms down a dangerous narrow road. We ended up turning around and going back.

1914,"&gt; How according to you this ""overextenstion"" actually works?

If it takes 30 days for you to send a message to a province and 30 days for the reply to come back than that province is effectively independent, and resources spent on trying to keep that province under your rule often times outweighs the benefits in keeping that province. For all of the conflicts you counted this was the case. The empire gained very little from keeping those provinces other than general prestige, and often times wars waged to keep those provinces damaged the treasury and economy in ways keeping those provinces could not recuperate. 

&gt;And no historians actually are distancing themselves now from the whole ""rise and decline"" narrative towards more nuanced approach

The first part is through but second part is not. General gist of arguments against decline theory is that around the end of 16th and start of 17th century the Empire failed to achieve the military victories it did in previous years and faced economical difficulties as the state was organized in a way that facilitated war with an economy that was geared specifically towards it. After the period of crisis and stagnation the state transformed itself into a more stable system that focused more on effective governance of the areas under direct rule and effect tax collection in those region.

And the push against decline theory does not extend to 18th century, where most would agree Empire was definitely behind European powers.",Byzantine Empire,/r/europe/comments/ir8m7q/on_this_day_in_1683_coalition_of_catholic_nations/g4z6r97/,Webemperor,1599943620

Edit: wow this kinda blew up , so here I present you more Chinese facts to you fellow European friends (do I count as European ? I m half English) 

Interesting enough, in China, European culture and stuffs are among some of the most praised. Swedish milks, Norway fish , French bakery, German tools , anythings tag with European countries in China have 80% chance become popular products on a store shelf and have 100% chance of double even triple the price Tag. In most Chinese mind , Europe is often associated with royalty and delicate craftsmanship. Yes, German engineering meme very much applied in Chinese market . I have seen tools on TaoBao (Domestic Version of aliexpress) specifically want to associate themselves with German products and are made in Germany . Moreover, universities in those more developed European nations  (Germany, Switzerland) are very popular in Chinese student community too .

Edit 2: wow seems people are really interested, so here are more Chinese facts about Europe but from student‚Äôs perspective( hear from my Chinese friend in uk, Milan, Berlin ). Most of the young Chinese actually really I mean seriously REALLY respect European and their cultural and technological achievements. I know some of the students in China , even in high school, dreams to work in facilities like CERN(kinda my dream too , my friend got a internship there) and work in companies like Zeiss and airbus(another friend got internship in Toulouse). Also, most of the art student dream to study art in place like Rome and Milan. 

Another facts is a typical European figure in Chinese mind is tall, blonde, have blue eyes, smart, wear fashionable dresses and speak like 3-4 languages. I think they kinda affect by tv shows like Sherlock Holmes, Babylon Berlin, 007 etc.

Yes exactly, that you have some very rich regions and some very poor ones. A point you seemed to suggest was a negative when assessing the EU.

&gt; No it isn't. No other nation is required to.

Maybe not exactly in this way, but this is only because the UK has rejected the level of integration that Norway or Switzerland has with the EU, so a different solution is required.

&gt; If the cost of doing business in the UK is low enough the fact there are tariffs doesn't matter.

I'd argue that if the UK was to cut standards to the point where it's 20% cheaper to produce there than in say Slovakia, then mitigating that with a 10% import duty is a rather big deal rather than irrelevant..

2161,"Where did I justify breaking it up? The discussion started with you saying to just stop using Facebook and me saying it is not that simple. We are not discussing any justifications for a break up or ban. But if you want to go into that direction, a break up of Facebook could be done mostly on the basis of their position right now being anticompetitive in the social media space by their purchases of Instagram and Whatsapp (and Facebook lied to the EU when purchasing this one about data consolidation, which they only got a small fine for afterwards). But again, that is a different discussion from the one we were having.

&gt;it's a private company.  
&gt;  
&gt;when I mentioned freedom of speech, I was talking about misinformation in general,  
&gt;  
&gt;remove facebook and misinformation wont die with it, misinformation exists on all social media platforms and forums, news sites, local newspapers, basically anywhere you can comment and journalists aren't immune to it either, like on reddit, do you think reddit also should be shut down to counter misinformation? drawing the line is difficult, that's the thought behind free speech.

I never said misinformation will die with it. Of course it exists everywhere, but Facebook at the moment is very important platform used to spread it more. And they on purpose neglected to handle this because it would hold back their growth numbers. Just when the investigations started into this after the 2016 election, they shut down the major flaw being used for setting up and spreading fake news through Facebook. Everybody focused on the ads back then, but Facebook looking away from the security holes in their like and follow widgets were way more important and used massively in the spread of this stuff. They knew. They didn't do anything.

The problem with Facebook right now is they want to both ways. They want to function as both a publisher - which is responsible for the content they publish - and as infrastructure that can say they are only the tool, and not the one producing the content. That is impossible. Either they need to be the infrastructure and open up their platform more and be hands off, or they need to take more control and take responsibility for what happens on it. If I own a tv station and I give someone air time, and they use that to spread calls for violence, hate speech and more, can I just go ""well, not my program, I just own the tv station""? No. A decision was made to allow it on the station. Same with Facebook.

&gt;an oil spill is intentional, what happened in Myanmar wasn't.

An oil spill can also be not intentional, yet we still hold the company responsible for it accountable. If the oil company knew their infrastructure was flawed and that could very well lead to that oil spill, they are responsible. Same with Facebook. They on purpose enter markets where they know they can't control what happens on their platform, and they let the situation get worse for years and years and then go ""well, how could I have known?"" But they knew. They were warned. They were shown the problem. They didn't do anything. Neglect is also a thing and a company should be held accountable for it.

It never stops to amaze me how people can just handwave away the problems a company making billions upon billions in profit creates as if that ir perfectly normal and acceptable.",,/r/europe/comments/iraht4/should_the_eu_do_with_facebook_like_the_us_is/g4y4b3b/,cissoniuss,1599930006

2183,"I went to Milan last summer, can definitely say it‚Äôs very touristy but there‚Äôs a significant lack of things to do after you‚Äôve exhausted the main sites in the vicinity of the cathedral. One thing that really put me off, however, was how much I got the impression the city did NOT like tourists. Every restaurant we went to had a mix of foreigners and Italians, and it was painfully obvious that the staff was neglecting the former for the latter, sometimes to a painfully obvious degree. All the tourists were looking at each other really awkwardly as they waited forever for acknowledgement while the Italians were getting waited on immediately. Again, I can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs necessarily wrong or anything to prioritize your people, but it was different from any other European city I‚Äôve been to and realized Milan wasn‚Äôt open to tourists yet - unless you have tons of money, or course.

THAT BEING SAID, if you want to visit Milan, you want to spend the MAJORITY of your time outside the city, particularly by Lake Como. The biggest mistake we made was setting our base in Milan and not by Lake Como. The area is stunningly beautiful, one of the most breathtaking places I‚Äôve ever seen.

2233,"Again, where did I say laws were being broken? You are trying to have a different discussion from the one we are having. I never said they broke any laws.

We are talking about the damage done by Facebook, and that us as individuals stop using it does not have the impact needed to stop that damage. Damage like that misinformation and even worse like I have pointed out.

Facebook does not just give the tools though. They also set the rules. If they would just provide the tools, then why do they even have guidelines for what you can and can't say on the platform? You can get banned for a lot of reasons. So is that then not part of that freedom of speech? Apparently not, because Facebook dictates what you can publish on their platform. So they don't just see themselves as such tools, but as a party that can define the speech allowed. But when there is then criticism on their application of those rules, it is suddenly freedom of speech? So which is it? Because you can't have it both ways.

I just pointed out actual genocide, which you for some reason ignore. But OK, back to the data targeting. Facebook allowed companies to gather a ton of data from their users without oversight. Which was then used for microtargeting scenarios to influence people to certain political leanings. This kind of targeting is dangerous, because it means that those people get a message specifically shaped for them and not the other information also needed to form an actual opinion on the subject. That undermines our democracy. And you know... the actual genocide that was being done with the help from Facebook as a platform due to misinformation and targeting on groups who are influenced by that.",,/r/europe/comments/iraht4/should_the_eu_do_with_facebook_like_the_us_is/g4xmrg5/,cissoniuss,1599922226

There appear to be 800k people with liquidator status, which grants social benefits. Now eastern europe is extremely corrupt, and I don't know what to really think about this number. Also the rest of the article tells about number of deaths and some statistics after some years, but does not relate to expected deaths under normal condition and such.

2418,"I‚Äôm from a town near Venice. Around the same size of Monza for comparison. 

The problem with Milan is that having a good life in Milan requires too much money. 

Students rightfully enjoy Milan because the parents are typically the ones paying the rent so they get to enjoy living in one of the few truly metropolitan cities in Italy. 

Workers that do live in Milan are however a minority. Because living in Milan just costs too much. Milan is in the top 5 most expensive cities in Europe for average salary/cost of living ratio. 

As a programmer, the average salary in Milan is 1500. Typically 1250 for a junior. 1750/1900 for a senior. In a town where a shitty one bedroom apartment costs 600 euros, on top of which you need to add all the expenses. So you end up spending around 130 in bills, 150/200 (so let‚Äôs say 175) for food and let‚Äôs say an extra 100 for general expenses you may have during the month. This leaves us with a grand total of ~1000 euros spent just to sustain yourself. The other 500 is all that‚Äôs left. So unless you live like I do (no friends here since I moved so I never go out on weekends meaning that I only spend money in cigarettes and one/two games per month) you‚Äôll barely save any money if you actually have a normal social life. 

So that forces you looking for a home outside Milan. However, the hinterland still costs too much. You could go in a god forsaken town like Gorgonzola and the prices are still too high because the metro passes through there. 

This usually leaves you with 2 options: either you go to a god forsaken town where there is no metro (so your commute to work will take over 1 hour and a half) or you check a Monza and Pavia. Commute to work from Pavia is not that great, but doable. And the town is nice. Commute from Monza is more doable, but monza is a town of rich people. With expensive rents. 

All in all, either you live IN Milan but you barely get to save a penny, or you go outside Milan, but you‚Äôre still going to spend a large chunk of your earnings and you have to deal with a long commute. 

For the record, the estimated earnings required to live a good life in Milan is between 2200 and 2400. 

In a town where a programmer gets 1500.

For example, we could define a set of circumstances under which an independence referendum is automatically granted, and the result automatically respected by all the members, and automatically making the new state an EU member. There are no ""international laws or norms"" that can prevent a group of sovereign states from entering into such an agreement. That's why I don't see the relevance of your objections.

News flash, Free Trade Agreements do NOT massively move the macroeconomic needle, none of them. That's why,

- From the UK's perspective, the downsides to a no-deal at the end of the negotiations aren't that great since what's on the table is a barebones FTA

And yet this did nothing to stop this sub (and others) wanking itself silly when the Canada-EU trade deal was agreed despite the fact that analysis on both sides concluded that the benefits to GDP would be on a similar order to this Japan-UK deal.

&gt; press release are not new benefits relative to the status quo. They are loses avoided by agreeing a UK-Japan deal to replace the EU-Japan FTA""

That's only partly true. He even says that the deal is a 'roll over' for *most substantive purposes*. Weasel words if ever I saw them. What Japan and the UK did here was to take the EU-Japan deal as a template. They added some small tweaks to take into account their respective bilateral interests. These aren't huge, but they aren't nothing either. Remember, to avoid not having a deal they needed something agreed by October. This deal is important as it provides continuity and they can always improve on and further embellish it later. 

Sampson's claim that there are 'no new benefits to the status quo' is simply wrong, it's a lie. If the UK was staying in the EU, we'd have the EU's trade deal with Japan which is *almost* the same as the UK-Japan trade deal under discussion here, but slightly inferior. They are not identical in every respect.

2620,"&gt;How is a pint anything other than a pint?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pint

&gt;The British imperial pint is about ‚Äã1‚ÅÑ5 larger than the American pint because the two systems are defined differently.

-

&gt; Since the majority of countries in the world no longer use American or British imperial units, and most are non-English speaking, a ""pint of beer"" served in a tavern outside the United Kingdom and the United States may be measured by other standards. In Commonwealth countries it may be a British imperial pint of 568 ml, in countries serving large numbers of American tourists it might be a US liquid pint of 473 ml, in many metric countries it is a half-litre of 500 ml, or in some places it is another measure reflecting national and local laws and customs.[5]

-

&gt; Legislation in the UK mandates the use of the pint as a measure for draught beer and cider (in pubs for instance).[20][21] UK legislation mandates that draught beer and cider may be sold by the imperial pint, and in public houses can only be sold in a third of a pint, two thirds of a pint or multiples of half a pint, which must be served in stamped, measured glasses or from government-stamped meters.

-

&gt;However, the ""pint glass"" in pubs in Australia remains closer to the standard imperial pint, at 570 ml. It holds about 500 ml of beer and about 70 ml of froth, except in South Australia, where a pint is served in a 425 ml glass and a 570 ml glass is called an ""imperial pint"". In New Zealand, there is no longer any legal requirement for beer to be served in standard measures: in pubs, the largest size of glass, which is referred to as a pint, varies, but usually contains 425 ml.[23]

-

&gt;In Canada, the ""pint of beer"" served in pubs and bars has long been considered a colloquial term for ""a large glass of beer"". Legally speaking, after 1873, it was defined as one British imperial pint of 20 imperial ounces. On the other hand, the United States continued to use a smaller 16-imperial-ounce pint,[citation needed] while in French Canada after 1873 a ""pinte de bi√®re"" was defined as a much larger 40-ounce quart of beer, so confusion arose to which was being used. Prior to 1961, bottled beer in Canada was served in two sizes, colloquially known as ""quarts"" and ""pints"". They were 22 and 12 imperial ounces (625 and 341 ml), respectively, which were much smaller than the British units.[citation needed] Some provinces banned the sale of beer in the larger bottle. For example, in Ontario in the 1950s only the smaller size could be sold, but in Quebec both sizes were about equally common. The numerous incompatibilities between traditional Canadian, British, French, and American unit systems was one of the driving forces behind metrication in Canada. 

-

&gt;A 375 ml bottle of liquor in the US and the Canadian maritime provinces is sometimes referred to as a ""pint"" and a 200 ml bottle is called a ""half-pint"", harking back to the days when liquor came in US pints, fifths, quarts, and half-gallons.[28] Liquor in the US has been sold in metric-sized bottles since 1980 although beer is still sold in US traditional units.[29]",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/iqldl3/edinburgh_in_mid_july_oc/g4wq8ma/,duisThias,1599893701

2642,"&gt; ""I support independence because I'm superior than the rest of the Spanish citizens""

Man, nobody is gonna say this, it's too much on your face. Let me tell you more how it works, and it's a much more subtle thought. I know because I'm Catalan, with Catalan as mother tongue, from a small village, and middle class Catalan family.

The main idea here in the minds of nationalists is ""we deserve to have independence, because of democracy and right to self determination"". Now, this looks like a perfectly valid and even virtuous thought, which it is by itself. But the underlying motivation is plain and simple supremacism.

Then you ask ""Alright, why do you think we have the right to independence?"" and the answer will be something like ""Because we are a nation, we have our own language and culture, our own history, because we are *different*"". Here you start seeing the underlying motivation, because are we really that different? We are different also from Italians but that doesn't stop us being Europeans. We speak our own language, that's it.

Finally, you go to ""Why do you think we need independence?"" and the answer will some of ""Because we need to manage our own affairs, because Spain oppresses for centuries and Francoism never ended, because Spain is incompetent and we would do better, because Spaniards (aka Central and Southern Spain) are lazy who live from State jobs and subsidies while we are an entrepreneurial nation, because they say Valencian is a language, because they are corrupt Africa and we are hard-working like a Southern Denmark, etc."" If not in an explicit way, in an implicit way. I know because I was a nationalist for some time and some of these were the underlying reasons that everybody thought but nobody dared to say, but shows its ugly head. Like when thinking that with 2M votes you can declare independence, it's a symptom that, after all, ""half of Catalans are not really Catalans (aka Andalusian immigrants), and if they want independence, great! Welcome aboard! But if they don't want, they should go back to where they come from"", paraphrasing, but a real quote.

So basically, the underlying supremacist views of ""we are better, they are stupid and evil"" are not completely there in open view, but they are nonetheless there, just very blurred. As a word seen through a translucent glass, this thought is there.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/iqo443/today_is_catalonias_national_day_bona_diada_to/g4wqxnz/,SocratesTheBest,1599894393

Where there are cries of owls,

To spill blood onto this soil!

(Communist, load and lock!)

On the trail, inside that gully

They will snuff us on the spot.

&amp;#x200B;

They will lead us all together

And will order squad to shoot.

Do not cry in front of barrels,

Do not lick dust off their boots.

&amp;#x200B;

Not with beer nor with vodka,

This last evening, end of path -

With moonshine we fill our throats

And go on to meet our death!

Fire scares us no more!

2645,"Read my comment again. I literally listed out 10 monarchies, so I don't know why you singled out Sweden.


The term ""Republic"" has its roots in Rome, and simply means ""the matters of the people"". All Western countries function essentially the same, with an elected head of government at the top, and representative democracy. The ""Republic"" of Rome was founded on these principles whilst co-incidentally not being a monarchy. 

The term ""Republic"" in the names of non-democratic countries is not in keeping with the original meaning of Republic, and communicates something fundamentally pointless to outsiders. A Republic, I feel, should be any democratic system (monarchist or not) where the decision makers are elected by the people directly in a multi-party state. 

The word Republic simply meaning ""not a monarchy"", is essentially a useless word, as it means connecting countries, like Syria and Germany, that are far more different than they are similar, and separating countries like Ireland and Britain, who share a legal tradition and roughly similar governmental structure.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/iqvkq6/a_crosswalk_in_belarus/g4wqzus/,greenscout33,1599894451

And then if you look at Sweden, where we are down to 3-5 new deaths and ICU-cases per day, and where we now have one of the lower infection rates in the EU, while still keeping most of society kind-of open the entire time, I can understand that that can make you angry.

That's not to diminish the deaths that took place in the elderly care facilities in the spring, but the Public Health Agency have repeatedly said that a strict lockdown would probably not have helped that much, since if you look at for example Belgium or Netherlands, they had a similar result to Sweden while still having locked down.

2692,"I'm suspicious that this developed to somewhat-questionably game the rules to be able to eat meat during Lent.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent

&gt;Lent (Latin: Quadragesima, 'Fortieth') is a solemn religious observance in the Christian liturgical calendar that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks later, before Easter Sunday. 

-

&gt; Throughout Christendom, some adherents mark the season with the traditional abstention from the consumption of meat, most notably among Lutherans, Roman Catholics and Anglicans.[12][13][14]

-

&gt;Fasting during Lent was more prominent in ancient times than today. Socrates Scholasticus reports that in some places, all animal products were strictly forbidden, while various others permitted fish, or fish and fowl, others prohibited fruit and eggs, and still others permitted only bread. In many places, the observant abstained from food for a whole day until the evening, and at sunset, Western Christians traditionally broke the Lenten fast, which was often known as the Black Fast.[50][51] In India and Pakistan, many Christians continue this practice of fasting until sunset on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, with some fasting in this manner throughout the whole season of Lent.[52]

This is bolstered by the Catholic classification of the capybara, the world's largest rodent, as a fish for Lent purposes:

https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/once-upon-a-time-the-catholic-church-decided-that-beavers-were-fish/

&gt;The Church, by the way, also classified another semi-aquatic rodent, the capybara, as a fish for dietary purposes. The critter, the largest rodent in the world, is commonly eaten during Lent in Venezuela. ""It's delicious,"" one restaurant owner told the New York Sun in 2005.

2754,"&gt; All economic output ultimately is for consumption. It is the horse in front of the cart.

Consumption is indeed the *endgoal*. It cannot be the leader. Your second sentence is simply wrong, but it is probably indicative of typical Turkish attitudes to the economy, which would explain a lot.

 The ultimate driver of growth is productivity, which then allows a country to win market share. Consumption-led growth is a misnomer in an EM country. If you binge on consumption without the exports conmitant to that, then you end up with large and concurrent current-account deficits.

&gt; Turkish exports in dollars have nearly doubled between 2009-2019

Misleading. 2009 saw a massive drop. Look at 2008-2018 instead. It went from ~$13 billion a month to ~$15 billion. [Source](https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/exports). This is discounting tourism which has admittedly grown far faster, but that only underlines my point.

However, even so, he added this in the same article:

""Worth adding, the vast majority of migrants are, just like Swedes, law-abiding citizens. A survey conducted at Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset in Gothenburg on registered crime between 1973 and 2004, showed that 96% of the population was entirely absent in the register for crime of violence. All crimes of violence are committed by a small proportion of individuals. Certain groups, namely men, juveniles and migrants are more prone for violence than others, but it is worth reiterating that the vast majority among then commit no crime whatsoever.

This is particularly important to bear in mind whenever crime statistics on group level is on the agenda. Otherwise populist simplifications will inevitably emerge, such as ‚Äúmigrants commit crimes‚Äù. Generally, the relation between migrants and crime is a delicate issue and should be treated with caution to avoid generalizations and simplifications. There is an ever-present risk, and in Europe today even more so, that groups overrepresented in crime will be stigmatized and discriminated as groups. This leads to a common statistical error among laymen and politicians. The average height of boys in my class says nothing about my height. And the fact that I happen to be tall says little about group average, and even less about another boy in the class. Ethnic groups never commit crimes, individuals do. 

...

Crime statistics only shows individuals registered for crime. Yet, these figures might be exaggerated due to a tendency among crime witnesses - whether consciously or not - to single out migrants.""",,/r/europe/comments/iqtrtn/swedish_pm_connection_between_migration_and/g4wmldw/,Penguistic,1599890238

2780,"&gt; but u/Maikel90 is right that this day has been twisted to mean something else.

u/Maikel90 is wrong when saying that they lost some ""privileges"". What does that even mean? That's a clear example of twisting history. As u/CescQ pointed, Philip V, king of Spain, abolished the institutions and laws of Catalonia, imposing direct rule from Castile and forced the use of Spanish language with the [Nueva Planta decrees
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Planta_decrees); as he also did in Aragon, Majorca and Valencia. Those were the institutions and laws that had been governing Catalonia for 500 years, not a privilege. Generalitat, parliament, contracts law, public order, marriage, etc. I can't understand why would anybody say those are privileges. Were Castile laws and institutions also a privilege? Every country in the world has developed its own institutions and laws.

Their parliaments and institutions were never restored. However, Philip V restored many of these laws shortly after, in Catalonia (1716), Aragon (1711) and Majorca (1715). Probably after realizing it would be impossible to rule this territories with foreign unknown Castillan laws to locals. Whereas Valencia never recovered their laws. This explains why these territories today still have their own private law, so Spanish Civil Code (based on historic Castile law) doesn't apply there. In Catalonia it's the Catalan Civil Code, in Aragon the Aragonese Civil Laws and in the Balearic Islands the Balearic Foral Civil Law. Valencia is ruled by the Spanish Civil Code, as they never recovered their own laws.

&gt; mashes it into a nationalist narrative for the purposes of generating grievance and rage

I can agree to a degree that all national days are mythicized to a certain point. Same goes for Spain's national day. But there's plenty of chronicles of what happened in 1714, and grievance and rage is definitely what Catalans felt at that time. There was a war, and thousands of Catalans perished, those in the army of Catalonia and civilians too. The [Siege of Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Barcelona_(1713%E2%80%9314)) destroyed the city. All these are factual facts. Their national day commemorates the fall of Barcelona after the siege, on 11 September 1714, which is also a fact. Why wouldn't they feel grievance and rage that day of 1714?

The Lucia decision in 1989 by the Social Democratic Government Carlsson to reduce immigration was revoked by the Moderate-led Bildt Government in 1991 and the gates are opened once again... Mainly for asylum immigration.  A direct result of the revocation of the Lucia decision was that the following year ~ 80,000 refugees came to Sweden...

Immigration during the 1940s until the mid-1970s was mainly labor immigration from Finland. Even during the years Palme reigned, labor immigration was the largest and it was mainly from Finland. Between 1945-85, as many as 450,000 Finns came over to work here and around 280,000 returned, the rest remained in Sweden. The number of Finns who have ever worked in Sweden is 700,000 due to this. ~~They were not united in the 80s refugee immigration dominantly marked.~~ It was not until the 1980s that refugee immigration dominated significantly. 

The word ""De"" instead of ""Det"" caused a slight error during translation but it didn't really cause the entire text to be unreadable...

Yes, but that's not how it works in the real world. Politicians just want power like humans do, and prioritize doing whatever keeps them in power.

I understand it to some extent, but I find it difficult to sympathise with. With Lenin, he was one of the figureheads of a great movement of people who genuinely believed that they could build a better society on top of the one that existed, and that belief and hope survived and co-existed, amazingly, with Stalin too. The thing with many of these great twentieth-century social and political movements is that, in the search for the utopia they dreamed of, millions of people were trod upon. While I sympathise today with the lofty ideas of social and economic equality that motivated all of that horror, I can't empathise with a belief system that needs to deify one of the mass-murderers who attempted and failed to implement them at such cost of human suffering.

In the 80's the West installed a puppet dictator in Turkey. He tortured Kurds (together with leftists, right wing people, nationalists and many others).

3009,"It's presently scheduled to open on October 31, 2020.  Planning started in 1991, construction in 2006, and it was originally scheduled to open October 30, 2011 -- it went way over-budget and ran very late.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport

&gt; After almost 15 years of planning, construction began in 2006. Originally planned to open in October 2011, the airport has encountered a series of delays and cost overruns. These were due to poor construction planning, execution, management, as well as corruption.[7][8][9] After several delays,[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] the new airport finally received its operating licence in May 2020 and is scheduled to open in October 2020.[18] At the same time, Tegel Airport will close permanently.[19]

For contrast, the Berlin airport that it is expected to replace, Berlin Tegel Airport, was originally brought into operation -- obviously, much-more-primitive operation, but getting it to the point of functioning for getting cargo and people in and out -- during the Berlin Blockade in a extremely short period of time in difficult conditions with minimal resources and equipment and no ability to transport more in via ground.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade#Preparing_for_winter

&gt;The French Air Force, meanwhile, had become involved in the First Indochina War, so it could only bring up some old Junkers Ju 52s to support its own troops and they were too small and slow to be of much help. However, France agreed to build a complete, new and larger airport in its sector on the shores of Lake Tegel. French military engineers, managing German construction crews, were able to complete the construction in under 90 days. Because of a shortage of heavy equipment, the first runway was mostly built by hand, by thousands of labourers who worked day and night.[89]
&gt;
&gt;For the second runway at Tegel, heavy equipment was needed to level the ground, equipment that was too large and heavy to fly in on any existing cargo aircraft. The solution was to dismantle large machines and then re-assemble them. Using the five largest American C-82 Packet transports, it was possible to fly the machinery into West Berlin. This not only helped to build the airfield, but also demonstrated that the Soviet blockade could not keep anything out of Berlin. The Tegel airfield was subsequently developed into Berlin Tegel Airport.

'Course, for the first one, if the airport wasn't finished in time or didn't have enough throughput, West Berlin was gonna be annexed into East Germany, so the people working on it had a significant incentive.  NIMBYism and red tape was not a concern.

&gt;Given the feasibility assessment made by the British, an airlift appeared to be the best course of action. One remaining concern was the population of Berlin. Clay called in Ernst Reuter, the mayor-elect of Berlin, accompanied by his aide, Willy Brandt. Clay told Reuter:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;""Look, I am ready to try an airlift. I can't guarantee it will work. I am sure that even at its best, people are going to be cold and people are going to be hungry. And if the people of Berlin won't stand that, it will fail. And I don't want to go into this unless I have your assurance that the people will be heavily in approval.""
&gt;
&gt;Reuter, although skeptical, assured Clay that Berlin would make all the necessary sacrifices and that the Berliners would support his actions.[48]",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/iqyuio/national_day_of_catalonia_in_barcelona/g4vhu6t/,duisThias,1599864149

3013,"&gt;  Is it 100% going through?

it's already 100% through. The UK left on Jan 31st. They signed a Withdrawal agreement that started on that date and expires one year later (so 31st Jan 2021). 

The Withdrawal agreement was simply designed to soften the economic shock of British and EU industries and give them time to prepare for the future EU UK relations, give EU citizens some rights and, again, time to adjust to their new situation as foreigners in the UK, and most importantly how to extricate Ulster from the disruption created by Brexit, which requires border checks previously not needed, as Ireland and UK were both part of the Single Market and therefore no border patrolling. 

&gt; And is this really going to be as disastrous to the the UK economy as projected?

will see. Both sides made massively mistaken claims. Idiotic remainers like Cameron threatened economic armageddon the day after the UK voted to leave. That hasn't happened. Idiotic leavers like Gove predicted that the UK would retain most of the economic benefits of the EU membership while getting rid of the obligations, because, as the leave campaign often bumbled, they (the EU) need us more than we need them. Unfortunately for them the EU hasn't let the english govt treat the Single Market as a la carte menu they can freely choose from. So massive disruptions are looming in the next months, as the UK will leave the temporary arrangements in three months time. 44% of UK exports go to EU while the EU exports to the UK are in the order of 8%. 

I find it more likely that economic conditions will slowly degrade in the UK, as they will lose access to the SM and won't be able to replace the trade lost with it by trading more with far flung economies of Asia and the Pacific.

&gt; because the historic trend is towards the betterment of society and globalization.

The one thing that's certain is not betterment of society. It's war, decline of civilisations &amp; replacement. Globalisation is not a certainty, it was thought to be in the 90s but as a student of geopolitics you should not that the world is more and more de-globalising as we speak. 

The only thing that improves is technology over time. And even that is not a guarantee. Einstein did say that WW4 would be fought with sticks and stones.

As to your analysis on the unity of Europe, let alone the survival of our civilisation (which you haven't tackled as you assume it), it is patently wrong.

I do share the belief that some nations may unite, like the Nordics. This is a very likely possibility. But the possibility of a united enlarged EU is not good. It would turn out like a USSR 2.0 or Italy 2.0, with rich and poor zones and thus unequal taxation which would inevitably be opposed (look at Germany and the Nordics already opposing fiscal union with Eurobonds...And you think a union is possible? Hilarious!)

There are too many cultural problems for a true union to exist. The only possibility for a union would be for it to be antidemocratic, with Germany running the entire show (and managing the finances of other states, allocating budgets, etc). That will never happen.

Everything you say is too abstract to be logical in reality. In reality there are too many obstructions to such a megastate. I could say it alternatively...If the people had wanted it, it would have materialised already. Instead we're still left with the same faulty EU.

What I will say positively though is that I wish I were wrong and you were right. I would love a well ordered and prosperous EU superstate. Financially well managed, common EU Army, prosperous citizens. After all that would be the dream right? But I just don't see it happening.

Exactly it's an important part of Turkish history. I'm sure r/Turkey would be the perfect place for it. Turkey and Europe's history certainly are interlinked and large parts of Turkish history is also European history. But Turkey is ultimately in the modern day not a part of Europe (with the small caveat of one small area),and something being Turkish history does not make it immediately relevant to r/Europe whereas something being say Hungarian would make it in most cases relevant to r/Europe. 

There are certainly Turkish events which belong on r/Europe as they played a part in the Europe's history. But less specific events belong here as much as say a post about the history of Persia, China or Ghana.

3128,"One really significant difference is that in Sweden we've had more or less the same restrictions since March. Other countries have lifted quite severe restrictions, which means that people come into contact with each other a lot more than before thus spreading the virus more. Whereas Swedes are still following the same restrictions put in place in March. To my non-epidemiologist brain it seems quite reasonable that the average new case count in Sweden stays constant/is decreasing if you consider that.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who don't know, since a common misconception is that Sweden more or less took no action at all, the restrictions/advice include (aside from frequent hand washing, not coughing on people and reduce social contacts):

* Events with more than 50 people are illegal (including spectators at football matches etc)
* Close contact sports (martial arts etc) were shut down from mid-march to mid-june. This includes regular practice.
* People with the slightest symptoms are advised to self-isolate (and, of course, if you have confirmed covid you need to go into quarantine until you recovered, not doing so is illegal can result in a fine)
* People are advised to work from home if they can to reduce crowding on public transport, and to avoid coming into contact with coworkers.
* People are advised to avoid public transport completely unless absolutely necessary.
* School for people over 16 switched to remote education (high schools and universities opened up this fall, with measures taken to reduce crowding)
* Guests at restaurants/bars have to be seated, and restaurants/bars need to take measures to reduce crowding. If not, they can be shut down permanently (or until the remedied the situation)

The public health agency are also advising the public to avoid to gather with friends, and to keep a physical distance from people in general.

According to MSB (the Agency for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning) \~80% of people are reporting that they are still adhering to the recommendation from the public health authority. It was also found that the travel/movement of people this spring was reduced more or less equally in Sweden compared to that of our neighbours.

In short, (at least in Sweden) you don't need to enact laws in order to get people to behave in a sensible way. Due to the high trust between the government and the public, if the authorities tell people what's good for them, they will follow those recommendation.

I'm sorry what? Since when is a permanent disfigurement of genitals without the prior consent of the person not worthy of outrage?

&gt; None of these terms define circumcision.

You know the funny thing about circumcision is that the term itself is a semantic trick to make it sound like it's some routine procedure and not a horrific crime.

&gt; You cheapen the most heinous, immoral acts we know by equating them with circumcision.

What acts are those? You cheapen the suffering of billions by pretending that genital mutilation is something mundane.

&gt; You do not advance and logical argument relying instead on asinine declarations again feigning outrage

You're delusional if you don't see the logic in my arguments. Do you think 5 year olds should be getting tattoos? IF your answer is something like ""a 5 year old is not old enough for a thing as permanent as a tattoo"" yet you're okay with circumcision then you're nothing but a hypocrite. 

&gt; If you're so emotional about it, just admit it.

Admit what? That mutilating the genital of toddlers is bad? Sure, I admit it. Yes, I am mad that there people like you who are in favour of torturing babies. Does that make you feel like a man that I'm angry that babies are suffering around the world?

&gt; Last but not least, you put words in my mouth because you're consumed by your us vs them mentality.

That's not a bilateral trade deal and much like the EU deal we're pulling out of it requires us to surrender our sovereignty in some aspects.

And Wallonia is still in Belgium, Z√ºrich in Switzerland... you don't seem to understand that Spain is a country made up of different nations, cultures and languages. Spain is not a unitary, on-culture, monolingual country (as Vox believes).

In Madrid you are required to know their language (Spanish) just like you are required to know the language of Galicia, which happens to be Galician. Same thing. If you don't know Spanish, you can't work in Madrid.

&gt; Same in Catalonia.

I don't know about Basque Country. But I know for sure that in Galicia and Catalonia not all people understand or are comfortable speaking Spanish. Because in some areas they only use their language in their daily lives, instead of Spanish. Try going to some villages in Galicia.

You don't seem to understand how individual rights work, and why VOX would eliminate many of these rights with their measures. So go read this: https://twitter.com/jofrellombart/status/1296187665314910211

The law (the exemptions to the prohibition) would need to be modified, which in itself would be similar to plucking a hole in a tax law and doesn't require any justification beyond politically admitting ""well, that was an oversight"". The politicians might not want to open the can of worms (as there is a strong rejection of circumcision of children in Denmark) and just let the courts deal with it, which might be inclined to let it slide, using some complicated legalistic gymnastics, because it'd mean precisely what you've mentioned: an illegal situation going on with no one ever 'noticing', and of course the blowback as many would rightfully consider that what they've been doing all their lives is not suddenly being forbidden, but it was forbidden all along.

Regarding your question: The question is WHO is allowed to sue in case of wrongdoing. (a public prosecutor, which should sue pretty much all he is allowed to, VS the injured party) Probably, no kid is suing his parents, possibly putting them in jail, even if he isn't happy with his circumcision.

On the other hand, there certainly is a statute of limitations. You cannot sue someone for something they did a long time ago (with,sometimes, the exception of murder, but also crimes against humanity.. basically the very worst crimes).

Additionally, FGM is in large part practiced to repress or even eliminate female sexuality which is completely different to ritual circumcision.

**Spain and Italy contain Macron's offensive against the Turkish president**

Southern European countries offer dialogue to Turkey without ruling out sanctions

**Porticcio / Paris -** [**10 SEP 2020 - 22:57 CEST**](https://elpais.com/hemeroteca/2020-09-10/)

Emmanuel Macron visits Bonifacio, in Corsica, before the start of the summit in Porticcio, this Thursday. IAN LANGSDON / AFP

Spain and Italy, supported by Portugal and Malta, joined forces yesterday at the MED7 summit, an informal forum of the southern countries of the EU, to contain the offensive that French President Emmanuel Macron wants to accelerate against Turkey. The summit in Porticcio (Corsica) concluded with a harsh statement in which there is talk of sanctions, but much softer than the one sought by France, Greece and Cyprus, the latter two being the most affected by the aggressiveness of the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan .

[The unusual tension in the Mediterranean](https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-08-26/cuatro-paises-europeos-inician-maniobras-militares-en-el-mediterraneo-ante-la-creciente-tension-con-turquia.html) , which in some delegations worries because it could end in a serious conflict, dominated the meeting. Spain and Italy feared that a harsher message could make things worse rather than solve them. The tone between the presidents in their appearance showed their clear differences. Pedro S√°nchez was the one who most clearly opted for dialogue.

""No dialogue is possible if it is based on a guilty weakness,"" Macron said. ‚ÄúEurope must move from the word solidarity to acts of solidarity. If Turkey wants a sincere dialogue, it must show it, it must stop the provocation, ‚ÄùGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis followed. ‚ÄúWe have a position of empathy with Greece and Cyprus. We have to de-escalate the tension. We are committed to dialogue ‚Äù, declared S√°nchez, clearly the softest. ‚ÄúIt is our obligation to curb the tensions. We have to go to pragmatic solutions ‚Äù, finished the Italian, Giuseppe Conte.

Greece and Cyprus, which are suffering a significant escalation of territorial tension with Turkey, are also pressing for that harsh message against Ankara, but Spain and Italy are much more cautious, according to diplomatic sources, and want to prevent the tension from escalating to the point Erdogan can make some extreme decision. Spain and Italy are closer to the positions of Germany on this matter, always in favor of seeking an agreement with Turkey, a key country for Berlin. Macron did not achieve in the statement the resounding position he wanted on sanctions to take it to the next European Council on the 25th, where the real negotiation will take place.

Macron wants to send a strong message of strength to Erdogan, with which he maintains an obvious tension, while countries like Germany, Spain or Italy are betting on a negotiation. ""Our responsibility as a European member and a Mediterranean country is to find the ways and means of a constructive policy in the Mediterranean, to build this Mediterranean *pax* that allows harmonious exchanges and ensuring that European sovereignty in the region is respected,"" said Macron.

The communiqu√© insists on defending the EU's sovereignty in the Mediterranean against Turkish interference and in solidarity with Greece and Cyprus. It also demands the cessation of Turkey's ""unilateral actions"" in Greek waters, that is, the end of prospecting for gas, as well as respect for the [arms embargo on Libya](https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-08-21/declarado-un-alto-al-fuego-en-libia.html) . ""We reaffirm our determination to use all the appropriate means available to the European Union to respond to these aggressive actions,"" adds MED7. And, at the same time, it expresses the will to restart what Macron called a ""responsible dialogue"" to ""restore balance"" in the EU, which should be developed by the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the High Representative for Foreign Policy from the EU, Josep Borrell.

Warrior rhetoric

The war rhetoric - this summer France has also deployed planes and ships in the area, including military exercises - or the threat of sanctions were softened yesterday. There was more carrot than stick for Ankara.

""This issue is not resolved with sanctions or the use of force, but with negotiation,"" Spanish sources pointed out before the summit. Other sources point out that behind this tension with Turkey is also Libya, another great crisis in the Mediterranean where the positions of France are much further away from those defended by Spain, Italy and Germany.

The French president has spent almost two days with various institutional events on the native island of Napoleon Bonaparte, a character with whom they sometimes seek parallels due to his youth and his combative attitude, also in foreign policy.

Erdogan has embarked on a fight with Greece for the right to explore the gas fields discovered in Greek territorial waters. It has also assumed a key role in the conflict in Libya, with the transfer of militiamen and weapons to the UN-recognized government of Faiez Serraj and confronted Marshal Jalifa Hafter, who until recently had the more or less disguised sympathy of Paris. Erdogan also has the key to open the doors of immigration to the EU.

Show of force before Erdogan? Negotiation? Or both? This is the European debate. Coordinating a position can be more difficult. [Germany - which has a large population of Turkish origin -](https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-08-04/alemania-y-espana-median-para-reducir-la-tension-en-el-mediterraneo-oriental.html?rel=mas) fears a new migrant crisis if Ankara opens the floodgates and is reluctant to a game of powers in which it feels less comfortable than France and therefore tries to mediate between Greece and Turkey , which does not belong to the EU but to NATO, which complicates the puzzle.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/iqrr0u/spain_and_italy_contain_macrons_offensive_against/g4tt729/,BlackEagIe,1599835329

Why wouldn't it make sense the other way? After all you do say that Spanish is a nationality. You don't say Spain is a nationality. Whereas we legally understand Catalonia itself as a nationality ... you see?

Here the interpretation of nationality is that of a 'citizenship' (at most) of a bordered territory. But there is also the interpretation of nationality as *a people*, like your Kurdish example, as an ethnicity if you will. Nations can and do exist without borders and also can and do exist spread through different state borders and through different regions within state borders. Not all nations conform to nation-states nor all nations are defined by states \*substitute states with legally defined borders as applicable. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation :

&gt; A nation is a stable community of humans formed on the basis of a common language, territory, history, ethnicity, or psychological make-up manifested in a common culture. A nation is more overtly political than an ethnic group;[1][2] it has been described as ""a fully mobilized or institutionalized ethnic group"".[3] Some nations are ethnic groups (see ethnic nationalism) and some are not (see civic nationalism and multiculturalism).[3] A nation has also been defined as a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity and particular interests.


Thanks for that legal definition of 'Catalan' which as you can see is also strictly speaking that of a 'citizenship' to a specific bordered region. \*obviously by the nation extending beyond borders I didn't mean as an 'expat'.

And no, I specifically and intentionally have focused on *Catalan as a nationality*, as *a people*.

People also then ignored when multiple people mentioned that on the flip side of this, because we exited lockdown pretty much in time for a new quarter, we would also see a larger bounce back on the other side.

You cannot try and deflate the good news by pointing out the big drop in the previous quarter, without first of all explaining the reason why we had such a large drop. You cannot then ignore the fact that this near 7% growth happened in a single month, and not even in the month where we had a nationwide scheme Eat out to help out, where our hospitality sector got a huge government funded boost, and saw an incredibly influx of customers taking advantage of it.

If they just start enforcing a pre-existent law with that newfound insight, does that mean all Jewish parents are retroactively criminal? Can someone sue them for past transgression? Are all state officials and child services who knew about it guilty of negligence, or hospital staff being accomplices? This is why a unique amendment would almost definitely be in order.

From a practical standpoint, it is not surprising there would be blowback when something that has been going on forever and considered a requirement to even be a religious Jew is banned. If an African country decided to ban the earrings/piercings used in the coming of age rituals of a bunch of tribal groups then they would probably be having a pretty tough time enforcing it.

Nostalgia is for a system where people set aside their ethnic grievances and had to work together without butchering each other as it happened once nationalism was allowed to roam free.

Nostalgia for a more egalitarian economic system, with all its flaws.

Nostalgia for social stability, cohesion and actual law and order, not endless protests, riots, arson, rightoids and leftoids shooting each other, throwing fecal matter at each other and trying to blind police with lasers. 

Each and every system has flaws. None is perfect. Some flaws might put some group off, other flaws another. Just deal with this already. If you're poor and working class, capitalism will put you off, and it's your democratic right to try and overthrow that. If you're a minority that gets abused often (or worse), social issues will be your main concern. If you're a rich corporate thug, engaging in class war against those below you to increase your wealth will likely be your thing.

I'm not a lawyer but the fact that Turkey hasn't signed the UNCLOS treaty means that Greece is the one that goes by the law in this case, at least in most of the points, if not 100%. Otherwise, if Greece was misinterpreting the laws of the convention, Turkey would have signed the treaty and it could easily win its case in international courts.

Furthermore, many countries have taken Greece's side in this dispute calling Turkey's actions illegal, so I guess that's another element pointing that Greece goes by the law or at least it has no claims with major violations.

Of course even in that case Turkey could challenge the fairness of the law. That's acceptable. It could say that in this specific case the law doesn't distribute the seas in a fair way.

3567,"&gt; Its almost the same deal the EU already has with Japan with a few addons on digital services. Its just keeping the status quo.

If this was retweaking the EU-Japan deal, it would be true. But this is an improved deal for both sides as far as the UK and Japan are concerned. That's because bilateral deals are *inherently* simpler and more easily agreed than multilateral deals (the only kind the EU can do). 

&gt; There are 60 more countries the UK has to make a trade deal with + of course the 27 EU countries - just to keep what they already have. 

The EU has around *40* deals, struck with *70* countries. The UK had (as of the beginning of this year) negotiated continuity agreements for about 20 of these, covering *50* countries. Insofar as 'third countries' go, there are less than 20 countries left that the UK would need to make a deal with to keep what they already have (the UK-EU situation notwithstanding).

The Japan deal is a milestone in completing whats left. 

I'd also point out that when the EU 'agrees' a deal, that's not the end of it. It needs to be ratified by every single national parliament which is why the Canada deal (CETA) is only *provisionally* applied, and is still awaiting the ratification of around a dozen EU member states. I don't think its a stretch to imagine that the UK has a fully ratified trade deal with Canada before the EU does...

&gt;  Brexit is such an unnecessary exercise in making everything harder for everyone than it should be.

Nagano states that ""moderate jews don't want secularism"". I guess he means to say that 'even moderate jews want their religious norms to trump secular laws'; ie 'I don't care what you think is right or wrong about how children should be treated, I have the right to circumcise my kid'.

Then ""they want their will imposed on others"" as in: 'parents want to have the right to impose their will on their kids'.

And last ""Danes [as in the majority of danish voters] don't want this""... - and I'm going on a stretch here, because ""jewish propaganda machine"" sounds sarcastic to me, because the use of those words sound like antisemitist propaganda themselves and I'm having holocaust documentary flashbacks here - ""they're afraid of jewish propaganda machine"" is probably meant to be 'international jewish lobbyism' (not just danish jewish lobbyism), but very poorly and crudely worded.

In general, I agree with the position that circumcision practiced on children who cannot give consent as they are underage _is_ already banned, because first of all, the law usually already forbids parents from giving consent to medical procedures unless they are medically necessary. This is a matter of principle on my side and I am also against children getting their ears pierced by their parents 'before they can feel anything'. Although I'm willing to conceded that I'd lower the age of consent for that by children, by law, to something like 16 years, where they are unlikely to be pressured into it by their parents, as the impact seems to be less than, say, [having your ears removed to have your head look like a skull](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=man+has+ears+removed+to+look+like+a+skull).

Regarding your comment differentiating between jews and non-jews. In Europe laws are made for individuals (not tribes, nations or religions); so what's forbidden for one religious group to do to their children is also forbidden to other religious groups.

I mean, in my eyes, what you are proposing is akin to saying 'oh, well, in my religion the priests sometimes diddle our kids, but we're fine with it. You should totaly legalise it, because a) it's how our religion rolls, and b) I, as a parent of my kid, give consent in their name' or 'well, in my religion we sometimes unearth the remains of our dead and then eat a piece of it. but it's totally fine, because in my religion that's the custom and I'm their descendant, so I give my consent' and I believe none of it should fly.

3641,"&gt; Not sure what either metric has to do with the article. 

Doesn't. I'm going off on a tangent.

&gt; The pumping of money per capita into Luxembourg is because it has by far  the most EU institutions and workers per capita, nothing more. 

Indeed. Providing jobs that all EU members have to pay for (some using their own currency of lower value than the euro) in a country that has one of the highest average labour costs in the EU. While placing those institutions there in the first place came about when the EU was smaller and fewer options were available right now it just seems like willful wastefulness. But that's because the EU institutions are not private sector and don't need to be competitive (which is good in some ways, but also bad in others). Not to mention Brussels also hosts a very significant number of EU institutions (though the more prominent ones with fewer individuals while Luxembourg has the administrative core of suits and ties) and it doesn't look as jarring on such a metric as Luxembourg does.

The EU functions best when the member states have the same economic principles (including tax laws) and even better when the countries have similar levels of wealth and development. In my perspective allowing tax havens into the EU is overall harmful to all the other member states (though I'm sure some would argue this point, feel free to share your viewpoint those of you who are neck deep in political economy). Placing EU institutions in Luxembourg is like rewarding the kid who disrupts class in my opinion. Being a tax haven already makes it easier for those countries to siphon economic growth from other member states, I don't see the need to hire their citizens and rent their property at exorbitant rates to run the EU bureaucracy.

But we all know that the distribution of institutions is not driven by economics, but purely by politics. It is especially evident when due to France's stubbornness many decades ago we now have an EU Parliament which meets for 3 weeks in Brussels, and then one week in Strasbourg because the French wanted so. How many countries can move their parliament location over 350 km twice a month (including the costs of moving all the materials and personnel) and not have the citizens call that pointless waste of their tax money? Of course I'm oversimplifying difficult political maneuvering, but the EU citizenry do not care about the details, they judge based on what they see.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the contributions are not based on the number of poorer people in a country 

I know how this works, I wasn't going to write 3 paragraphs explaining. Though I realize ""poorer than westerners"" in my post was a very shortcut way to say it.

&amp;#x200B;

So in short:

&gt;Any unfairness perceived in the EU funding rules is not a justification for irregularities I'm the handling of EU funds. The unfairness, in my opinion mainly the distribution of EU institutions across the countries,  has to be handled in EU parliament and the council.

3702,"There is a strong problem with that.

There are multiple ways to make an EU Army. One of these would be to create an Army in addition to the national member states armies. The problem is that this army would have to duplicate everything compared to existing ones: maintenance facilities, logistical units, training facilities, support units, etc. Additionally, there would be competition between EU and national armies for recruitment, likely reinforced by the salary differences (EU soldiers would likely all be paid similarly at equal rank)

Alternatively, there could be an EU Army replacing national ones. The issue is what happens to foreign policy in that case. The Armed Forces are useful tools for foreign policy. Their strength and use provide weight to whatever you are saying and in a crisis, it is always nice for the other side to know that you can back up your position with force if necessary.

This means that national foreign affairs now see their effectiveness severely reduced. In order not to kneecap overall European foreign affairs, it should thus also be moved at EU level.

This raises a few other problems. First and foremost, reactivity. Although in foreign affairs, long term efforts are often rewarded, in both foreign and military affairs, the ability to react quickly to crisis is capital for the standing of the state and the effectiveness of the response. But if there is one thing the EU has proven to be bad at, it is reacting to crises with speed, both in economical and foreign affairs. If we want an EU to be effective, we simply cannot continue relying on complex unanimity-based negotiations for every single significant decision. This means giving far more power to the Commission and putting in place the democratic oversight mechanisms necessary, altering significantly both the institutions and the nature of the EU, moving it towards a federation (not that it would be a bad thing).

Additionally, since national security concerns have now shifted to the EU, national intelligence and counter-intelligence services would need to be transferred to the EU. This means, especially in the later case, that investigation and prosecution powers are given to the EU which sees its judiciary branch drastically augmented with the creation of the first European crime: treason. Based on that, EU law would increasingly be considered as a thing of its own, with its own prosecutors, tribunals and judges.

At this point, I seriously hope we have a Constitution...

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I will say this. Whatever your opinion on what foreign policy the EU should hold. The EU should not be forced to have this foreign policy by design. It should be a policy of the government supported by the legislature. There are ways to reduce the likelihood of a war (for example giving the legislature the power to declare war) but these tools are not absolute (you can't have the legislature decide of every military intervention as it would destroy the reactivity of the executive).","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/iq3yrr/europe_the_end_of_na√Øvety/g4t1ml9/,loicvanderwiel,1599813634

They don't count for anything in our society. You can rip a child from her mother, rape her, it's unimportant, it doesn't matter. 

But you don't seem to believe animals are things. And if animal live has value, why are we still allowed to kill and exploit them?",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/iqm7yu/swine_fever_found_in_germany_putting_pork_exports/g4t1s11/,Bojarow,1599813803

Turkey just like any country is NOT forced to sign any treaty at all. Turkey is also an objector to UNCLOS, like literally since its signing. How are rules it does not consent to bind it? AND how are you forgetting other customary rules and aggreements that actually apply to this problem?

Turkey and Greece have very close borders on some regions of Aegean See. Due to the islands that are very close to Turkey. For decades both parties more or less accepted equidistance principles for those. And now you expect those islands to create an Economic zone? That is stupid and not in accordance with the international law at all. Some Greek islands are literally meters away from Turkish coast. Thats why the status quo was to accept an equidistance principle. Greece is not an archipelago country, it does not get to consider all the sea between the islands its own sea borders. Greece has a continental mainland it can draw its economical zone, the islands are governed by the equidistance principle.

3833,"The Anglosphere countries aren't British though. British identity is one of the factors which contributed to the formation of Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and American identity to varying degrees. But so did other immigrant cultures, the native peoples, and their own experiences. 

Look at Newfoundland (which is just about the most Irish place outside of Ireland itself) or Boston. The primary influence there is Irish culture for sure. Plus Irish and British culture are interlinked anyway - Britain had a huge influence on Irish culture and vice versa by the nature of being neighbours and part of the same country for the better part of three centuries.

Not that any of that really matters because the comment that started this chain was talking about how for Britain ""most people have cousins and Aunts and Uncles that live in those countries"". Cultural links aside, that statement is equally true for Irish people, as there are a huge number of people in those countries today who were born in Ireland or are first generation immigrants - quite likely more (per capita at least) than for the UK. 

17.5% of all adults who were born in Ireland live in one of the OECD countries and that mostly means the Anglosphere countries in our case. I myself have close relatives in Australia and the US, and several people I went to school with have moved to Canada and Australia.

Only poor people with subsidies that make for a pittance rent and young people that don't have enough for a 5-20% down-payment really rent. And students - making most of those 120%+ mortgage payment rents in shared apartments. Young people often choose to stay with parents and save the rent money for a down-payment (and that's where the stay at home till 30 statistics come from). 

A lot of the older generation ends up with a house and a holiday home or two. They sell of the holiday home at some point in retirement and then the house for a smaller apartment (though that's more recent). Or you can do a special kind of contract where the kids get ownership under inheritance conditions, but take on the full responsibility of financial care - either with the parent staying in the house as well or moving to a retirement home.

Also for a long time having a retirement savings account has been complete nonsense. We had a couple of collapses in private savings showing they're not untouchable as thought before 2008, the public ones with government assurance pay out a pittance - not even 10% of monthly pay-in. And doing a retirement savings a a bank is only slightly better - the rate is almost non-existent due to EOM and you pay (reduced) income tax on pay-out.

And? And the end everyone also speaks English and is simply able to consume English language culture because this is the language the vast majority of culture is created in. Meanwhile, culture created in Spanish is only accessible to Spanish speaking people and Hopi speakers have no idea of it mostly.

&gt;in europe (the capitals) many people speak english

But it doesn't mean they use it to create culture, they mostly use it in contacts with foreigners. How many English language movies are made in Czechia so a Hungarian who knows English could watch them? People who know English watch American movies and probably Los Angeles is more of a cultural capital to them than any other Central European city from another country. I don't remember if I ever watched a Czech or Hungarian movie while I watch tens of American ones every year simply because there's little cultural exchange between Central European states due to a language barrier. The only difference are states where there's no language barrier like Czechia and Slovakia and everyone understands each other.

Not to mention only a small percent of people speak English well enough to consume the English language culture without translation.

Anyway, there's simply no such concept like a cultural capital for all of Central Europe, because Central Europe is only a set of loosely connected countries due to geographic proximity and some similar historical experiences.

Also, the Rafale airplanes will completely change the military power balance between the 2 countries. These are great planes, better than the F16s Turkey has.

He has laundered money for them for many years, billions of dollars through his New York and Florida real estate businesses. Donald Trump is the most corrupt and worst president in the history of the United States of America. 

He is directly responsible for the deaths of almost 200,000 people in only 6 months due to his failure to do anything to help with the Covid-19 virus. He does not care about Americans, only about money and getting 
re-elected. He is worse than any leader you have ever had, past or current. Half of us hate him for his daily lies and scams; over 1,000 of us die every day here because of his mistakes and his terrible actions and lies and lack of leadership but many people here love him and think he is great.

 In Europe taxes are high but it comes back to people as better education, cheaper healthcare, public transportation, public services, child support, unemployment support, etc. In the USA also state system creates more confusion 

But my humble opinion is better healthcare in the USA can be made under state law, not under government law. in the end, it comes down to what people want you might want it but it is hard to change people's minds (especially in the USA) they are born with this individualist freedom.

4091,"Its quite complicated, Petain was the great hero of WW1, a generation of soldiers fought under his leadership and the generation of officers/politicians formed during the interwar inherited this reverence.

As for WW2, there was first a huge belief that Petain wanted to sign the armistice to prepare revenge and avoid complete destruction at a time where everyone else had fallen, Britain was pulling out and the USA still couldnt afford to publicly denounce isolationism. This belief was held by the vast majority of the population, including for instance his right-hand man and the co-author of the national revolution: General Weygand. 

This situation lasted well into 1941-42 before the meeting of Montoire, operation Lila and the ever stronger grasp of Hitler on Vichy's internal politics through Laval and his cronies implementing a purge of the Weygandist faction dispelled the illusion.

Today's perception of Petain was forged by the declassification of national archives and the work of three generations of historians.

Back in the 50s it was near impossible to muster a case solid enough to damage the sheer amount of prestige and respect the man instilled.

Killing him was more or less a matter of appeasing the communist branch of the National Liberation Commitee but wanting to reconcile the French people ASAP, De Gaulle commuted his death sentence and had him exiled on an island to get it over with and moved on.",France,/r/europe/comments/ipzs51/on_this_day_75_years_ago_vidkun_quisling_head_of/g4rx2m7/,GeistHeller,1599784891

Let's see the UK leave UN first. Not sure there will remain muchbif their ""Global Britain"" Brexit plan (if anything even remains now that the UK has shown it will break international treaties)


&gt; A new fair trade deal.

Maybe instead of UK asking for the right to have British trucks drive around in the EU yet unbound by EU rules, the UK should offer something fair indeed.

&gt; Unfair conditions.

You enter my house, you follow my rukes is unfair?


&gt; It's working on just that

We'll see how long that last. No EU-UK deal + this week's legislation means the UK breaks the GFA. US already declared a breach if the GFA means no US-UK trade deal.

UK loses 41 trade deals in 3 months. It needs deals.


&gt; Then expect the UK not to ever play nice again with anything else. Including fishing.

UK can be as salty as it wants. Either it obeys international law or leaves UN.

&gt; They should then give the UK the same type of deal as Canada got.

UK ain't asking for that. They're asking for Canada++ (e.g. Canadian truck companies don't tend to drive all over the EU, UK is asking forvthis without following EU rules)


&gt; The fact they won't ~~shows they are bullying and it's not just business. It's revenge and making an example out of the UK for daring to defy them.~~

From my perspective that emphasis on protecting EU companies from foreign acquisitions is mostly just PR in relation to China and the EU will continue to let itself be pushed around by the US.

In relation to the potential acquisition of Nokia/Ericsson by the US I think the EU will protest but ultimately allow it, though that move is still questionable if it will go forward by the US. They have two possible strategies in relation to 5G, either accept that 5G will be delayed in the West as Nokia/Ericsson lack the financing and the belt to set it up as fast as Huawei, or they can try this acquisition move and finance those companies so they can setup 5G faster.

Your point about the dominance of the US and the UK in the anglosphere makes sense. The general public is more inclined to pay attention to the problems that make headlines in the news and anything else gets swept under the rug, which in this case are the Indigenous communities' plight. This is of course not to say that the headline countries are not also responsible for similar atrocities, but to act like one's country is above that, or to treat it as a problem of the past is a different type of cruelty. And even if it was a thing of the past, that doesn't mean that there are no lasting effects today. I suppose that is what you mean when you said that erasure was a tool of colonialism.

Recently I have been browsing r/CANZUK and a major foundation of the movement is apparently the shared historical ties between the four main anglosphere countries, which are the UK, Canada, Australia, and NZ. The sub frequently posts statistics indicating how much of the population in each country is in favor of joining the bloc, but I wonder if those numbers would be any different if they included Indigenous communities in the polling.

In the treaty of Po≈æarevac (Passarowitz) after the Austro-Turkish war 1716-1718, the Republic of Ragusa (today Dubrovnik, Croatia) explicitly desired for two stripes of land (Klek - that's the part of coastline that Bosnia has today; and Sutorina, south of Dubrovnik, today in Montenegro) to be ceded to the Ottoman Empire to form two small corridors, so they (Ragusa) would avoid having the land border with Venice, that acquired new territories in today region of Dalmatia, Croatia.

Despite borders being changed quite few times after that (after Napoleon abolished the Republic of Ragusa, only to return after Austria's annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then change again following the institution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918 and Yugoslavian Constitution in 1921), when the internal borders of the new Yugoslavia during the WWII were being defined the AVNOJ (war council that eventually formed the Yugoslav government in the WWII) instituted the borders that followed the borders that Bosnia had during Austrian rule.

Look at your compatriots getting hard at the thought of Turkey being a regional power and warring in the Middles East under operations ""Peace Spring"" and ""Olive Branch"". If this is how you feel about territories that you lost nearly 2 centuries ago and were never yours originally I can only imagine how you would feel about Bulgaria if you had a legitimate claim. It would have everything to do with the Sultan and politics.    

And you ask me, how are Turks doing in Bulgaria, how are they doing in the Balkans, well for one thing they're doing pretty good *now* and for another now or in the past they still did a million times better than Christians did in Turkey. Imagine taking over the lands of the most famous Christian empire with the most immutable European culture, that is the basis of Westernism,  and managing to turn it into the 6th least Christian country in the world.

4385,"well lets take a look at the chapters shall we?

https://i.imgur.com/4VfJJJV.png

6 chapters blocked by cyprus
3 chapters blocked by france

the rest were already blocked from the very start by the european council because of the cyprus issue

blocking chapters regarding fundamental rights for example which would have lead to significant reforms in turkey really helped to transform the big bully right?

people like me wanted this process to go on just so that turkey will reform itself during this process even if it doesnt end in full membership yet please tell me, blocking a well known serial human rights offender like turkey from doing significant judicial reforms under the watchful eye of the EU serves what? 

opening the chapter on foreign, security and defense policy for example, wouldn't encouraging turkey to reform these areas beneficial for a country that is partly occupied by turkey? isnt cyprus shooting itself on the foot there by blocking any substantial change from happening inside turkey? 

everybody can understand cyprus blocking energy or free dom of movement fo workers but  

judiciary and fundamental rights?
justice freedom and security?
education and culture?
foreign security and defense policy?

arent these the main problem areas that the EU is having with turkey? isnt there a correlation there where turkey suffered massive slideback in these areas after the chapters were blocked after 2009?

Turkey stops refugees from entering the EU of which Turkey often likes to remind us. If they would open the gates Germany would likely have to take refugees in, what in turn would lead to more support for rightwing parties especially the AFD and worse election outcomes for the governing parties.
Secondly Money... Turkey is pretty far from being a country that respects human rights but also a very lucrative customer regarding weapons. So good in fact that we allowed them to produce our weapons in their factories. Fun fact: Turkey is not allowed to export those weapons. Guess where they appeared ? - Belarus...

4553,"It is one of the main assets that are absent. State obligations that are not in this statistic.

It may also be the case that the German housing market is less valuable because many homes are owned by institutions that aren't purely market orientated. This means that capital cannot extract maximum value out of many German homes, which means they are given a lower monetary value. But since homes are things to live in for most people, not pieces of capital that generate wealth, this is a loss to the capitalist system but not to society.

Think of it like this. Children have no value in this statistic, not because they are not valued by their parents, but because their parents can't sell them for money. If there were a market for children, then parents would have higher net wealth in this statistic. So no market means no wealth, under capitalism. In German society, it might also be the case that the institutions that rent most homes are not entirely free being of the property market, so they can't squeeze the last euro out of their legal rights as owners. If that were the case, then capitalism would put lower values on those homes, compared to identical homes in the UK, where the property market is more friendly to the interests of capital.",,/r/europe/comments/iq5f42/median_wealth_per_adult_in_europe/g4pgnnu/,but_what_about_3G,1599756365

4625,"I think you misunderstood the question being asked here. It isn't about whether Canadians like or dislike America but about which relations do you view most favourably.

Currently, our border is completely closed because of the insanely reckless response to COVID-19, so that's a big minus. But then you've got the US President who openly hates our Prime Minister. Another minus. The US has sabotaged our major military alliance (NATO) and backed out of an important climate agreement (Paris), of which we are a part. NAFTA was aggressively renegotiated and both Canada and Mexico were accused of a lot of bad things. There is also ongoing trade disputes, such as with aluminum or lumber and some of these were started recently by Trump. Oh and let us not forget that the US President and many of its politicians support Vladimir Putin, who is actively trying to undermine democracies around the world, including ours. Basically, can the US even be considered an ally? I would say no.

Now you can say Trump is not America but he got actually almost 50% of the vote and won under your electoral system. Moreover, despite being an obvious criminal rapist psychopath, he was not removed by your Senate, which further represents the American people. Until recently, nobody has been protesting in the streets against this maniac, which gives passive support to him and everything he does.

Besides all of that, there are longer term problems with relations, including the already mentioned trade disputes (softwood lumber comes to mind). Then you had Bush trying to bully us into joining the Iraq war and leaving us out of the list of countries thanked for 9/11 as a result of our refusal to join, despite all our help and support for America, including in Afghanistan. We used to enjoy the ability to go to the US without a passport but that was cancelled by protectionist politicians, under the guise of security, some of whom actually blamed Canada for 9/11, despite none of the terrorists coming from or through Canada.

At the end of the day, while Canadians do have a massive inferiority complex when it comes to the US, we also don't actually hate America. We just like to dump on it to make ourselves feel better. But that is not related to diplomatic relations. In the last few years, the US has turned against us and our allies and at least half the country has been fully behind that.

And, even then, the question was simply who has the best relations with your country. Now, do you think the above-mentioned country is going to beat out the one that founded our country (who we did not overthrow), which we fought and died for to protect and which also houses our head of state and royal family?

4645,"Following the publication by the UK government of the draft¬†‚ÄúUnited Kingdom Internal Market Bill‚Äù¬†on 9 September 2020, Vice-President Maro≈°¬†≈†efƒçoviƒç¬†called for an extraordinary meeting of the EU-UK Joint Committee to request the UK government to elaborate on its intentions and to respond to the EU's serious concerns. A meeting took place today in London between Vice-President Maro≈°¬†≈†efƒçoviƒç¬†and Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

The Vice-President stated, in no uncertain terms, that the timely and full implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland ‚Äì which Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his government agreed to, and which the UK Houses of Parliament ratified, less than a year ago ‚Äì is a legal obligation. The European Union expects the letter and spirit of this Agreement to be fully respected. Violating the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement would break international law, undermine trust and put at risk the ongoing future relationship negotiations.

The Withdrawal Agreement entered into force on 1 February 2020 and has legal effects under international law. Since that point in time, neither the EU nor the UK can unilaterally change, clarify, amend, interpret, disregard or disapply the agreement. The Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland is an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement. Its aim is to protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland and was the result of long, detailed and difficult negotiations between the EU and the UK.

Vice-President Maro≈°¬†≈†efƒçoviƒç¬†stated that if the Bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an extremely serious violation of the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law.

If adopted as proposed, the draft bill would be in clear breach of substantive provisions of the Protocol: Article 5 (3) &amp; (4) and Article 10 on custom legislation and State aid, including amongst other things, the direct effect of the Withdrawal Agreement (Article 4). In addition, the UK government would be in violation of the good faith obligation under the Withdrawal Agreement (Article 5) as the draft Bill jeopardises the attainment of the objectives of the Agreement.

The EU does not accept the argument that the aim of the draft Bill is to protect the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement. In fact, it is of the view that it does the opposite.

Vice-President Maro≈°¬†≈†efƒçoviƒç¬†called on the UK government to withdraw these measures from the draft Bill in the shortest time possible and in any case by the end of the month. He stated that by putting forward this Bill, the UK has seriously damaged trust between the EU and the UK. It is now up to the UK government to re-establish that trust.

He reminded the UK government that the Withdrawal Agreement contains a number of mechanisms and legal remedies to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text ‚Äì which the European Union will not be shy in using.",EUROPEANS.

But the larger countries got more gains due to their strength. And there was a common sense that there must be a common ground in the end. So nobody actually dared to even remotely threaten with a veto.   
Well that idea is gone. Countries do dare to threaten veto if they won‚Äôt get what it wants if it‚Äôs really important for them.  I fully understand Cyprus for taking the zero appeasement approach. They have 1/3 of their country occupied, wonder why they are upset after seeing the succes of appeasement for 40+ years.. /s

Taking a hard stance towards Belarus by the EU but looking away from Turkey is hypocritical.

Back in the early 1990s, the federal interior ministry dismantled the nationwide siren network to cut costs. The individual municipalities had the option to buy ""their"" sirens from the ministry, which many, but not all did. Most sirens then were converted to radio control for cost reasons, because almost nobody wanted to pay the hefty rent for the landlines they used to be connected with. Depending on the intended use of the sirens, radio controllers with different capabilities were installed. Especially in rural areas, the predominant use case for the sirens was alerting the local volunteer fire brigade, so, often siren controllers with the only capability of triggering the signal ""fire alarm"" (three long tones) were installed, because more capable controllers cost extra, and nobody really cared about warning the population anymore with the perceived end of the cold war.",Europe (Germany),/r/europe/comments/ipwxo7/germany_countdown_to_warning_day_underway_on/g4n4rqg/,whatnever,1599727753

Those that were tested were sicker and COVID looked more deadly. In reality, there were way, way more people who had COVID but were mild and didn't or couldn't get tested. I saw reports that said there might have been 10X or more cases per day than reported. Because only the sickest patients could be tested, COVID looked more deadly. Now,  more people are able to get tested even wth milder symptoms, the reported daily cases are closer to the actual number of daily cases and the IFR (fatality rate) is approaching what is actually the fatality rate of COVID which is low.",,/r/europe/comments/ipvm2b/european_second_wave/g4mqjwk/,Catusa,1599720230

5152,"WTF is happening in those comments ?? I feel like a bandwagon of angry conservatives decided to make this story their own without any other context of what happened in the first place and of the French laws that protect the tenants against owner malpractice.

This article is a bad sensationalist spin on a biaised right wing article from the newspaper ""Le Figaro"". It fails to mention that :

- according to the squatters, they were duped in thinking that they entered a lease with a con artist, paying him rent : that still has to be proven.
- there is no proof that the squatters did change the locks of the house themselves.
- the victims do have multiple homes (their main home being at a 2hours drive), and that that they do not live in the squatted house yet, also explaining why the autorities take their time in insuring everything is good.
-there is by no means any kind of push to change the law... other than the one initiated by the same newspaper that the article is copied from.

Furthermore, the article goes into great lengths to contextualize how bad squatting is and how difficult it is to kick squatters out, but doesn't say anything about the rising housing crisis in the country and the fact that there is a phenomenon of secondary houses hoarding that clutters uselessly the market and kills communities in the countryside.

Lastly, I can't understand why some of you guys make such a big deal that the family has an Arab sounding name (bold of you of assuming he is a migrant btw, he is most certainly French and no foreigner. Le Figaro would've told the world and beyond otherwise). 
Are you guys mad that a poor family happens to be ""Arab"" ? Or that an ""Arab"" family happens to be poor ?

But realistically, I'm not sure whether this ""diplomatic protection"" has any legal meaning.  I believe that diplomats can grant protection at an *embassy*, because normally host nations agree not to send police into an embassy without agreement from the diplomatic mission there.

Let us say your country is invaded.  Cool.  Let us say it's a ridiculously organized effort that happens over the course of mere days.  Cool.  

They show up to your town ready to shoot every elderly person and every child in the street, take all your money and belongings that are of worth, and starve you over the course of your occupation. But... OH NO!

You didn't organize a militia and get it officially recognized!  You didn't even manage to start a grassroots movement with a name!  You only had time to grab the nearest blunt object as all the able bodied and willing of your town prepared to defend themselves and stand amongst them against soldiers that were ready to slaughter you no matter what.  

You stare at the object in your hand and let it go.  You can't defend yourself or your town. 

 Since it is a military force invading you, and since you are not part of any recognized force yourself, it is a heinous *war crime* to defend yourself against these invading forces.  You go to your home.  Gunshots rain down upon your peers.  But its ok, they were committing a war crime.

You pet your dog for the last time before it is shot while attacking the soldiers that barge into your home, but its ok.  they were defending themselves.  You sit and do nothing as your mother and child are taken from the house.  Your mother looks at you and turns her head, knowing she raised a coward.  She spits at a soldier and slaps him.  you hear the gunshot echo through the streets as she is made an example.  But its okay.  She assaulted the soldier, and thats illegal.  Your child is put into a camp and dies of starvation two weeks later.  But its ok, they said it was a crime if he didnt go. You die from starvation yourself, despite not giving anyone around you who died much earlier any extra food because sharing was outlawed after the invasion.

&gt; ""We blew up the doors, I think of a school. Children were standing in the hall and on the stairs. Lots of children. All with their small hands up.

Blood streamed down the stairs. There is a memorial plaque in that place stating that 350 children were killed. I think there were many more, maybe 500.""

Many times a group raped the same woman, quickly, still holding weapons in their hands. Then after one of the fights, I was standing shaking by the wall and couldn't calm my nerves. Dirlewanger soldiers burst in. One of them took a woman. She was pretty. She wasn't screaming.

No such thing, that is, usually that's a rationalization.

&gt; It is true that a helicopter can be used as a gunship and it can also be used to rescue people from a mountain pass. And if the question arises of how a specific device is going to be used, in what I call an abstract ideal society, then one might very well say one cannot know. 

&gt; But we live in a concrete society, [and] with concrete social and historical circumstances and political realities in this society, it is perfectly obvious that when something like a computer is invented, then it is going to be adopted will be for military purposes. It follows from the concrete realities in which we live, it does not follow from pure logic. But we're not living in an abstract society, we're living in the society in which we in fact live.

5244,"On average, there were almost 11 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants resulting from suicide in the EU in 2016.

**Standardised death rates for suicide: highest in Lithuania, lowest in Cyprus**

In 2017, among the EU Member States, Lithuania registered the highest rate of suicide at 26 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, followed by Slovenia (20 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants), Latvia (18), Estonia and Hungary (both 17).

At the opposite end of the scale, Cyprus recorded the lowest standardised death rates for suicide (4 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants), followed by Greece and Malta (both 5), Italy (6) and Slovakia (7).

**Regional patterns for standardised death rates for suicide**

When looking at regional data (NUTS2), the Central and Western regions of Lithuania recorded the highest standardised death rate for suicide at 28 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants. This was followed by Luxembourg, in the Walloon Region in Belgium, with 25 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, the South Great Plain in Hungary (23) and East Slovenia (23).

At the other end of the scale, the regions with the smallest number of deaths resulting from suicide were: Mayotte in France (in 2016), Campania in Italy, Ceuta in Spain and Central Greece (Sterea Ellada) in Greece. All of these recorded a standardised death rate for suicide of 3 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants.

That's why they call the natives, Native Americans, to differentiate them from the rest, the immigrated Americans.They can have their country. That's fine.

What is not fine is when they claim they are something they are not and appropriating history that is not theirs.

They still use a flag that was originally not theirs, they just appropriated it cause the Hellenic Macedonians used it, in an effort to show ""connection"" to them. A lot of them still claim they are related to the ancient Macedonians. That's why I have the attitude that I have towards them. They can be the North Macedonian Slavs, that's fine, which is the more accurate naming.

For a country and a populous that has been getting bashed by everyone else and has been getting the short end of the stick since its modern conception as an independent country, history is a very important thing and when you try to take it away from them, then they will obviously not sit idly and watch you do it.You are Swedish so you might no understand why people are getting as riled up as they are ""over just a name"", since you don't have a horse in this race. But what if a new country got created, called North Sweden, from some people that moved next to Sweden, from Germany(for example) and they claimed that, no they are related to the Vikings, and they are vikings, basically appropriating a major part of your heritage and history. Would you be okay with that?

I will say it again, they can be their own thing and that is perfectly fine, as long as they do not appropriate symbols and history that is not theirs to claim to begin with. Because if we let this go unchecked then in 100 or 200 years that might be considered the norm, that they are indeed the real macedonians, and they are connected to the ancient Hellenic Macedonian kingdom.

It isn't talked about enough that for a significant portion of the population in the Baltics who reached adulthood during the Soviet occupation, at least some parts of the indoctrination stuck (just look at the amount of knee-jerk homophobia among those generations, for example), and they never really managed to readjust to, much less thrive in, a free market economy nor democracy. This is why you get plenty of people from here embarrassing themselves by idolizing a dictator because ""he's made sure everything is in order"" and the streets in Minsk are supposedly all nice and clean, and the prices are cheap (of course they look cheap when you're a tourist from an EU country).

Oh, and your neighbour knows damn well there were classes in the Soviet Union. Only the Nomenklatura really ""lived well"", as in, didn't need to hustle to cover basic needs, never mind anything more extravagant. For the rest, being reasonably well fed depended on your family's capacity to grow your own food, because food shortages were basically normal. There was always something basic you could not get from the shops, usually meat (the Baltics produced fucktons more of it than we do now, but nearly all of that got siphoned off to feed Russia), but also flour or dairy - I remember going to the grocery store with my mom as a pre-schooler on a winter night, and an actual fight breaking out in a queue for butter. (Which might seem a bit bourgeois, so I'll specify that yes, Soviet margarine existed, but was gross.)

\- While in the EU there was no problem. It was the UK's decision to leave. The first withdrawal agreement included the whole UK into the common market to avoid this problem. The UK negotiated this and then changed its mind. The current agreement allowed for more time to solve this problem. The EU wanted more time, the UK opted out.

\- The EU has been clear an open border is only possible if they can protect their own market. Therefore, the Brexit agreement set up a joint committee to determine which goods were at risk. The UK signed this treaty. Now the UK is moving this power away from the committee and giving itself the option to make decisions unilaterally. 

\- CPTPP only became a thing because the USA walked away. Furthermore, I just don't see how a free trade agreement not concerning the EU, USA, or UK is relevant.

5469,"&gt; The EU doesn't have a trade deal with China or India. I'm just explaining that you think a US trade deal is the be all and end all, whilst alot of people in the UK wouldn't be bothered because they know it equates with a reduction of food standards.


except that the size of the EU economy allows the businesses of the single market to already have a sizeable self sufficient market, and clout to obtain better conditions in trade negotiations with its partners. Simply put, the EU doesn't need a trade deal with China as much as the UK, a market almost 1/10th of the EU single market. 

Since Brexit will lead to a loss of trade for the British businesses that previously traded with the EU, in order to be successful they need to make up for that by trading more with markets in the same league of the EU, so US, China, India, etc. Which is why the UK is trying to join the trans pacific partnership.

5656,"&gt; I would disagree on that. At least in germany I would say the biggest reason for supporting the EU is ideological moreso than about some benefits for germany.

That might be true for you on a personal level but Germany massively benefits from the EU and I highly doubt that doesn‚Äôt enter into the German people‚Äôs fondness for it. 

&gt; Because we have a system of open borders and we can't just put the entire burden on the southern states. We are in this union together.

The burden will be on them anyway and likely will get worse if encouraged. 

&gt; Also you still have control over this at the EU level

Not full control and EU elections have very little turnouts 

&gt; I don't think there is a sense of superiority. More of a sense of right and wrong. A sense of morality.

I don‚Äôt mean superiority in a way of believing your ideas right but more that your ideas are so right and good that everyone will naturally accept them and agree. That their beliefs aren‚Äôt held as strongly and will cave to your superior system. 

&gt; Honestly I am not convinced that inviting EE wasn't a mistake, but it was the hubris after the fall of the Warsaw Pact that made the west take stupid decisions.

Agreed and it still is an issue to this day. 

&gt; There is also a major difference between dealing with shady rulers and having shady rulers be part of the ujnion.

There are plenty of shady leaders in the union. Poland and Hungary just get the most attention since they don‚Äôt play ball. 

The ones who do get a pass and have no way near the same amount of criticism. 

&gt; That doesn't really make sense to me. You can't just have part of the command.

Sure you can, NATO does it. 

&gt; If none of the plans work then the best plan has to be one that probably won't work. I also don't think ""willing countries"" is a realistic alternative.

I never implied they own these people.

Yet every Russian will be quick to tell you that what happens over there is not indicative of how the rest of Russia functions. This is what initially triggered your complaining in this thread.

&gt;When it comes to this savagery, sorry to break it to you but that's Russian style savagery that is imported to Caucasus with Russian cronies

Because Chechnya is such a magical place, except for that evil Russian minority.

&gt;And yeah, nobody likes him yet likes him oppressing the nation he rules over.

He keeps the region from spiraling into a complete clusterfuck as it tends to do, but he and his choose their own methods. In the end, it's a Chechen ruler deciding that a bottle up the ass is the way to go about ruling over his people.

5703,"&gt;And that is a nice idea in theory. In practice it is often hard to determine and even harder to proof and then these countries often have less than perfectly organized governments or don't even want their people back.

They often know where the arrivals come from, the issue is that the governments are often not cooperative and no pressure is applied to encourage cooperation. We don't want to become a dumping ground for the world for citizens countries don't want.

&gt;You can't change basic human rights and this is essentially a human rights issue.

Sure you can, they are laws too. 

&gt;I honestly think if say a person that would be genuinely in danger if deported couldn't go through the courts and ultimately stop deportation. And while the court case is pending deportation obviously also has to be halted. 

Sure but they could be detained while it's being processed. Also I think if someone as committed violent criminal acts we should deport them regardless. 

&gt;This is not as simple as just changing some law, at least not if you want something where nobody gets in. 

It really is. All of this is based off laws. 

&gt;I also don't think we internationally can afford the message that the west is abandoning human rights. We would just be empowering totalitarian states.

They are already empowered by the weak west with it's current migrant policy and foreign policy in general. We already saw that Turkey can just threaten to open the border and have the EU on it's knees. 

&gt;Sure it could. But it would also drive these countries away weakening our influence in the region longer term if we actually strongarm governments.

No it wouldn't. There is a reason Chinese, Turkish and Russian influence is on the rise. If you are willing to apply pressure you actually get a lot more than if you appear weak. 

The worst thing you can do is appear weak and easily played. Then your influence will decline because countries know they don't have to respect you.

5734,"&gt; First of all if you read your own post you were talking about the Prespa agreement in the section I quoted. It was elsewhere you were referring to 1945.

You are bad at reading comprehension, and therefore wrong. This is the last time I will correct you. http://prntscr.com/ueenb0

&gt;Yes, I'm aware. And in the context of this thread you have been ""correcting"" people calling themselves Macedonian saying they should be called ""North Macedonians what else?"". Unfortunately for you this thread is about North Macedonia. Not Greece. So in any justifiable reading this thread would fall under the North Macedonian context. So they would be correct to call themselves Macedonian. And you would be wrong to ""correct"" them.

Nice mental gymnastics. I wasn't saying they should call themselves ""North Macedonians"" within this thread. [I even explicitly said in a reply that North Macedonians, when talking to each other, should call each other just ""Macedonian"".](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ionf9o/happy_independence_day_north_macedonia/g4fkpky/) 

I was saying that in general, in real life, you have to give context, otherwise the word ""Macedonian"" is misleading. This is not controversial or disputable. **Even if** ""most people"" understand ""North Macedonia"" when told ""Macedonia"", this does not mean that there isn't another (historically tied, bigger and older no less) Macedonia in Greece that the word could potentially be referring to. That's why the word ""North"" is added there, **in order to give context, if context is missing**.  I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand.

&gt;I'm glad. I'm sure we agree that Alexander was an incredible general and an imperialist cunt, wouldn't want any revisionism about his brutality would we.

I love how you resort to mentioning all the horrible things Alexander did, in hopes of me renouncing the historicity of him and his ties to ancient Macedonia and her ties to modern Greece. LMAO nice try.

To answer properly, yes, Alexander was Macedonian, which in that context means from the Macedonian region of Greece, even if he killed many people.

&gt;I'm not Macedonian, not everyone you disagrees with you is a victim of nationalism or propaganda.

Actually, they are. There is only one historical truth and I am the only one (in this thread) who has backed it up. The phrase ""disagrees with you"" is weird.

You're right, it is also a matter of principle. Partition was a mistake, leaving many Irish people as second class citizens in an apartheid state. Now after decades of the troubles, and the effort that went into the GFA to stop the violence and open up the island, you casually want to put up a hard border, just so you can have Brexit. 

With all due respect, fuck you and fuck Brexit. We will make it as difficult for you as we possibly can, for as long as the risk of a hard border is on the table.

5894,"It's not actually *difficult* to make a gunbarrel, if all you want is for the gun to go ""bang"" and fling something against the target. However, gun barrels have to be strong enough to contain the pressure of the gunpowder igniting without rupturing - all the way from the chamber, down to the end of the barrel. 

Shotguns are the easiest ones to build since the only have to contain ~11000 to 13500 PSI (~750 to 930 bar). Something a decently made steel pipe should easily be able to handle.

For an AK we're talking about higher pressures. The ""classic"" AK47 uses a 7.62x39 mm cartridge, which reaches a chamber pressure of ~51500 PSI (~3550 bar). Fire that through a simple steel pipe, and you will most likely experience what best amounts to a pipe bomb going off next to you (and maybe in your hand, if you're holding the barrel in your hand). You can find pipes that will handle that pressure, but not in your local hardware store.

Let's assume you got a piece of pipe what could take the pressure of a 7.62x39 cartridge, and you even got lucky and found one that is 7-8 mm in inner diameter. You could make an AK with basic tooling, but it would be horribly inaccurate. Modern firearms fire bullets that are inherently unstable in flight. Bullets are heavier in the rear than in the front, and if you shoot then through a smooth barrel the bullet will begin to tumble through the air and fly in an unstable and unpredictable way. You could absolutely kill someone with it if they were close enough, but I wouldn't bet on being able to hit anything deliberately beyond maybe 10 meters. On top of that a tumbling bullet will lose momentum way faster than a usual, and not be able to penetrate a target nearly as well as a bullet fired from an ordinary barrel. To make the bullet accurate we need to stabilize the bullet to it will fly through the air with the - lighter - pointy end first and the heavier rear in-line with the path of flight. Stabilizing bullets is done by spinning them as they travel through the barrel. The standard spin rate in an AK47 barrel is 1:9.45 - meaning that the bullet will spin 1 time for every 9.45 inches it travels. The spin in introduced in the bullet by grooves inside the barrel, that will - simply put - scrape against the bullet and force it to follow the spin the grooves have. An AK47 has 4 barrel grooves.  
So, to stabilize the flying bullet you need to carve matching spinning grooves on the inside of the barrel, and those grooves must match each other with a high degree of precision. It's doable, but hard to do well, especially on pipes built to withstand high pressures.

Then we have to drill a hole hear the end of the barrel to use some of the gasses from the exploding gunpowder to push on the gas piston and cycle the action, and then we have to find some way of attaching the barrel to the receiver.

Lastly there's the consideration of longevity. Pushing a piece of metal through a piece of pipe that's actually a little bit too small requires a lot of force, and doing it over and over again will wear that pipe out quickly - especially if you do it so fast that the pipe doesn't have time to cool down between each piece of metal. Modern combat rifles are made to withstand that kind of abuse, but a home made barrel probably isn't.

A final note should probably be, that some gang *could* probably set up shop to make barrels that are ""good enough for gang use"", but I'm guessing it would be far easier to have a US-based associate order a stack of barrels over there (barrels are unrestricted in the US) and smuggle them over.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/ipbsui/hundreds_of_disguised_armed_police_raid_several/g4jhc93/,ScriptThat,1599655277
