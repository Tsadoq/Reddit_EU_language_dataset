11,"&gt;Seeing how things are going I don't think that will be happening for Turkey.

Don't worry we've been through worse. In 1990s we've had five economic crises in ten years. And despite that our GDP and GDP per capita kept growing during the same period.

&gt;Turkey literally controls the bosphorus. One of the most significant water routes in the entire world

Bosphorus connects Black Sea to Mediterranean Sea. For the central and east Turkey it has no meaning. Also look at the countries of Black Sea they're not exactly economic power houses. Bordering a country like China, Germany or USA etc. is much better than controlling Bosphorus for economic advantage.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_renewable_water_resources

&gt;Much more so than the vast majority of Europe, so yes you kind of are.

Looking at that wiki article is pointless. Half of that fresh water is probably accounted by Euphrates and Tigris which we have let flow downstream because Syria and Iraq needs that water. That list also doesn't take area and population into account. 

&gt;Greece is definitely much more mountainous

Ok. People dont naturally like someone with a better job. Like in cuba, doctors are piss poor and are unhappy as hell, a result being shortages of trained professionals. This refutes the claim of people striving for better social class. It is a strive for primarily more money.

Healthcare in the US is far better. All the surveys show subjective views of the health care recievers. US wait times are fast compared to the english and canadian wait times which are by far much longer. And US care is mich more effective. The only problem is cost.

62,"&gt;US; there are no black ghettos in European cities, nobody differentiates between black people and, say, Turks or Indians or Algiers or Vietnamese, and so on. Depending on the onlooker, either they are all seen as equal humans, or they are all shunned as ""foreigners"" regardless of their race, simply because they are different.

Remember, all people are equal but culture is not. Fgm is culturally important in africa and slavery is too. People from 3rd world countries usually arent the liberal thinker from a 1st world country. They must be integrated as fast as possible as to not let the turkish, muslim or asian ghettos form. 

&gt;And this is part of their genetic makeup and tradition that is passed on to even those descendants who are born on US soil? I would think this is a regional issue, not grounds for discriminating against people with a Mexican name.

Its their culture. How can you explain how it is in mexican communities? Its like new mexico in California. These places are incredibly poor. Surely progressive california cant be to blame?

&gt;don't think this is true. Racism may have been more socially acceptable back then, when egalitarianism was not yet as developed,

Egalitarianism is the opposite of freedom and im opposed to it. French egalitarianism shouldve been the last experiment with it. I dont like it as an american because it values the group above all else.

&gt;Just like at some point people stopped discriminating against the Irish, because they had white skin as well. Unlike those black folks! Surely those must be responsible for all the bad things

As an american conservative, i can tell you that the right is not racist. As of now. Maybe 50 years ago it was. But now its the left that is racist. The situation in europe is more nuanced i assume from the east to west. Look at MTV or any liberal site. Theres alot of stuff on how white people are to blame. If the same was said on minorities, there would be an uproar.

&gt;such as the frightening success of AfD in Germany), especially over the past five years or so.

The AFD is imo not right wing or conservative. They support state state run enterprise, privatisation of private sector and social programs. The only right wing stuff is anti immigrant. And their stances are pretty soft compared to US right wing policy which i consider to be weak. I mean i can see why the AFD is bad because i think its a left wing (compared to america) political party. 

&gt;or the rising popularity and normalization of far-right political forces in the western world

The left has run rampant, the result to the chaos which has been caused by the end pf religion , end of family unit and mass migration of 3rd world people is going to lead to fascism.

101,"&gt; A) no EU country is going to sit back and let russia bantantly attack one of its members wothout retaliation.

Only 2 EU countries can render military assistance. One you frequently tell to fuck off. So that leaves France. You're putting all your eggs on France going to war with a nuclear power over you? No two nuclear powers have ever gone to war with each other, why you think that would change? Because ROI is special and everyone loves you?

&gt;  B) There are 35 million people in america with irish heritage. If russia attacked, the american government would most definitely be pressured into taking some form of military action.

That's even more delusional than France coming to your aid. 

&gt; you’re the one acting as if nuking an unprotected country is just the done thing

No I'm not. I'm acting like ROI is powerless to stop it, because it is. I'm acting like if any country is going to be attacked in Europe ROI is a prime target. 

You're immature and delusional because you think ROI is so special that everyone will fall over themselves to declare war on a nuclear power for you. You've been blowing so much smoke up your own arses you have lost touch with reality. 

I give you that. The EU would apply sanctions. Apart from gas, because the EU needs gas. 

&gt;  Taking on an enemy country like the UK would be.

UK can defend itself, ROI can't. UK is a NATO country, ROI isn't. France would come to the UKs aid far more readily than it would ROI due to self interest.

102,"&gt;For crop researchers and scientists, the ruling is a big blow. While they will continue to do research on gene-edited crops in the lab, they argue that commercial and public support for the research will start to dry up, since no one wants to invest in crop research that will never make it to market.

I have a sneaking suspicion that forty years hence, people are going to be complaining about the deplorable state of biotechnology in the EU and trying to figure out how to expensively jump-start a nonexistent industry.

I mean, the last time there was a comparable jump in agriscience was, what, people figuring out how to use [artificial selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding) rather than just relying on natural selection?  Genetic engineering is the next step beyond that, and missing the boat on this seems to me to be pretty costly.

It means that every genetic improvement in agriculture in the EU must needs be (expensively) produced via artificial selection: you need the funds to grow tons and tons of something, then evaluate each, then choose it, and repeat.  [In all EU countries other than Ireland, Austria, and the UK](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/this-map-shows-how-much-each-country-spends-on-food/), at least 10% of household income goes to food.  That's a lot of resources and economic activity being tied up in food production.  The ability to cut into that would be awfully helpful.

Outside of computing-related areas, genetic engineering seems to me to be one of the most-obvious potential new [enabling technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_technology). While I suppose that that non-food applications make up some of this (e.g. I suppose it would be viable to do genetic engineering on, say, [French sugar beets used to produce biofuel](https://grist.org/article/biofuel-some-numbers/), I'd imagine that it makes it considerably harder to create centers of genetic engineering if you're denied a domestic market for your largest application today.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/92fvji/europe_applies_strict_regulations_to_crispr_crops/e3626rg/,vokegaf,1532746983

I’m extremely glad these barbaric practices are being dealt with, but if we ignore the “light forms” because they “aren’t as bad,” then we are just going to end up with those and more people ignorant to the fact that it’s still wrong because “at least it’s not the extreme form”.

I think people are more willing to talk about it on threads like these because they are constantly being told to shut up, because it’s not considered noteworthy by gentian mutilation activists, who should be backing them as well as from people who think it’s ok because it’s cultural or religious.

131,"I've made this shorter than before because honestly, and sorry I have to be blunt, you stuck your head in the sand. Everything I discussed and presented you just went behind this one very poor metric of orgasm difficulty. It’s not assessing pleasure as directly as possible, that would be touch and warmth sensitivity which I posted.

You said yourself this area is hard to study. The onus of proof is on those that want to cut to prove, and I do mean scientifically prove, that there is no detriment. But that is the standard that must be taken before we cut someone else's genitals. This isn't even close, this isn't even the start of it because it's not even directly related to sexual pleasure. That’s beside all the other issues that I listed, namely that all their rebuttals relied on a sole author who wants mandatory circumcision or the AAP which has been roundly criticized (as in by dozens of authors from around the world, many of whom sit on national medical boards). The proof must be the absolute highest quality, directly assessing, and the whole of medical literature must be agreed. This is not the case with circumcision. 

I gave a study that show the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis. Honestly you've ignored it. Along with the other two excellent presentations, also ignored. The study I linked shows the foreskin is undoubtedly erogenous tissue.  Based on this alone it is beyond me how anyone can think we're removing it will have no impact on sexual pleasure. The two presentations shows it’s a rather large amount at the size of an index card, the mechanical functions of the foreskin, and several other aspects.

Your next link is not related to sexual pleasure *at all*. Why did you even post it? It's about HPV, for which there is a vaccine which is more effective and less invasive.

I asked you to review those before we continue, and before you ask me to review any more of your papers. This goes both ways, if you want me to look at your information you have to look at the information I've given you.

162,"Are you the same seat belt guy? When a seat belt removes body parts please let me know. Otherwise the analogy doesn't hold. Plus that every single circumcision benefit has alternative (normal, really) treatments and preventions that are more effective and less invasive.

The stats are far from making this medically necessary. That is the standard to overrule someone's body autonomy. And when we're talking about surgery on someone's genitals, I say the scrutiny and certainty needs to be even higher. Circumcision is not effective against HPV and HIV, safe sex and condoms are. And they need to be used regardless of circumcision. And STIs are irrelevant to newborns, thus the decision can go to the patient to make his own informed choice. 

And sorry it's wrong to say that vast majority has failed to find detrimental effects (which btw is still the wrong way to look at it. The benefits alone must have medical necessity.). Some has found the foreskin to be very important. Some has found by *questionnaire* that *some* volunteers like the results. Some voluteers report harm. So the results are mixed at best.

And then we look at how well is this researched? How well does a 5 point questionnaire capture the complexity and nuance of sexual pleasure? How good is the data when it's 'mark 2 for ok, 3 for decent, 4 for pretty good,' etc. How are results affected when adult volunteers want a circumcision for a medical reason? What about when they are under intense social pressure to be circumcised? Religious pressure? Or the simple psychology that people tend to be happy with their decision whether it's good or bad?

I encourage you to read the actual studies, often the data is quite mixed but the conclusions like to round things.

I've given you plenty about the negatives and sorry to say again, you've ignored it.

268,"&gt;""Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a 'platform', claiming that they are tech companies and have no role themselves in regulating the content of their sites,"" the committee said.
&gt;
&gt;""They continually change what is and is not seen on their sites, based on algorithms and human intervention.
&gt;
&gt;""They reward what is most engaging, because engagement is part of their business model and their growth strategy. They have profited greatly by using this model.""

That is kind of missing the point.  The fact that social media organizations have broad goals for content (""whatever draws people"") doesn't really have much relevance to supporting an argument in having them self-censor.

If you're a newspaper, you intrinsically have editors, people there whose job it is to evaluate content.  Because of this ever-present involvement of human employees in evaluating all content, it makes sense to also attach responsibility to them — there isn't much overhead added.

If you're a postal service, you don't normally have someone open and read all letters mailed, because doing so would impose a great deal of overhead that isn't there.  Sure, you *could* do that.  But it'd impede the economy of the country, make communications more-expensive, and that's a pretty basic service that feeds into the cost of everything else.

So the legal model for the postal service — not responsible for the content that passes through their system — is different from that of the newspaper.

The argument from the committee is that social media is not *completely* agnostic as to content, therefore it makes sense to view it as a newspaper rather than a postal service.  While I agree that it is ""somewhere between the two"", I don't think that this is very convincing.  Sure, you have automated systems that fiddle with ranking, try to pick out spam, etc.  But the kind of censorship that they want is far more extensive than that — it requires human involvement.

I think that it's pretty safe to say that social media is far closer in cost structure to that of the postal service.  There is no meaningful per-human time normally spent by the company that grows linearly in the amount of content passing through the system — in that sense, it's even further down the ""facilitating cheap communication"" path than is the postal service, where a few cents of mail carrier time must be expended per letter mailed.

I think that having this form of cheap communication is probably, like the postal service, valuable.  Certainly the conversation that I'm having now could not happen without it.  Imagine if you had to *pay* all mods on Reddit…

And so I do not believe that it is in a country's interests to adopt the ""newspaper model"".

&gt;Increased regulation of social media sites would result in more work for organisations such as the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
&gt;
&gt;The committee suggested a levy on tech companies should fund the expanded responsibilities of the regulators.

That shouldn't really be relevant.  This is effectively just a tax on users, since social media companies will pass the costs on to their users, who will need pay them if they wish to consume social media.  In that only users bear the cost, I suppose that there are some benefits over a general tax — it eliminates an externality from choosing to use such a service.  But I think that having a tax at all is pretty questionable, due to the costs of losing cheap communication, which I highlighted above.

It also produces immediate and obvious enforcement issues.  Let's say that I ban some political content that I find objectionable.  Okay.  Now I can apply it to companies that operate in UK jurisdiction.  What about those elsewhere, where citizens might as-easily go?  If you limit companies under your control but fail to do so to others, you simply benefit companies not under your control.  Forums that users frequent for free dicussion on matters that are taboo — be it Stormfront for white nationalists, /d/ on 4chan for dickgirl afficianados, BDSM furry MUDs, or what-have-you — is not a new phenomenon.  People are clearly willing to take the very small hurdle of using a different URL to obtain content.

I do not believe that the UK will ever accept jurisdiction of foreign courts over its online services simply due to being Internet-accessible.  It isn't going to start executing people in the UK for blaspheming Allah.  And if it isn't, then the only viable mechanism becomes a Great Firewall of Britain, *a la* Russia and China, to block objectionable services.

Maybe in the long run, it *will* be normal for countries to establish such national firewalls.  But thus far, I'm not convinced that the case for it has been made.  And if you want this to be practical policy that isn't simply ignired, that's really what you're talking about.  That also probably entails doing the other unpleasantnesses that go with it, like doing a Russia-style crackdown on VPN providers, lest software companies simply provide easier-and-easier to deploy VPN packges.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/92hbww/fake_news_a_democratic_crisis_mps_warn/e35y1rz/,vokegaf,1532742145

&gt;According to the French national institute of statistics INSEE, the 2014 census counted nearly 6 million immigrants (foreign-born people) in France, representing 9.1% of the total population.[1][2] Eurostat estimated the foreign-born population to be 7.9 million, corresponding to 11.8% of the French population as of January 2016.[3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States

&gt;In absolute numbers, the United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country, with 47 million immigrants as of 2015.[1] This represents 19.1% of the 244 million international migrants worldwide, and 14.4% of the U.S. population.

293,"&gt;  And once the country becomes developed the nominal GDP catches up to the PPP GDP.

Seeing how things are going I don't think that will be happening for Turkey.

&gt; Turkey doesn't have any water routes either just like Greece.

Turkey literally controls the bosphorus. One of the most significant water routes in the entire world 

&gt; Turkey is definitely not a water rich country

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_renewable_water_resources

Much more so than the vast majority of Europe, so yes you kind of are. 

&gt; Turkey is the most mountainous country in Europe

Greece is definitely much more mountainous 

&gt; Actually until 1960 Turkish economy was doing pretty OK. It was doing better than countries like Portugal, Spain, Japan and it was on par with Greece in terms of GDP per capita (nominal). But then in 1960 we had a coup (organized by Turkish military officers trained in USA what a surprise /s) and military decided to fuck the economy up pretty badly. They basically closed all the businesses owned by foreigners. You can guess what happened to the economy next. And then Turkey never recovered because we had military coups in every 10 yeas. Coups happened in 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000. The Islamists like Erdogan gained power from those coups. Because NATO/USA loved using religion to fight communism and now we're stuck with Erdogan...

I've given all the stats which show the benefits are very small and do not constitute medical necessity, which is the level for overriding someone's body autonomy. Plus each and every benefit has a better, more effective, and less invasive method of achieving even better results.

To use your analogy, the rape victim lies about the whereabouts of another serial rapist because she likes that guy. That makes her unethical, regardless of whether it was or wasn't her fault she got raped. It is completely separate. 

Two crimes happened: One she has been a victim of, another she is withholding information of in order to protect a criminal due to her personal relation to that criminal.

391,"&gt; what determines your risk to getting sick

For some sicknesses, you can calculate the risk based on life decisions. For others, it's basically random. Either way, companies have algorithms in order to determine your risk factor.

&gt; you know your plan is going to kill people with chronic conditions/conditions from birth. people with diabetes type 1 will never be able to find cheap insurance.

Usually parent's health insurance covers their children as well, so if you have a child with a congenital disease, you can treat it. For all others, there can be a government health insurance program, say, like [CHIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Health_Insurance_Program). Also, claiming that ""my plan will kill people"" is ludicrous at best.

&gt; oh oh also did you ever hear about the phrase ""prevention is better than curing""

Yes I did. And, indeed, prevention is better than curing. But not when it's at other people's expense. 

&gt; you seem to base your ideology entirely on hate boners for junkies/smokers or other people you deem make ""bad life decisions""

No, I base my ideology on what's correct, not what feels warm and fuzzy inside. The kind of state-owned systems in existence today are basically redistributionist systems, that redistribute the insurance costs from high-risk people to low-risk people. If you haven't figured it out so far, I'm not a fan of this. I don't owe anybody other than my family anything above my civic duties of obeying the law and paying taxes, so I do not see how it is correct that I would be forced to incur costs for somebody else's bad life decisions. Or, for that matter, why anybody who made better life decisions should be forced to incur costs to pay for my bad decisions.

Oh, and before you start rambling about how I hate junkies/smokers, keep in mind that I was a smoker for 8 years and I know a person who is a junkie. So don't give me that cr*p, because I probably understand your motivations far better than you do mine. I concocted the junkie example simply because it's a know fact that heroin users tend to have higher rates of HIV and Hepatitis due to needle sharing, not because of some deep-seated hate for them. In fact, junkies are mostly irrelevant to me.

Just because the global temperature will rise by 1 Celsius, it doesn't mean that everywhere on earth will be +1. 

Think about it as the butterfly effect. Somewhere in the ocean, the temperature will rise by one, causing a massive hurricane. The hurricane will bring rain and cold, thus it can lower the temperature way past the supposed temp. Right now for some reason, Portugal has an average temperature of 20, yet north Russia and also North Europe are constantly reaching 28-35 for the 3 consecutive months. Even the rise of +1 somewhere on earth could cause it, due to cascade effect (somewhere temp raised by +1 could raise somewhere else by +5 or even +10) and that's why you don't fuck with nature.

399,"It's a nice sentiment but as a Finn, I think despite the vast similarities between the Nordic countries there would be factors that might make us worse off compared to EU. Norway, Denmark and Sweden have inherently much stronger and stable economies than Finland, and as such policies would likely be stronghanded to fit the needs of that core majority than to address best Finnish interests. Finland definitely has much less individual influence in the EU, but due to the inherently heterogenic nature of the union, there might be more room for more moderate policies that have less potential to screw with our position. Of course, the EU has its own risks along with it and arguably in larger quantities, so I wouldn't rule out a Nordic Union being a better alternative, although unrealistic. Now, when it comes to it existing within the EU, it could be a genuine option that could see everyone better off in some sense. Of course, NATO would likely pose a problem in a federalisation context. And, just in general, I feel sceptical of the prospect of federalisation of long established independent nation states. The Nordic countries are seen as very homogenous, but I'd actually argue that there is too much differences there to actually reach any tangible solution on that front.

Hard border was not considered before vote. Naive as it seems before, and many still agree now with this point, the border was wished away with a trade deal that was going to be so easy to get. Cause we buy so much from the EU  etc... 

I can't see how leaving makes sense without a hard border. 

I can't see how a hard border would work. This is before you consider the upset it would cause and the reality on the ground. Any infrastructure put up would be smashed down or blown up before it is finished. It would be never ending wall. The bill for it would not be worth it. 

Electronic border is a joke made up by idiots in London that do not understand NI and the border. On a normal border it would not work. On NI border it would be piss take.

I am now of the opinion that I rather stay in the EU as it is than leave. It appears to be the only solution that results in NI commitments being met. I don't think NI is ready for a UI. You also fall into a brexit situation: what does the fine detail mean. New flag, symbols etc... a completely new start or NI just becoming part of RoI as is? Would RoI be ready for it? Would the UK keep its symbols etc that have Ireland on it? 

When people realise the gap in health care I think they will think again. It's the day-to-day that will get people. Like education, roads. Come back to me with a firm plan and I'll tell you what I think of it. You need to also consider currency, there is no love of the Euro in NI and what RoI will give up. For example, would you give up Irish as the official state language? Cause that will be a hot potatoe. Joining the commonwealth? Having the Queen as Head of state? 

I think the only real solution is a confederation for Ireland that is all in the EU. RoI continue doing their thing, we continue doing ours. A joint committee of both discuss  all-ireland cooperation. 

Maybe the confederate Ireland I talk about would be seen as a stepping stone to full reunification. Another step in a Collin's like reunification.  It would have to happen slowly and money from Britain would have to back it up for many years. I think if things went too fast you would guarantee violence.

- PPP is more important when taking about quality of live in the country. Nominal is more important when thinking about purchases of internationally traded goods or about the wealth as a tourist abroad. It could be that Greece is still little richer than Turkey if GDP PPP is the same, but it means the difference is small. Total actual consumption index tells more about countries wealth. I think you are overestimating economic situation of Greeks and underestimating economy of Turkey.
- Greece benefited greatly from presence in the  EEC and now EU, and thus possibility of free trade with wealthy, fast growing western nations ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_economic_miracle ). Turkey was not in EEC. It's also further away geographically.
- Greece is closer than Turkey to the center of industrial heartland of Europe going from Manchester, London, Netherlands, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Switzerland to northern Italy. Countries close to that line are more likely to be integrated into highly efficient factory Europe. The integration means use of top management and technical processes - effectiveness.
- Greece is close to wealthy Italy, Turkey borders with relatively poor countries except of small Greece.

Le Pen was 2nd in 2017. Got beaten 66 to 34 (with no-votes : 44% Macron, 22% Le Pen, 34% no-vote, white or null), a lot of the opposition are still claiming he has no legitimacy because of big then no-votes were.

Only in a no tariff environment. In a tariff environment, UK suppliers are cheaper.

Here is an example using small numbers. Say a UK supplier can produce an item for £1, but the same item from continental Europe cost £0.95 pre referendum.

The change in the value of the pound after Brexit made the European item cost £1.09. So now it is cheaper to switch to the UK supplier. If there is no deal and there are tariffs of 10%, then that European item becomes £1.20. The UK supplier is still £1 and is even more attractive, so more British businesses switch to them.

So, the net effect is that European suppliers are being fired and British suppliers are landing the contracts. That boosts the British economy.

To explain: airlines in Denmark were paying their staff pretty hefty salaries. RyanAir comes in, goes ""Haha wow you vastly overestimated these people's market value"" and started paying them much less. The other airlines got pissed, but couldn't do that much about it because so many people were willing to work at RyanAir (y'know, because they were right). So instead they made a big PR campaign about how RyanAir was an awful evil company. The end result is that RyanAir left, Danish airlines continue paying hefty salaries, and it now costs twice as much to fly in Denmark as it does in any other EU country (I checked).

I might have left out some details, but that's about the gist of it.

Sources, please?

&gt; the discussion inside the Communist party as how to run the country are frequent and productive. 

Well, what matters is whether or not dissenting views are allowed to emerge and to steer policy. As I see it, China is a one-man rule.

&gt;Germany and Italy would gladly trade with Russia if it wasn't for the imposed sanctions

Of course, and it's worth noting that the normalisation of Russo-Western relations would prevent Russia from drifting into China's sphere of influence.

Allow me to expand my thought on China a bit more: It is instructive to follow the way it treats its neighbours, e.g. India, as well as its minorities. In the first case it uses its trade ties to bend its neighbours to its will and plans to selfishly exploit natural resources by e.g. diverting streams of water - such as the Brahmaputra river - to the detriment of its neighbours; while in the second it resorts to coercing minorities into renouncing their religious belief - as in the case of Muslims in western China - or to oppression - against Tibetans, for instance.

I'm not sure China's rule would be an improvement even though its efforts in the green energy sector are laudable. In my view, after Trumpism fades, the US will begin coming to its senses in this regard, but it surely has to confront its plutocratic structure so that a wiser ruling elite may emerge.",,/r/europe/comments/92aex4/almost_half_of_swedes_and_danes_would_prefer/e34suc7/,In_der_Tat,1532703989

794,"&gt; From a BBC report on male circumcision: Circumcision reduces the risk of developing urinary infections and cancer of the penis. ... Medical research in 2009 also showed that male circumcision reduced the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) which can cause genital warts in both sexes, as well as cervical cancer in women.

Who cares about what the BBC says? That's not a report, that's American propaganda.  

From another comment on the subject: 


&gt; UTI incidence does not seem to be lower in the United States, with high circumcision rates compared with Europe with low circumcision rates, and the AAP report suggests it will take ∼100 circumcisions to prevent 1 case of UTI. Using reasonable European estimates cited in the AAP report for the frequency of surgical and postoperative complications (∼2%), **for every 100 circumcisions, 1 case of UTI may be prevented at the cost of 2 cases of hemorrhage, infection, or, in rare instances, more severe outcomes or even death.** 

&gt; **It is remarkable that incidence rates of penile cancer in the United States, where ∼75% of the non-Jewish, non-Muslim male population is circumcised, are similar to rates in northern Europe, where #10% of the male population is circumcised.**

906,"That's not just Belgium, that's pretty much the way every regulator enforces the regulation at the moment. The reason for this is that if at any point in time, out of commercial considerations, you can reach certain service but not others (or only slower), this is a clear violation of Article 3(3) of [Regulation 2015/2120](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R2120) (the net neutrality regulation), which deals with technical discrimination of traffic. Regulators are practically required to intervene.

Article 3(3) also contains a general non-discrimination provision in its first sentence, and, taking the regulation as a whole, I think the only truly consistent reading of the Regulation is that price discrimination between content and applications is covered by this provision. However, in their [Implementation Guidelines](https://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/regulatory_best_practices/guidelines/6160-berec-guidelines-on-the-implementation-by-national-regulators-of-european-net-neutrality-rules) the national regulators don't view it this way.

According to the Guidelines, zero-rating *can be* a violation of Article 3(2), which outlaws contracts that violate the end-user rights defined in Article 3(1), which stipulates that ""[e]nd-users shall have the right to access and distribute information and content, use and provide applications and services [...] irrespective of the end-user’s or provider’s location or the location, origin or destination of the information, content, application or service, via their internet access service"". The evaluation of this is qualified in Recital 7, stating that ""the assessment of agreements and commercial practices should, inter alia, take into account the respective market positions of those providers of internet access services, and of the providers of content, applications and services, that are involved"".

This means that the national regulators have fairly wide discretion, at least if big players are involved (and lots of these zero-rating offers are from big mobile operators, zero-rating applications from the tech giants). It's that they *choose* not to do anything, probably not in small part due to the political influence that many ex-monopolists in the telecoms market still exert.",,/r/europe/comments/92ajil/in_the_light_of_the_recent_net_neutrality_stories/e34fn24/,sqrt7,1532689304

915,"Possibly the biggest global challenge to architecture today is sustainability. Sustainable design and management options are often neglected and considered of secondary importance.

After that architecture is facing an image crisis. Its historic role in defining civilisations, is being eroded by the burgeoning need for more collaborative relationships with other professionals including surveyors and technologists and a stronger commitment to architecture being of benefit to society. 

There is a need for architects to consider architecture as something other than a personal or practice output and more a part of a wider, more sustainable and holistic whole.

Construction technology relating to architecture is increasingly playing a key role in enabling the profession to meet such needs and architects need to constantly learn new skills in this area – particularly in terms of working within a common and increasingly open data environment.

You do realize that most of those countries, especially those with big cultural differences, have joined the EU pretty recently and to some extent after a period of little cultural freedom (Soviet period, Franco, Salazar et cetera)? It is far too early to say they will never overcome those differences. Do you think that New Englanders, Comanches,  cattle drivers in the west, the French-oriented people in Louisiana, Yankees in the NY area, cotton plantation holders in the south felt very alike in the US around say 1805?

&gt;This increasing dependence gives non-Western powers – especially China – leverage that can be used to prevent EU member states from taking tough positions or agreeing common positions with each other or with the United States.


The United States is also a foreign power that buys influence, just like China, why should we automatically agree with them?



Then the article goes on about Greece ""undermining"" Russia's sanctions. Again, aren't Russia's sanctions mostly imposed to the EU by a foreign power as a way to avoid stricter cooperation between EU-Russia?


It's a similar scenario as the Iran's sanctions: USA wants them and the EU doesn't, but in the end the EU will do nothing to defend the Iran deal, since the US already has plenty of leverage towards the EU.


TL:DR that article seem to come straight from Washington: basically they're worried that Europe will develop too close ties with ""non western"" powers and will side with them when it'll suits to Europe's wellbeing instead of bending over bacwards to Washington's demands even when doing so will damage EU's own interests.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/92aex4/almost_half_of_swedes_and_danes_would_prefer/e34fw5k/,Leisure_suit_guy,1532689749

1051,"Given that we're not even close to minimising what we're doing to the environment, and even further from reverting it, there is a need for extensive water filtration systems that can take seawater and create freshwater out of it and pump it inland.  Not only in Holland, we need it everywhere.

In regards to reverting the effect on the environment, we're maybe 200-300 years away from it, perhaps more, that is if we have the stability for that long to actually invest in trying to revert it.

If all the cars would be electric by 2050 (no chance, but let's assume), then we still have all the ships, where a single huge containership pollutes the same as a small country today, we also have all the airplanes, which is so massively polluting that a volcano in Iceland spewing ash all over europe in 2010 was the first carbon positive eruption ever because of the tiny part of the flights *just in europe* got stopped for a moment.

Then there's the industry, and there should be a push to convert any industry that burns things to switch to electric so that green options to create the electricity can be used.

Let's say all that happens in 2150 (no chance, but lets assume), that would still mean you're at ""0"", i.e. that's then without spewing ""extra"" material into the environment, but there's so much carbon and other gases been released that you're left with this huge buildup that will still be there.  We need solutions also to *remove* all those greenhouse gases.  As it's been more than 250 years since the industrial revolution, we will need more than that to filtrate the elements out of the air and oceans.

It has nothing to do with French or Morrocan. To put it simply, soldiers from the colonies were trained by french officers, followed french orders and belonged to the French army. It's safe to say they can be included in the discussion when tlaking about the French army.

1135,"**An Austrian court on Thursday found 17 members of Austria's far-right 'Identitarian Movement' (IBÖ) not guilty of charges of criminal association and hate speech.**

Ten prominent members of the group and seven other ""active sympathizers"" had gone on trial in the city of Graz earlier this month on charges connected to several of the group's stunts in recent years.

Being found guilty of criminal association would have posed a serious threat to the IBÖ's ability to continue operating.

Two of the accused were, however, found guilty on lesser charges.

One was convicted of bodily harm and coercion over an incident in June 2016 in which members stormed the stage during a talk on refugee policy at Klagenfurt University and unrolled banners reading ""Stop Immigration"" and ""Integration is a lie"".

The other was found guilty of criminal damage in a separate IBÖ stunt. Both were fined.

One of the IBÖ's leaders, Martin Sellner, was prevented from entering the UK in March, with authorities judging his presence would not have been ""conducive to the public good"".

In April he took part in an action near the French-Italian border in which far-right activists blocked a mountain pass in protest at the rise in migrants crossing the Alps.

Since late 2017, Austria has been governed by a coalition of the centre-right People's Party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) after both parties made a crackdown on immigration a centre-piece of their election platforms.

The FPÖ's leadership regularly condemns the actions of ""identitarian"" activists.

However, Austrian media have documented links between such activists and FPÖ members at a local level.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/92acj4/farright_austrian_identitarians_cleared_of_hate/e348nt8/,nibaneze,1532675322

1183,"**A significant proportion of Swedes and Danes would prefer to be part of a 'Nordic union' between Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland rather than the European Union, a new poll shows.**

The Sentio poll for left-wing Norwegian newspaper Klassekampen asked around 1,000 people in each of the three countries which kind of partnership they would prefer: the present situation with Sweden and Denmark in the EU (and Norway in the European Economic Area), or a new Nordic union with joint policy in many areas.

47 percent of Swedes and 45 percent of Danes polled said they would prefer the Nordic option, while only 32 percent of the former and 36 percent of the latter said they preferred the EU (the rest said they didn’t know).

Those polled in Norway were given a third option, owing to their unique situation among the three countries as non EU members.

More than half (52 percent) said they would continue with the country’s current level of partnership with the EU, while 31 percent opted for a Nordic union, and only 10 percent chose EU membership.

Despite their countries being part of the hypothetical Nordic union model used in the survey, Finns and Icelanders were not polled.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/92aex4/almost_half_of_swedes_and_danes_would_prefer/e348zta/,nibaneze,1532675919

You don't really 'win' in that situation and you may end up being marginalized and viewed with suspicion in a group that you can't easily leave. 

Not really worth it over the kind of discussion you probably won't have more than once or twice. I'm assuming 'average' religious people here, not genuine church-goers etc. They won't care if you're not very pious, but you'll get strange looks if you basically declare yourself as an outsider.

To a lot of them who take it seriously, they conclude that catholicism doesn’t save its followers - although most wouldn’t want to come out and say something that heavy. They’re also fairly often wary of catholic views of the saints and Mary.

I think it’s good that they take what they believe seriously and try to be versed in what it means. Calling them not Christian isn’t really helpful, though.

1234,"Many of rules &amp; regulations of Bible or Quran are actually common sense and have a quiet earthly background.  
For example Islam's ban of swine flesh. It makes sense when you see that pigs were often kept as ""the poor man's beef"" and basically raised in dark and dirty pigsties and fed on wastes, especially in cities. And if you ever went for a hunting license and (at least in some parts of Europe) had to learn a thing or two about ""diseases and parasites of wild animals"", half of which concern wild pigs and make the jump to human hosts easier than e.g. from roe to human then you understand it's actually a pretty reasonable restriction. Totally biased of course by someone growing up in a herder society where you have access to cattle, sheep, goats, camels, so not touching pigs comes easy. But reasonable nevertheless.  

The same is true for the veil. It makes sense in a society of mutually hostile tribes where women are lifestock and can (and will) be stolen by men of hostile tribes. It serves as some kind of protection because it makes singling out that pretty young girl harder - the kidnapper might end up with the girl's grandmother instead.  

But that justification should have no place in our society today, since kidnapping isn't tolerated and women and men are equals. So I think it sets a very bad sign towards where a person (or persons) want the society to move to. And if you followed that grooming gang affair in the UK you'll see that those criminals drew their ""legitimacy"" exactly from the presence (or absence) of a veil, dividing the girls into ""our pure girls, to-be-wives and mothers of Islamic heroes"" and ""sluts with no rights, ripe for the taking"".
 So even is only at the very periphery, veils are part of the culture that spawns abominations like grooming gangs. And for me, that is reason enough to fully support the ban of veils.",,/r/europe/comments/924jrp/denmark_bans_fullface_veils_dw_english/e344e1f/,RebbyLee,1532668470

Of couse it backfired and the rightwingers *were* proven correct, at least in this single point. but the left didn't take the hint, didn't return to the culture of discussion and discourse they were so known for in the 60s and 70s, but instead try to resort to newspeak, censorship, anti-rightwing paroles and a general denial that a problem even exists.

The Idea of that system was correct - only people did not delivered. So now we are throwing system through the window.

I do not believe what PiS is doing to be good - but at least they are actually trying to do something with that system.

Opposition offers only stagnation.

Judges could be independant if we could have them to be politically neutral. This is not the case in Poland so their independance in this case stands in opposition to democracy.

The TLDR is that protectionism can benefit the very specific jobs they are aimed at, but hurt everyone else by artificially  increasing prices and lowering competition. Meaning the net costs are nearly always a negative, and it would be better for those that cannot compete without protectionist laws to simply find other employment.

1396,"Not all religions are equal. They are probably equally stupid. But that’s besides the point.

Christianity in its current form is about happy hippie called Jesus. Sure the Old Testament has some awefull things. But again the general message is, follow the commandments.. Jesus is a peace loving hippie. Jesus tends to contradict the message of the old in many aspects. Its almost like a progressive 2.0 update back then. (Hopefully a third testament will come. All we need is a single line: Dont be a cunt: Credit Jim Jeffries). 

In any case.. god will sort us atheists out and put us in hell at the end of days, when the world ends, or if we die. So god is not calling on anyone to do anything pro-actively. I mean sure.. you get a few Christian nutters who might try move along the end of days, and get to heaven, by making sure the Jews are in the promised land and so on.. but generally Christians have no role to play in the Bible other than following a few arbitary commandments.

In contrast the Quran is shorter. It does not contradict itself constantly, like the Bible. The message is central. It talks about a warlord with many deaths to his name, called the prophet Mohammed. He calls for the spread of Islam and Islamic law around the world, by force and any means necessary in order to achieve eventual ‘peace’. So.. everything it talks about.. is an active religious following trying to eventually implement sharia law and indeed the Islamasation of the entire world. That is the central message.

Now many Muslims are very passive and frankly don’t follow he Quran much, and just call themselves Muslims for cultural sake. They grew up with western freedoms, and do not take their religion seriously. Nor do they understand it. Same way many christians, dont go to church.. But still have their weekly or Yearly church day.. Say they are christian, but for the most part cant be bothered. They just believe in some god in the sky they have not seen. Like a Santa Claus lie, they never grew out of.

 Fundamentalism on the other hand, is not ‘extremism’ fundamentalism is following what the religion actually says. A call for active islamasition of the world. A call for gods law to reign supreme, and direct actions by its followers to reach that state.

So forcing women to cover themselves is a small part of it. One that by fundamentally and verbally being against.. means the state, is putting its foot down.. the state is saying.. no.. our law superceeds what is written in a stupid ancient book. And if you want to be part of a progressive society you will accept it.

Country first, and religion second. God second. And these are the type of states we grow to love in freedoms. These are the type of states where religion becomes a little cultural ‘oh let’s have a beautiful church wedding’ embrace some culture... but we don’t pay too much attention to those moronic books. 

And that’s a good thing.

I could even go further and say a religion is not a problem, even in its fundamentalist form... If it is completely non-confrontational.

One example, is the Religion of Jane. These guys are so paranoid to kill any living creature, they will filter their water, for fear of swallowing a bug and killing it.. Or look at the floor constantly to make sure they dont step on any living creature. 

Such a religion does not need to be reigned in. Well I guess it might be a little bit over the top to the individuals mental health. But overall the Religion of Jane poses no existentialist threat to anyone else. And hence fundamentalism, is not really a problem, unless the fundamental aspects of certain religions can be violent and or oppresive. Forcing women to cover themselves through arbiatary religios laws.. Is indeed oppressive to women. If we can break these shackles more power to them.

1430,"&gt;It could be that we were all guided by Aristotle and Plato and sermon on the mount, and we've all read Shakespeare and Dante, studied Descartes and Kant, listened to Chopin and Bach.

I can safely tell you that very few Europeans are guided by Aristotle and Plato, primarily listen to classical music or studied Descrates and Kant to the point of inspiration, nor were any but a minority of Greeks guided by Aristole, Plato, or Germanics by Descrates and Kant in their own time, or all but the upper-class bourgeois who could listen to a performance by Chopin and Bach before Youtube and widespread records.

So it's definitely either the latter, or else the Racialist position that it was fundamentally European genetics, European blood, which served to produce a Kant or a Bach, and not the spontaneous emergence of a Kant and a Bach which informed European mentality culturally ( Because most Europeans would not be at all invested in any of these figures, especially in their own eras )",,/r/europe/comments/925zmz/discussion_is_european_your_primary_identity/e33r9ca/,Questiori,1532653837

Yes? When people who work are unable to rent a house for their family anywhere feasible, I'd say so.

&gt;because it deprives individuals of their free will by reducing them into mere manifestations of some collective forces and implying that they all have the same interests, goals and motivations. 

Individuals are stripped of their free will when a so called free economy system reveals itself to be highly feudalistic, and while everyone technically has a chance to move up and reach the upper classes in practice since the system relies on cheap labour and plenty of it, it will necessarily keep most people on the currently borderline unsustainably badly paid low-end jobs. In my opinion (as someone who stands to inherit a house), inheritance is not fair and does not make sense.

1499,"&gt;US isn't behaving like an ally right now, so purchases such as these would send the wrong signal.

I would say the same about europe as they have high tariffs on US goods. They also rely on the US for tech, medecine and services 


&gt;If a number of citizens is fine with low aspirations or simply doesn't want to do anything but a specific job that currently won't take them, and they voluntarily opt out of the labor market in exchange for basic subsistence, it also means the rest of the workforce will earn more money and/or better rights (simultaneously increasing the attractivity of said jobs, and improving the lifestyle of workers) as employees become more valuable.

Ok maybe in a fringe scenario someone will work very hard. But taking into consideration how people function, its bad. The welfare problem in the US is so costly already. And thats only a fraction of people on it. There simply isnt enough money. And giving money to people  is like subsidising a failing sector. Its going into the abyss. What do you think poor people do when they get money? They have higher concentrations of mental and physical stress. Drugs play a major factor. With a giant border next to the buggest drug smugglers in the world, i dont think anything good can come out of it.

 Compounding the other social programs and public sector unions that no doubt will come from a more left wing government, it will never work. And morally, it is wrong. Would you support your money going to people that dont want to work? If you offer people a comfortable life doing nothing and a hard path, i dont think its unreasonable to assume 30% of people will choose to stay home. No country can support that, especially not the US.


&gt;Ultimately, it just sounds like a bad situation; it brings me back to how wealthy the US actually are,

Like I said, the US is not gonna last. Its built on the premace of post ww2 growth imo. Where most of the world had their capabilities crushed. The US has a low avg IQ compared to europe, which goes a long way. But the culture of laissez faire in the US is what i believe to be the cause of most tech companies and innovation in every single field to be in the US. 

Most of the people in the US are dumb( from what ive seen) with 180 days of school and cheap everything, people are just lazy(compared to Nordic countries, germany and probably most of the world)

&gt;Nah, I was actually referring to same-race populations in less diverse countries. You have poverty somewhere in every nation, the only question is what part of the populace occupies this layer of society. And with humans having a tendency to categorize people as neatly labelled groups rather than individual beings, it's not too surprising that anything people may have a bias against may lead to disadvantages in life.

Name some clear racism in your country i guess? Or france? How about french racism? Or swedish? Black people do worse right? Can racisn be the only culprit?

&gt;And there's sentiments against people of Mexican heritage as well; do they just have a ""toxic culture"", too?

Yep. Election violence and dead politicians as well as wild corruption, the likes of never seen before are in mexico. Drug cartels arent fought and murder is high.

&gt; ""technically equal"" citizens such as Irish people.

There is documented racism to irish. But not in the present day. Look. Why werent there mainstream calls to end racism back then? Maybe because most people were racist. Today, in the west people arent racist. Thats why you jave majority support against racism and why the label is feared. Not because racists are hiding everywhere, its because they hardly exist anymore amd evwryone hates them. Its like saboteurs and wreckers in the societ union. When more than a million people are imprisoned or killed from charges of espionage, do you think those people actually were spies?

&gt; white people are either still looked up to and admired as successful and representative of a better world, or hated as the embodiment of exploitative colonialism. From what I understand, the latter is usually just attempts by populist politicians to mobilize the populace against a perceived enemy -- again the ""us vs them"" as a unifying force to deflect from other issues

I dont know the continent well but regardless of motives, its bad. 

&gt;This goes back to the continent's colonial history, and how corrupt governments perpetuate a desolate economy.

 I dont agree that a country's past should be used to judge its current position. Its like blaming everything on racism. Its not possible that racism is the cause of every hardship to africans. I also should add that the west is the only place where racial minorities live in peace.

The unique position of the UK is created by the four opt outs and the legal guarantee I mentioned above (though it's questionable if they'd get it after rejoining.) 

As for the opt outs themselves. Denmark (3) and Ierland (2) combined have one more opt out compared to the UK (4) though they overlap on AFSJ exclusion. Sweden has no opt outs since it is obliged to meet the eurozone once the criteria is met. The UK and Ierland are the only opt outs from Schengen. My understanding is that the UK wanted border control and Ierland wanted to keep the NI border open with the UK. There are currently only 3 countries left that are obliged to join Schengen. The UK and Ierland opt out of AFSJ on a case by case basis which you correctly pointed out is because of Schengen. Denmark has a full opt out, with the exception of Schengen visa rules, though if Denmark would fail to implement a Schengen measure it could end up being excluded from Schengen. Only Denmark has an opt out which the UK doesn't in it's exclusion from the CSDP.

1550,"&gt;Who's 3? If you're going to post Dacic propaganda that comes out as false time and time again, don't even waste my time.

Sao Tome and Principe. 

Liberia is still controversial, the FM revoked while the foreign ministry didn't. which is weird but that's why i didn't include it.

&gt;Egypt waited many years to keep up on Kosovo matters and recognized it after Brussels Agreement. Even before the party swap, Egypt was moving towards recognizing Kosovo. All here in the article. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt%E2%80%93Kosovo_relations

Moving towards doesn't mean recognizing for sure, the current President came to power in 2014, a bit after the Muslim Brotherhood government vocally recognized Kosovo.   

&gt;I'm not going to tell you about your country, but recognition is inevitable and Vucic already knows that. 

Why would it be inevitable? 

&gt;The population also stated they wouldn't go to war over Kosovo, and when the average Serb lives paycheck to paycheck like much of the balkans, the economic benefits of the EU will be more important than a lost territory.

We are doing fine, and the population doesn't have to go to war, we do have a professional army, we don't depend on conscripts. 
Besides, Kosovo doesn't even have an army, there wont be a war.

&gt;For example, strong support for a Kosovo Army instead of just a security force.

And that Army still isn't formed, curious.
Also theres [this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kosovo-army-idUSKBN16F1GE)  

&gt;hoped that Trump's America First policy meant pulling out of Kosovo and it turned out to be just the opposite.

He's doing exactly what he should be doing, cutting foreign aid and going for less extreme options such as  division instead of full recognition, Trump is way less pro-Kosovo than Obama, which is to be expected since we all know Trumps stance on Muslims.  

&gt;No, they didn't, they stated they won't recognize Kosovo until Serbia does.

Nope, they requested the EU remove Kosovo from the enlargement agenda, and forbid the EU to use 'state' to describe Kosovo, that's why we all were refered to as 'partners'. And they did say that an independent Kosovo will never join the EU. 

&gt;Unfortunately (for you) the geopolitics are not shifting, and the more time that passes the faster your population and relevance shrinks. 

Not really, our population is decreasing less than most neighboring states. And we're increasing both our military and diplomatic relevance.  

&gt; Serbs greatly overestimate their power, Serbia is not a powerful country even for Balkan standards. 

Right, but for Kosovo, it's a superpower. 

&gt;Your president even said the situation will be worse in some decades. That's why your government is scrambling hard.

He can say whatever he wants, the reality is that he needs to change the Constitution, which will never happen.

Simple, it's both. It's a cultural tradition (preceding the Islam, probably derived from Ancient Persia or Mesopotamia), which was sanctioned (but according to majority of interpretations, wasn't made obligatory) by a religion.

Plus to be honest, isn't religion a cultural invention anyway?

And in case of European Muslim women who wear it, it's usually religious (of course adhering to strict version of Islam AKA Salafism), as they are often either second, third generation (with their mothers not wearing it), or converts.

I'm not sure why this is the point you're focusing on. As I said, the expenditure spent on the Irish Defense Forces is going to be minuscule.

In what meaningful way would it increase? Presumably it would just be covered by the new reunified Irish government.

But this is not what he has done. The study has a very particular scope. He accounts for cost but as it purely relates to a Northern Irish context. That's the point of the study.

[The goat dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5sAAXRSwA) is performed on new year's eve. Basically, the man is bragging about how awesome his goat is (goats, in this vid), then the goat gets sick and in the end is cured and the dance starts with new vigor. Ye olde death-and-rebirth allegory, which is why it's done on new year's eve. Brings good luck in the following year to the families which it visits. Recently, in urban settings gypsy gangs have kinda gained a monopoly on it and use it to get money. Erroneously merged on wikipedia with kukeri, called [""mascati"" or ""mosi""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci9kijyaIzY) in Romania, which is another thing, meant to scare off evil spirits.

[The Caloian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSz2XBwU53k) is practiced in some parts of southern Romania in times of draught, to bring rain. A clay figurine is made and adorned with flowers, set on a ""coffin"" and marched in a funeral procession. At the end of the ritual, it is put on a small boat and set afloat. Probably a substitute sacrifice to appease the gods responsible for rain, or a ""death"" in the community to evoke the compassion of God.

[Paparuda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zizGXQpypc), rain dance performed by girls with skirts made of branches and flower crowns, while villagers throw water at them.

If you exaggerated with the previous two, there was a ritual involving spinning axes in the rain and throwing them into the ground while chanting to make it stop. Can't find any video on that.

[Weather forecast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwUPzpiZYVU) for the following year using onions is a thing in some villages.

[Calusari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd__YKv5TVI), ""the horsemen"", specific to southern Romania, ritual dances to bless or heal the host.

Yes, I am seriously claiming that. Your sense of holier-than-thou civility they are supposed to maintain when entering isn't an argument nor a prerequisite.

Those kind of proof are usless anyway, as you said it can be just a small percentaje of criers, don't they? Yet, haven't you heard about the aquarius boat? About the fact that Spain is the only country accepting them, probably creating a call effect that today's episode could be a demostration of? Have you heard any kind of oposition against the actual government actions from Spaniards? Aren't you surprised by the fact Spain is the only country without any strong oposition to imigration? If you don't want to believe it, fair with me, but just compare the Italian politicians and their public oposition to imigration, and the rise of the far right in mediterranean countries, with Spain's political acts. Or the borders shut down in the east when the migration crisis. Don't you see a slight difference?


If you want more journal articles about the eu critics you can find them yourself on google. The point is there is actually very little oposition towards imigrations in Melilla &amp; Ceuta in Spain because of these critics received from ONGs, european organisms, and our own politicaly interested citizen. And that those critics, lots of times acusations of a reminescence of our fascist pass, are the reason for the laxism within spanish inmigration policies.

1792,"&gt;He does make this assumption but not indefinitely. He also does not declare that the UK 'would' do anything. It could be argued 'that Britain should be liable for pension payments at least for a certain period of time. In particular, to the extent that pension payments benefit British dependents living in Northern Ireland (e.g. security and other services personnel), the British Treasury could be expected to take care of them.

Sure, the text says 'a certain period of time' and 'it could be argued', but the numbers say 'will' and 'forever'. The figures don't make any allowance for tailing off of payments, or the idea that the UK might tell NI to pay for their own pensions.

I made a mistake on NATO, forgot that Ireland are only PfP and EAPC members so aren't part of the 2% target. Still, his figures assume 0 additional expenditure, which means shutting down all NI military bases (without paying any of the newly unemployed people any benefits, and still collecting NI and income tax from them, an impressive trick by any standards)

&gt;Where does he make this assumption? I can't find it. Can you also elaborate on what you mean by 'GNI based payments'? The (pre unification) Irish budgetary commitment to the EU is around 2 billion euro

He removes NI's share of UK payments to the EU from the spending. In reality, NI's payments to the EU would increase, as they would no longer be covered by the UK rebate.

&gt; It does address this and it notes it as a shortcoming of the study

Do you not find it odd that every possible increase in costs or loss of revenue is either ignored outright or written off as 'a shortcoming of the study' while every avenue for a reduction of costs is included in the headline numbers? 

If this analysis was presented to me by an undergrad, I'd assume they ran out of time and give them a 3rd if I was feeling generous, but this is supposed to be a professional economist.

1872,"I shouldn't need a source when I state a simple fact everyone should know about the EU. Should I just post a link to the wikipedia page of the [European Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council) since you don't seem to know what it is? In the European Council, every member state has veto power on major issues like trade &amp; accession of new member states. The smallest member state (Malta) has 0.09% of the population. Therefore what I said was true and yet I got downvoted and insulted for it. If Serbia wants to join the EU and everyone but Malta supports it, they still cant join. If everyone but Malta wants a free trade agreement with the UK, that's still not enough to get it.

Even when the council uses Qualified Majority Voting (which is most of the time), it can be very undemocratic. To pass something it needs 55% of the member states (16) representing at least 65% of the population. Sounds a little undemocratic, but not too much, right? The problem is that [the smallest 13 member states have 8.37% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_population), and they can prevent you getting to the 55% of member states requirement. So even in the more democratic voting method the council uses, you can get 90% of the population and it's still not enough. And in practice these member states will prevent democratic reform of the EU as they will not want to give up their disproportionate power. It's not a mere theoretical issue that is unlikely to matter. The 4 largest states have 54% of the population but are only 14% of the member states so they really get screwed and have disproportionately little power.

In what kind of democracy do you allow something to be blocked when almost 90% support it? Even getting 60% to support something is difficult in a democracy. The European Commission (government) has 28 cabinet ministers, which have to be picked 1 per member state. So Malta currently controls the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries despite having 0.09% of the population. The UK only gets Security. In a normal government, there is a democratic mandate from parliament, and they pick whoever is best for each job with no restrictions based on what region they are from. The council is where the vast majority of the power in the EU lies, and there is little accountability to the people of the EU in it. In a national government the government is constantly under pressure from the opposition, and from a threat of collapse and new elections where people can replace them. It's very easy to replace a prime minister if they are unpopular. How do we replace Juncker? [He wasn't even wanted in the first place](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/27/eu-democratic-bandwagon-juncker-president-wanted). 

Then you have the European Parliament where Malta gets 11 times as many seats per capita as Germany. That's not democratic. In the UK there are some outlier seats with much smaller or larger populations, but the vast majority of seats have between 60,000 and 80,000 people.

Then there are the powers European member states have over foreign policy and immigration which can effect all other EU members. Malta legally has the power to give all 4 billion Asians citizenship, then they will be free to move to any other EU member state even if the 99.91% oppose it.",,/r/europe/comments/919lio/poland_the_effective_electoral_threshold_in_ep/e32v3o9/,pacifismisevil,1532625056

While they technically can unionize now, they're heavily repressed and their form of employment is used against them. Earlier this year LOT Polish Airlines pilots tried to organize a strike, the airline has refused, taken that to court and won. Unions have appealed and the court has finally taken pilots' side (that happened a few hours ago). This process was going on since early April I think. The airline has tried to intimidate pilots with legal action and force them to accept their refusal. The company's representative has mislead the court and lied about some important information that led to an unfavorable ruling for unions at first. They've recently fired cabin crew union representative because allegedly she called for violence in an e-mail sent to other members of the union. This met with a huge outrage as unions claimed that this was simply an excuse to let her go. LOT itself has stated that in their opinion unions don't represent interest of employees who work as contractors but only employees who work based on a contract of employment.

1952,"Watch out for the newly bred, mostly hybrids ones with high THC and low CBD profiles. 
Due to the current breeding trends, THC, the psychiactive component of the plant has increased many fold, while the CBD profile has decreased. 
While THC does have some medical benefits for certain cases, it can, especially at high dose or abuse, bring about paranoia, anxiety and panic attack. 

CBD has major health benefits and is good to balance out the THCs possible side effects. But as mentioned earlier, there has been a major shift in the THC and CBD profile.

Use CBD rich plant material with possibly lower levels if not minor amounts of THC (depending on the condition of course) 

THC especially if mixed with nicotine, can bring about heart rate increase which in turn panic attacks, for those who are prone to it.

It is a great medicine, but one has to know what and how it should be used, just like anything else, such as alcohol. 

For reference, I would advise people to look into studies, articles on it. It’s a magic, but it has its possible problems, like everything. As the saying goes: In small quantities medicine, in large poison (which is true for many many things, just think about water).

Wind and sun are not controllable energy sources -- and they are not even all that predictable.  That means we need *something* to even things out.  With really good long-distance cables, we can even some of it out with having to use energy storage.  We can use hydropower to compensate when wind and sun aren't enough -- and we can in some cases even pump the water backwards to store energy when we have a surplus.  This only works when you have big dams that are close enough (remember that cable thing?).  And there is nowhere enough energy storage in terms of elevated water for all of Europe.

For now, we still need to burn stuff to compensate when wind and sun aren't enough.

1993,"&gt; For your information, the Apponyi law (a disgusting xenophobic/racist piece of shit) alllowed the hungarian authorities to close any schools it wanted without requiring any explanation.

No, *it did not.

https://net.jogtar.hu/ezer-ev-torveny?docid=90700027.TV&amp;searchUrl=/ezer-ev-torvenyei%3Fpagenum%3D36

Here is the whole text of the law, point me where it is written that a school can be closed without explanation.

&gt; Which actually targeted the schools of ethnic minorities. In just a few years after the law was implemented around 1000 schools were closed.

So how comes in 1914 there were still 2578 Romanian first-language schools around, which is still 14% of all schools in the Kingdom? (16% of the population was Romanian.) Source: Zenobius Paclisanu, Hungary's struggle to annihilate its national minorities, Florida, 1985; pages 89-92

EDIT:

&gt; By 1917, 2,975 Romanian primary schools were closed.

Yeah, that seems some propaganda bullshit, considering the only source for it I could find is an admittedly politically biased book written in 1919, in the midst of the Romanian-Hungarian war.

&gt; was done exclusively in Hungarian for the first four years of education.

Now that is some quality bullshit. The law says, that it is required from schools that at the age of ten students shall be able to read, speak and count in Hungarian.

&amp;nbsp;

The only thing this model seems to imply is that the universe expands as usual, becomes too big, slows down and collapses due to gravitational attraction (which, by the way, I think is not proved to actually slow down the expansion of the universe at all, through modern observations), thus causing the Big Crunch, which in turn causes another Big Bang, recreating the universe.

&amp;nbsp;

First, nowhere does it say that the ""recreated"" universe goes along the same way as the previous one, so things aren't really expected to repeat all over again (I'm not sure if that's what you meant by having ""lived before"").

Second, assuming that it doesn't go exactly as the previous universe did, and that by ""lived before"" you are implying something akin to reincarnation, there is no guarantee that any life will exist in this universe; even if it does, it may not be sentient; even if it is, they're unlikely to be humans; and even if they are, they could be a whole different set of people than that of the previous universe.

In either case in which there are humans, they would just be separate people than us, even if the universe was repeating itself; there being another set of people after the universe is reborn does not in any way imply the previous people would be reincarnated into the new ones. That would require that you believe in reincarnation in the first place.

The model doesn't support anything equivalent to reincarnation, that belief is simply compatible with the model, not in any way required or implied.

2013,"Most of the time fascists exploit existing laws and institutions to rise to power, to then subvert those laws only for themselves from that positions of power. That's how you get a fascist state most of the time. 

""if the goal of anti-fascists is to terrorize the bourgeois middle class and force them to cling to strongmen to protect their property""

What

The mythical middle-class (ie workers who can get by under capitalism) isn't the bourgeoisie. The middle-class is not a group targeted by antifascists. 

And if anti-fascists make people vote for fascists, my guess is they weren't that far removed from them in the first place. 

What you're describing is how oppression keeps its power. Successful protest movements always had violent and non-violent sides for a diversity of tactics. One does not succeed without the other. Clutching your pearls and clinging to non-violence in the face of state violence like Jim Crow laws and the forceful removal of children from native culture isn't going to help you. Same with fascists nowadays. If just one side is prepared to use violence, that side will win. If that side takes power over the courts, you're not going to achieve anything. You have to actively oppose them. Hitler even admitted that the only thing that could've stopped his movement was if there was active violence against them from the very beginning. The only thing fascists understand is violent intimidation and if they're not the ones doing it but are the target they get incredibly scared. I personally am not made for violence, especially not against people who are capable of such brutal violence as fascists, so I focus on other things but support the ones who fight them. Make fascists scared again. Protect the minorities they target who have to deal with the rise of fascism immediately well before they take power.

2069,"&gt; But this explanation is hard to credit for one obvious reason: the current wave of “free speech” advocacy has coincided directly with the rise of social media, amateur publishing and the “citizen journalism” that is now possible at virtually zero cost. 

No, social media has risen a long time ago, not in the last 2-3 years. While amateur publishing and citizen journalism may have become a lot more popular in the last couple years, but it has been possible ""at virtually zero cost"" for a lot longer than that. 

&gt; The proliferation of platforms that grant anyone a public voice should, in principle, have put concerns about censorship to rest.

Not at all, the rise of this is not an argument that censorship doesnt exist. It was caused by the increase of censorship and the decrease of quality journalism. Just because people have more ways (internet) to get their voice out into the world, doesnt mean they arent being censored in other ways.

&gt; After all, even very bad writers with offensive opinions can now see their words published – or broadcast their voices via YouTube and podcasting. 

Well, thats becoming questionable, offensive content is being restricted, hence the whole issue of freedom of speech being restricted.

&gt; The more intriguing question is why free speech has become such a cherished value for conservatives.

This is very telling that only one side cares about this, is it because one side is more effected by censorship than the other?

&gt;Operating from the Romanian Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base near Constanta on the Black Sea coast, the RAF Typhoon’s responded to the suspected bomber aircraft heading west towards NATO airspace, according to a RAF press release.

&gt;The two Typhoon pilots from 135 Expeditionary Air Wing (EAW) acted in accordance with the NATO Enhanced Air Policing (eAP) mission the RAF is conducting in Romania.

&gt;“When we received the message to scramble, we sprinted to the jets with our engineers, fired up the aircraft and took off all within a matter of minutes. We were then vectored toward the unknown Russian aircraft who were close to infringing NATO airspace. The Russian aircraft did not enter NATO airspace so we were ordered to patrol the skies for a short period of time as a deterrent, until finally returning to MK Air Base,” said one of the pilots.

If you think that it isn't the case that higher salaries prevent employers from employing people then why not raise the minimum wage to $100 an hour? Why not $1000? After all, if employers still employ the same amount of people then won't everything be peachy?

Obviously higher salaries do preclude people whose skills aren't good enough from working. There are other factors that can mitigate or improve this, but that doesn't remove it. And being ahead like this isn't major considering how small the variance seems to be.

&gt;For Germany to even prosecute her repost under that law, much less with 6 years, she would need to have called for measures against a segment of the population.

You don't understand the first thing about how courts work do you ?

She is prosecuted for breaking that law. Maximum sentence is 5 years in germany. Prosecution doesn't decide whether to prosecute her for 5 years in jail or 6 or 2 or 1. The judge does that. Prosecution and defence make their case, the judge hands over the sentence which has to be at least minimum and less than a maximum. The women in Russia DID NOT get 6 years in jail. It's just the maximum of what a judge COULD give her. It is highly unlikely she'll receive the full sentence.

The neural network approach we have right now is great for pattern matching if you are able to train the system. As in you can create training data and can quantify if the output of your neural network is good or bad.

Thus AI can become great at finding out if there are birds in a picture and things like that.

When it comes to what the public understand as AI, and which is the holy grail of research, a way better term is AGI or Artificial General Intelligence.

2184,"&gt;Then it logically also includes its share of pension benefits. Those don't vanish. If they have to take up responsibility for past expenses, then they also get to benefit from past income.

Unspent past income, yes. The national insurance fund has about £25 billion in it, that would have to be divided if NI became independent.

&gt;Yes, and it's not because the pension fund was spent on other things that's it's not an asset that has been built up through contributions. If we two had a company and it needed to be split up, but I spent all the capital on hookers and booze, does that mean you get nothing? No, it means that I owe you half of those expenses that I made on my behalf. 

National insurance contributions have been spent on the things national insurance covers (pensions, benefits, the NHS etc). It hasn't been spent on booze and hookers.

&gt;The fact that I spent the money doesn't mean you're no longer entitled to it.

National insurance contributions have been spent on providing the benefits, pensions and NHS throughout the UK. NI has already had its share of NI payouts. 

&gt;now you have two people with exactly the same career but their pension liabilty is completely different, just because of where they coincidentally lived at the time of the split. That's nonsensical.

Why is it nonsensical? It's the only reasonable way to divide the pension liability.

Consider the same case where the second person remains living in the UK. Under your plan he would be paying towards the pension of the person in NI, but the person in NI would no longer be paying towards the pension of the person in the UK.

There would be 3 options if NI left the UK:

1. NI remains part of the UK pension system and continues paying in and receiving benefits.

2. The system is split. NI stops paying in and receiving benefits.

3. The system is partly split. NI stops paying in but continues receiving benefits. Everyone in the rest of the UK has to pay in extra to cover the benefits paid to NI.

Options 1 or 2 make sense. Option 3 is clearly nonsense, because it means some pay more so others don't have to pay at all. It's also impossible because the UK would simply refuse.

&gt;The part that leaves isn't entitled or obligated to anyting, that's correct.

OK, the UK could fund NI pensions by putting tolls on NI roads after it leaves the UK, and by charging people to use NI hospitals and schools.

Now that would be absurd. Independence means that assets have to be split. There's no way around that. And liabilities would have to be split as well.

&gt;If the UK wants to transfer pension liabilities for NI residents to NI, that's possible, but it will be an arbitrary distinction, and NI would be mad to accept that without also getting the money that was supposed to fund those pensions

The money to fund those pensions comes from taxpayers. NI would be getting the taxpayers. That's the point. 

And it wouldn't be a question of NI ""accepting"" anything. The UK would not pay NI pensions. It's as simple as that.

I'm not sure that the Republic telling NI pensioners that they wouldn't pay their pensions, and the UK saying they wouldn't either, is a way to win a reunification vote. 

&gt;since pension payouts are correlated with past contributions, not with current economic performance.

No, that's wrong. Eligibility is set by past contributions, the amount is determined by current (and predicted future) economic performance. Money paid by taxpayers this year pays for pensions this year. The money pensioners paid in the past has already been spent on previous pensions and benefits.

&gt;So you agree that the assets in the British treasury that were accumulated through pension contributions of these pensions need to follow the liability for the pensions?

Yes. The assets are about £25 billion. It's about 1 month of pensions and benefits.

The only way the split could work is for the assets and liabilities to be divided. NI would get its share of the assets, it would assume responsibility for paying the pensions, and would fund them through future payments, just as the UK does.

&gt;That's not the case: pension payouts are completely contingent on past contributions.

Eligibility for a pension is. The level of payout is determined by the government based on what it believes can be afforded in future. Note that the government can change the age at which you receive the pension as well, as many have already found to their cost.

Border control is a relatively recent thing, though. Passports only started to be enforced during the 1920s and all you needed to get to America was a boat ticket. So it idea that countries always had I tight control on immigration is just wrong. 

&gt;I thought we're talking about the EU?

Politicians in the EU constantly conflate them as well, with both often spinned as being the same, if anything even more so than they are in the USA. Indeed if you look at the Brexit debate you see immigrants from outside the EU (who aren’t subjected to freedom of movement) being brought up alongside ones from inside who are. Then we have seen parties like the Front National, AFD, PVV etc who use Islam as a shorthand for immigration in general, with some mainstream parties happy to pander to them and thus leading to stricter immigration policies. Trump is a good example because he is more clear while elsewhere it is common to hide behind a front in order to appear more respectable.

they were moving from one region of their country to another. the concept of legality is not some absolute truth and actually it is pretty new. people don't live (and especially not at that time) guided by it. 

your are trying to rationalise this question to some basic norms and laws but you can't do it, this is inherently wrong approach. you say that they are foreigners because your country considers them foreigners but this is not a point at all. 

this kind of questions don't exist in vacuum, of course there are no international law that obligate you to do anything, doesn't mean that your actions are correct. it's not that Estonian government was obligated to deprive them a right to have citizenship because of the fact that they were moving there during occupation term. they decided to do it, using this fact as a loophole.

2390,"&gt;I just have a problem with people jumping the border and staying in the USA illegally.

The difference between illegal and legal immigration is simply recognition. Also “boat people” are only part of the picture as many illegal immigrants come viva airplanes and plenty unknowingly come fowl of their visa requirements. Even then it is a pretty risky thing that people don’t take lightly, they know the risks yet decide it is better Many western countries have made it much harder to immigrate legally and much of the anti immigrant narratives are subjected to them. So I don’t buy that people are only worried about illegal immigrants as that clearly isn’t the case. Many people are clearly against immigration in general regardless of their status so I wish that people wouldn’t hide behind that line.

&gt;Except EU's approach to refugees is much more dangerous.

Who is to blame for that? It seems the problem is that politicians want to be seen as being tougher on it in order to appease anti immigrant sentiment. We have seen that many respected organ  get accused of being people trafficking even if they are clearly delivering them to the immigration centres. Australia approach has been rightfully criticised because it is inhuman and just because people aren’t dying doesn’t make it less so. 

The reason why Europe gets more asylum seekers than Australia is due to geography more than anything. Australia is surrounded by massive oceans while Europe is pretty close to quite a few war zones and so it is easier to get there. 2015 has also shown itself to be rather strange as the numbers of migrants trying to enter Europe has fallen down ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/91zt3e/german_employment_minister_bucks_europe_trend_and/e3224o4/,Auckland345,1532589940

2410,"&gt; And what else is supposed to happen?

Just like what have happened till today. Native ans indigenous languages to be the primary langauge in the ethnic republics aka native peoples' native land and federal organs.

&gt; I know it's a wet dream of NATO and western Europe for Russia to fall apart, but it's not going to happen, at least not in the following years.

Screw NATO. It's not about NATO or anything, nor Russian Federation will fall apart because it recognises rights of the natives and as we see, it hasn't felt apart for decades just because it happen to recognise this particular right of the natives. If you want to see Russian Federation fell apart, the way to go is oppressing natives and cutting off their rights or trying to assimilate them especially while openly showing the very intent.

&gt; It's as if some ""scientists"" were upset that Kashubian or Silesian isn't prime langauge in Polish schools where those languages are present.

You're free to demand rights for them mate, but neither these nations have their republics nor their cultural authonomy, or anything.

2440,"&gt;This has everything to do with autonomy. It's historically been the right of the autonomous republics to designate an official state language, for example the Republic of Tatarstan having Tatar as one of its official languages alongside Russian. 

This does not give them the right to force the teaching of their languages on those who don't want it. I believe in fact that such laws violate the [Constitution of Russia](http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-03.htm) (article 26).

&gt;Force a republic to devote more resources to teaching other regional languages - and to Russian for those that insist on it - will take away resources for teaching in the republic's other official languages, not to mention the overall level of the number of speakers of the language going down, further weakening the language in the republic.

The idea that one can't have the choice to learn in Russian in Russia is preposterous. Only by pretending that the current situation is in anyway normal could you consider such laws discriminatory. And your argument that this would somehow prevent the teaching of local language doesn't make sense since if there are fewer students learning the local language, fewer resources need to be spend on teaching it.

&gt;You don't have to outright ban something to do away with it. Chip away at something long enough, and it can become a hollow shell of itself existing only on paper. If you doubt this happens, go take a look at how protests are cracked down upon in Russia or how the public media has been captured by the Putin regime.

These measures don't in any way chip away at the teaching of local languages in any way. They simply the common sense and long established practice of people being able to choose their language of instruction. 

And the purpose of language is to be a means of communications. If people don't want to be educated in it, what's the point of forcing it upon them?",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/91t5rj/russian_lawmakers_move_ahead_with_controversial/e31xrs9/,GMantis,1532582840

""Meanwhile, the Europeans chose to maintain their tariffs at 10%. This move received the enthusiastic support of the European subsidiaries of the United States’s Big Three automobile manufacturers. Their European subsidiaries, mostly established in Germany, catered to the local market under the protection of the — GATT or WTO legal — EU tariff, which raised by 10% the cost of imported Japanese cars.""

2539,"Remarks by President Juncker:

&gt; Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, when I was invited by the President to the White House, I had one intention: I had the intention to make a deal today.  And we made a deal today.

&gt; We have identified a number of areas on which to work together.  Work towards zero tariffs on industrial goods.  And that was my main intention, to propose to come down to zero tariffs on industrial goods.

&gt; We’ve decided to strengthen our cooperation on energy.  The EU will build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas from the U.S.  This is also a message for others.

&gt; We agreed to establish a dialogue on standards.  As far as agriculture is concerned, the European Union can import more soybeans from the U.S., and it will be done.  And we also agreed to work together on the reform of the WTO.  This, of course, is on the understanding that as long as we are negotiating, unless one party would stop the negotiations, we will hold off further tariffs, and we will reassess existing tariffs on steel and aluminum.

&gt; This was a good, constructive meeting.  Thank you, Donald.  (Applause.)

Remarks by President Trump:

&gt; So we had a big day.  Very big.  We met right here at the White House to launch a new phase in the relationship between the United States and the European Union — a phase of close friendship; of strong trade relations in which both of us will win; of working better together for global security and prosperity; and of fighting jointly against terrorism.

&gt; The United States and the European Union together count for more than 830 million citizens and more than 50 percent of the global GDP.  In other words, together, we’re more than 50 percent of trade.  If we team up, we can make our planet a better, more secure, and more prosperous place.

&gt; Already today, the United States and the European Union have a $1 trillion bilateral trade relationship — the largest economic relationship anywhere in the world.  We want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all American and European citizens.

&gt; This is why we agreed today, first of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

&gt; We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans.  Soybeans is a big deal.  And the European Union is going to start, almost immediately, to buy a lot of soybeans — they’re a tremendous market — buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers in the Midwest, primarily.  So I thank you for that, Jean-Claude.

&gt; This will open markets for farmers and workers, increase investment, and lead to greater prosperity in both the United States and the European Union.  It will also make trade fairer and more reciprocal.  My favorite word: “reciprocal.”

&gt; Secondly, we agreed today to a strengthen and strengthening of our strategic cooperation with respect to energy.  The European Union wants to import more liquefied natural gas — LNG — from the United States, and they’re going to be a very, very big buyer.  We’re going to make it much easier for them, but they’re going to be a massive buyer of LNG, so they’ll be able to diversify their energy supply, which they want very much to do.  And we have plenty of it.

&gt; Thirdly, we agreed today to launch a close dialogue on standards, in order to ease trade, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs dramatically.

&gt; Fourthly, we agreed to join forces to protect American and European companies from better — and really better than ever — we’ve never done like we’re doing.  I can say, from the standpoint of the United States, we’ve never done this well, but we’re going to do a lot better after we do this deal and other deals that we’re currently working on.

&gt; Likewise, the European Union is going to do better, stronger, bigger.  We will therefore work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state-owned enterprises, and overcapacity.

&gt; We decided to set up immediately an Executive Working Group of very intelligent people on both sides.  They’ll be our closest advisors, and they’re going to carry out this joint agenda.  In addition, it will identify short-term measures to facilitate commercial exchanges and assess existing tariff measures and what we can do about that to the betterment of both.

&gt; While we are working on this, we will not go against the spirit of this agreement, unless either party terminates the negotiation.  So we’re starting the negotiation right now, but we know very much where it’s going.

&gt; We also will resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues, and we will resolve retaliatory tariffs.  We have some tariffs that are retaliatory.  And that will get resolved as part of what we’re doing.

So let me get this right, the EU ""conceded"" to build more LNG terminals ... which we were already doing.

To buy more soy ....  over which the EU has no control and which was going to happen on account of the cheaper market price due to the fall in chinese demand for them.

&gt;outrageous, or the idea of investing the money into improving the living conditions of the citizenry and less invalid. Especially when you consider this is just one of several projects of the military-industrial complex.

Ok the role of government is not to give money to citizens for free. Its like your argument for UBI. Why would people work hard if people are more or less guaranteed money for nothing. Enough money to live im assuming based on ur explanations.  Ok, then lobby your government to not buy a single plance, helicopter or gun from the US. 

&gt;I would rather think the cause of the price increase is lack of government regulation -- considering that it seems private educators have simply raised their prices to better fleece students who got money from the state

No because, private schools arent for average people. They are mostly rich or middle class kids who have enough money to pay or dont feel the sting of tuition.


&gt;By contrast, you've completely ignored the US Census Dept. data on the evolution of black vs white wages, even though I've called attention to it twice now. What gives?

 Drawing a line of best fit shows different trajectories. Of course people who live in a free open spciety all trend in a same direction, but i guess i am too zealous in my condemnations. 

&gt;It's not just racism (whose continued existence is pretty hard to deny

Its hard to prove. If you cite statistics of inequality, it isnt proof as they make their own choices. Also im assuming you mean african as they were the main oppressed group in a western nation. Africans show the same trends of less wealth. In their homeland the problem is much worse, and racism is difficult to blame for this.

I also present south africa. I think at this point whites are being oppressed, farm expropriation and black economic empowerment. Blacks still earn less than whites and asians in a majority black country.

This is idiotic. The US has stricter environmental regulations in some areas that Europe.

The US has stricter NOx emission requirements. That's the reason there aren't a lot of commercial diesel vehicles in the US - it's too hard to meet the standards. That's also the reason that the German diesels cheated.

2644,"You're not doing a great job at it. 

1) That study is off-topic. It deals with social trust while the article is about the political expressions of people about migrants. On the latter there are indications of contact with diversity lead to more open views towards diversity. [The latest Pew report on West-European Christians and their adherence to nativist views to is a good example.](https://imgur.com/a/uOqkvtN)

2) Posting lone studies is useless. Nobody should draw conclusions based on lone studies, and certainly not in the social sciences. If you want to ""cite the science"" on social trust, cite someone who has reviewed the literature.

&gt; Several conclusions emerged. First, in contrast to the
massive attention it has received, the relationship between ethnic
diversity and trust is rather weakly theorized, and various theoretical
conjectures are rarely tested empirically. Second, on the empirical side
of things, the-perhaps underwhelming.-conclusion is that no
consensus is reached as to whether ethnic diversity influences social
trust. That said, we believe it is fair to say that most evidence points
toward a negative relationship, but oftentimes without the desired
statistical certainty. Furthermore, systematic variations in the
relationship seem to exist across various features of studies. The
negative relationship seems to be more prevalent in the United States
than in other contexts, although this may also be due to greater
statistical power in studies from the former setting. Similarly, a
stronger negative relationship seems to emerge in smaller contextual
units that presumably better capture individuals~ everyday experiences
and thus more validly tests a frequently articulated mechanism linking
contextual diversity and trust. There is also evidence for various
factors moderating the relationship-most systematically, that of
interethnic contact.
In the second part of the chapter, we suggested-based on our
condensed review of the literature-a number of future directions for a
research agenda for the diversity-trust literature. Given the relatively
immature state of existing explanations for the relationship between
ethnic diversity and trust, further theoretical development and
derivation of observable implications of theories to enable empirical
testing are warranted. Relatedly, more systematic theorizing and
testing of plausible moderators, as well as a tighter correspondence
between conceptualization and measurement of context (residential or
otherwise), would also contribute to our understanding of when ethnic
diversity may (or may not) undermine trust. Finally, we concluded by
urging for a move toward employing research designs with greater
leverage for drawing causal inference. Fighting a war on many fronts
can be difficult, and as such, some scholarly division of labor is
probably the most realistic way forward in this regard.

2645,"It absolutely removes the context. That's the whole point. It doesn't matter if the context is tradition, culture, religion, parents wishes, future partner's wishes, social norms, social pressure, etc. The only thing that matters is medical necessity.

Even now you can read plenty of articles how some people think it should be permitted because of this reason or that reason, but when you take a step back and think through it like above you can really cut through all the BS.

As for why, I'll paraphrase Dr. Guests presentation on the cultural blind spot: circumcision is normal to ~~Western Society~~ the US. 'We're used to it, we're comfortable with it, it's actually expected, in short there is a huge cultural bias to accept circumcision. FGM strikes us very differently, most likely because it's simply not done in Western Society.' https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=1h13m57s

Even then you do see occasional attempts to ban circumcision. But this is quickly called anti-semitism. And after WW2 anything remotely resembling anti-Semitism was completely verboten. It comes up in various European countries every now and then, and the comparisons to the Nazis and Hitler takes less than a minute. It's an effective appeal to emotion. But you do see it now because we are getting further away from WW2 and a new generation doesn't feel hindered anymore.

I looked back at your original comment. What you see as an attack on Muslims and Jews I see very differently. I see it as a law protecting the child's rights and body. Just like the law on fgm, which is done under a combination of religion, culture, and tradition. One person's religious rights ends at another person's body.

If an adult wants to circumcise himself for his religion he is absolutely free to do so. He's free to practice his religion on himself, so I see no religious infringement.

I encourage you to watch Dr. Guests presentation above (the first 28 minutes are history which you can skip if you'd like).

The ancestors of the Slavs in Russia are the Rus, and they were not in these areas during these times. You rightly stated that they arrived at a much later time as conquerors and wiped the Khazars from existence. They didn't wipe the Bulgars... The Bulgars in the Volga are still surviving and they have a state now called Tatarstan (white Bulgars).

The black Bulgars killed themselves after they assimilated with the Slavs in the Balkans region. They created a great dynasty called Old Bulgaria, and then they destroyed themselves through integration. Now if you tell a Bulgarian that his ancestors were Turkic he will get triggered and claim that Bulgars were not a Turkic people but are 100% Slavic.

2695,"Yes, uncommon.

Taiga in the summer = swarms of biting insects + very remote (so: takes a long time to get to and get around in &amp; very expensive). This is something for intrepid outdoorsy types who want a really immersive nature experience.

I've been to Cypress Hills - it's quite nice, definitely recommended if you're in the area. Went as part of a roadtrip loop of the southern part of Western Canada - basically Canada #1 (grey) and the Yellowhead (red) [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowhead_Highway#/media/File:Yellowhead_route.png). I had never heard of Cypress Hills before arriving though, and have only heard it mentioned since in nature documentaries. It may be pretty popular in that region though - no idea.

Sounds like a cool trip - hope you have a great experience!

Edit - a bit of trivia for OP. The Yellowhead highway is named after an old fur trapper / trader / guide known as Tête Jaune for his blond hair.

2698,"&gt; Heres an idea, fund your military so it is a deterence. Its like atomic bpmbs. You prob dont need them but you having them prevents conflict.

Like I said previously, I agree on the principle (and not just for defense but also humanitarian intervention), I just think it's dangerously wasteful to *over*-fund it. In short, I think we disagree only on the numbers, not in general?

&gt; The f35 didnt cost a couple trillion dollars.

I just recalled [this article](http://time.com/money/4310099/f-35-budget-pay-free-college-student-loans/) -- though of course that's dated 2016, and it is only the loans. It is well possible that the statement is not entirely accurate anymore in that either the cost of the plane and/or tuition fees may have changed.

Still, that doesn't make the price sticker less outrageous, or the idea of investing the money into improving the living conditions of the citizenry and less invalid. Especially when you consider this is just one of several projects of the military-industrial complex.

&gt; And thats just the debt. Government interference with tuition.

Important detail: as the article notes, the increase is limited to subsidized loans and pell grants, the latter of which do not have to be repaid at all. But yes -- that there is an increase at all is fascinating (and means that it costs the government and thus the taxpayer more money).

I would rather think the cause of the price increase is lack of government regulation -- considering that it seems private educators have simply raised their prices to better fleece students who got money from the state. But what's the alternative here? Scaling back funding would forcefully lower demand, true, and thus likely force educators to lower their prices in order to sell all spots. But of course this would simultaneously make it harder for students to cough up the money on their own.

Let me present you with an alternative based on *more* government interference: https://www.study.eu/article/study-in-europe-for-free-or-low-tuition-fees

&gt; What question?

I was asking for your source on those numbers and whether it accounted for the inflation that happened during the time period. If not, a person with a ""rising"" wage might still end up with lower purchasing power.

It was more of an ""instinctive"" or ""reflexive"" query, though, as it would be a rather amateurish omission and I'd be surprised if it was made -- by now I have settled on a more promising argument on the subject. I should have probably brought that one up first; mea culpa.

&gt; We have blamed culture for the last 50 years. Its time for everyone to claim responsibility.

Technically, I'd agree, but I think people with more influence bear more responsibility than those who get ""swept up in the tide"", if you get my meaning.

It's not just racism (whose continued existence is *pretty* hard to deny, and I hope you would not try to do so), though; you have similar problems in other countries with poor districts, you don't need any black people for that. It just so happens that the US, owing to its history, has an entire demographic of people who (a) started out at the bottom just a couple generations ago and (b) are sufficiently distinct for some people to be biased against them, including employers [or law enforcement officers](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/08/home/rodney-report.html?mcubz=0), so it's probably an aggravating factor.

&gt; Ok this is all talking points. Give ne stats or anything factual. I did and you glossed over them.

I don't think providing a counter-analysis to your claim regarding the source of the wage gap is ""glossing over"". By contrast, you've completely ignored the US Census Dept. data on the evolution of black vs white wages, even though I've called attention to it twice now.

This is the formal announcement. There's no hard concessions in it.

The soybeans matter is a natural market consequence of the Chinese tariffs against US soybeans and the drastic price reduction that resulted ([article from one month ago](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/trade-spat-to-turn-u-s-into-top-soybean-supplier-to-eu-market)). The EU has essentially taken something that will happen anyway and framed it as a concession. It's a diplomatic move that is aimed to stall Trump by giving him an apparent victory while not doing anything.

The LNG matter is similar. Nothing changes. The driving factors for some EU countries to buy US LNG is to diversify from Russian gas. The plans have been in the works for years and are ongoing. Trump has nothing to do with the matter. It's again no change sold as a concession.

The EU and USA have agreed to work together against ""unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state-owned enterprises, and overcapacity"". This is clearly in the mutual interest (aimed against China) and no concession from either side.

Leaves the last matter: Working toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. That can really mean anything and nothing. It can hypothetically mean the EU will unilaterally drop all food standards, privatise healthcare, set tariffs to 0% and adopt the Imperial Sytem for better standardisation while the USA changes nothing. It can hypothetically mean the opposite. But there's no indication that the EU would not insist on the measures being essentially symmetrical. It can be a restart of TTIP negotiations without calling them TTIP. It can be some vague talks that break down in 3 days.

The only hard concession is that no side will raise tariffs during the talks. Which is a concession by Trump and a major victory for the EU against his ""smash everything up"" attitude",Yurop,/r/europe/comments/91vldq/us_secured_concessions_from_eu_to_avoid_trade_war/e31d8vw/,yuropman,1532560887

2856,"The thing you don't seem to be getting is that a large portion, if not the majority of actual Croatians, **do not want to unionize with the Bosnian Croats.** The only solution here would be that they get their own small country, which is not an improvement at all.  
  
&gt;So eventually a split would benefit Bosniaks too as they won't have to deal with keeping a country together.  
  
It wouldn't, how does a country split into two unconnected parts benefit from this at all. Another thing is that a lot of Bosniaks live in Croat parts of Bosnia too, and there are a lot of Croats that are not connected to the part that you think should be unionized as well. Splitting the country, even under peaceful terms would still result in a fuckton of a mess because the territory is not as organized as you think it is. Take another look at the map I linked earlier.  
  
&gt;All i see is pride and blind patriotism working for you. Just let it go man.  
  
You need those things when you're living in these parts. Being too open-minded about a touchy subject like this won't end well for you, lol.  
  
&gt;And this whole ""country we all share"" argument is complete bullshit. Your country is literally 20 years. It's not like there is any pride associated with being a Bosniak and stuff like this.  
  
Bosnia existed for centuries, actually, even holding large parts of Croatia and Serbia at the peak of its power. And for all of its existence it has been a shared-home to all ethnicities, it's nothing new.  
  
&gt;I get it was created within the old borders but still it's hard to create a modern and efficient country when you have such an ethinc clusterfuck especially if you're placed in balkans.  
  
That's just the situation that we're in, and the solutions to it are few, but splitting the country is not one of them. It will result in unnecessary divisions amongst the people and in the worst case scenario in more bloodshed. If fixing the country was that simple it would have been done a long time ago, but the only actual way to do it is if we share the same goals and unity, but for us it's easier to start wars than admit we're in this shit together.

&gt; The Nordic Passport Union was established in three stages. In 1952, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland agreed to abolish passports for travel between them and **to readmit citizens of other countries who had entered illegally into one of the four countries** from another. On 1 July 1954, the agreement was extended to allow citizens to reside and work in any of the four countries without a residence or work permit. Iceland implemented the agreement on 1 January 1966.[4][5] Passport checks for citizens of non-member countries at the borders between member countries were removed by a treaty between Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland signed on 12 July 1957 and which came into force on 1 May 1958. The treaty was extended to Iceland on 24 September 1965 and to the Faroe Islands on 1 January 1966. Greenland and Svalbard remain outside the passport union.

The climate people would be represented, the far left would have their party. On the right libertarians would have quite a big size and the nationalists would be represented. The overwhelming majority would probably vote for center right or center left parties. These groups can not be expected to be pushed into two parties. It just kill all dialogue. Center  people have no reason to take distance from Sanders/Trump, and instead support them for the 'greater good', so their side win at least.

3002,"&gt;No, because the labor market is a buyer's market: companies can actually opt not to hire, whereas they cannot opt not to work.

That doesn't mean it's a buyer's market, and depending on the skill you have it you can actually, as an individual, hold leverage on an entire company, depending on it's size.

&gt;Doesn't work if their disposable income is too low.

It doesn't matter if it's too low as long as it's fair to be that low.

&gt;In addition, that just underlines the problem: they already are contributing something to the business, their labor: why shouldn't they get to participate in the decision making just like other people who contribute capital?

Because the people who founded the company did not choose to make it so? Go ahead and found your own company where such a thing happens then.

&gt;Not possible without access to capital.

Capital is insanely cheap today which is driven by historically low interest rates and other instruments like crowd-funding. Today every half-arsed idea can find funding.

&gt;By definition that's only possible for a minority.

All of these strategies add up though. Only small minorities will ever accomplish each, but together they add up.

&gt;Proof: when minimum wage is raised, then everyone who gets that raise instead of being fired, was being paid less than what they were worth to the company.

That only proves that those workers were unable to properly negotiate their salaries in the first place. By your own argument the workers who were fired were actually being at the very least fairly paid and most likely overpaid. 

But in reality, when minimum wage goes up, the whole economic setting changes, and it probably just means that it's cheaper to keep some of the old ones than to fire them and hire new workers, even if they are now being overpaid.",The soon to be European Federation,/r/europe/comments/91k9fu/biggest_rise_in_uk_poverty_since_margaret/e30lzmy/,MLDdB,1532538133

In the early 1800s, when liberal capitalism was at its zenith in the UK, the standard of living was deplorable. The Irish famine has a partial blame on the government’s stance that “the market will sort it out”. It’s worth reading some Dickens to get a glimpse of how things were.

Over time the government intervened against the Capitalists, first curtailing child labour, funding primary education, etc (you can read about Lord Shaftesbury for some of the history). The Socialists won a major victory in the 1945 election, where they nationalised most infrastructure, industry and created services like the NHS, old age pensions, unemployment benefit, made things like university free and built tons of housing which cleared the slums.

As you can see, the British experience of Socialism was radically different from the Russian experience, and is why you see a lot of opposition for the politicians dismantling British Socialism.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/91k9fu/biggest_rise_in_uk_poverty_since_margaret/e30dc6k/,roodammy44,1532531237

3161,"&gt;You are conflating the legal structure of a pension with the practical management of pension funds. Legally, pensions are set up so the money you pay into them is the money you get back later in life. You may die before you see a penny, or you may live to be 100, it doesn't matter, you are legally guaranteed to receive funds based on what you put in.

That's not the case with the state pension. You are legally entitled to what the government decides. They can increase or reduce the pension at will. 

Pensioners in foreign countries who don't receive the increases UK pensioners get went to the ECHR over the issue. The ECHR ruled they had no case:

&gt;The Court did not consider that it sufficed for the applicants to
have paid National Insurance contributions in the United Kingdom
to place them in a relevantly similar position to all other
pensioners, regardless of their country of residence. Claiming the
contrary would be based on a misconception of the relationship
between National Insurance contributions and the State pension.
Unlike private pension schemes, National Insurance contributions
had no exclusive link to retirement pensions. Instead, they formed
a part of the revenue which paid for a whole range of social
security benefits, including incapacity benefits, maternity
allowances, widow’s benefits, bereavement benefits and the
National Health Service. The complex and interlocking system of
the benefits and taxation systems made it impossible to isolate the
payment of National Insurance contributions as a sufficient
ground for equating the position of pensioners who received uprating
and those, like the applicants, who did not.

The problem for people arguing about the UK continuing to pay the state pension for the people of NI is that they are arguing NI would remain entitled to access the UK benefits system after it has become part of the Republic and ceased paying taxes to the UK. It's a ridiculous position.

Rating those two people at the same level of poverty is 'absolute poverty' which is why it's meaningless. It's like saying ""Cheer up, the people in North Korea have it way worse than you!"" which is plain moronic and means nothing of value to the person being upset/sad/whatever.

3238,"&gt;I can't move to the UK at 65 and expect to be paid a pension just because of my age.

Of course not. Your state pension is the responsibility of the country in which you paid contributions.

But what happens if that country changes? The point is that NI is currently part of the UK, but if it becomes independent, or part of a united Ireland, then the obligations of state transfer with it. The UK doesn't remain responsible for NI when it becomes independent. 

&gt;That does not contradict that pension rights exist separately.

There's a few legal rulings that state they don't. But again the point is that the pensions obligations transfer to the new state NI is part of. 

&gt;But that's the same in both cases: you have someone with the right to a UK pension, who happens to reside in a foreign country. They just get paid all the same. Country of residence doesn't matter.

No, it doesn't. What matters is that the taxpayers who pay that pension have formed a new country and are no longer paying it. 

The other way to deal with this would be for NI to pay for UK pensions after independence. But that would be messy and needlessly complicated. 

&gt;You ignored my example of a person having multiple pensions from multiple countries.

It's irrelevant. It's not about the individual's right to a pension, it's about the state obligation to pay it. If NI becomes part of a new state, the state obligation transfers. Otherwise the taxpayers in the new state no longer have to pay pensions obligations, and those in the old state have to pay more.

How can it be fair that someone in NI ceases paying for pensions and someone in Wales has to pay more as a result?

&gt;If we apply your line of reasoning, then NI pensioners would simply need to reside in mainland UK for a while, and then move back, and you would keep paying them just like the UK pays any British pensioner in a foreign country.

No. It's not about where you reside. It's about where you have paid your contributions. People in NI have paid their contributions in NI, and if NI becomes part of a united Ireland, then the Irish government assumes those obligations. 

Can't you understand that if a territory transfers to a new state, the new state doesn't just get the assets, it gets the liabilities as well, and that includes pensions?

&gt; But if they just keep living there then they lose their pension? 

They don't lose their pension. Their pension entitlement transfers to the new state they are part of. The new state assumes the responsibility, just as it assumes the assets, and collects the taxes.

&gt;If the UK had a separate pension system and fund for NI, then you could have a point... but then that fund would be transferred along with the payment obligations.

The idea is the fund would be split and NI would receive its share of both the assets and liabilities. The problem is the fund only has enough money to last a month or two, so the state pension in NI would have to be funded by whatever state NI became part of.

&gt;Likewise, the UK has already received their benefit in the form of the tax contributions of the people who now are on pension age, during the time that they worked. 

Yes. But it's also been paying pensioners out of that money, including pensioners in NI. So NI has both paid in and drawn out its share. If it became independent, or joined the Republic, how could it cease paying in but continue to draw out? That would mean taxpayers in the rest of the UK would have to pay more so people in Ireland could pay less. That wouldn't be fair.

&gt;Either way, the UK already benefited from their part of the deal

And so has NI. That's the point. At any one time the position is up to date. People in the UK (inc NI) have paid in, and almost everything they have paid in has also been paid out, to people all over the UK, including NI. Independence would mean NI would cease paying in, and as there is no accumulated fund, they would have to cease drawing out as well. Otherwise they would get more than they paid in, and people in the rest of the UK would get less. 

You can't tax people in the UK for NI pensions if you don't also tax people in NI for UK pensions. ",,/r/europe/comments/91pe4c/department_accused_of_wanting_to_delay_report_on/e305fwf/,WhiteSatanicMills,1532523918

Also I agree that a flag should stand for the people, but sadly it is often the case that it stands for the state instead, and that's where burning a flag can easily be seen as a form of protest.

On a final note: given that the case we are actually talking about is progressives alternating a flag it should be noted that the flag of any state is often seen as a sign of nationalism, and I'm not talking about the form of nationalism which states that ""We as a people should have our own nation and state, as we want to rule ourselves!"" but the form of nationalism which goes along the lines of ""We are the best, fuck the other guys!"". That is a reactionary position and subsequently nothing progressives want to associate themselves with. As a social democrat myself I find the fact that many left leaning people don't like national symbols sad because while being left wing I still love my country and a flag or emblem is a prime example of something that could represent a nation as an ideal rather than the state in it's current form.

 And you shit on America, but I suspect you're the sort that thinks of the white racist-pandering republicans as practically blame free for the shoddy state of policy there, even though they've consistently voted against everything that would make America more comparable to Europe.

3330,"&gt; If the only reply you can muster is ""what"" to a statement like that then you should be embarassed. 

No, I honestly didn't understand what that sentence means. I'm sorry for your discomfort.

&gt;With a 98% rate of re-election, there’s less turnover in the House \[of Representatives\] than in the Supreme Soviet, and a seat in Congress is one of the most secure jobs in America.  
&gt;  
&gt;The US is still a democracy with free media. It certainly has its problems, but it is quite frankly idiotic to claim it is not a democracy because of it.

Yes, Reagan was right. Turnover itself doesn't define whether a country is democratic or not. This has a lot to do with political culture within a democracy and on the other hand, a lot with trust relationships in a dictatorship.

&gt; That's like saying a car is a plane because it can jump off a cliff and therefore fly for a few seconds and that it's idiotic to claim it's not a plane because you say so. 

Again, I don't understand those surreal analogies - most likely because I consider the logic behind them to be childish in nature.

&gt;How about you back your bullshit with facts? The facts are :  
&gt;  
&gt;voting barely changes anyone, congress is mostly the same people for decades

Why would I argue against that?

&gt;votes are manipulated via drawing voting lines, electors who can vote for whoever the fuck they want in the end

Why would I argue against that?

&gt;candidates are pushed by campaigns backed by lobbying money and media so unless you have the ton of money required to push yourself ahead any random citizen will never become a US senator or president

Why would I argue against that?

&gt; ""Free"" media in a capitalist society means nothing. The media is beholden to its employers and the agendas being pushed are very clear throughout the US.

The media is free because it is free to criticize each other...

&gt;Oh yeah? is that why the CIA removed the [Democratically Elected Prime Minister of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) and installed the Shah which favored US oil interests?

Now our country was in a pickle, because we had to provide something due to socialism promising that to young people.

3374,"That's because those forums are populated by conspiracy theory nutjobs and fueled by Russian propaganda. None of the things the USSR are did are remotely comparable to what the EU stands for. There is no big central fund, there are small contributions each nation makes to the budget of the EU, which then practically redistributes them among member states. How is that a planned economy? Structural funds are nothing more than a way to pump investments in lesser developed EU states in order to achieve convergence. And they work great. Lots of poor EE countries benefited tremendously thanks to them. Half of our new infrastructure is probably built out of those funds.

Big speeches are something all politicians do, so that's ridiculous to even point out.

There is not only one ideology allowed either. People can have any ideology they choose, there is absolutely nothing in the EU to stop people from believing whatever they want and voting accordingly. The only real condition is respecting EU rules. As long as a party does that, it doesn't matter what their ideology is. Which makes sense, considering countries joined voluntarily and signed the treaties they are supposed to respect and uphold. So if your ideology is to return to an absolutist monarchy, then that's fine, vote for your new King, nobody stopping you, but if your country suddenly dismantles its Constitution in order to install an absolute ruler, that will break the treaties you signed and you have no right to complain when the EU won't play ball with you anymore. So yeah, I suppose you are right in the sense that the only ""ideology"" allowed is a functioning democracy, and not any kind of form of government. However, inside that functioning democracy you can have left, right or any kind of party.

Though for instance in Slovenia black people were so rare that saying someone is black, means they've got black hair without identifying skin colour. Similarly red is a ginger and blue is a blonde. The word for dark-complexion-skinned is just that: *temnopolt*.

Sometimes I think the anglosphere underestimates just how rare foreigners settling in were (and are) in some parts. And generally I feel were as a nation far more xenophobic (rejecting anything foreign) then racist, it just happens that people most foreign to us also look the most different. Not that that is an apology. The fact is that geographical mobility for the average person was so low, people from neighbouring valleys were classed a foreigners. Seriously, a friend's grandma was known to me as the Foreign Woman and she was a Slovenian born from about 80 km away - then married into our town. Yugoslavia did move people around - cheap workers from poorer Republics - but they weren't dispersed, they were moved en mass to mining and industrial towns (literally there were government buses driving in with promise of housing and work on arrival) - most notable of which are Velenje and Jesenice. There the tensions are still pretty high and parts of the communities heavily separated. Especially Albanians and Albanian women specifically.

On the other hand, things have been changing quite rapidly now. Especially in Ljubljana and rural towns along the motorway axis,  since Ljubljana real-estate prices have sky-rocketed. On the bright side we do have a notable black guy in the country - [Peter Bossman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bossman) a Ghanian born mayor. But then again he is a physician from a well to do family and most of the workers from ex-Yu states aren't looking for construction jobs in foreign lands so that they could travel the World.

A wealth gap is a more likely cause of the decline in children in western countries. Not lack of religion.

If you did that then I'd be more likely to hear about your protest.

&gt;
&gt;* Gandhi's Salt March, 1930 (arguably)

None of those are normal behaviour.

People arent just born poor and stay poor. There is alot of wealth mobility in america. I like to see it as that the US is friendly individualism and successful individuals by compounding effort and success to more success and oppurtunity.

&gt;Black income was rising in 1940 because the education gap between blacks and whites was decreased. For the latter decades, I'd like you to take a look at this chart

You said the reason black income was low was recession. But now you change the argument to whether it is stable? I think. Idk if thats ur argument. Im talking about the fact it is so much lower, i brought up failure of the black family

http://thebullelephant.com/what-do-all-the-mass-shooters-have-in-common-no-father-in-the-home/

&gt;Ah, gotcha. Well, back then it was the Cold War, which was a matter of polarized ideologies. Today, however, neither China nor Russia seek to export their culture. There is no ""world revolution"" going on, 

Like i said, it might not be for now but the chinese empire collapsed and had a nationalist government then an invasian and communism. Thats rapid change. It was also expected that japanese would lose to the chinese army. Look, im saying things arent going to always be like how it is now. Its impossible that it will stay the same. Given how many factors are in play and the sheer amount of time that needs to pass before the earth is annihilated by the sun should suggest that things will change by the times its 2 billion and 2018. Right?

&gt;So in short: no, it wasn't Obama at all. Please do not re-interpret calls for less police brutality into an order to de-police problem districts.

As a classic trumptard, i might blame obama for too much. But i will say that the media supports him and he could have started a precedent. He did start one where the president talked about race in the office. At first, even liberal putlets were confused or mad but then now its mainstream. You can attribute racialization to Obama or the media. Im not sure if obama played that big of a role or if he didnt at all. Im bringing this up because obama can clearly influence culture in nassive ways and he might have with this police shooting stuff. 


Also, im going to rant. The media want to fit a narrative through reporting. They reported on criminals, Trayvon Martin and ""Hands up dont shoot"" michael brown in overwhelmingly positive light. Even lying about what happened. While tens of thousands of blacks die from black on black crime, the media focuses on mostly justified shootings by police. My point is that people have a hard time admitting guilt. Its up to loving and caring 3rd party sources to call us out on our shit. Its like the relationship between you and god. God loves you, but you are not perfect. God tells you what ways to change. But in todays world, its hateful to say blacka have a violence problem or that they have a gang problem. Its hurting them.

3757,"&gt; What random 'rescue' worker.. We have not accepted Turkish aid. 

Exactly, *those* firemen and rescue workers. The ones you didn't accept because you're so hung up on the Turkish government's [legitimate] assholery that you can't even let some Turkish guy risk his own life to help save fellow Greeks. Fighting huge fires is no simple task, they could literally die on Greek soil saving Greek lives and you don't want to give them the chance because Erdogan is a jerk???

There is no question that Erdogan is a jerk. One of the most vile leaders in the world today. His rhetoric about taking back islands that have been Greek for centuries and rebuilding the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, his kidnapping of the two Greek soldiers, the literal dozens of daily air space violations for years -- just a few months ago he had his security guards beat the hell out of American protestors in Washington, DC -- I know that he's a horrible person, verging on a dictator. 

&gt; Ill bet you are American. 

Yes, and intimately aware of what it is like to be judged for the shitty government you have no power to stop and the minority of vocal assholes in my country. There are millions of Turks who hate Erdogan, and millions more who want to help their neighbors in this time of disaster. I'd be willing to bet the Turk who volunteers to fly 500 miles to fight a firestorm is probably one of them.

3799,"&gt; Erdogan is not a one man show. 

Yes and no. Isn't the AKP basically a cult of Erdogan now? He's fundamentally changed the entire landscape of Turkey.

&gt; Trump has created a negative image for the USA internationally too. Although even he is not close to the military bully Erdogan is.

I think both of them are simply making threats to appease their chickenhawk voters. But certainly, Trump routinely threatens other nations too. Don't you remember when he threatened to annihilate North Korea via tweet (before deciding he was buddies with Kim). *Fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen!!!* Just yesterday he threaten to obliterate all of Iran in all caps like an angry child. And his advisors, especially Bolton, are just as crazy as he is. Trump could easily start a major war that sets the entire Middle East on fire and draws Israel, Saudi Arabia, NATO, and Russia into it.

&gt; But I need only turn on Fox News, to see the engrained American sentiment of a very large part of the population, sharing trumps ideology and very proud of him.

I live in a rural part of a southern state, I am very well aware of this. My entire point was that you can look at my state and see the xenophobes and jingoists and proud Trump-fans who are obsessed with gays and immigrants, and just assume that we're all assholes. Actually most of those guys are decent people who care about others, they are simply misguided politically IMHO. And even in my state, they are less than half of the population. If one of my neighbors volunteers to fly to another country and risk his life fighting a forest fire, you can bet he's a good man. It'd be silly to reject him because Trump won his county and maybe he supports him.

Same goes for any Turk willing to parachute into a firestorm. Maybe that guy hates Erdogan, maybe he supports him, but if he's willing to volunteer for something so crazy to save Greeks he must be a decent guy. 

&gt; Even in the better periods of Greco-turkish relations...

True. But the governments will always be antagonistic. Always. If you only look at the behavior of the Turkish government you'll die an old man still hating the Turks.

""The [European Emergency Response Capacity](http://ec.europa.eu/echo/what-we-do/civil-protection/european-emergency-response-capacity_en) consists of a voluntary pool of resources for emergency response, which are pre-committed by the countries participating in the Mechanism. The voluntary pool allows for a more predictable, faster and reliable EU response to disasters. It is also intended to facilitate better planning and coordination at European and national levels. The European Medical Corps is part of the EERC""

It's not like poland hade 4 modules (280 men) on standby just waiting to go anywhere in the world. I doubt they even where registered in the voluntary pool to begin with.

For example when Sweden requested help from the Civil protection mechanism , The Polish Gouverment sent an offer to the Swedish gouvment directly, which they in accepted.  Poland was not obliged to send any help and absolutly not 140 men and 44 trucks.  For example Germany didn't even send half of that and they are as close to sweden as Poland. and like double the size of Poland.

The reason Poland send help is beacouse they have experience from wildfires and a good equipt fire force, they helpt Russia for example in 2010 or 2011 dont remember. Poland also have a lot of forest and  had like 6000 wildfires this year.

And i hope your kidding when you say Poland is nearby Greece?  and what do you mean Poland is not the good guys , These firemen left their families to risk their life in other countries.

3919,"First of all the area of today's Israel was under Ottoman rule for a long ass time and afterwards under British rule. The land was heavily inhabited by both jews and arabs. The arabs rebelled against the British in 1936 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939\_Arab\_revolt\_in\_Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine)) and after this revolt the Brits decided it would be a good idea to set up two states in the area, one for the jews and one for the arabs. However, the share was not that fair as 80% of the land would go to the arabs and the rest 20% to the jews. The jews accepted this offer even if it was bad for them and the arabs REJECTED. You heard that right.

The 1947 UN proposal ([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/UN\_Palestine\_Partition\_Versions\_1947.jpg/800px-UN\_Palestine\_Partition\_Versions\_1947.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/UN_Palestine_Partition_Versions_1947.jpg/800px-UN_Palestine_Partition_Versions_1947.jpg)) was also good, for both the jews and the muslims living on that land. A fair partition of the land, the jews accepted the offer, while the arabs not only refused, but also launched what is known as the 1948 Arab-Israeli war ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948\_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli\_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War)) which of course Israel won and took over some arab territories. You launch a war, you lose, what you expect? Of course Israel took some land, they took the Gaza strip and the West Bank was under Jordan.

Going foward, 1967, the arab nations around Israel united and launched an attack on Israel and what happened became known as The Six Day War ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day\_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War)). The arabs again, LOST and as a result Israel now had under its land both the West Bank and Gaza strip. Israel thought of either giving the West Bank back to Jordan and the Gaza strip to Egypt or making a Palestinian state. But the Arab League decided that they want no peace with Israel at the meeting of Sudan ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967\_Arab\_League\_summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Arab_League_summit)).

Let's move even more. In 2000 Israel tried again to find a way to get the Palestinians to accept a two state solution at the 2000 Camp David Summit ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000\_Camp\_David\_Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit)) where Palestinians again reject a proposal for an official recognised state with Gaza Strip and West bank as territory with East Jerusalem as capital. The arabs refused again and refused again in 2008 a similar offer.

Meanwhile during all these years, arabs launched intifadas and multiple attacks on Israel while Israel was trying to find a peaceful solution. These days they blow up in buses full of kids and stab soldiers around Jerusalem. Not good, not good.

I spoke with facts and sources, you posted a picture that makes no sense and has no ties to the real history of the area. I am not trying to act like a smart ass but I used to be like you, till I actually started learning. Knowledge is power and it allows you to not be manipulated. As a Turk it's natural you want to support muslims in this conflict, but the terrorists you support are the ones that are causing problems since so many fucking years and don't want to find a peaceful solution.

In a forum in Paris - Today in France, three MEPs are mobilising for a better treatment of family affairs.

Emmanuel Maurel (PS), Virginie Rozière (RG) and Edouard Martin (PS), MEPs

Hundreds of our compatriots have lost custody of their children born of a Franco-German union, for the sole reason that they are not German. The German courts tend to give victory to the German who disputes custody of the child to a Frenchman. In the case of a cross-border dispute, the verdict is the same: regardless of the child's habitual place of residence, the child of a binational couple must remain (or return) to German soil in order to protect his or her ""best interests"".

It is the Jugendamt, the German Youth Office, which ensures that this rule is inviolable. The Jugendamt, the children's lawyer, has a budget of €35 billion and is responsible for paying family allowances and intervening in cases of legal separation with children. Its organisation is very decentralised and at the same time it is a real institution, a State within the State, which is also called ""the third parent"". He advises the courts, which follow his advice, convinced that Germany is the best place in the world to raise children.

This is how French parents are deemed unfit to educate their children. This is how French fathers and mothers lose all rights over them and find themselves definitively separated, even though French court judgments claim the opposite. Boring at a time when the creation of a European Public Prosecutor is being considered and when national judges must trust each other. Most cases of so-called ""stolen"" children are Franco-German, but they are also Polish, Swedish, Italian... Thousands of European parents are victims of this discrimination.

Between 2007 and 2018, the European Parliament received more than 300 petitions denouncing these practices, although family law does not fall within the EU's competence and the Commission refuses any ""interference"" in national affairs. However, there is a 2003 regulation on cross-border matrimonial disputes and parental responsibility, but it specifies that the latter is determined by the law of the child's country of residence. In so doing, European legislation distracts from the concrete practice of the courts and the Jugendamt himself.

Beyond the ""national versus Community competences"" debate, how can such a unilateral vision of the best interests of the child be accepted? Binational couples are numerous - nearly 14% of French marriages are mixed and among them European binational couples are constantly increasing. This is one of the positive results of the free movement of persons. By abolishing borders, the European Union makes it possible to love. But if love is allowed, the resulting separations are not sufficiently framed. Because of the Jugendamt and the European inaction, hundreds of couples thus separate in injustice - and in ruin: not only is the German administrative-judicial procedure infinitely more complex than ours, but it is also exclusively formulated in German and above all... very expensive. Registration and attorney fees can quickly exceed several tens of thousands of euros. Flouting with impunity two fundamental principles of the Union - non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and the free movement of persons - Germany exposes European citizens to the most cruel injustice: being permanently separated from a child.

Europe must promote minimum coordination between the various national family laws, if only to avoid situations as Kafkaesque as those created by the Jugendamt, and be more interested in children from European binational couples. It is up to Europe to act, by upholding its principles and creating the conditions for a genuine right to a fair trial in family matters in Germany and throughout Europe. As representatives of the citizens, we MEPs refuse to be complicit in such a situation.",,/r/europe/comments/91mh5s/binational_couples_most_cases_of_socalled_stolen/e2z483q/,sektabox,1532474380

This ""great profit"" is *why* the US has so much medical innovation.

As a result of that medical research gets done. If medical research is not as profitable then investors won't invest in medical research and less medical research gets done.

Over time? No. No you can't. The incentives for private sector companies vs public sector companies is different.

There is always a large increase in fear whenever there is a story about Russian aggression into Sweden and calls to join NATO follows, so it's very obviously driving Sweden towards NATO and not away.

 The best thing for Russia would be to increase trade relations because that would have the affect of us moving away from NATO to keep the trade, this is why many in Finland are against NATO because Finland trades a lot with Russia.

It's utterly baffling to me why Russia does not realise this. Can anyone give any input on why they would think in this way?

If you are an employee in a private business then it's in the best interests of the business owner to structure your income in a way where if you do a great job then you get more income. Money is necessary to live a good life and have happiness.

If the government runs a business, then the same still basic factor still applies to the people working there. The difference is that a government bureaucrat does not have an incentive to have the business perform well. They want to keep being paid, so their #1 priority is to make sure they don't get fired. The best way to avoid being fired is by not making mistakes, even if that includes not doing work or doing very little work.

4326,"""No-deal Brexit"" means tariffs, border controls and paperwork.

Like any retailer depending massively on imports, amazon.co.uk can't be pleased with a perspective that would negatively impact their turnover and margins.

This, in turn, would have a negative impact on employement in the retail sector.

Consumers would be impacted too, with imported products becoming more expensive and less available.

Conversely, British exports, half of which is at present absorbed by the UE, would significantly slow down too.

Of course, domestic demand for domestic products would increase, which would benefit certain segments of the industries. It would take some time however for the consumers to adapt and find the substitution satisfying.

In another domain, it is likely that foreign investment in Britain would diminish as well, so while facing an increased demand, domestic companies would have trouble financing their expansion. Interest rates would certainly rise, putting the less moneyed individuals under pressure.

Would all this translate to *civil unrest* ? That is anyone guess.

What do you mean by this? I've never heard that the US is ""bankrolling"" the Paris agreement? Yes, the US lose money on reaching for the goals, but so does every other nation. Of course it would be cheaper to say fuck it and just polute wildly without any concerns.

&gt;Merkel recently said that they can't count on America to protect Europe anymore

Can I see a source on this? This looks really rephrased. Maybe she said that the US can't be counted on as an military ally anymore? Which is may be kind of true. As long as the current POTUS remains in power, any ally of the US cannot count on anything anymore.

Yes, several of the NATO nations aren't spending enough on military, but is has been agreed 4 years ago that all countries are that are underfunding are going to increase their military spending to at least 2% of GDP. 

&gt;At the subsequent 2014 Wales summit, the leaders of NATO's member states formally committed for the first time spend the equivalent of at least 2% of their gross domestic products on defence by 2024, which had previously been only an informal guideline

&gt;Why are we surprised that a Muslim will always stick with the other Muslims? WHY? You can have them be born in the West. You can teach them in Western schools, you can preach how they are totally more French/English/German than the REAL locals. They will always stick together first and foremost, they will always choose their fellow Muslims, even if they are horrible people over you, because they are their people.

&gt;A Muslim will never look to benefit the wider society over his fellow Muslims and the power gain of Islam. Khan would literally abolish all the rights of non-Muslims before he did anything, even just the smallest thing that could marginally inconvenience his brethren.

&gt;Germany is already dead, you guys don't know it. 40% of your 5 and younger are immigrants, and that's excluding the Turks already present in Germany.

&gt;I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime, but potentially before I die, Germany could become an Islamic Theocratic state through Democratically elected officials. In 30 years, I would not be surprised if Germany is 60% non-Christian, non-German, non-European and predominately from the Middle East. If it does look that Germany is going to defect to the Middle East, I doubt that NATO would allow Germany to keep its modern armament and it would probably have most of it confiscated first. So there is at least that. Look at what happened when South Africa fell and it get rid of its nukes ""voluntarily"". I don't see NATO allowing a Caliphate Germany keeping its advanced tanks and jets.

You come pick the lists on the right, with a brown envelope, go vote secretly behind the curtain, then go on the left to briefly give your electoral and identity cards to the people next to the urn for them to check if your name is on their list, which you sign after inserting your vote, and voilà.      

You always receive directly at your adress the official, quite sizable envelop with every list's program/propaganda a few weeks before the vote, anyways. Those come with the exact same piece of paper you use to vote on the first place, so you can very well go to the voting place picking only an envelope or the non ""shamed"" party lists, hiding your actual vote on yourself, and nobody would be the wiser.     
For the elections in which you vote directly for one or two people whose names only appear on the voting paper, you can even print it yourself, given that you use a normal font and cut it the right size.

From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy

&gt;The Gamergate controversy stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the hashtag #GamerGate. The controversy centered on issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture. Gamergate is used as a blanket term for the controversy as well as for the harassment campaign and actions of those participating in it.

&gt;In August 2014, the harassment campaign targeted several women in the video game industry; notably game developers Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu, as well as feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend, wrote a disparaging blog post about her, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included doxing, threats of rape, and death threats.


A great summary of the harrassement campaign known as ""GamerGate"":

https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gamergate

&gt;Gamergate is a distillation of the worst of the worst of the Internet, taking the form of a 2014 4chan raid that went on for far too long, showing everyone how reactionary, virulently misogynistic, and frankly stupid the cellarian underbelly of the video gaming community can be. Nintendo has officially referred to GamerGate as an ""online hate campaign"".

Also, the founder of this hate sub shut it down because it became to hateful even for his standards.

http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/406493-gamergate-mod-shuts-down-kotakuinaction-calls-it-a-cancerous-growth

And I mean when the founder of a hateful movement shuts down the forum because it's getting too hateful for even him, that's saying something. Thankfully the mods restored this valuable conversation, because what would Reddit be without some nice misogyny, right?

Of course it's not coincidence.

Then they went for a walk through and threw their cigarettes away. Then they ate lunch made with their single-use grills, which are aluminium trays filled with charcoal you put directly on the ground. And once they've done that they made a romantic campfire to roast some marshmallows.

4572,"Yeah, I have to agree there. I think the biggest problem right now is that deportation is so tricky/difficult, in that it creates a bit of an ""overflow"" where the established means of dealing with applicants are insufficient, not to mention that it's harder for the state to deport some criminals who'd have ""overstayed their welcome"". Which sadly makes for great ammunition for populists to bash the entire concept, regardless of how much money it actually costs, or how those who cause problems are just a fraction of the entire group, etc.

I really don't like how all of this results in ""honest"" applicants in dire need for assistance suffering from a public backlash caused by those who do not qualify as refugees. As you said, I can understand why they want to get here (another user linked a harrowing story [here](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/african-migrant-returns-home-after-failing-to-get-to-europe-a-1212776.html); really makes me feel for guys like him), but it's just an unfortunate reality that, as much as I dislike picking up a populist slogan, ""Europe can't take all of Africa"". But there is a balance to be found. We should focus on fixing the actual problems rather than just ""closing the borders"".

However, as the coalition column was joining bosphorus, the Duke of Provence learnt that the french and their allies did not give anything they promised to him, and used the coalition to expand french own territory. It was clearly a mean to expand on spanish territory. 
The Duke felt betrayed and thought it was time to take his due.
With the brave Napolitan forces, which he helped to get their independance from Aragon tyranny, the duke took back Avignon and all the lands papal states had conquered over our italian brothers.
However, the major nations couldn't handle with a rebel minor who refused to be either a slave or a vassal. Burgundy, France, Castille, Savoy and Britanny joined to destroy completely the duchy.
Now we can hear the men prepare for the final battle, they will not give up, they will not forget their duty : they will fight to death against french and papal tyranny! No retreat possible, no peace deal will be given by our ennemies. Our old french brothers are coming here to exterminate us, we all know how it will end.

I was sick and tired of dreaming and just decided one day to make a plan and start saving for what was only supposed to be a vacation in Europe. I like facts and I enjoy learning. This lead me to go deeper and deeper into Europe.

First, I studied and interned in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 4 months and traveled in and around the Balkans for the remainder of summer. 

I was a political science student at the time. My final year of uni, I had to take a language. Russian was full, so I, being naive, settled for the Ukrainian language. Decided to work for a year and save for grad school. In the summer of 2013 I decided to do it in Russia - because you know Russia and the U.S. always have beef, so there will be a job for me at the end of the rainbow. During this time, no one really cared about Russia. All was quiet.

In winter of 2014, Russia took Crimea back. September 2015...Russia. Winter 2016 Kiev Ukraine summer 2016 Odessa Ukraine for the summer.

US exports goods worth 10€ to the EU, which have a duty of 10% on it. The EU collects 1€ in tariffs as well.

4696,"&gt; It did work to prevent a world war.

... No, it didn't.

&gt;I mean, if you give Prussian heartlands to Poland, is it that big of a surprise Germany wants to take them back regardless of threats

The Russians consider Kiev their historical heartland too. They also always have had ideas of panslavism and uniting orthodoxy... Does that mean we should ignore the needs and wants of all slavic and/or orthodox countries so Russia can always reclaim it after it collapsed again? No, Russia is just one country and its desires aren't more important that those of other countries.

There were German settlers in Russia too, does that mean Russia should just have given Hitler his Lebensraum?

&gt;The whole thing could have been avoided if the treaty of Versailles has been fairer towards Germany

There's something unfair about every treaty, so what? Lobby to set it straight then by peaceful means if you think you have a good case. I'm not going to excuse Hitler because war is a dirty business. Don't start wars, then: the whole thing could have been avoided if Imperial Germany didn't allow WWI to start. The past isn't perfect, why chain yourself to it?

&gt;Because American influence in the modern globalized world is greater than any other nation in history. Almost every country in EU is part of NATO. Plenty of other countries are allied with US as well. 

""Having influence"" is very different from the concept ""sphere of influence"". ""Sphere of influence"" means that Great Powers unilaterally claim exclusivity in a territory, to the point of being able to veto decisions of states there, while ""having influence"" doesn't exclude others to have influence and doesn't mean that you claim political veto power.

&gt;In which the US has the upper hand... 

Debatable. China and the EU have their own strengths that surpass the USA in those areas, then you still have OPEC and other continental trade areas are being built.

&gt;I don't complain if they try an invasion against Cuba for aligning with the Soviets, but I do complain if they fight for absurd reasons other side of the planet. There is no way you could justify it as being anyway defensive. 

That's why I didn't. It's not because I approve of some actions of the USA that I have to approve of all of their actions.

&gt;The problem is that we did not sanction or punish them, we only refused to participate. Should we also pat ourselves in the back for not participating in the invasion of Crimea?

You don't seem to understand that relations between countries are not a single monodimensial scale between -100 and +100. This is not a video game. Despite our disagreement with the Iraq invasion (which wasn't universal either, some EU states participated), the USA still provides a major peacea and safety benefit to many countries, including us. Them being wrong on the Iraq issue doesn't erase all that. It *did*, however, reduce their standing and increase support for an EU-level military organization to at least make an alternative possible. So if they keep doing that, we'll eventually reduce our association with them.

(In addition, Iraq was a dictatorship that initiated several wars in the Middle East and was actively commiting atrocities, and the US didn't end up with territorial gains and Iraq is now more stable and more democratic. In the balance, there's little lost and a little gained with better future perspectives. As for Russia in Crimea, they annexed part of a democratic state for their own gain, and created a festering conflict that will keep causing instability for the next decade at least, and are still sustaining it. This will do damage for longer than the US occupied Iraq. Even that comparison where the USA was objectively wrong still ends up in their relative advantage.)

&gt;No we can't because we're so deeply connected to the Americans and their world order. I mean, maybe we can, but we won't. 

We have all the authority. The thing is, lots of people here benefit from it, like it, and/or aren't convinced it needs changing. Don't pretend that we're having a consensus that we want a specific alternative but only the USA is keeping us from it.

&gt;Well, we still have strong economic and political ties with them. 

Beneficial ties that exist becaause of many, many personal, individual friendly relationships between Europeans and Americans. You're asking people to break up their personal relations and businesses that benefit them, for what?

&gt;The chaos they achieved in the Middle-East is threatening us. Remember those tens of Islamist terrorist attacks in the last few years? I do. Remember that refugee wave that will most definitely happen again? I do. 

Funny, before that it was *Iraq* that created chaos in the Middle East. Now the USA removed Iraq and now you blame them. It was also the former Baathist cadre of Saddam that managed to organize IS, by the way.

&gt;We shouldn't ignore them, but we also shouldn't intentionally step on their toes by expanding NATO to their borders which makes them do invasions like Georgia or Ukraine in the first place. 

That's easy to reverse: they should stop being a dick to their neighbours so those don't come begging NATO to shelter them. *All NATO expansions happened on request of the new members*.

Again, appeasement doesn't work, historically: you have no support for your hypothesis that Russia would be nice and cuddly to us if only we let them control their neighbouring states. Judging on past performance, they'd be even more of nuisance. So givent that uncertain, impermanent benefit I'm not supporting the certain sacrifice of the sovereignty of half a dozen European countries in that experiment.

4711,"&gt; Look, just because someone, and I mean SOMEONE, is going to kill you over their ethnic identity doesn’t give you the right to do so yourself

Yes! That is correct. Nobody is asserting anything like this. Either you're arguing a massive strawman or there's a big misunderstanding. The fact is that the world isn't a very nice place. Ethnic tensions small and large are a thing. That's why it's better and more peaceful to have different ethnic groups physically segregated and have sovereignty over their own territories. It's for peace and prosperity that we have these different states. Middle East would be a heck of a lot safer if Kurds had their own territory.

&gt; You’d rather label someone as an other and think of it as a zero sum game than what it actually is.

A cooperative game only works if there are repercussions for breaking the rules, i.e. playing the cooperative game is considered a better option than selfishness. That's why every player needs to retain the possibility of playing the zero sum game. It's why we have borders and nations' self-determination within borders. So we have the safety to reach out and actually cooperate on fair and muturally beneficial terms.

4763,"Behind the paywall:

Imagine that the German national team had celebrated its World Cup win four years ago by inviting a Nazi singer to share the stage with the players. A singer who in the past had sung warmly about Auschwitz, the annihilation of Jews and the SS, whose song about beautiful Germany, including parts that were lost in World War II, became the team’s anthem.

In Zagreb last Monday, the Croatian national soccer team celebrated its second-place World Cup finish with a parade through the capital. Some 500,000 greeted them. people lining the streets. 

Marko Perkovic — nicknamed Thompson, after the submachine gun — was invited to join the players on stage. Together they sang the team’s anthem, which mentions Croatian parts of Bosnia. 

Thompson fought in the 1991-95 Croatian War of Independence before becoming a Balkan folk-rock patriotic singer. In the past, he sang much more-pointed songs — including one about the Jasenovac, a Croatian death camp in Slavonia where hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Roma and opponents of the Nazi-Croatian regime were murdered during World War II. “The Neretva River sweeps Serbs to the blue Adriatic,” goes the song, which praises Ante Pavelic, the leader of the Nazi-Croatian Ustase regime.

Thompson begins his performances with the battle cry of the Ustase, and Nazi salutes can be seen in the audience, together with Ustase shirts and other paraphernalia. His performances have been outlawed in some European countries and even in Croatia attempts have been were made to prevent them. In the celebrations in Zagreb the blunter songs were not heard, but shout-outs in praise of the Ustase regime certainly were, and the fact that Thompson became the center of the celebrations sparked major debate in Croatia and in the Croatian diaspora.

A number of Internet sites put up polls like: “Thompson in the square in Zagreb — for or against,” which showed that Croatians are split on the issue. In the Croatian diaspora, especially the German-speaking part of it,  sharply worded articles came out against the singer. “It’s like falling in love with a man and then finding out he has a swastika tattoo,” wrote Danijela Pilic in Suddeutsche Zeitung.

The invitation to Thompson was extended by the players, especially Luka Modric, who misread public sentiment. Perkovic himself denies that he is a Nazi-supporting fascist. “I am a patriot, not a fascist,” he said.

The Weisenthal Center’s Efraim Zuroff is not persuaded. In a statement, Zuroff said that Perkovic was a notorious supporter of the pro-Nazi regime, who sang songs that call for the murder of Serbs, and that inviting him to sing “gives his fascist views a legitimacy they do not deserve.”

The controversy reveals the unresolved attitude of Croatia to its dark past and tensions created after the War of Independence. As expected, the populist regime, headed by the camera- and hug-loving President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, turned the team and the celebrations into a loyalty test. 

After Croatians united in their support for their team in the World Cup in Russia, and many people across the Balkans, including Serbs, openly rooted for it, the Croatians scored a resounding own goal.

“[W]ithin Croatia there’s some bitterness and disappointment, as there is the sense that some symbols have yet again been appropriated by a certain political color, as if others — those who disagree with what Thompson stands for — were ‘not Croatian enough’.” Tena Prelec, a researcher at the European Institute of the London School of Economics, told the Financial Times.

The Thompson affair is significant mainly because Croatia has to harness the success of its soccer team to rehabilitate the sport locally. The 2018 miracle happened despite the politicized Croatian sports federation, despite the Croatian league’s corruption and bias toward Dinamo Zagreb and despite the government, which did not do enough to change the situation. In Croatia there are not enough pitches or coaches and promising players have to sell their future to people like the former strongman of the football association and Dinamo Zagreb, Zdravko Mamic.

**Part of a wider political struggle in Croatia**
Instead, the team has become part of a political struggle that is tearing apart Croatia, which is now the throes of an economic crisis and emigration. In a country were veteran’s organizations dare to put up a memorial plaque in the Jasenovac death camp bearing a fascist slogan, and only a year later did the government move the plaque to a nearby town, inviting a man like Thompson is hugely significant.

Sports and soccer always served Croatian nationalism, after it won its independence. The first president, Franjo Tudjman, enlisted athletes for the young state and tried to turn Dinamo Zagreb into the country’s national team. He changed its name to Croatia Zagreb and the Croatian secret service was brought on board to ensure that the group would win championships. Reports from surveillance of referees, players and coaches, administrators and fans were prepared to blackmail officials on the way to the national team’s championships. 

In favor of Dinamo’s fans, first and foremost the Bad Blue Boys, it must be said that they fought this trend. While there are places where fans are proud to be “the country’s team,” and enjoy the sweeping corruption, Dinamo’s fans did all they could to prevent it. They refused to recognize the name “Croatia Zagreb,” they set fire to Tudjman’s seat in the wretched Maksimir Stadium and finally, after Tudjman died, they got what they wanted, the traditional name Dinamo Zagreb was back.
 
The main square in Zagreb was cleaned up the next morning from the leftovers of the celebration. The shadow of Thompson, on the other hand, will continue to cast a pall over Croatian soccer for years to come.",,/r/europe/comments/91f75w/croatias_national_soccer_team_celebrates_with_a/e2xl6a1/,Chukapu,1532416492

Farmers planting GMO are not allowed to do this and have to buy new seeds for every harvest. So lower cost of seeds vs GMO's higher yield. 

Problem here is that seeds tend to travel naturally from field to field. Birds and other animals eat from one field and crap on the next for example. One field has GMO *planted* next does't. So eventually the field that had natural seeds planted also has some GMO growing in there *and vice versa* 

Next someone from company X who designed the GMO seeds of the next field goes and finds one of their plants growing in the field that was planted with natural seeds.

That company can now sue the farmer who had planted natural seeds for theft of intellectual property. *Edit usually they just settle if the farmer agrees to start buying their seeds in the future, instead of farming his own*

So that's a ""no"" on wire transfers?

Seriously, your whole argument here is that if a British industrial concern bought a bunch of German chemicals in 1914 they **physically transported the money across borders**?

Do you have something to back up this absurd claim?

&gt;Russia cannot start a large scale conflict in Europa without also opening themselves to attack from China.

Why would China attack Russia?

What in the past 30 years(other than a Tom Clancy book, I guess)  has made you think that China's primary goal vis a vi border disputes is to go after Siberia or something?  As opposed to, I don't know, taking advantage of the situation to push around it's neighbors in the Western Pacific where they *routinely* get into pissing matches about uninhabited islands?

&gt;You literally just made an argument that they are aggressive powers. Can't have it both ways.

I can if they are are rational, and we're tracking established history.  Of course, you think that in 1914 the only way financial transactions occurred was transferring Scrooge McDuck levels of physical money, so we've established you aren't big on history.

We have an established history of Russia biting off chunks of it's neighbors in the last 15 years, longer if you count them keeping Transdinistr in Moldova carved out.

We have an established history of China pushing around it's neighbors over disputed islands in the past 15 years.

You know what we have to go back to *Brezhnev* for?  China and Russia having border tensions.  There is every incentive for China, or Russia, to let the other push out and very little incentive to start a war with the other.

The latest on forest fires in Greece (all times local):

2:55 a.m.

A spokesman for the Greek government says the death toll from two big wildfires raging on the outskirts of Athens has risen to at least 20.

Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said early Tuesday that at least 69 other people have been hospitalized with injuries. Many are in serious condition.

Greece has sought international assistance to cope with the fires near the capital, which have destroyed dozens of homes, burned cars and prompted tourists and Greeks to flee to beaches east of Athens for dramatic rescues by boats.


12:50 a.m.

A senior Health Ministry official in Greece has confirmed that two people have been killed in wildfires that are raging near Athens.

Official Niko Papaefstathiou told state television the two victims were taken to an Athens hospital early Tuesday.

Public health officials say at least 25 other people have been hospitalized with injuries, mostly for burns. Three of the cases are considered life-threatening.

Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras cut short a visit to Bosnia on Monday and returned to Athens to preside over an emergency response meeting with fire chiefs and government officials.

Two major forest fires are burning out of control on either side of Greece's capital, burning houses, prompting residents to flee and turning the sky over Athens a hazy orange from the smoke.


11 p.m.

Greece's coast guard says a search-and-rescue operation is underway for 10 people, believed to be foreign tourists, who fled a massive forest fire in a boat and were missing.

A coast guard helicopter and vessel were searching the sea near the town of Rafina, northeast of the Greek capital of Athens. They acted after receiving notification from Danish authorities, who had received a call from someone in Greece saying they were among a group of 10 people who fled a forest fire in a boat.

The coast guard said it was unclear what type of vessel the 10 people were in.

Two major forest fires raged out of control Monday on either side of Athens, burning houses, prompting residents to flee and turning the sky over Athens a hazy orange from the smoke.


9:40 p.m.

Fire officials say at least six people have suffered burns in a forest fire near Athens.

Fire Service spokeswoman Stavroula Malliri said all six have been hospitalized Monday but details of their conditions remained unclear. They were burned in a fire that was raging northeast of Athens in the Penteli area.

Malliri says three hospitals in greater Athens have been placed on alert to receive more casualties if needed.

Regional Greek authorities have declared a state of emergency in the eastern and western parts of greater Athens, as fires fanned by gale-force winds raged through pine forests and seaside towns on either side of the Greek capital. Greece is seeking assistance from the European Union to battle the fires.


9:25 p.m.

Greece is seeking assistance from the European Union to battle forest fires that have destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee on the outskirts of Athens.

Civil Protection Spokesman Spyros Georgiou told The Associated Press that the formal request would be made later Monday.

The decision was made after the greater Athens regional authority declared a state of emergency in the eastern and western parts, as fires fanned by gale-force winds raged through pine forests and seaside towns on either side of the Greek capital.


9:10 p.m.

Regional Greek authorities have declared a state of emergency in the eastern and western parts of greater Athens, as fires fanned by gale-force winds raged through pine forests and seaside towns on either side of the Greek capital.

One fire was burning Monday northeast of Athens in the Penteli area, moving into the town of Rafina. In nearby Mati, the coast guard was sending a patrol boat to evacuate people trapped on a beach by the flames.

The second wildfire was ravaging mountainous pine forests 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Athens. The blaze has created such thick smoke that the main highways between the Peloponnese and the Greek mainland have been shut down and an orange haze has descended on Athens.

Regional governor Rena Dourou called the state of emergency in East and West Attica and was providing buses, water trucks and machinery to help battle the fires.


1:30 p.m.

Two major forest fires are raging out of control on either side of the Greek capital Monday, burning houses, prompting residents to flee and turning the sky over Athens a hazy orange from the smoke. Some people were reported to be trapped on a beach by the flames.

The first fire broke out in a pine forest near the seaside settlement of Kineta 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Athens between the capital and Corinth. At least 150 firefighters were on the scene while five water-dropping planes and seven helicopters helped to fight the blaze from the air.

The second major fire broke out Monday afternoon in the Penteli area northeast of Athens. Local authorities said they were evacuating children's summer camps, while dozens of homes and cars were destroyed. At least three aircraft and a helicopter were battling the flames, along with at least 50 firefighters.

The coast guard was sending at least one patrol boat to rescue people who called to say the fire had trapped them on a beach.",,/r/europe/comments/919nab/greece_seeks_eu_help_to_battle_forest_fires/e2x5fyv/,SkinnyNerd,1532396517

5120,"That's from a similar incident in 2014, but I agree it is relevant. This is the best article I can find on the debate: https://www.samelandspartiet.se/2014/12/22/svenskar-ar-samer-del-3/

It is an old article by now, yet highly relevant IMO as it offers the views of several Samiska politicians in a debate that is eerily similar to the one today. (Sorry for the Swenglish.)

&gt; Björn Söder har av det politiska etablisemanget, det svenska såväl som det samiska, allmänt kritiserats för att ta sig rätten att definiera vem som är svensk, framhåller Åhrén.  Söders kritiker har i stor utsträckning kontrat med att samer visst är svenskar, till synes utan att reflektera över att de därmed gör sig skyldiga till samma brott de attackerar Söder för, det vill säga att ta sig friheten att bestämma vem som är svensk, hävdar Åhrén.

...

&gt;Håkan Jonsson, Sametingets styrelseordförande   får också tillfälle att kommentera Åhrén synpunkter  och han menar  att Mattias Åhréns uttalande är både okunnigt och trångsynt. Samtidigt, tämligen motsägelsefull tillägger han i DN intervju att: ” Vi samer är enligt grundlagen ett folk, men bor man som same i Sverige och har svenskt medborgarskap så är man svensk.” 

...

&gt; Det offentliga samtalet som uppstått efter Björn Söders uttalande i Dagens Nyheter, där även samiska företrädare  som Sametingets styrelseordförande Håkan Jonsson  deltagit visar tydligt att den koloniala tankevärlden fortfarande dikterar resonemangen genom  problematiserandet av samernas  eventuella svenskhet i anda av paternalism. Problemet är nog att många som kritiserar Söders uttalande,  själva är  ängsliga  att se ”Björn Söder”i spegel när man rakar sig eller lägger sin make-up på morgonen.

What it shows is how the rest of us in Sweden even now struggle with how to treat Samer. Hell, I'm literally at the southern end of Sweden so I really ought not to decide whether or not Samer are Swedish or not. That is up to each and every one of them to decide. 

What Björn Söder, and sadly his opponents as well (me included), is deny the Samer the freedom to choose by labelling them as either Swedes or not.

Here's a good radio interview from the 2014 incident: https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2327&amp;artikel=6046378

And here's an article about the 2018 one: https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/politiker-i-natbrak-om-minoriteters-svenskhet

&gt; Sametingets talman Paulus Kuoljok säger att inlägget är provocerande och ser det som valpropaganda.

&gt;\– SD vinner röster på sånt här agerande, särskilt i sametäta områden. De har visat sin fientliga hållning under ganska lång tid, så jag blir inte speciellt förvånad

And here's a series of articles that weren't super relevant, but that I found interesting: 
https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/qs/last-night/last-night-in-stentrasket/

As I previously mentioned Söder also talked about both Samer and Jews (in  this incident. In 2014 he talked  about other groups as well). Regarding Jews [Willy Silberstein](https://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Silberstein?wprov=sfla1) is one of them who was worried by Söder's comments. He wrote a column about it and partook in a debate with Söder.

Column: https://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/a/21edj4/jo-bjorn-soder--jag-ar-bade-jude-och-svensk

Debate: https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1650&amp;artikel=6978721

Excerpts from the column.
&gt; DEBATT. I Sverige i dag finns judar, och säkert företrädare för andra grupper, som är rädda. De är rädda för våld, hat, övergrepp, fördomar. Judar bär ofta hellre keps än den judiska huvudbonaden kipa för att de är rädda.

&gt; I denna stämning kliver Sveriges vice talman Björn Söder in och spär på motsättningar och avskiljer judar och samer från övriga Sverige.

&gt; Varför? Det är inte första gången Björn Söder säger att jag och andra judar inte är svenskar.

&gt; Senast twittrade han, fredagen den 15 juni: ”De (judar och samer) har minoritetsställning just för att de inte är svenskar”.

&gt; Varför är denna fråga så viktig för talman Björn Söder? Varför behöver han dela in medborgare i svenskar och icke-svenskar? Tror han att han minskar judars och samers utsatthet eller är han medveten om att han förmodligen gör det motsatta, nämligen spär på fördomar och spänningar?

...

&gt; Jag har noterat att Mattias Åhrén, som är folkrättsjurist och same, ger Björn Söder rätt, bland annat med hänvisning till Sametinget.

&gt; Låt mig då betona att Mattias Åhrén inte talar för mig, svensk och jude. Jag har inget Sameting eller något motsvarande. Och jag citerar gärna en annan statsvetare, Mark Klamberg. På Facebook skriver han:

&gt;""En minoritet är också är en del av folket. Det är i vart fall så folkrätten förhåller sig till dessa begrepp och det är också grunden för nationalstaten som fenomen. Sverigedemokraterna tycks fortsatt ha en djupt oroväckande syn på minoriteter och jag finner det helt otroligt att denna man är vice talman för Sveriges riksdag.”

&gt;**För övrigt spelar det ingen roll vad Mattias Åhrén säger. Björn Söder ska inte definiera om jag är svensk eller inte.**

-Willy Silberstein.

Here's a quick translation of the last bit: **Moreover, it doesn't matter what Mattias Åhrén says. Björn Söder shouldn't decide whether or not I am Swedish**. -Willy Silberstein

TL;DR Björn Söder shouldn't, as Willy Silberstein says, decide who is and isn't Swedish. None of us who aren't should. 

Edit: I should have clarified that the last bit was from Willy. I felt it was especially important since what Åhrén has said before has certainly come up several times in past debates, and is controversial. He has a point, but it doesn't apply to everyone as can be seen with Silberstein's column. And more importantly, Åhrén similarly does not speak  for everyone  affected by Söder's comments. It is a complicated debate, and I apologise for not having time to translate everything. ",Scania,/r/europe/comments/917bcl/sweden_democrats_the_clear_favorite_to_be_the/e2ww3bk/,Soderskog,1532387277

First of, I don't quite think you can say you are unbiased in this arguement, lol.
Secondly I don't quite know if you can called be biased because I've said I've listen to a member of the European parliament. This is specifically ironic as the person was actually a part of the movement against the EU.

&gt;Tell me this,what kind of sovereign country would let any freaking parliament apart their own,decide what will happen in their country?How does this sound normal to you?

I afraid I don't quite know what ""normal"" means in this context. I just don't think I see the world as black and white as you. Do I think countries cooperating is a good thing? Yes, very much so. If that makes ""less normal"", then I'm fine with that. History made borders but they have rarely held for more than a couple centuries at the very most.

&gt;Wow so much bias,listen,UK have 1 resonation problem right now and that EU immigration policy fault.They are losing their country to foreign factor.True,there will be some financial loses there,but that price is nothing compared to having full control over your country.

I just cannot argue with you when you see the world so radically different than me. If you think Theresa may is having a swell time right now, then I don't know what to tell you.

&gt;How the hell did EU behind closed door for 2 straight days made Tsipras overrule freaking refferendum of his own people?

I'm not saying it was a graceful situation, but you still havin answered how the Greek mess was the EU's fault? The insane budgets were all made by Greece themselves and the EU send them a lot of help in return. Frankly I just don't think that decision was something that was up to the Greek people alone when it affected so many others.

But you know what, the EU isn't perfect and everyone can luckily learn and a lot of precautions have been made to make sure it doesn't happen again.

&gt;That ""massive funding"" is getting back to creditors tenfold when you see how much countries lose with highly trained jsut leaving.

5160,"I like the crashing car comparison, and I do see your point. Although I think it's a bit exaggerated, since Bannon has, IMO, jack stuff in term of political influence. Except for the headlines that the media provides, OFC. And you're right when you say that Europe needs a smooth transition. Radical changes usually don't last.

My problem is that, ATM, it's kind of hard to be a classical liberal/libertarian in Europe, since it's easy to be associated with the far-right. So, if you, say, asked for proper freedom of speech, people will attack you for supporting freedom of speech right even for Nazis. If you wanted to be able to choose your own health insurance provider, people will call you asocial and not supportive of the community. Want border controls and enforcement of current law? Tough luck, racist. Either way, since these positions are (at least in politics) more or less minority positions, you will get attacked, one way or another. And it's very hard to face them. This is why the right in the US loves Donald Trump. You just can't get to him, no matter how much sh*t you fling.

Yeah, there may rise a figure that will have the intelligence and the strength of character to fight and win fairly, someone more or less like Ben Shapiro. But mostly, people like Milo or Bannon or Trump, not very bright, but shameless and with some charisma. Although, to be honest, I personally wouldn't want to associate with Bannon either. But then again, I wouldn't mind it if some other people did. It's a moral dilemma, which TBH I'm not very good at solving.

If you do not have a *sufficient* demos you cannot have a functional democracy, the elections don't have legitimacy and people won't respect it. I say ""sufficient"" because there's no such thing as a tightly definable collective unit of people, everyone is an individual, but big sets of individuals can overlap greatly in beliefs and attitudes to the extent that they voluntarily go by a shared label, ""British"", ""Dutch"", ""Austrian"" - at that point you can have a functional democracy because people have mutual ambitions and aims.

Without that, ""democracy"" (really pseudo-democracy, there is no demos) then becomes little more than a weapon for competing demoi (plural) and you end up with the kind of problems that occur in the Middle East in particular, where fighting tribal identities are just expected to become this vague artificial thing we call Afghan, Iraqi or Lebanese. In reality ruling governments just seek to empower their tribe, per Saddam Hussein.

I'm of a belief that much of Western Europe is skating by on the momentum of history and institutions, little more.

5316,"Well then you might want to re-read my comment then and try to understand the point that I was making. The point is that in the EU, the UK has representation and laws are made fairly. Outside of the EU, the UK will not have comparable influence on the world stage and will end up having to follow regulations from the US or the EU anyway, however these will *actually* be ""foreign regulations"" that the UK ""didn't get a say in"". 

The US doesn't have this problem as it A) was never a member of the European Union, B) isn't right next to the European Union and C) is much much larger than the UK in terms of Economy and Influence.

&gt; Brussels has power over each member state. This is how they can enact Europe-wide legislation on worker's rights, etc.

Yes, and the UK is part of Brussels, the UK has a commissioner and MEPs. This is how democracy works, people come together and agree on things.

&gt; A country outside the EU is not forced to follow the EU standards when trading with an EU country. You have been able to import goods from China since the 1980s long before there were bi-lateral trade deals. Now, if two entities decide to create a trade deal, let's say UK-EU, then manufacturers in both places will have to abide by that in order to export goods.

I'm aware of this, however China, again, has much more influence than the UK. Also, when making an agreement, obviously, both sides are going to want to be able to export things. So when the US wants to export, for example, battery farmed/chlorinated meat, the UK may not be able to afford to say no after leaving the EU so will have to lower its standards.

&gt; More freedom to negotiate individually usually means a better deal for everyone. It's not that complicated.

Introducing a massive power asymmetry doesn't give you more freedom to negotiate.

5420,"&gt;&gt;they cost money, get rid of them they are usless anyways"".
&gt;
&gt;They do cost us money, but theyre a integral part of our kingdom. If you truly heard that theyre worthless, you hanged out with trash. Maybe try meeting more educated / aware people in the future. The fact that they dont ''receive'' direct funding doesnt mean they dont cost money. We are resonsible to assist all islands militarily and we represent them abroad. This costs money. More than they contribute. Aruba is also a exception but other islands like St. Maarten cost much more than they bring in.

I'm not sure why you are reacting so defensively, but let me try to respond in any case. 

I, like a lot of Arubans went to university in NL. So what I meant by ""gatherings"" is mostly related in some way or form to the university. Hardly idiots. In this case Haagse hogeschool and then Leiden. In those seven years due to family and friends I lived in many different areas outside of the randstad as well. 

Now to be on the same page you have to understand that I'm talking specifically about Aruba. When it comes to the coast guard, Aruba pays its fair share to the budget. Off course, just like in other alliances, the one who is a much bigger country pays more in relation. This is logical. 

As far as helping other countries in the kingdom, the Netherlands is not the only one obliged to do so. As per our statutes, every country must help to the best of their ability in times of calamity. We saw this on St Maarten last year with hurricane Irma, where all other countries in the kingdom helped out. The Dutch sent navy ships and personnel stationed in Aruba and Curaçao, together with the Aruban amd Curaçao militia to St Maarten. All the critical patients who needed dialysis and other life saving treatments were immediately brought over and welcomed in Aruba and Curaçao. There are many more stories but just to show that everyone helps to the best of their abilities, which is all you can ask.

&gt;
&gt;I do remember that in the early 00s every damn Dutchman, including me, was willing to burn down Caracas if we had to in defense of our islands, when Chavez literally wanted to invade the islands.

Off course, and no one doubts it. 


&gt;
&gt;Plus im pretty sure most of the people you talked to were joking anyway. If you know anything about Dutch people you d know that a Hollander considers everything outside of the Holland provinces trash, a Frisian only cares about Friesland and Brabanders hate everything thats not south of the Rhine.
&gt;
&gt;You prop failed to read into that well enough. Dutch people always joke about selling Limburg to Belgium, Twente to Germany and make a big parking lot out of Friesland. The fact that you met a lot of people who claimed to ''just get rid of the islands'' actually only shows theyre a integral part of our kingdom. The fact that all the islands keep voting to stay within the kingdom or even within the Dutch nation shows that this wont change for a very long time.


Yes, my grandfather is Dutch and I know the Dutch culture quite well. 


&gt;
&gt;And even if they do ever become independent, the last thing they want is to become part of Venezuala.

Why would Aruba ever want ti be part of Venezuela? Not even when Venezuela was the richest country in Latin America was that ever an option. The only time Venezuela was used by Aruban politicians was to put pressure on the Netherlands for the Aruban independence cause that led to the status aparte in 1986.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;Also you seem to think that ''Antiliaan'' is a cureword. It isnt. Calling someone a Antiliaan isnt negative. Its just what they are: Dutch antilians. Like how we have Frisians, Hollanders etc, we also have Antilians, and in a international context we say Dutch antilians since there are obviously also non-Dutch antilians.


The word itself off course is not a curse word. But most of the time it is used in Dutch media, it has a negative connotation to it. That's without even going into that ""Antilliaan"" 99% of the time refers to people from Curaçao. 
&gt;
&gt;And also: the important refinery i talked about is indeed in Curacao, not Aruba, like you attempted to correct me.


I never corrected you. I literally just added to what you said. They were both extremely important.

5468,"Sure, but that isn't a moral reproach, as legal residency is a widely held practice and not considered as a violation of someone's rights. It's a compromise, where legal residents certainly do not enjoy all the rights of a citizen, but they also aren't subjected to many obligations of a citizen either. For example, in Estonia non-citizens are not conscripted into military service and are thus not obligated to take part in mandatory national defence. 

&gt;""Integrating"" the minority.

Not quite. The Soviets were assimilating a conquered people whereas the Baltics are now expected to integrate their former conquerers and occupiers, who came there to displace the natives and to benefit from the annexation. In a way, it's almost like asking a rape victim to marry her rapist. 

&gt;They are able to educate in their language, to use it officially etc.

Because that would mean the end of the Baltics as we know it today. Within a generation, they would become Little-Russias, populated and dominated by russian culture and language. This is an impossible demand, as such a demand is akin to asking estonians, latvians and lithuanians to die as unique cultural and linguistic groups. 

The reality is that a language spoken only by about a million people will never be able to compete on equal grounds with a mass-language, spoken by over a hundred million people. Such a change would undermine the very *raison d'etre* of the Baltic nations. They might as well have remained as the western-most provinces of the Russian Federation if they're expected to give equal standing to russian language and russian ethnicity.

5538,"There are basically two ways that Russia could approach an invasion of Europe. The first is an all out war against all NATO (Or at least EU, if they think the US will sit it out) countries at once. Such a war would certainly and immediately go nuclear. Europe doesn't have a lot of nukes, but is has enough to cripple Russia. Such a war would have no winners.

So Russia's much more likely to go for salami tactics. Invade a single country, try to maybe confuse the issue in the early days with flalse flag stuff or good-sounding pretext, and hope you can convince the rest of NATO not to join in.

The problem with that approach however is that if you do this, you can't bomb the rapidly mobilizing German and French armies. You can't cripple their industrial capacity to stop them from building more guns and bombs and stuff. So even if NATO falls apart and doesn't come to the defense of the first country you invaded, you are now a bunch richer, more advanced and more populous nations that are rapidly gearing up for war.

Ultimately either scenario is not very attractive for Russia. Which is why they want to break up NATO first. ",,/r/europe/comments/916gb4/most_germans_think_europe_can_defend_itself/e2vz8sf/,Ozryela,1532358399

We don't need the next generation to know the language on paper. We need them to know it practically and according to the myriad of rules that make up the cultural heritage of our language. We need them to properly know it and be able to use it so that they can become actively involved in the wider Latvian community.  Latvian is not English where you can conjure up a broken way of speaking it and natives will be relatively okay with it. It does not work that way here.

Then Free (the alternative operator by X. Niel) happened, giving full unlimited ADSL for 30e/month with phone and TV included, then with ADSL2+ and Fiber they left the same price and you get whatever the best they can deliver. Since then France is one of the best, especially among the ""older rich economies of western europe"".

They beat down every one into submission to provide great access at low price. And then they did it again with mobile phones (both voice and data), moving France from the bottom to the top. Goes to show how actual competition (rather than incumbents sharing the market) can benefit consumers.

5689,"&gt;So they're just sore losers?

They're also that, and as the rise of the 3rd Reich showed us, it might not be the wisest decision to intentionally suffocate sore losers. 

&gt;Yes, and how does that impact my judgment of the situation? I consistently think that zone of influence bullshit is 19th century nonsense that is completely outdated.

It's more relevant now than it has ever been... Well, maybe if we exclude the Cold war. 

&gt;Geopolitical interest isn't reasonable to begin with. If you want reasonable, then there's a simple standard: initiating violence means that you're wrong. Therefore anyone can ally with whomever the fuck they want for defense.

Nor US or Russia would be nowhere near this position if they had never initiated violence. Of course initiating violence is wrong, but you can't expect countries this big to unconditionally follow that principle no matter how disadvantaged position it leads them to. The only way to avoid these conflicts is to NOT step on other's toes, which is exactly what US has done against Russia by expanding NATO to their borders. If Russia has to choose between annexing already pro-Russian Crimea and secure their geopolitical interests, or see it fall to the hands of NATO for good, why would they choose the latter option? Out of sheer solidarity? 

&gt;Anyone is allowed to challenge it at any time. It's just pointless.

No it isn't. US has no heavenly mandate to be the ultimate leader of the planet, yet they still want to maintain that situation no matter what. 

&gt;What are you complaining about? The period 1945-2018 has been extraordinarily peaceful and prosperous. 

One could argue close ties to US were necessary from 1945 to 1991, but afterwards it has only been about serving the American interests over our own. Is it our interest that half of the Middle-East hates us just like they hate the US? Is it our interest that Russia is an enemy? 

&gt;What do you hope to gain by entering a dickswinging contest with the USA, breaking up the dominant position of NATO and then wasting most of it in a pointless conflict with a former ally?

First and foremost the fact that US would lose their hegemony and Europe would stand for itself first time in eight decades... Secondly the fact that their degenerated consumer capitalism could finally lose a foothold in the world and we could actually figure out something more sustainable than just maintain the old for the sake of it. Thirdly, the fact that US is slowly descending into madness and we are making a fool of ourselves by supporting such country. 

&gt;Hell, you're afraid of displeasing even Russia, why would you even dream of standing up to the USA?

Because US couldn't invade Europe just like that, unlike Russia. Russia doesn't have the whole Atlantic to cross, they only have the European plain to stroll through with their massive land forces. If we must have a common enemy, it should be a country other side of the planet and not a fellow European country.

I cannot find the study or the article linked to the study of the 2006 report on terrorism, but it won’t take much to look it up. 

I should really start building up an archive, because regardless that people
don’t use actual evidence for their claims, while it is demanded towards me as it doesn’t always fit the mainstream narrative, i usually link but don’t always save every report I find. 

I also want to emphasize, that i make cultural claims not ethnic. I also don’t believe zero migration is the way to go, I have many friends who come from syria and afghanistan who integrate very well into our society and work immensely hard to integrate and generally at their job. 

I’m trying to point out that everything has its pros and cons and not every situation can be explained by a one dimensional and oversimplified explanation, which the main stream media and many here do. 

Both sides of the isle push a certain demagougery that needs to be called
out. 

In Hungary we also had many refugees to the US and other places, the places which were open to help and protect people and took their first possible chance to go where this is given, along with our back then huge jewish community. 
I don’t really see your point here. 

Considering multi multiculturalism, i’m not really sure what you think a nation consist of if not an overarching belief in certain foundational values and how that won’t dissolute if there a huge discrepancy of such values.

5761,"&gt;What the fuck? Am i talking to a wall? I'm not defending Russia here. Stop to hear what you want to hear. 

You definitely are defending Russia, or at least blaming NATO for the situation: [""Or Nato should stop to try to expand to these countries, so Putin would stop to threaten them? We had literally the exact same situation 10-15 years ago with both countries. The invasions were a direct answer to Nato. And now you blame this on russia alone?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/907urs/putin_warns_nato_against_closer_ties_with_ukraine/e2pmgtk/)

&gt;I say NATO is a bunch of cowards that will not help Ukraine again. Thousands will die again. NATO lures them into accession talks but won't protect them. Russia will not back down. Accept it and make a choice: fight for Ukraine or fuck off. But don't lure them and then let them die. 

There's nothing to be gained from escalating further. Ukraine will regain control over Donbas eventually. Crimea is destined to become a long-term territorial dispute. Military intervention would perhaps quicken the resolution of the first, but risk increasing tensions and military activity, so that's not wise.

(This part was very long sorry)

Sorry but that mosque is a joke(I am not saying what this liberal mosque says is wrong by the way.Its message is good but it doesn't change anything and it isn't important).Qur'an is very strict and clear in some areas.

You can't make your own church and say all the good stuff and claim that you are the most relaxed version of Christianity and you are important with your 3 supporters.

Considering general Muslim beliefs Turkish one is one of the least strict ones(probably the least strict one is Azerbaijani one or one of the native European muslim communities like Albanians but diffrence isn't that much) and it is easy to observe.In those we don't include mosques or sects like this liberal one because it is bs.There are millions who follow those beliefs like Turkish one and they are naturally devoloped and have solid foundations and will contiue to exist.The Turkish version of Islam also has many stuff that aren't in Qur'an but they are already accepted by the society and are seen as normal while the belief is also getting less strict.

So it is about followers and foundations.These kind of attempts of reform by certian insividuals in the West is just funny and don't work(I don't know about other majority Muslim countries but Turks living in Turkey are less conservative than Turks living in Europe.Turks living in Turkey are also getting more secular despite Erdoğan) and are actually counter productive because it gives some people propaganda material.

Islam isn't Christianity.You can't just reform Islam(espically if you don't live in Muslim majority countries).It is (will contiue to) happening slowly and naturally(with the help of state and organisations in many countries).

The Diyanet saying ""close that mosque"" is just rude and problematic.Everyone has right to express their opionion even if you don't agree with them and you can't shut them down(espically considering the fact that they are in a different  country).Diyanet also tries to connect this to FETO but i don't see any connection.Again this is Diyanet acting political but not related to my comment.

&gt;Then there is [this about Clerics that spy for Turkey](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/27/erdogans-international-network-of-muslim-cleric-spies-turkey-germany-gulen-coup/), 

Which is a problem but not related to Turkish version of Islam.

&gt;There there is [this article, about an book of an german who attented some sermons and translated them into german](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/german-book-warns-of-sermons-inside-mosques-1.3036634). The sum up is they are anti-Integration and too political. A nice statement from the Article ""One imam he heard warned that yielding to the temptations of the secular German “forest” would see them “eaten by the wild animals”"".

Which is a problem but still not proving your strict version of Islam comment.

Turkish mosques are usually used by Erdoğan as a political tool but they are far more relaxed than Arabian backed ones(which is the reason why Turks in Europe never/rarely do any terror attacks and number of radicals are far less)

&gt;And there is a lot more, for example sermons that preach for the turkish war efforts.

I think you are talking about support for operations in Syria?

It is problematic if they did it without approval of German state but again not related to your strict version or Islam comment.

I specifically answered your claim of ""strict version of Islam"" while you are bringing up problems about these mosques and them being used as political tools which isn't related to my comment.",Meskhetian Turk,/r/europe/comments/90zsrn/turkish_workers_arriving_in_germany_1950s/e2vjt5p/,komenistayibey,1532336633

True, while slavery was widespread around the world prior to European chattel slavery, chattel slavery was the worst form of the practice. Not just because of the act of slavery, but also how they sources the slaves. The counties they bought the slaves from (e.g. Mali) had historical slave practice, but in a different form to chattel. A lot of their slaves were prisoners of war. As a result, when Europeans came to buy slaves, slave wars became the main source draining the manpower in both the main country and everyone around it.

5868,"&gt;Britain was then supposed to evacuate the island according to the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, but failed to keep this obligation

A little context for this is useful.  The Treaty of Amiens was a peace treaty between Britain and France that caused a one year lull in the Napoleonic wars.  Some of the terms of the treaty were not fulfilled because within months of the treaty being signed Napoleon took advantage of the peace to engage in new aggressions in Europe, such as the  invasion of Switzerland.  Rather than hand Malta back, Britain retained it as a naval base for the resumption of the war that was clearly coming and which broke out again in 1803.

It is also worth noting that Malta was no conquered by Britain from the Maltese.  France had invaded Malta three years earlier, overthrown the government, consisting of the Knights Hospitallars at the time, and set up an extremely unpopular new government on the French model.  A Maltese rebellion, assisted by Britain, defeated the French garrison, at which point Malta's popular leaders (note, not the former religious government of the Knights), invited Britain in to make the island a British protectorate.  A Declaration of Rights by the Maltese people placed the island into Britain's hands voluntarily and included the line:

&gt;his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power...if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control

Clearly, the islanders had no desire to be ruled over again by an autocratic religious movement.  The Treaty of Amiens, which would have restored Malta to the Knights, was inconsistent with the desires of the people of the island.  Britain continued to rule Malta with the consent of its people until 1964, when it voted to \*not\* become independent but was told it was going to have to go its own way anyway.",,/r/europe/comments/914qnp/today_205_years_ago_malta_officially_became_crown/e2vkbia/,Cryptoalt7,1532337759

5872,"&gt;Then you certainly want a military alliance instead of just standing alone against them.

Well, my people are the only ones who can guarantee the survival of this nation. It's not any other country's job, let alone a country other side of the planet. 

&gt;It's a lot better than on the other side of the Iron Curtain, don't you think?

Yes, but still a shitty totalitarian system destroying our environment, our people and our culture. 

&gt;Besides the point. It's an argument to show that the US definitely is the lesser evil in that comparison, not in favor of ""doing whatever they fuck they want"".

I don't remember the last time Russia invaded a sovereign country, ousted their legal government, occupied them for 8 years and caused the death of 500 000 people. By no metric is US the lesser evil here. 

&gt;After all, Saddam was an illegitimate dictator who rule with force, torture chambers and gassed his own population, and warred with his neighbours. 

Saddam was the strongman of Iraq, keeping it under control. Normal dictator, nothing else. That doesn't justify an offensive invasion by a foreign power even if the American ""good vs. evil"" narrative can make it look like it. 

&gt;Russia doesn't hesitate to invade countries that are somewhat democratic and minding their own business.

Neither does the US. 

&gt;If the US did it Russian-style, the war would still be dragging on. 

And US would only occupy a small portion of Iraq, leaving its leadership and sovereignty otherwise alone. 

&gt;At least the USA has plausible deniability that they actually are deposing dictators and bringing democracy, even if that motivation is obviously secondary. 

That doesn't make an illegal war justified. Otherwise they would have a mandate to invade most countries in the world. 

&gt;Russia goes for the outright land grab, pure self-interest and spite and doesn't do anything constructive. 

Russia protects its geopolitical interests near its borders. Under pro-Russia leadership in Ukraine, Crimea was secured. After a pro-West and anti-Russia coup, it wasn't. US on the other hand wants to maintain its global hegemony by waging war other side of the world. 

&gt;It's as if the USA would occupy and annex a part of Iraq (or Mexico), and kept sending soldiers to keep a war against the rest of it going in the other part.

And you don't think that would happen if eg. Los Zetas would make an anti-US and pro-druggie coup in Mexico? 

&gt;No, that's not how it works. For example, Imperial Germany didn't become content after annexing part of France, Napoleonic France wasn't content with controlling most of Europe, and the British Empire didn't stop after colonizing North America. Why do you think that greed can be sated? 

Of course it can't, which is quite evident when we look at American politics in the last 30 years. So yes, Russia could also become greedy, but it seems pretty unlikely considering the economic and diplomatic costs of already annexing Crimea. After all, that was the result of a pro-West coup happening in Ukraine, not just pure expansionism. 

&gt;As long as Russia thinks it has the right to impose its self-defined geopolitical interests on everyone else, they will keep being a problem and only a big guard dog is going to keep them out.

So where is our guard dog against the US as well? Why does Russia need its enemies' sphere of influence to their borders to keep it in check, but US is granted more and more alliances to support their global cultural, economic and military dominance? 

You know, as long as we treat both Russia and US equally, I have no problem with punishing Russia. But if we're just fine with US destabilizing the whole Middle-East also greatly impacting Europe, we should be fine with Russia attacking Crimea too. 

&gt;And even if you ignore that, why does it only work one way? Why doesn't Russia have to ensure the geopolitical interests of its neighbours are secured, and why doesn't Russia have to work to improve relations?

Every country should do that, but you can't really expect that from countries the size of Russia if they have their enemies' alliances expanding towards their borders and hostile coups in their neighboring countries.

5952,"&gt; **Police work does not stop at the border: new treaty between police services Benelux**

&gt; There is a new police convention between Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The Ministers of the Interior and Justice will sign the treaty soon. Under the slogan: police work does not stop at the border, the police will have more opportunities to act across borders. Minister of the Interior Jan Jambon (N-VA) calls it ""a powerful signal to the criminals"".

&gt; In 2004, it was pioneering work: the treaty that closed the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg police forces in order to work together better across borders. 14 years later, the treaty has been completely revised and expanded. Five ministers from the three countries have reached an agreement on this.

&gt; For example, in the three countries it will now be possible to gain direct access to each other's police databases. That will be done on a hit / no hit basis. During actions organized by the police, it will also be possible to consult the police databases immediately. The population register will also be able to consult the agents, provided that the laws of the various countries are respected. Also the ANPR cameras - which are now on the rise - are not forgotten. This information will eventually also be exchangeable within the three countries. There will also be closer cooperation between the police and local authorities in order to exchange data better.

&gt; **Police chase across the borders**

&gt; A second major part of the treaty deals with police pursuits across borders. That will be a lot easier with the new treaty. A chase that is used in one country can be continued in the other country. Until now it was so that the police already had to know why they were chasing someone and it had to be a serious offense. Now the police will be allowed to pursue until the neighbor can take over the chase. Policemen will even be able to do certain investigative actions, but under strict conditions.

&gt; Not only in the car, but also on the train, the power is extended. This is important for international trains, for example. If a crisis situation occurs, the special units can also act cross-border. And that can also be preventative, in support of, for example, a NATO summit.

&gt; **Minister Jambon: ""Very powerful signal to criminals""**

&gt; Minister of the Interior Jan Jambon (N-VA) is satisfied with the agreement. ""It has taken a lot of negotiation, but we have managed to update and expand the Benelux Police Convention after 14 years.""

&gt; ""It is a very clear signal to the criminals: do not think that you can escape the police or court by crossing the border to the Netherlands or Luxembourg.""

&gt; The treaty will soon be signed by the ministers. Then it will be presented to the various parliaments that still have to give their green light.

What does that have to do with this new law approved by Orbans government?
You're throwing around stuff that has literally nothing to do with this.


&gt;Among the activities covered are “participating in a media campaign”, “building and operating a network”, “educational activities” and “positive propaganda”. Organisations that could be covered say it is unclear what kind of funds the law refers to — salaries, operational costs or other expenses. 

I think what is criticised is, that this legislation is way too vague and basically everything that doesn't fit Orbans ideology can be construed as violating this new law.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/90yp3m/hungary_toughens_migrants_stance_with_propaganda/e2vgwek/,crs205,1532330619

In the final 6 years of the session we managed to triple in size with the help of our friends in Pasai. Hopefully next session we will have no more problems holding down the seat of governance and we'll be able to conquer the rest of the Philippines and repay our favours to our friends in Pasai.
