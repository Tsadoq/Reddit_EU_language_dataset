It has been proven that real fraud represent less than 10% of job seekers, and also 15%  of employers who're frauding some subsidies and taxes through the formation system.  

The total in France is fluctuating from 60 to 100 million per year.   

In the meanwhile: the real Tax Avoidance flying to tax havens, from people or corporations, represent 60 to 150 BILLION € per year, in France.  
The Finance Minister specialized brigade set up after Panama Papers and all other recent leaks brought back in France more than 40 Billion in the last 5 years. They were officially ""efficient beyond all expectations"".

16,"""left"" vs ""right"" as supposed political divisors is like the ultimate testament to that people ultimately base their opinions not on what things are but on people who had opinions before them either in an attractive or aversive fashion. As in ""I like you so I will like everything you like"" or ""I dislike you so I will dislike everything you like"".

What is ""left"" vs ""right"" is completely arbitrarily divided and filled with bizarre paradoxes such as that the ""right"" dislikes Islam while you would ordinarily expect their ideals to align with that of Islam and conversely the left is more apologetic towards it or how the ""left"" often dislikes nuclear energy which is a clean energy source but hey other ""left"" people before it said they didn't like it.

What is ""left"" and what is ""right"" is completely arbitrarily grouped together with no sense of consistency.

I'm pretty sure some parallel universe exists where the US democratic party was in power when 9/11 hit and they were the ones required to act hard when it happened and in that world Muslims and ""the right"" remained big friends rather than becoming enemies; in that very universe Chernobyl never exploded and all the left wing hippies are championing Uranium fission as clean energy.

22,"You're right. It's impossible to completely seal off the borders. It's an illusion to think that's possible. This goes for any border. Maybe in the far future it will be possible, but for now it's not an option.

So I don't have an answer to that. I personally never said they should completely seal it off. It's part of the outcome of the poll. Fortifying the coast D-day-style is something I wouldn't be in favor of either. Even though I'd like the EU to protect the borders better, I'm not the 'building yuuuuge walls'-kinda guy.

I am, however, in favor of the EU getting a way tighter grip on controlling the outer borders. In all fairness, the EU [has](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/e-u-to-reinforce-external-borders-396396) taken [action](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/migratory-pressures/strengthening-external-borders/) the last couple of years, but there's still room for improvement. A lot of room.

But I'm also thinking a little bit bigger than just the outer borders. It the EU really wants to be more effective in controlling the external borders, it's inevitable there will be more defense cooperation and integration as well.

According to the USAFHD, there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers supporting the German war effort in Dresden at the time of the raid.[7] These factories manufactured fuses and bombsights (at Zeiss Ikon A.G.),[135] aircraft components, anti-aircraft guns, field guns, and small arms, poison gas, gears and differentials, electrical and X-ray apparatus, electric gauges, gas masks, Junkers aircraft engines, and Messerschmitt fighter cockpit parts.[7]",,/r/europe/comments/7mtydb/dresden_germany_in_the_wintertime/dry0rcl/,tube_slider,1514616008

As for development help, there's many reasons. From the 80s on Africa has really suffered from HIV/AIDS which put them back many decades in development. Many destabilizing wars and natural disasters have happened that also destroyed all progress in certain countries. Meanwhile the people get too many kids for the demographic pressure from youngsters to lessen, though that's getting less too. The politicians aren't that good either and corruption is rampant, though I would say that's partly due to the lack of legitimacy and state building which is a problem that comes with the borders colonialists made (and you, as a nationalist, should agree that good borders and a nation state are necessary for state building and institution building). If you really want to know more, read some Jeffrey Sachs and read 'Why Nations Fail'. Conclusion is always that development aid _does_ help a lot.

Now that you mention it, the Chinese and the Europeans do have similar cultural posturing and superiority complexes. But Europeans also have a democratic tradition they take great pride in, so I thought they would be a bit more hesitant to work with the world's biggest dictatorship. Guess I was wrong.

&gt; Although the anti-Israel sentiment is something else and indeed disturbing.

It is. I'm starting to think that it's partly concealed antisemitism under the guise of being opposed to Israel's practices in Palestine. I don't agree with everything Israel does, but the constant torrent of condemnation is out of proportion to what Israel's actually doing. Just to put things into perspective, Israel has killed about 50,000 Palestinians in the span of 70 years, and from the amount of hate they get, you'd think they'd done a second Holocaust. Pakistan killed 300,000 to 500,000 Bangladeshis in just one year, and how much censure did they get for that? How many of the people who love to hate Israel *even know that the 1971 Bengal genocide happened?*

See [here](https://bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics.html) and scroll down to Persons in Institutions. In a given year around 8500 people spend time in prison, but less than half are incarcerated for more than a year and both numbers are on a decade long decline.

This makes Sweden's imprisonment rate around 43 per 100.000. You can see how that compares to other countries [here](http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison_population_rate?field_region_taxonomy_tid=14). 

They might use a different turning date in the year or their information might be outdated, but the reality is that the only countries with a better imprisonment rates are the ones that would be small cities or towns had they not be called Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein and the Faroe.

&gt;According to all projection scenarios, the Canadian population would continue to grow over the next 50 years, reaching between 40.0 million people and 63.5 million people by 2063. The level of variation across scenarios demonstrates the uncertainty inherent to population projections, and is linked to different assumptions about future fertility, mortality and migration levels. In the medium-growth scenario, the Canadian population would grow from 35.2 million people in 2013 to 51.0 million people by 2063.
&gt;
&gt;However, the rate of population growth would slow in the coming years according to the low- and medium-growth scenarios, as the contribution of natural increase (the difference between births and deaths) to population growth in Canada would diminish. Specifically, the number of deaths will increase in the next several decades as a result of population growth and aging.

A federal state is a central state. Once you lose control over the critical aspects of a state, like the military, currency, etc., you are not a real state. Look at the problems Greece and Italy are having since they gave up control over their own currencies.

But since the 80s virtually all the parties in Europe have become increasingly pro-market and socially liberal, so now they represent a very broad coalition of people with all kinds of intermediate views. 

Presently they tend to support levels of social spending and taxation that Americans would never tolerate. They prefer to raise it with less progressive taxes like VAT and spend it on services/pensions/insurance schemes rather than universal benefits. They aren't concerned with weird anti-environmentalist rhetoric like in the US. IMO they are more authoritarian and culturally conservative than the US right but in a more subtle way They're not interested in religious fundamentalism, they're more likely to ban you from painting your front door the wrong colour because it doesn't match the aesthetic of the city. They tend to accept immigration but not with great enthusiasm and they probably support assimilationist policies rather than multiculturalism.

180,"&gt; Would you like to explain what hapened ?

What happened is that North Korea invaded the South. China joined them later. Do I have to explain to you that one country invading another is an immoral action? You seem to understand that it's immoral when it's the US doing the invading, so it's quite bizarre that you don't understand it when it's NK and China doing it.

&gt; China just surpassed the US as economic power if I am not confused, so far they don't seem to be really stretching their muscle and tend to stick to extending their power through economics.

1. PPP GDP doesn't count; it's nominal GDP that counts.

2. China is still far behind the US in military power. Which is why they use economics at the moment. They are however rapidly building up their military to reach US levels. This is a classic Chinese strategy - become dominant without anyone noticing, then flex their muscles once they're too powerful for anyone to do anything about it. They already do it in Asia; you merely have the luxury of ignoring it because you live in Europe.

Here's a little lesson you ought to learn though - imperialism doesn't become right just because it's done through money than through force of arms. [Just ask the Sri Lankans who just had to give their port to the Chinese on a 99-year lease because they weren't able to pay the crushing debt they owed to China](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/chinas-creditor-imperialism/).

&gt; Even the terms of the 99-year Hambantota port lease echo those used to force China to lease its own ports to Western colonial powers. Britain leased the New Territories from China for 99 years in 1898, causing Hong Kong’s landmass to expand by 90%. Yet the 99-year term was fixed merely to help China’s ethnic-Manchu Qing Dynasty save face; the reality was that all acquisitions were believed to be permanent. Now, China is applying the imperial 99-year lease concept in distant lands.

183,"&gt; I haven't been alive for that long but I definitely have the impression media has gotten shittier.

I can address this.  News media *haven't* gotten shittier.  What's happened is that the ability of any individual to pick and choose only those news media sources that suit their particular political and social proclivities has vastly increased.  Combine that with the fact that there are vast social media networks using incredibly sophisticated algorithms that are meant not to inform, but rather, to capture attention by delivering media that feels good to individual users, and you have a perfect environment for the creation of ""siloed"" realities that deliver completely different ""facts"" to their respective residents.  

This differs from the past wherein only a few news media outlets were available to people and the choice to limit one's consumption of news to only those sources which were amenable to one's political and social leanings was accordingly much more constrained.  

The upshot is that we need to start teaching media literacy so that regular citizens have the tools to figure out when they are being fed bullshit, what reputable and ethical reporting looks like, and how to defend themselves against blatantly partisan propaganda.  The quality of news media itself hasn't really changed, it's just become so much more available that we are now obliged to take some personal responsibility, as citizens, for the choices we make with regard to our consumption.

&gt;Immigration: the boom (1990–2007) and recent trends (2008–2014)
&gt;
&gt;From the early 1990s, and most noticeably after 1997, Spain became a destination country for immigrants. Inflows increased steadily, from under 30 thousand per year in 1996 to 958 thousand in 2007, when foreigners amounted to more than 12 % of the total population (see Table 1). During the expansion, foreign immigrants were mostly Europeans, closely followed by Latin Americans (mostly Peruvians and Bolivians) and Africans (mostly Moroccans).

-

&gt;As for the impact of the crisis, there was a rise in the number of Spanish nationals returning from Asia and Africa, while in the case of Spaniards born abroad, the most noticeable development is a further increase in the share of immigrants from the Americas.

-

&gt;Emigration: the crisis (2008–2014)
&gt;
&gt;Migration outflows started to increase in 2007, and since 2010, outflows have amounted to more than 400 thousand per year (slightly below 1 % of the total domestic population), which is, both in absolute and relative terms, the highest level of emigration in Spanish history (Table 1). This is mostly due to the high mobility of foreign nationals. Indeed, they make up the great majority of migration outflows: in 2012, approximately 5 % of foreigners residing in Spain left the country, while less than 1 per thousand of Spaniards born in Spain emigrated. For the latter, migration outflows are still smaller than those registered in the 1960s,6 although between 2011 and 2014, outflows have not been offset by inflows, so Spain is now recording net migration outflows of nationals for the first time since the 1970s (net outflows in 2012 are estimated at around 70 thousand).
&gt;
&gt;Moreover, since 2007, there are also net migration outflows of Spanish-born Spaniards; the numbers are low, but migration outflows for this population group are accelerating. Preliminary data available for the first half of 2015 point to a further increase in exits, up to 32,980, while 51,267 was the number for the complete year 2014. Most foreigners went to Europe and South America, while Spaniards born in Spain overwhelmingly decide to migrate to Europe. Although the crisis has had little impact on the choice of destination countries for foreigners, in the case of Spaniards born in Spain, it has increased the share of outflows to Europe (mostly Germany and the UK) and to the USA.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7mt60z/2017_and_the_curious_demise_of_europes_centreleft/drxwpop/,vokegaf,1514609297

Either you're talking about an entirely different bombing that didn't drop an even similar amount of ordinance or you're using another source which is not recognized by law. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#Night_of_13/14_February 

"" There is some confusion in the primary sources over what was the target in Dresden, whether it was the marshalling yards near the centre or centre of the built up area. The report by the 1st Bombardment Division's commander to his commander states that the targeting sequence was the centre of the built up area in Dresden if the weather was clear. If clouds obscured Dresden but Chemnitz was clear, Chemnitz was the target. If both were obscured, they would bomb the centre of Dresden using H2X radar.[63] The mix of bombs for the Dresden raid was about 40% incendiaries—much closer to the RAF city busting mix than that the USAAF usually used in precision bombardment.[64] Taylor compares this 40% mix with the raid on Berlin on 3 February, where the ratio was 10% incendiaries. This was a common mix when the USAAF anticipated cloudy conditions over the target.[65]

316 B-17 Flying Fortresses bombed Dresden, dropping 771 tons of bombs.[66][67] The rest misidentified their targets. Sixty bombed Prague, dropping 153 tons of bombs on the Czech city while others bombed Brux and Pilsen.[67] The 379th bombardment group started to bomb Dresden at 12:17, aiming at marshalling yards in the Friedrichstadt district west of the city centre, as the area was not obscured by smoke and cloud. The 303rd group arrived over Dresden 2 minutes after the 379th found that their view was obscured by clouds so they bombed Dresden using H2X radar to target this location. The groups that followed the 303rd, (92nd, 306th, 379th, 384th and 457th) also found Dresden obscured by clouds and they too used H2X to locate the target. H2X aiming caused the groups to bomb inaccurately with a wide dispersal over the Dresden area. The last group to bomb Dresden was the 306th and they had finished by 12:30.[68]""",,/r/europe/comments/7mtydb/dresden_germany_in_the_wintertime/drxp46k/,drynoa,1514599239

238,"Well, with the Euro we kind of need some kind of a fiscal union anyway, our current economy is problematic because for some countries (Greece, Spain, Portugal) the Euro is too strong, for others it's too weak (Germany, Netherlands) and we do very little to consolidate this. In a lot of ways we are so close already that this is almost necesarry at some point. The concrete advantages are that there will be a more level playing field when it comes to helping the regions that are currently lacking behind, working together on taxes will be easier and we could finally put a stronger focus on global stuff and get a cross EU debate on it. 

But these are different steps towards something, it needs to be an organic process to really work. One of the things I consider important is the administrative dimension. A first step could be to simply make the EU parliament more significant overall and to make the elections a bigger event because currently the turnout is way too low and we fail to talk about a lot of important issues that impact all of the EU and that we need to work together on. So we need a closer political union. And I think the endgame of this is federalization with essentially the EU being a superstate with cooperations on the essentials and then on the other hand there will be strong regions with their own cultures and identities. 

You're right that Germany and France  grouping up would on one hand be a first step but on the other hand it would give the ability to be more stable towards the outside world already, it would allow us to share more already and would make us coordinate much, much better. I don't think this would work if we'd just say that it has to happen right now but I think there should be talk about the perspetive. Like for instance inniciating a process for a federation 15 years from now with lots of cultural exhange programms and a common debate that goes straight across the current border + a few political advancements (like increasing the funding of Arte, treating both french &amp; german news as national news and translating all major political speeches and events and then maybe a partly shared budget in some areas or maybe one or two shared ministries - like enviroment for instance). I think this would be less pressing for people if the message would merely be: We're gonna try to get closer and there is a distinct project on the horizon but it's not set in stone and can always be cancelled. I think we need more inniciatives like this because in every way how well we will do in the future depends on how well our neighbors do in the future, we are very small on a worldmap and we can't ignore this because the economy is in most ways quite global already. This means german economic polciy has a tremendous impact on France for isntance (and the other way around). This doesn't mean that we need a huge central state. That would destroy the cultures and would fall apart very quickly. However as I see it at least there are certain essentials that we need to work together on to at least find a common foundation. So the thing I'm proposing would essentially probably make us something inbetween the EU now and what most people think when they hear ""United States of Europe"" or a united french/german state. It would in the end be a state with a common budget, with common social security, with a common parliament with close cooperation on taxes (like finding a common minimum) and a country where what happens in Paris is as big a newsstory as what happens in Munich to me (the distance from where I live should be about the same). Still the individual regions should be very powerful and have the ability to shape the regions future the way the people there want it. So most of the effective administration and excecutive should absolutely be handled by the regions.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7mm8pa/germans_french_most_in_favor_of_a_united_states/drxpdaz/,tobias_681,1514599574

* Air leakage around windows, etc

* Off peak hour incentives

* Solar panel incentives / tax rebates

* Wattage Meter 

* Energy Star compliance incentives

Wattage meter is the most important by far imo. Reason being is you can see percisely how much wattage an item is using. Energy Star ratings will tell you and they're certified / legit but outside of US/Canada not every country has such standards so it's good to know. 

Solar panels like what Elon Musk is creating in California will be built into the actual tiles of the roof but for now ugly panels have to do.. but that's the second most important. 

Once you start monitoring it, for example on Amazon it's $26 to buy a wattage usage monitor meter, it becomes addictive. You actually save real money by knowing whats an energy hog and whats not. 

GE and others offer WiFi enabled smart lights, now those I don't believe are good. Reason being is that the cost to buy the item, cost to make the item in my opinion outweighs the cost of forgetting to turn off a light.

358,"&gt; Dresden has one of the highest birthrates in Germany.

No contradiction here.

&gt; By 2030 there will be fewer infants but significantly more
&gt; schoolchildren, adolescents, and young adults below
&gt; 25 years, according to Oertel. He expects an increase of this
&gt; age group of 25 % while the number of below two year-olds
&gt; will decrease by five percent yearly. Instead, in 2030 there will
&gt; be ten percent more elderly above 65 years. Life expextancy
&gt; will rise to 81.7 years for men and 86.4 years for women.

&gt; Bis 2030 wird es weniger Kleinkinder, dafür aber deutlich mehr Schulkinder, Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene bis 24 Jahre geben, so Oertel. Er geht von einer Zunahme in dieser Altersgruppe von 25 Prozent aus, während die Zahl der Unter-Zweijährigen um fünf Prozent sinkt. Dafür wird es 2030 zehn Prozent mehr Senioren im Alter über 65 Jahre in Dresden geben. Die Lebenserwartung steigt auf 81,7 Jahre bei Männer und 86,4 Jahre bei Frauen.

389,"&gt; So no reimbursement and no damages for the fact that they did NOT provide the service you hired them for? Even if the colis was actually value-less?

Well, yes, actually the costs of reobtaining and delivering your property to the intended recipient, with the possible alternative of reimbursement if you choose to go that route.

&gt; No. Even for stuff that as of today is not protected by warranty laws (e.g. bussines2bussines)

B2b has some of its own rules, some of the same rules, but the major difference is that they essentially can all be deviated from contractually, whereas in a b2c relationship you can not.

&gt; In fact, for many types of goods (I'd even say, for MOST types of goods) ""checking that what you buy is actually what you want"" involves destroying what you buy for testing, which is evidently not a sustainable proposition. 

Except it totally is? In a b2b relationship you can absolutely have a contract that essentially says ""I buy 10000 items of product X, untested from the production machine"", and if that is what is delivered, then any defects in the delivered product are the buyer's problem (unless it's fraud, like output from a known bad production run). Now, businesses won't usually sign such contracts, however the law doesn't limit their ability to do so, which is in contrast to b2c contracts, and that for a very good reason:

While businesses will usually not just buy stuff blindly (because that's risky), it's not uncommon to have a contract that specifies, for example, statistical rejection criteria. So, the contract may be along the lines of ""You deliver 10100 items of product X, I will select 100 of them and test them destructively, if more than two of them are defective, you have to take back your delivery and you don't get paid, otherwise I have to pay and get to keep all of it."" That is often more economical, and still has statistically well-defined risk for the buyer, but it would not be possible under b2c rules, and as it is hard to define exactly what a ""good"" contract would look like, it's instead basically unconstrained, with the assumption that people doing b2b contracts will know what  to do. The remaining constraints then are essentially criminal law.",,/r/europe/comments/7m7i23/psa_under_eu_rules_a_trader_must_repair_replace/drxk6zj/,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,1514592901

404,"&gt;I'd guess hitting the target is easier during daytime.

In the end, no, the RAF proved more accurate at night. That's because the RAF was forced to concentrate on electronic bombing aids, and developed the master bomber system to improve accuracy. The USAAF frequently used electronic bombing aids because the weather, and German smoke screens, made visual aiming difficult, but the USAAF never put the same effort into training for them. The USAAF also started flying at extreme altitudes to avoid German flak, and had a dramatic effect on accuracy.

Richard G Davis was the official historian of the USAF. His research show the RAF accuracy improved to exceed the USAAF's, which went backwards as the war went on. As the bombing was so heavily weighted towards the end of the war (half the bombs dropped on Germany were after Sept 1944), the RAF was more accurate overall.",,/r/europe/comments/7mtydb/dresden_germany_in_the_wintertime/drxd1vz/,WhiteSatanicMills,1514584159

Her daugher is by any means a german woman. No accent whatsoever. The only thing that is different is her looks and her name. She doesn't even speak another language but german.

We went on a roadtrip though germany. It was such an eye opener that there truely is open racism in the rural areas.

In Bavaria she tried to buy something in bakeries. Two times they completely ignored her and treated every other costumer but her. In another shop (and different village) every other customer was served and only after no one was left she got service. 

In a small restaurant they tried to ignore us and when i demanded service at the frontdesk i heard one guy say: ""What does he expect?"" 

The most shocking thing was that this treatment would have happened much, much more often if it weren't for her perfect german. Once she spoke and people heard her accent free language they opened up and acted all surprised and would suddenly be much more friendly.

We took it with a lot of humor but in retrospective it was quite terrible and we should have confronted each and every one of those racists. I think overall, during that 2 week roadtrip we had at least 7-8 of such things happen to her.

468,"&gt;Brits never actually accepted that they bombed cities and civilians as a whole. 

I'm pretty sure they did. They just pointed out that ""industrial cities"" were a valid target.

The USAAF used the same definition. From standing orders issued in 1944:

&gt;""No towns or cities in Germany will be attacked
as secondary or last resort targets, targets of
opportunity, or otherwise, unless such towns contain
or have immediately adjacent to them, one (1)
or more military objectives. Military objectives
include railway lines; junctions; marshalling yards;
railway or road bridges, or other communications
networks; any industrial plant; and such obvious
military objectives as oil storage tanks, military
camps and barracks, troop concentrations, motor
transport or AFV parks, ordnance or supply
depots, ammunition depots; airfields; etc.""

&gt;""It has been determined that towns and cities
large enough to produce an identifiable return on
the H2X scope generally contain a large proportion
of the military objectives listed above. These centers,
therefore, may be attacked as secondary or
last resort targets through the overcast bombing technique""

There isn't a town or city of any size in Europe that doesn't have a railway line or road bridge. 

The only difference is that whilst RAF records clearly show the tonnage they dropped on ""industrial cities"", the USAAF expunged their records at the end of the war and reclassified all their area attacks on German cities as attacks on ""marshalling yards"".",,/r/europe/comments/7mtydb/dresden_germany_in_the_wintertime/drxdm6s/,WhiteSatanicMills,1514584826

602,"&gt; Nationalism is pretty much the only thing that most of Pegida and the AfD have in common with fascism. 

The only reason those movements don't do the other things mentioned in your definition is because they don't have dictatorial power **yet**. 

Just because they don't tick all the boxes on your arbitrary checklist doesn't mean they aren't fascist.

Both AfD and especially Pegida have clear fascist tendencies. Ultra Nationalism, Xenephobia and outright racism and the fact that they use refugees as scapegoats for everything bad that ever happens qualifies them as fascists.

You wouldn't recognize fascism if it had a swastika tatooed on its forehead.

665,"&gt;look at the healthcare section. they rated estonia 5/10 even though estonia quite literally did nothing successfully in that area - and the website blatantly admits that.

No: 

&gt;What it achieved: Not much. Estonia didn’t aim high on health issues during its presidency.

This is far different than doing ""quite literally nothing"". And as said, health issues weren't a primary objective, then it's natural that much isn't achieved.

&gt;my point is that all the legwork was already done

What do you mean? Do you know anything about how things are done in the system?

&gt;and wouldve been completed even without an estonian presidency - any presidency for that matter.

I sure hope so, it would be shitty if the union ceased to work with just one member state gone...

&gt;you could dissolve the presidency concept and it would have been done anyway.

It would have been done by someone else then, a bigger European Council perhaps, but people don't want to give that much power to Brussels, so the EU has a rotating presidency. It's not supposed to create wonders like you think.

&gt;which in turn means that estonian presidency was worthless and achieved nothing.

In that sense the adjective ""Estonian"" can be omitted as you mean to say ""the presidency is worthless and achieves nothing"", although we both know this isn't true as you told ""it would have been done anyway"", which means there is some ""it"" that needs to be done.

The same way I can say the work of the cashiers is worthless and achieves nothing and anyone could do it instead of these cashiers, while it's clearly work and obviously someone else could also do it - it's just far from any reasonable point to make.

&gt;yep. that does tend to happen when a country is shitty to its own citizens.

I am an Estonian citizen. I don't the country is shitty to its own citizens. You are probably not, so why do you think that?

&gt;I'm pretty sure thats all of them.

All of them? You should contact some anti-corruption authorities and let them know. Don't forget to provide them your good evidence though.

&gt;im sorry but just because someone internally or via a poll measures corruption does not mean that the country isnt corrupt, it just means that they personally never encountered corruption.

It's pretty difficult not to encounter corruption if ""all the government institutions"" are corrupted, don't you think? And why don't you think it could work the same way for other countries, say France?

703,"Translation(Google translate):

The Government of Serbia has provided a million euros of assistance to Srebrenica from the budget reserve, and funds have been allocated for the purchase of premises and facilities in the business zone in Potocari, the Cabinet of the Mayor said.

The municipality said that this grant was granted to Srebrenica during a recent visit by the Mayor of Mladen Grujicic to Belgrade and talks with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

The funds are planned for the purchase of premises and facilities in the business zone in Potocari for a potential investor from Serbia who intends to start the production of chairs or for some other businessman willing to invest money and start production in these facilities, the Banja Luka media reported.

The head of the Cabinet of the Mayor Vladan Milovanovic explained that the estimated value of this area and facilities is around 850,000 euros and that around 150,000 euros are needed for the rehabilitation and arrangement of facilities and sites in order to become functional for starting up production.

Milovanovic says that a potential investor from Serbia is interested in starting the production of chairs and initially employing 70, and in the prospect of about 300 workers.

That space and facilities were once owned by the transport company ""Srebrenica Transport"", which was purchased by Bobar from Bijeljina in the privatization process, to be sold later to the Slovenian company Neo Dom.

After the privatization, all the equipment from these facilities was sold and disposed of, and no production for 15 years was initiated, although several times it was announced that this would be done.

The buildings have been empty for years and the area around them has been neglected and healed in weeds and plants.

Two years ago, the then prime minister and now the president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, pledged to help Srebrenica worth 5 million euros and this promise was realized.

At the end of 2015, two million euros were paid to the municipal budget for debt settlement, payment of judgments and budget reimbursement, and three million euros were paid later for infrastructure projects that are being implemented this year and the works on the facilities covered by these projects are brought to an end.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/7mv0tt/serbia_donates_1000000_euros_to_srebrenica/drwty62/,buttlickk,1514562545

Like, for example, Beerfests where people dress in Bavarian costumes and sing folksongs? Or, like, in my region we have thematic Siberian village, with stuff dressed in national costumes? Or like in Rome where there are plenty of people in tourist locations dressed in legionnaire uniform?

881,"&gt; We know that God is a spiritual being and does not possess physical characteristics. This does not limit, however, how God may choose to reveal Himself to humanity. Scripture contains all the revelation God gave to humanity about Himself, and so it is the only objective source of information about God. In looking at what Scripture tells us, there are several observations of evidence about the form in which God revealed Himself to humanity.

&gt; Scripture contains approximately 170 references to God as the “Father.” By necessity, one cannot be a father unless one is male. If God had chosen to be revealed to man in a female form, then the word “mother” would have occurred in these places, not “father.” In the Old and New Testaments, masculine pronouns are used over and over again in reference to God.

&gt; Jesus Christ referred to God as the Father several times and in other cases used masculine pronouns in reference to God. In the Gospels alone, Christ uses the term “Father” in direct reference to God nearly 160 times. Of particular interest is Christ’s statement in John 10:30: “I and the Father are one.” Obviously, Jesus Christ came in the form of a human man to die on the cross as payment for the sins of the world. Like God the Father, Jesus was revealed to humanity in a male form. Scripture records numerous other instances where Christ utilized masculine nouns and pronouns in reference to God.

&gt; The New Testament Epistles (from Acts to Revelation) also contain nearly 900 verses where the word theos—a masculine noun in the Greek—is used in direct reference to God. In countless references to God in Scripture, there is clearly a consistent pattern of His being referred to with masculine titles, nouns, and pronouns. While God is not a man, He chose a masculine form in order to reveal Himself to humanity. Likewise, Jesus Christ, who is constantly referred to with masculine titles, nouns, and pronouns, took a male form while He walked on the earth.

887,"&gt;On the one hand, trying for a more balanced non-EU immigration profile that isn't 75%+ from the Muslim world during their equivalent of the European Wars of Religion makes sense

Sure. But it only makes sense if you assume that what you call the Muslim War of Religion is doomed to break out into violence. And I'm not sure that's true in Europe, since I'm not aware of any Sunni-on-Shia or Shia-on-Sunni hate crimes. All of the Muslim terrorism is Muslim-on-Christian/Atheist/Agnostic 

&gt; countries have the right to establish and protect a variety of national languages, cultures, and even genetic lines 

Sure, but there's not a non-racist of protecting your ""genetic lines"". Like, that's straight out of apartheid South Africa. And if your language and culture can't handle that, for example, 30 or 40% of the population in a country is immigrants, I'm not sure that it should be preserved. Especially in a globalized world, where people feel less and less attached to their home country. 

&gt; as the far right grows more entwined with boorish xenophobia 

I'm not sure that I would use ""grows more"" in this instance, since boorish xenophobia is intristic to the nationalist far right. 

&gt;and with corporate kleptocapitalists on both sides of the Atlantic (many European right-wing ""populists"" are in bed with large corporations in their country as well as with Wall Street and Trump)

I don't think this is true. I actually think that Trump is the exception here. AFAIK, neither Le Pen, Wilders, FPÖ or AfD are particularly Wall Street friendly. Le Pen ran very much to the left on Macron fiscally, and DF in Denmark is basically a xenophobic version of the Social Democrats 

&gt;And also, this same impulse of nationalism can go beyond principled opposition to mass immigration - finding enemies where they don't exist. Hungary, Poland, and Japan are not at all immune from right-wing populism in spite of their homogeneity; it's just that they instead channel it on finding ""enemies"" abroad.

I can agree with that. See: Trumps attacks on the media. 

&gt;TL;DR - There's nothing wrong with taking any side on the immigration debate. The problem is that the current hard right is not composed of principled nationalists but instead is riddled with hateful thugs who are obsessed with finding scapegoats.

In Italy there might not be too many regions that want to distance themselves from Italian and therefore they don’t mind having the status of a dialect.

Another example: Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian etc. are pretty much all mutually intelligible and differ *very* little from each other, but yet they are classified as different languages because those countries don’t really like each other and don’t want to be associated with each other.

Try living here... Then you might actually get your facts straight.

A lot of people in the Netherlands are completely fine with Dutch dying out and being replaced with English in the long term because it's kind of an ugly language.

It has its charms though grammatically and has a couple of very interesting and unusual features amongst Indo-European languages that are worth studying.

940,"&gt; I’d guess that the biggest issue has become immigration, and in the eyes of many former centre-left voters, their traditional parties are “on the wrong side of history” (to quote barrack Obama).

This probably applies to most European countries but not to Spain at least, where inmigration is not an issue at all for most people.

Here the collapse of the centre-left came in 2 phases:

* After the crisis hit, the left wing government handled it in an absolutely atrocious way. Unemployment skyrocketed, the economy went into recession for 2 years, etc. This made the left wing incumbent suffer the 2nd largest drop in Spanish history, from 44% to 29%.

* After that, it never really recovered. The right wing incumbent government also suffered a lot because of the crisis, but that didn't help the left wing opposition in the slightest. They were seen both as basically the same, both had huge corruption scandals, etc. Most of the drop went to third parties

After the 2014 EU parliament elections the entire landscape changed dramatically and Spain broke the 2 party system. A left wing government was a possibility for a while, but the 2015 general elections gave an unmanagble parliament and the 2016 ones were a win for the right, which recovered quite a bit. In fact the centre-left party (PSOE) was widely expected to come third, but in the end they narrowly managed to stay in second.

As of now, considering the current polling averages, things aren't looking too good but still better than 2016. PSOE has consolidated as the main left wing force but the downside is that even though the futher left Podemos has dropped, they haven't collected a single vote from them, most seem to be going to the abstention. If the vote splits right down the middle for the right there might be a possibility of a PSOE-Cs (liberals) government, but it's extremely unlikely.",Spain (Canary Islands),/r/europe/comments/7mt60z/2017_and_the_curious_demise_of_europes_centreleft/drwlo3v/,tack50,1514548608

There is a reason it exists. It can be canceled but you run the risk of giving smugglers another Merkel esque beacon call saying ""the channel is free"". Outside the EU, there wouldn't even be a need for rhetorical solidarity and France would have two crises, one at their Mediterranean border another at their coast. Nobody wants to give an excuse for an uptick in dangerous migrant crossings into Europe. 


It also can't be cancelled immediately, it has a two year delay mechanism. So this crisis will slowly build up on the French coast while the treaty is still active. So it gives time for the UK to prepare steps to limit the problem to the coast. 

From the UK perspective once out of the EU, it can decide to simply deny entry to as many as possible, returning them back. Some of course will slip through, but the humanitarian disaster will be at Calais and on the French coast. This is one of the advantages of being an island.

Looking at the most common causes for terrorism,

* Our far right wing is weak - there's a strong historical distaste for nazism and a lack of any distinct ethnic minorities to get mad at, our far right is usually just brooding about ""the evils of the homosexual EU""

* Basically no far left at all as the majority of our recent history is just ""hey yeah communism isn't all that great"" and the only people that want it back are generally really old and are living off of pensions anyway, and the ""college leftists"" we have mostly identify with the liberal parties as the left wing here seems to be more concerned with pensioners and is generally unpopular with young voters, and if anyone is displeased with the socioeconomic state here they just migrate to Ireland or something (which happens A LOT)

* No Islamic presence as there's no real reason for anyone of Islamic faith to end up here, there's a total of 4 mosques in Lithuania apparently (as opposed to 885 churches), almost all of the Islamic refugees that came to Lithuania only came all the way up here because they wanted to end up in Sweden

* No separatist attacks as all the sizeable ethnic minorities here are either Polish or Russian and if they wanted to live in a state of their own they could probably just go to Poland or Russia

* Basically no global political influence. No foreign force really cares much about Lithuania aside from our neighboring states. I don't think anybody in the middle east is thinking ""I really fucking hate Lithuanian imperialism"".

At anything else what?

&gt;plus some of this stuff would have been picked up by a more competent country and they would have done far more than estonia.

This sounds more like wishful thinking. What exactly is a more competent country? A bigger country? A country with more people working in the public sector, in its diplomatic corps?

&gt;well yeah only ours is retarded enough to think it can stop alcohol consumption.

I didn't even know this was among the issues on the table. Perhaps you shouldn't concentrate on that so much?

&gt;i did read. and from what i can see estonia did quite literally nothing.

I'm pretty sure politico would have graded Estonia 0/10 if it had done literally nothing...

&gt;quite literally all of this from what i can tell are long standing negotiations that just happened to be done when estonia had its presidency.

How do you think these negotiations happen? Who does the preparatory work? Who organizes the meetings? Who leads the meetings? What do you think the presidency is about? The presidency does not make insightful decisions of its own. The presidency is not the rotating government of the EU, presidency is chairmanship. 

&gt;this would have happened with quite literally any other country

Yes, other parts of Europe have no names that would appear on this map.

- Germany is mapped better in OpenStreetMap than other part of Europe and as result names from this region are overrepresented. Better processing may fix this issue.
- German-speaking area has more hills and mountains than other language areas
- German-speaking areas tend to use the same name for many peaks

1164,"&gt;really? what issues were there with Russia in 1999?

A better part of a century of threatening and invasions. Sovereign states wanted assurances.

&gt;Look at Finland they only ever have issues with Russia when Nato membership is brought up

Because Russia starts to threaten when Finland is thinking about a military alliance. Russia is directly using the divide and conquer principle. Finland is a sovereign state and I hope it will join NATO, but it's up to them and Russia has no say on the matter.

&gt;it's why most Finns don't support membership

You don't understand Finnish history.

&gt;they see no benefit to worsening relations with Russia when they feel like Russia isn't a threat to them

If good relations with Russia depend on Finland staying out of a defensive organization, then Russia is just a bad neighbour and a bully.

&gt;no they were legitimately good like seriously you're the only person who denies this

lol

&gt;most I have seen look at Yeltsin and say something about how we all got along under him

This is simplistic.

&gt;how is that shill move? it's what the Russians literally have said

Because they are brainwashed people.

&gt;and guess what Russia has generally little issue with Finland

Aside from illegally invading them and stealing their territory? Like wtf...

&gt;that's not shilling that's presenting an opinion try again

And opinions can be retarded.

&gt;Germans passed a bill to apologize to the Spanish about the Condor legion so yeah no 5% is a little generous there

And it's still irrelevant to the question at hand.

&gt;and that once again goes back to my original point it's over it's done get over it.

That's not how anything works. Why are you like this? Why are you supporting Russia? It's pathetic.

&gt;If Russia said ""We occupied you"" would it improve your life?

No, it would put that question at bay.

&gt;Will it change anything about the reality of what happened? No it will not

So if I murder your mother, will me admitting my crime and getting punished bring her back? You should then also let go as soon as it's done. After all, I'm a good person now, at least I claim to be.

&gt;like what? seriously man what type of influence is illegal?

Organizing a smearing campaign against some political candidates for example. Threatening to cut of gas supplies if you vote differently in some aspect etc.

&gt;direct action is illegal like if Russia did a coup to place some guy in the Ukrainian presidency sure that's wrong but if they used media they own to convince the people to vote for their guy, it's shity but it's not illegal

Russia is an undemocratic state that controls its media. Countries generally don't tolerate other countries influencing their elections, especially dictatorships.

&gt;Only a Balt would argue that devastation from the deadliest war of all time is somehow better than having Soviet built infrastructure which may or may not be useful in a market economy.

I am not a Balt...

And this Soviet-built infrastructure scenario also included devastation from the deadliest war of all time...

&gt;And modern Latvia is a better place to be than France was in 1971(26 years later) so it seems like, Most Devastating War of all time &lt; Socialist Infrastructure

This is such a shill argument. Why would you even go that way? Isn't that inherently pathetic?

Is really the only way for you to make excuses for the Soviets to compare their rule with World War II destruction? Latvia had better infrastructure in 1991 than France in 1945, yes.

According to this, about 20% of the people in your calculation are inactive. I also estimate that another 20% don’t pay the full amount into the pension system, as they’re part timers or work lower paying jobs. This alone would increase your ration from 2.8 to roughly 4.

Second, you don’t seem to understand. If there is one elderly person and they need 4 people to maintain their standard of living, those 4 need 16 when they retire. Those 16 need 64. Do you see the issue now with not reforming the system?

Third, when I said humans are more than numbers I meant as follows- Each of us has unique feelings, thoughts, dreams and needs. We have different cultures, religions, social norms and eating habits. We also have different hatred and prejudices. There is no magic dust that automatically makes all this null and void as soon as an immigrant steps foot in a new land. This is evident not just in non-whites, but fellow European migrants.

We have no overarching American identity in Europe. There is no big dream to assimilate into. I said before, we are a continent of ETHNIC based nation states.

What you’re saying is simply not possible in Europe, even if we accepted the fact that migrants are economically necessary.

1327,"Because if Finland would give away its independence to USE, with or without public vote, the result would be messy.

In fact, I would argue that if 51% of Finns would vote to join the USE, it would be even worse, because then it would be an actual civil war. Our first civil war was for the very same reason, deep national divide between reds and whites. If 10% supported it, and then Finland would just join without vote, it would be a lot cleaner, like a simple coup detat.

And I'm not going to get my guns, because I don't own a gun. But even a complete idiot should realize that this is a collective suicide for the EU and EU-nations as a whole, last thing you want is 52% support for something like this or forcing it without vote.

Yeah, the 51-55% support would work in places like Belgium, Germany, France, Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and possibly Spain, but only because their nationalism is about net zero, and the rest half of the population would not give enough shits to do anything radical, with the exception of protests.

But that's the thing, South &amp; Central-Europeans will never realize how incredibly strong force the nationalism is in the east and north, and that this shit would never work there, or here. 

It is not something that you can just get rid of. Just ask Jugoslavia and Soviet Union. They tried. 

Also partly because most of EE and north was occupied by other nations for fuck knows how long, and that most of them &amp; us have no desire to get to that stage once again.

Either it was the Nazis themselves, USSR, empires like Ottomans, Austro-Hungarians or Jugoslavia, either way it ain't gonma happen again.

No.  I already went over this in my earlier post.

&gt; It is not that anyone imagines the law to be just. Everyone knows that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. But no one accepts the implications of this, everyone takes it for granted that the law, such as it is, will be respected, and feels a sense of outrage when it is not.

You don’t understand. With a sub 2.1 fertility rate, each generation is smaller.  Meaning that the cohort of older people will only increase as time goes on. Immigrants also age, and also have a sub-replacement fertility rate by the second generation. You need to sit down, and reason this out. You need more and more immigrants to support a growing population of old people. 

You claim countries are doing this, and sure, you’re right. Now name me one country in the west that doesn’t have a large populist party. Your country just voted in a destabilizing populist, and his replacement could very well be another populist, of the left wing type.

I love how you use the UK as an example. Brexit was in large part due to the same immigration pressures that brought Trump to power. Thanks tho Brexit, the European project itself is at risk.

1392,"&gt;this reads as good engineering,

No, its the complete opposite. Speed and response times are very important to users, slowing that down doesnt make the experience better, it makes it worse. Especially when Apple specifically make the battery difficult and expensive to replace.  You're looking at one specific aspect of the 'upgrade' and ignoring the rest. To make a computer system markedly SLOWER simply because you've specifically made the battery hard to replace, even moreso when you dont tell the user, is terrible engineering. No one says 'hmmm..this phone is sluggish and slow, I'd better change the battery', they say '..I'd better get a new phone'.

Although I dont have much sympathy for Apple buyers in the first place theres a fairly clear expectation from the market that you dont secretly sabotage your products to persuade people to get new ones.

Companies that operate transnationaly can easily outmaneuver or blackmail single countries or play them against each other for their own benefit and this is taking a toll social capitalism. Protectionism isn't going to fix that, it will only kill the local economy by making it incompetetive to foreign competition.

The are seven noun entries, one of which references the Icelandic *stæði*. The verb entry is just a reference to *stydja*:

&gt; støda v. II. (d) (el. stø ) = stydja (s.d.), S.

Of the verb forms, only *stø* has survived into modern Nynorsk (my Nynorsk dictionaries that follow the 1959 reform don’t have *støda* and *stydja* either). The noun *støde* has become *støe* (ON *-stǿði*). The verb *stǿða* (PGmc *stōdijaną*) has survived as both *stø* and *støe* in Bokmål.

[Norsk Ordbok 2014](http://no2014.uib.no/), which is heavily based on Grunnmanuskriptet and, fortunately, not on the official orthography, has all three verb forms (*støda* and *stydja* point to *stø*). The documented dialectal forms show that at least some dialects seem to have both verbs (*stø* and *støya*/*støja*, preterite forms *støa* and *studde*/*stydde*), for example the halling-valdris dialect (Hallingdal/Hemsedal, Valdres). The extremely conservative dialect in [Valle](http://www.vallemal.no/details.jsp?detail_id=5274&amp;Search=null) appears to follow the same pattern as Jamtish, taking the infinitive and present forms from stǿða (*stǿ* – *stǿr* sg. / *stǿ* pl.) and the past forms from *styðja* (*studde*/*studdi*, *stutt*).",,/r/europe/comments/7guou9/today_iceland_celebrates_99_years_of_sovereignty/drw22vx/,gjest,1514512703

Now this estimate assumes that washers are a consumable item, and clearly they are not.  An individually owned washer will last 15-20 years, at several uses per week.

&gt;Politicians and intellectuals denounce Austrian government

&gt;The ""Nazi hunters"" Beate and Serge Klarsfeld, a former foreign minister and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate: in a letter they all call for a boycott of the new Austrian government with the participation of the FPÖ.

&gt;In a joint letter, former foreign ministers and intellectuals from all over the world called for the new Austrian government to be condemned and for the country's upcoming EU presidency to be boycotted next year.

&gt;This is due to the involvement of the right-wing populist Freedom Party (FPÖ). European ministers should not receive FPÖ ministers, according to the appeal published by the newspaper LeMonde.fr on Thursday.

&gt;""We do not turn away our gaze: these are the heirs of National Socialism who came to power in the new Austrian government,""the signatories explained. These include the Franco-German couple Beate and Serge Klarsfeld, known as ""Nazi hunters"", former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, Spanish ex-Foreign Minister Miguel-Angel Moratinos, Canada's former Prime Minister Kim Campbell and Nobel Peace Prize laureate José Ramos-Horta.

&gt;They denounce the ""culpable silence and apathy"" that met the inauguration of the FPÖ ministers. Moreover, the signatories ""reject the idea that the expansion of nationalism and the end of democracy are inevitable and that action against the heirs of National Socialism is futile, not to say illegal"".

&gt;The protests and criticism against the FPÖ's participation in government have been restrained so far - unlike 17 years ago. In 2000, a first coalition of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the FPÖ had provided for a joint protest of the other EU states. They severely curtailed their bilateral relations with Vienna.

&gt;The new coalition of the right-wing Conservative People's Party (ÖVP) and the FPÖ started work on 18 December. The right-wing populists hold six ministerial posts, including Home Affairs, Defence and External Affairs. 

&gt;EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he would ""measure the new government against its actions"" and welcomed its announcement that it would pursue a pro-European course. In the second half of 2018 Austria takes over the EU Council presidency.

The union was also very benefitial to us, Scottish men made up a lot of the governorship during the Empire and benefitted from the slave trade. So there is an economic factor that contributed to this.

We have also all fought and died together in wars, this creates a strong sense of brotherhood. Having one armed forces helps creates a British indentity.

The most commonly used measure of life expectancy is at birth (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. Cohort LEB is the **mean** length of life of an actual birth cohort (all individuals born a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born many decades ago, so that all their members have died. Period LEB is the **mean** length of life of a hypothetical cohort assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.

As far as I'm aware, *mean* and *median* are two completely different things and *mean* and *average* are synonymous.

The report further determined that Bosnian Croat forces had also carried out policies of ethnic cleansing targeted principally at Muslims, but also Bosnian Serb populations, but on a significantly lesser scale than the Bosnian Serbs and their allies. Finally, it found while Bosnian government forces (largely Muslim) had engaged in practices that constituted grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, they had no policy of ethnic cleansing and did not carry out such operations

really? what issues were there with Russia in 1999?

Look at Finland they only ever have issues with Russia when Nato membership is brought up, it's why most Finns don't support membership they see no benefit to worsening relations with Russia when they feel like Russia isn't a threat to them

no they were legitimately good like seriously you're the only person who denies this most I have seen look at Yeltsin and say something about how we all got along under him

how is that shill move? it's what the Russians literally have said and guess what Russia has generally little issue with Finland and Sweden two non Nato states



&gt;Here you go




that's not shilling that's presenting an opinion try again





&gt;Germans might take it 5% too far, but Russians are 80% lacking in their coping with their history... And not admitting they occupied us is no small issue, how do you not get that?





Germans passed a bill to apologize to the Spanish about the Condor legion so yeah no 5% is a little generous there and that once again goes back to my original point it's over it's done get over it. If Russia said ""We occupied you"" would it improve your life? Will it change anything about the reality of what happened? No it will not






&gt;This is the sixth time I have to give you a notice. And there is no ""act of trying to influence"". Influencing might be through different acts, some of which are legal and some of which are illegal.




like what? seriously man what type of influence is illegal? direct action is illegal like if Russia did a coup to place some guy in the Ukrainian presidency sure that's wrong but if they used media they own to convince the people to vote for their guy, it's shity but it's not illegal

1691,"You need to doubt more then.

""European nations moving together independent from America"" is obviously a valuable project that requires military might in order to reassure Eastern European countries, but that's not what this postcard shows. It shows antisemitism and reeks of acceptance for Nazi Germany. Vichy was not your regular government, it was a regime in which Pétain had more power than Louis XIV, the monarch who concentrated the most power in all history of France, and his project was to zealously cooperate with Hitler so that pretty please France could get to pick up the scraps of Nazi Germany. He did not intend to build the European project this postcard shows. He thought that Hitler would rule long term and that he could convince him to let France be the second, vassal power in dominating Europe. Hitler didn't give a shit about him. No dominant person gives a shit about guys who think like that.

By the way he arguably acquired full power over Southern France unconstitutionally, as the Constitution did not permit that the Republic be ended, which effectively did happen as Pétain removed Parliament. On top of being an illegitimate dictator with a pathetic and unrealistic project, Pétain was old enough that he actually started to downright lose his mind in 1946 (or was it 49). There is no way he could have ever built anything to be celebrated for, and this is before we account for Hitler who didn't care about sharing and making a shiny united community of European nations, he wanted Germany to be a vast empire.

&amp;nbsp;

But Nazi Germany could only lose with Russia and the US coming from both sides anyway. Had lines stabilized as is in 1940, which is impossible, the European project you speak about in soft terms would actually be the Nazi German empire, something that can never be ""undoubtedly shared by many Europeans"" (WTF). Just in France alone, it is unthinkable that Germany would have been able to keep the North with the benediction of the French people.

1706,"&gt; I wonder why so many people are unhappy then that things like Brexit or Donald Trump could happen. Almost makes you think that free trade does leave people worse off sometimes.

because of cultural resentment and xenophobia, not because of econ policies. Compared to Trump and the Tories I'm basically a communist. 

&gt;And it may threaten jobs of workers in both countries. Well paid, secure jobs, if I may add that. People who loose their jobs are not very good consumers. Or very moderate voters, for that matter.

Trade creates jobs, it doesn't destroy them. That some people temporarily lose jobs in a free economy, that's good, not bad. In living economies companies lose out and new companies win. That's the sign of a healthy market

&gt;(I wonder why?)

Because for people to agree on something negotiation has to happen without interference. That's why politicians negotiate coalition agreements or nuclear deals in private before they go public with their results. After a trade agreement is negotiated however, it is public for years until it is ratified.

1924,"&gt;actual AT weapons (modern ones are surprisingly rare) and trained soldiers to man them

Everything over RPG-7 is considered modern. So you could say they are not that rare.

&gt;land vehicles to launch them (which can be destroyed by tanks)

They cant. system like that if often beyond tanks range. Spike ERs range is 8km while 120/L55 is 5km.

&gt;In almost all of these cases, you need to have active homing. You constantly adjust the course of either wired or wireless missile traveling towards a tank that is actively evading or jamming the missile in flight, and returning fire at you. Would you be the brave guy that would shoot the missile, while the smoke engulfs you, and continue homing it while the tank is aiming at you?  

What is this 70s? 

&gt;Even if the missile hits, the kill isn't guaranteed. Modern tanks have almost 1m thick reactive armor (it explodes right before impact to deflect the blast energy from the tank) and many other secret goodies that we don't even know about. 

Only Frontaly. When it comes to new systems they often come at slight angle attacking mainly roof of the tank.

&gt;You can either do that, or just send your own tanks against the enemy ones.

Ukraine shows that it's much better to call artillery. Days where tanks fought tanks are over. Now tanks are only used to temporary advantage that will allow to break front.

Do you have any source to back that up or are you just making stuff up?

One small federal government primarily concerned with the protection of external borders, inside safety and efficient judicial system. One congress comprised of 2 representatives of each member state, and one president elected by the people through electoral college, which ensures small states are not ignored and have equal representation.

Neither?

IMHO it has more to do with the fact that there haven't been any major wars/invasions for the last 1000 years or so (even more, I'd say), that's why there's still lots of historical buildings to see (with the exception of Northern France which has been devastated in WW1, but maybe that's the reason why foreign tourists don't visit that area). The same goes for most of Italy, where only the monastery of Monte Cassino has been razed to the ground during WW2, otherwise you can find a 1200s or 1300s church in almost any remote Italian small city. Actually, I think Italy looks better from an architectural pov compared to France because they didn't have the French Revolution, when lots and lots of old/medieval churches had been demolished or left abandoned to the elements by the French authorities.

No, it was linked to the migration issue. It was plastered all over in billboards, debates on the question of what happens when the asylum seekers attain citizenship.

2244,"From El País:

'You might have thought that in a year when Brexit is turning Britain upside down, the most re-tweeted article in the UK’s most prestigious financial paper, The Financial Times, would be about British Prime Minister Theresa May, the former leader of the right-wing UKIP party Nigel Farage or foreign secretary Boris Johnson. Or perhaps it would be about the European Union – often accused of blocking the financial divorce settlement between the UK and Brussels. But you would be wrong.

The subject of the FT’s most re-tweeted article in 2017 was none other than ousted former Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont, dismissed from his post after Madrid used emergency powers enshrined in the Spanish Constitution in response to the Catalan regional parliament‘s passing of a unilateral declaration of independence on October 27.

And those re-tweeting the November 2 attack on the Catalan leader – who fled to Belgium after the vote of the independence declaration and faces arrest on possible rebellion charges should he return to Spain – are a very large number of unwitting separatists.

“The world has a new and heroic freedom fighter. De Gaulle, Gandhi, Mandela and now Carles Puigdemont,” wrote FTEditorial Director Robert Shrimsley who has a weekly satirical column in the paper known for its unusual pink color.

Delighted to see the name of their ex-president alongside some of history’s most distinguished figures, Eurodeputy Ramon Tremosa and the singer songwriter-cum deputy in the regional Catalan parliament Lluis Llach tweeted the article without looking too closely at the content.

Tremosa and Llach saw no hint of irony in the comparison between Puigdemont and De Gaulle who lead the French Resistance, Gandhi – the Indian pacifist who got the British out of India – and Mandela, the South African leader who beat apartheid. But they were not alone. Other Catalan independence supporters began re-tweeting it liberally as if it were an international endorsement of separatism, sending it to the top of the FT’s viral charts for 2017.

The article sends up Puigdemont with an imaginary conversation between him and his aide:

“Ah Barcelona, will I ever see Las Ramblas again?” says the ex-premier.

“We can have you back there in hours. We could return — like Lenin. A sealed train to the Perpignan Station,” the aide replies referring to the Soviet leader‘s famous 1917 return to Russia after exile in Switzerland. 

The conversation continues in this vein with Puigdemont saying: “I would need guarantees.”

To which the aide replies: “What, like a good buffet car? We will get no guarantees. Did Gandhi have guarantees?”

During the dialogue the aide suggests that Puigdemont should consider imprisonment: “Because we’re separatists, not fiscal autonomists,” he says. “What did you expect? Nothing worth winning is painless.”

“No one mentioned pain,” Puigdemont replies. “Pain wasn’t in the plan. I was supposed to threaten independence — go down in the history of Catalonia and then negotiate more devolution with Madrid. I would have streets named after me, hang out with [FC Barcelona soccer player] Lionel Messi. That was the deal. Now I’ve got the police wanting to arrest me for sedition and my supporters want to hang me from a lamppost.”

Despite pending judicial proceedings against him, Puigdemont stood as the candidate for the separatist  Junts per Catalunya in the recent Catalan elections. The party surprised many to become the most-voted independence group, picking up 34 seats in the 135-seat Catalan parliament.'

2251,"I always wondered why there's such a huge disparity between east and west in life expectancy nowadays. I mean, I know that I can't generalise but all old people I know, including my great-grandparents and the people in my grandparents' village, but also the ones I worked with when I was volunteering as a social assistant were all past the 80 years mark. I can consider my family an anomaly, as most of them lived to 94 or more, but even those unrelated to me were all past 80 and going strong. Not to mention that they were born a long time ago (obviously), when the life expectancy was even lower because of wars, famine, bad healthcare and so on. So how come that the life expectancy of someone born today is lower than that? Not a lot has changed that could be considered negative to one's health. There are no wars, no  shortage of food, better healthcare, more and more campaigns to live a healthy and active life, etc. Plus, living abroad for a few years has put me in contact with old people from the west as well and I can't really say that they are healthier or that their life-expectancy should be so much better. I think it's a bit weird, since this map seems to favour people with more disposable income, but you can have all the money in the world and still get sick at a very early age. East Europe from what I know has an universal healthcare system as well, so they don't really need to pay for treatment either.

You cant phisically keep them out of Europe, we have been fighting this for decades, they cross the mediterranean on wood or inflatable boats, most of them drowned trying it, they try to jump borders like ours in hundreds and at this rate they will try in thousands, recently they are assaulting the border pass, which thousands of people cross everyday to trade, you want to close it?

My point is: **it can be done** but apparently caring about people that are not catalan and trying to work together for a greater good is not on the pro independence to-do list.

&gt; 43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor[a] and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,[b] 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet your brethren[c] only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors[d] do so? 48 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

This is literally what their holy book says. I'm not really surprised the churches are left-wing. This describes the pro-refugee people perfectly.

By the reading of this, if the churches aren't a) firmly in the ""refugees welcome"" camp, and b) stay there no matter how badly the migrants behave and no matter how badly people exploit the system, then they are hypocrites.

ECB lending money for lower than market rates is not an issue until one of the Eurozone countries who had borrowed bankrupts. Then other EZ countries will lose their lendings without even getting premium for the risk. Thus it's called subsiding. IMHO it's big issue that countries with lower debt have to subsidize those with higher.

It doesn't mean there will be similar crisis, probably ECB would start buying Italian debt right away this time.

Nono, outside Catalonia, whether Catalans or Spaniards or others.

&gt;Even in case if a certain sub region would vote overwhelmingly in favor of remaining a part of Spain?

Question is what forms a subregion and what not. We could go crazy creating urban enclaves based on a dozen people's support, but Catalonia as a whole is what forms a distinct region. Its capital region should not get to have a different say than the rural region - their votes should count as a general result, whether in favour of independence or against.

&gt;I dont think that you would need a really high quorum like 90%, but it makes sense to me that particularly in such important decisions there should be some sort of quorum

That quorum would always be very arbitrary, that's the problem.

Nono, I am talking of real, binding, definite referendums that have a decent campaigning period, not the farce type of referendum that already happened in Catalonia.

If it's not the same why did *you* bring up political ideologies?, you used it as a comparison. 

&gt; This doesn't change anything. The comparison you're making doesn't hold. The ""extremist"" part isn't policing thought, but violence. This carries over to banning neither ideologies nor religions as a whole. Both Germany and France guarantee religious freedom and association.

And neither is not allowing mosques to be built policing thought either. 


&gt; This is not true. With the exception of Germany and Austria, this is false. And they have the one exception. Ideologies as a whole aren't banned (again, with the mentioned exception) and people are free to associate with whomever they want as long as they don't directly threaten the legal order.

Yes and Islam as a whole isn't banned if mosques aren't built or islamic organizations are banned.

And what qualifies as threatening the legal order, one can make the case that Islam does this, it's really up for a society to decide.

&gt; What Greece does is to preach and re-enforce the supremacy of one religion, just like islamists want to. You don't get to call that equality. That would logically permit Saudi Arabia to claim the same thing.

2626,"&gt;Maybe we haven’t stabilized because we bring in so many immigrants.

I mean, I could see that as a hypothesis if fertility had collapsed in the wake of the migrant crisis, but it doesn't explain Europe's extensive period of low fertility predating that, when there wasn't a lot of immigration.

&gt;When the population level starts to decline, people will be able to attain the standard of living that they want

So, two caveats.

First, historically, our great-grandparents were statistically a lot poorer in real terms.  But they were doing just fine having kids.  So that makes a ""higher standard of living is the factor"" argument a tough sell to me.

Second, [there (mostly) isn't a fixed number of jobs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy).  It's true that a migrant coming in will supply an extra worker — let's say as a grocery store clerk.  That will tend to drive down the wages of grocery store clerks ever-so-slightly.  However, it will also produce demand for other workers.  The migrant is gonna go to the barber shop, and is gonna buy bread from the baker.  Their wages tend to be driven up on average, as there's more demand.

Individual people can still lose out — if a lot of workers with no skillset come in, it'll tend to push down wages of existing unskilled workers and up wages of skilled workers.  But it won't make the society across the board worse-off.

(Exception: in a primary sector industry, like oil extraction, mining, or agriculture, the scarcity of land may determine how manu workers are needed, and a worker immigrating doesn't produce more land.  However, in a developed economy, resource extraction is only a small part.)

&gt;Let us go a few generations with only a limited number of highly skilled immigrants and see what happens

I mean, it's not that I disagree with the concept, but that's what was already being tried.

&gt;Japan is almost there with having a larger retired population than working age.

Japan is [at a ratio of about 2.1 workers per retiree](http://www.econdataus.com/workers.html).  Current projections in the graph I linked are 1.55 in 2050, about two retirees to support per three workers.

&gt;They are also 3x as densely populated as California.  They can lose 80 million people and be fine.

It's not the population density that they're worried about — the same issues would apply if they suddenly had twice as much land.

&gt;Standard of living will go up as more houses become available and public transit is less crowded.

Well…it's true that house prices may well decline with a population decline.  But that also means a lot of people having their savings evaporate.

In the event of a decline, I doubt that you'd see radically-less-crowded public transit.  The government will spend however much the population requires and supports, and will amortize out the initial costs over thr lifetime of the transit.  If population declines, so will tax revenue, ans you'll have lines shut down or just not replace ones that become too old and are declared unsafe.

&gt;Buying power may go down as taxes to support the elderly eat up a higher portion of income, but that’s temporary.

It stays down until fertility rises back up (well, and for some time after that, for the effects to propagate to the workforce and retirees).  But, yeah, you *could* pull out of it eventually.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7megoe/macron_ramps_up_expulsions_id_checks_as_france/druewsh/,vokegaf,1514426420

Lastly, I'm a bit surprised that several people are wondering what the definition of harassment means here. If people are feeling in my about some part of their daily life, then shouldn't we try to discuss what that might be and how we can help rather than try to implicitly ask them to grow a thicker skin. I am a bit biased here, I'll admit, since I have friends who have been met that way and some who actively fear being alone at night outside. Like damn, if we are faced with such a cultural problem we have to discuss it seriously and what tools can be used to fix it. This is one case where the consequences of the actions, that people are feeling very uncomfortable, are what we should be discussing and seek to figure out how.

The annoying part about large issued is that to fix them is similar to steering a ship. A single entity can't by itself fix the situation, and thus you can't simply pass a law saying ""Don't harass people"". Instead it has to be a soft change through affecting several different parts of society to motivate them to act according to what we want to achieve. Which governmental tool that is best suited for this I do not know, and would have to hope academics can figure out in conjunction with governments. (For reference I am basing much here on the tool focused view of governing expunged by works such as ""Designing government"".)

Classmates have a bigger impact on assimilation than school staff. There will be no assimilation when nearly all the immigrants go to schools that are majority immigrant. The influence of parents also exceeds that of school.

2776,"I'm on my phone and can't go digging but opinion polls consistently put the British public as being more accepting of immigration from European countries, Eastern Europe included (albeit lower than Western Europe) with Africa/Middle East/South Asia vastly lower.

I don't know what answer you want or expect, but Brits are more open to European immigration than from just about anywhere else.

The backlash against Eastern European migration was enabled by failure of the government to properly manage numbers over a period of years. It's regrettable that Blair took such a laissez-faire approach, it has hurt a great deal of people, not least Eastern Europeans themselves who were vilified for coming in such high numbers over such a short period of time. It could've been people from anywhere, the raw numbers were simply too high for it not to cause backlash and discomfort.

Better management of immigration with a modicum of intelligence and the UK would probably be staying in the EU.

If the A8 started experiencing the levels of immigration that the UK did practically overnight from the 2004 ascensions I think they would at absolute best have had the same response.

2802,"MADRID — The Latest on the fallout from the independence movement in the Catalonia region of Spain (all times local):

4:35 p.m.

A mostly satirical campaign pushing for a sizeable chunk of Catalonia to declare its independence from the region but remain in Spain has become a social media success.

The internet campaign to establish the fictitious region of ""Tabarnia"" in the provinces of Barcelona and nearby Tarragona has drawn loads of comments following the divisive drive for independence led by the region's previous government.

Barcelona and nearby Tarragona are among the least pro-independence areas of Catalonia.

The mocking campaign uses slogans such as ""Freedom for Tabarnia"" and ""Catalonia robs Tabarnia,"" imitating the ones supporters of Catalan secession used to promote breaking away from Spain.

The campaign, run by a group called Barcelona Is Not Catalonia, was front-page news in many Spanish papers on Wednesday and a top trending topic Tuesday on Twitter.

___

10:50 a.m.
Spain's Interior Ministry says it is withdrawing thousands of police reinforcements who were deployed to its northeastern region of Catalonia in the run-up to an attempted referendum on the region's independence in October.


Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said late Tuesday the estimated 5,000 reinforcements are no longer necessary following the return to normalcy after Spain seized control of the restive region following a declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament weeks after the referendum.

Spain was criticized over police using force to try to prevent the referendum from taking place. Hundreds of people, including police, were reported injured.


Spain later dismissed the Catalan government, dissolved the regional parliament and ordered fresh elections for Dec. 21 to quell the secession push and restore legality.",,/r/europe/comments/7mi27g/the_latest_satirical_campaign_for_barcelona/dru2yt6/,Tabarnia,1514411368

If Poland can use the Euro with little problem, then it isn’t really an issue for the rest of the eurozone if they joined or not .It is also well known that Greece lied about its debt, before they joined the euro so it happened long before that. Larger economies such as Spain and Italy are less vulnerable to having such large debt. 

It is also accepted by most that Greece leaving the eurozone isn’t a good idea as any supposed minor benefits would be outweighed by the negatives of such. It took 7 years to establish the euro and countries are required to spend two years in the exchange rate mechanism, first so assuming it is even doable to leave the euro, it would take years for that to happen.

2906,"&gt; I'm just saying we're not legally obligated to. Unlike the EU, who has to pay Farage's pension. 

If you think the EU will pay for British MEPs pensions AND give you a FTA, you are just out of your mind. It's quite amazing really, Theresa May folded on everything since the beginning so far and yet here you are using the same arguments that had no grip then and are completly irrelevent now.

Theresa May already agreed to pay those pensions, they are part of the ""exit bill"" she agreed to pay after the UK is out of the EU.

&gt; I don't know why you expect Britons to suddenly care about bankers just to be in the EU. We've never cared for them. The decision wasn't about them.

Well that's a good news because losing the banking passport will be the cost of the Brexit for the UK really. Probably among other things but this will be the most obvious one and the only one decided by Brussels. That's pretty fair really. If I was a brexiter, I'd be pretty happy about it. If you voted leave, you're probably not working in a bank.

&gt; Our delusions of grandeur aren't delusions if they're true

But they're not. A lot of people, maybe even you, in your country thought the UK would make the EU bend to their wish and what we saw was quite the opposite, Theresa May panicking 2 days before the end of the ultimatum, struggling with the DUP to end up by agreeing to everything and sign the paper in Brussels.

If the end of Phase One satisfied you, you're going to love Phase Two. They already announced that if The British kept playing dumb&amp;dumber asking for the moon they will just present them with a paper to sign, take it or leave it and that's it.

The UK isn't ready to leave, it will sign anything to have that transition. Right now, you don't even have the proper [infrastructures](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7mgm88/port_of_rotterdam_reveals_scale_of_brexit/) to live as you do without the EU.

3046,"&gt; People have different capacities to learn languages, especially if they are older, this isn't breaking news.

Any sane person can learn the official language of the country they live in (and which is spoken by a majority of the population) in three decades. For older people, the language test is simplified (only oral part applies for them).

&gt; Estonia is actively discriminating status on ethnicity

There is no such thing. There is one different citizenship policy applied to people who lived here before Soviet occupation and another to Soviet migrants. 

If your ancestors had Estonian citizenship, so do you. That includes, for example, many ethnic Russians in today's Pskov oblast, in territories that were part of Estonia before WWII.

Just because vast majority of Soviet migrants were Russians doesn't make it an ethnic thing. We are not to blame that such horrible, extremely unbalanced demographic policies were applied by occupation regime. Ultimately, it's Moscow to blame for the mess.

&gt; The current regime is basically a guarantee that no one will ever feel fully Estonian, even if some do decide to learn the language. 

And why is that? Estonian citizens can't be discriminated based on ethnicity or native language. That doesn't mean it would never happen, but it's something unacceptable in the society.

I'm not naive to think there are or will be no problems with ethnic Russians of Estonian citizenship, but at the very least I can speak to them. I know they at least understand information in Estonian. They have bothered to learn my language to get my country's citizenship. It's this small net of security to accept these people as mine.

Not similar at all.....unless black people were the occupiers?

&gt; They're alienated even when they speak the language well

I thought your point was regarding citizenship. If they speak the language, gaining citizenship should be no problem and done.
Are you suggesting some sort of affirmative action? Give Russians special status and treatment? Sounds like aperfect way to make their feeling of alienation worse, because it'll have the opposite outcome and create more resentment.

&gt; Lithuania is their host

No, they are not. They are the country left with the problem of dealing with vestiges of an occupying power, and have gien them a road to integration requiring reasonable steps.

&gt; Doing nothing and expecting people to integarate never worked.

Are they not offering language and culture courses? I dont know the answer to this, but assumed it was provided by the sate.
If this isnt the case, I agree with you, and it should be provided.
If it is offered, then the next step is a small commitment to *try* to integrate. I understand the problem to be primarily people that dont/wont/cant learn the language, not people that do.

&gt; Who caares who's to blame?

Its not a question of blame, its a question of effort to integrate. You are simply asking that the state and native population continue to make exceptions for the leftover of an occupying power, and you expect nothing of them at all.

This is debatable. Lithuania chose another way and they are in NATO and EU now. They had 20% of minorities in 1991, quite a sufficient number.

(https://www.lawmix.ru/sssr/1924)[Treaty between Russia and Estonia] signed on 12th of January 1991. Couldn't find it in English but I'm sure you could find it in Estonian by date.

*The Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and the Republic of Estonia undertake mutual obligations to guarantee to the persons living at the time of signing this Treaty on the territories of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Republic of Estonia and now citizens of the USSR the right to retain or obtain the citizenship of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic or Estonian Republic in accordance with their free will.

Sacrifices you talk about?

For alot of countries 50%+ of gas comes from Russia. No gas means no power and in alot of homes no heating.

You can import trhough LNG terminal, but youll pay 3x the rate of Russia. Defacto making your power price 3x as high and you cook/heating price too.

It's ridiculous to even suggest these non solutions. Fossil fuels create or break a economy, to make them 3 times as expensive is a guaranteed recesion.

Sigh and where does that happen? Come on. Stop the ridiculous generalisation. You can even see it in this very same thread about a picture that aims to mock separatist that such a thing did not or barely happen.

&gt; I am stating the verifiable truth that a group of some Spaniards, but only Spaniards -in short, a group you can term ""Spaniards"", 

You do realize that if someone uses Spaniards they refer usually to all spaniards? Not ""that specific group of people that have the same nationality?"" If its another specific group then there is probably another reason that you want to call them out - other than their nationality. 

&gt; Here, for example, you have the OP of this very post purposefully lying about statistics and doing some the_donald-esque trolling to intellectually exhaust me. Read that thread and come back to tell me that I am being unfair.

No clue what he means about the 2014 referendum unless he says abstentions are votes against separation, which probably comes close to the truth. For the other part he is right isnt he. One can nitpick and say Podemos isnt specifically against separation, but even though they support a referendum and let people choose they never said they want independence - quite the contrary actually. So since they dont support separation, they are obviously against. 

And please: that comment section with you is highly polarized. Once again you trying to victimize ""catalans"" when obviously you just mean separatists. 

As I said: I dont deny that there is propaganda. However it is just fucking biased and stupid to only blame one side. Catalonia gets to stay in the EU, businesses wont leave, Catalonia is opressed, 900 victims of police brutality, Spain abuses power to move some art pieces. Most of that just recently but some are from years back.

I mean you want some blatant propaganda, as in pull numbers out of your ass:

You're the one that came with the nonsens of what Xavier Domenech said. That him saying ""I won't vote for a pro-independence government"" means ""all my voters are pro-union and against independence"".

And by the way, you're being untrue.

most deals have a dedicated court with seats of both sides. However, up until now, the EU does not want to do this even though it is what the EU does with other states such as Norway. (this might just be a stance for negotiation of course). I don't see the UK agreeing to ECJ in the sense that the UK would not have a seat in it.

&gt; WTO rules aren't even garantee then.

it would be very hard for the EU to impose a trade ban against the UK this would be seen as an act of war by the UN. 

Of course more important is the WTO does not cover services to the EU could ban all and any services from the UK in the EU. But doing so would be an act of bad blood since for basically all other nations the EU only restrict some services (finance for example).

3524,"Perhaps you're considering sculpture a bit too narrowly? Those Renaissance techniques were developed and done to death, until realistic figurative depiction itself becomes trite. Consider what photography did for realistic painting — why bother to paint realistically when you can take a photo? Mechanical reproduction and depiction changes the game. The most impressive thing about Michelangelo's David for its audience anyway wasn't its realism but the massive size (over 4 m tall), the composition, the choice to depict David pre-battle in a relaxed rather than triumphant pose, the political flattery of Florence, etc. These are things that would resonate very differently with a modern audience. 

Still, if you want realism, what about [hyperrealistic sculptures](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/duane-hanson-serpentine) like those of  Duane Hanson? 

My personal favourite modern figurative sculptors though have a more exaggerated style, like Fernando [Botero](https://www.artsy.net/artist/fernando-botero) or, more obscure, Peter Lenk. Like Michelangelo, there's a political story but its more a critique of power than fawning over some   patron (the Medicis). 

You probably wouldn't appreciate Richard Serra or Jeff Koons or Damian Ortega directly — they're not aethetically lush, but each inventive in a different way. Dare I even ask how you feel about Damian Hirst's famous *[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/global-culture/beginners-guide-contemporary-art1/v/hirst-s-shark-interpreting-contemporary-art)* which is a shark in a tank of formaldehyde?

https://youtu.be/puJ-arJgkZU

The interviewer simply ignores valid statements, if you don't come out of this being sympathetic to Spencer then you aren't honest with yourself.

Same can happen in Sweden, granted if the Swedish far right really are extreme and not for example just share the view of some average american conservative and should not be called that.

You can acknowledge when they are right, It's virtually impossible for any movement to get all the answers wrong just based on probability, but you really have to roast them on their wrongs, because when it comes to both far left and far right their wrongs end in planned genocides.

Just as the interviewer could make Spencer advocate for genocide pointing out it's the only way an american ethnostate can be founded, by simply following his logic to the end rather than rejecting some base harmless premise, I'm sure same can and should be done here before the people get even more sympathetic with them.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/7mdek0/swedish_opposition_to_the_far_right_talk_to_the/drt7eg4/,LoseStreak,1514362916

It happened in the 1970s. Switzerland had gone for 100 years without large predators and the soil and vegetation of the Jura was suffering from chamois overfeeding and overpopulation. Not to mention the risk of plagues developing among the chamois themselves and passing to livestock and people.

There had been some talk about bringing back wolves and the usual people (shepherds, hunters, etc) went nuts against the idea. They didn't even dare to suggest bears. Then the government decided to bring back the lynx, but to avoid opposition they kept it secret.

They released *one couple.* Within *two years*, the locals noticed that the chamois didn't behave as confident and sedentary, and that the herds moved more instead of staying in the same places. As a result, the vegetation recovered and the soil erosion was halted.

3728,"&gt; Kashmir was invaded the same day both the countries Independence

It was actually the 22nd of October 1947, independence was 14th of August 1947, it happened after Sialkot and Gujranwala saw a large influx of ethnic Gurjars (Muslims) and Muslim Jats after the Dorga Raj's army targeted them for being Muslim and forced them out of their home land in Jammu and these men then went on to tell what happened which understandably enraged every in Pakistan. Also there was the Gilgit Rebellion. 

Already I can tell you know nothing about this topic apart from what you've learned to parrot from comments on /r/worldnews. 

&gt;Pakistan invaders Kalat and Baluchistan 

Baluchistan was never invaded, the Nawab of Las Bela in the south willingly ceded to Pakistan without any need of invasion, Gwadar was still a part of Oman then it happened been purchased and the northern ethnic Pashtun and Hazara region (where 35-45% of the population lives) was and still is pro-Pakistan who wanted to be a part of Pakistan since the beginning, it was the Kalat region that was invaded in 1948 (which I've already brought up). 

&gt;They even did nazi genocide on Bangladesh  

The numbers were terribly inflated by both Indians and Bangladeshis, how could 90,000 troops of which 56,000 are combat troops out on patrol rape, murder and kill 3 million in less than a month? Like how? The attacks on the Muslim Bengalis aren't seen as genocide by any scholar. However attacks on Hindu Bengalis by the Pakistani state were wrong and I condemn those actions, I also condemn the attacks against the Urdu-speaking pro-Pakistan Biharis by the Bangladeshis which killed up to 1/5th of all of them, that can be seen as a ""Nazi genocide"". 

&gt;But yeah for you being Muslim all you care how Kaffirs are destroying your land . Lol 

Um no, when have I mentioned anything like that, you're comment gets more and more absurd the more I go through it. 

&gt;FYI . Brits wiped out most natives from Australia to America's and replaced with white people I guess you don't study that because it hurts your pride 

As far as I'm concerned the British were limited to North America and the Carribean and they too did less killings than the Americans. The Spanish, French, Dutch and Portugese did most of the killing there.

3751,"Indian society don't upset me. It is the sheer chaos and non-coherence of its system of government that tells me that they would not overtake the East Asian region. 

Lest you think that I am thinking that the typical Indian is inferior to East Asians, I will let you know that I think person to person, that an Indian is at least as smart as a East Asian, if not more. 

The problem I see with India is that it is a society divided on itself. The various ethnic groups are at odds with each other, state versus state, region versus region, religion versus religion and then within the Hindu religion you still have the issue of caste versus caste, regardless of affirmative action by the government there. 

Contrast that with China for instance, a overwhelming Han ethnic group that dominates everything with a somewhat common history, sharing roughly similar culture and language, and more importantly, with a long, long history of a strong central governmental control. 

My point is, India is too fractured internally, too chaotic to be a challenger to China, who had a longer history of being unified and being coherent nationally. 

Look at history. India had no major wars and internal strife at the level of what China had post WW2. 

India may hae suffered through partition and tensions with Pakistan, racial and religious riots after the British left, but China suffered through a deadly civil war that killed millions on top of the of almost 20 years of Japanese invasion, then fought the Americans that nearly crippled their economy in Korea, then suffered through Mao's madness and misrule not once, but twice, finally regained its sanity only at the end of the 70s, yet, here we are, China economic strength is twice the size of Indias, despite India having relative stability far longer that China ever been.

By rights, India and China should have swapped places. Things should be ""Made in India"" not ""Made in China"", but yet, here we are.

How do you explain that?

TL:DR

Putin may not get enough turnout for the election, if the supporters of Navalny will boycott the elections. 

&lt;hr&gt;

The problem is, that in the last elections he received 45 million votes ([45,602,075](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_presidential_election,_2012) on Rus wiki and 46 on Eng wiki ). This is less than a third of the total population of the country. It turns out that 100 million either did not go to the election, or voted against him.

So, not that he was worried about turnout, counting votes or anything else like that.

&gt; Catalonia is a well to do hub

Youre misunderstanding what a hinterland is. It refers to the area surrounding an urban centre that forms the agricultural/industrial catchment area, while the hub/urban area (better put) provides administrative services to the wider hinterland. The concept doesnt scale up indefinitely as you implied (i.e. Eastern Europe is Western Europes hinterland because the West is richer) because of the basic reality of economic transactions across the areas. This is a basic concept in geograohy and economics.

Tradeable good are things like smartphones, oil, gasoline, automobiles, refrigerators, computers, airplanes, commodities - basically, anything that can be sold in a non-local market.

Unlike PiS, PO did not hastily change the TV and civil service laws in order to sweep out every last executive with opposite political views. PiS appointed a hardcore party propagandist to be the Public TV director -- a guy who once said he wanted to be ""Kaczynski's bull terrier"" and was responsible for the dirtiest campaign smear jobs (the famous ""Wehrmacht grampa"" of Donald Tusk).

You know why PO didn't do any of those things? Because they saw Poland as part of the civilized world, where some standards are observed (even if they can be stretched here and there).

3953,"&gt; Uh. Wrong. There is no justification ever for genocide, including the irrational rhetoric of ""self-defence"" applied to genocide - which is a common denial rhetoric in all genocides. This is not only common sense, but it is established in case law.

Holy shit projection. I never said the armenian genocide was at any point self defense. I never said genocide anywhere, 

Let me explain something to you. I am not a strawman, I understand that this was not the clearest thing but you should have asked for clarification as opposed to assuming I was justifying the genocide. 

&gt; First of all, the motives or motivations have no relevance on the fact that a genocide was committed.

No, but it is important to include in historical texts that talk about the motivation for the genocide, which HAS ALWAYS been my point. 

&gt; Second of all, if anything the ideology of the times

What ideology, the three pashas were dictators

&gt; along with the alliance with Kaiser Germany was the main motivator as in providing a solution, or the only solution, to the pesky problem of having several incompatible nations within your borders threatening the plans for your future nation-state. 

Ok, explanation here, what the fuck are you talking about? How the hell did the German alliance cause genocide? The Namibian genocide was not a blueprint for the armenian genocide. 

&gt; But obviously a narrative based on victim-hood which helps justify the unjustifiable is preferred.

Hey look strawmen. 

&gt; Which is nothing as far as I am aware. He didn't fix anything related to Armenia, the nation, the region, the history, the heritage, ... nothing.

getting Armenians elected to the turkish parliament and preventing massacres against minorities is a pretty big fucking deal. Also ataturk given the text of the Treaty of Lausanne could have easily only given minority rights to the greeks, but he included the Armenians. Fucking racist bastard am I right? 

&gt; The point I am trying to make is that there is a difference between being against a nation (in the form of a state, a region, autonomous self-rule, whatever) and members of said nation. Ataturk may not have been against Armenians but he definitely was against any manifestation of the term Armenia within the borders he controlled. I really don't know how else to explain this.

Ok, so like literally any other leader at the time. Or were the Armenians allowing expression of Azerbaijani culture. Find me a single fucking leader at the time that promoted minority culture. He was against independence, but allowed Armenians to do what they wanted. 

&gt; Also revisit the Spanish civil war, even though obviously it wasn't an ethnic war, arguably the Catalans were mostly on one side but there were others were with the fascists. Franco's regime was decidedly against such a thing as the Catalan nation, there is no dispute there, and yet there were tons of Catalans in his ranks. You'll find the same in other regimes throughout history. That doesn't imply anything.

If I said that the Armenian genocide was a civil war you would be trying to string me up right now. The Armenian genocide was not a civil war. It was an interstate war. Also that is straight up wrong about the catalans in the Francoist government, there were none of note. You are distorting facts about both events in a way that is flat out one. Also securing the election of one of the most hated minorities as well as several other non muslims where there would not be none until really this past election cycle is fucking notable. 

&gt; If there had been a genocide committed, yes, but that's not the case. But what did occur was ethnic cleansing - where all Azeris were sent to Azerbaijan (and all Armenians were sent from Azerbaijan to Armenia).

So could the first Ottoman committed stage be genocide, and the second ethnic cleansing? Or does somehow ethnic cleansing become genocide because there was a genocide in the past?

&gt; Ataturk was the head of state who founded the modern state of Turkey on the foundations which CUP laid out and furthered the nation-state formation at the expense of the other nations which were destroyed as such

The foundations laid out by the three pashas, not the CUP for one, and the three pashas were pan turkic in ideology, so there are clear differences

&gt; - this is furthering the CUP's plans, not undoing it, independently of whatever he said about the CUP. 

The CUP wanted to create a muslim state and transitioned to pan turkicsm when that failed. This is different from Ataturk which was a turkish nationalist. 

&gt; Again did he, as the head of state, do anything to fix the Armenian nation

He did nothing, like absolutely nothing

&gt; did he work to annihilate whatever remained of the Armenian nation within the borders of the state he controlled?

He did not cover up Armenian history, most of the geographical name changes took place after word. He simply ignored it. That is actively different from suppressing what happened. This was the state ideology after he died. While there are instances of them suppressing information, they did not deny it happened altogether. This took place after Ataturk died, when the numbers began to drop and the destruction of Armenian churches began to take place.

&gt;No, you are talking about Ataturk, then you are switching to another damn topic.

Huh? The whole topic is about Ataturk's role in the destruction of the Armenian nation as such, of Armenia. What change of topic? 

&gt; Do you or do you not believe that Ataturk was a moderating force for the Turkish Republic with its policy towards Armenians?

Towards *Armenia*? Absolutely Not! Do you know of anyone claiming that he was in favour of any manifestation of an Armenian nation within the borders he controlled?

Again, genocide is about the *destruction of a nation as that nation*. Genocide is NOT about the killing members of said nation! Did he promote the further destruction of that nation, as that nation, yes or no? or did he help undo the deptruciont of that nation, as that nation?

&gt; The Turkish state committed the destruction of the Armenian people, but ataturk helped moderate said policy.

He let Armenians live in those places always under a specific % proportion (3% and in best cases 5% was it?) so as they can never be majority again in the future? Is that what you mean by moderation?

One of the important components of the Lausanne treaty was that the Christians should be given equal rights and left alone. Oh he did that, but under specific conditions some of which I explained above. The intent was for the destroyed Armenia to never be Armenia ever again and for it to disappear, and it did. You are claiming Ataturk had nothing to do with this and yet all evidence points to you not being correct about this.

&gt;&gt; History speaks for itself: Armenia of 1915 is devoid of any Armenians today.

&gt; I'm sorry but where is this Armenia?

Check every single map produced of the region prior to 1915. Check every single news article until around early 20 century. People at the time knew where was Armenia and yet you are questioning ""where is this Armenia"" - this is exactly what Ataturk help to accomplish. Erase the name of a country (in its lose sense of the word) from the geography and attempted to erase it from the pages of history as well.

&gt; Yes, the community was vastly decreased as the result of genocide, but there still remains a small community. The fact that you are willing to ignore that just to prove your point is frustrating.

Of how many? How open they are about being Armenians? How many turned or pretended to be Muslim in order to survive AFTER 1923 and still kept their identity as Muslims during Ataturk's rule and the rule of the posterior regimes up until today? Do you even know? 

But that is not even the point the point is that a **nation** was destroyed, as such, there is no such thing as an Armenian nation or Armenia in what is today Eastern Turkey. This is what genocide is: The intent to destroy a nation as such. The non-legal understanding of it goes beyond the mere acts of killing defined in genocide law.

&gt; Do you or do you not think he was an absolute monarch with absolute control over all things that happened in Turkey?

He was he head of state of Turkey. Again, you are confusing Ataturk the person with Ataturk the statesman. Unless and until you do not separate these two things and thus seperate whatever attaches you emotionally to him from an objective view of his *[stated intentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutuk)*, *policies*, and *acts*, you will be unable to have an objective historic view of the era and the region.

&gt; He ignored it beyond that because all it would do is weaken his rule.

He did more than that, but in any case, this is the problem, you are justifying all and every single thing. When there is denial of history, cognitive dissonance and outright distorted revisionism, then it shouldn't matter WHY he did what he did. What matters is that he did it. It doesn't matter why Armenia was erased from history. What matters is that it was erased. It doesn't matter why the genocide was committed, what matters is that it was committed. Facts which are usually denied by many. Excuses upon excuses combined with a cult of personality formed in harmony with a nationalist ideology in order to form a cohesive and strong state to face the challenges of what would come during the 20th century, is not an objective view of history. It is a distorted *old* view still anchored in all the machinations which went into play to create this machine to stop the reds and bring order in the world. 

&gt; Essentially, was he interested in giving that land over to the USSR? No, he was not. He put no emphasis on it because there was an existential threat if he did. His policy was that the Armenians shouldnt have rebelled, but that the massacre of Armenians was not ok. 

Well I didn't even mention *how* any alternative could be, and that is beyond this discussion anyway, but yes an independent Armenia risked falling under the future USSR. Even Turkey under Ataturk did.

But you see, you are again justifying his stated intentions, acts and policies as a statesman. The point is that he justified the further destruction and erasure of Armenia. Something which is still denied even today, long after the USSR has collapsed. The reasons for why, are not even relevant when the discussion is about the denial of his intentions as a statesman and his policies and acts to this end.

The very fact that he attributes to ""claiming the oldest historical rights"" speaks volumes. It was the right of self determination of nations to free themselves from imperialism, something which is absolutely non-controversial in today's view of history all over the world and yet it is STILL unspeakable in 2017 when it relates to Turkey. Look at this thread as one evidence.

Because they are granted that right by treaty and EU law prevents such rights from being revoked? 

Greece should allow actual community consultation after it revokes sharia law like it plans to do because there is no need to do so. Different religions are different. Should Turkey appoint the head of the Greek orthodox church because that is the standard for imams? Only fair right?

&gt; The average Greek has to abide by civil code, not sharia law. Why should a Muslim be exempt from laws?

A Muslim is not exempt for this, this has never been the case. The fact is they have problems because the greek state specifically and deliberately under funds the schools.

Ok, so the Turks now have the right to appoint whoever they want as the head of the greek church right? I mean that is an exemption? Or is that also stupid

&gt; No religion should have any privilege over any other religion. 

Then change your constitution, because your constitution does privilege it. 

&gt; Greece is a Greek ethnostate and should enforce laws with that presumption.

OK, then you will have to give western thrace back to turkey because you gave the minority such rights and you cannot revoke them according to EU law.

You are claiming that Ataturk was a big fan and planner of the genocide. When at this point Ataturk had cut his ties with the CUP. 

&gt; Maybe you are the one who should stop defending the indefensible and come up with a narrative which is helpful instead of beating a dead horse which is this cult of personality which should've been long dead like the majority of dictators of the 20th century.

Ataturk was far from perfect. But there is CLEAR fucking evidence he steered the country away from some of its more anti Armenian tenancies. 

&gt; That's now how state responsibility works. Again no one is judging his person and no one cares about that but those who worship him. He took the helms of a state which had committed a genocide, and he contributed to further the annihilation of a nation within the borders of the state he was in charge of. Period.

Right, but he worked to steer the rabid anti Armenian sentiments from being put into state law. The fact is, he did a lot to hold back on anti Armenian policies. If you say that, you need to add the context that he was a moderator. I mean according to your own logic the moral thing was not becoming leader and let a second Armenian genocide happen. Saying that he was deliberately trying to cover it up when the evidence is mixed at best is fucking stupid. 

&gt; Yes, he was dead in 1934!

Was that part of the systematic renaming campaign? And again, Ataturk was not a god, there is no way he could have stopped that film from facing pressure from the government.

Archaeological digs taking place right now is questioning everything we think we know. The elaborate constructions found indicates that Denmark as a unified centrally controlled kingdom is older than previously assumed. 

When I was a kid the usual theory said Denmark became a nation in the 10th century https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelling_stones because that is what they said the writings on the stones mean.

Then they found older structures that could not have been build without some kind of strong leadership which added a few centuries more.

Now they say Denmark was already a defined nation around 500 which controlled and protected its borders. 

Bottom line is we do not really know what Denmark means, but I lean towards the theory that the people living in this area did not invent the name. Just like the word Viking was something people in other areas called them.

4072,"It is a very catch 22 kind of situation.

In that moment of time USSR used shady methods to basically dismantle/destabilize regions. A 'good' example is the Prussian lands, now Kaliningrad where the local population was deported and Soviet people were imported.

This was done by Stalin, who used people as chess pieces. Ironically in doing so he managed to industrialize USSR in such haste that this production arguably won USSR the war, by collectivizing and forcefully moving people into towns or factory areas.

Another catch 22 is Stalin itself, he used such dictatorial methods that some still praise him for it while others affected curse him.

Ah yes, the same fate was to be for Estonia, Latvia. Finnish occupied areas they didn't really have to do anything as during the war most people had escaped already those land areas and those few who did resettled where already of USSR population.

Wind the events forward to ~1988-1992 and you have a huge demographic crisis. USSR as a state fell, occupied areas get their statehood back. Estonia was left with a ~30% 'minority', basically the country was demographically butchered.

Now the question was what to do now? Give everyone citizenship and face a probable unstable country due to a very hostile opposition between population groups? More or less declare the 1920's -1930's Estonia dead? Try to build a somekind of Israel type nation of two ex-combatant people living under one roof?

Well Estonians and by their extension Estonian politicians figured Estonia as land piece that compared to the other successor state Russia was a very minor spot on the map and that they should continue the nation as it was during the first independence time so bloodlines and documents were gathered to trace back who should get citizenship.

The middle way was decided to allow USSR citizens to apply for citizenship through a test, others got grey passports (that still had most of the privileges besides a few like voting in primary elections). This again was to avoid a politically unstable environment, other idea was that at that time it was very uncertain what Russia would do, just months ago there were APC's and tanks on other occupied territories quelling revolutions, so giving the same USSR minded people a part on deciding would be dangerous as at that time it could be seen as a ""cold civil war"" for a brief moment.

Mind you these USSR minded people who moved in Estonian during these years didn't like it either, they just lost their own nation and somewhat accustomed reason of being ""top dog"". Now the occupied nation got free and the locals were ""top dog"". This practically cause USSR minded to more or less at one point assault/riot in the parliament building by storming the gates. Estonian minded people in turn came to the defense of the , now Estonian minded parliament.

So what I am trying to say from the eyes of Estonians this was basically a question of trying to come back from quarter-genocide or Russification. Yes people suffered, USSR minded and Estonians but as a Estonian I see no other way. When USSR plays ball and throws you against the mud, if you have a chance you try to come back as soft as possible but if a few eggs need to be cracked there is no other way. We once were ""neutral"", this was at the start of WW2, we ended up with USSR bases, Communists calling locals to ""hand in your weapons"" and our nation lost.

To counter it I think we are handling it a little bit better than USSR did, we aren't deporting or killing ex-USSR citizens. While there is a huge cultural gap still in our nation with each year there are a little bit more and more Estonian passport holders and Estonian speakers. Europe has more or less seen how 'well' integration works, we are somewhat managing to at least move it in some way.

You are trying to view this from a blank slate but the problem has a history behind it. There are already chapters written so simply calling someone ""far right"" is bold.

Turks are a Turkic people originally from Central Asia who speak a Turkic language. Genetically they are related to Kurds as well as those from the Caucasus (like Armenia).

It'd be weird if kids in Catalonia were taught in Spanish wouldn't it? Like some kind of imposition or something. That'd be a politically motivated policy in your eyes right?

So Catalonia is a country now? 

However Lets take France as example: In no schools you see french kids being taught Occitan or gallo or provencal or even catalan. That the regional language gets teached in schools is the exception in Spain - its not the norm for everywhere else.

&gt; This is not a real argument and you know it.

Nor is calling the ""anti-catalan by definition"". It is just a stupid accusation that is far from the truth. Any unbiased person or even any person with respect for other peoples view can see that. You choose what kind of person you want to be. 

&gt; Well I don't know about galician but I'm attending university in Catalan, English and Spanish without an issue so...? 

cool! Look if you want that, thats absolutely fine. If my kid wants to learn galician at an academic level - fine by me! But teaching it in an *obligatory* school even though the educational purpose is questionable at best is outdated. The more languages you speak the better - that goes for catalan or any other language. However the reality is also that 50% of catalans dont speak catalana - not even at home, let alone at work. This is one of the cases where politics is happening without connection to the population. 

&gt; hmmmmm, then maybe you shouldn't use the same argumentation as them if you're so against the regime. 

Just sad man. So disrespectful. 

&gt; I do remember taking a Spanish exam for that. Oh well anyway, here's Selectividad

Isnt that done regionally? Which means the regions get to decide what kind of test is done and what standards should be applied?

&gt; Neither. A certain sector of C's hierarchy is though, and they share their ideals. Not that they're unique to francoism though, Spanish imperialism has been alive for centuries.

And how much? Why dont you just give clear answers? I asked you if a substantial amount of ciudadanos are francoists in your eyes and if those francoists are a political force to be reckoned with.

&gt; You do share some of their points, so you should try to examine that yourself. It's bad to deny diversity in your country you know?

Its not denied. What is bad is to enforce diversity. Let people do what they want. Offer what reality demands. More than half who are in catalan schools wont use catalan anyway, and of those who use it: they wont use it at a level that requires them to visit any academic course.

4122,"&gt; And here's another one: funding for the UNHCR:

But UNHCR is a part of the UN, so that's not really what I talked about when I said that it doesn't cover non-UN related projects.

Also, that statistics is just not reliable, because it compares contributions made till October, which ignores that some countries might have contributed all they wanted to already, while others might have contributed later on in the year. You should only compare contributions for the whole year.

Also I don't know why you keep bringing up V4 or EE, I thought we were talking about Austria. But fine, if we are talking about V4 - I think no one can deny that we do not contribute financially as much as Germany (not even when we count it proportionally given the size of our economies), but you also need to realize that we're not the target countries of refugees and thus it's just not as necessary for us to care about this issue and also our populations are more hostile to the idea of us spending money in the Middle East, so politicians reflect that.

But you know what - I actually think that if we're talking just about real refugees (those who are driven out of their homes because of war) and not economic migrants, medical and military missions and political actions aiming at stopping the violence are actually more important than how much money you throw on the UNHCR.

Because you can as well throw billions on the UNHCR, but if you don't ensure that people can eventually go back to their countries, the people will eventually not be ok with sitting in a refugee camp indefinitely anyway, no matter how satisfying the camp is.

And in this sense, given the economic, diplomatic and military strength of my country, I'm actually not ashamed of my country's contribution to improve the situation in Iraq and Syria. We've been supplying the Kurds against ISIS when they urgently needed it, before other European countries stepped in, we've been the only EU country to maintain functional embassy in Syria and used that to distribute humanitarian help and we've been sending military medics to Iraq to help the Iraqi forces in their counter-ISIS offensive + we train their air force.

We may not spend as much as you do, but our foreign policy in the Middle East is not bad at all.

It's not like we have some legal obligation to pay anything. We're still nowhere near to your economic development and nowhere near to your level of budget surpluses, so we have many more important things to spend on. Of course if we knew that we were the ones to be flooded with refugees/migrants we would be spending more.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7m8bsa/help_refugees_wherever_they_come_from_austrias/drsdrqr/,kristynaZ,1514318189

4124,"&gt;I do not contest that it is better and more effective to help in the region. Which is why my country is doing exactly that. However, the V4 are criticizing germany for what it is doing, so we can criticise them for what they are not doing.

Their policies or lack of have no real impact on Germany, whereas policies of Germany have impact on all EU, as does Sweden's, they're not coming here for nothing by the millions, and majority of them are economic migrants, which you should best remember

&gt;The notion that Germany and Sweden want as many refugees as possible is plainly wrong. The refugees are also not ""ruining my country"". And no, it apparently isn't ""all on us"" because some people in third countries cannot shut up about Germany and its refugees. This includes you. Apparently people, and you, care.

Of course I care, because your policies have direct impact on my future and well being, if you can't sustain your policies then why continue them all the while demanding others should practice those unsustainable policies as well? And yes, Sweden and Germany do appear as they'd want as many Arabs and Africans as possible, any ""sensible"" talk was for years, decades demonized, and how it's turning out? Not to mention there's not a single real action taken from either of you, it's all empty talk before elections as in Sweden's case or simply pretending that somehow in 20 or 40 years things get better while continuing doing the same. Whether you, or I think they're ruining your country, or any country is up to the beholder but they're most certainly making your life, or your country better, that much I can objectively say. If your tax payers do not increase in volume all the while people that do enjoy the tax benefits then you'll see decrease either in quantity or quality of the tax services, and that's just one downside. 

&gt;When a country has a zillion islands like Greece does, it isn't that easy. Also, the problem is more of legal nature. People that float around in the mediterranean on their way towards lampedusa can and shouldn't be left to drown (this would also violate international maritime law) and we cannot simply tow their ships back to Libya either (due to the territorial integrity of a souvereign country).

I do agree, that countries such as Greece should pose challenge, but however not something impossible or even hard as per alternatives. You only need to concentrate your maritime supervision in those areas, sink any boat that comes while shipping those people either to back to the country they came from or to African country EU would bribe to accept them, this would undoubtedly cull most of the traffic. Also you should really, really see where the pickups have happened, they're literally from the coast of Libya past two years by NGO groups, and I don't think preventing all that would pose challenge when you start confiscating the ships that are capable of carrying heavy cargo and making that trip (Which is by the hundreds of kilometers with cargo that's in the tens of thousands of kilos, so ""rubber boats"" aren't the ones making the trips. 

&gt;Any stats that ""most of the arrivals"" happened through NGOs?

Which ones you want? The ones that 

Here's from North African pick ups, estimate made by Frontex chairman in a interview made by the Guardian, putting the number at 40% 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/27/ngo-rescues-off-libya-encourage-traffickers-eu-borders-chief

Depending on the year and from whom you ask the numbers I've seen vary from 40% to 70%, but regardless 40% is thus far the smallest number I've seen and that's massive number for NGO's, and you have to remember that we can monitor the routes these ships take, and they're taking route that's going literally at the coast of Libya, just barely enough to warrant international waters.

&gt;I agree with monitoring the NGOs, but that isn't the solution for the streams of people. The people were coming before the first NGOs started showing up in the mediterranean and they will continue to do so after the NGOs are gone.

The millions of MENA migrants EU have mostly arrived by different humanitarian programs, you have to remember that vast majority of these people will never return to their own country, and I have yet to see study or data that would suggest that they'd actually carry their own weight in our system, and as such the weight is cumulative from them, it's simply unsustainable. If we're talking about ""integration"" period of 20 or even 40 years, or even longer then it becomes even more so, but I think it's fair to assume we both know that majority of these people will never carry their own weight, not even after 40 years, and I have little confidence in what I've seen that would change with later generations, few studies and articles I've read from Germany and Denmark and Finland would imply the situation even getting worse, if that's possible.

But regardless of all that, the number of arriving people, through programs or by on their own means is increasing and there's little will or action against that, so I do agree with your sentiment - they'll continue to arrive as long we do nothing significant to prevent that.

&gt;Not really true. Afghanistan accepts people back. Iraq and Syria are still no viable deportation destinations due to the war. Northern africa is a special case, however the share of northern africans amongst all arrivals is rather low. The majority of refugees from Africa doesn't come from the north. And I can perfectly relate to northern african countries not wanting to become deportation hubs for people of third countries. Unlike europe, these countries do not have a functioning welfare state and therefore, people are more likely to turn to crime in case of unemployment or legal limbo.

But Afghanistan is not a MENA country, is it now? It's in South-Asia, and even Afghanistan doesn't take theirs back from every EU country.

Iraq should have no problems taking their own back, most of Iraq wasn't affected by ISIS and today ISIS is officially beaten

I can't really say much for Syria so it's rather difficult to say anything concrete on them, I've read few reports about conflict areas roughly month ago, and that information would indicate there's nothing really keeping them going back.

About the share of Northern African arrivals in 2017, it's hard to say since I haven't read much about that, besides the arrivals from North Africa, which aren't that low.

But in the case of deportation hubs, I do agree, no one wants that, no one wants people that aren't capable of willing to work their own share in system that rewards you to not do anything, but the thing is, our welfare states are not perpetual and the policies we practice today make it impossible to keep those welfare states running. I have hard time imaging for example Sweden having the same kind of welfare state 20 years from now on, as they do have today. Same goes to Finland as well, we have what we have today all due to the policies made 20 or even 30 years ago and we can put out estimates how much of a contribution each person makes quite early, since we've got decades of data from all that already. It's really optimistic to think you could make sharp turns to that, especially since we do already know how they behave in smaller quantities in those countries, I have little to convince me that the situation would turn brighter with larger quantities of ""bad immigrants"".

&gt;Watching the numbers in the context of decades doesn't make sense. We need to look at recent developments and there is a clear trend - downwards. 2015 will not be repeated and mediterranean arrivals in 2017 have been significantly lower than in 2016 (minus 50%). There is no indication that this trend will change in 2018.

Why you wouldn't think having broader picture wouldn't make the most sense? Even if we forego the year 2015 and assume it had the average amount of arrivals, you'd still see increase in the trend, hell even without year 2015 you'd still see increase in this decade to the previous one. Of course there's trend from having millions of arrivals from 2015, that's how spikes work, but you still have rather large increase in the volume of arriving people, with or without the year 2015 as per decade.

&gt;Not really, no. The numbers are declining.

From the year 2015, but not per decade they're not. Or you're free to link me to your source of information that shows the number of arriving people (We can for conveniences sake forego family reunification if you like) or I can simply dig it up, it's not that long ago I actually checked it myself, hell I'll make you graph about it if you like

&gt;You are obviously not talking about legal migration. We will see about that. The current main source of new arrivals is the mediterranean, and the total number for 2017 should be around 160k. Will take a while to get to ""many millions"" with these numbers.

Per decade you're still talking about millions, and that number is cumulative, and you forget the birth rates and family reunification programs as well

And yes, in the year 2015 there was massive spike in MENA immigration, but with or without the year 2015 you'd still have increase in the number of MENA migrants

I don't really know why you are debating this, it's not like it's not public information, you, me , we both can simply google it up if you don't believe me

Apples and oranges. You can criticize them without declaring dead people who cannot defend themselves as traitors. Shameful. 

&gt;Disregarding the parliament's decision and forcing the country into war without unanimous support is treason. 

Atatürk rebelled against the the government of his time. If he had failed and end result became worse, would he also be traitor despite spending his whole life for his people? By your logic, yes. I understand that you dislike Enver but you are lowering the importance of being a traitor. 

&gt;It was completely intentional and basically the worst action possible Ottoman empire at it's current state.

Not really. Britain, France and Russia had an agreement to split Ottoman Empire anyway. Had we not entered the war and Russia didn't have revolution, we would be a rump state today. And afaik Ottoman Empire tried to join on the side out past ""allies"" (Britain &amp; France) but found them not open to it. We literally had no other way of saving ourselves than joining and somehow winning. Enver's fault was not entering the war but thing he did (or failed to do) afterwards. Maybe not doing anything was the best choice but it is only so because we know the Russia had revolution. You are rewriting history to simply attack this man whose only actual redeeming quality was not being a traitor.

4199,"&gt;The removal of military force from the political toolbox is seen as a core characteristic of the post-war german state and

This portrays it as a matter of pure ideology.  I have a certain amount of skepticism here.  To me, maintaining a military looks like something that costs money and perhaps blood.  No country would like to do so if she could get away with not doing so.  And so there is a great incentive to free-ride common to all countries, people, and political units.

To me, that seems like a much more-likely driving motivation.

&gt;especially not just to play poodle to foreign interests in dustbowls far away…and german politicians often don't have the common sense to say no when such an OP doesn't touch our national interests.

That seems like an issue other than ""Germany should not have a military"" and more ""stronger assurances in the German political system that the person responsible for the decisions about the use of the military will not fail to follow German concerns"".

&gt;The Eastern NATO members need such guarantees from states who play in Russia's league - the nuclear powers. Germany is not in the same league and will never be

No single US state is in the same league as Russia either.  But if, say, Delaware declined to contribute people and tax dollars to a conflict because she, in isolation, is smaller than Russia, that would hardly carry much water.  It's the aggregate that has effect.

It's true that some countries can basically offload military costs onto other states because their military interests are sufficiently-aligned and it isn't worth the effort of the other state to get anyone else to chip in.  If the US vanished tomorrow, Canada would no doubt need to increase her military budget.

But Germany is a substantial chunk of Europe's economy and population.  Germany sitting out isn't the same as Luxembourg doing so.  It's enough to make a significant dent, and it create a very poor incentive for every other state, who says ""well, if wealthy and large Germany cannot even be bothered to keep a military viable, then why should I?""

&gt;Pardon my french but that's just not true, is it? France has always wanted to harness other states military resouces for its post-colonial foreign policy in Africa, only that they never had any real success in doing so whatsoever

At some point, Germany is going to have to deal with that if the EU has a military.  It will also, of course, have input on what the Franco-German-whoever-else military does.  But in no country in the world is there a military where individual parts can choose to sit various wars out.  So unless Germany will seek to block all French military xonxerns, which I think is probably unrealistic…

4208,"&gt;In its insouciance toward its security commitments, Germany is hardly more reliable than Trump, who frequently undermined NATO’s mutual defense clause before explicitly endorsing it in his speech at Warsaw. And Germany’s strategic confusion and lack of moral clarity transcends the current occupant of the White House; by 28 percent to 25 percent Germans prefer Russia as a partner to the United States, the country that liberated them from themselves and provided the conditions for their post-war economic boom and political stability.


Maybe the author could look inward and ask themselves for a minute whether the American behaviour, ranging from the Iraq war, for which we and France were basically branded as 'enemy sympathizers' by Bush, to the NSA scandal (sensitive issue in Germany) and now Trump are the result of this? Is Germany responsible for the fact that the United States has ruined its reputation on the continent? 

For the author 'moral clarity' is synonymous with US allegiance, even the historical analogy to the liberation of Germany is interesting, because well.. The Russians were involved too. With a loss of live that was quite dramatic. 

The author is still viewing this whole issue through the lens of the United States. But what if the opposite is actually the case? That positive relationships with Russia are genuinely helpful and a requirement for security, that the United States power is diminishing on the world-stage and concentrating on the Asian continent?

4239,"R/k selection is a hypothesis in Biology that is being incorporated into broader interdisciplinary thinking about biology, ecology and the social world. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory

Some animals have a handful of offspring and some have millions. K selected species invest in promoting education/welfare of their small number of offspring. r selected species merely jettison vast clouds of sperm/eggs in the hopes some of them survival probabilistically.

So obviously all human species are K selected at some level, however we still see a very wide range of behaviour within that range. The tribe called the Ik barely look after children at all, while in the West we invest considerable resources.

http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/country-matters-let-us-never-go-the-way-of-the-ik-1384655.html

Back to your question.

So we see items in the Muslim world such as the veiling of women. This to most Westerners reads as cultural specific practice but to some scientists it says 'r selection', something from biology because polygamist practices seem to follow along as a barely disguised biological survival strategy. Many young Muslim males probably have no prospects at all of obtaining a mate. Attacks on unveiled women are seen by their society as to be expected. 

Meanwhile on the other extreme in the West, availability of sex at least appears to be ubiquitous (it is not, this is signaling) while there has been a dramatic decline in the number of offspring being produced, and increasingly obsessive concern over the well being of children such as helicopter parenting is well documented, every child must go to university, sexual harassment is unacceptable under any circumstances #metoo.

I don't have all the answers but it seems to me if you accept there exists a basic biological difference between Europeans and Middle East/Africa then a lot of things abruptly seem to be explained. We behave differently because we are different.

tldr; Maybe Muslims and Westerners are different because they have two different reproductive strategies. Many cultural artifacts can then be explained as side affects of this.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/7m0ms9/did_sweden_accept_too_many_immigrants/drs7ywt/,tinyhouseireland,1514311019

Ethnic Russians did get citizenship if their family was in the country since forever. Ethnic Lithuanian, if he moved to Estonia during USSR times, wouldn't automatically get it.

It wasn't a huge problem in Lithuania, since only 15% or so of population were Soviet settlers. It was much bigger problem in Latvia or Estonia were well over a third of the country were such. It was very likely that if everybody had a citizenship, they'd have voted for Latvia or Estonia to join back into USSR/Russia. Which is not very welcome outcome for obvious reasons.

Russia offers (used to offer?) a reasonable return bonus. Yet not many people took up that offer.

All of this partially stems from original dispute wether USSR occupied Baltic states or they joined themselves. International law does not allow to send settlers to occupied territories. Thus not giving those settlers citizenship is natural and legal outcome.

Keep in mind many of those people did not move to Baltic states during USSR times in their free will. Many of them were sent in by various relocation schemes.

There is a special division within the nation police force,  that deals with immigration and foreigners, the Udlændingekontor. Even PET (the Danish FBI/CIA) has one. It handles visa violations, child marriages etc and other stuff the ordinary cops aren't trained for.

&gt; so the only thing that keeps it in check, is basically self policing of their own use of it.

Wrong, again. There is the Police Ombudsman, every major Danish public sector including Folketinget (the parliament) has one, so does the private sector (Forbrugerombudsmanden) to avoid them abusing their power. These institutions are independent, staffed by citizenry without shady ties and can penalize abuse of power by powerful entities or persons.

4292,"First of all I am complaining that there is a majority of people in Catalonian who are Spanish speaking who refuse to learn and use Catalan in Catalonia, even though they moved to Catalonia a long time ago. I am not saying that it's bad that they speak Spanish, I am saying that it seems normal that if someone moves to another place they should learn and speak the local language, which in Catalonia is both Catalan and Spanish because it's a bilingual society. If they don't do that, Catalonian will become a monolingual society in Spanish, something that many catalans don't want.

Secondly, it's impossible to avoid having to use and hear Spanish in Catalonia, thanks to TV and cultural influence, business and such, you cannot do the contrary in Catalan. Hence why I believe that to fully integrate yourself within Catalonia and become Catalan, you need to speak Catalan. As simple as that.

Thirdly, the Spanish Constitution by Constitutional Article obliges all Spaniards to speak and use Spanish. The Catalan statue of Autonomy does the same with Catalan. So, by law, in Catalonia you need by law speak both Spanish and Catalan, and you are allowed to use both freely. 

Having said so, what happens most of the time is that those who emigrate there don't learn how to use (albeit can understand) Catalan, and that is what I complain about.

And I'm coming off to this from the Valencian perspective, when they first tell you it's their right to not use the language, then they tell you it's their right to not understand it, then they tell you it's useless for the real world. That is why I am so adamant in regard to this.",E-Spain,/r/europe/comments/7m7l6v/amidst_the_catalan_independentist_crisis_a_new/drs8b9h/,Montsant,1514311444

4395,"&gt; I am not singing praise for USSR

You are telling people that your gramps saved the world...and that ""you are welcome"", and so on. 
As if the SU's actions for 50 years are somehow absolved because they contributed to the defeat of Germany. They annexed eastern Europe.... and it was in some cases marginally better than what the Nazis were doing to much of Europe, *but for decades longer.* 
I believe the saying is out of the frying pan and into the fire. Yeah, thanks.
The abusive lady beating rapist saved a woman from a murderer, then wrecked her life for 50 years.  ""You're welcome! Everyone should be thankful!""

&gt; Objectively, of course it was a lot better than nazi Germany, because it did not slaughter entire villages or gas entire communities based on race.

There are plenty of examples from the Soviets of horrific atrocities, and over decades,  yet here you are saying one is objectively better. 50 years of russification, deportations, executions, prison camps, oppression, stifling development and culture *may* be marginally better than a few years of Nazis. Looking for credit or thanks is amazing, and a primary issue many have with Russia. Russia lost any moral victory after 50 years of annexation and russification mixed with the belligerent attitude we've come to expect.

You'd have a point if you looked back and saw it for what it was, left it at that, and as a country expressed national regret instead of expecting thanks.
The disconnect and behavior afterward is the problem, not the original behavior.

&gt; It meets none of those definitions 

a formal agreement or treaty between two or more nations to cooperate for specific purposes.

Really....

You said it was an agreement, so now we have an agreement or treaty, and it was formal. 

&gt; They agreed how far each side would be allowed to go in these countries so that they don't start the war

 to cooperate for specific purposes, and repugnant purposes no less.

This is exactly what it was, and meets the definition.

Stalin made a deal with Hitler to annex/invade/redaw maps.  

The SU is deserving of no praise for their role in beating the Germans after this, and certainly the decades that followed.

4476,"&gt; I am not talking about endangered species. I am talking about farmers calling for culling of wild animal populations because it threatens their invasive farming techniques.

To put it more succinctly, there is almost no “wild animal”
population today that doesn’t exist *because* of agriculture.
At least not in Europe. Foxes included. The forests that
constitute their primary habitat *are* agriculture, except
for some small patches in East Poland that form the last
remnants of primeval landscape. It’s not actually possible
for “agriculture” (as in most of Humanity’s way of existence
for the last couple dozen millenia or so) to “invade” some
species’ habitat in these latitudes in any meaningful
interpetation of these terms.

Both wolves’ overall misfortune and foxes’ success are
much less induced by ignorant, bloodthirsty farmers than
by the pervasiveness of agriculture itself. Appeal to emotion
and fingerpointing at a bunch of backward idiots doesn’t
change any of that.

I know, but at a certain point it becomes a bit hypocritical IMO. You align yourself politically and economically and gain from it, and as the alignment deepens/broadens you gain more from it. But then you refuse to at least share some burdens when other countries within your alignment (whose alignment with your group benefits you as well) are faced with threats that sometimes are *because* of their alignment with you.

Of course it doesn't mean I think Ireland should be at the forefront of defence responsibility, but I do think everyone should pull their weight in some sense. Even if only monetary (which would be a dumb move on the part of the Irish but whatever). It's a bit too *fair weather friend* to my taste.

&gt;A day will come when there will be no battlefields, but markets opening to commerce and minds opening to ideas. A day will come when the bullets and bombs are replaced by votes, by universal suffrage, by the venerable arbitration of a great supreme senate which will be to Europe what Parliament is to England, the Diet to Germany, and the Legislative Assembly to France.
&gt;
&gt;A day will come when a cannon will be a museum-piece, as instruments of torture are today. And we will be amazed to think that these things once existed!
&gt;
&gt;A day will come when we shall see those two immense groups, the United States of America and the United States of Europe, facing one another, stretching out their hands across the sea, exchanging their products, their arts, their works of genius, clearing up the globe, making deserts fruitful, ameliorating creation under the eyes of the Creator, and joining together, to reap the well-being of all, these two infinite forces, the fraternity of men and the power of God.

— Opening address, Peace Congress, Paris (21 August 1849)

I'll credit him:

* Liberalism

* Universal suffrage

* Trans-Atlantic exchange

* Irrigation has certainly made land once considered desert fruitful

* Federal Europe is a prospect

I won't give him:

* Things got kinda secular, especially in Europe: God didn't quite make the party.

4715,"Used independently, it was a core part of Europe's judicial system?

&gt;Trial by ordeal was an ancient judicial practice by which the guilt or innocence of the accused was determined by subjecting them to a painful, or at least an unpleasant, usually dangerous experience. The test was one of life or death and the proof of innocence was survival. In some cases, the accused was considered innocent if they escaped injury or if their injuries healed.
&gt;
&gt;In medieval Europe, like trial by combat, trial by ordeal was considered a judicium Dei (Latin:""judgement of God""): a procedure based on the premise that God would help the innocent by performing a miracle on his behalf.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal#By_fire

&gt;Ordeal of fire typically required that the accused walk a certain distance, usually 9 feet (2.7 metres) over red-hot ploughshares or holding a red-hot iron. Innocence was sometimes established by a complete lack of injury, but it was more common for the wound to be bandaged and re-examined three days later by a priest, who would pronounce that God had intervened to heal it, or that it was merely festering—in which case the suspect would be exiled or put to death.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal#By_water

&gt;First mentioned in the 6th century Lex Salica, the ordeal of hot water required the accused to dip his hand in a kettle of boiling water and retrieve a stone.

-

&gt;According to this text, usually given the title Ordal, the water had to be close to boiling temperature, and the depth from which the stone had to be retrieved was up to the wrist for a 'one-fold' ordeal and up to the elbow for a 'three-fold' ordeal.[8] The distinction between the one-fold and three-fold ordeal appears to be based on the severity of the crime, with the three-fold ordeal being prescribed for more severe offences such as treachery or for notorious criminals.[9] The ordeal would take place in the church, with several in attendance, purified and praying God to reveal the truth. Afterwards, the hand was bound and examined after three days to see whether it was healing or festering.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7lzw0o/we_should_encourage_the_eu_to_enforce_sanctions/drrqxok/,vokegaf,1514275829

I'm really skeptical that you are getting that much more back because the average state pension in Germany is 1,263 Euros a month.

4788,"&gt;With irrelevant content.

Nothing irrelevant about calling bullshit, ""bullshit.""

&gt;Irrelevant. 

Absolutely relevant. That was the message that was originally sold to a bunch of naive idiots. Turns out it's complete and utter bullshit and early christians were a bunch of stupid idiots for falling for it.

&gt;You have personal experience what some branches of Christianity is now. You have no experience what some other branches of Christianity are now, for example Lutheran branches

I'm still waiting for you to name any branches that reject the notions of god, sin, singularity of religious truth, and other such crap. 

&gt;Not enough to make claims about all Christian branches or what Christianity was 1900 years ago

All christian branches believe the same bullshit I reject. Christianity 1900 years ago still propagated the same ""only one true truth (mine!)"" as it does today. 

&gt;Roman Empire was able to do that. 

Christianity was able to do that. The pope and all christians who forced their religion on others. Missionaries in the Americas forcing the indigenous people to convert because that's what the church wanted. The Roman Empire ceased to exist thousands of years ago, christian atrocities are still committed to this day.

&gt;Christianity is not a state

The Vatican's still there you know.

&gt;Christianity exists in liberal democracies without being a totalitarian tyrannical empire 

Because atheists, agnostics and freethinkers forced it to be so. Because people fought to have secular states and secular laws with Separation of Church and State, so that you may believe any bullshit you believe, but you have no right to make it a law over me. Not thanks to christianity.
 
&gt;You have been proven false.

No. You have been proven blatantly disregarding credit where it's due.

&gt;Only when combined with an authoritarian state.

Such as Christian Europe before the Enlightenment? Once again Spain today is a secular state: Religious freedom was guaranteed though only in 1966, nine years before the end of Franco's regime. Since 1978, according to the Spanish Constitution (section 16.3) ""No religion shall have a state character."" That's what protects freedom of speech, not christianity. You are claiming ""This tamed lion won't kill you because it's such a good and understanding beast"" when in reality it's only thanks to its tamer keeping it in check.

&gt;Yes, kingdoms. Kindgoms as in authoritarian states.

Kingdoms as in societies that believed christian bullshit and answered to a king that believed christian bullshit too. Heresy could kill a king too you know, the Pope wasn't someone you could just disregard like you do today.

&gt;states that were autocratic also in secular matters

There was no separation between secular and religious matter before the advance of scientifical and technological knowledge. You got sick and died? Well that's because you were a filthy heathen who rejected god, if you had just accepted god and repented surely god would have saved you! Too bad bacteria and viruses tend to not to care what god does. I bet they all worship Satan.

&gt;When they were a persecuted sect in Rome, they did not

Yeah, and you see how that turned out when they were not merely a sect anymore. I mourn the loss of the Roman Empire.

&gt;The Pre-Christian Roman Empire did have a problem if people did not follow the State Religion

Only christians didn't do that. Others were more than happy to compromise since hey, if my gods exist, maybe yours do too.

&gt;State religion does not mean the church gets to decide what is legal and what is not. 

Depends where in the world you ask. Islam is the state religion in muslim countries and yes, it does get to decide what is legal and what is not. If by ""state religion"" you simply mean ""what people tick the box as"" then catholicism is the state religion in Italy, yet Italy is a secular country that separates church and state (or at least it tries to, but  the principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 7 of the Constitution, which states:

""The State and the Catholic Church are independent and sovereign, each within its own sphere. Their relations are regulated by the Lateran pacts. Amendments to such Pacts which are accepted by both parties shall not require the procedure of constitutional amendments."") 

Catholicism gets special treatment by the italian government too, however nobody would dream to call it a ""state religion"". That said, the Constitution of Finland answers to and is governed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, not the bible or whatever the church says.

&gt;Churches in Finland don't even want to do that.

You sure? Christian churches, lutheran ones included, were all too happy to do that before.

&gt;So you admit your earlier claim was wrong

No. Christianity itself did nothing to become acceptable, in fact fought hard against it, or have you forgotten all the wars and killings in the name of religion Europe had? It had to be forced by secular thought to become somewhat acceptable. That shows christianity is shit, not christianity is good.

&gt;all the examples you can give are from regimes which were totalitarian any way

Hey, if your religion supports ""totalitarian regimes"" throughout all its history, even within small communities like the puritans who had no problem killing their women even without a government to tell them so (the bible did!), then maybe your religion is the problem.

&gt;When Christianity peacefully exists in liberal democracies, you say it's only because liberal secular values have forced it to be peaceful.

Yep. Finland doesn't hold the bible as its source of law. Finland holds the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as its supreme governing document and source of law, in fact it is stated to be above the constitution. It is a product of liberal secular values, not of religious belief.

&gt;How do you know it's not the autocratic regimes which made Christianity autocratic too?

Christianity was born autocratic because it pretends to hold the one absolute truth and doesn't accept disagreement. You can't be a christian priest and claim you don't believe in god. Either you accept its teachings as truth, or you're out. Do you know that meant the difference between poverty and an acceptable life when the church still held power over people?

&gt;un-christian issues like war

War has been of the most christian issues for most of christian history you know. Crusades were religious wars wanted by christians, fought in the name of religion. Wars between catholic and protestants were religious wars wanted by christians, because each group pretended to hold The One Absolute Truth and couldn't accept the other existing. The Pope still has his own army. To call war an un-christian issue is blatant dishonesty.

&gt;The core ideas of Christianity vary widely

Which branch says I can be a priest and openly profess my disbelief in god and the notion of sin exactly? 

&gt;religion is not some entity existing outside society. Religion is how society realizes it

And I have to thank the liberal, secular thought of the Enlightenment, scientifical progress, and the spread of acceptance of irreligiosity if society today realizes religion does not, in fact, hold the absolute truth and is no basis for law. It wasn't always this way, quite the opposite. I don't want society to ever go back to be religious and oppressive to people.

&gt;Christianity does not have some ""genuine core""

I'm pretty sure if you don't think there is a god, you can't be a christian. That used to get you and your family killed.

&gt;Christianity under Rome became what it became only because Roman autocracy forced it to be that way. 

No. Romans could have well kept tolerating other worships as they did before, if christianity hadn't pretended to be the only depository of truth and salvation, calling pagan religions ""demon worship"" that must be destroyed.

&gt;And the state of Rome continued to exist more than a thousand years after Christianity became the state religion.

The Western Roman Empire fell officially in 476. Anything after that was no longer the Roman Empire. It was some christian travesty that claimed the legacy of the Roman Empire for itself.

&gt;But you are militant atheist

Yeah, I am willing to use force of law first and foremost to protect my freedom, rights and liberty, should any religious fanatic ever try to rob them from me. As long as you don't even want nor try that, you're free to believe whatever you want, you do you. Much like the Roman Empire, as long as you respect my rights, I respect your rights. 

&gt;Were it not for a liberal democracy blah blah blah

I am okay with liberal democracies. Liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality, though, not on religious creed. Liberalism emerged during the Enlightenment and rejected the prevailing social and political norms of hereditary privilege, absolute monarchy, the divine right of kings, and guess what, state religion. Liberalism is against, for example, states refusing to fund abortion because many citizens object to being taxed to fund a procedure they consider (as a matter of religious teaching) murder. If you don't make it clear your religion has no right to interfere with a woman's choice, women may be forced to either risk their lives with unsafe abortions, or be forced to give birth against their will, which can well be a traumatic, crippling, disastrous event for the woman. That's not acceptable. The christian work called the Didache (c. 150 AD) says: ""Do not murder a child by abortion."" Nevermind a fetus is not a child. Thanks for setting women's rights back for centuries, early christians.

Though looking at religious places like the Middle East and seeing what democracy brought there (more religious oppression!) I am more okay with liberal democracies that openly uphold liberal, secular values over religion, and keep religion in check.

Wikipedia isn't enough? All right: worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Censorship/Christian Intolerance.htm

&gt;Militant atheism, your ideology 

My ideology is that freedom of choice is the most important and the only true sacrosanct thing in the world, and I am militant about that because I have seen what totalitarian religions are capable of. Better safe than sorry, Romans were already stupid enough once to lose everything to religious fanatics.

&gt;China and USSR had militant atheism. Your ideology.

China and USSR had communism. As I have already repeteadly stated I prefer the way of contemporary Japan or any other western secular state.

&gt;your claim that your personal experience would be somehow valid in describing how people in the second century felt about Christianity

For the umpteenth time, I don't give a shit how those naive idiots felt, it's clear to me now they fell for a bunch of bullshit, and I have every right to hate them for that.

&gt;It does not matter.

Yes it does. It's hypocritical to claim to be something and then disagree with the core principles of that something. Catholics even more than others because they're supposed to do what the pope says.

&gt;Your claim that Christians censorship different opinions.

Try being openly an atheist and saying ""god doesn't exist"" when freedom of opinion was not something the SECULAR government had forced and imposed on churches. People died for that. ""Atheist"" used to be a criminal charge, and if it isn't anymore once again it's not thanks to christianity.

&gt;I provided an example of such country

Spain applies Separation of Church and State and is a secular country too. Their laws are based on the Declaration of Human Rights, not on the bible. Christians by secular law are forced to respect the rights of non-christians. Therefore freedom of speech exists because Spain is dominated by Secularism, not by christianity. And like Italy, most of those ""christians"" are called so out of lazyness, when in fact they don't care about religion.

So, how can freedom of speech exist in a Christian dominated country?

Read above.

&gt;this only goes to demonstrate how the atrocities by Christianity were dependent on the authoritarian governments. 

Not just goverments. The populace  believed a bunch of bullshit fed by churches/pastors that legitimized the goverment in its ways. And they all found justification for their horrors in the teachings of christianity, because it taught them totalitarian bullshit that was perfect to justify oppression and genocide. The government is not same mythical separate entity, it's made of and supported by christians who wanted to apply their religion as it is.

&gt;But pre-Christian Rome was not like that. 

Romans allowed you to keep your culture and gods, as long as you added worship of the emperor to your worship of your gods. Christians did not. Christians demanded you give up your culture and gods or die.

Ponder this. This is not a wholly deductive proof.

P2: Some form of life begins at conception, and a child being born is at least considered human.

P3: Jesus was a human male. Divine, but also human with human frailties, hence the crucifixion.

P4: Human males have penises.

P5: The act of sex, which is the passing of a penis of a living human through a vagina, ends the condition known as ""virginity.""

C1/P6: Therefore, the act of birth, where the entire body of a living human passes through the vagina, including the penis, would end a woman's virginity (P2-P5).

C2: Jesus could not have been a vaginal birth (P1, P6).

4993,"I’m an incremental socialist so I’m opposed to the EU’s commitment to marketisation and economic liberalism. I also disagree significantly with the ECJR and EUCFR (and with the UDHR, for that matter) about which rights and obligations are desirable and beneficial in society. Thus I would strengthen some rights and weaken or abolish others, and so treaties which tie trade to that kind of principles stuff are a major nuisance. 


I’m also opposed on a pragmatic level to some of the EU and Council of Europe’s rules which are claimed to promote democracy because IMO they  undermine it: for example IMO the press should be required to be absolutely politically neutral in anything presented in a manner which could be mistaken for factual content, political activism should be limited to electors within their own constituencies, and paid political activities should be heavily limited. 

IMO the EU is too large to be practically democratic (so is Greater London but there’s no sensible border further in for it, and the current border is probably smaller than makes sense, and as I support a managed reduction in population that will in time resolve itself), but I’m not really interested in the direction of the EU if it can’t be abolished, only about mitigating the harm our continued dependence caused while we disentangle England from it and transition the economy to focus on those sectors which more directly support the wellbeing of the people and which are not so susceptible to capital flight (which makes the British GDP such a lousy measure of the wealth actually available for society). 

I think the majority of the British population wants greater government involvement in the economy, though the majority are conservatives rather than socialists, and I’d prefer that they win in the short term because they also need to rebalance and disentangle the British economy but that way they’ll get the blame for the disruption.

And you can't deny it. Serbs had suffered more and still continue to do so, unfortunately.

5012,"I'll answer to any comment I please.

&gt;Which only goes to demonstrate how you are wrong.

What was the original slogan? ""One god, one savior, one truth for all""?

&gt;you do not have personal experience of all forms of Christianity 

Again, which form of christianity allows disbelief in god and all christian  theology?

&gt;Now you admit that you do not have that experience to make the claim you just did.

I was forced against my will to go to church and waste time attending catechism listening to people praise an evil jew god and attempting to instill irrational fears in me. Yes, I do have enough experience with christianity.

&gt;If a religion is unable to do that, it's not a totalitarian tyrannical regime

Too bad christianity was amply able to do that, so yes it is a totalitarian tyrannical regime.

&gt;For example the Evangelic Lutheran church of Finland is unable to impose authoritarian methods in Finland

That's because Finland is one of the most secular, atheistic societies in the world. Not even the christians there take christianity seriously. How sad.

&gt;Because that's what they believe. 

And it's wrong. The fact that for centuries I could not have said this to their face lest I forfeited my life, my family's life, my property and my future is testament to how dangerous such a belief is.

&gt;Roman empire utilized religion to rule.

Christian kingdoms utilized religion to rule even after the dissolution of the Empire. Christians hanged women for wanting freedom and material goods in America, and that was many centuries after the Roman Empire had ceased to exist. Charlemagne the heroic christian king genocided 4500 pagans because they didn't want to convert. It is the religion that is rotten at its core, pretending to control people in every aspect of their life.

&gt; It wasn't Christianity with resorted to those methods. 

Except they did. Christian emperors resorted to those methods against pagans with the aid and blessing of christian bishops and christian saints. And they continued to do that afted the empire ended, because their religion encouraged them to do so.

&gt;Roman Empire would not have done it before being Christian.

The Roman Empire did in fact have no problem with other religions before christianity, because other religions were civilized enough to accept the legitimity of the Roman gods as well. Christians were not. That's what started the hostility.

&gt;State religions of Finland 

Finland does not have a state religion. Finland is a secular country whose laws are based on the principle of Separation of Church and State. Churches get tax exemptions but they do not get to decide what is legal in Finland and what is not, the secular government does. And churches in Finland are to respect the law of the secular government, for example they can't burn atheists and heretics at the stake because murder is against the law, murder of everyone not just murder of good christians.
 
&gt;So you then admit that it is that way

Again, only because atheism and secularism forced it to be that way. If it were up to christians they would still be all too happy to discriminate and kill people for heresy.

&gt;your claims about Christianity are not universal 

What christian branch doesn't pretend to hold the absolute truth and indiscriminately allows disbelief in god? 

&gt;the authoritarianism of Christianity exists because states forced it to be that way

No, it exists because christianity is a totalitarian regime that doesn't allow disagreement at its core. If it weren't, it wouldn't pretend to hold the absolute truth, and it would be perfectly okay with disbelief and disinterest. Even my small parish priest was not okay with me not giving a shit what god said.

&gt;that's only thanks to politics and governments and power hungry rules and conquerors who utilize Christianity to gain more power and influence and money and persecute those who question your political authority

No. It's also thanks to christianity lending itself perfectly to such abuse due to its ideas being wrong at the core. There is no absolute truth in religion. In fact, there is no god and there more than likely is no afterlife. All christianity's core tenets are nothing but tools to control an ignorant, scared population.

&gt;But the fact it is a private matter proves you are wrong about Christianity. 

Again, no? Just because a tamed beast can be trusted not to immediately kill you doesn't mean a wild beast won't kill you, or that the tamed one will never kill you if you forget it's a predatory beast with killings instincts and all. The fact that it's tamed is thanks to the tamer, not thanks to the beast suddenly becoming civilized and all.

&gt;Christians in the first centuries, before it became the state religion of Rome, forced their beliefs on others. 

Early christians ARE still those who gained power in the roman empire, destroyed it and forced their beliefs on others. I have given you plenty of proof of that.

&gt;Communist states

I am generally pro-capitalism, try again.

5021,"I should note that there was a dubious bit of legality surrounding the American Civil War: Lincoln's legal basis for blocking secession was that [states *could not secede*](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/secessiontableofcontents.htm) and had never really left.  Based on that, they shouod never have lost their voting power.  However, in the aftermath of the Civil War, the Union rammed through her legislative agenda while the ""unseceded"" states were ""waiting for readmission"".  So I guess that you could call this in some ways comparable to Article 7.  However, it left a lot of bitter feeling on top of the existing unhappiness, and I think that in retrospect, it was a bad idea.  If they hadn't just failed in a long and bloody secession attempt, it likely would have touched off secession.

It is not part of any normal US legal mechanism to remove a state's political powers.

I also suspect that if you create, say, a vote-strip with a lower bar, you will tend to create defensive blocs of states that agree to block removal of each others' powers, and that these will be just large enough to defeat the mechanism.  Removal of political power is just too damned dangerous for states to start permitting, because of the positive feedback loop.

That is, the reason you have a two-state bloc now is only because you have a all-minus-one vote-strip.  If it required three states, I suspect that you'd get that.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7m3apl/hungary_vows_to_block_any_eu_bid_to_punish_poland/drrelh8/,vokegaf,1514253625

5042,"&gt; It shouldn't if it would be fully fair. This is the west abusing its power over Kosovo, creating a court strictly out of prejudice towards Albanians.

The West giveth, the West taketh away. 

I doubt they have any prejudices towards Albanians, or that they care about Serb victims. This is the West showing who's the boss and strengthening their hold on Kosovo.

&gt;Haradinaj went willingly to court twice and was freed, same with others.

That was back when the narrative of innocent Albanians was desirable to support the ""independence"". 

The situation now is different, and the West seems to be looking for something to put the pressure on the Albanian leadership. They're going after Haradinaj's brother right off the bat. It's blackmail.

5053,"&gt; Yet to post any actual source with numbers as you claimed Serbs were the biggest victims.

You're implying like it's the only one source needed. On Wikipedia. That's not how you debate someone, you know.

&gt; In the Kosovo war the most murder victims were Albanian civilians. The most expelled people were Albanians. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War I don't know if you're lacking in reading comprehension or what it is, but that's a fact, take your time and read through it. Go through the sources as well if you wish.

You don't get my point. I'm not denying that the most killed civilians are Albanians in that event, but the most killed **and** expelled civilians who never returned back because their houses got demolished or resettled by others, were ultimately Serbs. So Serbs are the biggest victims there.

Also, you do realize you put the numbers in a proportion when you want to compare them, yes?

&gt; You've only showed some claims of expulsions, nothing that compares to hundreds of thousands of Albanians slaughtered and more expelled. So I assume you're done here.

They had no interest in Western Europe or Britain and only occupied them for one of three reasons:

1.) Strategic necessity (Denmark and the Netherlands had to be invaded in order to make the invasion of important targets like France and Norway possible). Britain was only attacked because of their continued air attacks on Germany and their insistence on creating battlegrounds against the Germans anywhere they could. They preferably had to remove Britain as a threat before the invasion of the Soviet Union.

2.) Their neutrality was compromised by Churchill/Britain (Yugoslavia and Norway)

3.) In order to assist their Italian ally and prevent their capitulation to the British forces (Greece, Crete, North Africa). Churchill was condemned for his strategy of putting British military forces in other European countries and thereby getting them invaded by the Germans and then withdrawing British troops. Churchill wanted to spread German resources as wide as he could, even if it meant bringing death and destruction to innocent countries.

5143,"&gt;That's not a source for violent rejection. 

Yes it is. Christianity burned people at the stake for having different interpretations of the same texts, forcibly converted indigenous people whenever it had the power to, the charge of atheism was used to attack political or religious opponents. Atheistic beliefs were seen as threatening to order and society by christian thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas. Why do you think the Catholic Church was forced to publicly apologize for its crimes and admit you cannot force religion on anyone? Because under the excuse of holding the absolute truth it committed atrocities of billions of people throughout its existence.

&gt;your claim is dismissed, you are wrong

I am right. You refuse to look at christian history.

&gt;Because you support an ideology which murders and oppresses. 

An ideology that recognizes and protects individual freedom of choice? How does that murder and oppress anyone? Does my lack of forced subservience to your god oppress you?

For the record, bringing up China and Russia all the time doesn't mean anything to me. I'm not a communist and I don't approve of communism. China is still atheist and it has gotten much better after its ruling party has let go of communist ideas, Japan is overwhelmingly atheist and it's a much better society than any religious shithole, Western Europe and America are increasingly secular and non-believing and they're much better off than the religious shitholes they were. Freedom from religion is a wonderful thing.

&gt;So you agree than Christians too can and do appreciate and create art and that your previous claim was incorrect.

Some can, sure. I don't think they're good christians though when they are so blatantly disregarding the teachings of their own god, that clearly says ""Don't appreciate anything besides me!"" I can't call  myself a christian when my ideas are so much in contradiction with the bullshit christianity feeds me, maybe they can but most people seem to prefer coherency.

&gt;For example almost 60% of Spanish people are Christian and believe in God (and 70% identify as Catholic)

If they identify as catholic, why do they legally allowed the practice of homosexual marriage, hormonal birth control, and legal abortion? Catholic doctrine is clearly against those and in fact catholics tried to oppose the legalization of such practices. Either they're hypocrites who proclaim one thing but then do another, or they're not really catholic. I myself identify as a catholic on official papers because I was baptized and forced to attend mass and catechism until Confirmation, but I despise catholic doctrine and I am coherent enough with myself to openly state so.

&gt;The reason the atrocities you speak of do not happen in Christian dominate countries because those countries tend to have governments which don't practice those atrocities. 

And again, that's thanks to centuries of liberalism and secular thought that fought against the power of religion and the Church. 
In the Reformation and Counter-Reformation eras, Europe was a ""persecuting society,"" which did not tolerate religious minorities or atheism. Even in France, where the Edict of Nantes had been issued in 1598, then revoked in 1685, there was very little support for religious toleration at the beginning of the eighteenth century. States were concerned with maintaining religious uniformity for two reasons: first, they believed that their chosen confession was the way to God and other religions were heretical, and second, religious unity was necessary for social and political stability. The advancement of toleration was the result of pragmatic political motives as well as the principles espoused by Enlightenment philosophes, not thanks to religion worshippers suddenly deciding to be kind and generous and tolerant to all.

&gt;Those practices were due to authoritarian government and happened regardless of religion.

No. If your religion states ""Other beliefs in other gods are OK, you are free to believe what you want or not believe at all."" then no authoritarian government can use it to oppress people, because you are upholding the principle of freedom of choice. However if your religion states ""I follow the One True Truth and anyone who doesn't agree is in the cahoots with Satan"" then yeah, your religion is lending itself to be used to oppress people no problem.

 &gt;that's another Abrahamic religion believing they are one true belief and who have Jesus Christ as their prophet

Exactly. Jesus Christ is only one of their prophets though, nowhere as important as Muhammad, and if you're a blasphemer in islam if you imply Jesus was the son of god.

5190,"Put everything on the table then, I'm the only one doing it at this point. You literally presented two cases where Albanians were the biggest victims. Using the 2004 unrests as an argument against past expulsions of Albanians shows how you're only out for manipulation, rather than actual facts. If Albanians could survive the past slaughters of hundreds of thousands, how come the 2004 unrest was the major deal that ended the Serbs? Do you have no connection to the land?

Big Serbian victims, yet majority of casualties being Albanian civilians who were killed by Serbian forces outside of combat. Nice logic, I really can't tell if you're intentionally looking to humiliate your own intelligence or if brainwashing is that intense. http://www.truth-commission.com/?p=295

Regarding expulsion, significantly more Albanians got expelled during the Kosovo war compared to Serbs. The fact that many Serbs didn't want to remain after they had tried to exterminate their neighbors makes sense, and is their own problem. 

I go by victims here, not about emotional arguments. Vast majority of civilian deaths were Albanians killed by Serbs outside of combat. In terms of military deaths they were low in comparison to the civilian deaths. In terms of expulsion a good million of Albanians were expelled, meanwhile the total on Serbs is around 205 thousand, 1/5 of the Albanian number. Is it possible to make it clearer? Just because you don't move back doesn't mean you got it worse.

I am mostly familiar with Hungarian history only, but the distinction here between hereditary lands, and lands tied to an office clearly existed in the Xth century, so it must have existed elsewhere in Europe too.

5202,"My background is first year in a 3,5 year program to become a social worker. Most people in my class are quite left-leaning and open to migration and so am I.

In my opinion the problem is not the numbers in itself, it's how it was handled. I think it's a great act to help people in need (hence my studies) but it was naïve to think you could do such large changes and not make sure the systems could handle it. We have the resources for it, if we allocate them right (also, I don't mind a small raise in taxes to help pay for this). 

We should also not be afraid to admit that SD was right in that it is cheaper and sometimes even better to the individual to help some of the groups closer to where they fled from, at least those who flee from war. This is also not true for all, don't forget that the people who come here are very different in their needs. Also I don't agree with SD at all in their politics, they distort the nature of the problems and come up with solutions that are either inhumatiarian or just don't work.

When it comes to the people we accept they need help earlier. We need something more serious and well funded than we have now. Something that will help immigrants navigate in the Swedish society. This should be better fitted to suit the individual, an iranian academic do not have the same needs as an illiterate farmer from a mountain village in Afghanistan. 

In my opinion, the problems on the pro imimgration side is either not caring until it becomes a problem (rather than preventing it), uninterest in discussing the problems on a deeper level (and thus giving the issue to the other side). Also pro-immigrants like to paint anti-immigrants as racists and refuse to discuss the issue with them. Real bad for progress, in my opinion.

Imo the anti-immigration side tend to pick the weirdest thing a pro-immigrant has said and pretend that it's the opinion of everyone on the other side. I don't know how many times, here on reddit and in real life, I have to point out the same false beliefs like ""why do you people not see that there are problems?"". We do see the problem but have different opinions on how to solve them.

TL;DR
*I'm ok with immigration.
*It's not the number of immigrants, but our poor handling that causes problems.
*SD do not have a good solution to our problem
*Prevent problems, don't solve them.

5208,"&gt;And no, Roman =/= christian.

After Christianity became the state religion, most of Romans ended up being Christian. The Romans built [this world renowed Christian church](https://cdn.getyourguide.com/img/tour_img-665631-148.jpg), even though you claim they hated places of religious worship, that they hated art and such.

&gt;Romans were majority pagans and they were persecuted by christians.

Romans persecuted all who did not take part in the state religion. Romans persecuted Christians when Christians did not take part in the Roman pagan state religion. That was not a Christian thing. It was a Roman thing. Romans persecuted Romans too, if the Romans were Christans. How can you not know history of the religion and state you claim to know so much about:

""[*The persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire was carried out by the state and also by local authorities on a sporadic, ad hoc basis, often at the whims of local communities. Starting in 250, empire-wide persecution took place by decree of the emperor Decius. The edict was in force for eighteen months, during which time some Christians were killed while others apostatised to escape execution.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire)""

Rome continued this principle when Rome became Christian. And then Christianity became the dominant religion for Romans, and it continued to be the religion of Romans for 1000 years.

This only goes to demonstrate how militant atheist like you are fanatics and fundamentalists who refuse to believe in facts and refuse to acknowledge they are wrong.

&gt;Since 2015, he said, about 260,000 refugees have already returned to Syria, primarily from Turkey.

Is that hundreds of thousands or not? What is your problem with reading comprehension?

The article says over half a million internally displaced people returned to their homes and over a quarter of a million returned from outside the country. That is over THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION people who have RETURNED to their homes.

No, it was an attempt at an argument. You brought Israel in the statement to in order to push for the conclusion that regime change in Iraq was Saudi. You put Israel there to try to make your argument look legitimate. 

&gt;This is Phil 101

Well it clearly shows that you failed that course since you can't differentiate between arguments and non arguments. 

[Try to read this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument):

&gt;In logic and philosophy, an argument is a series of statements typically used to persuade someone of something or to present reasons for accepting a conclusion.[1][2] The general form of an argument in a natural language is that of premises (variously propositions, statements or sentences) in support of a claim: the conclusion.[3][4][5] 

&gt;Wikipedia sees no issue. There is no violation

Wikipedia isn't a person. Editors can remove/edit claims as they see fit as long as it respects Wiki policy. The lack of further editing is not evidence of a text being valid, unless it was a very visited article. The article [hasn't really gotten much attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Governmental_positions_on_the_Iraq_War_prior_to_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq&amp;offset=&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history) in comparison to other articles like [the article about the war in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iraq_War&amp;offset=&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history).

&gt;Once again posting a link of Wikipedia rules is not proof of a violation.

Actually it is evidence to suggest a text violates a Wikipedia editorial policy. That's what sourcing a claim does, to show backing of an assertion by an authority (in this case Wikipedia authority).

The ignorant in this case would have to go get confirmation by others in Wikipedia. Go ask them, they'll tell you the same. Don't be shy, it's the internet afterall. If you make a wiki account, you can be anonymous. But if you're as thin skinned in Wikipedia as you're being right now, then expect to have your cortisol level raised.

5357,"&gt; The view that doctrinal divisions contributed much to the Roman losses against the early Arab armies is widely rejected by modern scholarship. The Romans lost their oriental provinces because their armies were defeated in battle and the empire was unable to retake them because resources were already severely strained. Local Christians did not have much say in this and lacked the means to hinder or help the Arab advance. They may have been critical of the emperor but that doesn’t mean that they welcomed the Muslims with open arms. For example the Miaphysite author John of Nikiu describes the Arab conquest of Egypt in rather negative terms.

The crisis of the 7th century also didn’t lead to the collapse of the Eastern Roman Empire. It managed to later regain much of its strength and survived for another eight centuries.

Wikipedia is awful source. For example read Gibbons The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Jesus wars is another excellect book to highlight how religious authority rose over civil and central authority collapsed.  

Syria and Egypt had particulary strong view of Christianity, and because Constantinople supported neither view both areas simply surrendered to Arabs while Anatolia followed central authority.

5430,"&gt; In fact, a lot of pretty clever people have formulated baskets of products that reflect the average consumption patterns of the population, and use those to establish the PPP deflator.

Yeah, and my complaint is that those people are not selecting equivalent baskets. In fact, it's really hard to select an equivalent basket in different cultures because the goods they like differ. If you go with a similar looking basket for everyone then your basket is not similar to the things the people living there buy and thus the prices could be different. On the other hand, if you go for a basket that takes into account what people buy then you're comparing different baskets of goods.

Also, you call cheese an edge case here. What if you add milk, bread and gasoline to the mix?

&gt;So it's funny how you forgot to mention the cost of housing

I *specifically* mentioned housing and even mentioned how the housing situation is maybe part of the reason why this GDP PPP seems to not work when comparing Estonia and Finland, because the older generation owns homes from Soviet times. There are a lot less renters here. However, the younger generation here is in a situation more comparable to Finland.

&gt;What you're talking about are edge cases. People don't spend most of their income on cheese nor electronics.

If you build about as powerful of a computer you can get you're going to pay around 1500 euros for this. This is &gt;150% of monthly net income.

&gt;I've never even made a single thread about Bosnian war on this profile or my old one.

[Look at all these threads that have nothing to with war related stuff](https://www.reddit.com/user/hrulj_milisic/posts/). You are nitpicking. You know what I meant, I don't want to explain myself to you.

&gt; It starts with ""everyone did shit in the war, we're all the same, foreigners made us fight"" and ends with ""8000 waaah"" and gloating in war crimes.

You have been talking to people similar to you, keyboard warriors. Do you seriously think 8+ million people think that? INB4 yes

1. I have no percentage, why would there be percentages for this kind of stuff? That being said I'm pretty sure the majority of Serbian people think that, myself included. (Though I do think you do have quite a bit to do with us, but are a separate people and I respect that). Again, most people that don't think that are far-right nationalists and keyboard warriors.

2. Again, have no percentage, but I think most people are aware of that. Also more Serbs who lived outside the borders have been exterminated that the Bosniaks and Croats living inside them. It was war, and all sides did some shit, not only mine.

3. Probably almost zero. Why would it be removed? The majority there are Serbs, and they probably don't want to be governed by the same government as the others, as it would most certainly be unfair.

The EU is first and foremost a union of secular countries and there is absolutely nothing in the European treaties that would suggest otherwise. Freedom of religion on the other hand is one of the core values that the EU is championing. Religion hasn’t played a role in the formation of alliances in Europe for quite a while now.

Say you have two countries of equal population size that grows by 5% in nominal terms over 5 years. Yet one of those countries had 3% inflation and the other had 1%. In real terms, one of them is better off but in nominal terms they will have the same per capita GDP. 

PPP is only adjusting for currency volatility, but you also have to adjust PPP for inflation. For instance, Greece's per capita income in current prices (PPP) increase from 2010-2014, but in real terms it declined. 

So you need to use both PPP *and* adjust for inflation. OP did neither.

It has grown to such a kinder garden approach that the Social democrats of Sweden and Denmark, (historical sister parties helping with the common development of the Nordic welfare state), are not sending representatives to each others annual summits. reason being a clear disagreement in immigration policies.

When the Danish Minister of Integration Inger Støjberg in 2015 ran adds in the middle east telling would be refugees not to come to Denmark. Her Swedish counterpart said Sweden have reached its max. Denmark has not.

Especially in 2015 the foreign ministers of Sweden and Denmark were very keen on relaying the information that neither nation were responsible for the others foreign policies. 

There were also a question of common protocol that was neglected. After a national election it is normal practice for the neighboring nation to congratulate the new government (winner). Those letters were not written or delivered for a few years.

Denmark had the better campaign than the later added Stockholm bid. Which meant that Skåne supported Copenhagen, but when it was clear that Stockholm would not advance in the competition, the Swedish government did not support Copenhagen.

Oh please, spare me. I don't think you can argue about Croatia being ""spared"" anything since apparently we're now to blame for Bosnia while you *aren't*.

As for the acquittals. If you're talking about Gotovina&amp;co, that whole case was nonsense, and here's why:

*Even of they were guilty, the case was nonsense, and they would have walked anyways.*

We think that it was written for Frenki and Šušak and that lot, but they had the bad grace to die on Del Ponte before she could lynch them. Imagine if Slobo died on her... so she's left with much slimmer pickings down the command chain. But she still wants to swing wide, prosecute it under the ""joint criminal enterprise"" gimmick which Hague invented to deal with us nasty Balkanites.

So... she mostly keeps the original case, BUT now the masterminds are missing.

Of course it blows up in her face.

And that's before we come to, you know, the lack of physical proof. Hague invented that ""200 meter rule"" to prove excessive shelling - if a shell falls more than 200 meters away from military targets, it's ""proof"" for intentional organized action against civilians.

Nevermind that such a rule didn't even exist in 1995 (what the fuck, retroactively applying laws now?), military experts criticized it for being a pile of nonsense it is. (What would be the end result of this being implemented into war-doctrine... except the armies dispersing even more among civilians, using them as meat-shields?)

Anyways.

If she was smarter/more humble, she could have gone for the burned-houses for example, there were enough of them to cast reasonable doubt at least.

1. I do believe that authoritarian governments can be ""successful"" in short term situations. Especially in terms of economics I do believe that they have positive short term effects. They tend to align with the wealthy which will in turn make them feel more positive and safe in terms of investments. This will lead to an economic growth and even positive effects for normal citizens. In the long term however I think those policies favor the rich and tend to try to keep up the ""old"" ways which leads to stagnation for ordinary citizens or even economic troubles due to a lack of adaptation.

2. Having an authoritarian government can be nice because you do not have to worry so much. If everything is in the hands of the dear leader and things are not too bad, you can just live your live without to worry. That effect happens even in democracies.

ITT: people who think Sweden's only immigrants are North Africans and Middle Easterners.

As for my answer: it'd be *very* hard to disprove the idea that EU immigration made Sweden's economy worse overall; housing prices are definitely up, partly because of more immigrants and partly because cities have become more and more popular to live in (although really, the blame here should be on the government and not the people); and as for culture... it's definitely *changed* - for example, English has quickly become a major language (even if the government is still in denial about it), and even things like Swedish holidays have become half-Americanised - but not in ways that could be objectively considered worse. It's a big concern for people that want to preserve their culture, but for everyone else, it's a resounding mix of ""meh"" and ""Hey, this 'halloween' thing sounds kinda nifty"".

5602,"&gt; I think you just chose your route badly.

It's the road offered by google maps. Go there. Type Sevilla Sanlucar press the little cyclist and that's what you'll get. 

&gt; You can't just tell Google Maps to route you somewhere and expect it to work, 

That's what I always do in France and I never had a road that comes anywhere close to how shitty these were. 


Now looking at normal roads, and it gives me detours. No direct normal road between them. WTF?

&gt; I've had it route me literally through fields.

You sure it wasn't one of those most amazing roads in Europe you keep mentioning?

&gt; My experience with small mountain roads in Andalucia was more like this.

Everybody has amazing mountain roads. French alps, Italian alps, Suisse Alps. They all have awesome mountain roads. I'm looking for roads to tour between cities. 

&gt; And drivers in Spain IMO have a lot of respect for cyclists and a lot of respect for it as a sport, and are quite nice to bikers IMO. 

I didn't have any problems with drivers (though I have yet to put some serious kms in Spain) but no one wants to bike and have huge lorries and cars going 90km/h fly past them. 

&gt; Spain would definitely be up there for me as one of the best countries in the world for cycling, no question.

Now looking to cycle to cadiz. No fucking normal way to cycle in the city. The two main bridges are not allowed for cyclists. The third entry by the south is part highway so cannot cycle on it. 

There only remains a gravel road by the south. Fuck that again. It is very frustrating for a cyclist.

You act like an extremist.

&gt; Especially the hatred of beauty in human works such as temples and statues

Uh, yea. Christians really seem to hate [religious places of worship](https://images2.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3080/2/16x9/1200.jpg) and [statues](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Michelangelo%27s_Pieta_5450_cropncleaned_edit.jpg/1200px-Michelangelo%27s_Pieta_5450_cropncleaned_edit.jpg) and [art](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/%27Adam%27s_Creation_Sistine_Chapel_ceiling%27_by_Michelangelo_JBU33cut.jpg/600px-%27Adam%27s_Creation_Sistine_Chapel_ceiling%27_by_Michelangelo_JBU33cut.jpg)

&gt;the censorship of different opinions

Why is this not evident in every country where Christianity dominates? Because it is not true.

&gt;the wanting to destroy precious, beautiful art and literature is the hallmark of a crazy evil person.

Ooh I can play this game too! You are a crazy evil person because you want to persecute and slaughter Christians. No sources needed. You just are. Militant atheists like you destroyed Christian art. Militant atheists like you slaughtered religious people. You are an extremist.

You do realize that you are a crazy evil person, a extremist? You are willing to ignore facts such as the [Pantheon](https://static.thousandwonders.net/Pantheon.Rome.original.1785.jpg) originally a Roman pagan temple and one of the best preserved Roman buildings *survives because it was transformed into a church*.  Likewise Christian monasteries were crucial to the preservation of Ancient texts. Monasteries did not burn ancient knowledge, but protected them.

Edit. Apparently the matter isn't settled yet:

&gt;Since the 2000s, the extinct Homo sapiens idaltu (White et al., 2003) has gained wide recognition as a subspecies of Homo sapiens, but even in this case there is a dissenting view arguing that ""the skulls may not be distinctive enough to warrant a new subspecies name"".[38] H. s. neanderthalensis and H. s. rhodesiensis continue to be considered separate species by some authorities, but the genetic evidence of archaic human admixture with modern humans discovered in the 2010s has re-opened the details of taxonomy of archaic humans.[39]

Aside from how daft your comparison is, tourists tend to move by themselves.

Who is talking about logistics? Jesus Christ...
Taking back hundreds of thousands, of not millions of people, requires a specific bureaucratic process. They need to be all found, accounted for, registered and then be either asked to leave or send home. And that doesn't even account for how many will be allowed to stay due to requesting asylum due to the treatment that can be expected by Assad's regime. 

Logistics is the least of the problems.

5819,"&gt;Amending existing treaties as opposed to replacing them with a constitution has is a very strong message about the future of EU. 

The message is ""we will shove the superstate down your throats in one way or another, whether you like it or not"".

&gt;official anthem and an official flag implies a country

Both of those are *de facto* in use anyway.

&gt;Of course if you support the actions of Poland

I support everything that will stop, or at least delay the further federalization of EU. I don't really support this particular Polish reform (but then again, I don't like the previously existing system in Poland either), but I see it as a great way to highlight the lack of power of EU's insritutions and confirming the principle of countries' sovereignity. Poland wins and EU loses in every pissible scenario - either we don't get punished thanks to Hungary (Romania/Austria/Czechia/Lithuania) backing us up, and the ""nuclear option"" is proven to be worthless - or we get punished, only due to EU breaking its own procedures and including whoever would potentially support us in a joint action that is against the treaties. EU either gets proven to be powerless, or loses all moral authority through breaking principles of rule of law in order to punish supposed ""violations"" of rule of law. Either way, EU is not getting out from this conflict stronger than it entered it, and this is all that matters.

OpenStreetMap is a Wikipedia of maps - people as hobby create worldwide collection of geographic data - mapping of things ranging from oceans, forests, peaks through motorways, volcanoes and buildings to cycleways, shops, bicycle parkings and colours of benches.

Anyone may help and contribute, I recommend StreetComplete android app. It asks simple questions like ""what is the name of this road"" that are immediately used to improve OSM data (and that data may be used by anybody, it is not owned by some corporation). It requires no knowledge about OSM to help with mapping. And there is http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/introduction/ as introduction to more advanced mapping.

It's OK to get drunk (not a fan myself but hey), to be silly once in awhile, you don't have to be serious all the time. I've found that people who try to ""show off"" how serious and mature they are all the time try to make up for uh.. intellectual deficiencies, surrounding themselves in an aura of ""seriousness"" and ""maturity"". You don't have to take yourself so seriously all the time!

But then you have these people all the way on the other side of the spectrum... why? Do you really have no measure? No decency at all? As I said you don't have to go back to Victorian values, but, where exactly do you stop? Nowhere, it seems.
