Overall, based on the indicators selected to monitor the SDGs in an EU context, the EU made progress towards most goals over the past five years. Progress in some goals was faster than in others, and movement away from the sustainable development objectives occurred in specific areas of a number of goals as well as for two goals overall. These trends are described in the thematic chapters on the individual SDGs in the monitoring report. Not all indicators are already using 2020 data, which means that the findings presented here sometimes refer to the situation before the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
The EU made most progress over the last 5 years towards the overall achievement of SDG 16 ‘Peace, justice and strong institutions’.  
  
Significant progress was also visible in reducing poverty and social exclusion (SDG 1) and in improving the EU’s health situation (SDG 3). However, due to the time lag of the respective indicators, the assessment of the two goals on poverty (SDG 1) and health (SDG 3) still refers to the period up to 2019 and therefore does not yet reflect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
The assessment of the remaining goals to some extent already takes into account the pandemic, with COVID-19 markedly slowing the reported average progress. In the area of the economy and the labour market (SDG 8), the COVID-19 crisis has interrupted the continuous improvement observed since 2013. Similar impacts can be observed in the areas of education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), other inequalities (SDG 10) as well as global partnerships and means of implementation (SDG 17), where 2020 data show a clear deterioration for individual indicators.  
  
Moderate progress is visible for sustainable cities (SDG 11), consumption and production (SDG 12), sustainable agriculture (SDG 2) and R&amp;D and innovation (SDG 9). For these goals 2020 data are not yet available, therefore their assessment reflects the period before the onset of the pandemic.  
  
On the basis of the current set of indicators, the overall assessment of SDG 13 ‘Climate action’ remains more or less neutral. Positive trends are visible for climate mitigation (e.g. the growing share of renewable energy) and support to climate action (e.g. growing financial support to developing countries). The assessment is negatively affected by the intensifying climate impacts such as rising mean temperatures. It is also based on past progress and not on projections of future emissions based on planned or adopted legislation and policy measures. With the recent agreement on the European Climate Law, the existing EU climate and energy legislation will be revised.  
  
Two goals — SDG 7 ‘Affordable and clean energy’ and SDG 15 ‘Life on land’ overall show a slight movement away of the EU from the respective Sustainable Development objectives. In the case of SDG 7, this overall slightly negative assessment is due to increases in the EU’s energy consumption in the period from 2014 to 2019 and thus does not yet reflect the — at least temporary — reductions expected for 2020. The assessment of SDG 15 shows that ecosystems and biodiversity remain under pressure from human activities.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/o0zw3k/eu_progress_towards_the_17_sustainable/h1y38ix/,filosoful,1623831453

106,"No, I am not referring to the white eagle, I am referring to the Serbian cross with 4 Cyrillic 'S' symbols (Cyrillic 'S' is written as 'C') which is actually Byzantine Tetragrammatic Cross with 4 Cyrillic 'V' (Cyrillic 'V' is written as 'B'). This cross is usually on the shield in front of the white eagle. More at the link:


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_flags_and_insignia#Tetragrammatic_cross


Serbian version:


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_cross


To make things even worse, Serbs on their official insignia/coat of arms write those 4S very similar in style to those Byzantine 4V and most Serbs don't even know why. The only difference is that Serbia used typical Slavic red and white colours.


It is common for Serbian nationalist hooligans to make this cross as graphiti but don't you dare to tell them that originally it is not Serbian. Example:

As for foundations I guess it depends on where you draw the line at what is considered a foundation. Fairly subjective as with many things. This formalised the parliamentary system and set a precedent for limiting monarchic power which steadily evolved through many subsequent acts to expand parliamentary powers, plus a couple of revolutions to Chartism and eventually universal suffrage. Many modern historians in the Anglosphere anyway trace modern Parliamentary democracy to Magna Carter and the Charter of the Forest but other nations will of course find roots elsewhere.

270,"&gt; Yea dictatorships can be modernising. They are still dictatorships though. China and Singapore have been great modernisers. Terrible oppressors too. 

Only if character of the state was not related to if it was autocratic or not when considering what we were talking about...

&gt; You tried to whitewash Kemalism as if it was some kind of progressive ideology while in fact it was nationalist, authoritarian and disciminatory to the core. That's why we talk about these things.

I do not whitewash anything, lol. You're making up things though and jumping from this to that. What you call Kemalism is not Kemalism and you're accusing the Kemalism with things what Mustafa Kemal himself did the opposite...

It was a pragmatist modernising nationalist Jacobin like action, and ideology only by the limited meaning of it as it lacked a doctrine and guy himself wanted to not have a lasting doctrine.

&gt; Durkheim never advocated for dictatorships that obliterate the diversity of the land through racist taxes, cultural extermination and the banning of political opponents. 

Only Gokalp hadn't advocated for such taxes either or banning political opponents or cultural extermination, lmao.

&gt; It is true that racism for normal at the time. That doesn't excuse it. If we critisize pan-Germanist ideas for being stupidly racist we must critisize all those Turkish mumbo jumbo about ""race competency"". 

I'm referring to what the thesis was, and why it appeared and how it wasn't an ideology but a thesis that happened due to trying to show that Anatolia belonging Turks and Turks being not incompetible with modernisation via then scientific understanding. It is again, not an ideology but some lame thesis and not racist but something trying to find a basis within that time's scientific notions. That has nothing to do with pan-Germanism

Rest is irrelevant so I'm moving on.

&gt; Not all Turkish citizens were treated the same. Minorities suffered enormously. Kurds up untill recently were not even recognised and they were called ""mountain Turks"".

Again, how this is relevant to Greek citizens being given rights to settle in Turkey with the same rights as Turkish citizens lmao. You're jumping topics...

&gt; I am talking about Kemalism in general.

536,"&gt;They actually have an air force. Armenia bought a few very capable Russian jets for example.

Nothing Turkish airforce can't handle in a day, so not really a need for S-400.

&gt;It looks like the south didn't learn from it's mistakes.

While I agree with you and I and a lot of people don't like those things it's not like the other side doesn't do/did similar stuff. Both sides have fascist and nationalists and do provocative stuff.

&gt;That's why the south refused to reunify with the Kofi Annan plan?

No, because it was a shitty plan and very unfavourable for us (if you read the wiki page and try to be a bit objective you will see why). We rejected that specific plan not reunification itself.

&gt;I'm not quite sure about that. During 1960-1974 Turkey had to intervene multiple times until the invasion finally stopped the conflict.

The 60s and 70s are not comparable to now. First of all, Greece-Turkey power balance was much different back then and thankfully nowadays we and Greece don't have fascist dictatorships. Also, some of the idiotic coupists back then thought Turkey wouldn’t invade (or if we follow the other theory they were just following the plan and hoped for the invasion). Now, if we attack ""TRNC"" we will be attacking the Turkish army that is stationed here directly. Going one-on-one versus Turkey is not an option for us, that's why we always rely on diplomacy and we basically have no airforce or navy.",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/o09dcz/modernizing_nato_requires_dealing_with_turkey/h1wf1ag/,BitVectorR,1623794914

590,"Your links pretty much supported my claims thank you.

Yes I didn't list all opressive measure, but I will said there were more.

I just pointed to those that you falsified. Instead of Danish being forbidden at home, the hardest measure was it being forbidden in school

Instead of people loosing their house, we had the government buying up land and giving it to Germans.

Also the expulsion they danes didn't lose their property.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Danes that did not swear oath to the Keiser was fired.

Oh no, they refuse to take the oath public servant had to take. Guess what happen in modern day Denmark or Germany?

Guess what in modern Germany the Danish politican(in Germany) are taking the Oath for all people they are representing, not only the Danish.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Villages told everyone would be deported if the children that had been   
sent to Danish schools did not return (way to avoid conscription).

Danish citizens were not conscripted, that what your article states. 

So that addition is wrong. It was to give them a danish education that was outlaw the German Empire.

&gt;Politicians that wanted the referendum was banned from carrying out the   
political job they had been democratically elected to hold.

? Where do get this from the text. 

&gt;Schoolteachers, priests, police that continued to speak Danish in public were fired.

False and correct at the same time. Yes School and admistrative language was German. Except for the schools 4 hours a week. If teacher  taught Danish they were fired. Policemen were also fired if they didn't use the administrative language.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Køller policy (no idea what it is called in German) was a ban on   
Danes meeting in public, imprisonment, deportations, people denied the   
right to be parents and their children taken from them. The objective   
was quite clear. Be Germans or be gone.

? That text doesn't support all of that.

The deportation of Danish citizens yes. The children being taken away yes, even though the text notes that was often overruled by higher Germany courts. 

Also the fight against Danish association. But not the imprisonment(though it happen but mostly on semi-legal charge like insulting the German Monarch) is not stated by your text. Also the ban on Danes meeting in public. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also the text also has dates. So your 56 years of Oppression is completly false.

Especially those ones started in 1898 and were already toned down in 1901.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean you post this wonderful text and start twisting again. No you were false in your beginning statement. I did also some mistakes, especially with the Geographic names, as I used historic definitions or didn't concede that other uses were also right.

I also a bit suprised that you are so adamant about, how horrible it was. 

Yes it was horrible but nothing really new. We can talk about how Denmark treated Greenland and make the parallels. Only that was after WW2.

Countries oppressing minorities is nothing new. I could  even go current Danish politics and point that out.  Only Danish in Schools in Denmark, everybody not behind the Danish State should deported. That are current political talking points.

The next morning, brave soldiers walked up onto no man's land and brokered informal truces with their foes. Among it all, many squadrons played football. One account describes a match between a Highland regiment and a Saxon one, they would laugh whenever one of the Scotsman's kilts flew up.

These truces lasted all the way until Christmas eve in some cases, with people sharing gifts with each other that were sent from their families at home. In the end, it was artillery which brought the war back on as the higher ups couldn't let them stop fighting.

This gives both sides a lever to use against each other, but considering Russia is dependent on gas exports, the EU has the longer part of that lever. 

What did change with NS2 is the ability of Ukraine to stop gas supplies to Western Europe. They had this ability as a leverage against both Russia and the EU, and now it's gone. 

So, how exactly is removing Ukrainian leverage over the West is a geopolitical defeat for the West? This is nonsensical.

But you can't convince me really because I'm not a city girl, I come from a village too, and I have seen how the shepherds tend to their sheep and their goats and the villagers to their chicken, and if you ask me, they live their lives just fine. 

Those goats for example come in to the pens, only when they want to, otherwise they're up and down the mountains all day. They trust their owner because he brings food for them, they've learned he feeds them, he waters them, so they go to him when he calls.... but sometimes they might just not come back but end up in my cooking pot instead ;)

However if you ask me, those goats live better lives than we do, not a care in the world, no fear of predators, free roaming, free grazing, and more food and water back into the pens anyway, what else could they want? I think this kind of life is natural for them as it can be, just in the end, just like nature, the predator gets them and we are that predator.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/o05dz2/european_parliament_overwhelmingly_backs_ban_on/h1v0nad/,gataki96,1623773040

Yes, the summit is not going to change the fundamental adversarial relationship between the two countries, and Russia is not going to do a U turn on what they consider their core national interests. 

Why would they, just because Biden graced them with his presence? Are there such expectations in Moscow? Come on.

However, the current relationship is one of unconstrained competition. There are no rules of the game, and both sides are taking shots that are available to them.

Since, but all accounts, the US is looking to deal with China, an actual challenger to their position as the top dog, having such no holds barred fight with Russia is not in their best interests, nor in Russian best interests. It's ultimately a destructive spiral. 

So, while the summit won't turn the two sides friendly, it'll hopefully do something to constrain the competition between the two. 

This idea jades the ideology purists on the American side, as they correctly recognize that arriving at common rules of the game does mean treating the other side's grievances with as legitimate. This is unacceptable to them, as they still cling to the complete dominance they  used to have.

887,"The EU has excluded 10 of the heaviest-hitting banks in the debt market from running lucrative bond sales as part of its €800bn recovery fund, over historic breaches of antitrust rules.

Brussels’ biggest ever borrowing spree kicked off on Tuesday with the sale of a new 10-year bond to fund the NextGenerationEU programme under a so-called syndication, where a group of banks is paid to drum up demand from investors. 

But 10, including big players such as JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Barclays, have been told they cannot take part in these deals due to previous involvement in market-rigging scandals, according to people familiar with the matter.

Banks found to have breached EU competition rules “will not be invited to tender for individual syndicated transactions”, said a spokesman for the European Commission, which handles debt issuance on behalf of the EU. “The Commission implements a strict approach to ensuring that the entities with whom it works are fit to be a counterparty of the EU.”

Banks found guilty of antitrust breaches will be required to show they have taken “remedial measures” to prevent them happening again before they will be allowed to bid for syndications, the spokesman added.

Bank of America, Natixis, Nomura, NatWest and UniCredit have been prevented from taking part due to a Commission antitrust ruling last month that they participated in a bond trading cartel during the eurozone debt crisis a decade ago.

Citigroup, JPMorgan and Barclays — in addition to NatWest — have also been barred due to a finding two years ago that they were involved in manipulating currency markets between 2007 and 2013, people familiar with the matter said. Deutsche Bank and Crédit Agricole are also excluded due to an April ruling that they were involved in a different bond trading cartel, the people said. All the banks declined to comment.

The list includes seven of the 10 largest banks by volume of European government and supranational debt sold so far this year, according to figures from Dealogic.

The 10 banks barred from the syndications are among a list of 39 so-called “primary dealers” — banks that have a responsibility to bid for bonds during regular debt auctions, which the EU will begin in September. This responsibility can sometimes prove costly, however, so investment banks typically regard the fees they earn from syndications as a sweetener for taking on primary dealer status.

“There’s a delicate equilibrium in the relationship between issuers and primary dealers, and this risks upsetting that,” said a senior banker at one of the lenders barred from syndicated deals. “These issues they are bringing up are from a long time ago, and they have been settled.”

The banks working on Tuesday’s inaugural recovery fund bond were BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, Morgan Stanley, Danske Bank and Santander. Investors placed more than €140bn of orders for the €20bn of debt, according to the Commission.

The recovery fund, which was agreed by EU member states last year, is set to transform Brussels into one of the region’s biggest borrowers.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/o0i2kk/eu_freezes_10_banks_out_of_bond_sales_over/h1v2bt1/,Charles_Snippy,1623773800

Several countries were already in negotiations, but those negotations were halted because the EU was going to handle this. The result: UK and US far outpaced the EU and started earlier, because they got their vaccines earlier, because they made the deal far faster. 

By now that there are plenty vaccines the EU manages to deliver, but we had to wait for the UK and the US to get theirs first, since they made the deal way faster.

&gt;  
&gt;That “easily”. NATO isn’t Turkey’s social benefits office.

Bunch of nonsense in one comment.

When did Turkey go to war with a fellow NATO member? If you mean South Cyprus, they were not member of NATO nor EU.

Turkey did not Shell Americans in Syria. A shell fell nearby (200 meters) away from an American base. Media sensationalized this event. Turkey always notifies Americans when she engages terrorists in Syria.

Turkey invaded Afrin to remove terrorist elements from Afrin in which she was very successful. No more PKK in Afrin and no more terrorist attacks in the region of Hatay thanks to this anti-terror operation. The number of people fled Afrin is nowhere near 170.000 but I guess people like to exaggerate.

Turkey rightfully downed a Russian Su-24, because Russia challenged Turkey many times by flying inside of Turkish airspace by bombing Turkish backed Turkmen rebels inside Syria. Since then Russia does not dare to fly into Turkish airspace. And guess what happened some members of NATO actually backed Russia instead of Turkey with their words.

Previously bought the HQ9 from China, but dropped after Americans promised to deliver the patriot systems with tech transfer. After delay and delay it was blocked by the congress. In 2016-2017 Americans pulled back the patriots, Turkey was left without any defense. After refusing to sell a system, supporting and arming the PKK inside Syria and pulling back the patriots was the last straw. Turkey had indeed bought the S400.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/o09dcz/modernizing_nato_requires_dealing_with_turkey/h1ukmvd/,BlackEagIe,1623765804

&gt;fun fact ICJ ruled that the independence of kosova didnt break any laws.

Fun fact, the ICJs ""ruling"" on that is basically a non statement, because the west supports Kosovo's separation. 

It cites, since the announcement of Kosovo's self proclaimed independence didn't come from [UNMIK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Interim_Administration_Mission_in_Kosovo) or [PISG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Institutions_of_Self-Government), who were the only mutually recognized administrations of Kosovo as per the 1244 resolution, but by ""representatives of the people of Kosovo"" - they were coincidentally not bound by those documents. 

ICJ basically said, 1244 doesn't apply to any Kosovo Albanian and that's fine. 

ICJ also stated that the declaration of independence didn't violate 1244 which is laughable since one of 1244's features is: "" *Reaffirm the commitment of UN member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States of the region..* "".

In essence it was a handy workaround which avoided then current international agreements and resolutions, completely disregarding interests of the Serbian people living there, resulting in what is today a internationally semi-recognized state* of Kosovo.",,/r/europe/comments/o05oth/15_june_1389_battle_of_kosovo_takes_place_the/h1ul2fe/,AddictedToMechanics,1623766010

963,"A piece of breaking news appeared on various popular Chinese-language websites on June 7 claiming that the Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi had admitted that the COVID-19 pandemic had originated in Italy in a virtual interview by Radiotelevi-sione Italiana (RAI). The Chinese reports claimed that Italy had mistaken COVID outbreaks in Milan, Genoa, and Venice in the summer of 2019 for influenza. This soon was exposed as fake news. The Italian embassy in Beijing issued a statement that afternoon, saying that “The Italian Embassy strongly emphasizes that the content of the article concerning the Prime Minister’s remarks is a complete lie and that the information has no basis whatsoever.”

This happened shortly after Italy’s recent veto of Beijing’s attempted takeover of LPE, a Milan-based semiconductor manufacturer, on March 31.

There is no way of knowing if the fake COVID-19 origins report was Beijing’s retaliation for the aborted deal but it certainly didn’t ease tensions between the two countries.

Expert: 5 Reasons Italy Is Cooling Its Relationship with China

Italy’s blocking of the Chinese acquisition was an abrupt change in course for the European nation that had been growing a close relationship with the Chinese regime in Beijing.

In 2019, Italy under the leadership of former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, became the first G7 country to embrace China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), against the advice of the United States and other G7 members.

In 2020 when the pandemic hit, Italy was the most impacted country in Europe. China donated 31 tons of personal protective equipment and virus testing kits to Italy in March 2020, as well as a dozen medical experts to support the health response.

Italy had also been one of the most pro-China EU members in recent decades. Between 2000 and 2019, Italy received 15.9 billion euros ($19.25 billion) in Chinese investments, making it Europe’s third biggest beneficiary. Recent financial troubles saw numerous China-based companies acquire a number of Italian businesses. As of 2020, more than 400 Chinese groups held stakes in 760 Italian companies across “highly profitable or strategic sectors.”

One of the best-known acquisitions was that of the AC Milan football club for 740 million euros ($788 million), previously owned by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

 But the change in approach to China didn’t surprise experts like Cheng Chin-mo, director at the Department of Diplomacy and International Relations of the Tamkang University in Taiwan. “This demonstrates the unravelling of China’s diplomacy in Europe,” Cheng told The Epoch Times. “There are five reasons why this is bound to happen.”

Although China’s “mask diplomacy” strategy helped ease some immediate supply shortages for Italy, the country can’t forget that China’s cover up of its coronavirus breakout caused the catastrophe in the first place, Cheng said. Italians have seen four million COVID-19 infections, and almost 127,000 deaths from the disease caused by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus. The pandemic was devastating for Italy’s already struggling economy, causing a 13 percent drop in per capita income in 2020 while the economy contracted by almost 11 percent. Free facial masks are just not enough to clear the clouds, Cheng said.

Secondly, China has made itself with a bad reputation in business ethics and conduct over the past decade, Cheng said, adding that Chinese businesses and investors are known for violating local regulations and agreements, which deeply upsets Europeans who value integrity.

“Chinese money was enthusiastically welcomed in Italy when the BRI MoU was signed in 2019. But the country has since found no material benefit from the collaborations,” he added. “On the contrary, some century old Italian businesses have turned for the worse or even went bankrupt after they started partnering with China.”

Thirdly, China’s “wolf warrior diplomacy” has turned many former fans off, Cheng said. In response to the EU’s sanctions in March over the regime’s genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the sanctions were based on “nothing but lies and disinformation.” It asked Brussels to “reflect on itself [and] face squarely the severity of its mistake” and stop “interfering in [China’s’] internal affairs.”

Draghi’s political position is the fourth factor, Cheng said. Draghi, who holds a very friendly attitude towards the United States and the EU, described his foreign policy as “strongly pro-European and Atlanticist, in line with Italy’s historical anchors.” Contrary to his predecessor, Draghi, who was elected in February, has shown clear determination to seek alliance with the United States. Shortly after his appointment, Draghi reaffirmed Rome’s membership in NATO and the historic friendship between Italy and the United States. The vetoing of the LPE deal is seen as a signal of the new administration’s focus on stemming Beijing’s political and economic influence in Italy, Cheng said.

Lastly, Cheng pointed to the global environment, which is turning against China. The U.S.-led international effort to curb communist China’s global expansion and human rights abuses, as well as the investigation in China’s role in the outbreak of the pandemic, have encouraged G7 countries to openly speak and act against the CCP’s atrocities, which they had avoided for many years fearing hurt to their business relationship with China. Meanwhile, Europe is growing much more wary of the threat the CCP’s poses to nation’s security after the CCP’s infiltration tools such as Huawei and the Confucius Institute were exposed.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/o0f5mh/italy_is_turning_away_from_the_chinese_communist/h1ul3qx/,Massimo24ore,1623766028

Don't seem to particularly get smarter as they age though.

I'm not against all meat production - there are many areas which are only good for grazing and in an ideal situation the moral argument against it is weak. There will be grazing animals there - either farmed or wild and unless you have a ""natural"" ecosystem like yellowstone - animal numbers have to be managed - nature ""manages"" grazing numbers without any regard to cruelty.

Baltic states is not some natural geographic area...

Official by whom? There is no such thing as ""official regions""...

&gt;Everyone got some vikings back then, Lithuania too.

Lithuania too?

&gt;Does that make us Nordic?

Not by the least. Lithuanians aren't a historically maritime nation even.

&gt;Parts of our country belonged to Germany for centuries

Parts. Those parts that didn't define the Lithuanian nation.

&gt;We are sharing culture with Sweden

Except that you are not. You are a traditionally Catholic country with more cultural ties to Poland.

&gt;You obviously want to be seen as Nordic but nobody sees you that way.

That's not the subject of this argument. Wanting to be somewhere is a subjective opinion, being somewhere is a question of fact, which interests me far more.

&gt;You still haven't said who sees you as Nordic. 

Those who know a thing or two about Estonia. People who are willing to let go their ignorant negative stereotypes.

&gt;Baltic states are similar to Nordic countries

Estonia and Latvia are, Lithuania is not.

&gt;it's a geographical and cultural region too.

1286,"&gt;I don't see how I am bashing the UK? British people really have some kind of complex where they see themselves as embattled wherever they go. I just disagreed with your examples.

I'm sorry but as both a European with citizenship in the EU and a British person I can safely say that UK bashing is pretty rife on reddit and on this sub in particular. You can try it for yourself... go post a positive piece of news about the UK on here or /r/worldnews and see what the comments are. It's really not a complex, I mean fuck look at some of the comments on this post alone.

In fact this comment thread was started because someone criticised the UK for having more than one soccer team, in a main post where Macron is speaking about the UK? It's not relevant, so why would that poster bring that up at all if not to needlessly criticise the UK?

And before you say, you're British you're biased it's in your head. Go look through some of my previous comments. I am usually fairly neutral about the UK's actions and frequently critical of the UK government.

All I did was point out lots of countries have multiple teams recognised by FIFA.

You then responded with  a short statement where you were quite blunt and said ""terrible example"". Now I presume English is your second language so sorry for not giving you the benefit of the doubt beforehand,  but generally in written English if you are that direct it can be perceived as combative. If you did not mean to come off that way, I apologise for taking offence, but in future would recommend you say something along the lines of ""I don't think the Netherlands is a good example, for XYZ reasons"" this will come across as far more neutral, which is obviously how you intended it to be.

Thanks for the info about the Netherlands, it's good to get insight from a Dutch person about how the Netherlands works.

1352,"&gt; No. I mean the system he brought upon his republic. A dictatorship with a militarist guard to safeguard his ideals (hence the plethora of coup attempts by Kemalists over the years) and all this followed by a set up two-party system with an introduced controlled opposition. Over the years the opposition broke free but the state remains deeply troubled by those early foundations.

Only if Mustafa Kemal wasn't a pragmatist moderniser that hadn't set up any militarist guardship ideology and no coups but 1960 had been Kemalist. Two party system also hadn't introduced by Kemalism or anything but due to letting free elections due to Western bloc alliance 

&gt; Thankfully his ""masterpiece"" called ""The Principles of Turkism"" is still there for people to read. A deeply racist piece of work that defines non-Turks as something that keeps anything Turkic behind. It was ""thanks"" to this racist work that Ottoman music was once banned in Turkey (during Kemalist rule) because it was found to be based on Byzantine music and that made it non-Turkish enough.

Not sure if we read the same book. Again, he was not a racist or a scientific racist but a typical moderniser nationalist a la Durkheim.

And it's comical to assume that alaturca music was banned due to Byzantine base. It was banned for the sake of modernisation and Westernisation. Western classical music was promoted instead for some time, up until Mustafa Kemal himself was confronted by singers on himself liking classical Ottoman music. 

&gt; These pseudoscientific hypothesis as parts of a bigger ideology. Similar to pan-Germanist or pan-Slavic ideologies and their counterparts about origins of their ""race"".

No, it was not. It was an attempt to try to claim Turks weren't an inferior race and able to progress and Anatolia was theirs as they were Hittites.

&gt; Yea but sadly his goons lived on to enact such policies. 

Yeah policies of his enabling every Greek citizen is so comptable with taxing minorities. Come on...

&gt; How are policies enacted by Kemalist politicians related to Kemalism? Seriously?

1432,"Battle of Kosovo, also spelled Kossovo, (June 15, Old Style, 1389), was fought at Kosovo Polje (""Field of the Blackbirds""; now in Kosovo) between the armies of the Serbian prince Lazar and the Turkish forces of the Ottoman sultan Murad I (reigned 1360–89) that left both leaders killed and ended in a Turkish victory, the collapse of Serbia, and the complete encirclement of the crumbling Byzantine Empire by Turkish armies.

Under Sultan Murad’s rule the Turks had been expanding their rule from Anatolia into the Balkans, where the Serb Empire was potentially their strongest opponent. At the Battle of Maritsa in 1371 the Serbs suffered a severe defeat that fragmented their empire into rival princedoms.  
  
Murad resumed his campaigns against the Serbs in the 1380s. In the summer of 1389 he halted at Kosovo, from where he had options to attack Serbia or Macedonia. While Murad consulted with his commanders, Lazar mustered all his forces in alliance with Vuk Branković, a Serbian noble, and advanced on Kosovo. Prince Lazar was the ruler of Moravian Serbia and the most powerful among the Serbian regional lords of the time, while Branković ruled the District of Branković and other areas, recognizing Lazar as his overlord.

Lazar’s army is thought to have been less than half the size of Murad’s force. The battle began with Ottoman archers bombarding the advancing Serbian cavalry, which blunted their impact on the Turkish lines. However, inroads had been made and the Serbian charge was followed up by heavily armored knights. Fearing that the Serbians might break through, the Turks counterattacked, routing the Serbian infantry.  
  
Some records claim that Lazar was captured and executed; others claim that he was deserted by the jealous Brankovi? and fought valiantly until hacked to death. Murad is thought to have been killed by a Serbian knight, Miloš Obilić, in the immediate aftermath of the battle. 

Although the Ottomans managed to annihilate the Serbian army, they also suffered huge casualties that delayed their progress. The Serbs were left with too few men to effectively defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Consequently, the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals became so consecutively in the following years.

The Battle of Kosovo is particularly important to Serbian history, tradition and national identity.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/o05oth/15_june_1389_battle_of_kosovo_takes_place_the/h1tcaq1/,capcaunul,1623731731

They also indoctrinated children, Young Pioneers, Hitler Youth, so that the children would believe whatever their government wanted them to believe.

They also took the time to commit genocide in neighbouring Laos and bomb the shit out of Cambodia. They then ditched Vietnam after losing leaving hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians dead and a few hours later the communists walked into Saigon and took over the country. America did all that in he name of freedom and democracy 🤨 so it's strange that people there hated the US and like their ""evil"" communist government 🤔.

Daniel R. Lucey, spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America on January 20th:

Yale Medical School, on January 23rd: ""Two weeks ago, we didn't even know what the nCOV2019 virus was. Today, thanks to China’s quick public release of the initial nCOV2019 virus genome, there are now 18 genomes connected to nCOV2019 that are being shared and studied by scientists around the world.

25 national and international experts from China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore, the United States of America and the World Health
Organization, on February 24th: “In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. The strategy
that underpinned this containment effort was initially a national approach that promoted universal temperature monitoring, masking, and hand washing. However, as the outbreak evolved, and knowledge was gained, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor implementation. Specific containment measures were adjusted to the provincial, county and even community context, the capacity of the setting, and the nature of novel Coronavirus transmission there.”

They have the largest bat corona virus collection in the world, and we know they were doing gain of function research. We also know the US was funding this lab, and sent diplomats to inspect the site several years before the outbreak. The inspectors were appalled at the lack of proper safety measures doing this type of dangerous research, and there are actual diplomatic cables that exist from that time that were sent back to the US warning of the bad conditions in the lab and that it wasn't safe etc. Also, the narrative that this was animal to human transmission started early on by several large prestigious labs... that were involved in the funding of these projects at Wuhan and doing their own gain of function research. They had a ton of incentive to push the animal to human transmission idea, as the likely lab leak would have ruined their whole life's work and got all their funding cut, as well as putting them in the spotlight for funding research that was going to kill millions of people.

1755,"&gt; Sure, but the UK has fairly firmly rejected that as an option by leaving the EU. The point there being that the UK is actively intending not to sit within the EU formally as a member, or in the EU's sphere as an economy tied into an EU regulatory framework. Obviously the EU would have preferred the UK not to leave and failing that to remain very closely attached to the EU, but that doesn't fit with the UK's aims, hence the position the UK and EU are in now.

Yes. So, it's clear that the UK's demands are causing this problem, and it's consequently only logical that those problems are solved at by the UK's effort.

&gt;Sure, but the UK is also well within its rights to reject that as being excessive. It doesn't get rid of the issues that face the UK and EU in Ireland/NI. The whole point there with the NIP, WA and the TCA was to avoid a problematic outcome for both the UK and Ireland, the UK clearly intends to ensure that that outcome is met.

Prior to 2017, we didn't even have any non-Baltic NATO troops in the Baltics. The situation has since improved but we're still struggling to make ourselves heard and to be taken seriously by the allies, as is the case with the conversion of the peacetime NATO air policing mission that we've been asking to also take on wartime roles but it doesn't appear to be willing to.

It mostly relies on self-declaration and self-reporting, with state officials making surprise visits from time to time.

The companies have a shitload of ways at their disposal to basically render any actual analysis impossible. They can pretext various technical issues not to let the officials access critical locations, they can sometime act on water levels to get out of the control protocols range, making the analysis void, or they can make everything take so much time that the officials can't control half of what they're supposed to control.  
Of course these methods can be reported to the competent authority, which means they'll probably sit on a desk for a number of months before being thrown out because, as stated before, these agency are usually critically understaffed (and anyway these companies usually have the support or more-or-less local politicians who will move heaven and earth to make sure such reports — which do not even contain anything really incriminatory — don't have any actual consequence).",,/r/europe/comments/nzne9m/illegal_sewage_discharge_in_english_rivers_10/h1row97/,russicola,1623701393

1980,"Building more road access from outside the town is unlikely to help. Induced demand is a bitch, and building more roads almost always results in more traffic rather than less. Sometimes it helps the situation for a few years, but then results in *even worse* congestion ten years later.

Expanding public transit is usually a better solution. We used to have a road in Copenhagen that was always clogged with cars. Three lanes in each direction. Then the middle lanes were turned into a bus road, and it actually reduced the congestion and made traffic flow better despite there being less space for cars. One, the cars no longer had to share lanes with buses that kept starting and stopping - and two, since there were more people using the bus, there were fewer cars on the road.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/nzjh1a/coimbra_university_me_watercolor_42x56cm/h1r9t4q/,wasmic,1623694549

That's what Unionists say. Nationalists say that Northern Ireland won't be able to trade with either.

At the moment everyone is chill because food, labor and safety regulations haven't diverged, but once they do:

- If GB relaxes regulations in order to trade with the US and Asia-Pacific, Northern Ireland will not be able to stay competitive within the UK. Sure, they will technically be able to export to Britain, but nobody will buy their products, if they can get cheaper ones elsewhere.

- If GB tightens up regulations, Northern Ireland will have to invest money in adhering to them, and will not be able to compete with cheaper products from RoI, which will kill export to the EU.

Remember that taking back the control was the main point of Brexit. Regulations and standards will change and diverge. NI will have to pick one side eventually.

Moreover, think about imports: they're not allowed to simply just import products from GB anymore. It's much simpler to import from the EU.

2039,"Lets cover poland first, because thats easier. 

Poland did receive reparations in different ways.

1. big parts of germany which in itself should be enough
2. the reparations that the soviets collected to be redistributed among their controlled territory -&gt; to be fair soviets didn't distribute those, but thats not the fault of germany
3. continued payments even to today to survivers who are or have been polish jews
4. There have been some smaller single payments if i remember correctly, but i maybe wrong here

Compared to other nations poland got the most reparations already alone by point 1. They also withdraw claims multiple times. Lets also not forget germany would've never agreed to pay other countries money for being in the EU if they also have to pay heavy reparations. Yes, EU money are no reparations, but dont fool yourself. There would be no EU money if germany had to pay the kind of reparations poland and greece demand.

Reparations need to be agreed and enforced at a reasonable time. These demands only hurt those who never commited those crimes and mostly dont help those who had been the direct victims.

Last point which also includes greece in some way. If germany had to pay everyone the amount of damage they caused. nobody would get anything, because germany couldn't pay that. In a way poland received already more than they would've gotten if every nation persisted over their claims.

\*\*\*\*

greece is a different matter and i hope my english skills are good enough to get the point across that i have in mind. They were hit hard too, and received some payments which I'am sure are just a droplet of the actual damage that has been caused. 

most arguments basically come back to the points i already pointed out with poland minus the 4 initial points. Especially the one over EU money. 

I would probably agree that morally speaking germany had to pay more to greece back in the day. By what i mean is shortly after the war. The problem is though, greece hasn't had the backup by the allies to enforce those in a timely manner, because quite frankly and i know i may sound like a dick here, they arent the victors of this war, just like poland wasn't, or other minior nations in that world war. USA, GB and Soviets are. Without those, there wouldn't be a victory to celebrate. 

Further more germany was heavily destroyed and looted by all. There wasn't much to get after USA, France and Soviets were done. If there had been an sensible agreement back then, yes germany should honor it. But there is none. And the more time passes by, the more, as a german, i am unwilling to pay. People don't like to get punished when they have done absolutely nothing wrong. My parents had been born after the war, i was born shortly before reunification. All these talks about these high number of reparations just accomplish one thing. It punishes the wrong people and creates distrust even hate. I would never vote for AfD under normal circumstances, but that would probably change, if germany had to pay those sums now.

It's great for the EU obviously, but not for anyone else, which is presumably why the EU is having major issues pushing that idea and starting to see existing structures fall away and not replace by something similar.

2113,"The mayor of Portugal's capital, Lisbon, has come under fire after admitting that officials handed over the personal data of organisers of an anti-Kremlin demonstration to the Russian embassy in Lisbon.

They include Russian activist, Pavel Eliazarov, who has submitted a formal complaint to the authorities.

The activists arranged a protest outside the Russian embassy in Lisbon in support of detained Russian dissident Alexei Navalny in January.

Eliazarov said: ""As a refugee, I felt protected by the Portuguese State. I even had international protection. For example, when I travel, I know that if anything happens, if they put my name on the Interpol list, Portugal will protect me. And at the same time, they send my personal data, like my address to Russia. I feel less secure, now.""

Lisbon Mayor Fernando Medina apologised for what he said was an “unfortunate mistake” which he blamed on the municipal chamber's workers.

**Lisbon Mayor: 'Mistake due to bureaucracy'**

""The mistake was due to the bureaucracy of the services that applied to this protest the same protocols as for scores of other protests that take place in the municipality,'' Medina said.

Under Portuguese law the organisers of such protests must provide the local authorities with their personal details, including address and contact information.

In a statement, his office acknowledged the breach of data protection rules but said that it `""vehemently rejects any accusations and insinuations of complicity with the Russian regime.''

The latest development comes at a sensitive time for the opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Navalny, Putin's most ardent political foe, was arrested in January and given a 2 1/2-year prison term for violating the terms of a past sentence for embezzlement; which he dismissed as politically motivated.

It is not the first time concerns have been raised over data being misused. Other campaign groups, including a group supporting Palestinians, had criticised the Lisbon municipal chamber in the past for also sharing potentially sensitive data ahead of previous protests.",,/r/europe/comments/nznhg5/lisbon_authorities_hand_data_of_antikremlin/h1qcdr9/,quixotic_cynic,1623679385

2115,"Turkey has long since abandoned the West. Its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has aligned his country with an axis of powers openly hostile to Western interests: China, Russia and Iran. This is his prerogative as a popular, elected leader.  
  
But Erdogan also craves the protection of the West’s military partnerships and membership in its economic associations. He wants Turkey to remain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization even as he buys weapons systems that undermine the alliance’s security and hurls insults at heads of member states. And he seeks “mutual trust” with the European Union even as he threatens to flood it with millions of migrants.  
  
  
The West should respond by demonstrating that its tolerance for Turkish truculence is at an end. The best forum to do so is NATO, where patience for Erdogan is already wearing thin. The alliance’s first summit since President Joe Biden’s swearing-in takes place next week, and he is scheduled to meet Erdogan on June 14.  
  
Erdogan has deployed especially bellicose oratory against the U.S. Such hostility was met with amused tolerance by President Donald Trump, who showed little interest in American leadership. Now that Biden has said he will resume that responsibility, he should make it clear to Erdogan that Turkey can’t have it both ways.

Biden has had plenty of opportunities to size Erdogan up over the years, and he has clearly concluded that the Turkish leader is an autocrat. Turkey, he has said, has “got to understand that we’re not going to continue to play with them the way we have.”

Turkey is already testing this assertion by ratcheting up the rhetoric. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has openly accused the U.S. of ordering a failed 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan, and claimed Europe was enthusiastic in its support. This goes well beyond previous accusations, some aired by Erdogan himself, that the U.S. had sided with the coup plotters.  
  
In fact, Biden was vice president at the time of the coup attempt, and flew to Turkey to assure Erdogan of American support. Although Ankara has conducted exhaustive investigations into the events, and arrested thousands of people, it has not provided a shred of evidence that the U.S. or Europe were in any way involved. Yet Erdogan hasn’t thought to correct his minister’s charges, much less chastise him.  
  
As for NATO, Turkey has brushed aside its repeated warnings against acquiring Russian missile-defense systems, and is in fact proposing to buy even more. It has ratcheted up disputes with alliance members Greece (over hydrocarbon exploration) and France (over the Libyan civil war). More recently, it used its membership to further Moscow’s agenda by insisting that NATO water down its criticism of Belarus for the forced landing of an airliner and seizure of a dissident on board.  
  
NATO’s founding charter doesn’t allow for members to be expelled, but Turkey can be told in various ways that it’s no longer wanted as a member. A good start would be to reduce the alliance’s footprint on Turkish soil, starting with the withdrawal of nuclear weapons and other strategic assets. The group can also coordinate punitive measures against Turkey, including the suspension of arms sales and economic sanctions. The European Union should underline the message by confirming it has no intention of reviving the long-stalled talks over Turkey’s accession.

Biden could back NATO with unilateral American measures. His administration has already indicated it may extend sanctions on Turkey’s defense industry and will uphold the country’s suspension from the F-35 fighter program. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said even tougher penalties would be considered. This would be welcomed by Congress, where a bipartisan consensus on punishing Turkey had been frustrated by Trump’s tendency to cut Erdogan ever more slack.

Keeping it that way may be the best for NATO as it gives a porous border to Russia in the Baltic with options for negotiations and brokerage... or it may be a bad thing to have a wildcard in 'the game'.

2224,"There are multiple solutions but the UK government doesn´t want to actually adopt any. The essential 3 positions are:

1) **follow EU food regulations in enough sectors that reduces the number of checks to a minimum.** The government doesn't want to do this because of multiple reasons, one because of losing face, two they wanted independence from the EU to pick and chose their food regulations (kind of having their cake and eating it, if there were no checks), third, making it more difficult to be competitive in Non-EU markets etc etc

&amp;#x200B;

2) **Actually enforce the sea based customs check.** The point of the solution agreed on by all parties was to not break the GFA by not creating a land border. Of course it does create a type of border which feels like a betrayal of the GFA by some, but at the end of the day everyone knew this was going to be one of the consequences of Brexit, but it was minimalised for whatever reason(s). The government by not enforcing it and unilaterally deciding to break it only a few months after agreeing upon it is doing this in, again, an attempt to 'have its cake and eat it'.

&amp;#x200B;

3) **Impose a land border control check between NI and Ireland.** This would be the 'cleanest' solution and would solve the sovereignty issues etc, but obviously because of the GFA it's simply not an option.

 So basically 3 options, but only 2 realistic. The english government chose the 2nd option when it made the agreement because it thought it was the best way to have total independence from the EU, and probably hoped that the consequences would be minor. 

Unfortunately there is no practical option where the UK can freely move goods to NI without complying with some EU regulations, and therefore what was obviously going to happen has happened. Basically they can't have their cake and eat it too.

Notice that this is coming from an englishman living in Portugal, I'm not a big fan of the EU as it is slowly becoming more federalist, but I also would have liked the UK to remain to try to keep a check on this tendency.",,/r/europe/comments/nzf1oc/macron_on_boris_johnson_and_the_northern_ireland/h1q066n/,Christian_314,1623672349

2250,"The situation of Northern Ireland is much different though from overseas territories of France or the Netherlands.

In my opinion, there's no other solution to the problem than a hard border between Northern Ireland and either Ireland or Great Britain. Hard border with Ireland might lead to a very nasty case of civil war. Hard border with Great Britain might cause Northern Ireland to unite with the Republic, especially considering the fact that it has a very simple, lawful path to do so. Which means, the UK is now in a situation with no way out, and the only sensible solution is to either stall and wait as long as possible until something unpredictable happens, or to cheat and keep both borders open.

Actually, stalling, arguing and waiting might not be a bad solution. As long as Northern Ireland doesn't become an entrypoint of toxic waste into the EU, nobody is willing to take steps that cannot be undone, such as economic sanctions on the UK. And that condition is unlikely to happen, because let's be realistic: the UK won't diverge from the EU regarding food and safety regulations, simply because neither country wants to put local population at risk.",,/r/europe/comments/nzf1oc/macron_on_boris_johnson_and_the_northern_ireland/h1q0jet/,ILoveOldFatHairyMen,1623672601

It is aimed at the visitors of Germany’s biggest and most famous red-light district, the Reeperbahn in Hamburg and is only shown there. Since you‘ll find live sex shows, sex shops, brothels and so called hour hotels (frequented by the prostitutes who offer their services on the streets), this poster is probably the tamest bit of advertising you‘ll find there. 

What, as a European, I found rather backwards and strange, was that we were told it’s forbidden for our toddlers (1.5 and 3 years at the time) to play on the beach naked. That was somewhere in one of the Carolinas.

Here, where I live in Bavaria, we have about 6 lakes within cycle distance. You will see naked pre-school kids everywhere. No one bats an eyelid. You will also see a lot of topless sunbathing. And one of the lakes is a designated nude bathing lake. All perfectly normal. Our saunas are textile-free (as it‘s called) and mostly mixed. If you’re a man you can only go to mixed ones, because the men only saunas are normally more for men who prefer other men as partners.

2480,"West Germany was part of the EU project from day 1, the coal and steel union, and retained a central position throughout its growth for it own benefit. Germany is in the EU today as they've always found it of useful to be part of it. More importantly, being a (the) key driver of the EU, since it grew out of the EEC et al, Germany has and does guide the EU to it's advantage with only France to act as a counter, to some extent at least. With the UK gone, the federal EU with Germany at it's head is inevitable.

You even accept the root of my argument; Germany keep the EU going as the EU is of benefit to them. Germany keeps them alive so it may use what remains. Now I need you to view Germany as the most economically powerful member state without a military (enter the EU, of which they largely control). All states need to protect their interests, have you never heard of geo-politics, of force projection, of areas of interest?! 

I'm not going into a hypothetical of what every military's interest an EU nation might want but it clear that, as with the money, the EU's military will be at the behest of the few EU states holding power, notably France and Germany; not say, Latvia and Denmark.

How do you know for sure that ""it will only be used for defense""? This to me is a very naïve claim to make.

Military's projections of power are usually economic and I see no reason why Germany/the EU would be any different. The populations may be passive, but would the economic interests of Germany allow their production or resource lines to be threatened? I suggest not, as no country would. The EU provides the perfect cover for this as their passive/pacifist population would accept, for example, a tank with an EU flag but not a German one rolling through foreign country.",,/r/europe/comments/nw40ts/the_eu_countries_that_trust_britain_the_least/h1pklwt/,Baldtastic,1623658503

Like the rest of the Barbary Coast, the Regency of Algiers lived from the trade of slaves or goods captured from Europe, America and sub-Saharan Africa. The European powers bombarded Algiers on different occasions in retaliation and the United States provoked the Barbary Wars in order to put an end to Algerian privateering against Christian shipping. 

The conquest of Algeria began in the last days of the Bourbon Restoration by Charles X of France. It aimed to put a definite end to Barbary privateering and increase the king's popularity among the French people, particularly in Paris, where many veterans of the Napoleonic Wars lived. Algerian slave trade and piracy immediately ceased after the French conquered Algiers.",,/r/europe/comments/nzh3qx/on_this_day_in_1830_thirtyfour_thousand_french/h1pkru9/,Winstonoceaniasmith,1623658668

Northern European countries, particularly the Nordic/Scandinavian countries, have a high life expectancy due to better economies, wealth and high levels of happiness and life satisfaction, despite having a less optimal diet compared to the Mediterranean diet of Southern Europe.

Southern European countries have an even higher life expectancy due to a better (Mediterranean) diet despite having worse economic conditions and lower levels of life satisfaction.

2554,"Sønderjylland was the original, Danish name of Schleswig. The name wasn't new. It had existed since the early Middle Ages. It is rather Schleswig which is a new name, at least in comparison with Sønderjylland. Present-day Northern Schleswig is more or less what would've been known as Barvidsyssel and Ellumsyssel in the Middle Ages, while Southern Schleswig was Istedsyssel. So Sønderjylland is very much a Danish province. It has been so since the dawn of times. Dannevirke was erected at the Schlei to defend it, a little north of the Eider, which had been the border of Denmark since time immemorial. Charlemagne also recognised the Eider as Denmark's border in 811.

Schleswig is old Danish territory. It was completely Danish in the Middle Ages, but slowly Germans began to immigrate. In 1864, there was still a Danish majority in the duchy as a whole and the northern parts of Southern Schleswig. [Here you can see a map of nationality in the Middle Ages, red being Danish and yellow being Frisian](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Bos%C3%A6tningsomr%C3%A5derSlesvig-HolstenDannevirke.png). [Here you can see the borders between Danish-speakers and German-speakers in Schleswig in 1840](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/SprogforholdSlesvig.png/800px-SprogforholdSlesvig.png). After the Second World War there was actually a majority for reunification with Denmark in Southern Schleswig again among the native population. However, there were a lot of East Prussian refugees in Southern Schleswig (so many that they outnumbered the native population), and these wanted to be German. This, among with some domestic factors in Denmark, meant that Southern Schleswig didn't return to Denmark.

It should also be said that Schleswig has been divided up many times before, partly by the complicated laws of succession in the duchy, partly by Denmark's enemies. In the 1600s and 1700s the wars between Denmark and Sweden revolved around the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp: a Swedish vassal state in Schleswig-Holstein.

and than your rebuttel for china taking hong kong is completely stupid. your basically saying that they should be forced to become china. 

I get your point that it was initially a colonial lease. and after they gave it back it should begiven back to china because they had te lease. 

But with this reasoning you pretend like in the time of the lease nothing in china chaged an that the same goverment is still active. Hong kong is a more west looking country than the authoritarian china.

2644,"Munich, German München, is the capital of Bavaria Land in southern Germany. It is Bavaria’s largest city and the third largest city in Germany (after Berlin and Hamburg) with approximately 1.5 million inhabitants, as well as the 11th-largest city in the European Union. The city's metropolitan region is home to 6 million people.  
Straddling the banks of the River Isar (a tributary of the Danube) north of the Bavarian Alps, it is the seat of the Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria, while being the most densely populated municipality in Germany (4,500 people per km^(2)). Munich lies about 50 km north of the edge of the Alps.

Munich, or München (“Home of the Monks”), traces its origins to the Benedictine monastery at Tegernsee, which was probably founded in 750 CE. In 1157 Henry the Lion, duke of Bavaria, granted the monks the right to establish a market where the road from Salzburg met the Isar River. A bridge was built across the Isar the following year, and the marketplace was fortified.  
In 1255 Munich became the home of the Wittelsbach family, which had succeeded to the duchy of Bavaria in 1180. For more than 700 years the Wittelsbachs would be closely connected with the town’s destiny.

The rule of the Wittelsbach dynasty finally ended with the self-imposed exile of Louis III in November 1918, and, in the aftermath of World War I, Munich became a hotbed of right-wing political ferment. It was in Munich that Adolf Hitler joined the Nazi Party and became its leader. The beer cellar where he held meetings that led to the Beer Hall Putsch (“rising”) against the Bavarian authorities in November 1923 can still be seen. In World War II Munich suffered heavily from Allied bombing raids, which destroyed more than 40 percent of its buildings.

Today, Munich is a global centre of art, science, technology, finance, publishing, culture, innovation, education, business, and tourism and enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey, and being rated the world's most liveable city by the Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Munich is considered an alpha-world city, as of 2015. 

It is one of the most prosperous and fastest growing cities in Germany.

Munich is home to centuries-old buildings and numerous museums. The city is known for its annual Oktoberfest celebration and its beer halls, including the famed Hofbräuhaus, founded in 1589. In the Altstadt (Old Town), central Marienplatz square contains landmarks such as Neo-Gothic Neues Rathaus (town hall), with a popular glockenspiel show that chimes and reenacts stories from the 16th century.",,/r/europe/comments/nzelnt/14_june_1158_the_city_of_munich_münchen_is/h1p5jhs/,Vucea,1623645683

2849,"&gt; Germany, you failed us, and I'll hold a grudge until you make it right.

Arguably Germany [contributed a little](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/history-energiewende) to the development of renewable energies. Now, how did the [carbon emissions in the power sector](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/co2-emission-intensity-8#tab-googlechartid_googlechartid_googlechartid_googlechartid_chart_11111) of the european union evolve over the past two decades? In 1999 it was 416 g/kWh and 20 years later in 2019 it was down to 255 g/kWh. How much of this reduction in the EU can we attribute to the deployment of new nuclear power, how much to the expansion of renewable energies?

Sure enough, Germany is failing in the climate perspective, but not because they abondoned nuclear (the whole world is doing that, share of nuclear power in the electricity has gone down globally), even France has reduced the share of nuclear power in their electricity mix (from more than 77% in 2000 to less than 68% in 2020). It's more that the government clinges to the established industries with big money interests in coal and diesel, just as Jota_Aemilius pointed out. Hold a grudge against Germany all you want, I hold mine against the conservative Merkel government that ruled the past 16 years with [anti-climate-action politics](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Germany-Neglects-Renewables-Set-to-Miss-2020-Climate-Goals.html) and it would be a good thing if they were driven out of power.

The science is this: Areva [failed to finish a single new commercial reactor in Europe](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/epr-nuclear-power-plant-delays/) since the Kyoto protocol up to now. They didn't help to displace any coal burning. [Scientific studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921003962) now luckily say, we don't need new nuclear power to reach our tightened climate goals anymore. Because if the past 20 years are any indication, hoping for new nuclear power to reduce carbon emissions by 2030 in europe is pretty futile.

You are mistaken if you think there would be any non-climate-denial party in the Bundestag that would go for nuclear power again. Thus, from a climate point of view the best that can happen is a Bundestag that speeds up low-carbon generator deployment and coal phase-out. Even if there were a political will to build new nuclear power, it would be bad for the climate, because that would mean that we delay action and carbon reductions for another decade or so.",,/r/europe/comments/nxag5h/how_a_green_germany_could_shake_europe/h1og3qj/,haraldkl,1623630153

I'm pretty sure I read an article about how a bunch of European countries have had their tourist numbers boom, but the tourists aren't spending much money in the countries. Instead they're just visiting because the flights are cheap, staying at a cheap airbnd, drinking cheap alcohol, and causing more problems to the country than good.

2875,"&gt;Not everyone wants to see women showing ankles. This falls into the same category.

Lmao, it so much doesn't. How can you compare those two things? It's socially acceptable for women to show ankles, but not for men to be bare chested in public. If you're a guy, go ahead, go out bare chested in the middle of the day and see how people react. It's not something what the vast majority would accept.

&gt;Right, but dangling a dead guy on a stick is peachy. Polish society needs to change, and in double time, because we can do better.

I don't want to further discuss this, because this (religion in Poland and how it's ruining Poland) is a topic for a completely new discussion.

&gt;I don't mind seeing naked body. Ergo, it's not true that nobody wants to see that.

Maybe you, but a lot of people do mind seeing that. If you go out naked you're an exhibitionist and you should be fined for that, because it's highly disrespectful, obnoxious, and completely disgusting. Think about children, would you want your children to see naked people in public?

We're not cavemen, we wear clothes for a reason.

&gt;We are equipped with incredibly aesthetic bodies. They need to be celebrated, and often are.

Incredibly aesthetic bodies? Who are you trying to deceive? Most of the people do not look extremely attractive, not everyone looks good enough to be on the cover of a magazine, and you make it sound like we all are. Get a grip.

&gt;Just go to any museum of classical art. I bet that you will see crowds admiring naked bodies, including dicks, butts, and vaginas. There is absolutely nothing wrong with those body parts.

The CDU/CSU, a conservative party and the biggest in Germany, most likely to win the next elections, the SPD social democrats that were in power for many years and are have been the minor coalition partner of the CDU/CSU for the past 12 they're more left wing but pretty moderate and the Green party which is comparable to the SPD (their failure has probably made the Green party as successful as it is now). They are comparable to the SPD but more focused on climate change. The 3rd party in current polls is the FDP (free market liberals).

Treaty of Ribe rings a bell. Danish King became Duke of Schleswig and Holstein. Due it having no sucessor. The German nobles had quite influence in it.

Please read a book about it.

&gt;A plebescite that was not dictated to the favor of Denmark or the borderwould have been further south as the ""winners"" of ww1 expected.

It's well known history.

&gt;Schleswig is Schleswig. Jutland is Jutland. South Jutland is present daySouth Jutland in Denmark or the historically North schleswig

Schleswig is modern terms today Germany Schleswig. It's still sometimes used for the parts of Denmark that part of the Duchy/North Schleswig. The Same Southern Jutland for Denmark.

Jutland is the penninsula.

&gt;Jutland, known anciently as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula, is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and part of northern Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively.

Sometimes it can also refer to only the Danish part.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/nypeli/a_german_revolutionary_map_from_1848_of_germany/h1nmu6u/,Salix166,1623614699

Gadjo on Roma violence does happen on occasion (it tends to make the news) but definitely not on the same scale. In multiple cities I have lived in, when there is a group of Roma in a public setting it's the Gadjo being wary and worried, not the other way around.

I have never assaulted a Roma and never would. I treat each person as an individual. But I sure have nothing to apologise for, when I have been the victim in all interactions I have had. I am not kneeling, you can if you have something to apologise for.

As for society as a whole, lots of money goes into integration and education for Roma families. Rightfully so.

3340,"Firstly, when Swedes conquered us, there was no country in Finland and Sweden itself wasn't a clear country. Finland becoming part of Sweden was more like a part of Sweden becoming a country with unifying diverse groups and lands, including Finland. You could say that Sweden developing as a country is inseparable from Finland becoming part of Sweden. 

This happened in Sweden too. They weren't yet ""Swedes"" when Finland became part of Sweden, but there were several tribes, Sveas, Geats and Gutes. Sveas and Geats saw themselves as separate people still when Finland was under Sweden.

And it's fair to note that during those times, they were not ""swedes"" that conquered, but *kings and their armies*. The Middle Ages in Northern Europe were times when small petty kingdoms started to arise, and these petty kings fought each other and each tried to be more powerful and get more area under control. Not like a nation state of Swedes conquering a nation of Finland.

Secondly, Sweden *never implemented feodal system here*. We never had feodalism here. Like 90% of the land in Finland was owned by Finnish peasants, not by foreign aristocracy, and we didn't have vassal states nor lords with their own armies serving the king like Game of Thrones has.

&gt;Also we have a ocean between heartland sweden 

During those times, seas connected, not separated. For example Hansa League was based on sea trade. And when Finland was part of Sweden, Finland was integral part of Sweden. Turku was the second largest city of Sweden and part of the ""heartland"" of the country. That's why the loss of Finland in 1809 had a profound effect on Sweden so they changed their constitution, changed their monarch dynasty and took a stance of neutrality that lasted 200 years. It wasn't that Sweden lost some ""remonte lands beyond the sea"" but Sweden lost an integral part of kingdom with one of their major cities and natural resources.

&gt;And I'd argue that the difference is that when the swedish speaking population does conscription or when they fought in WW2 they did so for protection of the local status quo and the lands they were living in, not to fight wars over northern German provinces or projecting power somewhere. 

Do you think Finnish speaking and Swedish speaking Swedes of that time had differing views of the war? Do you think Finns saw it as ""their war"" and Swedes as ""our war""? There was no modern sense of national identity back then, and during those times people thought more in the lines of ""war of our country"". For Finnish and Swedish military forces, it was pretty much the same: they were serving the king to project power.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/nypeli/a_german_revolutionary_map_from_1848_of_germany/h1mg569/,Toby_Forrester,1623593320

People connected those islands with small wooden bridges and gradually through the years started to fill up the in between space, making up one large island. (this goes centuries? back)

Even then and even with the embankments the island was filling up with water even close to the center of the island, the locals called it ""little Venice"".

The last filling from the state was in 1969.  
The south part of the island has shallow waters, it's easier to make embankments and has less problems, but the north which is deep has more difficulties building proper embankments that could hold for everything.

**While vehicles provide economic and societal benefits, they come with a sizeable carbon footprint. The European Green Deal is a chance for car manufacturers to make their processes more circular, write Maya Ben Dror and Tilmann Vahle.**

*Maya Ben Dror is the Lead on Shaping the Future of Mobility at the World Economic Forum. Tilmann Vahle is the Lead on Circular Mobility Solutions at SYSTEMIQ. Both authors are involved in the Circular Cars Initiative, a World Economic Forum project.*

The automotive industry is a driver of Europe’s economic value creation, competitive sovereignty, and societal wellbeing. But road transport is also responsible for 20% of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions, and emissions from vehicles’ materials are expected to account for 60% of the total vehicle lifecycle emissions by 2040.

The European Green Deal provides a unique opportunity for the European automotive value chain to accelerate the transition to a resource-efficient, low-carbon and competitive future.

However, setting the right level of ambition and placing the supply chain on an attainable path to sustainability requires close public-private collaboration. The automotive sector can support it by accelerating the use of circular materials, higher value-retention processes, and improving the utilisation of vehicles.

With such a challenging task at hand, what should be the policy priorities of collaboration over the coming months?

There are five key opportunities for immediate actions in a new report, which according to European Commissioner Vălean provides a timely and compelling case that will inform and inspire EU-level policy-making.

**Setting stringent and enforceable CO2 standards**

Passenger cars and vans are respectively responsible for around 12% and 2.5% of total EU emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the main greenhouse gas. Since Europe introduced a CO2 regulation in 2010, with a CO2 target of 95 g/km by 2020, sales of electric cars (EVs) have surged beyond even the most optimistic forecasts.",,/r/europe/comments/nyt8ig/five_steps_the_eu_can_take_to_create_a_circular/h1lvxfk/,quixotic_cynic,1623579020

EV sales reached over 10% of total car sales in 2020 and are expected to hit 15% in 2021. However, over the past few years the pace of average emissions reduction per manufacturer declined. 
Faster decarbonisation of the transport sector is key to achieve the EU climate goals and a 1.5°C Paris aligned economy.

A new study from the International Council for Cleaner Transportation (ICCT), an environmental think tank, notes that stronger EU CO2 emissions standards for passenger cars are technically feasible and will result in cost savings for consumers.

The Circular Cars Initiative European policy paper proposes to first revise CO2 emission performance standards for cars and vans in line with the updated EU climate targets and require standardised, lifecycle-based CO2 assessment disclosure for vehicles, to prepare the legislation for full vehicle lifecycle emission incorporation in the future.

**A focused effort on urban mobility transitions**

Europe’s urban mobility accounts for 40% of all its CO2 emissions of road transport and up to 70% of other pollutants from transport.

The European Commission has set up institutional structures to support an iterative urban mobility transition among member states, and dedicated pilot projects for exploring the best way forward, such as the EC’s urban access regulation (also known as ReVeAl).

Furthermore, the EU Urban Mobility Package recently entered a new consultation round. However, EU tools for effectively supporting sustainable urban mobility systems have been found insufficient.

Therefore, the EU should use the Urban Mobility Package’s revision as an opportunity to expand the EU’s toolbox for supporting sustainable mobility. This includes providing guidance for national legal frameworks, implementing high-occupancy vehicle access regulations, and developing appropriate pricing systems that reflect sustainability in mobility offers.",,/r/europe/comments/nyt8ig/five_steps_the_eu_can_take_to_create_a_circular/h1lw14d/,quixotic_cynic,1623579116

**Standing firm on an ambitious battery regulation**

Last December, the European Commission published its proposal for a revision to the Battery Directive 2006/66/EC which aims to ensure that all stages of a battery’s lifecycle correspond to the ambitious goals of the Circular Economy action plan.

The Circular Cars Initiative underscores that this regulation, especially if implemented in its ambitious form, could become the world’s first ever sustainable battery law, underpinning the development of a green and competitive transition to electric mobility.

In particular, the Initiative calls for increasing ambition levels in recovery quota for lithium and upholding the requirement for battery carbon footprint disclosure to set the foundations for vehicle lifecycle-based assessments.

**End-of-life directive for vehicles**

Entering into force already two decades ago, Europe’s End-of-Life vehicle directive aimed to ensure safe and environmentally sound production, recollection, dismantling and disposal of end-of-life vehicles.

Among others, it prohibits the use of certain hazardous substances when manufacturing new vehicles and sets targets for recycling vehicles. However, the regulation has not been entirely successful as an estimated 35% of all vehicles in the EU are considered of unknown whereabouts at their end of life, and high-value recovery of materials used in vehicles remains elusive.

Instead, this rule for vehicles must be revised with a lifecycle perspective and improved data transparency. It should include targets for higher-value-retention processes (e.g. remanufacturing), recovery targets differentiated by material type and quality, carefully balanced content quotas for recycled materials, and well-functioning vehicle (de)-registration systems.

Given the transition to new supply chains with the transition to zero tailpipe emission drivetrains, and the increase in current car park replacement rate, the window of opportunity to shape the footprint of end-of-life is now.",,/r/europe/comments/nyt8ig/five_steps_the_eu_can_take_to_create_a_circular/h1lw302/,quixotic_cynic,1623579165

**Establish digital product passports and a European data space for mobility**

Along the process, there is a need to support the establishment of efficient, standardised data-sharing for material lifecycle management. This can be achieved through digital product passports and shared mobility.

Several integrated multimodal transport applications already exist, and many private and public mobility providers already collaborate on making their service data accessible across platforms.

As part of the European Green Deal and Mobility Data Space, this approach can be formulised and mainstreamed.

A recent example is the European Green Digital Coalition, that already houses mobility service providers. Another one is the creation of the Battery Passport, which has been enshrined in the Battery Regulation draft and will be required for all vehicle batteries coming into service starting 2026.

**‘The only way to produce talent is to get kids of all backgrounds playing. The world’s most egalitarian continent does this best’**

When the Euro 2020 championship finally kicks off on June 11, European politicians and policymakers should be taking notes. This tournament showcases an ideal of Europe — how it could be.

The European championship stems from the most fertile period of continental integration. On June 1 1955, six men representing six European countries gathered around a table in Messina, Sicily, for talks that ended up creating the European Economic Community, ancestor of the EU. Three months later, Sporting Lisbon played Partizan Belgrade in the first match of football’s European Cup, ancestor of today’s Champions League. And in June 1958 in Stockholm, the continent’s football associations agreed to start a European Nations’ Cup, the ancestor of Euro 2020.

The pan-European football formats have outlasted regional tournaments such as central Europe’s “Mitropa” Cup and Britain’s Home Championship. Generations of European fans have learnt the continent’s geography through club names, from Braga to Dnepropetrovsk.

Today, knowledge exchange in European football is a model for all other sectors. The best teams play each other constantly. After Chelsea beat Real Madrid, the Madrileños go home and work out what Chelsea did better, and so the sport evolves. Spain updated the Dutch passing game, and then the Germans and English learnt from Spain.

English academies now produce footballers such as Mason Mount and Phil Foden, who play like continentals. In football, English exceptionalism died in about 1993, killed by the failings of the indigenous long-ball game with its warrior ethos. That’s one difference between football and political ideologies: in football, success and failure are usually clear. You can blame the referee for one bad scoreboard, but after years of them, you have to start learning from other people.",,/r/europe/comments/nytazr/in_football_at_least_europe_is_at_the_top_of_its/h1lw9yi/,quixotic_cynic,1623579345

Weaker versions of football’s knowledge exchange operate in other sectors. Germany learnt from foreign school systems after its “Pisa shock” of 2001, when its schools underperformed in the OECD’s rankings. Northern Europeans learnt about food from the French and Italians.

But football shows how much better this could be done. Here, knowledge is spread around the continent by multilingual émigré coaches such as Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, moving around an almost perfectly functioning single market. These men are revered in their adopted countries and have become advertisements for their home countries. Over the past year, Britons performed four times more Google searches for Klopp than for Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel; Guardiola got 39 times more searches than Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.

Meanwhile, Europe’s social democracy pays off in football. You can’t pick future champions aged two based on body type. The only way to create talent is to get millions of kids of all backgrounds playing, on decent fields, with qualified coaches. The world’s most egalitarian continent does this best. Nowadays it even gives girls a chance.

And so the EU, with 6 per cent of the planet’s population, has become football’s lone superpower. The only non-EU country to finish in the top three of the World Cup since 2006 is Lionel Messi’s Argentina. Four different EU member states have won four straight World Cups. The German coach Franz Beckenbauer’s boast in 1990 that a united Germany would become unbeatable proved false. Instead, knowledge spread from core Europe to the historically disadvantaged south: Spain (twice), Greece and Portugal have won the last four European championships.

The continent’s deepest historic divide persists: eastern Europe lags in football as it always has economically. But Croatia’s run to the World Cup final in 2018 suggests that an ever more connected continent will spread knowledge eastwards too.",,/r/europe/comments/nytazr/in_football_at_least_europe_is_at_the_top_of_its/h1lwc91/,quixotic_cynic,1623579407

European football shows how the local, national and continental levels can all thrive at once. Manchester City’s wealth didn’t stop neighbours Blackpool and Morecambe being promoted from lower divisions in playoff finals last week. Nearby Macclesfield was reborn mere weeks after becoming the only English club to fold during the sport’s worst economic crisis since the second world war.

And football shows that a united Europe can coexist with nationalism. Europe since 1945 has mostly guided conflicts between nations into peaceful arenas — above all, football stadiums and Brussels conference rooms. The only significant outbreak of violence at a European Championship since 2000 was perpetrated by Russians (outsiders at the continental party) against English fans in Marseille in 2016. Otherwise, supporters now mingle happily in bars and stands.

After France v West Germany in 1982, TV commentator Georges de Caunes could still say that for Frenchmen of his generation, the kick with which German keeper Toni Schumacher felled France’s Patrick Battiston evoked memories of war. When France next plays Germany, in Munich on June 15, it will be a gathering of friends. Modern European nationalism is a cheery beast.

3762,"Cardiac cath lab nurse here. So as someone commented below this is likely connected to his heart.  Your heart has 4 chambers, atria on top and ventricles on the bottom. These fill with blood and move it into the lungs and throughout the rest of your body. In order to make these chambers squeeze, they get an electrical shock from cells in the heart itself. It starts at the top and works it's way down via SA node &gt; AV node&gt; bundle of hiss&gt; and purkinje fibers. Now this isn't just a straight line, this is a wild dance cascading out a d down and sometimes across to pass the single and trigger a contraction. It's happening crazy fast, lightning fast if you will, talking milliseconds from one cell to the next and these cells have to recharge so they can get ready for their next beat. That's a normal situation.

Some people are born with 'shortcuts' in the heart's electronics or some have thicker walls of the heart and these can delay or accelerate the signal. When that happens, things no longer move in a nice smooth coordinated dance. Chambers beat out of rhythm, unable to move the proper amount of blood. Signals can get trapped in a loop, causing chambers to constantly contract  over and over, without rest. Now imagine this chaos going on in your heart AND you're playing football, constantly sprinting up and down the field. The heart was already working crazy fast to keep up and it gets a signal lost or doesn't push enough blood, your body is going to feel it. If it happens enough times this can degrade into a life threatening situation. To sometimes get out of these bad signals we need to reset the heart in the correct electrical order this is where defibrillators can, not always, help. You only shock pulseless ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and symptomatic ventricular tachycardia. What do those mean? VTach means the bottom chambers of the heart are beating waaaaay to fast to move enough blood through the body. Vfib means the bottom chambers are just kinda quivering and barely squeezing not doing much. Everything else gets CPR. Defibrillators blank out all the electrical activity in the heart in hopes of the body conducting properly again.

This is why it is so important for young athletes to have EKGs done before stepping out on to a field or court. A basic 12 lead ekg can find arrhythmias or detect certain abnormalities of the heart. There are certain arrhythmias that wouldn't be seen if your heart isn't in them at the time but that's a different story.

Long reply longer, it sounds like he had some sort of electrical issue in the heart, leading to his collapse, not anything to do with the sport, other than physical activity.

I meant for this reply to be easy to understand, forgive me if I over complicated it or it trails off, I should be sleeping instead of redditing. And before other people chime in, this was just a basic overview. There are things about depolarization, r on t, bundle branch blocks, and so much more that can cause issues.

3832,"The Battle of Villers-Bocage took place during the Second World War on 13 June 1944, one week after the Normandy Landings, which had begun the Western Allies' conquest of German-occupied France. 

The battle was the result of a British attempt to improve their position by exploiting a gap in the German defences west of the city of Caen. After one day of fighting in and around the small town of Villers-Bocage and a second day defending a position outside the town, the British force retreated.

The Allies and the Germans regarded control of Caen as vital to the Normandy battle. In the days following the D-Day landings on 6 June, the Germans rapidly established strong defences in front of the city. On 9 June, a two-pronged British attempt to surround and capture Caen was defeated. 

On the right flank of the British Second Army, the 1st US Infantry Division had forced back the German 352nd Infantry Division and opened a gap in the German front line. Seizing the opportunity to bypass the German Panzer-Lehr Division blocking the direct route south in the area of Tilly-sur-Seulles, a mixed force of tanks, infantry and artillery, based on the 22nd Armoured Brigade of the 7th Armoured Division, advanced through the gap in a flanking manoeuvre towards Villers-Bocage. British commanders hoped that the appearance of a strong force in their rear would force the Panzer-Lehr Division to withdraw or be surrounded.  
  
Under the command of Brigadier William ""Loony"" Hinde, the 22nd Armoured Brigade group reached Villers-Bocage without serious incident on the morning of 13 June. The leading elements advanced eastwards from the town on the Caen road to Point 213, where they were ambushed by Tiger I tanks of the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. In fewer than 15 minutes numerous tanks, anti-tank guns and transport vehicles were destroyed, many by SS-Obersturmführer Michael Wittmann. 

The Germans then attacked the town and were repulsed, losing several Tigers and Panzer IVs. After six hours, Hinde ordered a withdrawal to a more defensible position on a knoll west of Villers-Bocage. 

The next day the Germans attacked the brigade box, arranged for all-round defence, in the Battle of the Island. The British inflicted a costly repulse on the Germans and then retired from the salient. The Battle for Caen continued east of Villers-Bocage, the ruins of which were captured on 4 August, after two raids by strategic bombers of the Royal Air Force.  
  
The British conduct of the Battle of Villers-Bocage has been controversial, because their withdrawal marked the end of the post D-Day ""scramble for ground"" and the start of an attritional battle for Caen. 

Wittmann will be killed in action in August 1944.",,/r/europe/comments/nyoln5/13_june_1944_the_battle_of_villersbocage_german/h1l8l2p/,Vucea,1623558894

* Sean Mccafferty - Department of **Ophthalmology**, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson AZ

It attempts (and fails) to statistically correlate total number days that each state was under mandatory social distancing and the “peak mortality rate estimate” defined as:

Those are 2 distinctive different goals. 

Leopold never intended the population of Congo Free State to be replaced with Belgians. 
The proof in that is of how his companies in Congo ( now known as UniLever) operated. Black men  were also in the ranks of officers. Leopold wanted to subdue a population by harsh measurements and by lack of any control, spiralled into having people committing a high number of atrocities, among killing millions.

4029,"&gt; Dude, that’s literal biology.

You unwillingness to put your belief to test is not literal biology. It's being pussy.

&gt; According to you, we can’t say that humans are born with 5 fingers on each hand, because some people are born with 6.

According to me you can say it, but it would generalisation, so not totally correct. Humans are usually born with 5 fingers on each hand. Humans are usually born as one of two distinct sexes.

&gt; You said it’s cruel to make transgender people compete in their sex category lol.

If I said that, it shouldn't be problem for you to quote me. Are you sure you didn't just misunderstood?

&gt; You’re saying that equal treatment is the cause of their suffering. So you don’t want equal treatment, you want special treatment.

No, I am not. What you call equal treatment isn't. Equal treatment is to treat them as gender they identify as. ""Coincidentally"" that doesn't cause their suffering, which should be sufficient reason to do it even if you don't believe they aren't that gender. Unless you are cunt.

&gt; That’s not true.

It is true. I know for fact it's true so there is no point in trying to convince me otherwise.

&gt; A lot of kid when not affirmed in their delusion change their mind.

When they change their mind they don't transition so they are irrelevant to this discussion and in no way disprove that transition is better for actual transexuals.

&gt; The fact that you don’t know the impact that the case in which the Tavistock clinic was involved says a lot about how ignorant you are on this subject.

Fact? Have you considered possibility that I don't lack knowledge, but just don't consider it to be huge deal as you do? I asked you whether I should iscard general consensus of psychiatrists and multiple studies because Tavistock gender clinic. Answer my fucking question.

&gt; I’ll pretend that children aren’t put on puberty blockers

Children are put on puberty blockers for various reasons, which is fine. More importantly it's not transition.

&gt; and that teenage girls aren’t getting double mastectomies

How many? How old? For what reason? You don't care. Just ignorant moral panic.

&gt; How is this not denial?

Because it doesn't fit definition of denial. Saying that something isn't when it isn't is not denial. ""Biological sex doesn't exist"" is not discourse, it's straw man.

&gt; I said, they started by saying « sex and gender are different », but now have changed to « sex doesn’t exist ». 

No you didn't. You said ""Because the trans discourse is now that biological sex doesn’t exist, when they started with « sex and gender is different »""

Problem is not my English, but your confusing syntax. My interpretation was that they did former when they did latter.

&gt; Yeah right, you’ve exposed multiple times that you don’t know shit.

That is your irrelevant opinion.

&gt; Do you know how many times I’ve asked this question to a trans activists and wasn’t able to get an answer other than « a woman is someone who identifies as a woman »?

That is valid answer. Your refusal to accept it doesn't mean it doesn't count.

&gt; And yeah sure, let’s fight for women right without knowing who we’re actually supporting

What is wrong with supporting those who identify as women?

4063,"&gt; Yea because the laws are implented by the state, this making christian courts unneccessary. 

There are no prescriptions in the bible to have a  Christian court.  The judgement will be in afterlife. You can sin and repent, whatever. It's all 2.0 since Jesus, loose, hippy-ish. Very different! 

&gt; A country can fully extreme implent sharia or not at all and something imbetween.

Basically what I'm saying they need to outright reject sharia to reform. Everybody basically agrees what it is, and when it's not that then again everybody knows.

That is a very difficult barrier as they need to greatly, openly go against the holy book in a very important way. You almost have to be functionally atheist. Because you know you don't live under proper sharia. And you know it says you should. 

So reformation is very difficult because of the specifics of the religion.  Can't explain it  better. 

&gt;  We had in the past a swing to more secularism/westernization with the arab spring, 

But that was against dictatorships. By a tiny minority. 

Once  democracy came, masses of  people showed their religion understanding, that it should be one thing with the state basically. AS is prescribed. I can't argue with that.

If a broadcast station stayed on the world feed they got screwed by the on-site director doing a really bad job in my opinion. Some channels may not have the other feeds I mentioned on hand.

4145,"The newspapers here aren't great here either, but of the less crap ones:

- *The Financial Times* is probably the least biased, but as the name suggests it's mainly business news, and is often very dry.

- *The Times* is the main centre-right paper, it's mostly reliable but is often biased towards the Conservatives.

- *The Guardian* is the equivalent for the centre-left. It sometimes gets too caught up in American politics, but on the whole it's a decent paper (I read it  the most out of the three).

*The Telegraph* used to be somewhat readable, but has lurched to the right in recent years and is now no more than a mouthpiece for the government (it's often nicknamed ""The Torygraph"").

I would also recommend *Private Eye*, which is a fortnightly magazine with a mix of satire and investigative journalism. It has a different perspective from the others, and criticises all sides relatively equally. It doesn't have a website, but I believe you can get it delivered by post.

Not a newspaper, but the BBC does a decent job on the whole, despite its critics (it's obviously held to higher standards than the others because it's publicly funded).

4263,"By genocide, the murder of hostages, reprisal raids, forced labor, ""euthanasia,"" starvation, exposure, medical experiments, and terror bombing, and in the concentration and death camps, the Nazis murdered from 15,003,000 to 31,595,000 people, most likely 20,946,000 men, women, handicapped, aged, sick, prisoners of war, forced laborers, camp inmates, critics, homosexuals, Jews, Slavs, Serbs, Germans, Czechs, Italians, Poles, French, Ukrainians, and many others. Among them, 1,000,000 were children under eighteen years of age. And none of these monstrous figures even include civilian and military combat or war-deaths.  
As high as this human cost of the Nazis was for the Germans, it was higher for the countries they invaded and occupied, particularly in the East. Not only did the Nazis eliminate actual critics and opponents as a matter of course, but they also prevented any serious potential opposition by simply exterminating the top leadership, intellectuals, and professionals. Besides Jews, the Germans murdered near 2,400,000 Poles, 3,000,000 Ukrainians, 1,593,000 Russians, and 1,400,000 Byelorussians, many of these among the best and the brightest men and women. The Nazis killed in cold blood nearly one out of every six Polish or Soviet citizens, including Jews, under their rule.

  
The Nazis murdered as an administrative device. They used terror and mass reprisals to maintain their control, prevent sabotage, and safeguard their soldiers. For the partisans or underground to kill a German soldier could mean that the Nazis would round up and execute all the men in a nearby village, burn the village to the ground, and send all the women and children off to concentration camps. In retaliation for sabotage, they would shoot dozens and even hundreds of hostages.

  
In some occupied areas in which the Nazis had to contend with well organized and active guerrilla units, they applied a simple rule: they would massacre one hundred nearby civilians for every German soldier killed; fifty for every one wounded. Often this was a minimum that might be doubled or tripled. They thus killed vast numbers of innocent peasants and townsfolk, possibly as many as 8,000 in Kraguyevats, 1,755 in Kraljevo, and overall 80,000 in Jajinci, to name just in a few places in Yugoslavia alone. Most executions were small in number, but day by day they added up. From an official German war diary: 16 December 1942, ""In Belgrade, 8 arrests, 60 Mihailovich \[the guerrilla Chetnik leader\] supporters shot;"" 27 December, ""In Belgrade, 11 arrests, 250 Mihailovich supporters shot as retaliation."" A German placard from Belgrade announced that the Nazis shot fifty hostages in retaliation for the dynamiting of a bridge. On 25 May 1943, the Nazis shot 150 hostages in Kraljevo; in October they shot 150 hostages in Belgrade; fifty hostages in Belgrade in August 1943; 150 Serbs at Cacak in October; and so on. In Greece, as another example, the Nazis may have burned and destroyed as many as 1,600 villages each with populations of 500 to 1,000 people, no doubt massacring many of the inhabitants beforehand. Overall, the Nazis thus slaughtered hundreds of thousands in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and France; and millions overall in Poland and the Soviet Union.

  
But many other regimes have also killed opponents and critics, or used reprisals to maintain power. What distinguished the Nazis above virtually all others was their staggering genocide: people were machine gunned in batches, shot in the head at the edge of trenches, burned alive while crowded into churches, gassed in vans or fake shower rooms, starved or frozen to death, worked to death in camps, or beaten or tortured to death simply because of their race, religion, handicap, or sexual preference.

  
Most Nazis were absolute racists, especially among the top echelon; they believed utterly in the superiority of the ""Aryan"" race. They had no doubt that they were the pinnacle of racial evolution, that eugenically they were the best. So science proved, as many German and non-German scientists told them. And therefore they could not allow inferior groups to pollute their racial strain. Inferior races were like diseased appendixes that had to be surgically removed for the health of the body. Therefore they must exterminate the Jew and Gypsy. So also must they liquidate the homosexual and handicapped. So eventually they must also eliminate the Slavs, after exploiting their slave labor. Slavs were not only biologically inferior, but also inhabited territory that Germany needed for the superior race to expand and grow.  
But then the Nazi program ran into the problem of numbers. Exterminating millions of Jews would be hard enough. But the Slavs numbered in the tens of millions. Therefore they envisioned a two-part approach: reduce their number through execution, starvation, and disease. And then after the war that the Nazis would of course win, deport the remaining 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 Slavs to Siberia.

  
These genocides cost the lives of probably 16,315,000 people. Most likely the Nazis wiped out 5,291,000 Jews, 258,000 Gypsies, 10,547,000 Slavs, and 220,000 homosexuals. They also ""euthanized"" 173,500 handicapped Germans. Then in repression, terrorism, reprisals, and other cold-blooded killings done to impose and maintain their rule throughout Europe, the Nazis murdered more millions including French, Dutch, Serbs, Slovenes, Czechs, and others. In total, they likely annihilated 20,946,000 human beings.

The annual odds of being killed by the Nazis during their occupation were almost two-and-a-half times that of Soviet citizens being slain by their government since 1917; over nine times that for Chinese living in Communist China after 1949. In competition, for who can murder proportionally the most human beings, the Japanese militarists come closest. The annual odds of being killed by the Japanese during their occupation of China, Korea, Indonesia, Burma, Indochina, and elsewhere in Asia was one in 101. Given the years and population available to this gang of megamurderers, the Nazis have been the most lethal murderers; and Japanese militarists next deadliest. 

Architecture is there for a long time, especially when it's made out of concrete. It's not that easy to get rid of, it needs a political / administrative / bureaucratic process to do so and it costs a lot of money. Most of these buildings are public (housing projects, city halls, libraries), that's why they are so very visible. They are shaping the space around them.

Greek settlers were tiny minority in Anatolia because they were COLONIZERS. Greek genetic impact on Anatolia was minimal UNTIL the population exchange between Turkey and Greece as the aftermath of WW1. That was the time when hundreds of thousands of Muslim Greeks came to Turkey and added and changed the genetics of the Anatolia/Turkey.

4544,"An iconic symbol, the Kalyazin Bell Tower sits alone in the Volga River in the small town of Kalyazin, 125 miles outside of Moscow. The steepled bell tower was built in 1796 as part of the monastery of the St. Nicholas Cathedral. The church was flooded and submerged under water after the construction of a dam as part of Josef Stalin’s pursuit of modernization of the USSR in 1939.  
  
When Stalin ordered the construction of the Uglich Dam in 1939 to form the Uglich hydroelectric power station, parts of the town of Kalyazin, including several medieval structures, were submerged under the reservoir’s waters. This included the St. Nicholas Cathedral as well as streets, houses and other historic and architectural parts of the town.  
  
All of the flooded structures were demolished by the rising waters, with the exception of the miraculous survival of the Kalyazin Bell Tower of St. Nicholas Cathedral. The authorities decided to preserve the historic building and use it as a nautical marker and lighthouse. It is now sitting in the middle of the artificial lake and throughout the years it has become a symbol of the Volga River and the small town of Kalyazin.  
  
The height of the bell tower, used as a lighthouse, rises 244 ft. above the water—which is nearly equal to a 23-story building. The unique structure of the flooded bell tower serves as a marker for ships and sailors travelling near the small town of Kalyazin.  
  
The inside of the tower is completely empty, as any relics or furniture were removed before the water levels rose. Many tourists still come to visit the iconic tower to look inside of the ancient structure. It also attracts swimmers and has a small boat dock on the outside for tourists. In winter, when the lake is frozen, the bell tower can be visited on foot.  
  
The Russian Orthodox Church will hold special religious ceremonies at the bell tower throughout the year.

4560,"Sadly I do not know the answer. My knowledge  on this topic is just surface-level only. However, I found on the internet that Turkish Journalist/Historian Engin Ardıç wrote this on his corner about size of the Zıbık.

''The concubines in the harem have to wait in line for months to enter the sultan's bedroom, and they send one of them to a famous Zıbık crafter in the Grand Bazaar to get one to use in Harem as they wait for their turn to have some time with the sultan.  
The royal concubine tells her troubles to the zıbık master and begins to give a recipe for her order: "" how can I say it? It should be big like a Turkish but also black like an Arab. Whether it be curved like the Laz... but it will be hairy like the Kurdish! And it must be kind like the Frank's... thick like the Persian, strong like the Mongolian, strong like the Venetian. , veiny like the Genoese's,...""  
The Zıbık master cuts her off: ""My lady, if I find such a thing, I'll stick my own \*\*\*!""

Probably made up story but still funny according to him it would be Turks. Although I'd recommend getting in touch with some expert historians about sexuality in Ottoman Empire like Stephen. O Murray, Sema Nilgün Doğan and look to these works if you are interested in the topic

4615,"&gt;The F-35 was initially meant to replace all other types of fighter jets of the US armed forces, but this isn't the case anymore.

That's incorrect, it was designed to replace the F-16, F/A-18C/D (not Super Hornet), AV-8B Harrier and A-10.

The F-15 was meant to be replaced by the F-22, but that went sideways when F-22 production was limited to only 187 airframes. The F-15EX is the USAF's answer to keeping the F-15C/D/E fleets active until the F-22 and F-15 gets a replacement through the USAF's NGAD effort and sub-programs.

&gt;the Pentagon is looking to develop a successor to the F-16

They're *considering* developing a low-end aircraft currently known as MR-X to augment the F-35 in replacing the F-16 in places where airspace is minimally or isn't contested, such as in counter-insurgency operations. Currently the USAF expect to make a decision on whether or not to pursue such an aircraft in about 5 years, with them waiting to see whether the F-35 can reach sustainment cost goals.

&gt;How is the F-35 better at intercepting?

The F-35 is longer ranged, can reach higher speeds when loaded for combat or long-range missions (the F-16 is only faster than the F-35A when clean / very minimally loaded, which means an extra-short range), has far longer ranged sensors for detecting, tracking and identifying targets, and has better network connectivity, including satellite communications hardware.",Australia,/r/europe/comments/nxfefn/estonia_russian_su30sm_and_italian_f35as_had/h1iax3p/,Dragon029,1623499449

4715,"&gt;But thats the russian government. there are millions of russians who dont agree with that and we should be ready to give those people a chance for a prosperous partnership imo.

I see no possibility of changing Russia's policy in the near future.  And don't tell me that constant indulgence towards Russia is done for the sake of her citizens.  It is only done in the interests of such countries like France or Gremany.

&gt;What worries me more is that our bloc will break over hardline issues and i'm wondering if the east expansion of the EU was the best idea at the time, because now it paralyzes us and in some cases makes us hate on each other.


If you invite more people to talk, you know that there will be more different positions, opinions and interests.  It is normal.

The comparison did not equivocate the actual proclivities/acts themselves, it illustrated the difference between feeling compelled to do something and actually doing it.  

On a side note, why are so many people (like yourself) so clueless about how comparisons work? You ***can*** compare apples and oranges. It depends all on what you want to emphasize. Both are spherical fruits for example, it does not matter that one is generally more sweet than acidic and vice-versa if your point is to illustrate the former similarity.

Not only that, but the US has sanctuary cities that openly defy federal law attempts to stop illegals from coming. Unthinkable in Europe.

At least a lot/most of the illegals can actually find a regular job and house in the US, which again is unthinkable in Europe. So a lot of them are by now basically unofficial citizens. If I were American I'd probably support giving all of them citizenship, but stopping further illegals from coming in. If they're at the border, I'd check if they have refugee status and if not, refer them to legal ways to enter the country. But some Democrats unironically want open borders, in the sense of literally open borders. But I get that, since they are historically an immigration country and we are not.

Well it's just not true.  

Slovenia and Croatia had a pretty bad slump since the start of the crisis  but at least after 2013 they started growing  fast. They are not stagnant economies anymore. As you can see from [this graph](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD?end=2019&amp;locations=RS-HR-SI&amp;name_desc=false&amp;start=2008)

Slovenia from 2013 went from 32.2k to 38.9k that's a 6.7k gain.

Croatia went from 23.7k to 28.7k which is a 5k gain.

Serbia went from 15.4k to 18.3k which is a 2.9k gain.   

Serbia has [come ahead of them in growth in the last two years](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG?end=2019&amp;locations=RS-HR-SI&amp;name_desc=false&amp;start=2008) but it's not like it's an amazing difference and places may reverse.  

Plus you're kind of picking on the slower growing EU economies. Why not point to Romania, Lithuania or Poland? Czechia or Bulgaria? If Serbia joins it will probably get a boost from what it has currently as a growth rate not get the same growth as the slowest economies. 



For China, I have seen many reports from around Europe and some from Serbia where it turned out Chinese ""aid"" was actually them just selling stuff so I take such claims with a grain of salt.   China doesn't really do charity. 

 Vucic himself is only pretending to be pro-EU to get the reputation boost and get some pro-EU voters. But he's not doing any reforms. In democracy, media, environment, corruption, foreign relations he's even moved further away from EU demands.

 The truth is Vucic just wants to be a dictator and have Serbia all for himself. That's way harder to do in the EU and they're even passing reforms to make it harder on Orban and the like. Plus to be an EU dictator you have to enter clean and then get dirty, but Vucic is already dirty. He knows Serbia won't be allowed in while he has so much power and I'm sure he values his power more than EU membership which will just get in his way.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/nxb2z6/jesus_hates_serbs_freshly_sprayed_graffiti_on/h1hoaii/,ZmeiOtPirin,1623478597

5014,"&gt; Again I already told you that there's different solutions to this. Yes, Opa was very courageous, but he was also missing a variety of other virtues which led him to act in this way,or he was missing a particular tradition which led to him being a mass murderer. MacIntyre actually deals with just the issue of the Courageous Nazi in After Virtue, and I already covered this.

Sure, but as with most solutions to the problems posed by extreme virtue ethics/deontology, it essentially boils down to finding a way to make the conclusion fit our consequentialist intuitions; so I don't think such an argument is really a defense of virtues as much as an excuse for why you wouldn't want to openly call yourself a consequentialist.

&gt;Most people use theory in a very different way from how it is used in science. Your objection is the equivalent of me saying ""a scientific theory is a set of universal quantifiers limited by counterfactuals,"" and you saying that that's wrong because most people don't use it that way.

That would be true on its face; however, in the context of science, having a special definition of theory serves some utility (and that is the purpose of having such definitions). So these special definitions are only valid 1) as long as they are useful and 2) as long as they are confined to that context in which they are useful.

However, I don't think that specific meaning in law is very useful for the reasons I explained; therefore, I think my definition is more useful. And if a scientist wandered into /r/fantheories and started telling everyone ""actually, they're fan *hypotheses*"", I would at the very least think he's a bit stupid.

&gt;Sincerely, what are you talking about? Here's a justification, I got a higher score on my math examination than you, ergo I'm the better mathematician, I'm. It appealing to utility, or any imperatives nor do I have to develop a complex thought experiment, it's immediate and empirical. Not to mention that this gets into a far broader conversation about epistemology and the value of reason.

I interpreted that part of your comment as saying virtue ethics is superior because it dispenses with the need to justify whether an action is moral or not, since such justifications can be manipulated to justify ""almost anything""; I agree that's true, but that doesn't mean that virtue ethics are actually any better, since you can similarly assign virtue to almost anything; it just means we need to be good at how we justify our actions and interpret such justifications. If this counts as a failing of consequentialism, then the courageous Nazi is a failure of virtue ethics.",Nueva Cuba,/r/europe/comments/nwjr62/dictators_only_think_of_themselves/h1heion/,TessHKM,1623471199
5015,"There was widespread support for animal welfare in Nazi Germany among the country's leadership. Adolf Hitler and his top officials took a variety of measures to ensure animals were protected.

Several Nazis were environmentalists, and species protection and animal welfare were significant issues in the Nazi regime. Heinrich Himmler made an effort to ban the hunting of animals. Göring was a professed animal lover and conservationist, who, on instructions from Hitler, committed Germans who violated Nazi animal welfare laws to concentration camps. 

In his private diaries, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels described Hitler as a vegetarian whose hatred of the Jewish and Christian religions in large part stemmed from the ethical distinction these faiths drew between the value of humans and the value of other animals; Goebbels also mentions that Hitler planned to ban slaughterhouses in the German Reich following the conclusion of World War II.

5022,"Racism and ethnonationalism stem from an ignorance of history and biology.

It’s one thing to be proud of your own culture (which is not a stable category) and another thing entirely to be a fucking ”racial purity” eugenicist.

Us Finns have been here a long time, yet we know that genetically eastern Finnish tribes and western Finnish tribes were completely different people. They still are. Combining these groups was a useful amalgamation to found a nationstate between Sweden and Russia at a time when it was politically necessary. These genetic groups are incredibly far apart from eaxh other, but we share a language.

My main interest in life is Finnish folk music and dance. People like me who are actually doing the work of preserving traditional culture, are *acutely* aware of the fact that this project is for the large part a fiction and that these borders between nations are entirely new – they are not natural.

I know a lot of Scottish and Irish tunes as well (a few hundred) and some of them are the same tunes we play on the West coast of Finland. They’re called ”Englishes” here because we had a tight knit relationamahip with the British Navy. The fiddle arrived into all European areas roughly by the end of the 1600s. It’s the droving force behind several European folk music styles – the bow produced excellent grooves for dancing. The dances also traveled around with the fiddle. Most European countries accepted this influence and it amalgamated with the earlier influences. These were harps/zithers and singing.

In the East of Finland then, it is still the case that we have the kantele (a type of zither) and rune singing. This tradition didn’t have singing, but some damces arrived later from the East. The dances were different too, less formal than the Western contradances we dance im the West. It’s like one side of us is deeply Scandi/Western European and the other side is Eastern.

And oddly enough, this is also visible in our DNA. We are a half and half people. We came from many places and interbred.

But that’s also just part of the story. The full story was almost destroyed by ethnonationalists. 

There’s a third native culture here, the several Sámi peoples, who just as well could have broken off from Norway, Sweden and Finland and formed their own ethnostate. They are also fractionated into several Sámi languages even, but they could have formed the Sámiland if they’d been powerful enough and aware of the new European fashion of having ethnostates. 

European national categories are entirely not stable genetically, linguistically or culturally. We are variations on a theme.

When a trad musician meets another trad musician from another country to sit down for some tunes, you know what happens? We play, and at the end of it, we always say ”it’s all the same music”.

Us folklore enthusiasts preserve what we can, but you know what? The best way to preserve is to allow for gradual change. To remain strong is to remain relevant and not wall things off. Those cultures that bend and shift with the times are the ones with staying power.

The Irish are a brilliant example of this. Out of a desperate situation, they spread their genes and their culture around the world. Everyone has an Irish granny, the saying goes. It’s not that they made some kind of a choice in this – it happened by chance because they had very little choice.

Other European cultures that had more of a chance to shut themselves off into geograpical and ethnic prisons, and we have not been as successful in spreading our culture and genetic inheritance.

Look at Israel. An insistence on an ethnostate means the distruction of the (native) other. It means violence because you are trying to uphold an impossible, unnatural ideal for an *enernity*. Like the Nazis tried to do with the 1000 Year Reich. It just doesn’t work. 

We’re animals. We flee from disaster and seek for better pastures. That’s our nature, that’s true and not a cultural fiction.

You can accept it and seek to *modulate* it, or you can try to violently suppress it. Be careful though — if you choose the latter, you will always be someone elses Other.",,/r/europe/comments/nxah90/hungary_seeks_to_ban_promotion_of_homosexuality/h1heysl/,Express_Opposite,1623471508

5028,"My statement was a bit vague. Sorry.

I meant that, although FREMMs can carry up to 32 VLS, this is generally not used to full effect. In Italy, the FREMMs (and PPA for that matter) are equipped with 16 A50 VLS. In France, they are equipped with 16 A43 and 16 A70. That's indeed 32 but there's a catch...

The SYLVER A70 is in fact not compatible with the Aster missiles cannister (basically, they were designed to host the MdCN cruise missile and there's a form factor issue, it's driving French speaking forums nuts). That leaves us with 16 VLS for air defence purposes, same as the Italian but limited to the Aster 15 rather than with the option of using the Aster 30 too.

Normally, 16 VLS would be a pretty standard configuration for air defence on non AAW focused ships and it is what is present on the ships of several other navies like Spain (F110), Germany (F123) and the Netherlands (AWSF) but these have the option of 4-packing ESSMs in their VLS bringing the total to 64. To this we have to add the CIWS which vary from country to country (German frigates carry 2 RAM launchers with 42 missiles ready to fire, Spanish ones none).

On a FREMM on the other hand, you are limited to 16 and that's just too low. Sure, there is probably not a lot of ships that could send enough missiles at you to go through 16 Asters. They are after all one of the best, if not the best, SAMs in the world. A Russian Gorshkov wouldn't do it. They could launch all 16 of their Kalibr or Onyx missiles and I would bet on the FREMM. But what afterwards. Sure the Gorshkov is out of missiles. But so is the FREMM and while the Gorshkov is still protected, the FREMM can only rely on its lower defences (the 76mm). That does not result in a frigate in the bottom of the ocean but it does result in a mission kill... Worse, without air defence and with its position known, a frigate would have to race at full speed towards an escort to bring it back home, immobilizing additional resources.

Realistically, such a mission kill could happen even if only half of the Asters were depleted, just without the need for additional escort on the way home.

&amp;#x200B;

These ships should have either 32 VLS or 4-pack missiles (or both to use a mix of Aster 30 and 4-pack missiles like the CAMM(-ER)) for air defence.","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/nxayue/indonesia_orders_six_fremm_frigates_from/h1hfdp4/,loicvanderwiel,1623471782

To mark the European Year of Rail, we look at the density of our railway networks, which is generally highest in the western and central regions of the EU.  
  
The high densities in capital regions may reflect, among other factors, the relatively small area covered by most capital regions and their high population density, as well as the presence of mainline terminals/stations from which railway lines tend to radiate outwards.  
  
The regional distribution of railway infrastructure is also driven by specific regional historical developments, their geographical characteristics as well as the presence of economic activities such as heavy industries or seaport infrastructures. Hamburg and Bremen are two smaller regions where extensive freight lines to and from seaports contribute to the high density of railway lines.  
  
Freight transport railway lines also play a leading role in several regions where coal and steel industries remain important, such as the Saarland region in western Germany (134 km per 1 000 km2) and Śląskie in southern Poland (156 km per 1 000 km2).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/nxyj2g/trainspotting_in_2019_the_densest_railway/h1hg2fs/,filosoful,1623472253

5118,"&gt;The Amnesty International director called the affair a “national embarrassment”…

Fair enough.

&gt;…and said that it reinforced the impression that Portugal was just a “small country that’s subservient to economic giants.”

I mean, what?  What does Amnesty International have against small countries?

Not to mention that of the four countries mentioned that Lisbon definitely handed over personal data to on protest organizers, you have:

* China.  Legitimately an economic giant, at a  $16 trillion GDP.

&gt;This is where you run into issues; you assume a watch has the purpose of keeping time, but this is not necessarily true (heck, it's not even generally true - watches today are generally used as a fashion statement or accessory rather than an actual timepiece). If Watch B is more visually interesting, most people will consider it a better watch than Watch A without taking its ability to keep time into account.

&gt;No, men are no more creeps and rapists today than they ever were (in fact, they are much less so in general). I am saying that in the past, it was acceptable and encouraged for men to be creeps and rapists, so they were able to more easily pressure women into starting relationships with them. Now that we are beginning to hold men accountable for being creeps and rapists, many are finding it difficult to not be creeps and rapists. I think this is a good thing.

I disagree; morality is made up by the consequences of our actions. A watch may be an excellent watch (in any sense), but that does not make it morally superior to another watch. A courageous man is not morally superior to a cowardly man except in the tangential sense that his courage *may* allow him to do things that *are* moral.

But my point is not just that things can have more than one purpose, it's that any purpose a thing may have is solely decided by how people want to use that thing, not any quality inherent to the thing itself

Reread the example, the first premise was that watches have the purpose of keeping time. Likewise, a soldier has the purpose of being courageous in battle, a mother the purpose of being caring and loving. These are objective metrics to which you can hold a person, I never denied that these are social, yes, morality is social, that doesn't preclude it from being objective. Your golden rule, for instance, is also social(after all we objectively live in a social context), you treat others as they want to be treated because you could not will someone else do something bad to you. This is a principle which is social.

&gt; I've formed it from listening to how people actually use the word 'rights'. In that sense, I think my definition is more useful than yours.

This makes about as much sense as saying ""My definition of Hilbert spaces isn't idiosyncratic, I've formed my knowledge of Hilbert spaces from how they're actually used"". Also, appeal to popularity.

""A courageous man is not morally superior to a cowardly man except in the tangential sense that his courage may allow him to do things that are moral."" 

If you have 2 soldiers and one is courageous and the other is not, one soldier is better than the other. If moral worth is defined by social station and the fulfillment of obligations thereof(as it was, say, in Rome) then the courageous soldier is moral. Likewise, a wise and magnanimous king is better than an unwise and not magnanimous king, a prudent banker than a non prudent banker, and so forth. You  can reason yourself into almost any moral position and justify almost anything, that's the benefit of virtue ethics, it's immediate, you're either good at math, or you're not.",,/r/europe/comments/nwjr62/dictators_only_think_of_themselves/h1h7i3n/,No-Investigator-7858,1623466661

In the Big Tech (which control all the digital media) at least 90% of the employees are democrats. Traditional mainstream media is overwhelmingly democrats. Big Tech is silencing and censuring opposing views. Is it that far off than what China does? Yes the Chinese Government is censuring opposing views of course but the same is happening in the US....either censuring or forcing silencing. And the media and school system shape the opinions of our youth. If they are totally controlled by a party then in effect you don't live in a democracy where pluralism of opinion is a cherished concept but instead in a country where people are homologated to what the Government want them to believe. Does that resemble a democracy or a dictatorship?

So when the US went into Iraq and Afghanistan they just sort of assumed it'd work out. Just root out all the petty autocrats and warlords and the people would form a democracy. Except that's not what happened. There's no shared identity. The tribes, clans, and so on are at each other's throats. A democracy can't form out of that when every clan is vying for control and looking to suppress the others.

5282,"Erdoğan keeps saying “If I leave, our nation will scatter”. He does have a point in the sense that we need a leader who caters to the entirety of the diverse ethnicity we have in Turkey. He doesnt fit this criteria, though.

So the symbolism here is: Erdoğan saying he keeps us all together, and that if he steps off the plank we would disperse. In reality the only reason we have a Turkish nation is Atatürk’s leadership, resistance, and revolutions from the 20th century.

Atatürk on the other hand doesn’t attempt to portray himself more than a public servant of a nation.

5295,"&gt;I never said that China is perfect, I said we should position ourselves to benefit from the new economic powerhouse. 

So you're saying we should kowtow to the Chinese government and jump into their pocket. Effectively giving the approval to their methods and means of keeping their population in check through fear and exploitation on an extreme and vast scale. Remember the whole genocide thing? That thing that's happening now. Forced sterilisations, organ harvesting, murders etc. You're absolutely fine with that because money. That's disgusting. 

&gt;Again, are the US champion of free speech? In the past yes, but not anymore. You aren't even able to have a social network account at Parler or you get fired from your job. And when you have no job, you are unable to sustain yourself....basically you live in fear of retribution for not following the mainstream media mantra. This isn't what a democratic society stands for. So yeah the China Government has a very tight grip in the affairs of the country....but is the US any different nowadays?

There's a difference between losing your job because you did something stupid on social media and having your entire family kidnapped and murdered along with you because you dared to criticise the management. 

 &gt;In the schooling system and universities there is an enormous democratic bias since pretty much everybody hired are democrats. In the Big Tech (which control all the digital media) at least 90% of the employees are democrats. Traditional mainstream media is overwhelmingly democrats. 

You're bringing the US into this again, not me. You're beginning to sound like a shill Chinese account. 


&gt;Big Tech is silencing and censuring opposing views. Is it that far off than what China does? 

Censoring opposing views vs slaughtering and sterilising an entire ethnic group. Hmmm, I'm not sure what the difference is there. They must be such similar things! 


&gt;Yes the Chinese Government is censuring opposing views of course but the same is happening in the US....either censuring or forcing silencing. And the media and school system shape the opinions of our youth. If they are totally controlled by a party then in effect you don't live in a democracy where pluralism of opinion is a cherished concept. 

There you go again, bringing the US into this. I think you're protesting a bit too much. 


&gt;Btw, by saying I'd like the EU to position itself towards China (without turning against the US), I'm not condoning Chinese Government nasty affairs. But when you dig deep in every country you find that everybody has blood in their hand.

There isn't a single country out there without a dark history or even a dark present in some way.

5306,"&gt;To me it seems like you've been really unlucky with your experiences.

You have literally no idea... I can't count how many times in my life I was so damn unlucky. For example in university I spent one of my summer vacations preparing for two huge chemistry exams and I luckily succeeded in passing both of them only to later end up in a hospital with severe inflammation and undergo an immediate surgery. And right after I could leave hospital I had to go back to university, and I didn't have any time to rest, because I had to learn every single fucking day. I think that was the time when my ridiculously bad luck started. I wonder when it will end. I've already graduated from university but I'm still very unhappy about my life.

&gt;There are always bad apples, teenagers especially can be really judgmental and cruel. And some of them never grow out of it, unfortunately.

I agree. I don't know if it's a rule, but most of all guys were mean to me, some girls were mean to me in middle school but they were extremely rude compared to the boys. And yes, some never grow out of it, but I've learned to treat them as strangers.

&gt;I guess it varies a lot region by region, so a change of scenery might do good for you. While we can't ignore our past experiences, we gotta try to understand that the people we've met are just too small a sample to generalize to the whole population.

I know, but after you come across really bad people for 15+ years you have little hope.

&gt;And sometimes, we need a little support to heal our wounds.

A male friend would do fine, but I don't have one. I never had. As if I didn't deserve it. I still maybe don't. There was a time in university when I thought I didn't deserve to live and it would be better for me to just disappear...

&gt;Then you're using the word 'virtue' in an atypical sense.

a particular moral excellence.  
a good or admirable quality or property:  
the virtue of knowing one's weaknesses.  
effective force; power or potency:  
a charm with the virtue of removing warts.

&gt;""Human rights"" has been in the Chinese constitution for about 20 years. The fact that there is not a single term that is exactly equivalent to a given term in English doesn't mean the concept can't or doesn't exist. All languages are equally able to transmit/represent the same information.

Although it certainly doesn't disprove the possibility of objective human rights(not having access to something does not mean it doesn't exist) it casts doubt on our particular understanding of human rights.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, there just isn't such a thing as your conception of human rights.

""Human rights are standards that recognize and protect the dignity of all human beings. Human rights govern how individual human beings live in society and with each other, as well as their relationship with the State and the obligations that the State have towards them.""

""Human rights are universal and inalienable. All people everywhere in the world are entitled to them. No one can voluntarily give them up. Nor can others take them away from him or her. ""

[https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention/what-are-human-rights](https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention/what-are-human-rights)

""My conception"" of human rights is the one Strasbourg decided upon. You're the one who is talking about something very different.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You are presuming that keeping time is a good quality for a watch to have, or courage for a man. These are presumptions that are generally true, because most people believe they are; that doesn't mean they necessarily are.

The watch has the purpose of keeping time. Watch A keeps time. Watch B does not. Watch A is better than Watch B at keeping time. Furthermore, I already addressed your concern about indeterminacy, ""There are further complexities to this, ie, the virtues can be used for bad ends, but that's more complicated and has to do with the need for a certain adherence to tradition in practice.""  That's my solution to the problem, Aristotle argued that the solution is that one virtue can only be good if one has all the virtues, there's different solutions, but that's a bit of a different discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's better than what we had before.

It's better that men today are creeps and rapists? You said that men are finding it difficult not to be rapists, ie, that they are creeps and rapists. I'm asking you how that's a good thing?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is human rights just anything you don't like?

No they're ""standards that recognize and protect the dignity of all human beings."" which are ""universal and inalienable. All people everywhere in the world are entitled to them.

5400,"&gt; Notice that I said unlimited supply. You could replace heroin for the creation of orgasm inducing corpuscles genetically engineered onto every single nook and cranny of your body, allowing you to have 24/7 orgasm level dopamine release. My point was that bodily pleasure is not what it means to live a happy and satisfying life, and is in fact the exact opposite. A good life comes from virtue, in particular it comes from engaging in certain practices, such as rearing a family, making music, and so forth.

None of the examples you gave are virtuous. I agree in that I think those things are generally more meaningful and give people greater happiness, but that doesn't preclude the ability to find happiness in other ways.

&gt;How? If the greatest pleasure is derived from violating one person's rights, why would that violate the principle you provided.

Because we clearly do not derive significant pleasure from doing those things, let alone enough to outweigh the pain caused to the prisoner.

&gt;Skyrocketing obesity

I mean, for one thing skyrocketing obesity is probably one of the greatest markers of progress for most nations. It marks the transition from the struggle of finding enough food to survive being eclipsed by having *too much food* readily available, which is a far better problem to have.

&gt;suicide rates

&gt;technological addiction

&gt;the explosion of pornography

Why is this a bad thing?

&gt;the opioid epidemic

How does this have anything whatsoever to do with human rights? The Opioid epidemic has its roots in a culture venerating manual labor and loose-fisted doctors.

[You're just reminding me of many of these.](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

&gt;Many books have been written on it as well, I recommend Eichmann in Jerusalem, Xenophon's Hiero, and On the Origins of Totalitarianism.

I mean, I haven't read your latter two books, but I *can* tell you Eichmann in Jerusalem is kind of worthless.

&gt;Why?

Are you asking in general, or in the case of a specific example? But generally, there are certain behaviors that are so fundamental to the human experience and to the exercise of benevolent government that any case in which it would potentially be beneficial to violate them would be outweighed by the damage done by no longer recognizing the right to that behavior as inviolable.

&gt;And again, this is entirely contingent on people considering those actions to be repugnant, there's no reason to think that should be the case

Sure, but in practice humans are pretty good at agreeing that certain actions are repugnant.

&gt;I mean in China, for instance, the concept of Right does not even exist in the same way

I mean, no? This is probably derived from an overly stereotypical view of Chinese people - this definitely wasn't true throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and even though there is now a more-or-less effective monopoly on which information from China is allowed to reach the west, the concept of human rights is still clearly present and active.

Plus, from a personal perspective, pretty much my entire view of rights can be derived from the golden rule, so there's absolutely no reason such a perspective wouldn't also be present in China.

&gt;and the Arab declaration of Human Rights includes the right for everyone to be Muslim.

Which is about exactly the type of difference you'd expect from a less industrialized and therefore more religious region.

&gt;You aren't creating an objective idea of right.

I mean, obviously. Nothing can be objective in the sense you're probably using it.

&gt;Great, that's not human right anymore. You've just made my point! I absolutely agree, rights should be guaranteed by the Government, but these are called civil rights. And I absolutely want to protect those, whereas you want to destroy them, that is the entire point of human rights.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. All rights are, by definition, guaranteed by the government; speaking of rights outside of that context is incoherent. Some rights we consider more urgently needed than others, and universal enough that they should be expected to be present in every government on Earth; these are human rights.

&gt;So I can just extend the Hegelian critique of Kant here, and say that any ethical system that does not involve doing is self puffery and not real morality,and in fact it turns out to be an empty judging. That's what human rights are sans war to enforce them, empty concepts, exactly what I said they are.

All I can say is you seem to have a supremely limited and almost nonsensical perspective if you think war is the only way anyone can ever do anything.

&gt;If human rights can change over time then they are not objective universal, they're contingent particulars. The problem is that in law and jurisprudence, we typically want a principle to be universal.

Then your conception of law and jurisprudence is incoherent and narrow-minded.

&gt;Imagine that the reincarnations of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and Mao become judges at Strasbourg and enforce their ideas of what human rights are, do you think that that meets the standard of an objective, universal moral principle or system of right?

Well for one thing, no, nothing could ever meet the standard of an objective, universal moral principle as humans are neither objective nor universal creatures - even if objective, universal moral principles somehow existed, we'd have no way of deriving them except for stumbling across them in some happy accident through our flawed reasoning, and even then we'd have no way to distinguish the genuine articles from anything else. So trying to establish a standard of ""objective, universal moral principles"" is an inherently doomed pursuit.

Second, if the world admired Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and Mao greatly enough and considered their moral judgements worthy of such respect, then I'd have no reason to oppose them (literally, as in if I grew up in such a world I'd almost certainly share that admiration).

&gt;Talk about Western Chauvinism, lol. First of all, I'm a Romanian who's lived and studied in America for a while now. Now, this may be shocking to you, but no, we do not want your rules, customs and ideas, not at all. Not to mention that this is in direct contradiction with your statement that human rights can change. If humans are universally the same(which implies across time, that's what universal means), and want the same things, then human rights should be an unmovable monolith, and there shouldn't be so much disagreement between different people so as to what constitutes human rights.

For one thing, you seem to be confusing all American ""rules, customs and ideas"" for the rather more specific concept of ""human rights"". Second, I was under the impression that Romanians have, at least at some point in history, [shown a rather intense attachment to their 'human rights'.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution) Third, the fact that humans themselves are universally the same does not mean that they won't differentiate if you drop them into different environments. Most if not all incarnations of human behavior and culture are the same basic mental states/biological processes responding and adapting to their varying environments. If you were swapped with a random American infant at birth, there'd be no reason to expect you to act or think significantly differently than any other given American.

&gt;Hardly true, again, why is it that the African and Arab declarations of human rights are so different?

They aren't actually as different as you make them out to be.

&gt;If you don't think that human rights should have to power to wage war, then we have the same opinion. Human Rights should be relegated to making the European managerial class feel like moral people. Of course, this would mean that human rights are not even close to the same standard as natural right(which was the original goal, to be a 1:1 secular replacement).

I don't care what the 'original goal' of human rights was. Again, I really don't understand your weird perspective that war is the only way to ever take action about things.

&gt;There have been a plethora of books written on the topic, including pragmatist arguments that are actually quite good(Rorty argued that opposition to human rights necessarily devolves into ethnocentrism, for example, and so human rights are just better to have than not) which seems to be approximately the idea you have, and I recommend that you look into these books, because frankly a lot of the argument's you're making are in tension with one another. Appealing to a government is exactly the opposite of what human rights are.

I'm sure my arguments are on the whole not very coherent compared to actual philosophers, but I will restate my pretty deeply held conviction that the idea of rights outside of a government is meaningless.",Nueva Cuba,/r/europe/comments/nwjr62/dictators_only_think_of_themselves/h1fwumw/,TessHKM,1623441688

Greece doesn't want to leave either...  Hungary and Poland may get into fights with it  but they actually have some of the most pro-EU populations in the union.

And the EU has sent Serbia help from what I've heard, plus it has made huge donations and loans to improve its healthcare system before 2020, including by critically increasing its ICU beds which has come in handy.

In fact, if you're not religious there's no basis for having objective morality at all. As an atheist you should recognise that morality isn't immutable, but changes constantly, as it is merely another human invention.

Maybe you need to do some introspection and figure out if you've actually given up religious beliefs or if you still cling to the indoctrination despite having given up god. That's a very common thing. People stop believing in god, but still keep the same bullshit morals and values instilled by the religious indoctrination.

They still believe homosexuality is wrong, murder is the worst thing ever, children are inherently innocent etc. etc. as opposed to adults who are guilty of something idk, even though they've never actually sat down and justified those beliefs with logic and reason or empirical evidence.

5577,"well I would put it this way: there are two simple and one smarter way to analyze this.

Simple way 1: oh Lord, our children are being turned into gays, bring out the cross! I'd say that's unnecessarily aggressive and leads to more division than progress

Simple way 2: people are born gay, it's only genetics, everyone is just in the closet, mah pride! that's just completely ignoring the social aspect of this

The smarter way as I see is to acknowledge that there is a certain small and constant percentage of people who are only attracted to their own gender. They know it, always knew it, can't bring themselves to engage with other sex no matter what. They also tend to actually keep it to themselves and quietly enjoy the actual thing they enjoy.

On the other hand, there seem to be a certain monkey-see-monkey-do factor to it, in that animals left to their own devices do tend to hump everything they can get to. Interestingly enough the major increase in the statistics above comes from the number of bisexuals, which I think is very important here. Completely denying opposite sex is very different from ""everything goes"", which seems way more about general promiscuity, flamboyance and queerness than anything else.

Generation X, for example, came to their sexuality in the 80-90s, not exactly the times of puritanism, so I don't think that suggesting that 3 out of 4 of them are so deep in the closet they lie about it to themselves and on anonymous surveys is what you would call ""reasonable"".

So that brings us to the only conclusion here - there is a limited and constant genetic predisposition to favoring one sex, and then there is the social evolution of norms, that can ultimately place no limit on sexualization of our lives. Those two factors may act together but independently.

That in itself is not the end of the world but a reasonable conversation that we can have in the society about what is the ultimate good life to a human and is unrestricted sexual experimentation a part of it. Does it perhaps have some negative consequences, like sexual objectification, instant gratification, loss of human connection, increase in body image issues and ultimately depression? All the issues we are struggling with since the onset of ""sexual revolution"". Or maybe it doesn't and we should embrace the casual daily orgies here and there.

5643,"I see. So you wouldn’t let your daughter be friends with a kid with loving gay parents because this may make her ask you a question that makes you uncomfortable?

Sorry. Look, I don’t much like being told that who I am boils down to the kind of sex I have. I’m good at my job (I’m a doctor), I love nature and learning about science. I have a passion for cooking and I want to build my own house one day. I’m a bit of a neat freak and I love the sunny weather. I love Indian food and I’m financially stable enough to rent a nice place with a good view of my city. I’m not a fan of grass pollen and I drive a pretty beaten up car. I have lots of friends and enjoy going out for a meal or playing board games at home. I have a sense of fun and I’m great with kids. But presumably you wouldn’t let me near yours because of how I have sex?

Of course I grew up with Eurotrash. You’re telling on yourself here if you think that is a healthy, true to life representation of gay people. It doesn’t surprise me at all that you think gay people should feel represented by a show all about sex. It’s just so reductive.

I’m quite sure that your daughter has read books depicting straight relationships. Our relationships and our stories in these books are exactly the same. Does it not strike you as odd that you don’t think she’ll get curious when it’s a prince and princess but you assume she’ll just be itching to ask you all about sex if it’s a princess and a princess or a prince and a prince? Honestly this does sound a bit like projection of your own attitudes towards gay people, which as you’ve said come down to sex and procreation. I’m just saying it doesn’t have to be that way for your daughter, and bonus if she turns out to be gay you’ll have fucked her up less.

Let me help with how I would answer the question of where gay people’s babies come from assuming you’ve already had the dreaded where do babies come from chat: ‘Gay people can’t make babies in the same way, so they often adopt children who can’t be looked after by the person that gave birth to them. There are other ways that gay people have children, but that’s a pretty advanced topic so we can talk about it when you’re a bit older’.

And just to say again, what about this makes you think you are somehow being forced to teach your daughter about gay people? If you truly believed that you as a parent should have the final say on when she learns about these topics then surely you’d be dead set against the government telling you when it’s appropriate, as is the case in Hungary?",,/r/europe/comments/nxd7mt/hungary_to_ban_lgbt_content_aimed_at_children/h1f0rvt/,professor_dobedo,1623427653

5701,"&gt; I get it that many Muslims think enslaving Christians is a-OK, but Christians will never care to allow them that.

Not sure how you got into this. As a sidenote, both in the case of Barbary Pirates and Tatars raiding Baltics and Karelia or even Russia, it was Christians rather raided in the case of Barbary Pirates and many cases in neighbouring regions of Rus, or it was Christians allowed and benefited from these. Funny enough, there was no such homogenous groups or fantasy dreams of yours. 

I'm assuming that you think it's OK to decimate and colonise and then further genocide and colonise a nation for its slavery and raiding in the past is OK but it is only limited to ones like Crimean Tatars? Because again, with the same logic, we can eradicate whole Russia. And eh, the empire you're referring to genocided Crimean Tatars afterwards when they were in a different form but anyway. And Russian Empire went all genocidal only in 19th century when it came to places like Circassia - otherwise it was decimating and colonising, if not raiding and plundering via Cossacks. And Circassian case, it was related with Circassians resisting for 101 years while Tatars got subjugated and became subjects of said empire. 

&gt; Tatars have no more rights for Crimea than Nazis have rights to Wroclaw or Szczecin or Kaliningrad. 

Again, with that logic, Russians also wouldn't have any rights on anywhere. That's a nonsensical concept that you happen to have rights to your native land and country depending on your ancestors actions. I'm sure that's not a game Russians want to play though, alongside with others with genocidal, coloniser and raiding empires...

5776,"Correct, the ethnically Russian people living in Estonia are not the country of Russia. Wow, we actually found a common point!

&gt;You can't justify oppressing ethnicities by actions of a state.

Correct, you cannot. Estonia is not oppressing them though.

&gt;And it's also racist that you apply terms like ""democracy-minded people"" and ""imperialistic-minded people"" to ethnicities

You again seem to be overlooking the important point here - *unintegrated*. I am not even talking about integrated Russians... Integrated Russians also do not face those problems.

&gt;Let people vote

Why would we let foreigners vote? Does your country let foreigners vote? If no, then start first with your own country.

&gt;let them take jobs in the state

They can get jobs already. But without good language skills, they won't be paid much. You cannot possibly blame the employer for not wanting to pay their employees more money if they don't speak the language...

&gt;give them the same access to the job and education market

But now you are contradicting yourself. They already have the same access, they just have lower qualifications.

&gt;by lowering the language requirement

And why would we do that? Does your country lower its language requirement? If no, then start first with your own country.

&gt;or having benefits making up for the disadvantages.

So you want Estonians to pay for Russians for them not learning the language. You do understand that this solves nothing - these unintegrated Russians would still remain unintegrated and Estonians would despise them even more...

&gt;Or at least acknowledge that the reason they're in their position is not to blame on them but having systemic issues.

But it is to blame on them as they are the ones unwilling to learn the language. How can you blame the system for that? The system provides means for them to learn the language, but many choose not to.

&gt;Those people weren't.

And the means of changing that are entirely in their own hands. Yet many choose not to use them.

&gt;Yet you frame it as if the reason was you being smarter

5882,"Look, you wrote so much i can't possibly process this all while being on my phone during work time.

I try to cover at least a bit.

You're digging into the theories of evolution and selection, also going into the often misconceived idea of ""survival of the fittest"". Always remember, all these processes take hundreds of thousands of years, maybe even millions.

First about the sexual selection, with the example of the peacock. 
Of course we are not able to appropriately read their mind, be it as limited as it is compared to that of a human. We can measure electrical activity though and we can do behavioral studies. In many species you will find a situation where a local male has the power over all females in the region. Sometimes it's just the other way around. However it goes, there are always different options to choose a mate unless there's a scarcity of partners due to whatever reasons. Every animal needs a way to choose their partner. Many birds sing, others dance, some have very extravagant feathers, some combine several of these things. In singing birds, it is very common (but not always) that the male is not only singing to show dominance over it's territory, they are also more colourful. Females tend to be more bland. Remember, singing gives your position away, colourful feathers make you easier to spot, especially when the general position is known. So this is actually super dangerous for the males. If they survive that, if they can do it and still avoid their predators, they have chances to get a mate. Of they don't sing and don't have colourful feathers, they might be easier to miss for the predator, but possibly also for the mate. 

So the birds that succeed to get the attention of the mate and avoid the predator will create offspring. If that birds ""is really good"" he may even do that a few times per years for a few years. He just has a higher likelihood to produce offspring that in turn are also more likely to be at least a bit like him, and a bit like the mother birds that apparently selected this mate for one reason or another.

We do not know precisely that the females really choose ""because they may be stronger"" but we know that a loud (ever heard a peacock cry???. That's LOUD) and colorful animal has a higher chance to get a mate. The level of affection is limited by predators, but it's not a hard limit.

By the way, this is also true for humans, may they accept it or not. Love, sexual attraction and the desire to have and live with a partner (if the couple is only together since a few weeks, they are so strongly bound together, they may as well live together) are driven by hormones. The production thereof follows some triggers that are partly programmed into us and partly driven by society and living conditions. Currently, in the western world, male should be strong, muscular (but not to too much) and follow a certain stereotype to attract the largest number of potential partners. It's basically the same for women. Every society has it's ""desired looks"" and a women has to fit into these ""standards"" to cause as many heads as possible to turn. Mind you, these are generalizations. But in essence the first level of this is not different from animals. If you're an average man in the sexually active age range and a very attractive woman in bikini passes by, it's very hard to not notice her and not look at least a shy bit after her. This is normal human behavior. Just what follows then makes is different from other species as then the brain quickly kicks in.

Anyhow. Long story short, we don't know if an animal really thinks ""this mate will give me stronger offspring"" or whatever. We know what certain traits of appearance and behavior make attracting mates easier but more dangerous. There is also the principle (can't be proven but it's almost always correct)  that the easiest solution to a problem in Nature is the one that will be/is applied.",,/r/europe/comments/nwmsa7/student_cleared_after_being_investigated_for/h1e763a/,Dunkelvieh,1623413422

Yeah soviet gold can definitely help but the ""he wasn't shit"" part is coming from your ass. Insulting the enemy's commander and saying like ""he wasn't shit without soviet gold"" or ""we could have beaten them if they didn't have the Turkish drones"" shows how ultranationalist you're. 

&gt;totalitarian centrist

  Atatürk is not a centrist. He was a authoritarian leftist. And he wasn't exactly totalitarian he literally have women voting rights before most of the western countries. He even abolished the caliphate which he could have been as much totalitarian as he wants with this. He was in a single party political system but he didn't wanted to be in a single political party system He tried 3 times to bring more political parties. But he failed because of Islamist every time.

On the other hand, most of kurds and islamists were under the pression of the politics that kept Turkey from internal coups. So those groups so higher pression after him since CHP used Ataturk as a political slogan and pressured people just like what Erdoğan does now.

Is there any proof that the conclusions reached through science and the scientific method regarding these supposed ""philosophical issues"" are correct? Obviously not, because if you reject the scientific method there is no way to falsify the philosophical assumptions. 

What we have seen over centuries of human history is that the amount of things that was at times considered to be a philosophical matter was almost 100%, and then gradually decreased. When phenomenons started to be investigated through the scientific method more and more theories were proven to be either correct or not while for centuries in some case people argued what was the correct philosophical interpretation without having any way of stopping these discussions and fights, because they did not have the capabilities that the scientific method has of proving or disproving those theories. With the scientific method this capability was applied, and human advancement could move forward from things that were very old and had no apparent solutions without the method.
