Wishful thinking. Not everyone is obsessed with Turkey like you, /u/2A1ZA.

&gt;  I am pleasantly surprised that two German ladies, Ms von der Leyen as European Commission president and Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer as German defence minister, are currently taking a lead in preparing Europe for the future.

Von der Leyen is [corrupt](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-scandal-hanging-over-ursula-von-der-leyen/) and responsible for the sad state the Bundeswehr is currently in.
Kramp-Karrenbauer seems very amateurish and unqualified as well, also her [public poll ratings](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend-1861~magnifier_pos-0.html) are absolutely horrible.

With these crooks it will only end in wasted tax money, I am calling it.

They are the ones that think that the Russians must have brainwashed them.  Russia didn't brainwash anybody.  They just leveraged social media and got the voters to turn out amongst the idiots of a few key swing states.

&gt; Are we going to fight them on our own or what?

See above. We won't be able to. 

&gt; If Germany's main task will be babysitting eastern europe

Babysitting? Jeez. Germany's main task is to contribute a fair amount to alliance defence. And because it's the only reasonable way to measure contributions that fair amount was agreed to be a defence budget of 2% of GDP. 


&gt; Does the bundeswehr need a budget of +70 billion euros for this, when its obvious their problems cant be fixed with money alone?

Here we're agreeing. Increasing the budget without fixing the inefficiencies is a waste of money. That doesn't make the 2% target obsolete though. 

&gt; It's pretty clear the 2% dogma has been designed to make nato members buy more US arms first and foremost.

226,"""On the morning of 7 November 1938, Polish-German Jew Herschel Grynszpan, 17, went to the German embassy in Paris and asked to speak with an embassy official. After he had learned of the deportation of his parents from Germany to the Polish frontier, Grynszpan assassinated Ernst vom Rath, the third secretary of the German embassy in Paris. He shot the 29-year-old vom Rath five times, mortally wounding him with bullets to the spleen, stomach and pancreas.

Adolf Hitler himself sent his two best doctors, personal physician Karl Brandt and surgeon Georg Magnus, to Paris to try to save vom Rath's life. Hitler promoted vom Rath, who had been a junior officer at the embassy, to the rank of Legal Consul, First Class (Gesandtschaftsrat I. Klasse) hours before vom Rath's death on 9 November at 17:30 (5:30 p.m.). Kristallnacht was launched within hours.

Why Grynszpan, who had fled from Germany to France in 1936, chose vom Rath is not known with certainty, although he was upset over news that his family was being deported from Germany back to Poland. As far as it can be established, Grynszpan and Rath did not know each other. Most accounts of the shooting state that Grynszpan did not ask for vom Rath by name but only asked to speak to a member of the diplomatic staff. The records were falsified in 1942, and the Germans spread propaganda that Grynszpan's intention was to kill the ambassador, Count Johannes von Welczeck.

Grynszpan, who was immediately arrested and confessed, insisted his motives were to avenge the Jewish people for the actions already taken by the Germans. He had a postcard on him written to his parents that read, ""With God's help. My dear parents, I could not do otherwise, may God forgive me, the heart bleeds when I hear of your tragedy and that of the 12,000 Jews. I must protest so that the whole world hears my protest, and that I will do. Forgive me.""

246,"&gt;Taking the decisions together means that it always goes the way Germany and France wants it.

German and French MEPs, together, only make up 22.7% of the European Parliament. Even if every single one of them voted in the exact same way, they wouldn't **even remotely** be able to decide anything on their own. 

Better yet: even if German, French, Italian, British and Spanish MEPs (the five most populated EU countries) **all together** voted the exact same way, they **still** wouldn't have a majority (49.3%). 

So this claim, that I sadly read more often than not, is absurdly, utterly preposterous.

&amp;nbsp;

And maybe more importantly, it's ludicrous because, just like in any other parliament, coming from the same place doesn't mean MEPs vote the same way. MEPs belongs to political parties, with different ideologies, programs and political views, and are voting accordingly. That's the essence of parliamentary and representative democracy.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Just because something works for Belgium that doesn’t mean that it will fit a for a country like Sweden.

Just because something works for Skåne doesn't mean it will for Uppland. What happens then? Then the Swedish Parliament discuss the matter, and try to reach a consensual balance that will take particularities into account.

The European Parliament works the exact same way when studying a proposition. And so does the Commission, because there's literally no point to come up with a legislation that would be rejected by the EP.

&amp;nbsp;

Incidentally, most of the European legislation is flexible, more guidelines than hard laws. It is, most of the time, adapted and transposed into Swedish law by your national parliament. While the broad lines are the same, the details will often differ from one country to another after its been transposed. 

This is by design, precisely because European legislators are well aware that countries are not identical.

Either way, the EU and its institutions are **very much** aware of the differences between member states, because diversity is literally both the cradle and the lifeblood of the EU. It simply wouldn't work (and wouldn't have worked so far) if no regard was given to national specificities.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Every EU state is different from the others which is something the European Commission doesn’t understand.

I'm fairly certain the European Commission understands this more than you do, considering its job is precisely to find a balanced consensus between the interests of every EU members when legislating. As I pointed out, whatever it may come up with wouldn't get approved by the EP otherwise. 

As a matter of fact, of all the institutions of the EU, the Commission is one of the **most** confronted with the reality of national specificities and, at times, diverging interests. Because it's inherently part of its job to factor those in.

Incidentally, you talk of the Commission as if it was some kind of shadowy, formless and immaterial being. It's actually made of people coming from every member states, and is appointed by the European Council -- the elected heads of state/government of every EU members (including your *statsminister* and my *président*). It's not some kind of secret meeting.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The EU wants to force upon us a minimum wage, upload filters and a link tax and decide our social policies, while our own national parliament which is ***actually elected*** will have no say whatsoever. 

It's not ""*the EU*"". It's you and me. 

It's the people we directly send to the European Parliament, and the people we undirectly send to the European Council, democratically, through regularly held elections. Both of those institutions are ""actually elected"" too.
 
And does your city council have a say on what your national parliament decides? Of course it doesn't. They are two different assemblies, on different levels, and they deal with different matters. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I’m not against the European project but it has become a power hungry political union with the intention of taking away national sovereignty from countries.

I mean no disrespect here, but whether you're *for* or *against* is irrelevant if you don't even understand how the whole thing **actually** works. And I'm talking about the very basics.

Everything you've said has been debunked over, and over, and over again, here and elsewhere. It's time to throw out those Brexiter-grade *clichés*, and try to understand how the EU **actually** works.

315,"&gt;In Macron's interview, the French president decried a lack of coordination between Europe and the US and lamented recent unilateral action in Syria by Turkey, a key member of the alliance.
&gt;
&gt;“You have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies. None,” he said.
&gt;
&gt;“You have an uncoordinated aggressive action by another NATO ally, Turkey, in an area where our interests are at stake,” Macron added according to an English transcript released by The Economist.

NATO's a military alliance.  Not a country.  When a country joins, it doesn't turn over authority over its military.  It gets the ability to call on other members if attacked.

Say you want France to, as part of membership in NATO, to have the authority to be able to tell Turkey what to do militarily, Macron.  That's not a one-way road.  Does that mean that the US gets to tell France what to do?  I'm guessing that you wouldn't be too enthusiastic about that.

As a knee-jerk reaction, I'm not surprised Americans go the other way, but if you showed Europeans and Americans the sort of 'state interference' you were referring to, I'd bet you'd see things close up quite a bit.  


The second one is more interesting, but I think it's kind of useless without also looking at what those countries see as 'success in life'. If, to Americans, that means a comfortable life where you can afford what you need, and to Germans *that shit is obvious* and they're talking about bigger successes (art, science, business, politics), it shouldn't be surprising that the American would think 'if you do these basic things, you'll be successful' and a German would think 'if you don't have crazy luck, you'll never have more than the basic things'.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dtpnh4/american_values_vs_western_european_values/f6yi94e/,Ifkl,1573281314

&gt; Russia needs up to 300,000 additional people per year in order to reach net-zero population growth, Kommersant’s sources are quoted as saying.

-

&gt; The Kremlin lists Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Moldova and other post-Soviet states with Russian-speaking populations as so-called “donor countries” where new Russian citizens could be recruited, the paper writes.

Well, that's gonna be another drain on Ukraine's population.

When you combine a Russia desperate for population with an EU also desperate for population:

&gt; Melnytska, then 19, enrolled in a university in the eastern city of Lublin. She worked long nights in a kebab shop, where she was paid about £1 an hour. Five years later she is still here and one of an estimated 2 million Ukrainians working and living in Poland.
&gt;
&gt;While Poland’s rightwing populist government has rejected resettlement quotas for refugees from Syria and other conflict zones, the country has quietly accepted what may amount to the largest migration into a European country in recent years. There are about 400,000 Ukrainians on proper contracts but many more who work in the parallel economy or are short-term, seasonal labourers.
&gt;
&gt;Their presence helps replace the labour shortage created by the Poles who have left for Britain, Germany and other EU countries since Poland joined the bloc.

[Eastern Europe Feeds on a Shrinking Ukraine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-20/eastern-europe-feeds-on-a-shrinking-ukraine)

&gt;Poland has simplified procedures for employing foreigners, used mainly for Ukrainians, which allow companies to hire people on the basis of “employment intention declarations.” In 2017, such declarations were issued for 1.7 million Ukrainians, in addition to almost 200,000 work permits. The rules were slightly tightened in 2018 to improve compliance with EU regulations, and in the first half of last year, 820,000 declarations were filed, most of them benefiting Ukrainians. It’s uncertain how many people actually took up the jobs, but it’s likely that their number in Poland alone is higher than Eurostat's residence permit count.
&gt;
&gt;Other countries, too, try to lure Ukrainian workers. The Czech Republic has a simplified employment program for them, and earlier this year, the government doubled the fast-track employment quota for Ukrainians to 19,600 per year. Ukrainians are already the biggest community of legally resident foreigners in the Czech Republic — 117,000 out of a total population of 10.5 million.
&gt;
&gt;Ukrainian communities are growing fast in the Baltic states too, where a worker can make far more than in Ukraine. In Lithuania they’re the largest group of resident foreigners and their number increased 55 percent last year. In Estonia, a record inflow of Ukrainians was registered in 2018. Russia, which many consider to be in a state of war with Ukraine, issued 77,000 residence permits to Ukrainians; 81,000 became Russian citizens.

469,"&gt; East Germans began gathering at the Wall, at the six checkpoints between East and West Berlin, demanding that border guards immediately open the gates. The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem. At first, they were ordered to find the ""more aggressive"" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany—in effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through ""as Schabowski said we can"". It soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Finally, at 10:45 p.m. (alternatively given as 11:30 p.m.) on 9 November, Harald Jäger, the commander of the Bornholmer Straße border crossing yielded, allowing for the guards to open the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking. As the Ossis swarmed through, they were greeted by Wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing.

485,"""Biscuit"" is used all over in the US -- it just means a different sort of food.

A ""biscuit"" in British English is a ""cookie"" in American English.

A ""biscuit"" in American English is...I think the closest thing in British English is a ""scone"".  Not particularly sweet, often eaten with butter or jam, usually at breakfast, and sometimes with gravy in the Southern US.

*goes to Wikipedia for a better definition*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuit

&gt; In the United States and some parts of English Canada, a ""biscuit"" is a quick bread, somewhat similar to a [scone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scone), and usually unsweetened. Leavening is achieved through the use of baking powder or, when using buttermilk, baking soda. Biscuits are usually referred to as either ""baking powder biscuits""[2] or ""buttermilk biscuits"" if buttermilk is used rather than milk as a liquid. A Southern regional variation using the term ""beaten biscuit"" (or in New England ""sea biscuit"") is closer to hardtack than soft dough biscuits.[3]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dtfklq/eu_makers_of_atms_recognising_the_new_world_order/f6yf4qb/,duisThias,1573277489

530,"&gt; A subset of EU members trying to use EU structures to increase cost effectiveness rather than increase capabilities, while suggesting that it could lead to something that means NATO is no longer required is actively problematic.

Increasing cost-effectiveness goes hand in hand with increasing capabilities. National defence budgets are finite; it's only sensible that Member States collaborate on joint projects to increase availability of the associated technology.

And why should we take NATO for granted when its strongest member starts being wishy-washy about Article 5, or when another NATO state unilaterally launches a war of aggression whose consequences stand to harm other members?

NATO was necessary in an environment where the entire world was split into two camps, east versus west, blue versus red. In a different era with different geopolitical conditions, Europe needs European solutions for European problems.

&gt; We haven't really seen a change at all.

If you think PESCO wasn't a monumental development, we'll just have to agree to disagree. I think you will find analysts across the globe to be largely sharing my impression, or at least that is what I have read at the time. Side note, this is also what caused China to look at the EU with different eyes, and where the term ""multipolar world order"" originates from.

&gt; If you look at something like the issues caused by Schengen and a failure to properly find common solutions to border security and asylum and apply them to defence you have a nightmare scenario on your hands.

The way I see it, it's about replacing one non-functioning system with another. Maybe it'll work better, maybe it won't, but I don't see a harm in trying. We would not leave NATO until we have developed the necessary capabilities to stand on our own two feet, anyways -- unless the Alliance implodes before that point. So what's there to lose?

And since you mention Germany, are you aware of the Franco-German project for the successor to the Eurofighter?

So-called alternatively fuelled vehicles accounted for 9.9 per cent of the market, up from 6.9 per cent in the same month a year earlier, as demand for green vehicles climbed against the backdrop of falling overall sales.
New car sales in Britain fell 6.7 per cent last month compared to October 2018, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders released on Tuesday showed.
Sales over the first 10 months of the year were 2m, 2.9 per cent down on last year and the lowest level for the period since 2013.

The rise in green sales in October was driven by hybrids, which climbed almost a third to 7,950 vehicles, a market share of 5.5 per cent.

548,"&gt; Increasing cost-effectiveness goes hand in hand with increasing capabilities. 

Not if the aim is to save money not build capability. We've seen this again and again (indeed the UK is a good example of the issues with cost saving exercises increasing costs when you have to rebuild capability...). If the EU looks like a vehicle to allow a reduction in spending (through pooling) then that'll be very attractive, regardless of the impact on capability.

&gt;National defence budgets are finite; it's only sensible that Member States collaborate on joint projects to increase availability of the associated technology.

Sure.

&gt;And why should we take NATO for granted when its strongest member starts being wishy-washy about Article 5, or when another NATO state unilaterally launches a war of aggression whose consequences stand to harm other members?

The issue is that the benefit of NATO is strategic depth (That the EU doesn't have on it's on, in pure geographic terms, but NATO arguably still does even without the US..) and frankly the issue here is setting up the EU as a counterbalance to the US (while NATO is part of the US toolset for maintaining its 'pole'). You can hardly be part of the US sphere while creating a separate pole in a multi-polar world after all.. And if the EU wants to create a truly independent defence structure then it has to be solid, which is not even close to being the case now in theory,  never mind in practice. The half arsed approach that the EU is good at can be papered over in other areas, it can't when it comes to defence.

&gt;NATO was necessary in an environment where the entire world was split into two camps, east versus west, blue versus red. In a different era with different geopolitical conditions, Europe needs European solutions for European problems.

And that'd be great if the EU was 'Europe' and all EU members agreed with that notion. But they don't certainly not in terms of defence, not even in terms of foreign policy at the moment. 

&gt;The way I see it, it's about replacing one non-functioning system with another.

The current system does function though. Replacing a functioning system with a non-functioning one is a massive risk, especially when you are talking about defence and especially when you are also talking about military risks along at least two borders (and apparently aiming to counterbalance the only current global superpower at the same time). 

&gt; Maybe it'll work better, maybe it won't, but I don't see a harm in trying. 

The harm in trying is that it's going to damage the existing systems in place if it is going to be useful. And arguably if it doesn't then it won't work at all.

&gt;We would not leave NATO until we have developed the necessary capabilities to stand on our own two feet, anyways -- unless the Alliance implodes before that point. So what's there to lose?

The US and other NATO members are not going to sit there and watch the EU try to create a competitor as a prelude to leaving NATO for a start..

&gt;And since you mention Germany, are you aware of the Franco-German project for the successor to the Eurofighter?

Yes.. That's a bilateral agreement. You'll no doubt be aware that there are quite a lot of bilateral agreements and ongoing projects between EU members (and between EU and non-EU members) in the area of defence..

&gt;Those two countries in particular have started to collaborate a lot on military development lately. 

Indeed, and they have had some major issues too, especially with Germany being flaky both in following through on commitments, shifting requirements and causing issues for export variants on projects (geared toward recouping development costs..).

&gt;Troop deployments will probably remain somewhat unpopular, but that's no different than the situation under NATO, and German soldiers still went to die in Afghanistan when the US triggered Article 5. So what would change?

It's very different if you start talking about EU level decisions on deployments, and EU level command and control of formations (rather than national control under EU auspices..)",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/dtjiqv/soft_power_will_no_longer_be_enough_if_the_eu/f6y42x6/,-ah,1573267041

Start here re: settled status is so easy and great: https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/70-000-children-not-granted-permanent-right-to-stay-in-uk-after-brexit-1-6364549

Currently EU27 migrants have practically the same rights as UK citizens, apart from minor details like voting in national elections. That’s the point of FoM.

Settled status gives less rights, you have to beg (apply) for it, and the assumption is that the migrant is bad. The opposite of Freedom of Movement in the EU.

Already EU27 migrants report they are not getting jobs or promotions, are being sidelined when trying to rent a home; the UK still hasn’t officially dropped the requirement for CSI (comprehensive sickness insurance), having paid NI and access to NHS treatment doesn’t count, contrary to how the EU27 handle it.

UK workers rights are currently in line with the EU working time directive, and is set to be slashed back after a Brexit.

A blanket minimum wage is an idiotic thing, if anything it should be do me by industry, taking into account the field of work and potential dangers and hazards. A retail worker at Primark isn’t risking as much as a construction worker.

But this thread is about what the EU has done for its citizens, and what they have done is mouthed off how they’ll make sure EU27 migrants in the UK and vice versa wouldn’t be discriminated against or lose any citizen rights. And where are we now? People who live in the country since decades must beg to stay in their homes.

The EU sold out its citizens who made use of their FoM rights. They could have made grandfathering the rights of those in the country by referendum day a precondition to any withdrawal agreement, and chose to piss on their citizens instead.

587,"Hmm yes actually you’re right that civic nationalism is based on shared ideology and not culture. I was mistaken there. But it’s interesting that you bring up with settler nations (America, Canada) or former colonial powers. All your examples have either stopped practicing a racially exclusive immigration policy (America/Canada) or have become places that people emigrate to (France, Portugal, Spain, England) within the last 2-3 generations. On top of that, all of those European countries except Portugal have sizeable nationalist political parties, pointing to the fact that a sizeable part of the populace remains wedded to an ethnic-based concert of statehood.

What makes France, England and Spain different from Poland or Hungary is that they started taking in manpower from the rest of the world 2 generations ago, and as such the conception of these states has been altered to be “multicultural”, “multiethnic”,  or “civic nationalist”. This is primarily due to the need for economic migrants to sustain the economy, and like I said above, the presence of large nationalist parties show that there is widespread discontent with these policies. In general, the surge of nationalist, right wing and even far right parties over the last 5 years in Europe is the biggest political upheaval since the fall of the Berlin Wall. And it can all be traced back to this idea that a German, Frenchman or Englishman is nothing more than sharing a language and some superficial traditions, like going to vote or standing in queue. 

I think your last paragraph betrays an ignorance of Eastern Europe. We didn’t “pretend” to open our borders to join. We joined with the expectation that our borders with the rest of Europe would be removed, which they have been. What caused the “racist” backlash in 2015-2016 by the Visegrad group was the attempt to impose migrant resettlement quotas. We also never pretended to subscribe to the Western view that ethnicity doesn’t matter.

678,"I respectfully disagree -- but I understand where you're coming from on this! Democracy holistically considered does appear to include everyone with no exceptions whatsoever. But when issues pertaining to a specific group or region (e.g., Catalonia) arise, it only makes sense to limit the democratic range to that group alone. Otherwise, the majority and its ""tyranny"" would overwhelm and prevent any chance at the minority exercising its ability for self-determination. 

Narrowing this broad discussion to Spain and Catalonia, I would strongly advocate for a democratic and peaceful referendum within Catalonia alone. Doing so will narrow the field of voters down to those most affected by any independence decision. I also believe that attempts to restrict and prohibit a referendum in light of the public outcry for one is inappropriate and, in terms of this discussion, undemocratic. Within Catalonia, a referendum -- again, in my opinion -- can only be viewed positively. Pro-separatists are granted an opportunity to vote on independence; non-separatists can put the issue to rest once and for all. By allowing a legal referendum, both sides can feel compelled and entitled to make their vote known, thereby solving this crisis in the most verifiable and democratic way possible. Unless, of course, you believe the current situation, where Spain continues to threaten Catalonia and Catalonia, in response, ostracizes itself, the best way forward.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dt82sv/as_prime_minister_i_refuse_to_let_catalan/f6xuws3/,CrossTwinz,1573259237

717,"The concept of a multi-speed Europe has, in a certain way, long been a reality. It is there simply because not all countries want to go all steps of European integration. Some countries don't want the Euro, others don't want Schengen, etc. For details see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-speed_Europe

So this concept is independent of East vs. West. It is just that different countries value different aspects of European integration differently. (One of countries that has always opted for less integration has always been the UK, for example.)

I personally, for example, am convinced that we urgently need profound steps of further integration pretty soon to tackle the challenges that lie ahead. There is, for example, the rise of China and India, on-going problems with Russia and the Middle East, where the US is not as much a help as one would wish for, climate change, refugees that will continue to seek a better future in Europe (we are very limited in our options to close down the Mediterranean Sea entirely), making the Euro zone more stable in view of economic crises that may happen on the world stage any time, a common European security, defence and foreign policy, etc., etc. 

IMHO for really being able to address these challenges, we have to go towards coming closer to being one European state. Not as close as the US, for example, because no-one in Europe (not even those who want a ""United States of Europe"") want to give up the fantastic cultural diversity that we in Europe enjoy. But I do believe we have to make significant steps into this direction if we do not want to live in a world where Europe is pushed around by the US, China, Russia, India and by what happens in the Middle East and Africa. (Just have a look at how Europe has been pushed around by the US in matters concerning Iran.) IMHO Europe has to become more independent.  As I said, this is my opinion, but clearly I am not the only one thinking into this direction.

Obviously not all European countries are willing to go much further when it is about handing over sovereignty to the EU. Those countries that I would assume to be less interested in steps towards a more profound integration are Danmark, possibly Sweden, Italy, Greece, the V4 and probably the Netherlands. Again this is not an East/West thing. 

I personally would find it unfair if those countries who would like to have more integration are criticised by those who would like to.  

But independent of my personal point of view, as you can see in the Wikipedia article I have linked, a multi-speed Europe is already a reality. And you will also see in that link that Eastern EU countries have not been left out here. (In fact they are fully integrated except for the Euro, which countries can adopt as they wish. Some Eastern EU countries have adopted the Euro, some will do so later, and others may never want to do so.)

To sum it up: The question of a multi-speed Europe (both with respect to the reasons of why this may be a useful thing to do, and with respect to the countries are would be likely to take part in the faster group) is independent of whether we are talking about an Eastern or a Western EU country.",Berlin,/r/europe/comments/dtajf5/russian_general_says_macron_right_in_seeing_ties/f6xjfbv/,nibbler666,1573250794

727,"&gt;Taking the decisions together means that it always goes the way Germany and France wants it.

German and French MEPs, together, only make up 22.7% of the European Parliament. Even if every single one of them voted in the exact same way, they wouldn't **even remotely** be able to decide anything on their own. 

Better yet: even if German, French, Italian, British and Spanish MEPs **all together** voted the exact same way, they **still** wouldn't have a majority. 

So this claim, that I sadly read more often than not, is absurdly, utterly preposterous.

&amp;nbsp;

And maybe more importantly, just like in any other parliament, just because they come from the same place doesn't mean MEPs vote the same way. MEPs belongs to political parties, with different ideologies, programs and political views, and are voting accordingly. That's the essence of parliamentary and representative democracy.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Just because something works for Belgium that doesn’t mean that it will fit a for a country like Sweden.

Just because something works for Skåne doesn't mean it will for Uppland. What happens then? Then the Swedish Parliament discuss the matter, and try to reach a consensual balance that will take particularities into account.

The European Parliament works the exact same way when studying a proposition. And so does the Commission, because there's literally no point to come up with a legislation that would be rejected by the EP.

Incidentally, most of the European legislation is flexible, more guidelines than hard laws. It is, most of the time, adapted and transposed into Swedish law by your national parliament. While the broad lines are the same, the details will often differ from one country to another after its been transposed. This is by design, precisely because European legislators are well aware that countries are not identical.

Either way, the EU and its institutions are **very much** aware of the differences between member states, because diversity is literally both the cradle and the lifeblood of the EU. It simply wouldn't work (and wouldn't have worked so far) if no regard was given to national specificities.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Every EU state is different from the others which is something the European Commission doesn’t understand.

I'm fairly certain the European Commission understands this more than you do, considering its job is precisely to find a balanced consensus between the interests of every EU members when legislating. As I pointed out, whatever it may come up with wouldn't get approved by the EP otherwise. As a matter of fact, of all the institutions of the EU, it's one of the most confronted with the reality of national specificities and, at times, diverging interests. Because it's inherently part of its job.

Incidentally, you talk of the Commission as if it was some kind of a formless and immaterial being. It's actually made of people coming from every member states, and is appointed by the elected heads of state/government of every EU members (including yours).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The EU wants to force upon us a minimum wage, upload filters and a link tax and decide our social policies, while our own national parliament which is ***actually elected*** will have no say whatsoever. 

It's not ""*the EU*"", it's you and me. It's the people we directly send to the European Parliament, and the people we undirectly send to the European Council, democratically, through regularly held elections. The European Parliament is ""actually elected"" too, and it's where European legislation is adopted or rejected. The council of heads of state/government, otherwise known as the European Council, is ""actually elected"" aswell: that's your *statsminister* and my *président*. 
 
And does your city council have a say on what your national parliament decides? Of course it doesn't. They are two different assemblies, on different levels, and they deal with different matters.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I’m not against the European project but it has become a power hungry political union with the intention of taking away national sovereignty from countries.

I mean no disrespect here, but whether you're *for* or *against* is irrelevant if you don't even understand how the whole thing **actually** works. And I'm talking about the very basics.

771,"You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.

Rising rents are due to an improved economy and decades of people moving from the countryside into the cities. High rents suck, but they are a sign of Lisbon being a booming city. They also point towards a failure to provide enough areas to build more housing. If housing supply were to increase, rents would go down.

Portugal receives so much more money from the EU than it pays to the EU that your statement in that regard is simply ridiculous. A huge amount of important infrastructure has been built with those grants, something that Portugal could not have done on its own. That money came from tax payers from the other EU countries. You are welcome, we gave it gladly, because the EU is worth it.

This infrastructure plus the advantages of the common market have created much economic growth since the 80s and 90s, the decades that you so dearly miss. Oh yeah, and the tourism that you hate so much. Foreigners come to see your beautiful country and leave their money there, creating jobs and wealth. How terrible!

As for the immigrants? They are only a tiny drag on your economy compared to how it has improved thanks to the EU. That only makes you sound xenophobic.

Portugal used to be one of the poorest countries in Europe. In the 60s and 70s tens of thousands Portuguese left the country in order to earn money in richer countries and be able to send something back home. Portugal also had the highest rate of analphabetism in all of Europe. That's only one of the legacies of Salazar's dictatorship who liked to keep the populace uneducated and agricultural.

Portugal has experienced an amazing change for the positive over the past few decades. Without EU membership, Portugal could not have achieved half of it. Those EU grants and improved access to capital have made a difference you seem completely unaware of.

Only two countries in Western Europe aren't part of the EU, Switzerland and Norway (unless I'm forgetting something). In order to not become isolated outsiders, these countries have signed countless treaties with the EU that replicate many EU structures. De facto these countries have to comply with most of the EU's regulations and stipulations, but they don't get a seat at the table when it comes to making decisions. That would also be the only realistic option for a Portugal outside the EU. The alternative, complete freedom from all things EU, would put Portugal in a very lonely position at the fringe. Trade would decrease significantly. Economic growth would stagnate for the foreseeable future.

785,"The thing is what you’re referring to isn’t ethnicity, but civic nationalism. Sharing a common culture would make one a “German” if being German is based on culture alone. But it’s not, it’s based on things like ancestry and genealogy, as well as culture, language and religion. That’s the common definition of ethnicity.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group

In that case, yes, ethnicity in this case is “white person who speaks our language”. It’s not coded though, it’s explicit. Hence why European states are ethno-states, based on  an ethnic majority. It’s actually quite a common way to organize a nation, and it’s not inherently wrong or bad. See China, Japan, Kazakhstan or any number of examples. You can also have ethno-states where minorities and majorities coexist and live peacefully. 

The problem begins when you get large movements of people into states where the native majority do not wish to become a civic-nationalist state and are attached to their ethnic identity. Racism is bad, and should be condemned at every turn, but an ethnic group wishing to have its own nation/representative government is kind of the bedrock of Western institutions.

824,"&gt;Kek. EU alone makes up a fourth of the world economy, Russia makes up 3%.

Kek indeed. 

EU as a power is irrelevant  in countries that border it, such as Ukraine - where during Maidan revolution EU mediated and made 21. February agreement for peaceful removal of democratically elected president Yanukovich. Some time before that there were those phone call leaks, where US representative Victoria Nuland laughed at EU irrelevance and said who will they put in power after Yanukovich (they decided it would be Turchynov). The EU mediated agreement (21. February agreement) didn't not stand even two days, as the opposition got the green light from Americans to break it, and install Turchynov immediately, which is precisely what happened. EU afterwards called them to respect the agreement for a few months, but they didn't give a fuck. EU bended in the end and accepted the US installed non-elected government. 

Looking further, I don't even have to explain how much influence and power EU doesn't have over it's other neighbors - Belarus, Turkey, Morocco, Libya. It's below zero. 

Even in the Balkan states, which are an enclave within EU borders, the show is run by the US, Russia, China and Turkey, while the EU power just last week dropped from ""minimal"" to ""none"".

With the benefit of racism, because most countries are either becoming right-winged now (Poland, Hungary, Italy) or start to do so (Germany, Sweden).
Why should I go to any other country if I am treated like a second-class citizen?

&gt;move your money

....too freely avoid taxes. :) 

&gt;High food &amp; environmental standards ( our food and our environment meet some of the world's highest quality standards. Unscrupulous companies can't get away with selling contaminated food or polluting our rivers and countryside.)

And that's the reason why the majority of foods in any supermarket are unhealthy? Full of sugar? Salt? Fat? 

Nestlè and other companys are poisoning people and no one cares because they don't want to teach you a healthy live but want you to buy their shit. 

&gt;Human Rights (The EU protects all minorities and vulnerable groups, and stands up for the oppressed. Regardless of a person's nationality, gender, language group, culture, profession, disability or sexuality, the EU insists on equal treatment for all.)

...while not caring for Hongkong, Armenia, South America, ...., Syria or any other human rights violation. Oh hey, what about Yemen? Hm, who cares, as long as some corrupt unmoral asshole can get rich by selling weapons. 

The truth is the CEO of Heckler and Koch should be put in jail and human rights should be mandatory and not only if it's in the interest of the EU.

&gt;As an EU citizen, you're protected against the downsides of globalization by EU support for small businesses and rules to make sure that big companies pay their fair share of tax.

Oh no. Globalization is just about to destroy the EU. Rich move production and money to the 3rd world to maximize profit and companys have to make massive lay-offs. 

The EU is good in theory, but bad in execution. Too much corruption, too much talking, too less actions.

So that makes it ok then.

&gt; among others, people calling for the death of certain minorities..

Yeah, thanks for pointing out useless examples. Calling for genocide was already illegal, no need for new laws or ""agreements"" for that. It's about ""misgendering"", ""hating on minorities"" (e.g. saying I think all Muslims should be deported is considered ""hate speech"") etc.

&gt; this is by definition not a Free speech issue.

Then you don't understand what free speech is.

I'm sure you would have the same opinion if I don't want to hire black/gay/trans people in my company. It's my company, I do whatever I want. Right? Right?

916,"&gt;If Russia just stopped and started behaving like a country its own size there would be no problem. Why should a country that places somewhere between Mexico and Brazil in economic relevance be so fucking persistent on being a world military power?

Because it can, and because it must. The very moment they would stop being military superpower, the US and it's EU vassals would step an try to stir up shit with revolutions and internal dissent, while at the same time threatening military intervention if anything is done about it. Basically like they did with Libya and countless other countries - destroying functional states, overturning democratically elected leaders that they don't like, turning them into failed states. Same thing that kept the West on top for the past two centuries.

That's why that will never happen. If Europe continues the path it is on now, it will remain irrelevant, and might get destroyed the hardest, should the cold war between US and Russia and China turn hot in the future.

938,"&gt;Are EU laws that apply in the UK decided solely by UK representatives?

Only after the country in question decides to implement it. AFAIK laws still have to be implemented on a national level. Case in point: do you remember the contentious articles 11 (I think it's 13 now) and 17? A lot of Poland's reps voted AGAINST those articles and last I heard we have been filing formal complaints against those very articles here: https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190617/07063042411/polish-governments-legal-challenge-to-eu-copyright-directives-article-13-17-remains-shrouded-mystery-details-may-not-matter.shtml (I can't find anything newer, sorry). 

So even though those articles have been voted through they're still not implemented in my country (can't speak for others). 

So let me ask you: where were/are the formal complaints from your government against the ""foreign"" laws being imposed upon the UK? Or are they still prattling on about how the EU is just forcing the UK to accept its laws?

1008,"&gt; Honestly ? I believe it would matter more if alive. So let's say he is granted the Swedish citizenship then but before he dies... Then yes !
&gt; 
&gt; As a matter of fact it happened with the Swedish before, ask them what they think bout Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (They may know him better under Karl XIV Johan name). Was he not Swedish ? From a french point of view he was both ! It would not come to my mind to say he was not Swedish so why do the Polish behave so ? My guess is the idea of citizenship == ethnicity for them. Not for us.

Citizenship and ethnicity has nothing to do with a person's national identity. If you consume Swedish media, cook Swedish cuisine, talk Swedish, read Swedish literature, follow Swedish culture, observe Swedish traditions, etc then you're probably Swedish. If you don't, you're probably not. A big part of that is what the person themself identifies as. Skłodowska-Curie was first and foremost Polish because she filled all those checkboxes, identified as Pole more so than anything else, and was a Polish patriot. As for French, she didn't feel as strongly about it as she did being Polish, if she felt anything about France at all.

&gt;Well this is a very sensitive matter and no doubt it varies from country to country and definition to definition on the over hand I would just say that you can feel as part of belonging to both culture Spanish and Malay for instance. As for true identity... It is delicate I do not believe somebody can stay the same for 35 years of life, that would be somebody who is not really evolving. Core Identity is not really immuable maybe she felt really Polish when young especially in Russia/Poland or AH/Poland but I would really doubt she did not feel French at all.

You make a very good point there. Obviously living in France would leave some impressions and sympathy for France and the French identity and it's likely she felt something towards it, but nonetheless her identity remained dominantly Polish.",Free Hong Kong,/r/europe/comments/dswwm5/on_this_day_152_years_ago_marie_skłodowska_curie/f6wl9ln/,OrchideanFreud,1573229179

We have negotiated such a great deal for NI because we don't lose any EU benefits such as the mentioned access to the single market and free movement.

Anyway, Brexit also protects our national agriculture, fishing, and production of goods from the cheap and low-quality garbage from the continent coming thanks to the single market. Furthermore, we can export our stuff to almost half a billion people without any hassle thanks to...oh...the single market...we hate those regulations, we should leave that!

I think these perspectives of ‘security threats’ and ‘national defence’ are left over from the time citizens have to spend in the IDF.

That what we thought at 73 and then we learned that the Egyptian army is very strong. At the narrowest point Jordan/Palestine would need only to advance 10k to split th country in half. It's very easy to speak about how we should not be afraid but you need to understand Israeli mentality. It's not about the IDF, it's about being a PTSDed nation with very little trust in anyone but ourselves. I'm not saying it's good, but that's our sad reality and it's hard to change.

What you're missing is that it's becoming apparent, from the US's perspective, that these are the same choice. We'll gladly defend Poland (and Romania), but we're tired of having to rely on Europeans to help defend it, so the US will put itself in a position to dictate the security framework for Poland and Romania. That doesn't work if there's this perpetual ""will-they-won't-they"" idea of an EU army, ergo if the US is pushed that hard, the ultimatum will be;

Neither side doesn't want a permanent border in NI as that'd trash the Good Friday Agreement, but as the initiators of this mess, you're expected to deal with it and surprise surprise, there isn't really an option that anyone in the parliament want. It's your mess, you solve it.

My point is that not seeing Gorbatchev's positive role for Europe is a symptom of Russia not having critically examined its past. The sad truth is that for the past 100 years Russia has, except for its heroic fight against the Nazis, not really had a positive influence on European history overall. (Of course, there were exceptions, but the overall bottom line is not a positive one.) 
For creating a common European future Russia has to acknowledge this and build trust with Eastern European countries.

You can see in many comments from Eastern European people in this thread how big, for historic reasons, the distrust in Russia is. Without the serious will to acknowledge the past and without credible actions that aim at becoming friends with EU countries like Poland, Czechia, Estland, Lithuania and Latvia, Russia and the EU will, unfortunately, not come closer together.

I'm not saying anything is propaganda. I just think it is strange to blame people for jumping to conclusions, while you provided no context or explanation in the first place.

&gt;What does the color scheme has to do with anything?

Red draws more attention, so your eyes go to that region. Coupled with the statement ""would you look at that"" makes it a normal jump to think the ""that"" being refered to is the big red area on the map, 

&gt;Why do you even need to jump to something?

Nothing. Which is why I asked ""Look at what exactly?"" to your statement of ""Would you look at that"". I was curious what the ""that"" would be.

But it literally is. It is not named ""A map of the representation of the national groups in the EP"", you named it ""would you look at that"".

Just to acknowledge what a horrible regime the Soviet Union was to the people in the Eastern half of Europe and to work on regaining the trust of these countries. And for doing so it would certainly help to realize that Stalin was the second worst European leader for centuries in European history.
2. ""Better compared to everyone else"" is the very meaning of ""greatest"". Maybe we are not that far apart.
3. Independet of this, I think you are giving too much blame to Gorbatchev. He did not do much to dissolve the Soviet Union. All he did was to realize that it was not a good idea to hold the Soviet Union together by fear and military. He just gave the choice to the people of Eastern Europe. And after decades of suppression they chose to leave. This shows what unhappy a regime the Soviet Union was and why it did not have any future. This is not Gobatchev's fault. Apart from this, he left office far too early to blame him for the economic struggle that followed.

1252,"&gt;You have to work to get student money?

If you're an EU citizen, yes. Danish people get the help without working (although many do). I forgot to say that you get paid for working, as well. So the government money is on top of what you earn working. I didn't think I had to say that... And wages start at 18€/$20 per hour for unskilled labour.

&gt;Wouldn't it be better to let the students focus on their studies and maybe track the progress of the studies to see if they have actually earned the benefit? 

Well, that's why the minimum is 11 hours a week. That's about one and a half 8-hour shifts per week. Also, you aren't allowed to earn more than ~1800€/mo. (~80 hours worked) So basically you're allowed a full time job for half the month.

Living costs so I can put it all into perspective. I live in a decent sized apartment and share with one guy. I pay 450€/mo. rent, inclusive of all utilities and internet. There are cheaper places too, where the rent can be 250-300€. I spend another 450-500/mo. on food and entertainment. I go out often, I eat good food and like to drink nice alcohol. So I'm definitely not living frugally and my total expenses for the month come out to 1000€/mo. I make that working a part time warehouse job where I work 6 hour shifts (30 min break). So basically the money I get from the government goes into savings.

Wanna hear something else? After I graduate I'm gonna get ~1500€ from my union until I find a job in my field/degree. This is called A-kasse. I'm allowed to reject 3 job offers and they pay this for up to two years. So if I find a job in 3 months, I'll have 21 months of A-kasse left. So in theory I can quit my job whenever, go back on A-kasse until I find another one.

You can also get A-kasse by paying around 50€/mo. into a union. After a full year of working, you're entitled to a year of A-kasse. How much you get depends on how much you earned at your job, the ~1500€/mo. is the minimum for lowest paying jobs or those who just graduated university.

1350,"Because people who write these articles are dumb. And don't understand taxes or tax laws. The fact that this article is written by two Dutch people should tell you enough. Dutch journalist for some reasons love to trash Dutch tax laws, because the outrage sells. 

Here is the truth... It's because we are not actually a tax haven. You see, we, The Netherlands do taxes differently than in other countries. A company might choose to use these laws. There is nothing wrong with this. It's the combination of using our laws with other countries laws that messes it all up, like a glitch in a game. 

Now I am no expert but I will give you a simple example. For example, in the US you have capital gains tax (a tax on any gains from capital). In the Netherlands, we do not have this tax. We instead have an assets tax (box 3) every year we calculate your total assets and tax it. What does this mean? In Netherlands we don't care how much money you make, we care about how much money you have and tax it. In the US they don't care how much money you have, but tax any money you make. So what does company A0 do to take advantage? They make a holding company A1 store their assets in the US and report 0 growth, and as a result pay little to no US tax. Then company A2 is in the Netherlands, with 0 assets but all the growth is report here, again avoid a lot of taxes. I gave a really simple example, obviously governments aren't that dumb. It's more that laws are really complex. 

However, what is the result? The first line of this article... 

&gt;Dutch officials really don’t like it when someone calls their country a tax haven.

&gt; In 2009, the Obama administration did just that, naming the Netherlands as one of a number of countries where scores of major American firms had established subsidiaries in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes. In a press briefing, the White House also noted that, taken together with Bermuda and Ireland, the Netherlands claimed nearly a third of all foreign profits reported in 2003 by U.S. corporations.

The US blames the Netherlands for being a tax haven. Really despicable even for Obama. Why? Because Delaware state has some of the most beneficial tax laws for big corporations, just look at all the giant companies incorporated there. But you never hear Obama talk about that? Maybe he needed votes? Or maybe is the whole state government vs federal government thing.

Anyway. We getting accused of being a tax haven is an easy way for those countries to not fixing their own tax system. 

**TL;DR: This is also why the Netherlands doesn't change our laws, because our official policy is we will work with you to close tax loopholes but we won't change our laws just because you want us too and have shitty tax system yourself.**",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/dt4uq8/how_the_netherlands_built_one_of_the_worlds_worst/f6vyosb/,Xodio,1573208018

So NATO without the US and Canada. This would be better how? Why would the member states up their military spending under this structure when they're not doing it as part of NATO? Also 'production goals'? What do you mean by that? Quotas? If so....wow lol. 

&gt;And anything outside of the EU would need approval from all countries like it‘s always the case for EU matters.

There's a reason that military command is more centralised that other state apparatuses. Under your proposal nothing would ever get done, and if it did it would happen too late. Useless.

&gt; and then you have a whole bunch of regressive forces on the left and right of that.

I agree with you for the AfD Nazis, but regressive forces on the left? What? Sorry, the MLPD is all but irrelevant, the Linkspartei is politically where the SPD was 20-30 years ago before they shifted towards neoliberalism under Schroeder.

&gt; What we don't really seem to have, and what would be desperately needed, is an actually progressive political force that is attempting to solve the major issues we are facing by bringing us into the 21st century

We have the Left party, the Greens and (provided they show some brains and dump that arsehole Olaf Scholz - I will never forget the clouds of pepper spray at G20) the SPD.

She continued to study in France for 2 years at the university, so she didn't receive *all* of her education in Poland.

&gt; In late 1891, she left Poland for France.[22] In Paris, Maria (or Marie, as she would be known in France) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university, in the Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of Paris, where she enrolled in late 1891.[23][24] She subsisted on her meager resources, keeping herself warm during cold winters by wearing all the clothes she had. She focused so hard on her studies that she sometimes forgot to eat.[24]

1668,"&gt; No one went to jail for making fun of either of them, and that's all that freedom of speech grants you.

That's all that the First Amendment of the US Constitution grants you.

The First Amendment guarantees that the government will respect freedom of speech, but that's not all that the concept of freedom of speech means.

Suppose you lived in a country where you legally had freedom of speech, but if you said ""gay marriage should be legal"" then everyone would hate you and shun you, websites would ban you, companies would refuse to to business with you, employers would fire you, stores would ban you from shopping there, and it would pretty much be impossible for you to continue living in that country.

I wouldn't call that a country that embraces the idea of free speech, would you? Just because the government isn't the one punishing you, that doesn't mean you're free to speak your opinions.

I don't want to live in a country where having conservative views gets you banned from social media, fired from your job, or gets your business shut down. It's not enough to just have protection from being thrown in jail by the government... society should support freedom of speech and show tolerance towards people who say things they disagree with.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there can't be consequences. No one has to be friends with someone whose views they find objectionable... and if someone is spewing some blatantly hateful and evil stuff, they deserve public shaming.

1741,"&gt;And Viking slavery was justified by might is right. They aren't wildly different, and just about equally prone to atrocity.

I'm not sure if that's true that they ere equally prone to atrocity.  In a lot of the Ancient/medieval world, there have been a lot of slaves who rose up from slavery to claim not just normal lives, but a great deal of power and the respect of the society. People were sometimes enslaved and trained for their expertise in endeavors as sensitive as statecraft - and certain slave groups - especially slave-soldier groups rose to become partial rulers of the society.  Also, a lot of societies had manumission built-in as a reasonable expectation for slaves who really benefitted their masters.  Slaves were often treated as imprisoned/obliged people instead of chattel. 

The consistent and enforced policy of the Atlantic slave trade, and the absolute race divide between slavers and the enslaved made it a much more hopeless scenario to end up in.  The white/black divide, the ""savage vs. civilized"" peoples divide at play made it so that very, very few slaves were accorded respect - and this was consistent across European nations for a long time.  When slaves come from a variety of ethnicities, and may look very much like their masters, the practice often doesn't generate that same sort of dehumanization that we saw in the Atlantic trade.

There are certainly exceptions.  In 17th century New York City, there was a lot of association between Enslaved Blacks and poorer whites. These cases were not typical at all.  I think the Atlantic slave trade was at a very special intersection of massive scale/consistent bad treatment/automatic dehumanization that was unprecedented.",,/r/europe/comments/dqii4f/bruh/f6v9omc/,MarryKoreanLoseBalls,1573180271

And now Russia and China are literally comitting imperialism in Latin America. Maduro gives them for free natural resources so he can stay in power. He gave Rosneft control over the largest oil deposits on Earth, making them one of the largest companies in the game. And he have large sections of the Amazon to Chinese mining companies so they clear the area, evict the natives and extract without any sort of ecological consideration. And he has Russian and Chinese  inteligence supporting him, and bodyguards too.

Which is at least partially Merkel's own fault.

As crazy as it sounds, but Spahn might indeed the CDU's best hope.

You have a rapidly dwindling political centre that is all out of ideas, and then you have a whole bunch of regressive forces on the left and right of that.

1942,"Okay I feel odd *kind of* ""defending Macron"" here but I'll try to give his perspective and what I would believe he would respond to this as, even though I despise neo-liberals like him from a political perspective.

I believe him to be actually genuine in his concerns about a US-China duopoly in the future of geopolitics. And why wouldn't he be? After all geopolitics is solely and all about power and interests and not morality like a lot of reddit pretends it to be. And under the current neo-liberal structure of the world economy, size of the economy means literally almost everything for geopolitics. And based on current trends and looking at the economies of Europe, US and China, the trends just don't put Europe in a good light at all. And it's not simply a matter of losing power, Macron correctly sees that Europe won't be a superpower anymore and the whole world will be on the menu with US and China at the table like he said. That's what he fears, that's what he expects to happen based on current trends, that's what will probably happen based on current trends too. 

Trade is too important for this neo-liberal world economy but I think what EU cherished the most with its alliance with the US has been US' strong military so that they could avoid spending for the military and focus on economic growth instead. But I also have the impression that not just Macron but for EU in general, that has jumped the shark this decade. Not just because of Trump either. Just proxy wars of the US on different regions in general causes problems for them. Whether the US army gets on the ground or operates by air strikes and by arming certain groups or does the opposite and pulls military back, it ends up creating different problems for EU all the same. Although with the recent development in Syria, this impression I've got could just possibly maybe change on CDU's part but also whether Trump gets re-elected and if not foreign policy of the next US president will matter a ton in that. Anyway, I won't go down that rabbit hole. I believe this is a big reason behind the EU army talk. 

The part where Macron talks about European history and how its brutality culminating in one mega event in WWII in this view is important. It emphasises how post-war PTSD shaped Europe from then till now in relation to how he thinks about the probable future US-China duopoly. You only refer to China in your comment, but I don't believe for a second Macron only sees China as a threat, I don't even think he sees US and China as threats in a vacuum, but sees: 

a) their duopoly from a power structure standpoint in geopolitics

b) their growing antagonism towards each other

as threats and why that part from the interview is important relates to point b. He thinks the memories, post-war legacy and essentially the PTSD of Europe from all the brutality, as well as Europe's ""experience"" in such high antagonisms is crucial in mitigating the US-China antagonism *insofar as Europe is in a position of power to do so*. 

That's absolutely crucial to his politics. There's a reason he explicitly attempted to get Russia on their side despite no contextual framework that laid the ground for that attempt. Same reason why he would love to see Russia change some of its positions geopolitically because that would lay the groundwork for Russia to align with the EU for a stronger Europe. I'm convinced he would be much more interested in turning Russia to their side than he is with the alliance with the US no matter who's US president. Because of the reasons I mentioned above, that is. And Turkey too for that matter, but Turkey is simply a lot more irrelevant than Russia. 

And let's get to the key part. Why does he stress so much over supranational European collaboration in a larger scale than EU even including a different Russia and talk about the probable US-China duopoly in such cautious and problematic rhetoric while still making huge deals with US and China? It's not just because he's a neo-liberal. I think he would respond to your remark about him being part of the problem by saying that if they stop prioritising economic growth, there's no way the US-China duopoly and the potentially catstrophic antagonism between them will be prevented because Europe will be on the menu at their table. And I started off with the importance of economic power under current structure of neo-liberal world economy for this reason. That runs through economic superpowers and US and China are economic superpowers, I imagine Macron would say it's stupid to not prioritise trade with them. He could say there's no way of Europe affecting anything US-China related if they don't trade with them now. These are not because he's a neo-liberal, I believe he would hold the same position even if he wasn't.

But that monument is not for fighting against the Ottomans 60 years before that.

1974,"For your first question: yes, Anti-semitism is when you don't like Jewish people. For the second question: in my mind no, but according to the American and Israeli Govts — along with Pro-Israel institutions — being against extremist Jewish groups is being anti-semitic. I have Jewish friends, I have nothing against the people or the religion. I really just dislike the American and Israeli governments and their imperialistic dreams. But according to them there is no difference between hating jews and hating Israeli extremists. I hate the hypocrisy of defending Israel's millenia old claim while at the same time destroying native American land and polluting their water and acting like they deserve genocide.

Edit: My bad, I misread your second question. Still anti-semitic if you don't like the religion, according to some governments. 

Also, as another user pointed out, sometimes Anti-Zionism and anti-semitism do cross paths and people will disguise themselves as simply against the Israeli state, but will slowly creep in the fact that they just hate jews. Saying Israel uses Nazi tactics is a big indicator, because while they do some bad things Israel is no where near as bad as the Nazi regime.

1984,"Oof. Sounds like you really need to read up on Irish history.

My crappy summary: Ireland was part of the UK for centuries, but (at least) towards the end the English/UK treated them like crap, and the (first?) IRA fought a war 1919-1921 for independence, during which the British did a lot of shitty stuff (no doubt the Irish did some too, but reading off wikipedia at least, it seems that the British escalated things on more than one occasion). In 1921, Ireland, which had until then been one entity even if it was under the UK, was partitioned into what became the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland, the latter still under British rule. Mostly because Scottish Protestants had moved &amp; I think been moved there in the iirc 18th century, or maybe 19th, and they wanted to stay in the UK, partly out of pro-UK sentiment but also due to Protestants, well, being Protestant and not Catholic like the rest of Ireland. And those sentiments later reignited in later decades as [The Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_troubles), the peace treaty for which only happened in *1996*.

I'm not even from Ireland *or* the UK, and I know that much, both from recent Brexit-related discussions and from looking it up right now.

And now you're asking that the Irish *rejoin the UK, where they'd be a junior partner to England's whims once again, after they've been a sovereign nation for close to a century?* And specifically, the current politically-messed up UK, with Boris Johnson as the PM? Are you out of your mind?

The Irish do not have some magical right to a soft border from another sovereign nation... no wait, they sort of do. I'm not sure if or how it's written in the Good Friday Agreement (the aforementioned peace treaty from 1996), but at least in recent discussions it's been brought up that one reason that the GFA was successful was that there was no need for a hard border between Ireland and NI due to EU free movement. Now the UK might end up unilaterally remove that ""building block"" of the peace that's stood for 20 years. And the fear is that even if there are now far fewer extremists still willing to dig up their remaining guns and bombs, the results of the UK breaking the spirit if not the wording of the GFA might not be pretty, to put some British understatement on it.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/dsh3mt/john_bercow_brexit_is_uks_biggest_mistake_since/f6un3d0/,ohitsasnaake,1573165157

In that case, they might as well play their game. If that is the reality the EU wants to be to its own members, then there is no benefit to have any moral code and pushing the EU army will do nothing for them anyway.

I do not think so, but what exactly would be for small countries to have an army that won't protect them? To send their people to die? To increase their budget to make Western members feel like they are paying their fair share? Because based on what you write the army would be a pointless and toothless status symbol.

you keep repeating this lie, it was Merkel that made sure another 3 million wouldnt cross into Europe with her Turkey deal.
why do you keep spouting the same right wing lie? that has been debunked time and again.

my guy, has it ever crossed your mind that people might not just be upset about Non eu immigration, but also EU immigration?
even moreso?

has it crossed your mind that maybe the reason why the far right and anti immigration parties have grown in WE is because of EE immigration?

&gt;Its like blaming all Germans because Bavarians elected AFD. You talk shit about Polish far-right government while German far right is getting stronger by the day.

yet they most likely will never govern, the votes arent there.
the votes are obviously there in Poland though right?
you are comparing one culture to another. on democratic system against the other.

and dont see the flaw in that.

&gt;You talk shit about Polish far-right government while German far right is getting stronger by the day. 

i have an issue with a country run by ethno nationalists that would be run out of WE by similar ethno nationalists like the AFD which they view as their ally, which is hilarious.

the AFD isnt in power, PiS is, you are judging a possibility, i judge a reality.

&gt;What I was explaining to you is that China cannot access Western markets with its Silk Road initiative without EE.

no there isnt, but there also isnt a silk road in EE without WE. China needs EE to get TO WE. its a doorway. you get that? 
and why are we even discussing this? i made the logical point that the EU would be better off without Poland in it.
it wouldnt be paralyzed as it is right now politically and it would be more flexible.

it wouldnt be held back because Poland cant keep up.
80% of Polands trade for example is with WE.
regardless of what would happen, Poland would need WE to survive economically, not the other way around.

over 60% of Polands public spending is paid for via EU funding, did you know that? all those new roads and buildings.
thats paid for by the EU.

in your heart of hearts you know Poland joined the EU too early. and now the west has serious regrets about it.
and PiS isnt helping things, it worsens it.

and at the end of the day, why would i want to be in a union with a country like Poland, with the societal beliefs that it has.

The decision was made based on the nationalities of the candidates, pure and simple. It's not the first time and not the last, that's how the EU works. And as long as the top positions are divided based on nationality, it's pointless to talk about further integration. And it's completely hypocritical for Macron to prance around like some kind of ""European"" leader, when all he ever does is advocate for the French interests and French candidates.

And that's the point I was making: If we want to bring Europe together and have further integration, we need a leader that advocates for *Europe*, not whatever country they come from.

&gt; Did America declare war on Germany when they invaded Poland ? No they did not

Was America allied with Poland when Germany invaded Poland?  No, she was not.

I might also add, since you're raising that particular incident, that France made explicit defense commitments to engage in a large-scale attack on Germany of a specified size upon which Polish defense plans rested which France did not fulfill.  Instead, France held back and used the conquest of Poland to buy time to build up her own defense.

I'm not saying that France didn't have real military reasons for that move.  Or that, had France ultimately won the war, she would not have restored Poland.

Half of the applications are from Northern Ireland as many are entitled to a Irish passport under the Good Friday Agreement.

It's been like this for the past 2-3 years, not surprising given the amount of people traveling between the Republic and North daily.


Irish Times [article](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/uk-applications-for-irish-passports-in-2019-already-exceed-last-year-1.4038814) for anyone interested. 

**UK applications for Irish passports in 2019 already exceed last year**

*The number of applications for Irish passports from Britain and Northern Ireland in the first eight months of the year has already exceeded the total received in 2018.*

*New figures released to Fianna Fáil’s Niall Collins show that there have been 85,517 applications to the end of August this year, compared to a total of 79,513 in 2018.* 
*The increase has been driven by a surge in applications from Northern Ireland, with almost 9,000 more applications received at the end of August.*

*Applications have been steadily increasing since 2016, when the UK voted to leave the European Union. In 2015, there were just under 26,000 applications, less than a third of the total received so far this year.*

*Mr Collins said the figures “are a clear indication that people across the UK and Northern Ireland have realised how serious the impact of Brexit will be.”*

*“The Irish passport has always been held in high esteem, and it’s becoming obvious that Brexit has compounded the demand as people living in the UK and Northern Ireland become increasingly worried about what impact Brexit will have on their daily lives and their ability to travel. I expect these figures will continue to increase over the next few months as uncertainty over a potential no-deal Brexit prevails,” he said.*

*Entitlement to an Irish passport is governed by Irish law, particularly the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.*",Munster,/r/europe/comments/dsuxn3/new_record_4120_brits_have_become_swedish/f6skhew/,Conaer_,1573135625

I didn't at any point defending the critique of ''manspreading''. Much like ''mansplaining'' I believe these concepts to be deeply problematic and counterproductive. I am in full agreement with you here.

&gt; The idea that you can understand that companies pay women a wage lower than they should or that a societal expectation exists in how sexes should act and that this is bad has everything to do with posters like these, that stereotype and divide instead of fostering understanding. A simple genderless poster would have accomplished the same goal except for the fact that the toxic feminists would rather punish and oppress the evil 'man' than to connect and bring across their point of view.

2404,"&gt; I still don’t understand why Flanders isn’t in the Netherlands

What would become the Netherlands and Flanders were first united in 1523, and had been divided into a whole slew of small states for centuries. By the time of the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648, sorta) the North was primarily Protestant and the South primarily Catholic, though modern Flanders and parts of Wallonia initially also rebelled. After this conflict, these two regions briefly united under the Habsburgs were *officially* divided again until Napoleon. 

By the time most of the Low Countries were united again by the Great Powers in 1814, the North and South had been split off for over two centuries and had developed separately. There were large differences that separated the South from the North, including: a Francophone elite (even in Flanders!), protectionist views on the economy, primarily Catholic, and with a larger population. 

So, King William I, in his great wisdom, decided to do his best to bridge those gaps through enlightened policy... *Yeah, of course not!* He tried to make Dutch the official language in Flanders, extended free trade economic policy to the South, promoted freedom of religion, and give them the same representation as the less populated North. And so this time the South revolted and those same, ever so wise Great Powers stepped in again to undo their previous mistake.

Sadly I was not able to find the article that I was looking for as it was edited some years ago, but if Wikipedia is okay. You can see the difference between the 2002 and 2011 data. If 57% is enough for an ethnic group to claim autonomy of land, It would be just as big of an injustice as it was for the Romanians to claim it in the first place.

My own ignorance I hope people thinking of going dont have. 

National Parks are diffidently 'Americas best creation' in regard to infrastructure and laws that come with it.. trails, getting around, the entire experience was 5 stars. Zion and Yosemite are mindblowingly beautiful! Overrated city had to be Miami (I hate the 'look at how built and beautiful  I am' culture, beaches were pretty though) but Florida as a whole was great, about the same cost of touring Germany, just expect to drive everywhere, they are very anti-mass transit in FL thanks to Republicans. Harry Potter to SpaceX Heavy Falcon launch while standing on a snow white beach.. yeah, worth the travel expenses for sure. 

California is great but would be expensive for the average person from Poland for sure, very expensive.. especially San Francisco with outrageous prices for literally everything.  

Just dont talk politics, dont get sassy with the police (I never encountered any but still), remember states have varying laws as do counties ie pot is legal in some states, illegal in others.. and I cannot express how different the country is unless you stay in the same state. Americans/Canadians fly everywhere due to how far each city is from one another so remember flights are very affordable so you can hop from one state to another fairly easy (now flight shaming is a thing so perhaps thats not for you) and there are many many apps that're very specific like the national parks have their own officially ran apps, theres Yelp, yada yada. Also, Americas road system is amazing at how paved everything is but American drivers are about as dumb as a Russian river.. get car insurance, you'll need it!

2633,"The thing is not only the numbers. 

Unlike /u/surfmaths I am an economist and I am not masturbating over figures.

But there is more to considerate when it comes to GDP growth than just the numbers. It is about how the economy is built, to evaluate the numbers. Momentarily the EU is (hopefully) heading out of one of the deepest recessions after the global financial crisis. 

So the economies are still in a recovery and finally boom, but this happens different for economies. The US and the UK is a bit the same. They have very liberal economics and working policies. 'Hire and Fire' isnt just a saying, it is practice. You find easily a job in the US, but in an economic crisis you get fired right away again. In France it is different. Youve got pretty strict policies to release workers from your company and so, they are more careful when they hire someone. 

So when an economy is growing again after a crisis, you have faster and higher numbers in economies with liberal work policies, as the risk for a company is pretty small. But for economies like France it is just heavier to get back on track, even if they recover after a crisis. 

It is also a big question where does the GDP growth come from. For example has China around 7-8% GDP growth in the last few years. Beside, that most economists doesnt beleive this figures, the GDP growth is heavily debt or state financed. The private debts in China are astronomically. The chinese state hasnt very high debts, but they invest large sums into their economy. 

So the GDP growth in China isnt mainly because the economy is really growing. It isnt because of heavy inventions or a good domestic market. It is because the state is doing putting money into it. The same was for a long time with france. The state quote is very very high. So while France has a strong domestic market, it is financed by the state. 

But all these points, regarding to France, are a bit shifting with Macron as President. He put new policies in place regarding work safety, state quote, pension and so on. So the GDP growth get higher recognition than usually, even with smaller numbers in absolute.

Also you shouldnt forget one thing ... the EU, way back in it roots, is based on the German-French Friendship after WWII. It is said, that these two states (with the Benelux) are the core of the EU.

2673,"&gt; In October, the Swedish Migration Agency granted citizenship to 1,205 British nationals, according to fresh statistics. That means 4,120 Brits have so far become Swedish citizens this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;This was already a record when [The Local reported](http://www.thelocal.se/20190902/record-number-of-brits-become-swedish-citizens-but-hundreds-are-still-waiting) on the rush for citizenship in September (the figure then stood at 2,406), as the Migration Agency attempted to fast-track applications ahead of Brexit.  
&gt;  
&gt;The agency said at the time that they were unable to prioritize Brits as a national group, but [were prioritizing all cases related to Brexit](https://www.thelocal.se/20190902/record-number-of-brits-become-swedish-citizens-but-hundreds-are-still-waiting), with fully completed applications dealt with first.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Migration Agency has, since this spring, a general decision in place which states that matters related to a possible Brexit should be prioritized so that processing times can be kept in accordance with our service commitments,"" spokesperson Johanna Måhlén [told The Local in September.](https://www.thelocal.se/20190902/record-number-of-brits-become-swedish-citizens-but-hundreds-are-still-waiting)  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes Brits the second-largest group of international residents who have been given Swedish citizenship this year, after Syrians (24,740 new Swedish citizens between January 1st and November 1st this year), but before applicants from Afghanistan (2,264) and Somalia (3,069).",,/r/europe/comments/dsuxn3/new_record_4120_brits_have_become_swedish/f6rqcnz/,Robi_damian,1573115527

2684,"&gt;So whats your solution then? Keep migrants out, let the german society get older and older and die out?  
&gt;  
&gt;We are (almost) at full employment and migrants are doing most of the work germans don't really want to do (cleaning, health care, ...). Who should do these jobs then?  
&gt;  
&gt;I agree that the statistic results are worrisome. In my opinion the solution is not to keep them out (because we actually need people that want to work) and integrate/educate them better.

But that makes their personal debt against society even higher, ergo they need to work more and pay more tax to offset the cost of their integration/education costs.

A solution would be to make refugee shelter and all the education a personal debt to refugees that want to stay, and have them pay it off for the rest of their life. Like a student debt.

Society still has to write off money, but it will be partially recouped by the people working the rest of their lives to pay it off if they stay.

Also at many supermarkets it takes the personnel 1 or 2 seconds to give the cash back as they are very fast in counting and often have the change ready faster than the customer can give them the banknote.

What does this have to do with my point, though? My issue lies with clickbait in the title.

&gt; You say you used to be an academic. Do you seriously have that stance?

Hell yeah. Our discussion is like a PhD retired for nigh on 30 years writing clickbait about stellarators for a popsci journal, then someone defending him on the basis of the author having been in the field 30 years in the past.

&gt; I don't pretend to know anything about other fields (unlike you), so I don't know the formats in the field of nuclear fusion science, but articles such as the OP are also an important part of social sciences.

Most physics articles containing original research are structured like this:

* a title summarizing the topic to let the reader know if this should interest them,

* an entry section to describe the importance and application of the research to expand on the title, provide necessary references for the reader to bring themselves up to speed, and not waste the reader's time in case the article isn't what they're looking for,

* a detailed description of methodology and resulting observations to let other teams replicate and double-check the research,

* analysis of the observations.

In an overview of a select field of research, the third and fourth parts have to do with others' articles in the field, rather than original research. My problem here is that the title and introduction in this article talk about topics that the body of the article leave aside. That's it. I'm not even talking about the article's validity, that's your worry for some reason.

2807,"Google doesn't turn up anything anything for ""factors analysis illegal immigrants united kingdom"".

I'd guess that you're right as to language:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language

&gt; 24 million (2016)[1]; Total (L1 plus L2 speakers): 29 million (2018)[2][3]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands

&gt; Population: 17,336,891 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders

&gt;Population: 6,444,127

Almost all of the Dutch speakers in the world look to already be in either Flanders or the Netherlands.

Plus ease of operating in the UK under the radar:

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43949972

&gt;The UK is one of only three EU countries that does not issue identity cards to its nationals, the other two are Denmark and the Republic of Ireland.
&gt;
&gt;Identity cards are mandatory in 16 countries.

Plus [sampling bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias).  Illegal immigrants to the UK need to make it past a controlled border or twenty-plus mile-wide strip of ocean.  They're going to come through France or the Netherlands, and they can be seen.  Illegal immigrants to the Netherlands don't go through the UK...and, frankly, they can probably stay below the radar a lot more easily since once they're in Schengen, they can just travel around like anyone else.

So you probably can't see illegal immigrants going to the Netherlands, and certainly not via the UK.

[United States](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/18_1214_PLCY_pops-est-report.pdf)

&gt; In  summary,  DHS  estimates  that  12.0  million  illegal  aliens  were living in the United States in January 2015

So ~3.7% of the population of the US.

[Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_Canada)

&gt;A federal government draft report from 2001 included an estimate of 100,000 illegal immigrants then residing in Canada.[13]

So ~0.03% of the population of Canada.

&gt;A federal government draft report from 2001 included an estimate of 100,000 illegal immigrants then residing in Canada.[13]

[United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom)

&gt;Although it is difficult to measure how many people reside in the UK without authorisation, a Home Office study based on Census 2001 data released in March 2005 estimated a population of between 310,000 and 570,000.[1] 

So 0.5% to 0.8% of the UK.

[Netherlands](https://leidenlawblog.nl/articles/not-making-it-in-the-netherlands-excluding-irregular-immigrants-to-the-max)

&gt; In the Netherlands, the debate is about an estimated 200 beds in a population of 16 million official inhabitants and an estimated 100,000 irregular migrants.

So 0.6% of the Netherlands.  That's actually not far off the actual UK numbers.

2866,"&gt; I don't see why being European would be relevant in this context 

Germany is relaxed about being flooded with Ukrainians but not with turks. That's why they get along with the 2017 visa free access for Ukraine.

&gt; Moreover, most people wanting to live in Germany wish to do it legally.

That's the point of getting visa-free access. Moving there to look for jobs. It also makes direct recruitment by work agencies a lot easier.

&gt; Being legal in Turkey is still much better than being an illegal in Europe.

My guess is that you're still probably above-average for a turk, given your English fluency. English fluency in turkey is still comparably low. The question is, is it better for a turk working menial jobs (Construction, street sweeper etc) to live illegally in germany? Most likely is, especially given the huge diaspora support network he or she can tap into. Harder for countries without such networks.

2887,"Demagogues like Hungary’s Viktor Orban denounce the European Union but corruptly exploit its farm subsidies.

What is galling is how openly Prime Minister Viktor Orban does it, blaming the European Union for every imagined indignity or interference in Hungary’s affairs, while milking billions from Brussels to enrich his cronies and prop up his illiberal rule. He is not alone, as a Times investigation of the bloc’s lavish farm subsidies demonstrates in shocking detail — the governments of several formerly Communist Eastern European states have also cynically taken advantage of the union’s largess through opaque deals, feeding a new class of land barons.

Perhaps even more galling is that the European Union knows all this, but prefers not to see or hear about the corruption for fear of upsetting the precarious bonds that hold the union together. One of the cardinal rules of the bloc is to defer to national leaders as much as possible to avoid just the sort of charges of infringing on national sovereignty that populist leaders across Europe, and Brexiteers in Britain, are so fond of making.

Yet the Common Agricultural Policy, a mainstay of the union from its founding, is the biggest item in its central budget, accounting for about 40 percent of expenditures, or about $65 billion. Its mechanisms and focus have been regularly challenged and altered, but the fundamental notion of protecting the rural way of life has remained at its heart.

Without effective oversight, however, the funds allotted to the bloc’s newest members — all provided by European taxpayers — have often become a lavish slush fund for political insiders, helping them amass wealth and consolidate power. The examples cited in the Times study are appalling — in the Czech Republic, the prime minister, Andrej Babis, is a billionaire whose companies collected at least $42 million in agricultural subsidies last year. In Bulgaria, the Academy of Science has found that 100 entities collect three-quarters of the main type of the union’s agricultural subsidies. In Slovakia, the top prosecutor has acknowledged the existence of an “agricultural Mafia,” and a journalist investigating the infiltration of the farm industry by Italian mobsters was murdered last year.

And, of course, Hungary, where Mr. Orban arranged for political allies and family members to buy up land owned by the former Communist nation and to collect rich European Union subsidies on it. Then at political rallies, he assails the European Union for seeking to strip away farm aid and use the money to bring in migrants.

There are many reasons that crony capitalism has found fertile soil in former Communist countries, not least among them a cavalier attitude toward defrauding the state that was prevalent in the secretive, centralized systems of the Soviet bloc. Leaders like Mr. Orban have also exploited a widespread sense in Central and East European societies of being patronized and ignored by the richer democracies to their west, and of being pushed toward socially progressive attitudes that still seem alien and decadent in the East. This makes it easy for populist politicians to depict European Union policies as the successor to Communist diktat while treating its handouts as their due, an approach similar to that of American conservatives who rail against “socialism” but regard ethanol credits or the oil depletion allowance as their entitlement.

But the European Union’s see-no-evil approach to the misuse of billions in taxpayer funds is an unnecessary, patronizing and self-defeating concession to the new members. It’s a payoff to corrupt leaders to keep them in the European camp even as they blithely defy the bloc’s policies on immigration, rule of law and corruption.

The story in The Times of Jozsef Angyan, who formerly worked with Mr. Orban in the mistaken belief that they shared the goal of helping small farmers, is instructive. Mr. Angyan at first helped Times reporters with their investigation, then stopped returning their calls. “How should I continue when nobody is behind me?” he told an acquaintance.

Yet instead of standing behind reformers like Mr. Angyan, European Union officials regularly reject efforts to make the subsidy system more accountable and transparent. The officials actively concealed data sought by the Times reporters, claiming either that it didn’t exist or that it was too cumbersome to produce, and anxiously kept tabs on the investigation.

The response of the union’s officials, once the Times investigation was published, was that their job was not to do the work of national governments, and that they were “acting precisely within our powers.” That may be, given current rules, but it should not prevent European Union commissioners and legislators from raising questions about how public funds are distributed and seeking rules that would address the worst abuses.

It may not be the job of the European Union to run member countries, but neither should the union be in the business of propping up rulers who deliberately subvert the purpose of its subsidies.",,/r/europe/comments/dst6zt/eastern_europes_populist_scam/f6rigpm/,PopKaro,1573105222

3075,"You are missing a few important factors.

If a person highly influential in their party becomes the head of state while their party has high degree of control over the parliament, they could easily make a power grab that would be impossible for a constitutional monarch under any circumstances. Electing a head of state through democracy has the disadvantage of the person still being tied into the party politics of their country, meaning that with some exceptions they can often be a head of state just for the people who voted for them, but disregard the stances held by others. That problem doesn't exist when the position is held by a person who is not allowed to show any political favoritism.

A representative who in their very person represents centuries of their nation's history and has so little power that it's nearly impossible for a corrupt one to fuck up more than a corrupt politician of a lower rank, yes. Frankly, my main problem with the system is inheritance, but I'm afraid putting a person in such a position through democratic means would inevitably lead to the position becoming involved in party politics, and by that point you could just have a normal president. And I don't think there were really other methods of choice in Europe in the past few centuries, at least none that I would have heard of.

3239,"Széchenyi was an aristocrat who took a prominent part in the modernisation of Hungary in the first half of the XIX. century. He is most known from the fact that he was one of the main architects of the Hungarian Scientific Academy, he donated his one year income for the cause.

He founded multiple successful transporting corporations, and in the 1848 government he became Minister of Transportation. He received the *epitheton ornans* ""the greatest Hungarian"" from his biggest political rival, Kossuth Lajos. After the Croatian invasion started in September, he went mad, and attempted suicide because he felt himself responsible for the bloodshed. After the war he more or less regained his mental health for a while, but in the end he committed suicide in 1860 after the harassments of the imperial police.

Deák was a lawyer from a moderately wealthy family. He received the epithet ""the sage of the motherland"". Say what you will from Kossuth, but he knew how to flatter his political enemies. 

Deák took a prominent role in the formulation of the April laws in 1848, and also was a Minister of Justice in the Batthyány-cabinet. He resigned in September, and stayed at home for the rest of the war. He was the prominent leader of the Hungarian opposition after the war, and the main engineer of the 1867 compromise.

3283,"Ekrem Imamoglu can hardly be considered a traditional Kemalist. He is a bit more of a conservative compared to a Kemalist in some ways though he is more of a progressive in some other areas compared to a Kemalist as well. So he is hard to label in terms of modern politics. Though we can safely say he is more of a left compared to a nationalist. Him winning the election and his way of talking actually ignited many discussion in Turkey with questions like ""Is political left and right distinction dying?"". So instead of kemalist he may be more of a center, center-left or center-right in the political spectrum depending on your views.


Well I can't talk about other countries but for Ekrem Imamoglu's case it wasn't nationalism or anti-immigrant policies that made him win. Those may have played some part but what made him win was him being able to connect with people from all over the political spectrum during a time where everyone is highly polarized. He made sure that AKP supporters never see him as a threat, him getting elected wouldn't change their way of life. He promised he would be a mayor for everyone, no matter what their views, beliefs, gender etc. This was refreshing to see for everyone especially in a time where people are sick of political fights so it worked.


Also his opposition was the main ""nationalist"" even supported by Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in the elections.

3288,"&gt;First of all, there's a big dollop of self-victimisation by companies who very willingly transferred all their technology, together with their production facilities, to China in order to exploit the cheap labor and lax regulations

This is not what happened. The IP was stolen at a facility in Taiwan by a Taiwanese national, a country with a strong rule of law. It was then forwarded to the Chinese SOE from that individual. 

The US Department of Justice has since filed criminal charges against the individual which further supports Micron's assertians. Criminal charges have a higher standard of proof, and the DOJ does not typically bring charges unless they have a strong likelihood of success. 

If Micron moved all it's manufacturing and IP to China to save money I would agree, but that is not what has happened here. 

&gt;Secondly, Chinese universities now churn out hundreds of thousands of well-trained engineers each year: it's more than a bit presumptuous (or worse) to think that they can only progress by copying ""our"" ideas

It has to do with everyday usage. The kinds of word which you use everyday are entirely Germanic. You might use the term “hydropower” to describe a power plant that uses water, but every time you fill a pot up in your kitchen or wash your hands you’ll refer to the “water” that is coming out of the sink. 


There’s also a lot of garbage words in the dictionary which are Latin based but never actually used. Like “coquetry” is a word you might see in books about 19th century romantic novels about English aristocrats, but nobody would ever use that word unless they were being ironic. The normal word is “flirting”.


And a great deal of the terminology is just Latin based because it involves things which developed in the last 200 years.

However, in the 1960s Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov made the following conclusions about the relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages: a) Proto-Slavic language formed from the peripheral-type Baltic dialects; b) Slavic linguistic type formed later from the Baltic languages structural model; c) the Slavic structural model is a result of the Baltic languages structural model transformation. This model is supported by glottochronologic studies by V. V. Kromer, although both of the most recent computer-generated family trees have a Baltic node parallel to the Slavic node.

This whole discussion was about practicality. Currently, there is no way to turn energy into real world objects or materials. Discussing this without a realistic implementation timeline bears no merit.

&gt; The opposite process of matter to energy conversion is an everyday event in nuclear reactors, as is transmutation.

This is what turns limited resources into expendable ones. Besides wood and any other such materials, all other elements like gold and platinum are not only rare but also expendable.

&gt; all of the plutonium in use is produced through transmutation

You still need raw materials, like uranium, which is expendable, for the nuclear reaction to actually take place for the transmutation to happen.

Our real problem is energy storage. And we have to solve this. But once we have a way to store energy, that wind and solar are not steady sources daily/weekly doesn't matter anymore, as the yearly output is pretty much constant.

And we need storage because of heating in winter, it doubles the energy requirement in France (electric heating is common there) compared to summer.

This myth again. Growth is going to be perpetual, as long as there exists a physical possibility of optimising productivity; this includes being more efficient with materials, recycling, etc. If someone would find a way to recycle all products 100% at a low cost, it would speed up production and consumption of durable goods, too. 

&gt;maybe, just maybe, some people are reconsidering buying that second car after hearing all the climate change concerns that have been put forth in the last years and the emissions scandals that may have had something to do with them

Numbers of cars per capita is still increasing, its just that multiple factors caused a temporary reduction of buying *new* cars. Older cars are lasting longer than ever, so the only way to reduce number of cars on the road (temporarily) would be for the government to go into a rather rapid gradual ban of ICE vehicles, which obviously is not in the cards because of adverse social effects.","Yes, the evil Kalergi plan",/r/europe/comments/dscwlj/german_manufacturing_stuck_in_recession_factory/f6ozh3t/,Jabadabaduh,1573042353

&gt; I am going to excuse your mistake regarding his biography

No you're not, I drew my conclusions from that very wiki page. ""Pavel Kimovich Baev &lt;...&gt; is a Norwegian political scientist and security scholar"", born in Russia, who ""worked in the newly created Institute of Europe in Moscow until 1992, when he moved to Oslo, Norway"".

Oh, if he works in an echo chamber, that explains a few things.

&gt; The man worked in Soviet institutions and finished his education there, so he has very unique insight.

Into Soviet institutions.

&gt; probably better insight than yours, despite you also being Russian

Hell yeah. I'm Russian, I don't know much about Soviet life and its intricacies. The author of this article, however, hasn't been in touch with local reality in 27 years.

&gt; saying that the title is bad or an indicator of the quality just shows your inexperience with the format

Once again, the article and its title have different messages put into them. That's not what an academic paper does, my man, I can tell you that much after writing a couple of pieces on nuclear fusion back in my to-be PhD days. If anything, academic research, which you apparently claim this to be, is way more dry and down to the facts than modern news is.

3847,"Sorry, but this is just plain stupid.

First off, we cannot multiply indefinitely and everybody with half a brain cell should realize this. There is an equilibrium and we've gone far, far beyond it. We need to shrink human populations, humanely. Touting the dogma of ""go out and multiply"" is anti-humane in the long term.

Second, this scarecrow of aging populations is made-up bullshit. Yes, the population boom from the 50s will mean an increased proportion of the elderly, but they will eventually pass on and the population tree will assume its original proportion (i.e. more young people at the bottom).

What happened was a sharp increase of the living standard, health care and longevity, starting in the 30s. This was not accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the number of children conceived and born per couple and so there was a spike. 2 children per couple are now perfectly sufficient to maintain population.

Thirdly, the old pension arrangements will need to be reviewed. People no longer die when they are 60ish in a totally frail and run-down condition. 70year-olds nowadays are capable of functioning normally. They might just have to. In other words, we get to live an easy life, but we can't expect any free ticket just because of age anymore.

3905,"&gt;This development will have a significant impact on the health system, education, pensions and other sectors of the Greek economy, he warned.

-

&gt;Warning that Greece must take measures now in order to avoid this scenario of an aging population, he highlighted two measures which can be taken to limit the phenomenon.
&gt;
&gt;The first would be to restrict the number of people leaving the country through incentives to combat the so-called “brain drain,” and the second is to create a more favorable environment, which would include an array of incentives for having children.

I have, in the past, pointed out that the EU in aggregate benefits from possessing a mobile labor force.  People moving from where there is a good deal of labor relative to demand to somewhere where there is not makes the EU overall better-off.  If EU members are not willing to compensate members who are on the net losing population to destination members, that this creates a perverse incentive for individual EU members to limit labor mobility, as this Greek professor of demographics is proposing.  This is economically-damaging to the EU as a whole.  I've argued before that EU members should ""pool"" funds for their programs, or transfer funds to source members.  The US currently does this via Social Security and federal (higher-level) education and healthcare subsidies.  Thus, when someone moves from one state to another, they don't break social services that rely on moving wealth between generations.

Note that a pool does *not* need entail that the EU simply must have the same level of services across the whole EU.  It doesn't mean that tomorrow, the EU must pay the same amount of pension to EU citizens everywhere, which -- whatever the merits of such a policy -- would also transfer a good deal of wealth away from the wealthy EU members and probably make them worse-off for being in the EU.  But at the least, if the EU is to have freedom of movement of labor, it seems to me that it should not make members that raise children that benefit the EU and then -- economically-efficiently -- move elsewhere in the EU *worse-off* for having done so.

3942,"You don't think to have a good understanding of the physical limits of our world and have just a vague idea that technology will fix everything. There is absolutely no indication that it will be the case.

Take transportation. There is no replacement to fossil fuels for aviation. For cars we have electric cars, but they have numerous problems: 1) electric cars only make sense in countries where electricity is mostly carbon free such as France or Switzerland; 2) there is not enough materials on earth to build enough batteries to replace all cars; 3) the production of electric cars itself creates a lot of CO2.

Take electricity. Nuclear energy is carbon free and could be a solution but there is not enough uranium on earth to replace all electricity by nuclear. Plus there are huge resistances against nuclear. If you take renewables like sun and wind, the main problem is that they only work when it's sunny and windy. You could aboid this problem with batteries but see my point for cars. Otherwise you need some other source of energy for the periods without wind or sun. Germany, a pioneer of renewables, plans to also build a new coal power plant.

I dont know why people think Midwesterners are casual about their racism, as if calling black people criminal thugs or niggers is just a common and accepted fact of life in the Midwest.  It really isnt.  The city I live in has a sizable black population.  I work with a lot of black people.  Overt racism just isnt acceptable here.  Sure, some small towns with a lot of farmers might have some openly racist people, but they represent a small fraction of the overall demographics. 

I had a friend who lived in a wealthy and predominantly white area of California, the type if place which would lecture middle America on how racist and hateful they are.  I noticed it was full of rich white people with barely a black person in sight.  These are the type of people who have no real experience with black people, their lecturing comes from a place of vanity, a sad attempt to appear virtuous without any real action. 

As a white, working class man, I interact with black people as equals, and they treat me the same way.   We all know we are in this socio-economic group together.  I dont treat them as victims because they have a similar life to me, their skin color matters far less than their economic status.  Some rich and guilt ridden white people feel that they can atone for racism by bossing around lower class whites and shaming them. In reality, they are often far more racist than white people who interact with working class black people every day.  I am not afraid to criticize black people because they criticize me.

4159,"They are often remembered in different streets and at least I got taught about them when I grew up and got taught about Nazis first. My mom made sure I heard about them.

The important detail about this is that the German Bundeswehr has huge problems working through that dark age of the world wars and so on, because obviously they are seen (and disliked) as the successors of the Wehrmacht, an army that commited war crimes and fought and supported the might of the Nazi-Regime. They were trying to reinstate certain generals like for example Rommel and named baracks after them. 

Basically the whole army has had an identity crisis through the last 70 years. It was a little bit better since it was an army of citizens, which could keep the general opinion in the baracks, but nowadays (maybe also because people aren't forced into the army anymore) the Bundeswehr is struggling with a ton of controversies. Women being treated horribly, horrendous punishments and traditions and there was the case of a soldier whistle blowing about quite a lot of Nazis in his baracks and he got removed! Plus weapons are getting lost and are reappearing in the Reichsbürger-movement (People that want to reinstate the old German Empire and say the republic is not justified + there was never a peace treaty, so conspiracy theorists, but violent ones) and there was also an underground terrorist organization in the making either in the army or the police (can't remember right now). 

So there's a lot of problems in the German executive force (army and police) with right-wing nuts and Nazis. It is really scary. So such a sign is pretty important in my eyes and I hope that there are more changes on the way.

4212,"&gt; You absolutely do not know any of that with certainty. 

Nobody knows exactly how things would have played out but the inital results are widely accepted among all economists. 

- Greeces banking system folds and wipes out all savings and working capital of companies. Payments can no longer be processes and all economic activity halts. 

- With Greece having defaulted on its debt many pension companies fold as well as their capital stock (consisting on many government bonds) is wiped out.

- Greece exits the Euro and introduces a new currency to recapitalize its banking sector. This currency depreciated strongly against all other currencies.

- Given that Greece defaulted on its debt international markets are now closed to it meaning it has to immediately balance the budget i.e. cut spending by the equivalent of 10-14% of GDP.

All of the above combined would have been absolutely apocalyptic for Greece. I'm certain its GDP would have crashed even harder than under the IMF plan. The only issue is whether or not it would have recovered after an initial 3-5 year shock.

4283,"&gt; It's a can of worms. If you constitutionally permit the use of a weapon in the defense of another or self, then you're inviting the constitutional court to decide over matters of gun use 

The constitution already includes the right to defend your life, but some countries decided to take away any means to do so. This would pretty much be clarification of that issue.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That would be completely random and unprecedented. But even if, they can just as easily demand we remove the bit from the constitutional wording. Lisbon treaty is superior and all that. 

They can demand we remove the from our constitution but it would take much more work. And then they still have to justify forcing us to change our constitution AND at the same time breach the Treat of Lisbon by meddling in our internal security.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Or if that's your argument, then we can just blanket ban all guns with the justification that there are many other weapons available for use. But that would run counter to your aims, wouldn't it? 

You cant really do that, you need a very good reason to just ban something, at least thats how our legal system works. You could also counter that while there are many other weapons available, not all of them offer the same utility. We dont just decide to ban SUVs because someone had an accident like Germany does.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And just what would the constitutional court do against the EU? It only rules if something violates the constitution or not. It doesn't refgulate the contents of the constitution itself, those can be changed at any time.

*Article 4*

1.   In accordance with Article 5, competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States.

2.   The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security. In particular, national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State.

Legally you'd probably not even be required to list those ingredients simply because they're not present anymore, assuming the homeopath properly cleaned their equipment.

4439,"I'm just gonna quote wikipedia on this

&gt;Civic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a ""civic nation"" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.

&gt;The central theme of ethnic nationalists is that ""nations are defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a common language, a common faith, and a common ethnic ancestry"". It also includes ideas of a cultureshared between members of the group, and with their ancestors.

The line between this things isn't clear cut, and often a group containing civic nationalists will attract ethnic nationalists and vice versa. The Scottish nationalist party, despite being a civic nationalist party is definetly home to a few people who utterly detest the english, on a racial level. 

The ethnic nationalism is synonymous with oppressors comes from the fact that ethnic nationalism usually devolves into racial superiority and hence the inferiority and oppression of other peoples. The conflation of oppressed (I use the term loosely) and civic nationalists might just be a UK thing, because coincidentally both our civic nationalist parties are seeking indepdance for historically subservient areas, but I wouldn't want to hypothesise without a basis to do so.",Wales,/r/europe/comments/drixeh/the_political_map_of_scotland_2010present/f6mrmmw/,Alvald,1572977508

Yes. Germany and Denmark have two of the most secure electricity supplies in Europe, but also have gross import shares higher than other neighboring countries.

They don't have to.

&gt;  biomass - so lets convert every field to grow fuel for biogass. We dont need food anyway.

Plenty of fuel crops don't compete with food crops, and most food crops aren't meant for human consumption anyway. Biofuels don't pose any risk to our food supply, but they do pose a risk to the meat industry. Which —if you care about reducing emissions— is a good thing anyway.

&gt;  alternative generation methods - what should I imagine under this

It means relying on a mixed portfolio of renewable generation methods, so as to reduce overall variability.

&gt; So, so far not good, things you suggested are either already done, wont work, or it is just words which sound good but there is nothing behind them.

It's very easy —but also very ignorant or very dishonest— to assess each of those factors in isolation and then dismiss them for being individually insufficient.

That's a massive problem. If you can petition the constitutional court in this matter, then that's  a massive problem for the judicial system. A constitutional court cannot be overruled by a higher court, because there is none and the results linger for decades. 

&gt; Because if its done that way, it will be much harder for the EU to require us to remove that bit about internal security.

That would be completely random and unprecedented. But even if, they can just as easily demand we remove the bit from the constitutional wording. Lisbon treaty is superior and all that.

&gt; Besides the amendment talks about WEAPONS, not just guns, those 2 words have different meanings. While almost all guns are weapons, not all weapons are guns.

But we all know that this isn't about regulating the use of knitting needles or broken bottles for self defence. You can dress a pig however you want, but it won't make it a princess. 

Or if that's your argument, then we can just blanket ban all guns with the justification that there are many other weapons available for use. But that would run counter to your aims, wouldn't it?

Acid attacks have actually become quite popular with white supremacists in the UK.

So of your 800 acid attacks in 2017, 48 were committed by Middle Eastern/Pakistanis.

&gt;For the same period (2002-16), 'White Europeans' comprised 32% of suspects, and African Caribbeans 38% of suspects. About one in five suspects remain unknown – either because they can’t be identified, or because the victim has refused to identify them.

4621,"Doesn't disprove what I'm saying. The net flow of capital to CZ is positive and has been so since the early 90s. At worst, it is balanced.

As the report states ""in the Czech Republic EUR 29 billion were repatriated and EUR 23 billion were invested between 2014 and 2016"" : add to that the EU funds of around 2bn/y and even considering the worst case (higher dividends, lower new FDI) scenario, the flow of capital into CZ is balanced.

What I don't understand is the complaining about this FDI: this is detrimental to most of the people in the West (not the rich ones who are making the investment) and a positive to the people in the receiving countries.

I'm not against it, as it helps the economies catch up faster and I'm all for that (and I'm well off myself, so, eh...) but hearing these complaints about receiving masses of capital from the beneficiaries is strange.

Like the complaint on the economy being fully employed. This is a great way to increase wages. It's just weird.

France was really happy about getting massive funding from the mid-1800s from the UK to build up its rail. Russia was overjoyed at getting massive funding from France in the late 1800s to build up its rail.

4622,"I don't know what people here expect. You can't just throw a switch and turn of all fossil fuel plants at once. Old plants get decommissioned and have to be replaced, and as was pointed out, this has been in the plans for decades. 

""Go nuclear!"" I hear reddit armchair experts exclaim. There are however obstacles which make it simply not viable. First, there is no support in the local population. It's irrational but good luck trying to change their opinion. Second, building new nuclear plants takes very long, 10 years at least. For example in the UK Hinkley Point C project was started in 2008 and is still not finished. Third, at this point renewables are simply more economical. You can build an offshore wind park in two years, there is less risk involved and your investment is returned faster.

So what can be done? The biggest challenges currently are the grid and storage. Renewable energy is produced in the north and consumed in the south. The are plans for high power transmission lines, but again, those take time to built.

Grid level storage is what is really lacking behind. There are currently a couple of pilot projects, including batteries, pressurized air, and heat storage, but nothing at large scale. This is where I feel we must invest a lot more.

That's exactly how the US' obsession with guns started. A constitutional amendment is hard to revoke as it tend to require a large majority, and interpretations of a vague rule change over time. In the US this was certainly for the worse, as the amendment was written in a time of political division fought with highly inaccurate guns loaded by the bullet.

Although I don't have numbers, I highly doubt making more guns available to the public, regardless of checks, have ever made a country safer. It does certainly lead to more guns in circulation though.

5011,"While the share of renewable energies passed the 40% mark in 2018, a brand new coal-fired power plant is due to come on stream in Germany in 2020.
Energy producer Uniper will be able to connect its brand new coal-fired power plant in Datteln in North Rhine-Westphalia to the grid in 2020, government and industry sources reported a few days ago in Germany, according to Reuters.

Costing €1.5 billion, this site has a production capacity of 1100 MW. It can supply electricity to up to 100,000 households. While its construction has been delayed, the plant should never have been commissioned as part of Germany's plan to abandon coal as an energy source by 2038 at the latest. Uniper, its operator, should then have been compensated for its huge investment in this site, explains Reuters.

Its CO2 emissions are reportedly lower, according to the authorities
But this compensation is no longer on the agenda because the authorities consider that the newly designed Datteln 4 site would have lower CO2 emissions than older coal-fired power plants.

According to a German government source, ""Datteln 4 can enter into service"". The exact date of this commissioning has not yet been revealed, as it is expected to take place in the first half of 2020, at the latest next summer.

Coal and lignite: 38% of German energy production in 2018
The connection to the electricity grid of a new and powerful coal-fired power plant will take place at a time when Germany has crossed the symbolic threshold of 40% in 2018 for the share of renewable energies in national energy production (source: Fraunhofer Institute of Applied Sciences). By comparison, in 2018, coal energy represented 131.28 TWh (24.1%) and lignite-based energy 75.71 TWh (13.9%), for a total of 38% for these fossil fuels whose combustion is considered particularly polluting.

A few weeks ago, the operator of the Uniper coal-fired power plant was the subject of a financial takeover by the Finnish energy producer Fortum. Fortum acquired an additional 20.5% stake in Uniper for €2.3 billion and its stake in Uniper increased to 70.5%. Uniper also sold this summer to the Czech group EPH, the two French coal-fired power plants it operated in Saint-Avold (Moselle) and Gardanne (Bouches-du-Rhône).

In France, the Multi-annual Energy Programme (MEP) provides for the closure of the last four coal-fired power plants by 2022",France,/r/europe/comments/drwbn5/germany_will_commission_a_brand_new_coalfired/f6lfkss/,sysnot,1572942156

This is really naive thinking, as I have already explained above and based on the fact that outside EU the government’s aren’t restricting robocalls at all.

&gt;By leaving the EU, the UK has full control of the law. They are not governed by a foreign entity whom they have no control over.

The European Parliament is directly elected by the people of Europe. This is really basic knowledge....

And the UK has been fully capable of implementing a law like this, as it doesn’t go against any EU directives, (which are really fair btw).

And yes, the UK will get full control over it’s laws, if no deal brexit happens. But seeing as the UK government banned it. The UK won’t gain control over it’s laws, like Norway or Switzerland, but instead will lose control over the laws it has to follow and truly have no power as you said.

Brexit is the UK shooting itself in the foot and there is no other way of putting for any sane person who is capable logical thinking.


&gt;The choice is simple. Do you want to be governed by the EU and the UK or simply the UK? Don't forget, you don't get to choose the governing body of the EU but you still have to pay EU taxes and follow EU laws and regulations.

Many war crimes have been perpetrated by the United States and the European governments that foolishly went along with Washington. Millions of refugees have had to leave their homes, which has also sparked a migrant crisis in Europe that has destabilized the established political order and fueled the rise of the far right. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 inevitably led to a spillover in Syria, and the destruction of Syria is very much linked to what happened in Iraq during the 2000s. The outbreak of sectarian wars in Iraq and Syria intensified a cold war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, who have been competing for influence in Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, Afghanistan, Bahrain and elsewhere. 

Prior to all of this, Iraq was on a path towards development and modernization set by the progressive Ba'ath Party, which encouraged unity for all of Iraq's ethnic groups and practiced separation of church and state. Iraqi Christians, a group of people that all Europeans should be concerned about, prospered and were protected during the Baathist leadership. Revolutionary-democratic forces like the Baathists in Iraq and Syria, Arab Socialist Union in Egypt, and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya offered resistance and opposition to despotic, aristocratic regimes like in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, but the United States and Europeans stuck with the latter group of countries because the former countries couldn't be subjugated.",,/r/europe/comments/drm26c/netherlands_admits_killing_up_to_70_civilians_in/f6laljh/,ConsciousBook,1572935195

Ah, couldn't remember the term -- yeah, dual mandate.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_mandate

&gt; A member of the European Parliament (MEP) may not be a member of the legislature of a member state.[1] This dates from a 2002 European Union decision, which came into effect at the 2004 European elections in most member states,[1] at the 2007 national election in the Republic of Ireland,[1] and at the 2009 European elections in the United Kingdom.[1]
&gt;
&gt; Originally, MEPs were nominated by national parliamentarians from among their own membership.[2] Prior to the first direct elections in 1979, the dual mandate was discussed.[2] Some advocated banning it, arguing that MEPs who were national MPs were often absent from one assembly in order to attend the other[2] (indeed, the early death of Peter Michael Kirk was blamed by his election agent on overwork resulting from his dual mandate[3]). Others claimed that members with a dual mandate enhanced communication between national and European assemblies.[2] There was a particular interest in the dual mandate question in Denmark: Eurosceptic Danish Social Democrats supported a compulsory dual mandate, to ensure that the state's MEPs expressed the same views as the national legislature,[4] and the government of Denmark supported a compulsory dual mandate when the other eight member states supported an optional dual mandate.[5] However, a 1976 European Parliament law preparing for the 1979 elections expressly permitted a dual mandate.[6] In 1978 the German politician Willy Brandt suggested that one third of MEPs should be national MPs.[7]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dr1cld/nigel_farage_says_he_will_not_stand_for_mp_in/f6lbme6/,duisThias,1572936506

When Greek islands are close to Turkey the airspace boundary is simple the distance divided by two.

It's not made for long range offensive bombing, but tailor made to defend the local airspace from intruders - The main goal of most air forces. One of the main design goals was affordability and ease of maintenance.

 *Jane's Aerospace and Defense Consulting has done a cost analysis and  found that Sweden's Saab Gripen has the lowest operating costs of all  western jetfighters.*   
 

*“At an estimated $4,700 per hour (2012 USD), the Gripen compares  very favorably with the Block 40 / 50 F-16s which are its closest  competitor at an estimated $7,000 per hour,” says the report, adding,  “The F-35 and twin-engined designs are all significantly more expensive  per flight hour owing to their larger size, heavier fuel usage and  increased number of airframe and systems parts to be maintained and  repaired. IHS Jane’s believes that aircraft unit cost and size is  therefore roughly indicative of comparative CPFH.”*    
 

*In comparison, the figure for the F/A-18 Super Hornet ranged from  $11,000 to $24,000, depending on degree of operational capability. The  figure for the Rafale was $16,500 per flying hour and number for the  Eurofighter Typhoon, derived from British Parliamentary figures and  seeming to cover only fuel usage, was  $8,200. But Jane’s estimate of  the actual Cost Per Flying Hour for the Eurofighter, keeping in mind  supplies and scheduled maintenance raised the figure up to $18,000.*

""California Raisins"" are a trademark.  [Go back a couple decades and you can find a California Raisins video game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HycwVvscbkE).

The issue is that the term has become genericized in the US.  Once a term has been treated as non-owned-by-someone, we don't allow reclaiming it, else it creates perverse incentives to sit and wait until people adopt a term widely, then try to gain ownership.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_trademark

&gt;A generic trademark, also known as a genericized trademark or proprietary eponym, is a trademark or brand name that, because of its popularity or significance, has become the generic name for, or synonymous with, a general class of product or service, usually against the intentions of the trademark's holder. The process of a product's name becoming genericized is known as genericide.[1]
&gt;
&gt;A trademark is said to become genericized when it begins as a distinctive product identifier but changes in meaning to become generic. This typically happens when the products or services with which the trademark is associated have acquired substantial market dominance or mind share, such that the primary meaning of the genericized trademark becomes the product or service itself rather than an indication of source for the product or service. A trademark thus popularized has its legal protection at risk in some countries such as the United States and United Kingdom, as its intellectual property rights in the trademark may be lost and competitors enabled to use the genericized trademark to describe their similar products, unless the owner of an affected trademark works sufficiently to correct and prevent such broad use.[2][3][4]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/drndir/eu_and_china_strike_deal_to_protect_gourmet_food/f6kyvvj/,duisThias,1572924257

5340,"From 1801 to 1812, Lord Elgin, ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, removed about half of the Parthenon's friezes, as well as a large number of statues, from the Parthenon in Greece (then under Ottoman control). Elgin claimed to have acted in accordance with an Ottoman decree that allowed him to do so. The veracity of this decree is disputed, as an original has never been found in Ottoman archives. This is despite the fact that available archives from that period are well-furnished. 

Elgin's actions were controversial even in his time, with many, such as Lord Byron, accusing him of looting and vandalism. Calls for the return of the marbles have existed pretty much since Greek independence in 1832, and British control over them remain a sore point in the countries' relations to this day. 

The marbles are an important part of Greek national heritage, and carry a lot of symbolic value. It's a bit as if the Magna Carta had been acquired by another country through questionable means, and said country refused to give it back.

So in essence, the highest-ranking British diplomat in the Ottoman Empire removed art with a high historical significance, on at best legally questionable grounds. The acquisition of historical artefacts without regard for local sentiments was not exactly an uncommon practice in the 19th century. The fact that this case still caused a storm of controversy in a time of notorious insensivity to indigenous cultures underscores how egregious this case was, even within its historical context. 

Was it theft? I'd say so. One individual, working for the British government, took away important artefacts for his own gain, without payment, without permission from legal authorities, and certainly without permission from the local people. ""Unauthorised acquisition of goods"" makes a pretty good definition of theft, don't you think?

Protesting != acting as I said. 

I wish the west just protested against my country instead of implementing sanctions and bombing it. 

But they didn't. They took decisive action and didn't think twice about it.

&gt;... According to the people who escaped and the people who are currently protesting. You're defending a hypocritical regime here while pretending to be worried about Western hypocrisy, and have no regard for their victims whatsoever. You're not arguing against Western hypocrisy at all, you're just defending hypocrisy and human rights abuses by anything you perceive as not-the-West.

Are there no people who leave netherlands and then talk badly about it ? Should we believe them over the ones that stay and say ""it's nice"" ? Should we believe dutch nationalists who run away and say it's a shithole with immigrants now, rather than dutch 

&gt;Ah, so now it's about me personally and not the big bad west anymore? That doesn't make any sense.

Only because you're interpreting it personally. You in this case means ""The west"" , you are a part of it. It's nothing against you personally, which is evident since when you consider that ""you"" in this paragraph means the west, the paragraph makes sense, and when you consider it means you personally it doesn't. Personally I thought it was a dead giveaway, but hey.

You're falsely describing how the Chinese government supposedly operates according to you and then conclude they're not hypocritical. As much as you don't like it, that constitutes an argument and not a very good one.

I'm not, i'm showing how they operate and why it doesn't constitute hypocrisy. Why are you trying to change what I'm saying even if I in no unclear terms denied it ?

&gt;You should try to look at the world without a simplistic ""all West=only bad"" bias for once.

I don't. I believe that west is actually better than most of the world. That's the reason everyone wants to move there, and why it's the de facto standard for a good living.

5435,"&gt;It's no longer around is it ? And South Africa was kicked out of the club.

Which is my point exactly. 'The West' and those 'Western' organisations sanctioned South Africa which severely weakened it, while the country should by all means have been a great ally to them. 

&gt;Who's condemned ? Obama won a peace prize for bombing countless civilians. How is that ""condemned"" ? 

One organisation giving out a peace prize to Obama in 2009 doesn't magically mean other organisations haven't condemned Obama's drone strikes, or the Saudi ones, or the Chinese concentration camps, or the Libya intervention, or the Iraq war (which didn't get through the UNSC, remember?) or the inaction in Srebrenica and Rwanda, for example. 

&gt;And no they will never be accountable for their crimes, and it is a western thing. West is forcing others to be held accountable for their crimes , while calling it's own crimes ""mistakes"" and passing laws saying they can invade the international court if one of theirs ends up there.

The USA did, that's hardly the whole of the West, *especially* since many of its allies protested the law. 

&gt;Because they're powerful, which is what I'm arguing for. I'm arguing against the Western European elite being a bunch of hypocrites who expect everyone else to do what they say, while at least Chinese are honest about it. They don't mind if you mistakenly bomb a hospital, as long as it's not theirs. They don't pretend to be the ultimate moral guideline like the West.

You would not say the Chinese are a bunch of hypocrites? Are you serious? They're not being honest about their concentration camps or support for the North Korean government at all, and pretend as if it's all just one big prison full of criminals being 're-educated'. I'm quite appalled that you'd defend the Chinese here while riling against Western governments. Even if they're not worse, they're *certainly* not any better.

So when was the plebiscite conducted?

5445,"&gt; American gaming giants Mohegan and Hard Rock International will battle for the rights to build a casino on the site of the former Athens airport at Ellinikon, as part of an enormous resort on Attica’s coast.
&gt; 
&gt; Mohegan has proposed a futuristic-looking building, to be named “Inspire Athens,” which will have at least 120 gaming tables and 1,200 slot machines, as well as a luxury hotel, a conference center and a sports center.
&gt; 
&gt; It will also feature a jaw-dropping infinity-type swimming pool halfway to the top of the towers of the hotel.
&gt; 
&gt; Connecticut’s Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment Company, in collaboration with Greek contractor GEK Terna, is to battle against Florida’s Hard Rock International, The Hellenic Gaming Commission (HGC) stated as the bids were submitted at the October 4 deadline.
&gt; 
&gt; The Mohegan bid for the casino is reportedly approximately €1 billion ($1.1 billion) and is set to occupy approximately 15,000 square meters of the total 6,200,000 square-meter Ellinikon Project.
&gt; 
&gt; Mohegan sees the casino as part of a larger luxury resort. Besides the casino and hotel, the company will incorporate leisure facilities and top restaurants, as well as a concert venue and shopping center.
&gt; 
&gt; The complex will cater to all ages and provide entertainment options for the whole family for both Greek and foreign visitors and residents of the greater Athens area.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, Hard Rock International, which has also bid about €1 billion ($1.11 billion) for the casino license, with its extensive know-how and the specific profile of its international investments, seems to be focusing more on entertainment venues, which are typically part of large casino complexes.
&gt; 
&gt; The winner of the bidding process, who is expected to be named by the end of November, will build a casino of at least 1.2 hectares, with at least 120 gaming tables and 1,200 slot machines, as well as a luxury hotel, a conference center and a sports center.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Lamda Development, the firm that has undertaken the development of the entire Ellinikon area, the total cost of the gigantic development project is expected to be close to €8 billion ($9 billion).
&gt; 
&gt; The resort will also include convention facilities, entertainment shows, and theme parks, as well as luxury retail and fine dining. Offices, sports facilities, museums, and shopping malls are also in the plans for the gargantuan area, which was once the international airport of Athens.
&gt; 
&gt; The project will also feature cultural venues, health centers, educational and research facilities, a marina and other amenities that will make the former airport site its own city on the Athens Riviera.
&gt; 
&gt; The aim is to create the largest entertainment and casino complex in Eastern Europe and the Southeastern Mediterranean — and one of the largest in the world. The development is slated to also be one of Europe’s largest coastal resorts.
&gt; 
&gt; The Greek government, for its part, is determined to move ahead with the project as quickly as possible, with Development Minister Adonis Georgiadis often stressing that “Ellinikon will become a symbol of the country and its development.”
&gt; 
&gt; The resort and casino complex is expected to bring in hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, and be a major boost to the country’s economy, Georgiadis noted.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, the blueprints for the two proposed casino buildings have caused a storm of negative reactions in social media. Furthermore, several architects also criticized the designs, with comments such as “This is not architecture” or “They have nothing to do with the Greek landscape and are reminiscent of Las Vegas.”",Greece,/r/europe/comments/drp70l/hard_rock_and_mohegan_bidding_1_billion_each_to/f6k611b/,ThallassaGreece,1572905713

5450,"&gt; Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited the headquarters of the Chinese shipping giant Cosco in Shanghai on Monday, where he declared that their common goal “is to make Piraeus Port the largest port in Europe.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mitsotakis, who was accompanied by Cosco President Xu Lirong, was warmly greeted by Cosco employees who chanted slogans and held Greek and Chinese flags.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Chinese official praised the Greek premier for the quick approval of Cosco’s new investment plan, which — as he stressed — is a milestone for future cooperation between the two countries.
&gt; 
&gt; “Today Piraeus is the largest port in the Mediterranean and among the ten largest in the world,” the president of the Chinese colossus said in his address to the assembled throng.
&gt; 
&gt; For his part, Mitsotakis noted that Cosco had taken over a subpar port and made it the largest in the Mediterranean, creating at least 3,000 new jobs in the process.
&gt; 
&gt; The Greek PM emphasized that this investment had “materialized during a deep financial crisis” and added: “Your company and China believed and invested in my home country when many considered investment prospects to be non-existent.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I attach great importance to new infrastructure, new hotels and the development of Piraeus that will make it a world-class hub for cruising,” Mitsotakis added. He also welcomed the Chinese interest in shipbuilding, noting that it is important to support domestic business activity in Perama.
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier on Monday, speaking at a Greek-Chinese business forum in Shanghai before more than sixty Greek businessmen and dozens of their Chinese counterparts, the Greek PM invited businessmen to place their trust in Greece, stressing that “now is the right time.”
&gt; 
&gt; “We are a government fully committed to implementing the necessary changes that will ‘unlock’ the real potential of this country, while you have all those features that can make Greece a real success story,” he added.
&gt; 
&gt; PM Mitsotakis also referred to the negative borrowing rates Greece enjoyed just a few days ago, which — as he correctly pointed out — was unthinkable until recently.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/drp7ip/greek_pm_vows_to_make_piraeus_largest_port_in/f6k64u1/,ThallassaGreece,1572905786

Yeah, that's why there are foreing soldiers on its territory, right? I would like to see how long will your ""independence"" last once you stop sucking USA's dick.

5489,"&gt; It makes no sense to surrender all control of your own currency just so Germany can artificially price dump their exports even harder.

That's not what happened, and if it did happen, if wouldn't have anything todo with the Euro. 

A lot of the usual whinging about the Euro and the self-righteous complaints about alleged ""German dominance"" only works because it conveniently omits the fact that Germany didn't really profit from the Euro until *after* the crisis of 2007/2008. Until then, Germany was known as the ""sick man of Europe"" while the real party happened all across the South, where failed fiscal policies and the ability to take on debt at German rates (i.e. 2-5% instead of 8-9%) created a deficit-driven boom (especially in real estate) that drove up wages for over a decade. 

When the crisis finally hit, the southern economies were too expensive vis-à-vis Germany and had no chance. Whilst the South was squandering its cheap money on consumption instead of getting up productivity, Germany did the opposite: It beat down its wages and went through a period of gruelling austerity and deflation in order to get a competitive advantage. 

That's the reason why Germany outcompeted everyone ever since. It has nothing to do with the Euro. It has everything to do with utterly misguided fiscal and economic policies in the South.

But let's assume we all ditch the Euro. Germany would instantly lose out to all the other economies who can devalue their currency, right?

Wrong. Germany has a central bank as well, you know? It's the biggest and richest one in all of Europe and can easily outgun both the Bank of France and the Bank of England combined if it so chooses. Put a dedicated interventionist at its helm and it can beat down the value of the Deutschmark quicker than you could say ""*wait, wha'?*""

Because their interests no longer aligned. Not because of anything else, which is exactly what I'm saying.

It does. I don't see a peace prize for Xi Jinping, even though he's stopping terrorism.

It resembles the first guard house erected during 1961, behind a sandbag barrier toward the border. Over the years this had been replaced several times by guard houses of different sizes and layouts (see photographs). The one removed during 1990 was considerably larger than the first one and did not have sandbags. Tourists used to be able to have their photographs taken for a fee with actors dressed as allied military policemen standing in front of the guard house but Berlin authorities banned the practice in November 2019 stating the actors had been exploiting tourists by demanding money for photos at the attraction.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/drmans/berlin_bans_performers_posing_as_us_soldiers_at/f6jonl9/,duisThias,1572897892

She really loved Germany, she tried to instill a lot of pride in us for our cultural heritage.  She had newspapers from Germany from the early 1900's and late 1800's she collected.  

I'm half Swedish and half German, and while we still have Christmas traditions on the Swedish side like lutefisk, there was definitely a lot more pride on the German side.

You are that guy though. Europe (and the Mediterranean basin) is one of the most intensely damaged ecologies on this planet with practically no wild regions remaining, the vast majority of Europe is now cultural landscape.\* Colonists in North America were awed by the abundance of the rivers, seas, forests, plains etc. Europe is the second most densely populated continent (after Asia), it's undoubtedly overpopulated with respect to the resources its inhabitants collectively consume and could not sustain this level of consumption if it was not in the business of exporting high value-added services and specialized goods, which help enable other regions of the world to better exploit nature now and in the future. Europe was the first to achieve the steep population curve we associate with modern times, though (I guess due having to develop many of the comforts of our times) it was less steep and spread out over a longer period since (I guess) stuff like medical care increasing life expectancy is easier to import than invent from scratch.

Africa would need to double its population to reach European levels of density (and has comparable natural resources to Europe), the Americas would need to triple. India is the outlier in Asia and its removal as an exception puts the rest of Asia on par with Europe.

5620,"The nations left because their elite sensed the moment was right to grab the power in a chunk of the empire. Nothing more, nothing less. In no country that succeeded Austria-Hungary was there a plebiscite on leaving the Monarchy. 

And the fact is that until 1918 there was no secessionist movement in any part of the empire, even in Bosnia-Herzegovina. All the debate was about reforming, not splitting up the empire. There was no noteworthy anti-war movement until 1917. 

After the war, much has been made out of Czechoslovak legions in Russia, but out of 1.4 million Czech soldiers who fought in WW1, only 90 000 chose to switch sides and fight against Austria, out of a pool of almost half a million Czech POWs. The South Slavic nations showed even less enthusiasm. Their legion numbered only about 20 000 soldiers, and the vast majority of them were Serbs.

The history of civil strife in all of the countries which succeeded Austria-Hungary demonstrates that the population was completely unready for independence and that there was nothing like a popular consensus on what should the new states look like. The only reasonable explanation is that independence was done not according to, but not taking into account the popular opinion.

5656,"&gt; On refugees, to them it is life or death, but to the EU and its member states, they are a burden. Sure you could make the argument that they help solve the inverted demography but a) that is only in the short term, b) they increase Carbon emissions and c) most of them are so culturally different to the already divided Europeans that they’d only cause more problems for a theoretical EU superpower.

Let's set aside for a second that most refugees are climate refugees (that is to say, the reason they are refugees is most likely in part due to climate change related issues. The carbon emissions of the US and Europe have contributed to the climate catastrophe which ended up booting them out. Even if you don't care about being a good person when someone's in need, there's a culpability here. And before you ask, yes, this means that the likes of China should be taking in refugees as well to deal with the crisis they helped cause).

Here's a question for you: If I get on a plane that has 99 passengers on it, and fly from London to Berlin, did I increase the carbon emission of that plane? Probably only very slightly. So will refugees, who mostly take mass transit and don't have access to cars as much, have that large an impact on carbon emissions? No.

If you wanted to offset the carbon cost of twelve refugees moving to your city, you could probably do that just by switching from driving to taking public transport. And if that public transport is carbon-neutral, all the better.

This all assumes, basically, that the carbon cost of a refugee is the same as that of someone already established in that country. Like if twelve refugees moved to the UK, and I took the GDP per capita to calculate how much value they had just brought to the country, I'd have made a very obvious error.

Thirdly, on them being so culturally different. Bullshit. I work part-time at a cafe. I work with people from all different cultures and places. People of different backgrounds, of different experiences, etc. I've never had any trouble working with them. What I've noticed, not so much from me, but from them, is that we all share so much in common. We all need to eat, we all need a home, we all need access medical care, and to a lesser extent, we all need a job or something to do, and we all need to feel safe. When those are present, I don't reckon there's much people have to complain about interpersonally. I have a brother, and what I notice is we always used to get in fights when we weren't doing anything- the devil makes wicked work for idle hands, as the saying goes. The same is clear all across history- during the Great Depression, people were scrambling to get a job, usually for security, but also because sitting at home and doing nothing all day is depressing as fuck- the Great Depression is aptly named. I've had a week off school before where I just sat and did pretty much nothing of value for days at a time. That messed me up badly. My friends and I would talk about how we were excited to go back to school because we missed each other, but also because we missed having things to do.

That's all a personal way of saying I don't think you're right. When you look at a group as a whole, you can easily say ""ah, but this is the tradition they come from,"" say in the form of LGBTQ+ rights in the likes of Algeria. Sure, but being a homophobe isn't a tradition, it's a bigotry. There's people in Northern Ireland that think those things, there's probably people on my street that think those things. The only difference is it's Government policy in Algeria. And I'm confident when people are presented with people unlike them in sexuality or gender identity, like with race or nationality, and they realise that everybody shares needs and that everything else is secondary, we'll start to see people abandon those ideas more. It's not a sure-fire fix, but it helps.


For your first point, maybe it is a short term solution, but you're talking all this about the EU not having the time to change- maybe a short-term solution can help us generate a long-term one. You can argue about whether it can, but trying is better than not trying.

As for all the left and right stuff, I'm surprised you'd so openly admit the right does not like refugees. Usually, people on the right at least pretend to think refugees are okay. But you went and said the quiet bit out loud- letting refugees in is not what the right do. They're much more the ""let them drown"" types.

But for the EU taking a side: no, it didn't. Germany decided to take in refugees, Italy didn't. There's no one EU system for dealing with refugees. Each member state has their sovereignty on the matter.

AS for the EU itself being partisan: no shit, really? The transnational organisation meant to prevent war in Europe and act as a forum for co-operation is *partisan?* I mean, it's certainly not anarchist, and it's certainly not fascist, and it's certainly not 100 other things, so what I think you mean by partisan is ""not close enough to my politics for me not to notice it's partisan.""

5804,"&gt;As I said, Tank comparision is already hard due difference in doctrines and use. 

I agree there, I've reacted a bit aggressively due to the massive amount of posts in the nature: ""It's a shit tank from the 1970s"", well so is pretty much every other major tank, but they've all received upgrades.

&gt;I didn't say the T-72B3 is crap. I'm just not thinking is completly on an equal Level like the Leopard 2A7

It's not on the equal level, but it doesn't have to be, the doctrine is different, as you've said. The fact remains that EU in pure armor numbers (not only tanks) is extremely overshadowed by Russia. NATO armies have switched focus on combating Islamic insurgencies and are severely lacking when it comes to combating a modern industrialized army.

There's also the shitty armor doctrine in modern NATO which tries to make tanks indestructible stopping at no cost, because dead soldiers are bad for publicity. This gave us the Challenger II, a tank which weighs over 75 tons, is extremely slow, still uses a rifled barrel because of HESH (ATGMs are a passing fad after all /s), and is touted as being indestructible, commonly followed with the story of 70 RPG-7 hits, ignoring that those were PG-7VL rockets, that a single RPG-29 has penetrated it when it was actually used, and that PG-7VR rockets will also most likely penetrate it. And that's ignoring that the primary anti-tank weapon of an industrialized army like Russia will be ATGMs and not RPGs.

Armor isn't the only problem, EU armies also have a tremendous lack of artillery, both rocket and tube.

In general I'm frustrated by the unwillingness of EU and NATO at large to admit it has a problem with it's militaries, because that would mean they'd have to do something and that means spending money.
