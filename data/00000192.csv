11,"Because public opinion of the US in Germany is nothing more than a reflection of current German opinion of the current American presidency. Are you really that surprised that a American president that repeatedly undermined European unity and Germany on the world stage is making America unpopular in Germany? And the same could be said about American public opinions of other countries. During the invasion of Iraq, American public opinion of France was in the dumpsters. That didn't mean that France needed to instantly cancel all cooperation with the US due to it. Anybody with half a brain cell understands that this poll doesn't mean that Germans thing the US will invade them, just like American public opinion polls doesn't mean that Americans think Iran will nuke them. It just shows that Germans think that Trump's America First policy along with its protectionist tendencies are a threat to the global order Germany benefits so much from.

And why should American allies always have a high opinion of the United States? If America damages relations with its parteners, like it has over the past 2 years, of course the respective populations will start to view it as a threat. Rather than threatening and bullying others with threat like the ones you are making, America should focus on improving its standing with its allies and repair its relationships if it ever wants to retain its status as the leader of the Free World.

World Bank is obligated to accept all numbers as they are. As a general rule, so does the Maddison Project scholars but they do make some adjustements, especially for countries where data collection has been historically poor (EE countries in the last 40 years and previously mentioned China).

When economic historians use data, they often use either the Maddison database or use the Penn World Tables (which are put out by a similar team).

For years, Oxfam and other aid charities have accused governments of being ""unaccountable"" in negotiations on trade policy, a prime target of their lobbying a decade or so ago. Yet they have rejected all attempts to make them accountable themselves. They have also regularly fabricated damaging scare stories in a cynical effort to drum up more members and more cash. Now, their day of reckoning has come, tragically only after they have abused so many people they were supposed to be helping. Not only must a thorough and searching independent audit of their activities be conducted. Permanent arrangements will then needed to ensure that they are subjected to the same rigorous standards of transparency, governance and oversight that they so piously demand of others. Oxfam's shameful misconduct has abused the trust placed in it by both its financial supporters and by recipients of aid. Unless it can convince the world that it has cleaned up its mess, it should be closed down.


The response by Oxfam mirrors that of the Catholic Church as it faced the abuse revelations that first emanated from Baltimore. The fallback position was that because the organization's goals are beyond reproach, its name must be defended from scrutiny. Like the Catholic Church, people quietly moved off into new roles in precisely the same environments—for years. Like shamed churchmen, they now appear ambivalent if not tone-deaf regarding criticism (perhaps mindful of left-wing sensibilities, the country director responsible has taken particular umbrage at the suggestion the villa used was ""chic""). Given the organization's stated goal of empowering women, it has presumably been rooting out identical behavior from local elites for decades. And yet it has held itself to a lower standard.


&gt;Talking to friends who work in the sector, I have found that the only thing that seemed to surprise anybody was that these kinds of lurid tales had not surfaced any sooner. ""Everybody right now is holding their breath,"" says one veteran humanitarian who has worked in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. ""This is endemic for the whole industry; it's not just Oxfam.

85,"Yeah I did google it and there's no evidence of industrial espionage. I saw the BND thing and the Snowden thing. The BND thing was not industrial espionage and Snowden released no evidence of industrial espionage.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what Snowden said 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In text released ahead of a lengthy interview to be broadcast on  Sunday, ARD TV quoted Snowden saying the NSA does not limit its  espionage to issues of national security and he cited German engineering  firm, Siemens as one target.   
&gt;  
&gt;“If there’s information at Siemens  that’s beneficial to U.S. national interests - even if it doesn’t have  anything to do with national security - then they’ll take that  information nevertheless,” Snowden said, according to ARD, which  recorded the interview in Russia where he has claimed asylum  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Snowden also told the German public broadcasting network he no longer  has possession of any documents or information on NSA activities and has  turned everything he had over to select journalists.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;He said he did not have any control over the publication of the information, ARD said.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-security-snowden-germany-idUSBREA0P0DE20140126](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-security-snowden-germany-idUSBREA0P0DE20140126)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So where are these documents? Why haven't they been published? I do not believe that a journalist would just sit on such an explosive story. Snowden himself chose which journalists he gave the documents to. He could literally just email these documents out himself if he wanted to. Why is he sitting on them?

&amp;#x200B;

Snowden has no credibility. First, he's an IT professional, he has no idea what the documents are about nor analyze them. Assuming he's telling the truth about possesing and handing over these documents, then the fact that the documents on alleged industrial espionage haven't been published mean that whatever journalist he gave them to doesn't think they represent industrial espionage and aren't worth publishing.  Second, he's on the run ***in Russia***.

not ""it theoretically could"" more of ""in all likelihood due to x injury/defect it would""

&gt;As for your other comments, I note that the shechita apparently doesn't forbid using the same knife without washing 

i am not an expert just a regular jew who has done a little research, but it is possible it does require the knife be washed between slaughters

&gt;so spreading BSE should be kosher.

its still a health concern

&gt;One obvious question is how painful is the kosher method when the butcher makes a mistake?

idk but you are also negelecting to mention that mistakes in shechita are far more consequential as nonkosher meat is far less valuable than kosher meat so if he messes up he just wasted a lot of money - compare this to stunning methods which routinely go very badly and have relatively little consequence for screwing it up

350,"&gt; Nah. Still Muslim. Much the same. 


Nope, there are much differing attitudes toward social issues and devout practice between settled/Westernized Muslims and new arrivals from Muslim-Majority countries.


&gt; If anything, 2nd and 3rd gen. Muslims are worse in behavior from what we've seen.


Nope, no source.


&gt; Still the same group culturally in comparison to real Europeans.


Not at all. [There is a _sharp_ divide towards social and cultural attitudes between groups of Muslims depending on where they live and the social attitudes towards the country at large.](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/)* More westernized and less devout Muslims are far more similar to Europeans on social attitudes.

*It should be noted that this study only surveyed European Muslims from a handful of European countries. But it does illustrate a strong trend towards similarity with Europeans on social attitudes vs. Muslim majority countries. 

Also, I wasn’t aware Balkan Muslims who’ve lived in Europe for centuries weren’t “real Europeans” now. 

Or do you just mean brown people?


&gt; So?


Lol, that’s your response? Okay lemme break it down. 

If Europeans weren’t nearly as skeptical towards Muslims until VERY recently, that means their opposition and skepticism isn’t directed as Muslims as a group or Islam in and of itself, but to the surrounding economic and social issues that revolve around a large group of poor people from a more socially-conservative culture relocating in a short period of time.

They don’t view Muslims as a whole as a negative group, but large, rapid movements of new poor people with differing social attitudes.


&gt; Yeah, Europeans should let in people they're completely indifferent to into their country forever. Lol, great morals you got.


Dude, they’re indifferent (or supportive) to the concept of increasing diversity, not the actual people they meet in their day-to-day lives.

Jesus, why do you think in abstract ethnic collectives so much?


&gt; Source? :)


Basic morality. Judge people by content of their character, not the color of their skin, religion, etc.


&gt; Nowhere does it specify that.


It actually does! 

You know where? 

_Your own damn source._

Read the analysis past the points you’re trying to cherrypick. That’s where I got that point from to begin with.


&gt; It's attitude towards immigrants, not attitude towards immigrants based on their economic impact.


Jesus Christ, _what?_

It’s attitudes towards immigrants and correlating them to economic indicators to provide useful information on the origin of those attitudes and why they are different!


&gt; You speak of no ethics whatsoever, only lame words.


Do you not understand the basic ethics behind the moral wrong that is bigotry?


&gt; Ok, understandable.


Cool.


&gt; My argument has nothing to do with diversity, but with Muslims.


“diversity (disgusting)” suuuure buddy. 

But either way, I hope it’s clear that the distinction is largely irrelevant.


&gt; Or against. :)


If it was put to a vote, indifferent would side with supportive, which is why anti-immigration parties are in the opposition in Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland(actually they don’t even have an anti-immigration party), and most of Western Europe, save for Italy and Greece.


&gt; Yeah, that's why over the decades America has been becoming increasingly a better place to live for its citize- Oh.


Finally! This is where I get to slam dunk on your complete ignorance of American culture and quality of life.

Immigration (both legal and illegal) over the last 25 years has coincided with a 23% fall in the murder rate and a general fall in violent and property crimes.

We treat all our people like Americans, United in the dream of a better, freer life for all of us. Our moments of unity are a truly beautiful thing that cuts across all racial, religious or ethnic divides.

Just spend a week going around New York City, which just recorded its lowest murder rate since 1950, to see what I mean.

Our differences are like the spices on the underlying food that is our shared humanity. Hence our nation’s motto: E Pluribus Unum

Out of Many, One. 

That’s why despite our many, _many_ problems, I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else.

The fact that the system had become almost completely dysfunctional in its later years certainly helped support the people's wish for some strong individual to take over and sort things out.

401,"&gt; If they took out Soviets they would have all the time they need, so that wouldnt be a problem.

Taking out the Soviets was impossible from a military perspective. Their best hope was to support a rival of Stalin and take advantage of a divided society, but Stalin had already done his purges.

&gt; In late 1943, until then they were fine. Germans were close to winning in 1942, so that doesnt really matter.

They had already lost against the RAF (British air superiority) and at El Alamein (losing any hope of gaining Africa) before the end of 1942. Not to mention the sea was already practically secure for Allied convoys by then.

&gt; Manpower wasnt really an issue, they had whole Europe under their control after all.

Exactly the reason behind the manpower issue. Garrisoning and controlling all that land against hostile populations sucks up a lot of manpower.

&gt; Germans had over 6 million troops, while only about 3.5 million were in Russia

So over half of their manpower bogged down in huge swath of land and greatly outnumbered, with the Soviet factories safe behind the Urals...

&gt; Same cant be said about the Soviets. If they lost in Stalingrad, it would be over for them.

They would have just retreated more deep into their territory...

It's a centre of many diverse cultures (I mean nowadays they're mostly Italians and all). Also too much of Milan's architecture is pretty recent, the castle has been stripped with time, things like napoleon and Austria helped in that; San siro is terribly ugly.

By beauty I meant aesthetics and I usually don't care if the nightlife is the bomb when traveling, I mostly repetitively go to museums and old buildings.

The 30000 members voted a lot of the people in this list into positions of power, to be their representatives. As such then removing these people after they made comments damaging for the party still opens the question why they got voted there in the first place. Are we to believe that people who would make such statements to the press would not say things at least as bad in private party circles?

Also, I am interested if people pointing out that members like Poggenburg (still party member and in the fraction by the way) were forced to retire from their positions actually disagree with their views.

At the same time, the Iranian government also blamed the attack on the Iraqi secret police, and a regional government actually executed four captured men it alleged to be 'Iraqi agents' for the attack (some have suggested it was a bit of a show trial). Another separate Iranian tribunal executed a man named Mehdi Tafari for the same incident, although in 1985 the head of military intelligence informed the press that this had been the work of royalist army officers.

In fact, [Soviets outnumbered the German in the eastern front even before the Battle of Stalingrad by half.](http://2k8r3p1401as2e1q7k14dguu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Comparative-Strengths1.jpg) 

[considering the overall size of the wehrmacht,](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uRcSTJOUxmM/TjqPb5nVu5I/AAAAAAAAAA4/vZSR0I83YjQ/s1600/ger1.jpg) they didnt. Germans just got overconfident, they still had plenty of reserves which were available to them.

&gt; So three months after the battle started and given a bunch of green soldiers. Truly those 12 000 would have made a massive difference in a battle where both sides had over a million men in the battle. 

There were dozens of available divisions chilling in France (not just there), these were just an example. Since Germans were winning pretty easily on Eastern Front (until they got destroyed at Stalingrad), they got overconfident and didnt call for additional reinforcements. 

&gt; Good plan but not realistic. 

They were just too eager to finish Stalingrad asap. They should be more patient.

&gt; Like they weren't able to defend the plains outside Moscow? 

There are many factors which helped them defend Moscow (winter, fresh troops from the east, huge mobilizations), almost none of them would be availaible after Stalingrad. Also Stalingrad under German control means troops in the Caucasus are screwed.

Not to mention that Germans would have access to oil, while Soviets would have to rely on allied supplies.

&gt; Moscow may have been an important city but taking it wouldn't have starved the entire northern front. 

It doesnt really have to starve entire front.. half of it or even third of it is enough for Germans to expliot their superiority in numbers and destroy the remaining forces. 

&gt; [Is that why they gained around two million extra soldiers during 1942](http://2k8r3p1401as2e1q7k14dguu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Comparative-Strengths1.jpg) 

Yea and after that their numbers went downhill even after they liberated whole of Russia.  That just proves that they didnt really had any more reserves in 1942.

Considering Germans had most of the Europe under their control, while most of Russia was occupied, the Russian comeback was pretty epic.  People think it was given that Russians won because of their numbers, but thats just bullshit, since Germans had much bigger manpower pool to take from, they just didnt mobilize soon enough.

Germans were underestimating the Russians from 1939 till 1943. When they finally realized what they are standing against, it was too late to change the outcome. ",,/r/europe/comments/adixme/gdp_per_capita_in_europe_before_ww2/edkg9j0/,ElectricianSVK,1546964298

Actually, what differentiates us from less developed parts of the world:     
1. Extremely privileged economic situation based on hundreds of years of exploitation of most of those less developed countries, putting in the continued position of a dominant exploiter.     
2. The eradication of dissent through propaganda and pro-religious, pro-capitalist, anti-atheist, anti-socialist/communist, pro-democratic education.    
3. A firm control of public opinion through the media and censorship.    
4. The suppression of parties such as the Nazis or Communists.

But in case you don't realize, in all Abrahamic religions god brought his message to earth. Be it in the form of a burning bush, or whatever way god spoke to Moses for the commandments.


Or in case of Islam were god directly inspired the prophet Mohammed to write down gods word in the form of the Quran.
Of course in Islam Jesus is also accepted as a prophet but not as the (son of) god. But still someone who brought the message of god. 


But if we are completely fair your ""Christians out of Europe! Out out out!"" Is completely unfair
as I did not say anything about anyone out, so don't put words in my mouth. 

If you look at the comment chain, the full context is **roughly** about Religions law vs ruling law, in that context my comment about people who can choose not to live in a country like Belgium were the ruling law goes against what god said is perfectly fair. 
And yes this includes Christians who might be unhappy with the way things go in Belgium.

We are not even that far removed from when the Catholic church had a disproportional say in the way our society functioned. Parish over village, a priest with too much power and say in the daily affairs and the most important figure of the community. 

Now after hundreds of years of living under strict religious rule, the churches are empty, people finally don't care anymore. We are free of the chains of religion enslaving us. This is a fairly recent development and a huge one.
Freedom of religion is important, but 'Freedom from religion' is way more important in my opinion.

Turns out they were heating the coffee to an extreme degree to cut off on conservation costs, and serving it while it still was too hot to be safe for human handling. There had been several complaints to the company from customers and staff about how insanely dangerous this could be, and yet they chose to ignore it because until someone sued it was just more profitable for them to not do anything.

To top it off, the lady was sitting on a car that was not even moving, and the coffee she was served had a broken lid. So you can't even blame her from recklessly drinking coffee in a moving car. The damages that lady received were so extreme that her genitalia basically melted off into her leg and the doctors were not sure she would survive. I've watched images, and they were nightmare fuel.

She was just a nice old lady who was served a coffee that was knowingly too hot to be safe for human consumption in a broken cup, sued only for the medical cost of the extreme damage she suffered, and yet got demonized by the media as some sort of money hungry sue-happy monster that preyed upon a poor multi-billion company.

I don't think that ""you have to serve coffee in a temperature range that doesn't make peoples genitalia melt off if they accidentally pour it on themselves"" is a insanely high standards for companies.

1054,"**An investigation is underway after Frank Magnitz, head of the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Bremen, was seriously injured in what's thought to be a ""politically motivated"" gang attack, police said Tuesday.**

Magnitz, who is chairman of the the anti-immigration AfD in Bremen, in the north of the country, and a member of parliament in Germany, was assaulted in the city centre on Monday afternoon. [Police said](https://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/35235/4159891) the attack took place in front of the Theater am Goetheplatz at around 5.20pm.

""Given the victim's work, we believe that this is a politically motivated act,"" police said.

[The AfD party in Bremen](https://www.afd-bremen.de/2019/01/attentat-auf-frank-magnitz-mdb-pressemitteilung-vom-07-01-2019/) published a shocking photo that showed the injuries. In the picture, Magnitz is unconscious on a hospital bed, his face bleeding and swollen with a gash on his forehead.

The statement by AfD Bremen said three people with their faces covered had carried out the attack. Magnitz had attended a New Year's reception hosted by local newspaper the Weser-Kurier before the assault, party officials said.

""They hit him with a piece of wood until he was unconscious and then kicked him on the ground,"" a statement from the party said, adding that a construction worker had intervened to stop the assault.

The party said it would be watching closely how politicians react to this attack. ""Today is a black day for democracy in Germany,"" the statement added.

""The state executive committee and the members of the AfD state association are shocked,"" continued the statement. ""We wish Frank Magnitz a good and quick recovery.""  


AfD politician Jörg Meuthen said on Twitter that Magnitz was ""beaten half to death"". He added that he was ""devastated"" and described it as a ""cowardly and repugnant attack"".

The attack was condemned by politicians and commentators, including Cem Özdemir of the Green party. He said on Twitter that he hoped the perpetrators would be caught.

""There is no justification whatsoever for violence,"" even against the AfD, he added. ""Those who fight with hate only allow hate to win in the end.""

Johannes Kahrs, an MP from the Social Democrats, junior partners in the ruling coalition, said ""violence is never acceptable"" and that ""extremism in any form is rubbish"". He wished Magnitz a quick recovery.

1069,"&gt;Byzantines were Greeks. Not Romans

Still going on about this nonsense? You need to stop using Roman like it is an ethnic term because it was never specifically an ethnic term. Roman was a civic identity, being Greek does not mean you can't also be Roman.

Now sure, Greeks were initially not Romans, because they were not citizens, but by the 3rd Century every free person within the Empire became a citizen under the Emperor Caracalla, including the Greeks.

Your statement is just completely meaningless, saying ""they were Greeks, not Roman"", does infact not mean anything. Being Greek is not mutually exclusive to being Roman or vice versa.

&gt;They didn't speak Latin

Neither did the Egyptian Romans, or the Syriac Romans, or the Berber Romans, or the Thracian Romans, or the Etruscan Romans. They're still Romans. 

&gt; they were culturally different

Care to elaborate? Also, even if you can demonstrate how, that doesn't really prove anything, yet again. Because culture is something that changes, just because a culture changes does not mean it is no longer that same culture. American culture today is extremely different from American culture in say, 1840, but it is still American culture. 

The idea that culture is some static, unchangable thing is the most out of touch idea I've ever read.

&gt;they had different religions

The Roman Empire had Christianity as the state religion since Theodosius in the late 4th Century, and Emperors had been Christian (with the exception of Julian) since Constantine. Were Theodosius and Constantine not Romans?

&gt;most importantly, they didn't control Rome.

They did, for 300 years. So by your own logic, the Roman Empire ended under the reign of Constantine V. Also using a city state logic to define Rome is pretty ignorant, considering it had pretty much stopped operating by the city state mentality since at the latest, the Social War in the 2nd Century B.C.

&gt;This is like saying the Chinese are direct descendants of Qing Manchus. In reality Manchus conquered the Chinese.

Interesting, because last time I checked the Chinese had a violent revolution to get rid of Manchu rule, one in which they won.

Do tell me of the successful Greek revolution to overthrow the Roman Empire again? Also last time I checked, Chinese people do not identify as Manchu.

&gt;you have no idea what ""Rome"" means.

There are people killing in the name of Jesus but it’s never widely accepted by their religious peers like it is in Islam. Also no matter how many Wikipedia pages you find, there are more acts of terrorism in the name of Islam than there is in the name of every other religion combined and you can even times that by 50.

I’m not sure if you’re right about the stoning since I’m not gonna fact check it, but it doesn’t matter if the Bible says it, who actually does it?

I don’t know why you would give a pass to a dangerous ideology like Islam. Any logical person would see that pattern and see a problem, maybe you’re one of those people like Ben Affleck who thinks criticizing Islam is ‘racist’ or you’re an atheist who is so against Christianity that you paint a picture of it being evil; either way you’re ignorant to what is going on in the world. If you can’t admit that Islam presents an ideology that people use to cause violence on a mass scale, then I don’t know what to say.

lol

&gt; no matter your opinion of Trump

Yeah right, Trump is only a symptom, not the cause and hardly much worse than previous presidents, in fact as he hasn't started a major war yet, he's probably better than W. Bush. Trump is only a war monger half the time, the other half he is doing things like actively scaling back US involvement in Syria and Afghanistan (probably in spite of Republican leadership). If Trump is your prime issue with the US, you're a simpleton, oblivious to their history and the current state of the Republican party. One has to say it again and again: Trump was hardly the worst republican candidate in 2016, in fact he was very likely in the better half for my money (still terrible but not Cruz, Fiorina or Carson). The only moderately tollerable candidate they had was Rand Paul and that would still have gone down poorly. And it doesn't help that the democrats are republicans-light.

This isn't about terrorist groups. Just look at statistics about the followers of the religion overall.

1.1 Billion Muslims want Sharia law. Since portrayals of Mohammed are effectively outlawed, it stands to reason that a sizeable minority of them, if not more, don't mind the events of four years ago.

Depending on the country, up 40% of Muslims think terrorist attacks on civilians ""in defense of Islam"" can be justified, even in some European countries it's 3-11%! Do you think they were mourning four years ago?

&gt;This could have shown any other drug ex cancer meds, doesn't necessarily mean 1st world people get more cancer, rather that **treatment is more accessible**

as well as a sign of better overall mental healthcare, lower stigma around depression and other mental health problems and antidepressants.

also antidepressants are not just for depression, they are for a variety of mental problems, some are even prescribed to ex. help a person quit smoking (bupropion, escitalopram)

In a perfect world nobody would ever need to take medications, but this is not the world we live in or ever will live in,

mental health has been underresearched since the beginning of time and in many countries the concept of antidepressants is still quite foreign, 


look at Korea, 2nd LOWEST consumer of antidepressants among western countries but nr1 at highest suicide rate.


https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYH8g19WcAAF9Cj.png 

really wouldn't hurt in their cases to increase antidepressant consumption. 

 

Also antidepressants won't get you any form of fast high and cannot be abused like ex. opioids, ADHD meds.

Irony of someone that is complaining about genocide denial is actually denying one of the most cruel and well known genocide in the world.

Narrator: Yes they were.

You know what is really funny is that Australian's defence against the genocide is almost identical to Turkish one lol:

&gt;At most, historians talk about dispossession and displacement, perhaps destruction. The term ""genocide"" is inappropriate for Australian history, many think, because the British and Australian treatment of Aboriginal people does not resemble the Holocaust of European Jewry, and because it flattens out varied and complex patterns of interaction.

Just like how Turkish government tries to say, ""yes they were killed but it was a complex situation and it was more like a displacement rather than genocide. So it wasn't a systematic holocaust style killing.""

Seems familiar?

This empowerment is generally a good thing, as it generally empowers 'good' speech (e.g. the vast majority of communication by professionals), but it also empowers negative speech (e.g. people advertising racist views) and gives the ability for once fringe ideas to latch onto people's emotions and gain a following (see incels).

You can see that this is recent empowerment is most people's concern because the vase majority of talk of silencing is about modern media (social media); people rarely, if ever, talk about shutting down newspapers, books, radio, even film (although occasionally speeches).

If not then would you say the same things about religions like Christianity if they did the same things?

Maybe at the fundamental level all religions are the same. Well on a fundamental level an apple and a banana are the same, so let’s forget about fundamentals. Talk about the teachings and ideologies of these groups. When people are creating credible (in their eyes) reasons for genital mutilation, stoning or killing non believers that are all backed and validated by their religion then we have a big problem. You can’t overlook that by just saying that other religions could be used the same way.

There’s a difference between people abusing a religion and people being encouraged by a religion. When priests abuse Catholicism to take advantage over little boys the entire religion gets called out even though this is just parts of the institution not the actual religion that is acting evil. People in Islam are just acting the way they are supposed to act and no matter what they do this religion never gets criticized in the main stream.

So without talking about the fundamentals (even though Islam isn’t even fundamentally like other religions) is this a dangerous religion that promotes a dangerous ideology?

1525,"&gt; First a thank you for trying to give a constructive answer instead of simply joining the downvoters on my first comment.

yeah no problem

&gt; You might believe that there is no god, but that doesn't make it an objective falsehood

&gt; It's not true and not false, it's uncertain

a sentient being that can influence the life of a person in any way is simply not possible, objectively. there's no uncertainty about that. there can objectively not be a being that could do that. this is simply not an opinion, and i think that it's concerning that they're even presented as equally valid.

&gt; Non religious communities are not special and should not be given special treatment.

nonreligious people don't form communities (that is what not religious means) and they are already not given special treatment

&gt; atheistic dogmas

again, religions use dogmas. you continuously try to present not being religious as if it was just another religion but with a different set of dogmas, but that simply isn't the case.

&gt; these are a minority who try to use their religion to harm other people

not very hard when the religion explicitly tells them to

&gt; Why not just live and let other people live their style of life if it doesn't hurt anyone

i'm not against this. i'm against them forcing their views upon everyone else, and in the case of certain really harmful beliefs, from spreading them at all

&gt; then religious freedom by your definition would be harmful and shouldn't be a thing

then we're in agreement

&gt; It seems like we have different definitions of religious freedom

yeah, we do. my problem is that your definition of ""religious freedom"" is completely redundant with other basic rights, so it's just unnecessary recognition for religions and in the end religious communities end up abusing it like the 3rd grader in my example

&gt; you will see a huge majority that doesn't take everything their religious leaders say word by word and can reflect it critically

During the War in Afghanistan, over 31,000 civilian deaths due to war-related violence have been documented

In July 2002, following a US bombing raid in which Afghan officials say 44 people were killed, including many celebrating a wedding and many children, the Afghan president protested to the U.S. military authorities, and urged them to be more careful in their targeting to prevent any more civilian deaths. 

In May 2007, after heavy aerial bombing by the US military had recently killed 40 to 60 Afghan civilians, including women and children, wounded about 50 more, and destroyed some 100 houses

In June 2007, after the deaths of more than 90 civilians in 10 days, President Hamid Karzai accused ISAF and the US-led military coalition in his country of ""extreme"" and ""disproportionate"" use of force. 

On August 23, 2008, about 250 Afghan villagers gathered in angry demonstration to protest the deaths of 76 civilians, most of them children, killed in U.S.-led airstrikes near the village of Azizabad, about 120 kilometres south of Herat city in western Afghanistan.


In March 2011, Karzai rejected apologies from President Obama and Gen. David Petraeus for U.S. helicopter gunners killing 9 Afghan boys ages 7–13 who were collecting firewood.

Many more were killed as a result of military intervention, e.g. starvation

Nah logic points to more frequent and larger attacks because they would be unchallenged and have the ability to plan and conduct attacks without any hassle since Europe would not be spending huge amounts of resources in order to disrupt islamic terrorism within European borders.

1628,"I don't disagree that certain belief systems are bad and incompatible with modern Western society. I'm pretty wary of Islam in the same way, just this conversation tends to go in the direction of condemning religion in general. Which is obviously dumb imo because like how you outlined the dangerous aspects of Islam, it all depends on the specific religion and the values it espouses.. and then of course, my point was that everyone has a kind of religious basis to their beliefs regarding the world that they don't like having questioned, whether they realize it or not. It's the same psychological mechanics, just different beliefs.

&gt;They also practice taqqiya which is actively lying to those outside of Islam when necessary to advance its interests.

Is that what happened with how they explain the meaning of jihad? lol

&gt;These are not people who can or will assimilate fully into western societies.

This is something I'm not 100% on though. Thing about Muslims is they tend to be pretty honest whenever you ask them hypotheticals. The problem ones are honestly pretty easy to spot ('problem' being ones expressing views that would imply willingness to violate the law under certain circumstance, nothing else).

There really are peaceful Muslims though. I think the key factor is that it has to be abundantly clear that violation of the rule of law won't be tolerated. I hate to bash the EU in this regard because I think the problem with Muslims in the EU is very serious and I'm honestly worried about it, but that's pretty much strictly an EU problem, not a US problem. They have unabated religious freedoms here and there hasn't been any targeted legislation against stuff like full-face veils.

1848,"**15 important works of art that are found abroad and that Italy would like to come back**



Not only the Athlete of Lysippus and the Flowerpot by Jan van Huysum: here is a list of fifteen important works of art that have come out of Italy in various historical periods and for various reasons, and that Italy would like to come back.
There are not only the Lisippo Athlete , that the minister of cultural heritage Alberto Bonisoli would like to return as soon as possible to Italy , or the flower vase of Jan van Huysum, stolen in Florence by the Nazis during the Second World War and that the director of the Uffizi, Eike D. Schmidt , has asked Germany to launch an appeal for the return . There are several works that have left the national borders in various periods, and which Italy would like to include: in some cases, cultural diplomacy has already been working for some time and it is not excluded that the works can return, in other cases deals with much less probable returns (almost from ""book of dreams""), but they are always works that were part of Italian collections and that for various reasons they ended up abroad (theft, war booties, illicit excavations ...). Without wanting to enter into complicated legal questions, nor wishing to establish whether Italy might be right or wrong in the various disputes, we list below fifteen important works that have come out of Italy and for which we discussed about their possible return. As mentioned, in some cases these are remote eventualities, in others of concrete possibilities: the list that we propose has been designed exclusively to give a dimension to the phenomenon.

1. Etruscan art, Chariot of Monteleone 
(second quarter of the 6th century BC; bronze and ivory, 130.9 x 209 cm; New York, Metropolitan Museum) 

The Etruscan Chariot of Monteleone is a precious object identified as a parade cart belonging to a high Etruscan dignitary: it is a very rare artifact, which has a rich decorative apparatus (with panels adorned with mythological subjects), strongly influenced by Greek art. The Chariot was found in Monteleone di Spoleto in 1902 by a local peasant: the author of the find gave it up, after a series of negotiations involving other intermediaries, at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Recent studies have discovered that it was an illicit sale: Italy has already sent the request for restitution to the United States, and it is said that in the future the Chariot of Monteleone can not be exhibited in one of our museums.

1850,"&gt;yeah no. this is how you make yourself look like like a retard in one sentence

Feel free to tell me why. 

&gt;no it should not. the generic freedom to do what you want is perfectly enough. treating religion as if it were special is fucking retarded. it's a choice, nothing more. we should not legitimize religions like that

By reading how you disagree with muslims and jews, I just assume that you are a person who beliefs that there exists no god and the idea of a god shouldn't affect how our society works. Feel free to correct me if my assumption is wrong. Your opinion is covered the same way their opinion is protected and it even protects your right to not participate in their practices.

Then let's assume that freedom of religion (including the right to deny following a religion btw!) wasn't covered by the Constitution, only by a generic freedom to do what you want. What would be better for you or the society in general?

&gt;they're doing enough damage to society as is, why worsen the problem by appeasing them?

What damage are they doing that wouldn't be caused if we had no freedom of religion?

&gt;exactly. so there should be no ""religious freedom"" for him to exempt him from societal norms.

No, he should still have religious freedom in my opinion. But religious freedom mustn't be an excuse to break rules that are more important than your religion's rules. If the school tells him to do his homework and his god tells him to do it not (however he can communicate with him), then the school is more important.

1865,"&gt;So why do we need to help this person who could pay thousands of dollars for the trip?

I'm precisely saying that's an immense investment for dozens of people to offer the migrant opportunities he would never have in his own country to study and work. When thousands of dollars are the savings of a lifetime of dozens of people, not even the poorest, and not a few months of the minimum salary, it's still extreme poverty in comparison. We should help this person because otherwise he'll be dead, tracked or enslaved. 

&gt;because they are fine with looking the other way themselves when it is out of sight.

I'm not, and it's good that you're not neither. 

&gt; If this is your goal, you should be against this kind of migration and advocate for more student visums and investment in education, which I would totally support. The Africans coming here to study are more then welcome.

I'm not in favor of this kind of migration. That's the only kind most have, sadly, so it's here, just in front of us. Student or work visas are pretty much impossible to obtain for citizens of some countries. 

&gt;They make a choice to do that. By placing them in a constant victim role, you are not even seeing these people as individuals anymore with their own choices and abilities.

I'm saying the contrary. They're victims of the circonstances (global wealth distribution) and they're doing with courage what a lot of us would in the same shoes, trying to better our lives the only way we can think of.

&gt; Are they forced to do so? Of course not, Morocco is a stable country and pretty well off compared to others.

And Spain is not as good compared to Switzerland of Norway. That's why a lot of Spanish migrated to other, richer, European countries. Why do you think, if Morroco is that great of a country for the young generations, that a lot of them are trying to get out? Dictature, economic crisis, poverty, repression over minorities... So, as individuals, with their own choices and abilities, they decide to come look for opportunities and produce our vegetables because they're the one desperate enough to work in these conditions.

Most will have an enquirey email address so i would start there, give a summary of your situation and why you want to study at that particular institution (google the things that university is involved in and mention those) and see if theres any advice they can give you on applying there and any regarding possible lines of funding to do so.

Some (hopefully helpful) tips in regards to securing a position on a computer science course:

* Get a GitHub account and put some work on there, GitHub is basically the equivalent of a CV now for CS graduates and is a fantastic way to show off your capabilities.
* You will likely get interviews with CS departments to assess your capability unless you have an internationally recognised high school equivalent qualification. This is to be expected and honestly can be your best opportunity to shine. Prep as best you can for this, research what the institution specializes in when it comes to computer science and try to read up on that.
* A bit of an extension but no one interviewing you or assessing your application will expect you to be a world class scientist when applying for an undergraduate degree. A big mistake people make is to oversell their technical capability when applying for placements/jobs. There really is no need, universities will care a lot more about passion in the subject and willingness to learn than pre-existing knowledge. There are lots of CS prep courses online, you can look at their curriculum and try to emulate it.
* A possible outcome of this is that you get offered a 4 year course, the first year (often called to year 0) is a kind of catchup/prep so when you start the next year you are at the level of people on your course. So you get the normal 3 year course with an extra one first that gets you ready. Obviously that does have the drawback of you having to secure an extra year of funding but overall that would be a good option, it will make sure you have the necessary knowledge for the course and give you some time to settle in before starting on your proper degree.

Tldr: a few possible factors, the most compelling I believe being that Australian GP's have been under significant social/government pressure to ""do something"" for those patient coming forward requesting treatment for depression combined with the fact that the average GP has very little time to engage the patent. I.e. drugs are an ""easy"" fix. 

Anacdotally It seems far more socially acceptable for someone to present themselves as depressed in Australia than it used to - the extreme stigma around mental health seems to be falling. Perhaps that's a contributing factor too.

I was working at an IT company in one of the larger cities in Sweden. It was pretty small at the time, and they decided to bring in a very devout Muslim Pakistani as a tester. Very nice fellow, very intelligent, and a big bushy beard despite him being in his early 20s.

There wasn't many people at the company his age, and most people who were, were upper-management people who did not really seem to want to interact much with the development team. I worked as a developer from home, only visiting the office once a week. The second developer at the company was on sick leave for several months, due to stress from being the only developer at the company before I joined. 

So, the days when I went there, this guy was obviously very happy that there was a co-worker around that he could talk to. I wasn't very social myself, which made it very surprising to see how much he enjoyed me being there. After several weeks, one afternoon, he rolls his chair over to me, as he had done many times before to ask a question or just small-talk. 

He seemed a lot more up-beat than he normally was, not to say he was sad or anything, but he was often very quiet.

He asked what the name was of the city where I was commuting from. I answered, and his face lit up. He said he was actually going there the upcoming weekend. I said ""Cool, what brings you all the way out there?"". He replied that there was a place out there where you could (religiously) slaughter your own lamb. The words he spoke about slaughtering a lamb didn't affect me, but his facial expression when he said it did. He was overjoyed by the thought of slaughtering a lamb in the name of his God.

The best way I could describe his reaction was 'fanatical'. 

He spoke for at least 30 minutes about it, until a higher-up entered the room, and he rolled his chair back.

Unfortunately I left shortly after, and didn't get to talk to him very much after that. 

Not sure where I am going with this story, but it kinda freaked me out a bit that a person who I would consider to be way more timid than any other person I've met here in Sweden, would have these feelings towards the slaughter of an animal, in the name of religion.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/adfm9g/belgium_bans_kosher_and_halal_animal_slaughtering/edh1opq/,Ciubhran,1546871071

2049,"ROTTERDAM, Netherlands — The Hook of Holland, a stretch of land outside Rotterdam sliced by canals, functions in many ways like Britain’s backyard. Greenhouses stretch for miles, nurturing tulips, tomatoes and other supermarket specialties. The bounty is gathered into warehouses and sorted under signs denoting destinations such as Sheffield and Gateshead. Then trucks whisk it all onto ferries headed across the North Sea.

Thanks to this precisely calibrated ecosystem and the European Union’s borderless trading zone, British shops can order fresh produce early in the morning and receive it by the end of the day.

But a no-deal Brexit threatens to throw it all into chaos, resulting in trucks backed up for miles, vegetables spoiled and economic pain for everyone.

The Netherlands — Britain’s main trading partner on mainland Europe — is among the most-prepared for the possibility that Britons will leave the E.U. on March 29 without a deal to manage the withdrawal. Leaders here fear that the best efforts of a nation that loves to be prepared may not be enough to safeguard against the mess. And Britain’s other trading partnerships in Europe could be even worse off.

“Everyone is fully aware that something is going to happen,” said Mark Dijk, the head of external relations at the Port of Rotterdam, whose docks, rail yards and warehouses handle nearly 1 million tons of goods moving to and from Britain every week. The port has been working on Brexit emergency plans for more than a year and is trying to alert businesses that they need to brace for a wave of restrictions.

Britain’s efforts to manage the withdrawal “are so chaotic that it’s hard for people to be sure there won’t be a [no-deal] Brexit,” Dijk said.

No precedent exists for a country scissoring itself out of the interconnected modern world. And yet that outcome appears increasingly likely, as the British Parliament prepares to resume debate on a draft withdrawal agreement that has meager support.

In a no-deal scenario, London’s powerful banks could find themselves in legal limbo when they want to trade in Europe’s market. Millions of British citizens who have lived and worked in the E.U. legally for years, as well as E.U. nationals in Britain, could suddenly become undocumented. Connections between British and European law enforcement agencies would go dark.

British leaders have warned of shortages of food and medicines, and they have asked importers to build stockpiles. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson has put 3,500 troops on standby to deal with potential disruptions. In all, cabinet ministers have approved $2.5 billion of contingency spending.

The countries that will remain in the E.U. also are amping up their no-deal preparations. Irish lawmakers may have to set aside all other business this month to pass 45 pieces of emergency legislation aimed at mitigating the impact of Brexit. France is building roads, warehouses and checkpoints near its ports in preparation for new customs controls.

The E.U.’s headquarters in Brussels unveiled a list of proposals to protect E.U. citizens from the worst consequences of a no-deal Brexit, but that would offer little relief to the British side. British airlines, for example, would be able to carry passengers to E.U. airports only from Britain.

Here in the Netherlands, exports to Britain could fall by 17 percent if Brexit happens without a deal, according to a study from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The Dutch government is scrambling to limit the damage, hiring nearly 1,000 more customs agents for the inspections that would become necessary. The agency, whose officials inspect meat, dairy and animals, is scouring Eastern Europe for veterinarians and giving them crash courses in Dutch because they cannot find enough qualified people at home. And a legion of Dutch farmers and flower growers who take orders from British customers are worried that their supply lines could get tangled in bureaucratic knots.

“It’s all fresh, so you need to be able to deliver on very short notice,” said Pim Leenheer, who works in sales at a Dutch company, DailyFresh Logistics, that organizes food and flower shipments to Britain.

On a gusty afternoon last month, tractor-trailers were arriving as little as 15 minutes before the vast Stena Hollandica ferry — which can hold 3.5 miles of trucks — pulled away. At the other end of the journey, in the British port of Harwich, the ferry can unload in 30 to 45 minutes, said Annika Hult, who directs North Sea shipping for the Stena Line.

The process goes quickly in part because no customs agents are involved. In 1993, countries that belonged to what was then called the European Economic Community pulled down their customs posts and stopped checks between countries.

Little would change if British lawmakers approve the withdrawal deal negotiated by the E.U. and Prime Minister Theresa May. Britain would remain inside the E.U. customs union at least until new trade agreements are devised.

But Britain’s leaving with no deal in place would set trade back decades.

“All of a sudden, you’re going to have certain checks,” Hult said.

Businesses would need to file paperwork with E.U. and British customs agencies when they want to send shipments between countries. Food and animals would need inspections on both sides. Truck drivers already pass through passport checks, since Britain is not a member of Europe’s passport-free travel area, but the post-Brexit checks would be far stricter. Dutch lawmakers are digging into their archives to figure out which old treaties with Britain might still be in force. Some date to the 1940s and 1950, when Europe was rebuilding after World War II.

Some shipping and logistics companies expect that what currently takes a day to get to Britain could take a day-and-a-half — a dramatic increase for a system whose margins of error are measured in minutes. They also fear the roads leading to the ports will turn into parking lots. At present, there is no overflow space for trucks that cannot be driven straight onto ships. There has been no need.

“It’s like a queue in the supermarket. If the queue gets just a little bit larger than the capacity of the cashiers, the queue expands exponentially,” said Pieter Omtzigt, a Dutch lawmaker who is responsible for his country’s Brexit preparations. 

Hult said ferry operators such as hers were ready to find ways to speed any customs checks — if only they knew what to expect.

“The challenge here is the lack of clarity,” she said. “If there’s certainty about what the framework is going to look like, and if the systems are there, we can act quite fast.” 

The agencies that will have to do the inspections are bracing for complications.

“The feeling is that we are doing what we can to be prepared as possible, but I won’t say that there won’t be any incidents in the first weeks,” said Jan Meijer, director of inspection at the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority.

Dutch authorities estimate that 35,000 small and medium-size Dutch businesses do business with Britain but have no experience with customs, since they keep their commerce inside the E.U. They would either have to navigate the complicated new terrain or cut off ties to Britain. The government is trying to get them ready. It is as if Illinois businesses suddenly need to contend with an international frontier to trade with Indiana — and have less than three months to figure out how to do so.

“If we are preparing and companies are not preparing, then everything breaks down,” said Nanette van Schelven, the director general of the Dutch customs authority. The agency has been running disaster drills to prepare for chaos.

“That’s basically the motto of this government: Hope for the best and prepare for the worst,” she said.

But Dutch policymakers are nervous that Dutch businesses may still be too complacent.

“There’s still a lot of rationalizing going around, saying, ‘Things surely wouldn’t get that bad, would they?’ ” said Rem Korteweg, a senior research fellow at Clingendael, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations, who has advised Dutch lawmakers and businesses about preparations for Brexit. “There’s a lot of wishful thinking going around, and that’s a problem.”

2184,"&gt; First of all, I speak a blend of both, since my mother is from the republic and my father from Iranian Azerbaijan. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_language#Azerbaijani_vs._Turkish

Then you know that:

&gt;  North Azerbaijani and South Azerbaijani have significant differences in phonology, lexicon, morphology, syntax, and loanwords.[7]

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Secondly, I believe its well known that southern Azerbaijani is EVEN easier to understand as Anatolian turk. 

Again a source for that? Well known by whom? There is no turkish TV in Iran, unlike azerbaidjan? There are no turkish schools in Iran either again unlike Azerbaidjan. 

No to mention that some words have a different pronounciation. 

Take the word ayaqqabi in Azeri. Turkish pronounce it Ayakkabi while Southern azeris pronounce it ayaqqabi written as آیاق‌قابی thus with the voices uvular stop that doesn't exist in turkish. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_uvular_stop

https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%82%E2%80%8C%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%DB%8E#Azerbaijani

“Kosher slaughter, shechita, involves cutting the trachea and esophagus with a sharp, flawless knife. At the same time, the carotid arteries, which are the primary supplier of blood to the brain, are severed. The profound loss of blood and the massive drop in blood pressure render the animal insensate almost immediately. Studies done by Dr. H. H. Dukes at the Cornell University School of Veterinary Medicine indicate that the animal is unconscious within seconds of the incision.”..”It should be kept in mind that in a non-kosher plant, when the animal is killed by a shot with a captive bolt to the brain, it often has to be re-shot, sometimes up to six times, before the animal collapses.

* Some people were double-charged when they tried to buy an eVignette online
* Policemen have no way to check if someone bought an E-vignette
* The new system **does not** support cash payments making it very hard for rural residents
* Government bought a fleet of new VW Touaregs for the Directors of the newly created monitoring agency, though - at least they managed to do that successfully
* The company that was hired to implement the system pocketed 180m for the project, and is suspected in under-paying social securities of employees

When people are a problem we have solutions in place.

You can easily protest and be a good person. If you don't understand that, then what ever you protest will never be justified because you seem to think that burning down peoples' houses is the same as taking the system down.

If rights are being trampled upon I am more than happy to stick up for those rights but as soon as you decide to trample on mine I'll push you to the ground and hold you there until you learn how to be human.

I'm so fucking done with this species. We preach equality but demand to swing the equality stick the other way fully. Then get bitchy when people explain that isn't what true equality is about.

That’s just stupid.

It is also incorrect to think that the country was set up so that each state could be “independent” of the federal government. In fact the first constitutional document that tied the 13 original states together, the Articles of Confederation, failed because it was too weak and did not tie the states tightly enough together. Our current Constitution, which replace the Articles of Confederation, was intended to tie the stage together more tightly. The Founding Fathers were making a country, not a loose confederation of 13 independent states.

Sure. My argument doesn’t necessitate that conclusion.

At the same time, the evidence you’ve provided doesn’t necessitate the conclusion that the majority of Europeans view Muslims as a whole to be a negative group.

It is very possible that respondents in that survey were opposed to further Muslim immigration for fear of terrorist infiltration or some other security threat specific to the times in which the survey was conducted.

The survey was not about their opinions of the average Muslim person.

ROTTERDAM, Netherlands — The Hook of Holland, a stretch of land outside Rotterdam sliced by canals, functions in many ways like Britain’s backyard. Greenhouses stretch for miles, nurturing tulips, tomatoes and other supermarket specialties. The bounty is gathered into warehouses and sorted under signs denoting destinations such as Sheffield and Gateshead. Then trucks whisk it all onto ferries headed across the North Sea.

Thanks to this precisely calibrated ecosystem and the European Union’s borderless trading zone, British shops can order fresh produce early in the morning and receive it by the end of the day.

But a no-deal Brexit threatens to throw it all into chaos, resulting in trucks backed up for miles, vegetables spoiled and economic pain for everyone.

The Netherlands — Britain’s main trading partner on mainland Europe — is among the most-prepared for the possibility that Britons will leave the E.U. on March 29 without a deal to manage the withdrawal. Leaders here fear that the best efforts of a nation that loves to be prepared may not be enough to safeguard against the mess. And Britain’s other trading partnerships in Europe could be even worse off.

“Everyone is fully aware that something is going to happen,” said Mark Dijk, the head of external relations at the Port of Rotterdam, whose docks, rail yards and warehouses handle nearly 1 million tons of goods moving to and from Britain every week. The port has been working on Brexit emergency plans for more than a year and is trying to alert businesses that they need to brace for a wave of restrictions.

Britain’s efforts to manage the withdrawal “are so chaotic that it’s hard for people to be sure there won’t be a [no-deal] Brexit,” Dijk said.

No precedent exists for a country scissoring itself out of the interconnected modern world. And yet that outcome appears increasingly likely, as the British Parliament prepares to resume debate on a draft withdrawal agreement that has meager support.


In a no-deal scenario, London’s powerful banks could find themselves in legal limbo when they want to trade in Europe’s market. Millions of British citizens who have lived and worked in the E.U. legally for years, as well as E.U. nationals in Britain, could suddenly become undocumented. Connections between British and European law enforcement agencies would go dark.

British leaders have warned of shortages of food and medicines, and they have asked importers to build stockpiles. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson has put 3,500 troops on standby to deal with potential disruptions. In all, cabinet ministers have approved $2.5 billion of contingency spending.

The countries that will remain in the E.U. also are amping up their no-deal preparations. Irish lawmakers may have to set aside all other business this month to pass 45 pieces of emergency legislation aimed at mitigating the impact of Brexit. France is building roads, warehouses and checkpoints near its ports in preparation for new customs controls.

The E.U.’s headquarters in Brussels unveiled a list of proposals to protect E.U. citizens from the worst consequences of a no-deal Brexit, but that would offer little relief to the British side. British airlines, for example, would be able to carry passengers to E.U. airports only from Britain.

Here in the Netherlands, exports to Britain could fall by 17 percent if Brexit happens without a deal, according to a study from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The Dutch government is scrambling to limit the damage, hiring nearly 1,000 more customs agents for the inspections that would become necessary. The agency, whose officials inspect meat, dairy and animals, is scouring Eastern Europe for veterinarians and giving them crash courses in Dutch because they cannot find enough qualified people at home. And a legion of Dutch farmers and flower growers who take orders from British customers are worried that their supply lines could get tangled in bureaucratic knots.

“It’s all fresh, so you need to be able to deliver on very short notice,” said Pim Leenheer, who works in sales at a Dutch company, DailyFresh Logistics, that organizes food and flower shipments to Britain.

The process goes quickly in part because no customs agents are involved. In 1993, countries that belonged to what was then called the European Economic Community pulled down their customs posts and stopped checks between countries.

Little would change if British lawmakers approve the withdrawal deal negotiated by the E.U. and Prime Minister Theresa May. Britain would remain inside the E.U. customs union at least until new trade agreements are devised.

But Britain’s leaving with no deal in place would set trade back decades.

“All of a sudden, you’re going to have certain checks,” Hult said.

Businesses would need to file paperwork with E.U. and British customs agencies when they want to send shipments between countries. Food and animals would need inspections on both sides. Truck drivers already pass through passport checks, since Britain is not a member of Europe’s passport-free travel area, but the post-Brexit checks would be far stricter. Dutch lawmakers are digging into their archives to figure out which old treaties with Britain might still be in force. Some date to the 1940s and 1950, when Europe was rebuilding after World War II.

Some shipping and logistics companies expect that what currently takes a day to get to Britain could take a day-and-a-half — a dramatic increase for a system whose margins of error are measured in minutes. They also fear the roads leading to the ports will turn into parking lots. At present, there is no overflow space for trucks that cannot be driven straight onto ships. There has been no need.

“It’s like a queue in the supermarket. If the queue gets just a little bit larger than the capacity of the cashiers, the queue expands exponentially,” said Pieter Omtzigt, a Dutch lawmaker who is responsible for his country’s Brexit preparations. 

Hult said ferry operators such as hers were ready to find ways to speed any customs checks — if only they knew what to expect.

“The challenge here is the lack of clarity,” she said. “If there’s certainty about what the framework is going to look like, and if the systems are there, we can act quite fast.” 

The agencies that will have to do the inspections are bracing for complications.

“The feeling is that we are doing what we can to be prepared as possible, but I won’t say that there won’t be any incidents in the first weeks,” said Jan Meijer, director of inspection at the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority.

Dutch authorities estimate that 35,000 small and medium-size Dutch businesses do business with Britain but have no experience with customs, since they keep their commerce inside the E.U. They would either have to navigate the complicated new terrain or cut off ties to Britain. The government is trying to get them ready. It is as if Illinois businesses suddenly need to contend with an international frontier to trade with Indiana — and have less than three months to figure out how to do so.

“If we are preparing and companies are not preparing, then everything breaks down,” said Nanette van Schelven, the director general of the Dutch customs authority. The agency has been running disaster drills to prepare for chaos.

“That’s basically the motto of this government: Hope for the best and prepare for the worst,” she said.

But Dutch policymakers are nervous that Dutch businesses may still be too complacent.

“There’s still a lot of rationalizing going around, saying, ‘Things surely wouldn’t get that bad, would they?’ ” said Rem Korteweg, a senior research fellow at Clingendael, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations, who has advised Dutch lawmakers and businesses about preparations for Brexit. “There’s a lot of wishful thinking going around, and that’s a problem.”",Barcelona,/r/europe/comments/add25o/the_dutch_love_to_plan_but_even_they_may_not_be/edg8o26/,THVAQLJZawkw8iCKEZAE,1546839007

2551,"&gt;(...) reconstructions of Viollet-le-Duc (...) (...) Saxon Palace is rebuilt (...) (...) A part of Frankfurt was recently razed and rebuilt (...) (...)  pretty much every reconstruction in western europe  (...)

Yes, reconstructions are fine, because they don't fake the history, they just restore what was lost due to tragic events of the past. Nowhere in Europe was anything in pseudo-traditional style built anew. On the other hand - there are many modern projects that are inspired by local shapes and forms, materials and colours, but you're too blinded with hate to notice that. 

&gt; And it's not just reconstructions, this one was built just a few years  ago. It's quite popular and looks great not at all inauthentic.  

It looks extremely inauthentic and it's in bad taste. There are dozens of ways to design something modern in in form, respecting the local architecture. 

[Aura Gdansk](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic2.s-trojmiasto.pl%2Fzdj%2Fc%2F12%2F103%2F1000x0%2F1036283-__kr.jpg&amp;f=1) \- Shape refers to medieval granaries of Gdansk, red colour of the facade - to brick, very common in this part of Europe.   
[Planned building on Granary Island](https://www.gdansk.pl/download/2018-08/112345.jpg) \- brick, shape, gothic-like arches on the first floor, delicate ornamentation all over the building.

[Granaria Gdansk](https://www.immobelpoland.com/pl/rimage/pivot_half_1280/image/909) \- again, shape, facade is white so is neutral since it's facing the historic part of Gdansk head-on. Also the project includes reconstruction of the historic granary - the small, rick one.  


XIX century architecture wasn't that unique anyway, it was everywhere pretty much the same, and in the beginning of XX century people hated it because it was ugly and kitschy. That's why modernism was born and gained momentum.

2664,"This is pretty misinformed. Mesoamerica was one of the only 3 places in the world to have independently invented writing, our earliest example of writing in the region dates back to the Olmec in around 900 BC, almost 2500 years before contact with Europeans.

Obviously, most Mesoamerican books and documents were burned by the Spainish, but we still have ample amounts of sources even if it's a fraction of what we could have had: Much of Aztec society and history and wars was re-recorded by Spanish friars interviewing Aztec elders, and by Aztec's and their descendents in the colional period. The Maya, meanwhile, left comprehenesive, albiet very dry and matter-of-fact records of wars, construction projects, the birth, deaths, and ascensions of royalty, political marriages, etc in stone inscriptions that survived the Spansih biblocaust. We have some surviving Mixtec books detailing the political histories of a few valleys down in their region in Oaxaca/Guerrero, including the conquests of 8-Deer-Jaguar-Claw, who unified the Mixtec city-states into an empire in the 11th century, and we have various other documents here and there recording histories of other states like the Purepecha Empire, the Republic of Tlaxcala, etc.

In other words, while it's true that much of what records that existed are gone, the idea that nothing is left is false. We still have thousands of pages of documents worth, and we have records of plenty of battles and wars that could have been used, had OP not just used Wikipedia but delved into other sources.

Combining that with the fact that a castizo can be up to (1+3S)/4 native, where S is the maximum amount of native a spaniard can have, then given enough generations an almost full-blooded native could be a spaniard...

One of the first things Hitler did was to destroy Germany's federal structure to build an empire with a strong central leadership. The reason why Erdogan wants to change Turkey into a system with a powerful president is because he has imperialist neo-Ottoman ambitions. The EU has shown unity when it has to, for example during the Brexit talks, but in normal times, there is a high barrier to decisions. For example, the EU would never have decided to invade Iraq. As is shown by the Iraq invasion, the ability to make a quick decision is not always an advantage. Democratic processes can be time-consuming; however, in the end they produce the best results.

2691,"So i knew a lot of really bright international students from the commonwealth who really struggled to get a partial scholarship at Russel Group level UK universities and there were are fair amount of grants/bursaries available to them. Honestly for an undergraduate degree your only chance would be a scholarship through a company or through your government.

However, masters degrees have a lot more funding available to them. Some of the more wider known programs such as the [Chevening Scholarship](https://www.chevening.org/) seem to cover Bosnia and Herzegovina however its always worth checking with the individual universities as they will likely have funded positions available especially within the field of Computer Science, usually these will cover your tuition fees along with a bursary payment ranging from £10k-20k for cost of living and such.

This would obvious raise the question of where you do your BSc however one thing to note a few people i know who went to their local countries universities then went on to do a masters at Cambridge, when it comes to applying for jobs you just put your highest qualification, ie you put MSc Cambridge Computer Science which is what employers see and care about. It also depends on what rank of University you want to go to, top 50 and in Europe you are looking at the UK or Switzerland (not sure if EPFL teaches in English, i assume they do). If your willing to go top 200 or 250 more places in Europe open up for you and it might be easier to get funding. Also when applying for a masters providing you got a 2:1 or above in your BSc they will care much more about your personal development, what projects you are involved in, dedication ect going to a lower university to get a BSc will not stop you applying and getting a place at a good university for an MSc.

but it is true that you do have rich countries economies growing and benefiting from the cheap ""brain drain"" of others, while providing for their own less fortunate, 

yet at the same time forcing those other countries economy to shrink, (through austerity,  lack of public spending) and leave their citizens zero assistance for lack of employment etc.  

so when they argue that they need a boost in their economy to get out of the situation, (which they would have been able to get if it wasn't for the euro) and so they can also take care of the joblessness, or if anything so they are at least competing with the other EU countries **on the same level** and they get told to get fucked by Brussels..

2741,"I never said it goes to corruption. I just said it doesn't all go to solving collective problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take retirement, for example. Like 90% of the French retirement system is funded by government programs. That's not just a collective issue. People can also save for their own retirement. In the US or UK only like 30% of people's retirement needs are met by government retirement systems and people save the other money they need themselves in tax advantaged retirement accounts or by building equity in their homes by paying off mortgages. 

&amp;#x200B;

A consequence of that is that France has exponentially higher payroll taxes on the middle class in order to fund a bloated retirement system. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just because you collectivize an issue, doesn't mean it's a collective problem. A collective problem is like building a road through a town because that effects everyone equally. Saving for retirement is very much an individual issue because people retire and need money individually.

2821,"Well, I know for once (I can't source my claims atm as I am recalling all the papers and textbooks chapters we were told to read during our International Economic History course back in University two years ago) that there are a couple of factors that kickstarted industrialization in the UK (And if you look at some other regions, they also share the same factors varying a little bit):

-The amassed capital and finance sector created due to trading allowed early industrialists to access credit and finance their operations (The Dutch helped with this).

-There was a degree of tolerance for scientific research

-There was a degree of tolerance for a new social class that would outrank or match aristocrats and traders

-The resources needed for early machines and their operation were found in abundance in the vicinity and they were not extremely expensive (Coal and iron).

-Due to the black death that tormented Europe, population levels dwindled and thus farmers received higher wages and feudal lords lost the amount of power they had giving more place to traders (related to the first point I mentioned).

-The UK had a cluster of big cities centered around the countryside with short travel times with also almost instant access to the sea giving the opportunity to lower trading costs and thus lower their products prices (= bigger market to sell to).

I can't recall or remember quite right the political ones. I know there was something going on after Cromwell's revolution but I can't nail and I don't want to put something that is incorrect.

If you look at the other places and the time at which they industrialized you will they share some of the points I mentioned here. ",,/r/europe/comments/ad6i5v/spread_of_the_industrial_revolution_in_europe/edeteu6/,Megustoelbertolucci,1546805715

&gt; The Soviet rule was a crime against international law - it was illegal... Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania legally *restored* their pre-occupation states. 

Some UN members recognised Baltics as part of USSR, some did not. Discussion about de jure status of these states might be important, but it's a different topic. De facto they were part of Russian Empire, then part of USSR.

&gt; You make way too simplistic assumptions about these countries, without really understanding a thing or two about them 

Right, apparently I don't understand even one thing. But what's so simplistic here? Being de facto a part of a country for more than 250 years does not impact a state, but being a couple of decades a socialist country makes and overwhelming impact, that how you make non simplistic argument?

&gt; Doesn't make it right to assume they have culturally much in common with other countries in this group   
&gt;  
&gt; I cannot really agree that the socialist era had strong cultural influences. The influences were mainly social and they will disappear within a few generations.  

We probably have different notions of what a culture is. Let's take a definition from Wikipedia. ""Culture (/ˈkʌltʃər/) is the social behavior and norms found in human societies"". Social influences are cultural influences. Just the fact that countries are in one group on OP map means that there are some cultural similarities between them. Doesn't mean the cultures are totally identical in everything.

&gt; Plus you group together very different influences. Originally Slavic nations, a millennia of Orthodox religion, and 50 years of Soviet occupation. That's a pretty grave difference... 

USSR culturally was a continuation of Russian Empire which was Slavic/orthodox. There were a lot of new cultural features for sure, but I don't see why it should be regarded as something totally disconnected.

And we talk about Slavic and Ortodox influences because these are among the main influences in the East of Europe. 

&gt; You either include all post-socialist countries into one group and exclude Greece or make this about some other sub-influence like Orthodox countries and include Greece, but exclude some others. 

The group that we examine is East of Europe, because countries here have some common features as it is shown on the map. There are different factors that create that picture, not just one. Historically Greek influence mixed with local cultures was probably the main one though.

And Greece is an example that ""only communist influence is relevant"" theory does not quite work.

&gt; You are not a scientist, I see. 

Apparently mathematical statistics that uses terms like ""correlation"" and ""regularity"" is not a science.

&gt; I might believe these results, but not for all of these countries (because they belong to different cultural regions) and only if there was some good research into it. 

What good research? You can't take a football team of a nation and see what names there are? You don't trust yourself, only certified scientists in this specific field?

Hungary might be exception because it is always exception. Baltics probably as well, although there are probably half of Russians in the teams there. The others should fit pretty well.

&gt; Yet you use this as a basis for determining their group in Europe...

2920,"&gt;since I do not understand the context and the precedents. 

I think nobody does. Italian internal affairs have always been some kind of fucked-up experimental comedy.

&gt;How often have members of the SHC been changed in the past? 

Very often, it's normal to change them. What is not normal is to do that before their mandate ends, which would have been in 2 years.

&gt;Who are the new members? 

There are none, the minister just sent away anyone she could send away (part of the council is formed by presidents of other health institutions, so those are fixed, but following these events part of them resigned)

&gt;Are they anti-vaxxers, or just people that are more aligned with the new government's political stance? 

As I said, there are no new members for now, but the members weren't politically chosen, and that's how it should be. The council is an authority the predates even the health ministry itself and is formed based solely on scientific prowess.  

&gt;About your ""without any warning"" remark, is it customary to give warnings in these cases?

I guess it is customary to at least meet with the council once I guess? The president of the council, like any other member, was really surprised when they received the letter in the morning. The SHC is the main counselling body of the minister, and yet she never called a meeting since June, when the government started.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There is a deep conflict between the scientific community in Italy and  political / judiciary institutions which dates back decades

Yes, no one could ever deny that. I think this is the first time the government is against science/academy/youth/education not only in facts and policy, but even in words, openly degrading both the value and the reliability of knowledge.

&gt; it is not as bad or universal as it is often made out to be 

As an Italian I can tell you that the universality of it is greatly overplayed, but that that it is also much worse than what it is believed.

2927,"&gt; Do you think that if 500k people moved to the UK over a period of 4 years we would say ""the UK has been ruined"" ? Or 3m people to America, or 400k to Spain ? It's a high number of people, but if that's whatb it takes to tip off the scales it means everything was about to fall off either way.

No idea. It's a rather random and context lacking questions. 

&gt; Yeah, they're thinking about the statistical representation of higher standards of living. 

Adding more workforce doesn't rise the standards of living, it keeps the wage down, doing exactly the opposite of what you pretend they are aiming. low cost workforce heavily profits to the top class. 

&gt; If you want to factor in ""muh culture"" then I'm gonna need some explanation as to why 1% of the population with ruin the party for the other 99%.

Because that gives munition for the far right, I thought it was clear enough to not have to say that... Nobody wants to get a mass of people that are foreign to their culture because the EU said so. If you want to keep your Ostrich stance because it was written in the EU texts that 0.001% of the population has read, go on. That's how you break the EU.

&gt; Yes, it turns out that if you create institutions in your country that enable a healthy and powerful economy to grow then your country develops with time, crazy I know. Germany didn't profit ""from"" anyone as if they took advantage of shit lol. While Italy, Spain and Greece were too busy passing nonsensical reforms Germany was strenghening its economy. When things eventually go south is it really a surprise to see them on top ? It doesn't mean they ""profited from"" Europe or the Euro lol

I'm not sure about Spain, Italy and Greece, their current economical situation is not what I was referring to. You can't ask every country to turn into Germany, the problem is that the Euro zone has grown as a inflexible zone, that doesn't take into account every kind of economy, because yeah there are other type of economy that are as valid. Germany would have not been able to export and grow up like it is today if every country went the some way it has actually.

Pôvodný význam názvu bol** ***osada ľudu Košových*****.** Postavenie osoby *Koša* je však neznáme. Mohol to byť starešina osady, alebo už ranofeudálny pán. Zjavne išlo o veľmi autoritatívnu osobu, keď sa jeho meno ujalo pre pomenovanie tejto čulej trhovej osady a jej okolitého zázemia. Hypotézu slovanského pôvodu mena Košíc podporuje i skutočnosť, že meno *Košice* majú aj niektoré iné obce-osady v Čechách a na Slovensku, napr. aj v Poľsku.

2994,"&gt; Adding more workforce doesn't rise the standards of living, it keeps the wage down, doing exactly the opposite of what you pretend they are aiming. low cost workforce heavily profits to the top class.

That's some good /r/badeconomics I've ever seen it, so let me R1 you real quick.

What you're saying is known as the Lump of Labour Fallacy. When immigrants come to a certain country, they raise not only the offer of labour, but the demand as well. Essentially, immigrants need jobs but they also need clothes, food, transportation, education, entertainment, health, etc.

There are many empirical studies about this, the vast majority prove this idea with factual data. One study quite relevant for the situation here given the similarities is [this one](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2523702?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

Focus on the part where ""The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier.""

&gt; Well since they didn't even try to change it, that point becomes invalid no ?

Not really ? 

Firstly, changing international treaties decades old is hard as fuck. Secondly, you're the one claiming that it's a bad treaty and that countries should be able to freely refuse refugees. All I said is that Germany followed the treaty and that they shouldn't just ignore things like that. I never said they should've changed it.

&gt; Push for less reliance on gas for Russia, push for protectionism against China.

I agreed about the Russia thing, I just questioned the China one. And your idea is god awful lmao.

How is lowering the standards of living for the average European gonna help anything ? The economy should serve the individual, not the other way around.

Free trade is good and protectionism is bad, and this applies to China as well. 

&gt; Because that gives munition for the far right, I thought it was clear enough to not have to say that... Nobody wants to get a mass of people that are foreign to their culture because the EU said so. If you want to keep your Ostrich stance because it was written in the EU texts that 0.001% of the population has read, go on. That's how you break the EU.

The far-right has been growing in Europe since the late 70s, the change in migration flows hardly explains it. Most likely it has to do with liberalism (as in the defence of liberal democracies) becoming a bit too technocratic and the public opinion following the new hip ideology. Also, the EU didn't force refugees or migrants onto anyone.

&gt; You can't ask every country to turn into Germany

Why not ?

&gt; the problem is that the Euro zone has grown as a inflexible zone

The problem is that national governments refuse to give up some sovereignty in order to improve our lives lol. The next step in € integration is the convergence of fiscal policies by governments, and I don't see how anyone is to blame for this not happening except for the governments that refuse to do it.

&gt;  there are other type of economy that are as valid

From a moral POV ? I guess so. Unless your economy is based on slavery I'd say it's valid.

But valid as in ""it's fine, no worries"" ? Absolutely not lol. Running huge deficits, keeping institutions outdated, etc are not valid ways to manage an economy.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ad6clu/just_found_this_image_of_the_g8_summit_of_2007_in/edeik3e/,130818,1546799804
2995,"&gt; Or you could still build beautiful buildings by spending 10% more and imposing a height restriction. Not like Poland suddenly lost all architectural knowledge after the war.

You can't, because commieblocks were shat all over that area in 60s and 70s, and to demolish them you would have to spend hundreds of millions to buy them out from their inhabitants.

&gt;more and imposing a height restriction

Height restriction is the last thing we want in Warsaw, because commies built a 230m high skyscraper in 1950s, and we definitely don't want it to be the only thing *sticking out* in our city center.

&gt;It's the complete disregard for aesthetics that causes the cities to be turned into industrial-looking shitholes.

There are still hoops to jump through, practice appears to be somewhat different (something that is true for all EU countries..) but again, employers seem to offer transition courses that last from anything from 3 months to a year.

I also think that would empeach scientific advancement, because if you only base yourself on what you produce as scientific knowledge and what your neighbours do, a lot of what you might dicover or what people on the other side of the world might discover too wont be shared.

&gt; Point about cultures is just sign of you not understanding culture :D For example cultures in colder places are much more productive per hour than cultures in warmer climate, because cold climate gives smaller window to produce crops. Because of this cultures in colder climates may develop more strict worker protection rights to stop with too much exploitation. The same rules don't have to be even written in warmer climates, because it is possible there to produce crops almost constantly.

The world left the agrarian stage a few centuries ago ... Maybe it's time to update your thinking.

In your mind, that was the only point I made. You have yet to properly respond and actually CITE ""left wing chaos"" or how police sit on their hands when leftists are ""destructive"". You have failed to cite an organisation or political body, except ""universities and exarcheia"", of which I'm yet to experience any so called ""chaos"".

What is truly sad is that you think Greeks don't think your attitudes are appalling simply because they are Greek.

Anyone who has ever encountered Golden Dawn knows the ilk who support them, and I'd go as far as to none of them are centre-right wing people turned Nazi because of ""left wing chaos"". You are pushing an agenda, and suggesting to further punish people, in order to appease Golden Dawn followers to return to the ""healthy"" conservatism of the past, which you conveniently forgot to mention included white terror and a military dictatorship.  


Again, your assertions are wrong, your suggestion is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and your opinions indicate to me you are an ideologue.  


&gt;You keep on screaming that i am exhibiting far right beliefs while advicating against both the far left and the far right

""we must stop Golden Dawn by doing exactly what they would like the Government to do"". Sure thing.

Generally they do not care about the economic benefits. They care about immigrants, refugees and the absolute right to self-government. Not to mention national identities are a very dear thing to many. 

Until the EU addresses these issues, there will always be a very vocal opposition to the EU. 




You have to remember, these people are (in very general terms) not that educated and have jobs they will only seek out in their home country.  Just about every EU program does them no good, they do not need the right to free movement and they do not belive they will suffer greatly from leaving said goods and benefits.  

For all they are concerned, they see some fatcats in Brussels make decisions they feel they have no  influence on. They see immigrants taking jobs that could (in theory) go to someone else. They see headlines with refugees causing trouble. They see gangs in the street who are coloured and cauaing even more trouble. 

Yes, you and I know its not all like that, but that is their worldview (again I am painting in broad and generel strokes here).

In January 2010, he was involved in the attempted robbery of a currency exchange office, where he shot at police with a Kalashnikov rifle while providing a lookout for his accomplices. **One police officer was shot in the leg but survived.** 

**The Mayor of Brussels, Freddy Thielemans, and the Mayor of Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Philippe Moureaux, described the shooting as a ""fait divers"" (a small daily news item) and ""normal in a large city""**, causing controversy.

Later in 2010, **Ibrahim was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but was released on parole in 2014 under the condition that he did not leave the country for longer than a month. Following his release from prison, he collected €25,000 in Belgian government benefits until December 2015.** ",Romania,/r/europe/comments/ad1j83/belgium_bans_ritual_animal_slaughter_some_see_a/eddgve9/,NotBruce_,1546770418

What about him ? He turned a war torn china that was led by feudal warlords into a unified entity who is rivaling US today. Mao's reforms made china into the giant it is today.

&gt; Enver Hoxa? 

Again, what did enver hoxha do wrong ? he obsessively built a lot of bunkers and shit sure but other than that he was a fairly competent leader. He raised adult literacy rate from 5% to 98% in albania.

&gt; Castro?

Castro was a great leader, and led cuba to its freedom. Batista was selling the entire country to americans and many cubans were left unemployed and hungry from the change. Castro has effectively made sure the people of cuba were literate healthy and employed, all three of which he was largely successful in. Sure Cuba isn't a world superpower now, but to expect cuba to be that would be a bit silly anyway. Also fun fact, cuban average lifespan is longer than the average lifespan of a US citizen.

&gt; Show me one succesful communist regime.

Literally all of the ones you list ? China is huge, soviets were a massive upgrade over tsar russia, Cuba was a success, and are currently doing fine for a latin american country, Albania was a huge upgrade afteraxis collaborator regimes and so on. Show me one failed communist regime, where a country was doing fine but after it went communist it started having massive economic problems, or have regressed in discernible way.

3459,"I am a staunch **pro-vaccines** supporter. This being said, I am also **extremely annoyed by fake news**, so I googled the name to double check the claims. The actual events appear to be quite different than how the independent summarises them.

1. He stepped down a few weeks ago shortly after he was accused of a conflict of interest. While he was Health Chief, he was member of different organisations, and was payed as a consultant in vaccine evaluation projects funded by pharmaceutical companies: AbbVie, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Menarini, Pfizer, Astellas Pharma, Amgen Dompè, Wyeth Lederle, Sano Pasteur. He was also a scientific editor for a journal called Public Health and Health Policy, owned by a *lobbying* company for pharmaceuticals called Altis OPS, which concerns itself with market access, promotion, and product launch of pharmaceuticals.

2. These (potential) conflicts of interest were listed in a conflict of interests statement that he had to submit for a job at the European Union, but they were not inserted in the CV that he submitted when he was made Health Chief.

3. He wasn't a politically neutral figure in the Ministry of Health. He had run to be elected as an MP in the past (he failed), and he was aligned with the Democratic Party, as he attended regularly the party's festivals as a speaker. So the disagreements may go well beyond vaccinations.

These conflicts of interest were revealed on 7th December 2018, and he stepped down as health chief about a week later.

3496,"&gt;They see the chaos in universities, places like exarcheia along with other incidents and go with literally the only party that vows to stop those things.

A small anarchist community in Athens is causing concern for ordinary Greeks? What bullshit  


&gt;Especially since the incidents caused by Golden Dawn mostly dont affect the average greek

No, ordinary people do not turn to a gang of Neo-Nazis, who threaten and violently attack immigrants, homosexuals, and anyone opposed to their sick brand of Nazism.  


&gt;some cases of police involvement doesnt mean there are no other situations where police involvement is minimal

You really think that if the police are willing to raid a harmless squat, they would sit on their hands at ""left wing chaos""?. You have given me nothing but unverifiable anecdotes, and I don't buy it.  


&gt;I dont see how agreeing with some positions of the conservative party in the Unites States makes me an extremist

The Republican party is seen as a joke by every other conservative party and leader of the world, bar Bolsonaro and Netanyahu, which says a lot. Furthermore, /r/The_Donald is not simply a pro-Republican forum, it is a known cesspool of white supremacists who advocate for violence against various demographics and individuals. You're not a moderate.  


&gt;All I see is a butthurt person who refuses to accept that there are people with opposite points of views and insults them by calling them low lifes.

White supremacists and Neo-cons spreading lies for their reactionary agenda is not simply ""opposing views"". The entire subreddit is full of low lives, including you.  


&gt;Comservative parties in Greece ARE healthy

Shifting the goal posts, you claimed they WERE healthy, conveniently ignoring the long history of white terror orchestrated against ""anarchocommunists"", including against EAM-ELAS fighters who liberated most of Greece after WW2, and again during the Junta.  


&gt;if you think that going full totalitarian mode against them is the answer

Where did I say the solution to Golden Dawn is through totalitarianism?  


&gt;calling me a fascist for playing ww2 games and picking many countries including the fascist ones

I'm calling you a fascist sympathizer because you are advocating for police crack downs on left wing people on vague premises like ""left wing chaos"" (with no solid examples), whilst exhibiting various far right wing beliefs and behaviours. One of those odd behaviours is your apparent interest in playinga fascist Greece, and advising others to ""go fascist asap"".  


&gt;As your flair says Australian I would say that first of all I AM GLAD that you arent Greek

Do you honestly think an Anglo-Australian takes this much interest in modern Greek history? I'm a fucking Greek living in Australian, if you rubbed two brain cells together you would've figured that out, and I find you and every other far-right wing Greek a complete embarrassment. I feel embarrassed when Australians comment on Golden Dawn and I feel embarrassed when morons like you say we need to appease them by targeting leftists because of an undescribed ""chaos"".  


&gt;but Greeks are the last people on Earth who would consider me a disgrace because i disagree with your totalitarian and fascist like approaches to combat nazism and extremism.

Nowhere have I said how Greece should combat Nazism, all I have said is you are full of shit, and twisting the truth for your reactionary agenda. As a Greek, you are a disgrace.

You are very confused, my man:
&gt;In this survey, publics were asked whether having an increasing number of people of many different races, ethnic groups and nationalities

Different ethnic groups and nationalities includes Europeans, Muslims, Africans, and everyone else, therefore it cannot refute my argument that Europeans by majority see Muslims as a positive group.

&gt;Well xenophobia is very easy to understand. The ignorant become fearful of things they don’t understand.

Oh, so you understand the Qur'an and how terrible it is, along with that Pew research poll done about how a significant portion of Muslims have backwards beliefs?

Hahahaha

&gt;We could take France and how their World Cup winning national team is like half Muslim Africans and they were the pride of the nation. So much so that the French Government went on a tirade about how Muslims and Africans of French broth and citizenship are French, period.

&gt;Or the universal praise of African Muslim Mamadou Gassama after he heroically saved that boy from falling.

Are you going to stop desperately trying to prove a point with anecdotes and provide statistics regarding how the European mass feels towards these wonderful groups?

&gt;So you now agree that it is unethical to bar people from entering a country on the mere basis of race and religion? Pretty hard self-own there buddy.

You failed to explain how South Africa oppressing Black people entitled to their country is equivalent to Europe discriminating people who have nothing to do with Europe and are not European from entering their own country.

&gt;Apart from space heating, one of Iceland's oldest and most important usages of geothermal energy is for heating greenhouses. For years, naturally warm soil has been used for growing potatoes and other vegetables. Heating greenhouses using geothermal energy began in Iceland in 1924. The majority of Iceland's greenhouses are located in the south, and most are enclosed in glass. It is common to use inert growing media (volcanic scoria, rhyolite) on concrete floors with individual plant watering. Geothermal steam is commonly used to boil and disinfect the soil. The increasing use of electric lighting in recent years has extended the growing season and improved greenhouse utilization. This development has been encouraged through governmental subsidies spent on electricity for lighting.

However, there is never a time you can tell me that blocking an ambulance doesn't matter, but before you say anything hear me out. 

You're sitting at home having a nice family dinner with your grandma and all of the sudden, she's clutching her chest screaming in pain. 

She's having a heart attack. What do you do? You call 911. ambulances have great response times in urban centers so your confident that the medical team will get there and be able to give her (blood thinners? Idk not a doctor)

However it's been 10 minutes since you called and their still not their. Grandma's condition is worsening. After 20 minutes they finally show up but it was too late as grandma had died due to the heart attack. 

The paramedics informed you their sorry and they could have saved her but they couldn't get to her quick enough as people were blocking the road. 


Now you go ahead and try and tell me that this is :

&gt;infinitesimal, virtually inconsequential non-issue

Blocking ambulances is a HUGE issue. Sure the person they are trying to go save may not be related to you. But they are related to someone and it is just downright awful of people to potentially cause someone to lose their life due to them deciding to block an ambulance.

&gt;Weekend after weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron is dealing with sometimes violent protests from a populist movement known as the gilets jaunes (yellow vests). The protesters were galvanized by a plan to raise gasoline taxes, but they are still out in the streets even though the gas tax increase has been suspended. Now they’re demanding, among other things, default on the public debt, exit from the European Union and NATO, and less immigration. I’m dealing with a piece of the online fallout — and in the process learning a dispiriting lesson about how hard it is for a political leader to pursue a moderate path in an age of extremes

We could take France and how their World Cup winning national team is like half Muslim Africans and they were the pride of the nation. So much so that the French Government went on a tirade about how Muslims and Africans of French broth and citizenship are French, period.

Or the universal praise of African Muslim Mamadou Gassama after he heroically saved that boy from falling.


&gt; Again unethical.


So you now agree that it is unethical to bar people from entering a country on the mere basis of race and religion? Pretty hard self-own there buddy.

&gt; You're losing steam. I can feel it. I can feel you trying your best to face reality, the hurtful truth. Yesss.. come to the right side, brother.

Personally I would like to see the press changed, I would like to have some kind of emphasis on reporting in context, with statistics that is. So that if there's a statistic used they should cite the study, the sample size and the test statistic. They should also provide context of similar studies in similar areas so that people understand how the problem really looks.

3836,"&gt;Just because everyone had collaborationists, doesn't mean it's fine.

Fine for whom? Are you really blaming the majority for the deeds of the minority? That minority of people were under no supervision of Estonia - it was an occupied state and by no means is the state or its people responsible for the actions of these collaborators. Nobody denies their existence, but for some reason especially Serbian users constantly make it look like they were a large part of the population and that was something unique to occupied European nations. Why is that?

&gt;Our collaborators for instance didn't commit crimes against Jews, they only arrested them, which is again, disgusting but nowhere on the same level.

And how do you even know what crimes against Jews did Estonian collaborators commit? Your collaborators helped fulfill the Holocaust just as well. They were under the orders of the occupying regime - do you really think they had the chance to pick which orders they will fulfill? It just seems so darn naive...

&gt;And we fought the Germans as well

So did Estonians. But to a noticeably smaller scale. But here again you need to understand that we had just been through perhaps the worst year in our nation's history. Nobody looked fondly on the Nazis - but guess what, the Soviet occupation here was so bad that people were willing to rather support the tyrannical occupying regime of a nation that had been the historical enemy for centuries...

And you just cannot forget that our SS-divisions were different from other SS-divisions. This is not some ""Nazi Baltic POV"" as you would so easily claim - this is [a historical fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Waffen_Grenadier_Division_of_the_SS_\(1st_Estonian\)#Aftermath) officially stated by the Allied High Commission. They were even used as guards during the Nuremberg Trials...

&gt;I didn't, just because it was occupied, doesn't mean the Germans did everything.

Neither did they in Serbia as you brought up yourself. Does that mean that Serbia is guilty of committing the Holocaust? Why are you so persistent on blaming us of Holocaust if pretty much every occupied European country was in the same situation?

&gt;My position is your logic is dumb

My logic is not dumb, but based on facts.

And now I have to intervene.

First of all, the argument was that without USSR people wouldn't have needed saving in the first place, so that includes all countries they invaded. France was just an example of a situation in '40.

But history doesn't start in '40.
Here, have a quite nice article

https://warontherocks.com/2016/06/sowing-the-wind-the-first-soviet-german-military-pact-and-the-origins-of-world-war-ii/

tl;dr

Germans and Russians started cooperation already in '20s. Together they were working on new technology, and German soldiers were training in Russia. The equipment was also produced in Russia, up to '33, when they discovered that allies don't care about Germans not respecting Treaty of Versailles, so they no longer had to hide arnament program.

So it doesn't come to just oil in '40, Germany without help of Russia would have more backwards (especially with airforce), with worse and fewer equipment, smaller and less trained army. On top of that - massive problems with resources.

And now they have to invade Poland withour USSR. In reality they faced less than 500k Polish soldiers, but in the worst case scenario they would have to face up to 2.2million (possibilities of Polish army in '39) - if German army moved slower, Poles would have more time to mobilize, and the soldiers normally caught by Russians, were already ready to fight.

But even with scenario that actually happened, Germans lost 25% of their airforce, and up to 1/3 of their tanks in invasion of Poland. With smaller to begin with forces, Germany would only suffer more % of equipment casualties, and additional casualties because of all reasons mentioned earlier.

And let's say Germany still wins, army strongly weakned by lack of Soviet supplies and training to begin with, is even more weakaned by even more strong Polish ressiliance, with less ressources to fix that lost equipment. 

And now they have to face France. But yeah, it's just some oil, lmao.

4022,"The east tends to have more old buildings.
After the war there was a huge craze about the modern, car friendly city for which entire neighborhoods were razed, even if they had not been damaged by the war.

The east simply didn't have enough money to do it on the same scale as the west, instead they focusted on single prestigious projects like Alexanderplatz or Frankfurter Allee. So you still have dense neighborhoods like Prenzlauer Berg and Friedrichshain.

The Western part was much more affected by 'Urban Renewal' programs. West Berlin was an island inside Eastern Germany, industry quickly fled the thread of communism and although being heavily subsidised the population was in decline. Districts next to the border were remodelled in a modern, suburban style at reduced density. In Wedding, Brunnenviertel was completely demolished and replaced by new development at half the previous density.

In Kreuzberg there were plans to build a motorway and also remodel the district in a 'modern' way - and while many houses were destroyed, squatters managed to save many buildings and eventually protests brought those plans to a halt in the 80ies.

The east on the other hand simply neglected the old buildings, they remained in their pre-war state and were mostly left to rot. Instead, not being constrained in area, new districts were erected on the green field.
After the wall came down those buildings have been renovated and are now highly desirable. ",Germany,/r/europe/comments/acrshf/berlin_1910_vs_2018/edbox9e/,ouyawei,1546719407

We lived under totalitarian occupation for 50 years. While your parents were enjoying a blow job in a drive in, mine were hiding their true love for Latvia so that their family would not be punished. While your parents enjoyed economic prosperity, our economies were sapped of resources to feed the Soviet Union.

I understand it is tiresome to see people from the Baltics talk about the Nazis as a lesser evil - I understand that, but there is a reason for that, and that reason is not Nazi apologism. It's a different EXPERIENCE, no matter what the end goals were. Our grandmother's did not experience the end goal, they experienced the difference between Nazi and Soviet occupations. And, unless you were a Latvian Jew, your experience felt - as in a totalitarian propaganda society - better under the Nazis. And, again, do not get me wrong - what happened to our Jewish minority sickens me and it reduces me to tears to read what my countrymen did and what happened to the Latvian Jews, but it does not mean we can ignore the cultural and ethnic cleansing that happened and that people like you are forcing us to accept as due payment for liberation.

The first one is about 30 years old. 'What is this old whore looking for around here?' – one of the three soldiers laughs. 'Bread, sir' – asks the woman. ... 'A kick in the ass you get, not bread' – answers the soldier. Owner of the flashlight directs the light again on the faces and bodies of girls. ... The youngest is maybe 15 years old ... They open her coat and start groping her with their lustfull paws.

Universities will be less relevant internationally as the world class researchers are simply applying to other countries.

Business will simply locate their manufacturing plants in Europe instead due to the uncertainty being not worth it.

The NHS has 100000 positions to fill which is growing by the day due to the heavy reliance on international staff.

Brexit will be a disaster for a few decades and rob a generation of their future.

implying christianity and islam is equally ""bad"" or belonging in europe.

&gt;And I'm more worried about the alt-right racists of Vlaams Belang than some communal seats for some local islam party 

Can't comment on that unfortunately, i'll read up on them more. Thx 


&gt;(note: islam, not islamist).

While the term islamist is a bit debated, it's generally about the political aspects of islam being enacted. How the hell is a political party that want to enact sharia not ""islamist""?

&gt;In case you are wondering: 3.8% of the EU population is muslim, so yes, they are entitled to representation. 

They have the right to vote, and yes many of them will probably vote for islamic policies, and for more muslims to enter. What i'm trying to say is that native europeans are doing a terrible mistake for themselves and for the future generations.

But aren't they just like us? Just adding x amount of human units to your neighborhood? Or are you saying they would behave in a tribalistic fashion if there's too many of them? Would they start to advocate for their collective interests against us in that case? 

&gt;Theres probably people more well versed in economy that could give you a decent estimate of how much people we actually need. 

This sounds bloody difficult, why should we go ahead with this if it has catastrophic results if we add just a few too many of these immigrants?

&gt;Why do they have to ""behave like us"" ? Im totally fine with them just knowing the local language and adopting the general rules of society. If they want to keep some of their ethnic identity, i dont think theres a problem with that.

So that nothing changes for the worse and everything continues as it was, just with a few more people. For example, absolutely no increase in crime per capita, among other things. We have to live here too, you know.

And companies must have a fixed salary for jobs except special kind of jobs, you can't tell your employee ""I will pay you whatever I feel like every months"". Extra month(s) allows the company to keep following the rules to protect the employee, while also managing its expense in a way that doesn't limit its ability to invest and grow.

Let's say your salary is 12000€ a year, so 1000€ a month.

Now you probably want to ask ""so its worse for the employee at the benefit of the company ?"" but the point is not to make existing employee go to that, it's to allow company to do that so they make hire that they wouldn't have done otherwise, which appears to have some positive effect in terms of employment in affected industries.",France,/r/europe/comments/acig0x/unemployed_in_spain_declined_by_6_in_2018/edamx5q/,nolok,1546690528

WRONG: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Great\_Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Illusion)  


&gt;In *The Great Illusion*, Angell's primary thesis was, in the words of historian [James Joll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joll),  that ""the economic cost of war was so great that no one could possibly  hope to gain by starting a war the consequences of which would be so  disastrous.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Illusion#cite_note-3) For that reason, a general European war was very unlikely to start, and if it did, it would not last long.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Illusion#cite_note-keegan-4) He argued that war was economically and socially irrational[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Illusion#cite_note-pity-5)  and that war between industrial countries was futile because conquest  did not pay. J. D. B. Miller writes: ""The 'Great Illusion' was that  nations gained by armed confrontation, militarism, war, or conquest.""[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Illusion#cite_note-miller1985-6)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Monnet

&gt;Jean Monnet has been called ""The Father of Europe"" by those who see his innovative and pioneering efforts in the 1950s as the key to establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, the predecessor of today’s European Union.

-

&gt; Soon after his arrival in Washington, D.C., he became an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

-

&gt; In 1955, Monnet founded the Action Committee for the United States of Europe in order to revive European construction following the failure of the European Defence Community (EDC). It brought political parties and European trade unions together to become a driving force behind the initiatives which laid the foundation for the European Union as it eventually emerged: first the European Economic Community (EEC) (1958) (known commonly as the ""Common Market""), which was established by the Treaty of Rome of 1957; later the European Community (1967) with its corresponding bodies, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers, British membership in the Community (1973), the European Council (1974), the European Monetary System (1979), and the European Parliament (1979). This process reflected Monnet's belief in a gradualist approach for constructing European unity.
&gt;
&gt;On 6 December 1963, Monnet was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Special Distinction, by United States President Lyndon Johnson. In 1972, Queen Elizabeth II made him an honorary Companion of Honour. 

https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/aldrich/publications/oss_cia_united_europe_eec_eu.pdf

&gt;One of the most interesting US covert operations in postwar Europe was the funding of the European Movement. The European Movement was an umbrella organization which led a prestigious, if disparate, group of organizations urging rapid unification in Europe, focusing their efforts upon the Council of Europe, and counting Winston Churchill, Paul-Henri Spaak, Konrad Adenauer, Leon Blum and Alcide de Gasperi as its five Presidents of Honour. In 1948, its main handicap was the scarcity of funds. It will be argued here that the discreet injection of over three million dollars between 1949 and 1960, mostly from US government sources, was central to efforts to drum up mass support for the Schuman Plan, the European Defence
Community and a European Assembly with sovereign powers. This
covert contribution never formed less than half the European
Movement's budget and, after 1952, probably two-thirds. Simultaneously
they sought to undermine the staunch resistance of the British Labour
government to federalist ideas.

 This is not taxonomy.

Even among those fighting for Nazi Germany in WW2, how many of those wpuld have ancestors coming from neighbouring places in tge previous 3 to 4 generations of thei family tree? How many of those wouldnt even know the whole of the doctrine of their party?

and just so you know, flairs arent shown in full length

Now, I'm not saying that you approve of it or that you think that it was reasonable of course.

Also, the game testers I know do a lot more than just playing the game but rather have to write unit tests, tools to automate playing the games in order to try and find bugs before documenting precise reproduction steps for the devs to fix.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**If the word neo nazi ,where we recognize the guys identity choice and political inspiration while ackowledging differences with the original deal, doesnt suit you, then what does?**

What differences?

&gt;**Also, you need to stop calling the word neo nazi/nazi and xenophobic propaganda, nobody is arguing that every single member of the right is any of the above, as you seem te believe to some degree, and the definitions provided are very good fits.**

I'll call it propaganda, because you just proved it. ""Rights"". Nazism stands for national socialism. Socialism. Right tend to be more free-market oriented. Nazism has much more in common with modern left-leaning people. Killing jews, other ethnicities was not that big part of their ideology.  
Socialists ideas of healthcare, public insurance, public education, public roads, nationalized industry, etc. was more prominent element of their ideology. It's just killing people is much more a moral and ""scandalous"" so people without knowledge of nazism tend to consider them to be right.  
Propaganda.  
Same with xenophobia. There is no clear definition and typically it means something different than the original meaning of that word was.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Would you call Hitler a non nazi because he migjt have had some degree of Jewish heritage? Who would you deem a member of the German nation?

He also might have been immortal God that won 2nd World War. I'll not dwell into ""mights"" without definition of neo-nazism. You seemed to assume that neo-nazism does not have to have specific definition itself and any difference can do. Nope.

&gt;In contrast, the UK operates a surplus in its services trade with the EU, meaning that the UK sells more than it buys. Total services exports to the EU were worth £81.3bn in 2014 while imports were worth £64.2bn, leaving a trade surplus of just over £17bn. Germany (£12.1bn), France (£11.7bn) and the Netherlands (£11bn) are the primary markets for UK services exports.

4688,"&gt; ""allah"" is the arabic for world for God.

Not really. First of all it is spelled with a capital A, because it is a proper name. Its etymology is not entirely clear, but it is generally considered to be derived by the fusion of the article *al* (the) with the word *ilah* (divinity) to obtain something ""Thedivinity"".

&gt;  it's the abrahamic god the same supposed god for christians / jews.

That is a claim that Muslims make. Like all ontological claims about deities, it is unprovable and ultimately meaningless. What matters is that this imaginary friend of theirs demands human sacrifice, and had a pedophile rapist warlord murderer slaver for a prophet. 

Also notice how the Freedom Index is claimed to be based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is considered to be incompatible with Islam by the Muslims themselves, who consider the death penalty for blasphemy to be a totally humane thing to do. You can read more about this here:

For two, he was the driving force behind the philosophy of absurdism which purports that humans naturally search for meaning in life but cannot find any in a godless, chaotic, irrational universe. The existence of such a universe and the humans simultaneously creates a conflict which he dubbed the absurd.

4741,"&gt;How does this source show Greek being ""primary"" in any way?

It seems you don't even know how a stacked area chart is read! Let me help you out, your own source shows that in 1920 the total population of the city was approximately 1.2 million and that Muslims numbered a little over 400k. I said that the Greeks were the plurality, not the majority.

&gt;The city is clearly called Istanbul. If using outdated names

Nobody cares what you call it or what you think is ""outdated"". I'll still also call the city of Bangalore as such (instead of Bengaluru), and hell... I'll even call entire countries like Persia or Burma instead of any ""official"" name. Guess what, everyone understands what I'm talking about (when used in English) and nobody cries about it unlike you.

&gt;Please tell me you are joking.

You honestly don't know that Constantinople was not ""not under Turkish administration"" (which is what I wrote) following WW1? I question what history they teach in your country.

&gt;changing the name of an ethnic group isn't really a genocide.

You changed peoples names, banned their language, imprisoned/disappeared/murdered countless thousands, demolished thousands of villages/towns, forcefully displaced millions, to name but a few of the crimes. Sounds like you're a genocide apologist.

&gt;There are way more treaties

None that apply to territorial changes between Greece and Turkey and name the protected minorities and where they live (which besides Constantinople includes Imbros and Tenedos). But nice try.

&gt;I'm talking about once Turkey actually became a country. The Kurds in Istanbul aren't new in 2019.

Not new in 2019, but now simply number over 3 million which is again a new high (only to be beaten by the following year). The HDP got almost 13% in the last elections in the greater Constantinople region (which is a minimum percent as many Kurds vote AKP, just like many yobaz).

&gt;It says ""Greece opposes the use of the name ""Macedonia"" by the Republic of Macedonia"".

[FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945v08/d258)

*The Department has noted with considerable apprehension increasing propaganda rumors and semi-official statements in favor of an autonomous Macedonia, emanating principally from Bulgaria, but also from Yugoslav Partisan and other sources, with the implication that Greek territory would be included in the projected state. This Government considers talk of Macedonian “nation,” Macedonian “Fatherland,” or Macedonian “national consciousness” to be unjustified demagoguery representing no ethnic nor political reality, and sees in its present revival a possible cloak for aggressive intentions against Greece.*

Most surviving Schlösser are in much better condition than Burgen because the military aspect became moot with advancing military technology, leading to the abandonment of Burg type buildings in modern history in favour of pomposity. The first Schlösser came up in the 15th century; medieval Burgen have been around since before 600 BC.


There is also the *Pfalz*, which is a resident Burg and served to accommodate the ruler of the HRE during his many travels through the empire.

So explain to me how a moderate sees a few left wing people being destructive, whereas the party is not, then decides to turn to a party like Golden Dawn, which is filled with destructive, violent individuals, including ordinary members and party officials.  


There is no fucking logic in being disgusted with ""left wing chaos"", and turning to a party that literally carries out indiscriminate attacks on people they deem inferior.  


&gt;About the government involvement, there were multiple situations were police involvement was minimal or none. 

I provided an example on how that is bullshit and you have yet to cite a single incident.

No, you know a ton of already right wing people going further right because they are disillusioned. Centrists and leftists do not turn to a Hitler saluting Neo-Nazi party.  


&gt;Then you keep up bringing up stuff that the nazis did when i never said they were any better...

I know it escapes those that still pretend to ignore that Istanbul is a corruption of the Greek ""Stin Poli"".

Let me know if you have a hard time understanding from the Greek name which ""Turkish"" cities I'm referring to. Butchering the pronunciation of these Greeks names and being butthurt about people calling them properly is a reflection of your insecurities.

&gt;I too will use old and outdated city name

And nobody would care. Mind you, these ""old and outdated"" names existed for 1600-2500 years and were ""changed"" (butchered Turkish pronunciation) less than 100 years ago.

&gt;In a few years of occupation you would consider Istanbul to be a French city?

No, it still had it's still character and was administered by the victors of WW1. Point is, it was not under Turkish administration. Just so you can know how ignorant the ""since 1453"" claim is.

&gt;Primarily Greek? Really?

You should look at your own source before embarrassing yourself. The Greeks held the plurality of the population prior to 1923. The Muslims were a small minority. Your own source says so, so I won't bother presenting something more credible than Wikipedia.

\&gt;uses a youtube video as a source

\&gt;talks about intelligence

&gt;a small part of a massive propaganda campaign, attempting to deny Kurdish existence.

A massive campaign at genocide you mean to say, because that's what an attempt to eradicate an ethnicity is called (even if it failed). In contrast, nobody denies the existence of ""Stin Poli"" regardless of what you wish to call it. You should also know that there is no such thing as an ""internationally recognized"" city name. In fact, the internationally binding treaties between Greece and Turkey (like the [Treaty of Lausanne](https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne)) which was written in English in 1923, refers to the city as Constantinople. 

&gt;Turkey has always had millions of Kurds, Istanbul included.

Constantinople did not have a Kurdish population of any significance prior to 1923. Today the city is again being transformed into having a Turkish minority. In the place of the Greek and Armenian victims of genocide you now have Kurds, Arabs, and Central Asiatics (among others).

&gt;I won't cease to remember that the millions of Arabs who are going to Turkey from northern Arabia are one of the same people who had a devastating revolt against the Ottoman Empire at the exact same time the Ottomans were fighting the British and French.

Well, with an ever increasing Kurdish and Arab population, we may yet see another new name added to that of glorious Constantinople. I just hope the new name is as equally Greek as ""Stin Poli""/Istanbul.

They see the chaos in universities, places like exarcheia along with other incidents and go with literally the only party that vows to stop those things. Especially since the incidents caused by Golden Dawn mostly dont affect the average greek (not saying they arent important tho)

""I provided an example on how that is bullshit and you have yet to cite a single incident. ""

I mean you can provide as many examples as you want, some cases of police involvement doesnt mean there are no other situations where police involvement is minimal. Especially in the Universities where are I am personally involved including members of my family working there and where literally told that the police won't crack down on incidents fearing that the incidents will simply get worse and more extreme as a response. 


&gt;Agreeing with the low-lives on /r/The_Donald on various topics, roleplaying as a fascist, saying Greece needs to ""crack down"" on leftists, and white-washing the fascist past of post-WW2 Greece, the Junta, and the following incompetence of Neo-conservative parties in Greece as ""healthy"" makes you undeniably a right wing sympathiser. You're not a moderate, you're pretending to be one, but it's fairly obvious to anyone who knows anything about Greece that you're twisting the truth. You're a disgrace to Greeks everywhere

This is the best part of your post tbh wow.
I dont see how agreeing with some positions of the conservative party in the Unites States makes me an extremist. All I see is a butthurt person who refuses to accept that there are people with opposite points of views and insults them by calling them low lifes.

Comservative parties in Greece ARE healthy. Ive never seen anyone on the right nor on the left in Greece claim otherwise lol. Are they usually as corrupt and inefficient as the left wing ones? Probably but that doesnt make them extreme.

""Whitewashhing fascism""

Simply Wow. I never supported anything they did and if you think that going full totalitarian mode against them is the answer (ironic... that was THEIR answer to everything) and that this will actually make people vote for good parties instead of making more people vote for them you are completely delusional.

""Roleplaying as a fascist""

PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD post the exact roleplay i did as a fascist nation so everyone here can laugh at you for calling me a fascist for playing ww2 games and picking many countries including the fascist ones. I guess you also support banning games that lets you play as any side you disagree with?

As your flair says Australian I would say that first of all I AM GLAD that you arent Greek as I donr need to feel ashamed for my people  for ehat you sre saying (Sorry Australia), thanks for insulting me, but Greeks are the last people on Earth who would consider me a disgrace because i disagree with your totalitarian and fascist like approaches to combat nazism and extremism.

Please keep your policies and extreme views in your country and let us deal with our problems. Also i hope you got some games for christmas so you can realize that playing as someone you would disagree with as real life doesnt make you them (omg i like criminals because i also play Gta  i didnt think of that before)

It was great seeing the true face of some people like you but I think this conversation is over as you keep shouting the same fascist crap over and over again but ""they are fine"" because they are directed to the right.

This growth is not based on something real, just on a tax differential from a large neighbouring industrial powerhouse, and has debatable pluses for the population since it's accompanied by disadvantages but doesn't bring advantages in terms of wage growth or availability of good jobs. They brought increased tax base, plus traffic jams and wage dumping. 

I don't see it as a sustainable development model either, one of the largest fashion companies already closed business again throwing chaos in municipal finances, so everything is kinda subject to the whims of multinationals.

5317,"I have seen this happening since the 1980s when Europe started to lose electronic components, memory chip productions as well as consumer electronics and office automation equipment to Asia. It continued with other mass products such as solar panels, smart phones, etc. We are going to see the same with e-cars and batteries. While retooling for each new generation of these mass products requires huge investments, profit margins are slim due to intense competition. That's why profit-oriented Western companies cannot compete with Asian conglomerates which prioritize conquering market share over profit-maximization.

Germany did make a comeback after it was considered the ""sick man of Europe in the 1990s. So, all is not lost, and the intention behind this article in the Handelsblatt (like numerous other statements we have seen from politics and industry during the last few years) is to alert the public to the danger. 

Europe has a very high standard of living. It's not possible to maintain that standard of living by low-wage mass production. Thus, in view of the intense competition and huge investments, Europe has to focus on innovative products, on robotics and customized machines instead of on cheap mass products.

Asians have learned from the West and used industrial policy to promote domestic industry and catch up with the West. It's time for Europe to learn from Asia how to use industrial policy to promote European industry. The free market is good, but the doctrine of the free market which prevents nations from developing domestic industries is not good. We have to combine the free market with an industrial policy that will allow us to subsidize fledgling industries.

5434,"&gt;That probably plays a factor as well, but I still think money is the biggest factor. For example in Sweden there was no Holocaust and the amount of Jews living in Sweden is not significant, but it is among the wealthiest countries in Europe which allows a significant number of people to travel abroad and visit Auschwitz.

Perhaps. 42000 isn't that much though. 

As for the amount of Jews living in Sweden, we don't know it.  But a lot of jews did escape there. 

&gt;In the years after World War II, many Jewish refugees from the Baltic Countries, Romania and Poland moved to Sweden. Following the war, the Jewish population of Stockholm alone was 7,000 including children.[6] For example, the cartoonist Art Spiegelman was born in Stockholm, where his father Vladek Spiegelman had moved after surviving a concentration camp. In the following decades, more waves of Jewish refugees came from Hungary in 1956 and 1968 who had fled the Communist government. More refugees came then from Poland between 1968-1970. Between 1945 and 1970, the Jewish population of Sweden doubled.

Right now it's estimated at about 20000

&gt;There is no ethnic registration in Sweden, so the Jewish population can only be roughly estimated. The Official Council of Swedish Jewish Communities estimation is that about 20,000 pass the halakhic criteria.

But with a rather strict criteria to be jewish.

Some housekeeping notes:

1. For non-EU countries, only 2016 data is available, so I used that. I believe 2017 data will be available, but only at a later date simply because their countries statistical agencies are not as tightly integrated into Eurostat.

2. I chose the PPS (Eurostat's version of PPP) database because it better reflect living costs. The income brackets are arbitrary and my own.

5625,"&gt;It's not special treatment (if that is actually the rate) if any company can do it. Can you point to the law Apple were told they didn't have to follow? Or to a tax rate that only applies to Apple?

That is the rate and not everyone can do it, it was a secret agreement between Apple and the Irish tax authorities.

According to the Commission, the tax arrangement between Ireland and Apple qualifies as state aid as it meets the European Union's four criteria:[48]

-There has been an intervention by the State

-This intervention gives the benefactor a competitive advantage on a selective basis

-As a result, competition has been or may be distorted

-The intervention is likely to affect trade between the Member States

&gt;Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.

&gt;You never did answer my question as to what the right minimum rate was?

Yet more intellectual dishonesty as this isn't the point. The 12.5% rate is legal. What isn't are the secret and bespoke arrangements of the Irish authorities. No one cares if the chippy down the corner pays 10% or so on its profits.

&gt;Some do and others dont

Which ones do not?

Guess what, this happens in a socialist country as well, only that the group that does the filtering are the rich in a capitalist country (20% or less), whereas in a socialist country the filtering is done by the middle class (that artificial equality), which is a very big group closer to 60-80% of the population. So the upper class limiting your options to succeed is bad, but the middle class limiting them is good? Why, because you're middle class so you're already in so it feel fair? The truly poor are fucked in both scenarios, because welfare is always targeted at stereotypical situations and the poor are never stereotypical. The only truly ""caring"" form of welfare is UBI, because it imposes no restrictions, but I have seen no intention of making that a true reality anywhere. The type of welfare that is targeted at ""families with 3 children and 2 dogs living in a 55.5 sqm apartment on the second floor, in between 34 and 44 year old etc"", that's not real welfare, that's a way to condition your behavior so you do what rest of society and government wants you to do (have 3 children and 2 dogs and buy a 55.5 sqm apartment etc).

5630,"Real wages have not been growing with economic growth expected since the financial crisis. This is pretty basic stuff and has been happening in most countries. It is probably because of cheap labor coming in the countries, flexible contracts, more mini jobs instead of full employment, fear of people from asking more money.

&gt;This is utter nonsense. 

Banks have nothing to do with minimum wages. Are we seriously looking at China to compare wealth growth? Totally different starting points, situations and work environments. This is not proof of anything. US startups do not do well because of low minimum wages. Availability of private equity has nothing to do with minimum wage. You are now just throwing unrelated stuff around.

&gt;And again that does not mean that increasing minimum wages would be a good idea.

Your argument is companies will move away because of higher wages. Yet they already pay most of their people more. So your argument falls flat.

&gt;No I am advocating for the exact opposite. Those whom lack the basic skills which every German has would be able to find employment, make up that skill deficit, and eventually be on par and be able to compete with your regular Germans. The policy which you are advocating for would ensuring the creation of a class of unemployable individuals who have no way to make money, build skills, and build a life for themselves. A permanent welfare class.

If they lack basic skills to work, then that is the problem. Not the pay they receive.

It's a figure of speech, I don't literally mean that Ireland has been acting as subservient to the UK at all. They have and the others have been natural allies and have used the combined voting and economical influence of a UK-led alliance to support a liberal free-market which relates to tax unanimity and the main article in question.

He painted a number of works on the subject such as The Expulsion of the Turkish Ship, and The Armenian Massacres at Trebizond. He threw the medals given to him by the Ottoman Sultan into the sea and told the Turkish consul in Feodosia: ""Tell your bloodthirsty master that I've thrown away all the medals given to me, here are their ribbons, send it to him and if he wants, he can throw them into the seas painted by me.""[34] He created several painting on the events, such as The Massacre of Armenians in Trebizond (1895), Lonely Ship, Night.

Ireland is the *only*  country which actually used the last bailout after the financial crisis  to do something in the way of structural reforms instead of wasting it  on consumption. And after some painful readjustments, they dug out of  the crisis and resurged.

Because they do enormous damage to, among others, the German Tax payer to aiding, abetting and profiting from tax theft in the dozen of billions every year?

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Why shouldn't we give them a hands-up again?

Who is we? If this is suppossed to be Germany, well let me count the ways, we have one of the highest tax loads and one of the lowest personal wealths on the continet, a considerable level of poverty as many low skill jobs disappeared to Eastern Europe and China. 

We take care of millions of economically useless refugees once our good friends in the US and France are done with bombing, burning and murdering. 

The East screams like a whiny baby every time we so much as talk to Russia, while digging ever deeper into our pockets and we still finance half of the Mediterrenian. 

Why shouldn't we throw out some more tax money for every parasite within 10 000 kilometers instead of taking care of our own poor?

Tell you what if you feel the need to be solidaric take your net income and lend out as much as you want to Ireland or whoever the fuck. 

I'm paying 42% of tax and social security contributions and that's ok. What's not ok is the level of poverty und fucked up infrastructure I'm getting for this.

Buddy, you know jack shit about history and very little about how the world viewed your own region's most recent little kerfuffle. 

There were far too many people in the Western world who thought the UN &amp; co. should just allow the various ethnic groups in the Balkans to exterminate one another because ""it's their culture, they've be fighting each other for centuries"". 

But in to Turkey. Turkey hasn't ruled the area for a century and the Balkams didn't fight a decades long war of independence against the Turks. Yet somehow Turkey still remains geographically next door and economically a major trading partner with the region. Should Turkey be blamed for the corruption which is endemic in the Balkan governments? Probably not. Is Turkey still exerting a significant influence? Yes. Russia too. But the Balkans are also being given significant support from the EU towards maintaining their sovereignty and improving the quality of living of their citizens.

Now compare this to Africa, where the last colonies only gained their independence after bloody wars of liberation in the '70s, so two generations after the Balkans did. They also experienced bloody civil wars, as did the Balkans, but with minimal Western intervention. While there were less than 15K death in Kosovo in 1999, largely due to NATO involvement, 500K+ died in Rwanda in the same time period.

And now African nation are beseiged by Western corporations, and recently Chinese ones too, with complete disregard for their political stability.

5883,"Thanks foe the long response. I didn’t know about their debt, you are right, that seems to be a problem. I need to read more about that. I do have some disagreements still though.

1) You mention China being guilty of stealing western research. Research cannot really be stolen, it so done for the good of humanity, and anyone can access if is they pay the publishing fees, which is no problem for a country (typically 20-30 dollars per paper or a few thousand for access to an entire journal). I think you are confusing it with IP which can be stolen, and does allow Chinese industry an unfair advantage.

2) You mention that percent change is a poor measure of scientific advancement because it it only a measure of its own size. First, I think this is a fine metric. For one Pakistan as you mention has the highest percent increase. You cannot compare 2 countries like Pakistan and China because the absolute number of papers accepted is so different. Pakistan’s is low enough that the percent change suffers from shot noise, where as China is well near the shot noise limit. This means that a 13.3% increase is statically more significant than that of Pakistan. 
Second, yes per capita the US produces more research than China by a large margin. I’m not sure what point you are trying to make because I am only saying that they are rapidly increasing their scientific output, which i still know to be true.

3) You’re point on renewable energy is completely wrong. China has been the world leader in wind, hydro and solar output for over a decade, and is ahead of the next country (the US) by a massive margin. Currently renewables are providing around 26% of their energy which is comparable to that of Germany.

You have a good point on some statistics being reported. However the research ones are accurate because they are not reported by China but by indecent publishers around the world. And even if renewables is exaggerated, there is no way it can be off by that much to may my argument invalid since it is easily verifiable by satellite images.

Everything you said about the dictatorship and cost in human suffering is correct obviously. It’s just how much you are willing to trade in rights and democracy for efficiency and progress in some areas.

5971,"Oh, but you are. Everyone who knows recent Italian history can issue corrections to your statements.

A good example: Over the last twenty years Italy has not been run by the PD. They've been largely divided between the centre right (Forza Italia/PDL), extreme-right (Lega) and PD. Any assertion to the contrary is a falsification. Responsibility has been fully shared.

For Salvini supporters, its a common rhetorical trope to argue that until now, Italy was run by the centre-left. It papers over the ruin caused by successive Berlusconi-Lega governments until 8 years ago, which destroyed the economy, as they used their time in government to rob the coffers and screw up the adoption of the euro.

The PD failed to adequately fix that era's economic mess, and austerity was a big part of its failings. That's what happened.
