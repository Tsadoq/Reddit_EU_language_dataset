13,"Its dodgy the way they report the daily deaths (only the people who died the day before and is already notified by the next day), but i dont think what this person is claiming is the truth. The retroactively reported deaths are added to the total (on the day that they happened, instead of on the day that they were reported, like other countries do).
If you dont believe me just look at the last 2 reports:

This one for day 23:
https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_169_COVID-19.pdf

This one for day 24: https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_170_COVID-19.pdf

Now go to page 8 of the report, that its where the daily deaths are reported. You will see that on day 23 report there is 0 deaths reported on day 14. But on the next day there is 1 death reported that day. 

Plus in the page 2 of the report you will see a link in the footnote to an excel. The excel has all reported deaths by day and by autonomous comunity since february. The excel is also updated regularly. So the claim that the deaths are not retroactively added to the totals its just false. They are added, just with a really big delay, say in a month from now we will have mostly acurate data of the number of deaths today.

For example day 8 of june it was reported in the press that it was the first day with 0 deaths (https://www.elmundo.es/ciencia-y-salud/2020/04/07/5e8ccdaefdddfff8b18b46be.html), but if you go to the excel now and take a look at the day 8 of june you will see that there were 18 deaths that day.

I think maybe this person doesnt understand spanish enough to look for this data, since for some reason its kinda hidden in the reports and not very obvious, and its such a weird way to report the deaths.",,/r/europe/comments/hxrr24/uk_brings_back_14day_quarantine_for_spain/fzahl6m/,blueoceanwaves3,1595760711

24,"A well put analysis.

As a person from Istanbul, I have some additions to make;

I am totally against Hagia Sophia being converted to a fucking mosque, especially while there are 93459987453984 more mosques around it. It's a magnificent artifact from 1500 years ago. I find it outrageous that people still fight over it whether it belongs to christian or muslim world. It fucking belongs to people from all over the world for them to see and learn.

It is a move done by Erdogan, solely to push trashy islamism and nationalism in domestic politics, trying to consolidate all ignorant and islamist people while his approval rates are on freefall.

However, as far as I can see from here, EU nations are playing erdogan's ""not yours, ours"" game. They are pushing Erdogan to take a more islamist stance. I can tell you guys that, people will go to Hagia Sophia to pray (they already could while it was a museum) for like 2-3 months, then they will start to forget. It will work in like 5% capacity at tops. It is the destiny of all symbolic mosques or religious places that are artificially pushed to the turkish culture by AKP. It will not possess that much of an importance.

To sum up, they've just changed its official name and purpose, number of people praying in it will fall gradually and we all can still enjoy it. A plus side is, since it's a mosque now, it's free now. I wouldn't be surprised if AKP found a way to fuck it up more or charge people, especially tourists. But for now, it seems like a minor domestic political move and it will be forgotten in a few months. It will eventually be converted back to museum, as it generated some fair amount of income.",,/r/europe/comments/hy2aml/hagia_sophia_erdogans_last_desperate_trick_as_an/fzaho0r/,naughtybitch07,1595760794

27,"&gt;I wouldn't know now about where or when they publicly disclosed about contacting Admins, I believe I read about this from their mods replying to comments in threads at the time, prior or after.

*Precisely*. Why would you? You are in no obligation to dig through the comments made 8 months+ ago, that would take ages unless you remember exactly where that statement was. It should have been specified in the policy thread itself so that it is easier to look for.

&gt;That statement about monitoring I read to be about monitoring content posted about Turkey on the sub because this is the content which invited brigading, and further action I assume to mean to prohibit content related to Turkey partially or totally, although I have no idea if this is the case or how it would work - but that is a reasonable interpretation of all that.

Alright, that might be it. I can agree with you there.

&gt;As for evidence, again, evidence was there for all to see, there is no need for the mods at the time to explicitly show this when these acts were disrupting the sub continuously, the sub itself was an evidence, it would crawl to its knees because of the brigading.

Not this, though.

&gt;As I said earlier, just look at the comment section of the thread with the europe mod statement to see a clear example of mass vote manipulation. 

And certainly not *this*. What does this even mean? Just because Turkish redditors complaining about the policy, stating that it reeks of racism are upvoted, does that mean vote manipulation? No! It means that even r/Europe users agree that it was a silly decision to make, that achieved absolutely *nothing*. Seriously! Do not state your opinion as facts! Turkish redditors *can* get upvoted, it's normal! Sometimes, they *are* right! The burden of proof is on *you* about claims regarding mass vote manipulation!

58,"You're not wrong that there are many factors which twist our impression. This is why I said based on statues and coinage, because coins were a form of propaganda and should be considered as such. 

However, I'll argue some of your points. Julio-Claudian portraits were very distinct, especially on coinage. Tiberius' portraits got older as he aged. Nero's portraits got fatter as he got fatter. Augustus' portraits were commonly idealized as a beautiful young man and differ in that from the others. Even his coinage evolved and we see an evolution in portraits from when he was named Octavian to when he first ascended and towards the end of his life.

I'll also argue that some of the sameyness of the Antonines comes from the beard and hairstyle while some probably comes from the artisans being used to depicting the bearded curly haired rulers in a specific style. Perhaps there is a motivation that consistent portraits provide stability, but I honestly don't see much imitation between the Antonines other than a lent hairstyle and beard. Even Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius can be easily differentiated on portraits alone. Commodus is the one exception whose depictions occasionally seem to imitate those of his father.

&gt;but there was also a lot of staging done to underline the legitimacy of the new emperors and to put them in line with their predecessors.

This was commonly done by involving the heir on coinage from early on. For example, we have beardless youthful portraits of Marcus Aurelius as a caesar on coins.

1. His efforts to invade Syria came to an end after Russia killed many Turkish soldiers there.
2. He took a severe hit in Libya after ignoring the deal he signed to stop arming the native forces when Watiya base was bombed.
3. His efforts to expand Turkey's EEZs at the Mediterranean sea are highly unlikely that will have any meaningful result. Chances are that the research he has authorized will never take place and even if it does I don't think it will be really successful for Turkey. If Germany was holding a more responsible stance as France does he probably wouldn't even talk about any research in the area.

If you think the treaty is about being pro-LGBT then you haven't read it. This is fact.

Edit: Domestic violence is still a thing in Europe. *That* is why it exists.

&gt; National reports, studies and surveys revealed the magnitude of the problem in Europe. The campaign in particular showed a large variation in Europe of national responses to violence against women and domestic violence. Thus the need for harmonised legal standards to ensure that victims benefit from the same level of protection everywhere in Europe became apparent. The Ministers of Justice of Council of Europe member states began discussing the need to step up protection from domestic violence, in particular intimate partner violence.

Sounds sensible.

247,"There‚Äôs only one person who‚Äôll be genuinely pleased with the Intelligence and Security Committee‚Äôs Russia report, finally revealed on Tuesday, and that‚Äôs Vladimir Putin. Russia emerges as an amorphous and formidable enemy ‚Äî all the more so because the inconclusive and much-redacted report contains next to no substantiated allegations. Instead Russia appears as a phantom, unknowable menace, and this will spawn a thousand conspiracy theories far more corrosive and confusing to our politics than any Moscow-generated Twitter-storm or document leak.

There‚Äôs no smoking gun on Brexit. Yet the government-induced delay in publication allows anyone that way inclined to imagine a cover-up. Even the insistence that the state should do more to prevent Russian meddling plays into Putin‚Äôs hands. The fear of Russian interference in British elections creates chaos and division ‚Äî and this, rather than any particular result, is Putin‚Äôs real goal.

Russia may be reeling from a collapse in oil prices and one of the highest rates of Covid-19 infection in the world, but Moscow relies on pushing the idea that it‚Äôs the West that is really in trouble, racked with violent culture wars and suffering from a profound loss of faith in its own values. The Kremlin‚Äôs new party line is: we may have it bad, but their crisis is much worse. And where Putin‚Äôs propagandists lead, its trolls and hackers follow.

If recent history is anything to go by, the raging divisions around the Black Lives Matter movement are also a sweet spot for Russian trolls set on fanning the flames of the West‚Äôs self-immolation ‚Äî in the UK, in the EU and especially in America. A US Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the 2016 US presidential election concluded that a Russian fake-news campaign targeted ‚Äòno single group‚Ä¶ more than African-Americans‚Äô. Russian operatives used social media to suppress black voter turnout and stoke division along racial lines. One Facebook page that the group operated, Blacktivist, racked up 11.2 million user engagements and more than 360,000 likes by September 2017 ‚Äî compared with the 301,000 likes of the verified Black Lives Matter Facebook account.

Russian trolls are equal-opportunity provocateurs. Between 2014 and 2017 the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm based in St Petersburg funded by close Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin, ran thousands of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts propagating both pro-black and pro-Southern culture themes in the US ‚Äî as well as pro-Scottish independence and Brexit-related tweets and posts. A detailed 2018 study by the University of Washington found that Russian-controlled Twitter accounts that mentioned the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter were disseminating not only pro-BLM messages but also ironic anti-BLM memes such as ‚ÄòWhat is this world coming to when you can‚Äôt aim a gun at some cops without them shooting you? #BlackLivesMatter‚Äô. And just in case that wasn‚Äôt cynical enough, Russian trolls even sought to discredit BLM by promoting the message that ‚Äò#BlackLivesMatter is an arm of the Russian government‚Äô.

Is the Internet Research Agency still up to its old tricks during the latest season of violence and civil strife that has spread from America to the UK? Most certainly, according to seven US officials briefed on the latest intelligence who spoke recently to the New York Times, and warned that Russia‚Äôs SVR foreign intelligence agency has stepped up the scale and sophistication of its efforts to fuel discord. ‚ÄòWe see Russia is willing to conduct more brazen and disruptive influence operations because of how it perceives its conflict with the West,‚Äô David Porter, a top agent in the FBI‚Äôs Foreign Influence Task Force, told an election security conference in Washington in February. ‚ÄòTo put it simply‚Ä¶ Russia wants to watch us tear ourselves apart.‚Äô

While Facebook and Twitter have become more vigilant about fake accounts, the Russians have also become much better at covering their tracks. After technical details of how fake accounts were spotted emerged during the Congressional investigations, trolls now take care to remove traceable watermarks from their photographs and avoid overtly racist language that gets flagged up by automated systems. Rather than use public pages to spread messages as widely as possible, as in 2016, Russian operatives are ‚Äî according to the officials who briefed the New York Times ‚Äî using private Facebook groups, posts on the online message board 4chan and closed chat rooms that are more difficult to monitor. And in a sinister echo of the micro-polling strategies developed by Cambridge Analytica, these messages and groups are tightly targeted on swing voters in swing states.

The Kremlin‚Äôs new party line is: we may have it bad, but the West‚Äôs crisis is much worse
It‚Äôs no surprise that Russia is so good at influence operations in the West given how long it‚Äôs been doing them. In the 1920s and 1930s the brilliant Moscow-backed German Communist agitator and networker Willi M√ºnzenberg set up and channelled money to dozens of front organisations, from the League against Imperialism to Workers International Relief, in order to draw thousands of liberal-minded people into supporting good causes secretly funded by the Communist International. M√ºnzenberg called them his ‚Äòinnocents‚Äô clubs‚Äô. These arms-length organisations had much wider influence than overtly Soviet propaganda organs such L‚ÄôHumanit√© or the Daily Worker‚Äî just as today‚Äôs fake accounts have more influence than the conspiracy-theory spewing Sputnik news agency and the RT (formerly Russia Today) news channel, where it was recently claimed that BLM was a front organisation funded by George Soros.

In 1927, well before Europe had become the cultural suburb of the US that it is today, M√ºnzenberg‚Äôs network whipped up global protests against the execution of a pair of American anarchists, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, convicted for double murder during a robbery. Protests in support of Sacco and Vanzetti were held in every major city in North America and Europe, as well as in Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Johannesburg, Auckland and even by the pearl divers of Dubai. After the pair eventually went to the electric chair, just after midnight on 23 August 1927, angry rioters destroyed property in Paris, London and other European cities.

The Soviets covertly channelled funds to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and to the National Union of Mineworkers during the 1984 strike. And though FBI director J. Edgar Hoover‚Äôs suspicions that Martin Luther King was receiving Russian funds were unfounded, Soviet propagandists used American racism to discredit Washington‚Äôs claim to moral leadership during the Cold War. Whenever the USSR was criticised for its human rights abuses, the standard official rebuttal ‚Äòand you lynch Negroes‚Äô was so proverbial that it became shorthand for Soviet whataboutism.

Today, Russian propagandists no longer have to recruit useful idiots to further their cause. They can simply speak directly to millions through social media. And their task is easier than for earlier generations of influencers, because instead of spreading the message of communism, the modern Russian trolls‚Äô aim is a simple reversal of St Francis of Assisi‚Äôs prayer: to bring discord in place of harmony, error instead of truth, and despair where there is hope.

But what is most chilling of all is that perhaps for the first time since the Great Depression, Russia‚Äôs latest divisive interference comes in a period when not only the US‚Äôs leadership of the free world, but also its faith in itself, are starting to waver. The hostile takeover of the once-moderate US Republican party by Trumpian nationalists on the right and the destruction of classical liberalism by the zealotry of political correctness on the left makes America more vulnerable than ever to the kind of toxic nihilism put out by the Kremlin.

Brexit and an ongoing crisis in confidence in the EU across the continent are also music to the Kremlin‚Äôs ears. Any kind of discord in the West reinforces Putin‚Äôs fundamental message to his own people and to the world that democracy is a weakness, not a strength. Vladimir Lenin, quoting Nikolai Chernyshevsky, wrote ‚Äòthe worse, the better‚Äô of the collapsing Tsarist regime. The same is true for Putin. The more divided the West is by its own culture wars, the better his own rule looks in comparison. Putin, presiding over a corrupt and ailing economy that is just one fifteenth the size of America‚Äôs, cannot hope to destroy what the KGB used to call the main adversary. But Russia can help ‚Äî and certainly is helping ‚Äî America and its allies to destroy themselves.",,/r/europe/comments/hy2j0e/putin_plans_to_make_the_west_destroy_itself/fza4lvx/,casualphilosopher1,1595747259

353,"Well, as I said it's a thin line. Of course things can go wrong and there can be censoring of news that probably should not be censored. Thing is, if you look historically ""tyranny of the mob"" is the best we got. Criticism of it is good and needed, so we can improve where possible, but there is no working alternative. All the countries that have performed the best and been the most peaceful in the last century were democracies or countries that eventually turned democratic.

  


Its true, opinion is subjective and yes, you should allow both opinions, so that you can listen to them and decide for yourself, but you do this to get closer to a right opinion. Everybody makes mistakes, that includes the people you talk to, as well as yourself, so any opinion might be flawed. Ultimate goal of this is to improve your opinions and then share with others what you learned, this is the best way for a society to progress. I also think this minimizes the -shoving your worldview down other people's throat- part. Because if you are actually interested in improving your opinion and the other person is as well, there is a clear way for an agreement.

  


I don't want to control people, I make mistakes as well and I need other people to figure them out. If I control others, I am at risk of ignoring my own faults. This is also why I try not to use rhetorical tools, people use it to controle the discussion with language and in the process ruin the discussion.

The convention therefore lays formal ground to promote non-biological definitions of gender, which are deemed unconstitutional.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/hxssqu/poland_to_leave_european_treaty_on_violence/fz9uq8m/,Blackturtle99,1595738957

This is completely inappropriate. Keep that nonsense out of this sub. People are not being locked up based on their ethnicity or religion. They are being locked up because they have or tried to illegally enter(ed) another country. People *voluntarily* coming to another country illegally being locked up is completely different from a country locking up its own citizens based on their ethnicity or religion. You are only cheapening the meaning of the term by conflating these two situations.

This kind of rhetoric is being used on purpose by people who want to paint everyone who does not support letting every illegal migrant in as ""racist and evil"".

But maybe you could provide your own peer reviewed research to contradict this instead of embarrassing yourself further.

&gt;Alabi (2006:57) and Cammack et al (1988:13) have observed that the colonization of Africa by European powers in the 19th century created political units that divided ethnic groups in some cases and combined rival groups in others. As currently composed, boundaries of most Africa states were arbitrarily drawn without regard to ethnic and cultural affinities. In some cases, European boundaries forced starkly different, rival cultures to cohabit within the confines of a single state. The impacts of these borders were felt to varying degrees from one country to the other throughout Africa. For instance, the Akan speaking peoples were split between Ghana and cote d‚Äô lvoire; the Ewe ethnic group has also been split between Ghana and Togo while many Yoruba are found in the Benin Republic. It should be noted that since the 1950‚Äôs when Africa nations started to gain independence, these arbitrary borders have more often than not become source of conflict.",,/r/europe/comments/hxq0xx/europe_but_europe_colonised_it/fz9azyn/,Jacobinister,1595726017

646,"That episode of Panserbism didn't mean what it would mean today. There was significantly division between Serbs and Croats (and Bosniacs and Montenegrins, but they weren't recognised) than there is now. When they said 'Serb' they really meant Yugoslav. Proof is the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Nachertaniye proposed a 'Greater Serbia' but they went with Yugoslavia upon achieving their goal. It was a weird form of Panslavism.

Our identity is the same as is culture. Our 'cultures' are more similar than Bavarian and Holsteiner subcultures... As for history we do have different histories, but so do Germans. And yes, our culture has been shaped for 1000+ years but only in the direction of unification, seeing as we come from different tribes.

The East-West division is purely a political thing, not cultural. You can't incorporate politics in any science, or else it stops being an objective science.

Yes and Western Christianity is very similar... Protestantism is different from Catholicism about as much as Orthodoxy. Oh and also remember that one time 10,000,000 people died for religion in Germany? And btw, Lithuanians were split between Catholicism and Orthodoxy so same as Yugoslavs...

So currently, we are all the same thing? Doesn't that mean the idea of Yugoslavia is valid according to your own assumptions? You can't base an identity around religion...

Kajkavica and ƒçakavica are dialects, not languages... I can perfectly understand them even though neither was by any means ever spoken here

I said *speak* not 'spoke the same dialect'. Also the Vienna Literary Agreement changed all 3 (2) languages grammatically so yeah... But those weren't that big changes. You can still understand texts in older BCS dialects without issues. It's not like languages were killed. I am glad though that Slovenes didn't go fully with it. I don't think they are the same thing as us.

So one newspaper can show how people felt? The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was a failure. Being ruled by an Orthodox king, Catholics and Muslims were bound to be discriminated against sooner or later, in one way or another. Couple this with the country being completely broke.

Croats and Slovenes could've walked out as soon as 1974. Just follow 3 simple conditions and you can leave! But they didn't. The reason Croats and Slovenes wanted out at all was the 80's crisis and corruption. In such conditions people always start throwing blame at different groups.

684,"But look how you identify and qualify in your own view the type of community which forms the Turkey sub while at the same time you say that a symbolic act of not linking to the sub from the sidebar (while still naming it, Turkey is included and ontopic in this sub) is in your view 1) *disproportionate* and lacks 2) *substantial proof* within the context of *distributive behavior* as a neighboring/encompassing sub which is what Europe sub is to Turkey sub. 

Point 1 is subjective but for the life of me I cannot think of a smaller, less impactful symbolic act than what was done given the disruption, and for point 2) besides your own categorization of the community which is one possible evidence you supply yourself, linking from the sub and brigading was common at the time where links would even stay up for hours at end - at least this is my observation within a perhaps brief snapshot period of time during that era where all this occurred. 

The brigading that used to occur here I understand is well known by regulars. The Europe mod team‚Äôs statement indicates they couldn‚Äôt get the Turkey mods on board, and there is little reason to doubt their word given all the evidence but more importantly, the Turkey mods‚Äô reply announcement which speaks volumes about the whole affair, in my view. I gave the mods of Turkey the benefit of the doubt knowing how mod work can be very tricky and complicated at times until that reply statement. Also this was all about brigading as far as I remember. The thread about wikipedia and related events was what I believe was the last straw, in an unrelated way as it didn‚Äôt impact this sub directly, from what I recall, but I could be wrong and there may have been threads and crossposts back and forth. 

Bottom line is that when a specific community on Reddit can be disruptive to another community, something which happens all the time in Reddit, it‚Äôs hard to blame the latter when it does something about it, specially if it is something innocuous and symbolic! And in this case I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs  warranted to take this symbolic act as something against all Turkish users, specially when there are many Turkish users here which contribute quite positively.

716,"&gt;Since for one, it is an international treaty rather than a constitutional document, meaning that ratification is a matter of member states agreeing on it without any parliamentary approval needed .The Treaty-based system de-facto turned the EU heavily intergovernmental as a result, instead of rule-of-law based.

The *Treaty establishing a Constitution of Europe* was also an international treaty, and as I said, Lisbon Treaty is *de facto* constitutional document, without being explicitly called one. There definition of constitution is that it's the fundamental rules from which all lower rules follow. It doesn't need explicitly be called a ""constitution"" to be a constitution. And the Lisbon Treaty is the fundamental treaty where currently all lower EU rules follow. And Lisbon Treaty also was ratified by countries in their parliaments, as [seen from this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification_of_the_Treaty_of_Lisbon).

There is no 'permanent divide'. You're projecting abstract arbitrary borders as solid blocks dividing people completely. I identify as Bosnian, am legally a Serb and speak a dialect most similar to Eastern Slavonian. I don't see any border between any of these.

Again with your 'civilisational blocs' which are completely arbitrary lines used by revisionists. Religion didn't divide Germans, Brits, Hungarians, Lithuanians etc. but it does divide Yugoslavs. Go figure. Also what with Atheists like me? 'Different native languages' how so? They are all the same language and in case you don't know, modern BCS is founded on the old East Herzegovinian dialect which counter intuitively comes from Dubrovnik and spread by trade. So how do we speak different languages? Also most Croats speak ≈°tokavica anyway. 'Long term influences' have proven time and time again throughout history not to necessarily be a defining factor.

'Recent history' has been shaped by ultra-nationalists, war profiters and others who could never bring any good. There's a reason ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá was a Panslavist.

I've often wondered why it is that most subbredits denaturate into a steaming-hot mess of divisiveness as soon as they reach critical mass and what could be done to mitigate the problem. 

If you compare /r/Europe to /r/AskEurope, for instance, you will find that the latter is much more civil and generally more welcoming and much less divisive. I've come to the conclusion that it not the users that make the difference - more often than not, the same people frequent both subs - but the *content*. 

Look at what's going on here: This is an obviously political sub that lives and dies by sharing political content other people have created, such as articles from various major news outlets all over the place.

I'm not going to repeat myself since you clearly don't want to get it anway. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do I really need to go into the roundabout arguments you throw in here  

You can try it if you can. 

More proof that you are uninformed and spearding nonsense: 

&gt;nonsense about how you don't want to buy American LNG (hint: nobody is forcing you,  you can keep buying gas through the already existing pipelines and  expand upon those if needed). 

Nobody is forcing us? If you would know what you are talking about you would know that the US is currently trying to force their LNG (""freedom gas"") on us by trying to stop NS2 with illegal extraterritorial sanctions. 

We also are expanding on currently existing pipelines. We are expanding on NS1. An Expansion where we don't have to pay transit fees.

And we also will keep buying gas trough existing pipelines due to increasing demand, it just will be less.

&gt;Or how you apparently don't see how Germans went into the streets after  a tsunami in Japan and then projected that situation upon their own  country where there is 0% chance of that happening.

The chance for a tsunami hitting us is 0 the chance for something else going wrong is not 0. That you think we are idiots with a fear of tsunamis only shows how delusional you are.

On the other hand most people have slippers that they put on after they wake up and walk around with while in their pyjamas or whatever, and they use them until they change into streetwear, but still most of them even when they get home after work/school won't change into the slippers until they change into their pyjamas which may be 3 or 4 hours afterwards. It never made much sense to me honestly, I used to change into slippers or flip flops during summer due to heat, but for example during winter I'd rather keep my shoes on for extra cold protection. It may not make sense, it's just what I've always done until I moved to germany.

It is also true that leaders encouraged isolation but not enclaves. Enclaves have became a thing only because of the violence towarded to them, while economic isolation was both due to some GCs cutting them off and the nationalist leadership limiting economic relations within TCs. The language thing sure had happened, as in some coffee shops of Greek speaking Turkish Cypriot villages, nobody had spoken for weeks due to the ban but yeah. Not like all island was full of enclaves as many villages were mixed still, and close-by other ethnicity villages mostly had good relations, including EOKA and TMT members having relations with those still - which is sure weird for any outsider to grasp about our island. :) Things weren't just limited to that either but also trade-unions and associations including teachers' associations were also divided and all TC members asked to cut ties with their former unions but I doubt if we can argue that these were for taksim as partitioning the island was impossible without a military intervention and ethnic disruptions, sadly we saw at the end of the day.",Grotesque Banana Republic of Northern Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/hujhc1/greek_father_cries_over_the_grave_of_his_son_that/fz78xjo/,cametosaybla,1595689179

People spend 12 hours a day on social media and see the USA and think that their country is the same.

The problems that European states face are different in nature and intensity depending on the country. For instance, as an Italian I would argue that one of the problems of Italy is that it is not capitalist enough. Taxation is too dams high, and everything is too much regulated, which means that people don't invest in new businesses and already existing businesses struggle. Also, tax evasion is insanely high and to a certain extent it is TOLERATED by the government, cause they know small businesses wouldn't survive. On top of that, a stupid amount of tax money goes straight into the pockets of corrupt politicians and mafias, so it doesn't really benefit the people.

1078,"&gt; I just checked modmail: you've never sent us any report with regards to any specific users. 

Does that invalidate my point?

&gt; If you want to send me examples of posts you think violate the rules, contribute to toxicity in the sub, and should be addressed, maybe we can talk about said examples rather than pure theory.

I don't keep a naughty list Santa style. I would need to compile it. If you insist, I could do that, but you can do exactly what I would end up doing and just go to the sub's hot tab, pick a contentious submission and find the most provocative replies. The best results will likely be found under submissions involving some of the sub's ""untouchables"" (the fact that such group exists here should give you a pause), ie. Poles, Hungarians, Turks, the British, etc. Then keep repeating the exercise for the next few days, weeks, months. You'll notice it's the same usernames over and over, and that they rarely if ever engage in normal discussion. The sole purpose of their presence in r/Europe is to stir negative emotions.

Alternatively you can pay attention to contentious submissions themselves. I'm sure you'll quickly notice several usernames posting those and nothing else, quite often specializing in targeting one nation, group or topic.

A person who posts one kind of thing over and over for months and years is obviously breaking rule 7: no agenda pushing. But it's hard to break rule 7 without breaking rules number 2 and 5 along the way (the latter rule seems to be completely dead). And then there's the rule 8 saying ""No flamebait or other bad-faith participation: Participation with the intent of provoking an angry response by other users and other participation in bad faith is prohibited."" - which is exactly the behavior that I think is currently ruining r/Europe. Discussions under certain topics consist almost exclusively of flamebait and bad-faith participation.

Moody‚Äôs has described Lloyds Banking Group‚Äôs programme to promote more black employees to senior roles as ‚Äúcredit positive‚Äù, marking the first time that the rating agency has explicitly linked a company‚Äôs stability to ethnic diversity measures.  

Lloyds, the UK‚Äôs number one bank by current accounts, announced a race action plan last week after a promise to ‚Äúdo more‚Äù to promote equality in response to global protests that erupted following the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in May.  The bank acknowledged that some groups were ‚Äústill significantly under-represented‚Äù within its ranks. Its programme includes a target of increasing fivefold the proportion of senior roles held by black employees by 2025, and publicly releasing data on its ethnicity pay gap.¬† 

 In a note published on Thursday, Moody‚Äôs said the bank‚Äôs efforts were ‚Äúcredit positive because they will improve staff diversity at all levels and reduce Lloyds‚Äô exposure to social risk‚Äù.  

Edoardo Calandro, a vice-president and senior analyst at Moody‚Äôs, said this marked the first time the agency had ‚Äúresponded directly, and with credit implications, to a diversity programme for black employees and other ethnic minorities established by a private sector firm‚Äù.  Investors and rating agencies are increasingly considering businesses‚Äô environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, as sustainability moves up the political agenda. Social risks are typically those that affect the community in which a company operates, such as through health and safety, working conditions or economic opportunity.  

Mr Calandro added that the bank‚Äôs cost of funding was unlikely to be affected by its new social policy in the short term, but called it a ‚Äúpositive step‚Äù. The agency left Lloyds‚Äô rating unchanged, at single A with a negative outlook.  

The debate over racial equality has moved from the streets to the boardroom, with pressure building on companies to increase diversity in their top tiers. Numerous businesses have come under fire for failing to actively address workplace inequality.  Diversity programmes have typically focused on improving the representation of women or black and minority ethnic employees across the workforce as a whole. 

By concentrating on promoting black employees to senior roles, Mr Calandro said Lloyds had ‚Äútaken a specific action on a specific category to close a gap within the gap. That‚Äôs a step further than what we‚Äôve seen elsewhere‚Äù.  

Mr Calandro added that besides the incentive to boost the company‚Äôs creditworthiness, such actions could help keep businesses on the right side of ESG-focused asset managers. ‚ÄúThere are funds and investors which are actively avoiding banks which are not sufficiently diverse,‚Äù he said.  Earlier this month, Institutional Shareholder Services, one of the most influential shareholder advisers, urged American companies to disclose the ethnicities of their senior directors.¬†

  ‚ÄúPolicies that indicate strong management of diversity and inclusion \[are\] supportive of overall good risk management within the business,‚Äù said Samantha Lamb, head of ESG for fixed income at Aberdeen Standard Investments.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/hxmciy/moodys_says_lloyds_ethnic_diversity_plan_is/fz6ybwt/,Hematophagian,1595682134

And in a few places there were indeed ambiguities about biological and fantasy gender, and there were buckles that spoke clearly about same-sex families / couples. Then came many non-governmental organizations, half of which were created just to suck money into the ventulano, not that the rest would do any work and would only interfere. In the end, it became clear that the evangelical church had further developed fears about gender, and the LGB communities responded no less idiotically and nailed the last nail in the coffin of this resolution. Technically, the laws on domestic violence and violence against women need only some adjustments, they need to be implemented and have better trained staff for the purposes, and society itself should be more responsible for the problem, not just listen to the cries of neighbors and I drank my beer / it's the same everywhere /.

Namely, masks, mass testing, surveillance and lockdown on public gathering spaces. I know WHO compromised themselves lately but still, they have more data and knowledge on the subject than FHM.

https://theistanbulinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/blue-mosque-aerial.jpg

Surely you are not suggesting they look ""very"" different from each other. So what does it mean to ""look like a church""?

&gt;It was built as a church. 

Historical fact yes but..kind of irrelevant?

&gt;Isnt it blasphemy to pray in a place of worship originally designed for something else?

Islam doesn't deny Christianity. It simply says it is ""outdated"" so to speak. Jesus is still a holy man according to Islam. So no, it really is not. 

Considering it was turned into a mosque carefully by the Caliph which is basically ""the head of Islam"" or successor of Muhammed. So at that point, it is the will of God.

&gt;Imagine if this was originally a satanic temple.

But it is not so why imagine that? It is a weird leap unless you suggest Christianity equals Satanism in the eyes of a muslim then you are clearly mistaken.

&gt;Honestly, it should be restored as a church.

This is where i totally disagree, it should be a museum nothing more nothing less. It could be open to *both* or *neither* but not just one. It signifies something important for both cultures and considering it was ""lost"" by Christians, it makes no sense to say it should be a Church again just because Atat√ºrk had the good sense to make it a museum over a mosque.

&gt; I know this is a power move to piss off the greeks and christians around europe but this is just petty.

That is just the side effect. It is a move to gain votes from extremists. You put too much importance on the side effect instead of the wanted effect. Which actually didn't really do what he wanted, this is why he keeps attacking Atat√ºrk via religion hoping to create a response that he can use to call it ""anti-islam"" and gain votes.

Sorry for the serious response but i am tired of such nonsense. Just because everybody with a working brain can agree it shouldn't have been made a mosque again doesn't mean it gives you the freeway to just say nonsense.",,/r/europe/comments/hx9l2b/erdogan_joins_thousands_to_pray_for_first_time_at/fz6pxsz/,Ecmelt,1595674660

&gt; Foreign ownership can become a threat to freedom of expression and free media, as it simply replaces one form of monopoly (in most cases, state monopoly) with another, and there are strong indications that aggressive commercial policies by foreign investors have been pursued at the expense of journalistic standards.   In Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, for example, the influx of foreign capital has threatened media pluralism, and the dominance of foreign companies may stymy democratic media.  The domination of the German print media group, Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), across the CEE region, is a cause for concern, as the company‚Äôs ownership of local and national media in large parts of the region raises some questions over conflict of interest and plurality.  Large media also takes advantage of the fact that employment law, particularly in the ways that is applies to media workers, is weak in most of the region.

Yepp and the further we go back in time the more agricultural societies were so more people lived on farms. And also because diseases and wars were much more frequent the parents mightve died and the children then were raised with their uncles/aunts or even by their oldest siblings. Or just 2 or more families lived together and worked on the same farm and so from a practical point of view it was one family.

Nuclear family is a very new form of family, which is very small and very different compared to what we had before. 

In a nuclear family the father is expected to get enough salary for his entire family, the mother is expected be a housewife and caretaker of the kids alone. This is already not really feasable in our today's world where even the mother have to work and the father have to take care of the kids and housework as much as the mother. The conservatives wish of every family should be a nuclear type family is harmful and toxic.

Would be nice to live in a world where the nuclear family structure could work tho.",(HU) Landlocked pirate,/r/europe/comments/hx6yp9/protest_in_hungary_for_the_freedom_of_press/fz6ipfc/,Spyt1me,1595667111

1307,"You left out a bit there:
&gt; So I suggest you and the other hypocrits stop pretending that this isn't about cost. The US wants to force their expensive ""freedom gas"" onto the European market while not being able to make a competitive offer. Eastern Europe wants transit fees and cheap Russian gas, while at the same time refusing deal with the consequences that come with it. 

Why do you feel that US and Eastern Europes hypocrisy doesn't matter? 

The US wants to enforce their economic interests at our expense. And if it's all about the geopolitical situation for Eastern Europe they have the option to completely turn to US LNG. If they don't want that it is their problem. 

But your posts already made clear that it is only fine for you as long as Germany has to pay more. You want us to pay transit fees for the existing pipelines and cover our increasing demand with expensive US LNG. Why do you think we should take all the disadvantages in this situation?

&gt; Or... you could use the pipelines through Eastern Europe instead or expand on those. 

So we have to pay even more transit fees if we expand them and they can extort us even more whenever they want to pressure us on other issues? No thanks. And even in this scenario the US would be against it, because guess what: THEY WANT TO SELL THEIR LNG. With the rising gas demands the existing piplines through eastern Europe are still going to be used albeit to a lesser extent and we are redistributing part of the gas from NS2 anyway. If they don't want to take that redistributed gas it's their problem. 

&gt; Norway is also nearby. Poland is actually busy with them to connect the countries.

And you think we are not connected? Norway is our 3rd biggest gas supplier and they are going to also benefit from our increased demand. If you want to suggest that Norway could cover what Russia is going to provide I'd like to see a study that supports that and I'd like to know at what cost. And on the topic of connection: The gas through NS2 gets distributed from Germany to other EU countries as well.

&gt; Or you could try to lessen your natural gas usage, with climate change going on and all that.

Or you could come up with a energy storage for renewable energy.

Why do you think our gas demand is going to rise so much in the first place? 

We have two big issues with our energy supply: 

1) We are going to shut down our nuclear and coal power plants. All of them, which is why we need something else to cover our base load, when renewable energy production is low. Nuclear get's shut down because the majority is afraid of accidents like in Tschernobyl and Fukushima and no one can and wants to take responsibility in the unlikely case and accident happens (were it up to me those plants would still be running). And coal because of climate change. Both of those shut downs are very expensive and the tax payer and energy consumers have to pay for most of the insane cost. 

2) Our energy mix is going more and more towards renewables which tend to fluctuate a lot and unlike some scandinavian countries we don't have a lot of options for pumped storage power plants. So we have to provide backup power that can be used to cover base load when renewable energy production is low and this backup power needs to be able to be turned on/off quickly because of said fluctuations. Something nuclear can't do and and coal isn't good at either. 

Gas can do both, cover base load and mitigate power fluctuations from renewable energy sources. Gas is also still a lot better for the climate than coal.",,/r/europe/comments/hwecq2/german_businesses_working_on_response_to_us_nord/fz6iumk/,-GrimmWar-,1595667258

1387,"I want to share what Finnish national news published about Sweden's situation yesterday. Because now in July they're doing far better than you might think from above data.

[Article in Finnish.](https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11456809) I only ask you to look at the graphs. I'll explain them. They're all from Sweden's national health care ministry.

First set of 3 graphs about COVID-19, near the top:

1. New patients requiring intensive care, per day.
2. Reported deaths, per day. This is the most significant one.
3. New cases per day.

kes√§ = kes√§kuu = June  
hein√§ = hein√§kuu = July

So while the 3rd graph clearly agrees with the data you saw in this topic, the seriousness of the disease has gone down greatly this month compared to peaks in June. That's an important measure on how it impacts the society since if it was ""just a flu"" then nobody would've taken special measures in the first place. Article says they still haven't seen anyone get it twice so perhaps we should interpret this as the least vulnerable people getting it now.

The article overall discusses stuff like how many people need to catch it for the society as a whole to become resistant. If vaccine based models say 60%, then Swedish mathematicians have published articles saying that's only 40-45% when catching the disease naturally because then the supposed immunity is targeted at the most socially active people who would be most likely to catch/spread it in the first place.

Nobody knows how long the immunity will last though. So far 6 months seems a likely minimum.

Second set of 3 graphs, near the bottom, discusses potential future cases. Blue curves are predictions/modeling, red is actual observed cases.",,/r/europe/comments/hx7ti5/covid19_cases_in_europe_past_14_days/fz6jobi/,Ksielvin,1595668123

1561,"Why don't I just live you to argue on my account, since you seem to know better than me what my views are and what I apparently imply through my comments? Also thanks for claiming that I am responsible for oppression, and that I am fine with dividing people into superior vs inferior groups (which is kind of ironic, given all that you've written).

You claim that it is righteous that if you strongly believe into ideology, ethical system, etc., no matter how new, you can force others to adopt it. In addition, it is absolutely fine to quickly disregard all those who disagree with any aspect of your idea, and even if they question it, they must be shut down and punished. As such, you believe that if there is an ethical system or an idea that you believe in above anything else, all others who fail to adhere to all your standards must be enemies. They are automatically stripped from the right to question your idea, and to express their idea. Under no condition is it allowed, if your idea is superior to theirs, to attempt to understand the latter party. Either they are with you, or they must be exterminated. No discussion. No disagreement. Only compliance. Use force, not brains to spread your ideas. 

I don't agree with any of these ideas. If people have different morals, we must understand where they are coming from to be able to change their minds. We must understand where they are coming from acquired their views. We must evaluate their views and ours to see where they meet and how they differ.

Believe it or not, the latter method is what actually works, and the former one only radicalised people even more. The idea of dividing people into me Vs them never worked in anyone's favour. It has always been known that to change someone's mind you must never claim you and your ideas are superior to theirs and that they are a failure not to adhere to your ideas. Most notable examples are with fighting vaccine skepticism, where people are always discouraged from using the former method.

Also, you don't get money from blindly agreeing to one ideology over another, and it never has been. And secularism  does not mean people's religion shouldn't be protected.

By the way, as for someone so renowned into politics, you fail to see that Poland leaving EU would set a catastrophic domino of events (since Hungary and Czechia are close alliances of Poland in social issues), and will be destructive to both EU and those nations involved?

1577,"The clock is ticking down. The ports are being prepared, customs officials are being hired on both sides of the English Channel, and companies are being warned to make sure they have new systems in place. After yet another tense round of negotiations, this week it looked more likely than ever the UK would end its transition agreement with the EU without a trade deal. The two sides remain as far apart as ever on fishing, and a level playing field on regulations and state aid. After months of talks, there is no sign of positions shifting.

The EU keeps saying it genuinely wants a deal. But if that is true, there is a simple solution. It should fire Michel Barnier, its chief negotiator. Over three years, the Frenchman has been a complete failure. High-handed, patronising and provocative, he never seems to have grasped that the job of a negotiator is to find a compromise, not simply antagonise the other side.

A deal is there to be done. But Barnier himself has turned into the main obstacle. Replace him and the talks could get off to a fresh start‚Äìand still succeed before Christmas. After Britain left the EU, it was, to put it mildly, a slight surprise that Barnier was appointed to lead the trade negotiations.

After all, he had hardly been a great success negotiating the withdrawal agreement. He massively overplayed his hand, making a series of demands so outrageous that no self-respecting country could ever accept them.
Even though former prime minister Theresa May would take almost any terms, he pushed so far that he provoked a rebellion in the Conservative Party, secured a worse deal and then the election of a government committed to Brexit with a thumping majority. A good outcome for the EU? Not really.

As trade negotiator, he has just pressed the repeat button. The UK gets lectures on state aid from an EU which has just waved through ‚Äì to take only one example ‚Äì a massive bailout of the German airline Lufthansa that will involve massive subsidies and protection from takeovers.

And we are subjected to endless bizarre, hard-to-follow speeches about how our proximity means we can‚Äôt possibly trade on the same terms as Canada or Japan ‚Äì when, to any neutral observer, the complete opposite would seem to be true.

Hardcore Remainers love to describe Barnier as a ‚Äúmaster negotiator‚Äù with a ‚Äúgrasp of detail‚Äù that ‚Äúruns rings‚Äù around the ‚Äúamateurish‚Äù British. The immense size of the EU market meant we would have to accept pretty much whatever we were offered. But negotiating isn‚Äôt just about making demands, threatening retaliation and goading the other side. The actual objective is to find a deal. Often, that will mean calming ruffled feelings, dialling down the rhetoric and tracking down the common ground, the compromises, and the concessions that can be made.

Measured by that standard, Barnier has been completely hopeless. The result? Even though a deal is clearly in the interests of both sides, right now it looks as if it will be impossible.

The UK has changed its team plenty of times already. Since this process began, we have been through two prime ministers, three Brexit secretaries (and four if you count the abolition of the department) and a couple of chief negotiators. Through it all, Barnier just sails on and on, failing to reach an amicable agreement in round after round of talks.

If the British Government wasn‚Äôt refusing his demands for an extension, he‚Äôd probably be there in 2030, still lecturing everyone, still priding himself on his fantastic negotiating skills and still without an agreement. It would be easy to break out of that cycle. Fire Barnier, and appoint a replacement. That would have two big advantages. First, it would give the talks a fresh start, and send a powerful signal that the dialogue was about to change, and on the EU as well as the British side of the table. The tone would immediately be different.

Next, it would allow both sides some wriggle room. A new EU negotiator could easily argue he or she had reviewed the mandate and come up with a slightly different set of compromises, while the British could likewise trim their demands and get away with it politically. For breaking a deadlock, some fresh faces often make all the difference. And of course, if we are being honest, it would help if the EU‚Äôs chief negotiator wasn‚Äôt French (I mean, let‚Äôs face it, we irritate them and they sure irritate us sometimes).

A Swedish, Dutch or Finnish chief negotiator could probably get an amicable deal wrapped up in no time.
A deal is massively in the interests of both sides. The EU runs a ¬£72bn trade surplus with Britain. Sure, it can live without that, but tariffs and customs checks will still hurt, and even more so at a time when Covid-19 has already created the worst economic downturn in almost a century. And the EU may not be as important a market as Project Fear sometimes argued, but it still accounts for 43pc of our exports.

We could manage on World Trade Organisation terms, but we would certainly be better off without the disruption that would cause.

Companies, tourists and even pets will all face extra hassle without an agreement. But right now, Barnier himself is the main obstacle to achieving that. Over three years, he has turned himself into part of the problem, not part of the solution. Of course, this is the EU. It doesn‚Äôt ever sack people for failing (because, heck, once you started where would you stop?). But, in truth, Barnier should have been fired a long time ago and replaced by someone who knew how to reach a deal ‚Äì and without him that could still be achievable.",,/r/europe/comments/hxhp6g/if_the_eu_wants_a_deal_the_solution_is_simple/fz67e9j/,casualphilosopher1,1595656265

1579,"It's a very simplistic way of looking at the protests, be cautious of this account. I go to the protests because the prosecution selectively only accuses people in the opposition of the government but doesn't lift a finger when someone in power is accused of something.

How come they dont want to look at that but don't mind pinning the protests on him and selectively releasing his calls for the public?

1611,"&gt; Turkey has complained bitterly about the lack of support from the German government for its accession campaign, which started in 2005. Recently, negotiations have all but ground to a halt over opposing views on crucial issues, including human rights and a divided Cyprus.

&gt; France has also resisted the idea of Turkey‚Äôs full accession and, with Cyprus and the European Commission, has blocked movement on all but 13 of the 35 policy areas, called chapters, that countries striving for membership must complete. Turkey has so far completed only one.

&gt; ‚ÄúI think a long negotiating path lies ahead of us,‚Äù Ms. Merkel said ‚ÄúAlthough I am skeptical, I agreed with the continuation of membership discussions. We are engaging in these with an open result.‚Äù

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/world/europe/merkel-gives-turkey-hope-for-eu-membership.html

&gt; Turkey's chances of a breaking a three-year stalemate and relaunching its bid to join the European Union look like being dashed because of the government's ruthless response to three weeks of street protests amid worsening friction between Ankara and Berlin.

&gt; Merkel had said earlier this week that she was ""appalled at the very tough"" response by the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, in ordering riot police to clear central Istanbul of thousands of protesters last weekend.

&gt; Negotiations were supposed to resume next week after a long hiatus because the French president, Fran√ßois Hollande, lifted the block imposed by his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, as a gesture of goodwill. Talks were to take place on regional development, an issue that could have influenced Ankara's policy towards parts of the south-east populated mainly by Kurds who have long been campaigning for greater rights and more devolved government.
&gt; 
&gt; But Germany and the Netherlands are refusing a green light for next week's resumption, triggering a European debate over the most sensible response to the turmoil in Turkey.
&gt; 
&gt; Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister, is among those who argue strongly that Europe should not turn its back on Turkey but engage more fully. Advocates of engagement point out that resuming negotiations would help the protesters campaigning against what is seen as an increasingly authoritarian government, because the new protest movement is broadly sympathetic to a more European Turkey.

&gt; During the extreme police violence against the demonstrators last weekend, the European parliament sharply denounced the Erdoƒüan government's response.

1636,"when you are comparing countries to each other, the cost for russians to build a house in russia is irrelevant.  that is comparing the country to itself.  Russia's GDP is 1.6 trillion.  American GDP is 20.5 trillion.  Brazil makes more money than you.  South korea, a country with no natural resources that is 170 times smaller than you makes as much money as you.  What are you not getting here?

&amp;#x200B;

when you are comparing countries, you are comparing the purchasing power of each country on the world market, not your internal market.  so your inflation multiplier used in your PPP number, which only works when buying inside your country goods produced in your country.  your internal ppp does not matter to the rest of the world.  it is not the power of your economy on the macroeconomic market.  you have no power there, and the fact that you can now buy more russian grown potatoes in a russian bazaar does not change that.

&amp;#x200B;

as far as your strawman - if everything produced in russia.  world market.  we would not produce it here - we produce things that make us more money.  we would buy it from russia at russia's cheap price.  which for us is pennies.  which is what shows you our strong economy vs your weak one.

I've always given you honest statements, don't know why you would say that I'm lying, except maybe because this is another emotionalized language. 

I'm not uncomfortable with any sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, don't know why you would make such statement since none of my comments contain any information which would point to me antagonizing any of these things. 
It's also funny how you brought race into this, given how I never mentioned it, and even told you that Poland has explicit laws against discrimination based on race, ethnicity and faith.

And now some ad persona: If you grew up amongst politicians, you should be able to express yourself without ton of insults, antagonistic language. You would also be able to see there is another side to your view. Less than half of what you say can be claimed to be arguments, most of which are slander.

1705,"""wanting to criminalise is not prosecution"" xd

Well, then wouldn't freedom of religion also qualify for neglecting human right too?

There is a reason laws in Poland are the way they are. That's because sacrificing one right for another based on a statement that is so bleak nobody can properly define ""hatred"" is not something that can be done in a functioning society. Even you yourself show a good example of that, since you can't differentiate between hatred and instead rely on your own preferences, not a standard, to judge who should be punished or not (to quote your  ""right wing fuckheads, I think this would seem like a hateful comment too). 

And there is a great differentiation between sliding into dictatorship and not following a current trend (which is very, very new, on the national history scale, the movement started to pick up motion around the second half of the 2010s). History shows why one party determining what is righteous and what isn't, not out of golden standards but out of their current feel towards an issue, and then punishing everyone who doesn't side with their recently changed mind, leads to totalitarian rule.  At no time in history has political reform changed society. And it never will. It only led to the persecution of ideas and people. That's why openness to discuss is the way forward, not force.

And I would definitely say, the way you pronounce and antagonize the other party on a strictly political issue, especially given that the views you are promoting are very new, is much closer to totalitarianism than what you antagonize. The fact you think you get to find a new definition for which countries are akin to a dictatorship, not because of their overall rule, but due to their stance on one singular (very new) political issue, is more frightening and is not something that should be done under any circumstance. This is akin to mob rule and rule of force, and will never be just.",,/r/europe/comments/hwjrcu/ikea_sued_by_polish_government_for_sacking/fz5gl3z/,SomeoneNamedSomeone,1595638605

1735,"If you think forbidding homophobia is a violation of human rights then you have come into this argument with bad faith pretending to be about European Unity but wanting to defend gross and unjustifiable positions.

You cannot be serious in trying to conflate prejudice against someone's inherent state of being vs judging someone for their opinions. You know who else I hate? Nazis. I also hate Tankies because all these groups support authoritarian mass murder. I guess that makes me worse than the people who actively supported Stalin... Don't come up with bullshit about tolerating intolerance, that is the death of freedom for the individual. One person's rights end when another person's begin.

Also at no time in history political reform has changed society is the dumbest thing anyone has said. Portugal enacted policy that decriminalised drugs before that was remotely popular (as we had the worst death rate in Europe by far) and it dramatically changed the landscape here, Portugal enshrined LGBT protections against hate crimes in our constitution in the 70s despite being a very catholic and pretty homophobic place at the time and people have since softened on their opinions. Complete lack of understanding and appreciation of even recent history. Perception follows policy on so many matters provided political popularity.

They're becoming a dictatorship because they've removed judicial separation from the executive and appoint judges who are not independent from the government. Because they are heavily involved in the press and forcing their side of the story to dominate reality. The fact that we are saying the government is launching this legal action against IKEA, when technically it is the public prosecutor, just goes to show the lack of separation of the branches of power which is the hallmark of a dictatorship. I'm by no means saying they're dictators because they hate gays I'm saying their authoritarians who are abusing the overwhelming executive to further prejudice and prosecution against the gays they hate.

Most games require specific skillsets often based around reactions times and ""actions per minute"" (FPS, RTS, Sports) or specific mental attributes/thinking patterns (strategy and tactics games) or the willingness to stare at and tweak many numbers and grind out very long questlines. If you can't/wont do any of those things, you can't get that buzz.

Games like Pokemon Go!, Sims, and Animal Crossing, however, are games with no specific requirements. You can log on for 30 minutes a day, do some very simple button pushing, and get a new item of clothing, or a new piece of furniture, or a new widget. You get that buzz in the simplest and easiest way. 

The reward of a shiny new thing for virtually no effort is one of the biggest drivers behind all mobile games and many non-mobile ones, human addiction to getting that buzz of achievement has a whole branch of psychology studying it to maximise profits for game makers.",,/r/europe/comments/hx3sbc/european_gaming_charts_first_half_year/fz5jgto/,beorrahn1,1595640279

1860,"Even though, we seem to have different views, knowledge thank you for the conversation. I also agree that these issues are not simple and most importantly deal with human life. Our issue with not integration though. Average Turkish and Kurdish are too similar, there are obviously some different characteristics. Back in the day, these characteristics were not tolerated sadly but it was a new republic which is forced to present a national identiy. Today is different though and characteristics are not entirely based on ethnicity. So Kurdish people are not the odd ones to adapt to the mainstream identity. The proble is independence. To be honest, I don‚Äôt really care if southeastern region is independent or not but many Kurdish origin people I know are happy to live here and I‚Äôm happy too. There are some huge political and security problems with independence though. Turkey had a chance to experience it beforehand with Syria. We have done many mistakes in Syria but we should have never involved with it but right now staying inside the border is not the option for us sadly. I hope things will resolve as soon as possible.
About Erdoƒüan, actually I‚Äôm tired of hating him, like many opposing Turkish people I‚Äôm numb. I‚Äôve already spent a good portion of my youth with him. His time will come eventually. Since you are interested in the region you could understand that his position is highly simplified in the Western media. He is a populist for sure and islamist but not nationalist. Many people can agree on that. Nobody knows what he is gonna support next day. There is no agenda against Kurdish. He may sing and dance to a Kurdish folk song and criticize Turkish nationalits daily all of a sudden just like he did 6-7 years ago. So I don‚Äôt think Erdoƒüan made a speech like that but if you have a source I‚Äôd like to see it.

Actually I would no longer push total ban, if I could make this decision again.

2059,"Even though I am opposed to neoliberalism, I have to point out that it is a cohesive ideology and not some scapegoat that you can blame for every shortcoming of policies resembling those advocated by the free-marketeers. Putinesque economic policy of Orb√°n's administration has one goal - actively crush every form of dissent, whilst gaining more power for him and his cronies. I should point out since of your mistakes and debunk some changes that were made here.

1. Fiscal discipline - Hungarian State under Orb√°n, because of it's highly irresponsible social policies and idiotic tax policy is debt-ridden as hell.

2. You seem to think that ,,flat tax preference"", ,,gradual elimination of workers rights"" and ,,regressive social policies""  are the pillars on which neoliberalism was founded. This is wrong on many levels. 

 A) Neoliberals wouldn't crave a flat income tax, but rather  NO income tax. This, in my opinion, is problematic to implement without hurting the budget to say the least, but the point remains...
 B) Gradual elimination of workers rights wouldn't be preferred either. They do not seek to end all regulation protecting the workers, but rather obsolete ones. I don't see any neoliberal going around arguing for child labor.
 C) Whatever you mean by ""regressive social policy"" this ain't it. They argue for ,,market-based healthcare"" instead of state-provided healthcare. This can turn out well like in the Netherlands, but without appropriate regulation it can transform into an absolute nightmare like in the US.

3. This study that you cite is an absolutely hilarious example of cherry-picking data and desperately trying to make a point. There is a hell of a lot of examples of flaws, but just to showcase a few of 'em:

a) This study claims that the goal of Orb√°n's policies is to end the ,,welfare state"". Far from it. He has repeatedly come out with support of state-provided healthcare, public schools are the crucial aspect of his propaganda machine and has repeatedly increased pensions.
b) This study mentions ,,punitive public works schemes"" in no way backing it up. This point is particularly hilarious, because public works are celebrated by left-leaning people as a great thing and hated by neoliberals. I would agree that most of those were ineffective and a way to defraud public money, but this doesn't redeem the horrible argument used.
c) ,,Lowered social assistance"" - lowered in some places, raised in others, particularly for the elderly.
d) ,,Family allowance was frozen from 2008-2017"" This is by far THE most moronic point - not only does it prove that the family allowances were frozen since even before Orb√°n, and since the Great Recession, but also showcases that they learned from their mistakes...

4. Regulation in place in Hungary and government policy of cronyism and defrauding European and domestic money are every neoliberal's nightmare. Orb√°n and his administration stifle competition and growth with it's corrupt and oligarchic policies.

These were only some points and I don't want to spend any more time debunking this debacle of a study. Although on the surface most points were good, they turned to be either shallow, not backed up by facts or innaccurate. Please, for the love of God, don't scapegoat neoliberalism and get that despite some idiotic free-market-esque policies implemented by some autocratic half-wits don't negate the fact that their policy is just populist.",Mazovia (Poland),/r/europe/comments/hwzr2j/orb√°n_hungarian_polish_forces_repelled/fz4bkcd/,FrenchyPole,1595617232

&gt;  
&gt;Journalist Roberto Saviano spent more than a decade exposing the criminal dealings of the Italian Mafia ( Getty )  
&gt;  
&gt;Britain is the most corrupt country in the world, according to journalist Roberto Saviano, who spent more than a decade exposing the criminal dealings of the Italian Mafia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Saviano, who wrote the best-selling expos√©s Gomorrah and ZeroZeroZero, made the comments at the Hay Literary Festival. The 36-year-old has been living under police protection since publishing revelations about members of the Camorra, a powerful Neapolitan branch of the mafia, in 2006.  
&gt;  
&gt;He told an audience at Hay-on-Wye: ‚ÄúIf I asked you what is the most corrupt place on Earth you might tell me well it‚Äôs Afghanistan, maybe Greece, Nigeria, the South of Italy and I will tell you it‚Äôs the UK. Read more  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the bureaucracy, it‚Äôs not the police, it‚Äôs not the politics but what is corrupt is the financial capital. 90 per cent of the owners of capital in London have their headquarters offshore.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúJersey and the Cayman‚Äôs are the access gates to criminal capital in Europe and the UK is the country that allows it. That is why it is important why it is so crucial for me to be here today and to talk to you because I want to tell you , this is about you, this is about your life, this is about your government.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Prime minister David Cameron faced growing calls for the UK to reform the offshore tax havens operating on its own Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories, as Britain hosted an Anti-Corruption Summit earlier this month. 11 most corrupt countries in world  
&gt;  
&gt;The UK ranked 10th in Transparency International‚Äôs Corruption Perceptions Index 2015, which measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption worldwide.

2130,"**France is the champion of the post-Covid economic rebound**

France is the European country that has seen activity pick up the fastest, said the consulting firm in a study.


Good news for France: France is the country that has experienced the strongest post-Covid-19 economic rebound, thanks to household consumption, but this surge in activity is at the mercy of an epidemic rebound, reveals a Boston Consulting Group study released Friday. ‚Äú Today, France is the yellow jersey of the rebound. As much as it was the European country which had fallen the most, it is also the one which rises the fastest, ‚Äùanalyzes Sylvain Duranton, world director of BCG GAMMA, the‚Äú data science ‚Äù branch of the firm.

The consulting firm has developed, using artificial intelligence tools, a composite index to measure, in real time, the extent of the recovery ("" recovery gap "") from a pre-crisis level 100 for nine countries, including France, Germany, the United States, Japan and Brazil. As of July 12, France and Germany had a score of 94, very close to the pre-crisis level, followed by Italy (91) and Spain (90), with the United Kingdom at the bottom. trails with a score of 76.

Thus, after falling by 49 points, consumption rebounded in France by 45 points, compared with a fall of 32 followed by a rebound of 27 for Germany, which has not so strictly confined its population. The automotive sector, which had particularly suffered from confinement, is also picking up more in France (95) than in its European neighbors (90 on average), ""in particular thanks to the government stimulus plan "", notes the study.

**Uncertainties about the future**

However, ‚Äú the next two months are going to be a pivotal period for European economies as activity levels are between 90% and 95% of what they were pre-Covid, but we are seeing a small slowdown in the recovery: either we will continue to grow to reach, or even exceed, pre-crisis levels before the end of the year, or on the contrary, with fears of a resumption of the epidemic, of partial containment, we will see these indicators drop ‚Äù , emphasizes Duranton.

If the United States, which has not experienced generalized confinement, has fallen much less (86) than Europe, on the other hand there is no longer any index of recovery in activity and consumption even shows worrying signs of stalling, while Japan finds itself in a situation of complete stagnation. Only China has regained its pre-Covid level of activity: "" in this country, all sectors (...) are growing compared to the same period last year "", notes the BCG study, with the exception of the transport and logistics sector, which depends on the resumption of exports and imports.",,/r/europe/comments/hx5dx9/france_is_the_champion_of_the_postcovid_economic/fz3vqnk/,MendiOndoan,1595609835

2170,"It's definitely one of the more accessible routes. A lot of train travel in the US is even more painfully slow than what's listed on Amtrak's website, because of getting delayed behind freight trains and just general delays. 

But by comparison, if I wanted to travel from my city to say, Portland, Oregon, I've got some options. 

By plane: I can drive 2 hours to either KC or St Louis and take a relatively short 4 hour flight. 

By car: Little more grueling, as it's a 28 hour drive, but I do get to see some beautiful mountains. 

By train: This is where the real joy is...and literally the only potential positive would be the scenery. By train, I have to drive 2 hours to Kansas City, which is whatever, but then I get on a train and the trip from Kansas City to Portland takes roughly 66 hours...

Going by my measurements on Google Maps, my city to Portland is roughly 1600 miles, all in the same country. On the other hand, a trip of slightly similar physical distances, Stockholm to Barcelona (~1400 miles) takes an estimated 28 hours from this random Rome2Rio website I stumbled on. 

So a lot of rail travel depends where you're going. Frequently if I take the train to Chicago, we'll have to stop for freight trains, since the freight companies own all of the track (theoretically they're supposed to stop and give passenger travel priority...but it sure seems hard to believe that's happening).

Carpet bombing was actually the only way to effectively target factories and infrastructure as well back then and that fact alone put many civilians at risk of dying just as collateral damage.

&gt;If you can't even understand that ""a few cents"" is about the unit prices  and not the total, then you are not arguing in good faith and this  whole discussion is point less. 

If you can't even understand that those ""few cents"" amount to an extremely large sum, I can't help you either. Also it seems too difficult for you to understand that the money you think we should be paying - for no good reason - isn't your money. Now why should we pay that, when it adds no value to the product we purchase and when we can just circumvent it? 

If you have an issue with Ukraine losing out on those transit fees go and ask your country or the many ""concerned"" Eastern European countries to pay it instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Same with your foreign aid argument. I didn't even mentioned foreign  aid. What are you talking about? Those are things you come up with. Now  you blame me for things that you argue about with yourself. 

Is it that difficult for you to follow the discussion? 

&gt;And wow, you paid Ukraine 1.5 billion after they were invaded by their neighbor. Germany pays that to Russia each month for gas.   
&gt;  
&gt;But sure, use the argument of that aid to silence nations when they stand up against you. 

What do you think the 1.5 billion we donated to the Ukraine was? Foreign aid, free money they got from us to help them in their difficult situation. Which clearly wasn't appreciated by their current president and looking at your comments also seem to be an insignificant amount for you. 

It also disproves your claim that we aren't standing by the Ukraine:

&gt;Germany is picking cheap gas over standing by the nation that was literally invaded 

&amp;#x200B;

And I am sure that you are going to conviniently ignore this again: Any country that doesn't want this project and is concerned about Russia using gas to exert political pressure on them is free to use the available alternatives (like US LNG).

2234,"BERLIN - German MP Florian Toncar, a prominent figure within the liberal FDP party, calls on Mark Rutte to give a German ribbon.


Rutte deserves the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, called Bundesverdienstkreuz in Germany, for his efforts to keep the European Union's debt mountain manageable, says Toncar, a lawyer and Member of Parliament on behalf of the liberal FDP.

That relatively small party ruled together with CDU / CSU between 2009 and 2013, was punished in the elections afterwards and did not reach the election threshold, but returned in 2017. The FDP is now in opposition.

Rutte is loved in Germany. ""Is the Dutch Prime Minister a German folk hero?"" The BILD newspaper now wonders, following Toncar's idea. ""While the German government is currently missing every European political direction, the Bundesverdienstkreuz would be the only right signal for Rutte,"" said Toncar.

Debts
Rutte has worked hard in Europe for corona support to southern countries in the form of loans, and not just gifts. He is regarded as the leader of the ""economical four"", which includes the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Austria.

If the civilian housing of Hamburg was a valid target, so were the Twin Towers.

Murdering thousands of additional German civilians did not make the war one day shorter, it merely added to the pile of corpses.

&gt; An important point is that for a long time, the bombing campaign was the only way Britain could take the fight to Germany rather than playing defense.

Except for the North African theater, which had been won by this time, and the invasion of Italy, which was already underway.

2384,"&gt;the part they didn't point out is that after that long, racism didn't just go away because it became illegal or abolished. It just went into normalised society.

I would argue that ""racism"" (by which I mean the recognition of other groups of people as being different based on their physical characteristics) is an innate part of the human condition. This is something that has always existed and always will exist, and all we can do is try to mitigate its effects.

On the other hand, *racial hatred* (which is what you appear to be talking about) is something that only exists in very particular circumstances. Where it exists, we must ask why it exists. The coronavirus being weaponised against Asian people I would argue is the result of a concerted propaganda campaign by the west to demonise China and to encourage sanctions or even a possible war. People are being taught to hate Chinese people because China is an emerging superpower and the US (which holds a lot of power over Britain via cultural osmosis) is terrified of having competition.

As for Meghan Markle, I don't buy the idea that people don't like her because she is mixed-race. It's more likely that she is disliked because of her outspoken liberal values, something that isn't going to mesh well with the kind of people who actively care about the monarchy (i.e, the kind of people who read the Daily Mail and have more conservative social views than the rest of the population).

Regarding the ghetto story, there is a lot more to it than that. Some TCs were obviously forced into enclaves because of violence directed against them, but a lot were encouraged to do so by their leaders. There was a movement by TC leaders from the 50s to break cultural and economic bonds between the 2 communities. Greek language was suppressed in Greek speaking Muslim villages and trade was discouraged between the 2 communities. Money was to be spent only in TC businesses and they even discouraged using GC doctors if it was possible. The economic isolation measures are all confirmed by Denkta≈ü in a 1980s interview. TC family friends of ours were also encourage to go to the ghettos/enclaves and refused to do so. Obviously, in certain areas of the island TCs were persecuted and were left with no choice but to leave. My point is that TMT and some members of the TC leadership saw the segregation as beneficial and wanted to promote it as much as possible.

After that, he is supposed to have called other friends, who joined in the group rape, which lasted over several hours \[15\].

More recent sources based on the court procedure, report witness statements by the friend (female) of the victim, according to which the victim and she (the friend), bought and consumed the extacy pills voluntarily.\[16\].

After the act, the victim missed an arm watch, which (according to the court case) was stolen during the act. \[17\].

After the act, the victim  and her friend went with one of the perpetrators, Muhanad M to his refugee home, and spent the night there. The friend was unable to explain this behavior of the rape victim in sufficient fashion. \[16\].

One of the accused perpetrators Timo P. stated that the suppose victim explictily demanded sex, while being under influence of narcotics \[18\].

This specific person who surely have existed and is not just another sad story engineered to elicit positive feelings for the Germans of that period while turning the attention away from the real undisputed victims. But even if she did, and that story played out exactly like she told it after the war &gt;!(which never happened, so many nazis lied their way out of resposibility)!&lt; it is still offensive to present such stories without context. After all, repetition legitimises. There are people today who would say that every country population suffered in comparable ways during WW2, which is an indicator that the whitewashing it working.

It's a problem with democracy at its core. Wealthy democracies inevitably end up favoring the wealthy businesses and individuals who are willing to spend money swaying officials and policies. Unfortunately, our Supreme Court has consistently upheld that corporations are legal persons under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, so we legally can't deny them political rights.

2517,"&gt; Not all jobs require you to speak the local language fluently 

Most jobs *do* though - realistically what proportion of the labour market do you think you are going to access in France without speaking French, or in Germany without speaking German and in the UK without speaking English? In customer-facing and higher-skilled positions, proficiency in the local language is likely even more essential and the exceptions to this (generally international industries like software, finance etc.) tend not to employ a majority of people.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Both my dentist and my GP are from Eastern Europe and they speak Dutch just fine 

Yes but they are a minority of their demographic. Most people from Eastern Europe are neither dentists nor GPs and even amongst those who are, most are not going to become fluent in Dutch unless it just so happens to be their second language.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And the pay differences within countries are way smaller than within the EU as a whole, say between Bulgaria and the Netherlands. 

The differences in cost of living between the 2 countries are also similarly large though.  A Bulgarian couple living with one set of parents in Plovdiv who provides free childcare and maintains their house for free too (which happens to be owned outright without a mortgage) has far lower costs than one who has moved to the Randstad, has to pay market-rate rent *and* fund childcare too. The demographic groups who are more mobile tend to be those who are young and who don't have children. Most people in Europe are not particularly young and thus not particularly internationally mobile. Most people in Bulgaria are fully aware that they would be paid more in the Netherlands - but *despite* this, most Bulgarians still live in Bulgaria.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; how delusional do you have to be to think a doctor in Sudan [would stay there if he makes a couple of hundred euros a month](http://www.salaryexplorer.com/salary-survey.php?loc=205&amp;loctype=1&amp;job=13&amp;jobtype=2) when in the west they can make thousands if not tens of thousands. 

Most people in Sudan (or in fact, anywhere) are not doctors though, are they? You've picked a niche profession which is in demand globally to make your point. Bear in mind that the prospective migrant has initial sunk costs *before* he/she can make a return on migration too - for example, in this case, the doctor has to pay out of his/her own pocket: i) a flight to the developed world not only for him/herself but potentially also for his/her spouse and children, ii) upfront rent on a place to live, iii) medical fees, iv) potentially further education if existing Sudanese qualifications are not recognized, v)  childcare costs if both parents are working, etc. The time required to save up for these costs may be equivalent to *multiple years* of work in Sudan.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Why would anyone stay in the developing world? Open borders is a pipe dream. 

Err - because people quite like where they live and grew up, and value their existing social networks, friends and family? Because not everyone is motivated by the opportunity to earn more money, and even those who are, generally often only wish to move *temporarily* until they feel they've saved enough to return home? Because most people do not want the hassle of having to learn a new language, attempt to develop a new vriendekring, etc. And even those who wish to leave may find that the costs of living in their preferred destination mean it is not worth it to move *permanently*. Only 3.3% of EU nationals live outside their nation of citizenship *despite* there being free movement across the Union, and *despite* the often big differentials in salaries between member states.

For example. there are *huge* numbers of foreigners in the United Arab Emirates thanks to the availability of many jobs and no taxes on income, however the overwhelming majority have no intention of learning Arabic to a fluent level and retiring there. Most will likely return to their home countries within a decade of arriving. Likewise, there's an open border between Gibraltar and Spain, but despite this there aren't huge numbers of Spaniards descending on Gibraltar. Similarly with Singapore - there's huge numbers of cheap flights between Vietnam and Singapore, and the latter is far wealthier than the former. *Despite* this, Vietnam has hardly been depopulated and Singapore is not overflowing with Vietnamese people.

2568,"&gt;Evil but effective logic: If we kill the civilian populace, they'll create less soldiers.

It wasn't about creating fewer soldiers, it was aimed at creating fewer weapons.

Before the bombings in July 1943 634,000 people worked in war industries in Hamburg. 3 months after the bombings the figure was down to 331,000. Most German men remained in work, but more than 50% of German women and more than 60% of foreigners left the city and a large proportion didn't return. Production slowly recovered and reached 80% of the previous level, but never recovered completely. And that was despite continuous growth in production before the bombs, and in unbombed areas afterwards.

According to the British and American bombing surveys, a total of 1.8 months of production from the city was lost. That included between 20 and 26 submarines.

The Luftwaffe pioneered area bombing of British cities. Britain, which suffered first the Luftwaffe daylight campaign, then the Blitz, found the Blitz to be more damaging and adopted the same tactics themselves. The Americans, who came to Europe convinced of the superiority of their precision bombing techniques, adopted radar aiming devices in September 1943 and began carrying out area bombing attacks on German cities, and by the end of the war in Japan had switched almost entirely to area bombing.

The logic of area bombing cities was that, because bombing was inaccurate, it was the most effective way to hurt the enemy. The firestorm raid on Hamburg was the most effective raid in Europe. However, the bombs actually missed their aiming point by miles. Because the target was the city, rather than an individual factory, that didn't matter, and even a miss of several miles did tremendous damage.",,/r/europe/comments/hwvv2i/in_1943_operation_gomorrah_began_british_and/fz2nfym/,WhiteSatanicMills,1595581149

2571,"43% of the voters were completely safe as they spoke FOR Hitler. The overwhelming majority of the rest completely fine with it as long as Germany was winning. Socialists were killed, but everyone else was fine with that.

Here's an excerpt:

&gt;**There are indicators that Hitler‚Äôs popularity peaked in 1939 at somewhere close to 80, or 90% just before the war and fell well below 50% as the war progressed.**  
&gt;  
&gt;At Machtergreifung (Nazi seizure of power) in 1933 Hitler was already very popular - despite the Nazis, not being in majority by themselves, a vast majority agreed to transfer dictatorial powers to him in what could loosely be called the last ‚Äòfree‚Äô referendum.  
&gt;  
&gt;After that it declined somewhat, but in 1938 and 1939 his popularity rose steadily through bravado actions, such as the Anschluss of Austria and the annexation of the Sudetenland.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, the decrease in popularity was swift and came more, or less directly in September 1939 with the invasion of Poland. Even early ‚Äúsuccesses‚Äù in Poland and France did not help the fact that people in general did not want another war.

Hundreds of Turkish citizens gathered outside the Greek consulate in the city of Izmir on Thursday to express their solidarity with the Greek people following the devastating wildfires and the heavy death toll.




Simple people and members of trade unions held banners reading ‚ÄúHold On, Neighbors!‚Äù

Some were holding a banner  that expressed the Greek support to Turkey after the devastating earthquake in August 1999.

Messages of support for Greece from Turkey flooded the social media from the very first day of the wildfires. And not Only.



Relations between the two neighboring countries are often soured due to an aggresive Turkish foreign policy. Nationalists on both sides swear at each other on media, blogs, websites and of course, social media.




But disasters unite and bring people together. So did the earthquakes in 1999, when a devastating earthquake hit Turkey in August, and another one stroke Greece a month later. At that time, Greek-Turkish relations were at the bottom.




President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called both his Greek counterpart Prokopis Pavlopoulos and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to express his condolence for the victims of the fires.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/hwx309/on_this_day_2_years_ago_attica_wildfires_turkish/fz2fmdq/,anon58588,1595573647

The love goes deeper than that. They had russian support before the Kosovo issue. Serbia is both dependent and friends with Russia.

The ruling party are populists, the state media network is a propoganda machine. They've brainwashed grandmas who do nothing but watch the channel. They've basically bought the votes of low income families with populist social programs. 

Catholicism is big in Poland and they have the bishops and priests in their pockets who churn out their propoganda for them and mobilize them to vote.

The opposition on the other hand are crooks who when in power stole pensions so they left a sour taste in the mouths of many.  Many vote against or just don't vote at all. 

Regardless, the opposition won in western Poland and in big cities. The current president won in bodunk villages and eastern Poland.

It is true that Serbia is still grateful for Russia's help in WWI (and previously against the Ottoman empire).

That's why Tito started the non-aligned movement in the first place.

Serbia is slowly changing as we speak. The younger generation tends to have less of the nostalgies of the old. I doubt that Serbia is all that dependent on Russia. Rather it tries to pursue its own national interest as it should.

Another story is that the US is putting pressure on the Greek government to buy US ships. Apparently, they want to sell you second-hand DDG-51s which I would personally not buy (these are twice the size of the French ships. Crew complement is 300 peoples). Both these scenarios may be true. Personally I hope the French change their strategy.

As for the corvettes, they leave me a bit sceptical. The announced range especially (5000nmi) seems way too high for a 800t ship. On the other hand, that may be due to the very low speed at which it is announced. In any case, wait and see. As far as I know, it is for now a simple proposal from a shipyard.

3022,"The OP did write it correctly because the word ""ancient"" in English is not used the same way as ""antichnyi"" is in Russian, it can simply be a synonym for ""oldest"". In Russian we would most probably say ""–æ–¥–∏–Ω –∏–∑ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–µ–π—à–∏—Ö/—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–µ–π—à–∏—Ö –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏"" (odin iz drevnyeyshih/staryeyshih gorodov Rossii), but never ""odin iz (samyh) antichnyh gorodov Rossii"".

To me as a native Russian speaker, and I assume you are a native speaker too, ""drevniy"" can actually mean far older than ""antichnyi"". The latter mainly refers to classical antiquity and cannot be used to refer to any other civilisation besides ancient Greece and ancient Rome, but it can also mean ""classical"" or ""beautiful/correct in a classical Greek/Roman way"". So a ""drevnyaya tsivilizatsiya"" (ancient/primordial civilisation) could easily mean a civilisation that existed tens of thousands of years ago. ""Drevniy"" (ancient/extremely old) is older than ""staryi"" (old).  ""Starinnyi"" (old-fashioned/ancient) can sometimes be used as a synonym of ""drevniy"" (ancient), but in most cases if we want to say that something is super ancient, then ""drevniy"" would be used instead of ""starinnyi"" e.g. ""drevniy mir"" means ""ancient world"" and can easily refer to the time when dinosaurs existed, but it can also mean the world of ancient Romans. Using ""starinnyi"" would be incorrect here, but you could use ""antichnyi mir"" when referring to the time when ancient Romans lived. It is way more confusing in Russian than it is in English.

Just take a look at the following: we almost always say ""Drevniy Rim"" (ancient Rome), ""Drevnyaya Gretsiya"" (ancient Greece) and ""Drevniy Egipet"" (ancient Egypt) instead of ""Antichnyi Rim/Egipet"" or ""Antichnaya Gretsiya"", but we refer to that period as ""antichnost'"" (antiquity) instead of ""drevnost'"".",,/r/europe/comments/hwc92r/pskov_turns_903_years_old_today_it_is_one_of/fz15j40/,Iluov2018,1595545085

The only reason the conservative employee might have to think an agenda is being pushed by his employer onto them is because the employer holds economic hegemony over him. That is capitalism in the most essential of nutshells.

I assure you that if the policy was not pushed by management but by an independent group of employees, the conservative employee would be more than happy to work with management to shut it down. Direct action is the lifeblood of social progress and the tension between the two groups is essential to create a path forward that ensures space for the two of them. We can refer to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's words:

&gt; I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

https://time.com/5564207/russia-nato-relationship/

&gt; So why isn‚Äôt Russia a member of NATO?
&gt;
&gt;Despite Russia signaling its interest to join NATO, there has since been a lot of tension between them. ‚ÄúOnce Russia can show it is upholding democracy and human rights, NATO can seriously consider its membership,‚Äùsays Rasmussen, the former Danish Prime Minister who served as NATO Secretary General from 2009 to 2014. In the meantime, he adds ‚Äúwe tried to build strong cooperation with Moscow.‚Äù He cites the 2002 Russia-NATO council, a development of the 1997 Act, which serves as a mechanism for cooperation, consensus building and joint-decision making. ‚ÄúWe do share common interests. We cooperated on counter terrorism in Afghanistan, counter narcotics and counter piracy,‚Äù says Rasmussen. 
&gt;
&gt; But Russia has repeatedly made a request that NATO has rejected: to refuse to accept new members in its ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù (or neighboring countries), says Rasmussen. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt for the West or Moscow to decide whether those countries should join NATO. Each and every country has the right to decide its alliance and affiliation,‚Äù says the former NATO ambassador Garcevic.

Russia's requirement for joining NATO was that the states that it considered within its sphere of influence could not themselves join NATO.

NATO membership prevents use of Russia's military against those states.

That is, Russia would ally *if* Russia continued to have the ability to utilize hard power against states in the Eastern Bloc, which would permit Russia to have that hard power lever over them.

3281,"&gt;25 Swedish doctors and scientists Opinion contributors Sweden has often been considered a leader when it comes to global humanitarian issues, regarded as a beacon of light in areas such as accepting refugees and working against global warming. In the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden has also created interest around the world by following its own path of using a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù approach ‚Äî not locking down, introducing mostly voluntary restrictions and spurning the use of masks.  
&gt;  
&gt;This approach has been perceived as more liberal and has shown up in ‚ÄúBe Like Sweden‚Äù signs and chants at U.S. protests. Wherever measures have been lenient, though, death rates have peaked. In the United States, areas that are coming out of lockdown early are suffering, and we are seeing the same in other countries as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;The motives for the Swedish Public Health Agency's light-touch approach are somewhat of a mystery. Some other countries that initially used this strategy swiftly abandoned it as the death toll began to increase, opting instead for delayed lockdowns. But Sweden has been faithful to its approach.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why? Gaining herd immunity, where large numbers of the population (preferably younger) are infected and thereby develop immunity, has not been an official goal of the Swedish Public Health Agency. But it has said immunity in the population could help suppress the spread of the disease, and some agency statements suggest it is the secret goal. An unnerving death rate  
&gt;  
&gt;Further evidence of this is that the agency insists on mandatory schooling for young children, the importance of testing has been played down for a long time, the agency refused to acknowledge the importance of asymptomatic spread of the virus (concerningly, it has encouraged those in households with COVID-19 infected individuals to go to work and school) and still refuses to recommend masks in public, despite the overwhelming evidence of their effectiveness. In addition, the stated goal of the Swedish authorities was always not to minimize the epidemic, but rather slow it down, so that the health care system wouldn‚Äôt be overwhelmed. People outside a restaurant without masks or social distancing on July 17, 2020 in Gotland, Sweden. Martin von Krogh/Getty Images  
&gt;  
&gt;Several authorities, including the World Health Organization, have condemned herd immunity as a strategy. ""It can lead to a very brutal arithmetic that does not put people and life and suffering at the center of that equation,‚Äù Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, said at a press conference in May.  
&gt;  
&gt;With COVID-19, don‚Äôt only focus on death: Too many Americans are alive and in misery.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regardless of whether herd immunity is a goal or a side effect of the Swedish strategy, how has it worked out? Not so well, according to the agency‚Äôs own test results. The proportion of Swedes carrying antibodies is estimated to be under 10%, thus nowhere near herd immunity. And yet, the Swedish death rate is unnerving. Sweden has a death toll greater than the United States: 556 deaths per million inhabitants, compared with 425, as of July 20.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sweden also has a death toll more than four and a half times greater than that of the other four Nordic countries combined ‚Äî more than seven times greater per million inhabitants. For a number of weeks, Sweden has been among the top in the world when it comes to current reported deaths per capita. And despite this, the strategy in essence remains the same. Learn from Sweden's mistakes  
&gt;  
&gt;It is possible that the Public Health Authority actually believed that the Swedish approach was the most appropriate and sustainable one, and that the other countries, many of which went into lockdown, would do worse. Perhaps this, and not herd immunity, is the main reason the authorities are desperately clinging to their strategy. Or perhaps an unwillingness to admit early mistakes and take responsibility for thousands of unnecessary deaths plays into this resistance to change. Nevertheless, the result at this stage is unequivocal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Adopting the Swedish model: Coronavirus doesn't care about public opinion and it still kills  
&gt;  
&gt;We do believe Sweden can be used as a model, but not in the way it was thought of initially. It can instead serve as a control group and answer the question of how efficient the voluntary distancing and loose measures in Sweden are compared to lockdowns, aggressive testing, tracing and the use of masks.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Sweden, the strategy has led to death, grief and suffering and on top of that there are no indications that the Swedish economy has fared better than in many other countries. At the moment, we have set an example for the rest of the world on how not to deal with a deadly infectious disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end, this too shall pass and life will eventually return to normal. New medical treatments will come and improve the prognosis. Hopefully there will be a vaccine. Stick it out until then. And don‚Äôt do it the Swedish way.

3344,"&gt;and the fact that Russia was the first to mobilize and sought to gain influence in the balkans.

Russia viewed itself as a guarantor of the slavic people, this includes serbia, it would be seen as a weakness if the government didn't come to serbias aid and could have led to a revolution, russia HAD to defend serbia.

besides mobilizing isn't the same as starting a war and it is ridiculous to suggest a country isn't allowed to mobilize once war seems to be a distinct possibility.

&gt;""If x country hadn't done x leading up to the war"" could be said for all of them.

Germany and Austria both wanted the war and fundamentally they where the ones to start the war, the Austrian ultimatum was largely at the time seen as unreasonable even by the Germans yet they still didn't protest Austria preparing an attack on a small independent country.

&gt;it's the common historical consensus that the blame of the world war can be placed on every one of the imperialistic nations

3346,"Michel Barnier has said a post-Brexit trade deal is ""unlikely"" unless the UK is willing to cede to Brussels' demands on fishing and the ""level playing field"" guarantees the EU says are needed to prevent unfair competition.

""This week again the UK did not show a willingness to break the deadlock,"" Mr Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said after talks ended in London. ""But the EU cannot accept and will not accept the bill for the UK's political choices.
""By its current refusal to commit to open and fair competition and a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely.""

Both sides have long been divided on those two issues, as well as the future role of the European Court of Justice in policing any future relationship agreement.
When asked whether he believed the UK was trying to run down the clock in the hope of securing a better deal, Mr Barnier said: ""I don't believe in such a method in such a complex negotiation process... it's an issue that is too serious.""

The UK rejects the ""level playing field"" guarantees because it argues they are stricter than those in other EU trade deals and could restrict its ability to diverge from Brussels' rules. 
It wants separate agreements rather than a single one, and a Norway-style fishing agreement with annual negotiations.

Failure to agree a trade deal before the end of the transition period will mean both sides trading on less lucrative WTO terms and with tariffs, rather than the zero-tariff agreement both want.
""Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called 'level playing field' and on fisheries,"" said the chief UK negotiator David Frost. 

""We have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period.
""Despite all the difficulties, on the basis of the work we have done in July my assessment is that agreement can still be reached in September and that we should continue to negotiate with this aim in mind.""
Boris Johnson had urged Brussels to put a ""tiger in the tank"" of the negotiations when both sides agreed to a schedule of intensified talks during July.

Formal negotiations will continue in Brussels in the middle of August, although Mr Barnier said informal talks would go on until both sides meet again. The EU wants the agreement to be finalised by October so there is time to ratify it before the end of the year.

It was the fourth physical meeting between both negotiating teams since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic saw the talks move online.",,/r/europe/comments/hwjdbs/uk_is_making_postbrexit_trade_deal_unlikely/fyzwhl5/,casualphilosopher1,1595523667

3465,"&gt;Clark is guilty of his ideology (whitewashing Imperial Germany and its royals) seeping into his works, but you're OK with that since it seems to fit into your own ideology

This is a highly speculative comment, as to whether his faulty analysis of the Hohenzollern family was on purpose or just a mistake. I would stand with you on the issue of Hohenzollern connections to the Nazi party though. Even if my BFF Clark was wrong! ;)

&gt;And ""ideologues"" are identified by you as ""people who you disagree with""

Nah. I think things are ideological when not primarily based/argued on sources. I do highly recommend you read the article I linked to you earlier. I think it displays exactly what I would define as ideological.

It displayed that you can ( or could;  this might have changed) get a Gender Studies article published, as long as you submit to vague sentiments and statements within the group. The authors never argued any of their points!

See (aanschouw):

&gt;Inasmuch as masculinity is essentially performative, so too is the conceptual penis. The penis, in the words of Judith Butler, ‚Äúcan only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility‚Äù (Butler, 1993). The penis should not be understood as an honest expression of the performer‚Äôs intent should it be presented in a performance of masculinity or hypermasculinity. Thus, the isomorphism between the conceptual penis and what‚Äôs referred to throughout discursive feminist literature as ‚Äútoxic hypermasculinity,‚Äù is one defined upon a vector of male cultural *machismo braggadocio*, with the conceptual penis playing the roles of subject, object, and verb of action. The result of this trichotomy of roles is to place hypermasculine men both within and outside of competing discourses whose dynamics, as seen via post-structuralist discourse analysis, enact a systematic interplay of power in which hypermasculine men use the conceptual penis to move themselves from powerless subject positions to powerful ones (*confer*: Foucault, 1972).  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;  No one knows what any of this means because it is complete nonsense. Anyone claiming to is pretending. Full stop.  
&gt;  
&gt;It gets worse. Not only is the text ridiculous, so are the references. Most of our references are quotations from papers and figures in the field that barely make sense in the context of the text. Others were obtained by searching keywords and grabbing papers that sounded plausibly connected to words we cited. We read exactly zero of the sources we cited, by intention, as part of the hoax. And it gets still worse‚Ä¶

That is a very small, select group you are referring to.I'm talking migrants in general. So yes, it's not surprising that illegal immigrants don't have jobs, it;s illegal to employ them.

Asylum seekers can legally be employed during their procedure, we see that 20% are employed within one year.

So we keep running in circles: illegal migration makes it impossible for them to get employed and leads to them being a burden on our social system. You have 2 options: tackle the ""illegal"" part or tackle the ""migration"" part.

As long as there is a ""push"" factor (war, hunger, poverty,...), you will not be able to stop migration. People will literally paddle in a shitty boat across an open sea to get here.

3530,"&gt; These statics look at the reported rapes and not actual rapes. Simply taking this data at face value may not be the best thing to do. For example, a quick glance at the list shows that United Arab Emirates (a country that does not criminalizes marital* rap) only reported 72 (!) incidents in 2020. Does that sound reasonable to you?  
  
In terms of reported rapes, yes. We will take that data at face value as that's the best way to compare reported cases among countries. I have already touched on the problem of underreported cases in a follow up post and underreported cases are just as big a problem in the West as it is in the East and elsewhere, especially in the case of ""date rapes"" or ""marital rapes"". Turkey doesn't stand out in this alone.  
  
In fact, not in many countries the random female homicides or sexual crimes are as much publicized as they are in Turkey as Turkish public is disturbed by such occurences and demand something done about it. I lived in New York, Boston, Los Angeles and been to London a couple of times and Paris once. All of those cities are much unsafer than Istanbul, for instance, when it comes to female safety from domestic violence, rape, sexual assault or female homicide. Some of them are very dangerous for females to be outside alone at night. When you look at reported sex assault or domestic violence cases, those cities are worse and all of them also suffer unreported cases.  
  
There's a global problem of violence and exploitation, females get their share from this everywhere, even more so in ""developed countries"" in some cases.

The k usually refers to thousands here, too. The usage of k to denote a thousand stems from the greek ""kilo"", which means ""thousand"". In more formal settings you would not see it written, however (neither in the US, though, I believe). It is not at all weird for europeans to use it since we are used to the kilo e.g. in weight (kilo-gram = 1000 gram, kilo-metre = 1000 meters).

He has been keeping his position by giving city's money to improve neighborhoods and commumities (retired people, gypises ect..) tp vote for him. On a note, party already had a candidate who also won ( Ivo Josipoviƒá). He got out or was thrown out and started his own political party BM365- Stranka rada i solidarnosti. After that story goes even crazier, he manages to enter the parliament with only few seats and manages to collect some obscure parliament members, who left SDP and some other parties, played a key role for HDZ to keep their constitutional majority in the parliament (they were relative winners not absolute), and in return HDZ kept his majority in Zagreb's city assembly.

3612,"&gt;That's just virtue signalling (and doesn't explain male on male violence, or violence/sex crimes against women in so called ""developed countries"" with such teaching and high education level).

To be honest, I'm not sure what you are trying to say with this comment.

&gt;When we look at [rape statistics per country](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/rape-statistics-by-country), for example, we see countries like France, United States, Sweden, Australia, Belgium, New Zealand, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Luxembourg, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Monaco, Spain, Russia, Poland, Cyprus, Greece, even Israel with higher rape rates than Turkey.

These statics look at the reported rapes and not actual rapes. Simply taking this data at face value may not be the best thing to do. For example,  a quick glance at the list shows that United Arab Emirates (a country that does not criminalizes marital\* rape) only reported 72 (!) incidents in 2020. Does that sound reasonable to you?

&gt;Sex trafficking and domestic violence are also prevalent in all types of countries regardless of education level, income level, religion and culture.

There are number of studies which indicate that income inequality plays a role in violent crime.  [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178916302105](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178916302105)

3636,"I still claim that ""Turkiye"", while used to designate the state at some documents, has never been the official name of the Ottoman state. And you offered no counter argument except to show that it was indeed used to designate the state at times. Ottoman state had a constitution, it never defined the state as ""Turkiye"".

It wasn't a ""legal loophole"", the fact that Turkey is not the successor state of the Ottoman empire is nit a legal loophole but a political statement. Brits very well had the capacity to fight still, as seen in Musul-Kerkuk issue where they again flexed their military muscles. Turkey also paid 65% of that debt that was divided between ex-Ottiman nations, and others paid the rest. The debts were all paid to the last penny, Britain and France didn't renounce anything.

In the capitulations issue, Turkey again diplomatically presented the argument that it was indeed not the successor of the Ottoman state while allied powers tried to press the opposite. Turkey also renounced all claims outside Misak-i Milli which again pointed to the fact that this was a different state with a different territorial makeup. To convince and press the claim of separation, Turkey didn't use any legal loopholes but its military victories on the ground. But this is where the arguments came from.

The Ottoman state being under British influence or many Ottoman officials defecting to the Ankara government doesn't mean it didn't exist. There was a separate, independent (from Ankara, not allied powers) Ottoman government in Istanbul. This government, with its head the Padisah and other officials joined the independence war on the British side. It wasn't a ""rogue clique"", it was the internationally recognized Ottoman government. The Ankara government was the rogue clique which became an independent separate political entity when they opened TBMM. The Ottoman government being publicly illegitimate, having tons of defections, being British puppets etc. has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that they were the recognized government of the Ottoman empire, a different political entity than the Ankara government that officially the war against it. The military they had all defected to Ankara so they couldn't actually fight, but that doesn't change much. If they actually had a loyal army, what their orders for them were were obvious.

3655,"This can be compared to the moment Hamilton partly mutualized the US states debt incurred in the war of Independance.  

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It was instantly deemed ‚Äú[historic](https://www.ft.com/content/cd0fc1ed-b971-4159-a63c-5c3cf8470aaf)‚Äù ‚Äì stylized a ‚Äú[Hamiltonian moment](https://www.ft.com/content/2735a3f1-bc58-477c-9315-c98129d12852)‚Äù ‚Äì but this may be a somewhat obscure allusion for many Europeans. The reference is to Alexander Hamilton (1755-1804), the first American Secretary of the Treasury, who famously engineered a deal with his fractious contemporaries to allow the new government of the United States to assume the individual war-time debts of the former colonies, and convert them to joint obligations of the federal union. This has been seen by historians as one of the decisive steps towards the creation of the American system of government.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;The arguments pro and con in Hamilton‚Äôs time were similar to the debates taking place in Europe today.¬†The opposition was strong. Virginia (the largest and wealthiest state of the original 13) played the part of Germany. Virginians were prudent, and self-serving. They had already paid off their debts, and were loathe to accept responsibility for bailing out their feckless colleagues in states like Massachusetts. Hamilton offered a range of arguments in favor of the debt assumption, all aimed at strengthening the federal power, cementing the common interest of the states in a more stable and viable constitutional framework. But the situation was permeated with self-interest, cloaked in what we would now call the fear of ‚Äúmoral hazard.‚Äù   
&gt;  
&gt; A Congressman from Georgia put it [thus](https://www.americanheritage.com/founding-wizard#6):  
&gt;  
&gt;*My soul rises indignant‚Ä¶ Where, I again demand, is the justice of compelling a State which has taxed her citizens for the sinking of her debt, to pay another proportion, not of her own, but the debts of other States, which have made no exertions whatever?*  
&gt;  
&gt;And so, Hamilton‚Äôs proposal was voted down in the House of Representatives ‚Äì¬†31 to 29. The debt-assumption issue was seen as the ‚Äú[millstone about the neck of the whole system which must finally sink it.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765805510/ref=rdr_ext_tmb)‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Hamilton persisted. The matter was eventually resolved, as per historical legend, at a private dinner of the three great founders ‚Äì¬†Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison ‚Äì¬†meeting alone, in New York City. A deal was struck to convert Virginia‚Äôs opposition into support, crucial for the measure‚Äôs approval.   
&gt;  
&gt;(...)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Hamilton is often quoted as having said that ‚Äúa national debt will be a national blessing‚Äù ‚Äì a striking phrase, and one that got him into considerable trouble with his contemporaries. How can debt be a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù? Not a ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù or a ‚Äúprice to pay‚Äù but a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù? That was ‚Äì and is ‚Äì hard to swallow.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Hamilton evidently did once write those words in a letter, but it is not exactly what he meant. The ‚Äúblessing,‚Äù as he saw it, was not the debt, but¬†the ‚Äúproper *funding* of the debt‚Äù \[Hamilton‚Äôs emphasis\].¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;(...)  
&gt;  
&gt;Financial markets are social arrangements built on faith, experience, and expectations. Investors, issuers, and all market participants gradually develop confidence in one another, and in ‚Äúthe system‚Äù ‚Äî and the process becomes self-reinforcing. This is what ‚Äúcredit‚Äù itself consists of. Today, the market for US Treasurys is the deepest and most liquid financial market in the world, which is why our economic competitors, and even our adversaries, are willing to hold our debt. Treasurys are truly the gold standard ‚Äì even more than gold itself. It is this imperial debt which supports the Federal Reserve. It is this blessed debt which supports the role of the dollar as the world‚Äôs reserve currency. This vast advantage is the basis of American financial hegemony, and the fragmentation and stuntedness of the Eurozone‚Äôs debt market are the roots of its weaknesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;A unified debt market backed by the full power ‚Äì¬†the ‚Äúfull faith and credit‚Äù ‚Äì¬†of the European economic union: this is the prospect that lies just around the next corner for the Eurozone. The baby steps that Merkel and Macron proposed last week (and ‚Ç¨500 Bn is just a baby step)¬†will take time to catch on, but if European policy-makers follow the path, one could imagine in 5 or 10 years a market for Eurobonds (or whatever euphemism ends up being attached to that instrument) that would rival the Treasury bond market. And we‚Äôll all be better off for it, because it will underpin stability of the larger union (as Hamilton foresaw for the U.S.). Of course there were 230 years of ups and downs for America to reach this stage. But it all rested on Hamilton‚Äôs ‚Äúdinner bargain‚Äù with the Virginians.

But we've been talking about Bulgaria, which is about same size as Belarus, just a bit smaller. I'm using USA and Australia as example of right mental approach. If colonists were sitting and waiting for State to build infrastructure they would die before it's built.

I've lost illusions and trust in our State's ability to create something good for people long time ago. Recently was story about infrastructure. Several new multistory houses were built in Minsk with not enough parking spots. People coming to use near businesses were using house parking a lot, so citizens living in house decided to install gate barrier like on rail-road opening for those who have electronic key only. They collected all necessarily documents and went to the State, were rejected twice, but finally got approval, after that invested their own $12000 and build that barrier and marked about 40 parking spots for 2-3 houses, 200-300 flats total. That caused drama from nearby houses, who were left with only few parking spots for them and to deal with outsiders taking them, plus pure jealousy. They went bitching to State to and got previous decision to install barrier cancelled. Fuck State, they caused the problem in first place by not enforcing more parking spots into project then after people started solving it themselves they pissed off just everybody, people invested money in fixing problem State created, now they won't get it back.

I doubt State is much better in Bulgaria, otherwise we wouldn't be reading articles like that here.",Belarus,/r/europe/comments/hvuoi3/as_eastern_europe_shrinks_rural_bulgaria_is/fyyw6q6/,bolsheada,1595502278

Edit: For those who are downvoting, either due to misunderstanding my comment or poor understanding of history, the common historical consensus is that ww1 can not be attributed to any one state. Bellicose warmongering were found amongst most empires, whether it was French revanchism towards Germany, Brits with the Thucydides trap wanting to shut Germany down as their industrial capabilities now that they were united usurped the balance of power in Europe, exacerbated by Willies Weltpolitik, Russians with their pan-slavic ambitions who sought to achieve influence in the balkans and were directly at odds with austrians, being the one to mobilize against Austria-Hungary after their retribution towards Serbia.  

One argument by the historically illiterate in response to this is that it was Germany who made it into a world war instead of a local balkan one by declaring war on France, but this ignores the pretty simply fact that France and the UK were never going to sit twiddling thumbs idly as the war went on for Russia, they mobilized before Germany declared war because they had the full intention of joining it, and would do so even if Germany hadn't declared first on them.  

So no, please don't tell your local historian or history teacher that Germany or Austria was the one to start ww1, or rather do so, but before any tests, so he can correct you in time before any test comes along and avoid your grade dropping by spreading one of the, sadly, more common historical misconceptions.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/hwajbi/in_1914_austriahungary_issued_a_series_of_demands/fyyo7da/,Eikeskog,1595494384

He stopped the public city deratisation (got a rat, fix it yourself... Your neighbour has one? Nag at him till he fixes it) , stopped regular cleaning of storm drains (mosquitos everywhere and mini floods).
The city centre is dead without tourism.
He wants to close the main historic city market square to build a parking garage there.

Wild new buildings popping up everywhere and modern reinterpretation of historic buildings.

So yes you can't drink from the fountain anymore and most of the fountains stink of chlorine now. All in order to save on lost water.

You need more than a flag and name to claim legal continuity. Everyone is aware of de facto continuity, we're talking about de jure continuity. This was the justification of why Sevres was considered null and void btw., a different political entity signed Lausanne and had no responsibility for Sevres.

So the debts were changed because we had no capaciry to pay? Last time we had no capacity to pay the Brits took Cyprus instead, how nice they forgave and forgot this time! What actually happened was that every country that took land from the Ottoman state shared the debts proportional to km2 of land they acquired from the Ottomans. That included Turkey, and Turkey had an incredibly hard time paying those debts but still managed to do it in the early years of the republic. The way it was divided suggests that Turkey is no more responsible for the debts than Greece, Frenc protectorate of Syria or Saudi Arabia.

Yes, Turkey did fight against the Ottoman state. The Istanbul government waa officially at war with the Ankara government. The fact that their remaining army and most people defected to support the Ankara government doesn't change that. The Istanbul government did join the war of independence, on the colonizers' side.

Well, unlike your state, our ruling circles actually do tend to change from time to time, and essentially our entire society considers Soviet rule to have been an illegal foreign occupation.

&gt;The outcome of the parliamentary elections in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in July 1940 was a natural reaction of the overwhelming majority of voters in these countries, who spoke out in favor of joining the USSR, which was considered the only power capable of resisting Nazi aggression.

Interesting. Because according to your very own rhetoric, we were the most ardent pro-Nazi collaborators just a year later.

&gt;most countries de facto recognized the incorporation of the Baltic republics into the USSR, and some confirmed this de jure in official correspondence.

The Habsburgs were 'loved' because the alternative was very much undesirable. Franz Ferdinand was a man without a heir (that he was forced to have a morganatic marriage should tell you enough about the appetite for reform of the ruling circles) that was very much anti-Hungarian (naturally) and proposed that the ruling elites willingly give up their privileges to the ones they ruled over.

3789,"&gt; Education and modernism will help solving the problem
  
""Education"" won't solve the problem of violence (Nazis were among the most educated people in the world. Some of them later helped establish NASA), not to mention the fact that people like George W Bush are Yale graduates. Education doesn't change personality.  
  
Also Turkey is doing better in female homicide and domestic violence statistics than countries with better education and higher GDP per capita like the US, Russia, India. [source](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.FE.P5)  
  
&gt;Government ignore this huge problem and never take any steps to prevent violence against women.   
   
Not true. Once a woman files charges, courts in Turkey immediately issue protection order as per #6284 and that person is barred from obtaining fire arms license (and their current license and firearms are confiscated by law enforcement if they have any).  
  
Problem is, courts and the police can't provide 24 hour police protection all the time, no country can do that, especially for cases like this last one. Also some of those women contact the perpetrators after the protection order is issued.

3868,"Yeah, but I'd thought that they were even older.

The US has never had lances in its cavalry that I'm aware of.  Like, the US used firearms, maybe swords as a backup.  I'd assumed that US usage had just reflected general usage elsewhere.  So I'd kind of vaguely thought that lances had gone away before the US showed up.

Like, I'd associated lance use with...I dunno, the 1500s?  Conquistadors, the Renaissance.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_cavalry

&gt;Heavy cavalry was a class of cavalry intended to deliver a battlefield charge and also to act as a tactical reserve; they are also often termed 'shock cavalry'.

-

&gt; Armoured cavalry, in the form of the gendarme, was at its highest as a proportion of the total number of combatants in many Renaissance armies, especially in France. Other Western European states also used heavy cavalry very often, such as Spain and the Holy Roman Empire in the Italian Wars.

That's the sort of thing that I was thinking of.  Smash into an organized line of infantry armed with melee weapons with lances and break them.  That once people had firearms everywhere, charging a formation was suicidal.  That cavalry after that point was really for doing things like scouting, cutting supply lines, or exploiting a rout or something, and if you charge, it's not at a formation, and if it's not at a formation, you'd have no reason to use a lance.

But WP says the lance saw a resurgence during the 1800s in Europe, which I was not aware of.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancer

&gt; There was debate over the value of the lance in mounted combat during the 18th century and most armies had few lancer units by the beginning of the 19th century.
&gt;
&gt;However, during the Napoleonic Wars, lancers were to be seen in many of the combatant nations as their value in shock tactics became clear.

-

&gt; By the late 19th century, many cavalry regiments in European and Asian armies were composed of troopers with lances, as primary weapons, in the front rank and horsemen with sabres only in the second: the lances for the initial shock and sabres for the subsequent m√™l√©e that would follow suit. 

*Looks further*

Apparently the [Charge of the Light Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade) was done partly with lances too.

&gt; The Light Brigade were the British light cavalry force. It mounted light, fast horses which were unarmoured. The men were armed with lances and sabres. Optimized for maximum mobility and speed, they were intended for reconnaissance and skirmishing. They were also ideal for cutting down infantry and artillery units as they attempted to retreat.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hvv61c/uniforms_of_various_states_from_ww1_19141918/fyyigv3/,duisThias,1595488483

3910,"he Russia report was supposed to prove once and for all that the Kremlin rigged the EU referendum, Boris Johnson is an FSB asset and Dominic Cummings a bot operated from Saint Petersburg. Anything but the glum reality that the Leave campaign was more effective than its rival. That is not to say Vladimir Putin‚Äôs regime did not attempt to influence the 2016 vote. It is almost inconceivable that it didn‚Äôt, but the government‚Äôs complacent attitude towards democratic security means there was insufficient monitoring to know for certain.

Ministers and intelligence agencies should have been alive to the threat of Russian interference because, as the report confirms, the Kremlin intervened in the Scottish referendum six years ago. The long-awaited review cites ‚Äòcredible open source commentary suggesting that Russia undertook influence campaigns in relation to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014‚Äô. This will have come as no surprise to long-time observers of Putin‚Äôs international strategy.

The report echoes the frustration of many Western analysts of Moscow‚Äôs global realpolitik:

The security threat posed by Russia is difficult for the West to manage as, in our view and that of many others, it appears fundamentally nihilistic. Russia seems to see foreign policy as a zero-sum game: any actions it can take which damage the West are fundamentally good for Russia.
Putin‚Äôs foreign policy jealously guards Russia‚Äôs geopolitical independence while aggressively pursuing destabilisation in Western nations, especially the United States and its allies. It is classical realism meets post-Soviet angst about national weakness and decline. Putin measures his regime‚Äôs power at least as much by its ability to cause external disruption as its ability to suppress internal dissent.

It will also not have come as a surprise to casual viewers of Russia Today‚Äôs coverage of the referendum campaign. There was no pretence at even-handedness: the United Kingdom was on the verge of imploding and Putin‚Äôs propagandists were keen to toss in a few grenades to help out. If it seems improbable that the annexers of Crimea would care a jot for Scottish efforts to cast off the yoke of English colonial oppression, understand that the break-up of the United Kingdom would be a coup for Putin‚Äôs Western destabilisation campaign.

Perversely, the Russian government appreciates better than our own that Scottish independence is a national security issue. If anything, the dissolution of the Union would be messier, more protracted and more distracting for the UK than the sluggish crawl out of the European Union. Brexit was cancelling a Netflix subscription compared to the winding up of 313 years of shared politics, economics and history. Scexit would see the UK retreat from the international sphere to focus on interior matters for years.

The diminution in Britain‚Äôs global standing would be in more than political coherence and confidence. The mere possibility of impending Scottish secession would severely set back Liz Truss‚Äôs efforts to secure trade deals with new partners. Investing in a country that could lose one-third of its landmass and almost one in ten of its citizens in the near future is a very different prospect to the International Trade Secretary‚Äôs current offering.

Economic damage is one thing, but what about disrupting the UK‚Äôs military capability? Despite the SNP‚Äôs decades-long campaign against Trident, Westminster seems not to apprehend that Scottish independence could unilaterally disarm the UK of its nuclear deterrent. Those defences are currently located at Faslane and Coulport but an independent SNP government would require their removal from Scotland. The Scottish government has described a report suggesting the warheads can be disarmed within weeks and the whole system transported out of Scotland in two-to-four years as ‚Äòa welcome indication of how quickly Trident could be removed‚Äô.

However, it is not a matter of simply sailing the submarines to another UK naval base. If the SNP insisted on expeditious removal, a 2013 Scottish Affairs Committee report concluded: 

""It would mean the armed submarine on patrol would be recalled, and in effect, continuous-at-sea deterrent would stop. The UK at that point would no longer be able to operate its nuclear deterrent and it is not clear how quickly the UK could restore continuous-at-sea deterrence.""

Other UK locations are either non-starters or would require significant time, investment, environmental changes or even population displacements. The tides are too low at Barrow-in-Furness, Plymouth too densely populated to store warheads nearby and Milford Haven home to liquefied natural gas plants and oil refineries. The other alternative would be relocating the submarines and warheads to the United States or France.

Britain would either be disarmed or humiliated and Nato would face losing one of its nuclear powers. For Putin, this would represent not only the humbling of a prominent Western nation but the weakening of the international body he deems the greatest obstruction to Russia‚Äôs expansionist designs. There is a reason Russia Today pumps out so much independence-related and SNP-sympathetic content. There is a reason it airs a weekly show fronted by a former first minister of Scotland and icon of Scottish nationalism. There is a reason Sputnik chose Edinburgh for its UK headquarters.

It is the same reason that Iran also interfered in the 2014 referendum: destabilising a rival power, one that plays an important role in promoting democracy, the rules-based international order and American global leadership. Our enemies see in the dismantling of the Union a chance to cut Britain down to size.

3933,"What does the ""The turk tribes were from central asia, not Turks"" means? 

There was a pretty consistent relationship of trade and exchange of Art, gifts, books between venetian ambassadors and merchants and the Ottoman Empire in the late 1400 and 1500. Italian artists and intellectuals went to Instabul for jobs and commissions. And until 19th century we shared a common Mediterranean language the ""Sabir"", something that we don't have with the rest of Europe. But to be fair, in honour of intellectual honesty, one could argue that the Muslim world in general had a pretty important role in the development of ""European culture"" : particularly when it comes to ""filosofia scolastica"" and the Renaissance, and you wouldn't necessarily call them european.

To me that is just further proof that concepts such as ""European culture"" or ""Western culture"" are pretty meaningless. We are talking of groups of really variagated cultures, with profoundly different influences. That all happen to be sharing the same continent. So Turkey is both European and Asian geographically, and in term of culture I don't know, (and I don't care) because I don't think it's possible to find one linear conductive thread that unites the various European cultures. And therefore I feel that people are that are singling out Turkey are not doing it based on a pretty foggy sense of common culture, but out of the misconceived notion that to be European is to be Christian.","Veneto, Italy",/r/europe/comments/hu6re4/a_policy_of_withholding_funds_from_nations_who_do/fyya3f8/,Giallo555,1595481207

4007,"The short answer would be to ask you to read up on the ""Frugal four"", and their unwillingness to be forced to loan money globally only to grant it to the southern parts of Europe.

The long answer: Basically Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, and Austria, (and with some indirect support from Finland) were strictly against the recovery plan consisting of grants rather than loans, as suggested by the EU council. And with every nation having a direct veto vote, even without the UK (who would surely have been against it too, but far stronger than these four) theoretically any of the four could have stopped the whole operation.

In the end they agreed on a 50/50 compromise, with 50% of the money basically being loans to the nations affected by the other EU nations, while the other 50% being grants, which means they will not have to pay the money back. All of the money (both loans and grants) will be lended by the Union as a whole, meaning that   (as I understand it) 50% of what countries such as the Frugal Four (and France, Germany, as well as many other membership countries) will not get half of that money back. And it's a very large sum.

The Frugal Four got some other advantages by accepting the deal though, such as an overall rebate on the membership fee, as well as in Sweden's case some promises that the money sent to the south will be focused on renewable energy, and if my assumption is correct the Netherlands (and it was also one of the key points for Sweden) got promises that the grants can be cancelled if the nations recieving them does not live up to the democracy standards of the union - something Hungary and moreso Poland was taking a position against, before the deal was reached.

Of course I'm missing a lot of minor details, and I don't know what made Denmark and Austria go along with the compromise (unless they accepted what Sweden and the Netherlands pushed for), but it's a clusterfuck but hopefully it will work out for the best.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/hw11fc/macron_the_agreement_on_a_eu_recovery_plan_is_the/fyxyjir/,Lusakas,1595473227

4019,"&gt; Nobody was helping American and Australian colonists 300 years ago to build better life. State was far away across the ocean and that was the biggest help. Sometimes the best State can do is leave you alone.

Err while I lean closest to neolib myself, I'm definitely on the statist side of neolibs. And speaking of neolib being used as an insult with no understanding of the term, why are neolibs being conflated with libertarians when a huge portion of neolibs are massive Keynesians, which is basically on the heavily statist side of capitalist ideologies. 

Anyway, I take some issue with your ""nobody was helping Ami/Aussie colonists"". Nah, they had the immense support network of England and later Great Britain. Lots of stuff like using the rich industrial base of their home country as a springboard, using the significant investment from home country, using the massive Royal Navy to safeguard their trade routes, using the disciplined British Army to cement their holdings. 

You know what hell the colonists in America went through before Brits put an end to the French North American colonies during the Seven Year's War? French were friendly with a lot of Amerindian tribes for a variety of reasons and they helped many of those tribes to attack the colonists. Removing competition of those colonists was a big deal for the development of the 13 colonies. Colonies wither when they have to field large military expenditures just to maintain their hold on the new land -- and worst of all, the deleterious effects of prolonged militarism on the civilian government cannot be overstated. 

The Brits cleaned it all up for colonists, took care of pirates, brought the colonies together with new markets. They did a lot for 13 Colonies but in the end those colonies rebelled due to laughably small tax increases (in fact the biggest issue was arguably the trade partner restrictions for the upper crust of the colonial sphere).",Apparently Serbia according to /u/cLnYze19N,/r/europe/comments/hvuoi3/as_eastern_europe_shrinks_rural_bulgaria_is/fyxzlpk/,Aemilius_Paulus,1595473884

The fact that the two states viewed themselves as so clearly separate that they could go to war with each other was a counter-point to the idea that they viewed themselves as administrative divisions of the whole Roman Empire. The point in contention is that the ERE that continued up to 1453 was not ""The Roman Empire"", whatever they called themselves, but a culturally distinct entity that had lost its claim to be Roman.

4078,"Well there are two ways to see a problem. Either it is that the EU isn't a (fiscal) federation or that the countries don't have individual control over the euro.

To explain a bit more. When managing a economy you want your fiscal policy to match the behavior of your currency. Thus the same organization that makes the fiscal policy needs to control the currency. This is needed when, for example, getting a good balance of import and export value or controlling your countries debt (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro#Macroeconomic_stability) for more details). The problem is that, while the fiscal policy is done by the individual countries, the monetary policy is managed collectively by countries which have different requirements (for example the south needs a higher inflation rate than the north due to the different about of debt).

There are two solutions. Either make the fiscal policy collective (for example by a glorious EU federation) or by giving each country their own currency again (a option in between is having a Neuro (northern euro), which has low inflation, and a Seuro (southern euro), which has high inflation, but this is politically even worse).",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/hw11fc/macron_the_agreement_on_a_eu_recovery_plan_is_the/fyy4kvw/,Highlow9,1595477129

My girlfriend grew up in a village and hers is really one of the nicer ones in Romania, they have everything, broadband internet, running water, sewage, paved streets, even a convenience store. But still, life there sucks, from the perspective of a young person used to modern urban life:

-	There are no restaurants, just a skanky bar where the village drunks gather
-	whenever you need anything other than basic necessities (like say clothes) you have to travel to the city
-	if you order stuff online you always pay extra for shipping, which, depending on how far your village is from a decently sized city can add up to quite a lot of money
-	you don‚Äôt often get opportunities to meet new people and make new friends because everyone already knows each other
-	no good schools or jobs
-	no privacy, people are extremely nosy and if you act like you value your privacy, like not inviting your neighbor in just because he stumbled on your door without calling you first you will be seen as a weirdo
-	no freedom. When you live in the countryside there‚Äôs always some shit that you need to do around the house - feed the pigs, milk the cow, pull out the weeds etc. You barely have any time for yourself.

They're already buying stuff from Russia. S400 etc. Appeasing them obviously hasn't stopped them from doing it. And they are likely to step up their procurement of Russian and/or Chinese hardware after the US kicked them out from the F35 program. And the US likely won't permit Lockheed to sell upgrades for Turkey's aging F16 fleet. So I'm not sure what you mean by the US laughing at anyone pursuing a policy of determent towards Turkey, the US has routinely slapped Turkey around to great effect recently. The EU would only stand to gain from finally standing up to them. And to be honest its high time to show that the EU is willing to back up its member nations. The EU, among other things, is a defensive military alliance after all.

What happened next still gives me goosebumps: some Aussie told the bartender to turn up the news and shouted for the others in the bar to STFU. They all gathered in front of the TV, baffled, shocked and in instant sorrow. None knew we were Norwegian, so hearing them talk among themselves as how in the hell this could happen in such a small, country, the country of the peace prize and known for peacemaking in the middle east etc makes me tear up to this day. Every person in the bar just mourned with us, not a single joke cracked as expected from rowdy day drinkers.

They sound so much kinder than Americans who joke about pinochet throwing people from helicopteres and Anders and things like that.

4285,"&gt; Belgium also had high public debt in 90's(140% of gdp) and manged to get things under control.

It really is a similar pattern for Belgium, at a lower level: debt reduction starting around 1992 at a steady pace of about 1% per year to 80% until the banking crisis in 2007, at which point they shoot back up to 100% until they manage to stabilize.

&gt;Any labor reform that makes firing people easier and less costly is good.

No, like the above analysis wrote, it reduced buying power and therefore internal demand, suppressing economical growth. If you want to reduce friction on the labor market, not a bad goal in itself, you can't just look at it from the employers' perspective: you also have to take the perspective of the employee in account, and they are only going to jump when they have sufficient social security, because their entire income depends on their job.

&gt;You can't create more value per capita if you are not changing what you are producing and how.
&gt;It should be easy to fire useless paper pushing bureaucrats.

Sure, but what are we going to do with all those ex-commercial consultants and ex-HR managers? The private sector produces more than their share of wasted labor. 

Like written in the analysis, part of the problem are relatively low-value exports vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations. Those aren't bureaucrats.

4432,"&gt;Facism often pushes legitamte monarchs away from power like in Japan. 

There is no such thing as a ""legitimate monarch"".


&gt;Just because there were facist monarchs doesn't mean that facism isn't an enemy of monarchy.

So we have this saying here in Germany, you might heard of it:

If there is a Nazi sitting on a table and ten people come by and sit down without speaking up against them, then there are ten Nazis sitting on that table. A fascist king is a fascist.



&gt;facism hurts the monarchy and plays a part in it's fall from power.

Like in Spain, where it literally gets reinstated by the fascists (Spain was a republic before the civil war)?


&gt;In an ideal monarchy the monarch serves as a guard agtainst radicalist and extremists.

Like in Italy and Japan, where they just stood on the side and let everything happen?



&gt;To make myself clear I'm a very constinual monarch, who believes that the monarch shouldn't excersice direct power but instead protect the nation from radicals and serve as a figurehead to unite people.

4492,"I didn't see the ""nicht ganz"" as important, as it seems that ultimately the Soviet victory in Manchuria would be disregarded completely in the context of the Japanese surrender. 

With ""Russia is a huhe country that made a great contribution to the fall of National Socialism"",They do indeed acknowledge the Eastern front, though it would be hard to exclude this, (however there is a history of the greatest focus being put on the western front.)... But acknowledging the eastern front and the race to Berlin, while ignorring the Soviets in Manchuria and the race to Japan still doesn't sit right with me. Although they joined the Asian theatre right towards the end after the U S did most of the heavy lifting, They were ultimately still just as significant to their surrender as the U.S with the atomic bombs.

We always acknowledge the significance of the U.S in Europe even though they also joined after most of the heavy lifting was done by the Soviets.. why not extend the same courtesy to the Soviets involvement in Asia...

Tho I'd actually need to see all of the exibit and tour to form a full opinion with all context in mind... 

Also, I'm fully aware of Russias attempt to glorify Stalin and the Soviet union and boast about the glorious achievements of the Red Army... but again, I see this as a knee jerk reaction, So many Soviet people have died on the eastern front, yet troughout the cold war and even to this day, they are vilified and the Soviet effort and sufferring downplayed in every aspect except for when the death toll of Stalins communism is being discused. 

Twice as many Slavic people were sistematically purged in the Soviet sphere as there were Jews killed in the Holochaust... and yet, it's mostly ignored.. theres only Hitlers Holochaust killed 6 million jews, Stalinism killed 20million or 8 million or 60million people(depending on who you ask) where is Generalplan OST.

I'll say it now, I do sympathise with the Russians.., yet I do not condone their attempts at whitewashing Stalin as a hero only, to balance the Western approach of painting him purely as a villain, and the whole of Russia with him.

4499,"The rationale ""they only believe or behave or value what their culture taught them, and since their culture is patriarchal/oppressive it is less legitimate than our beliefs, values and behaviors"". It's kind of a moot point, as assimilation to a new culture happens somewhat naturally with time, and the mingling of cultures can lead to challenges, conflicts, adaptation, adoption of what the broader culture sees as beneficial. It's also odd to rationalize ""In fact it's ok to force their assimilation, because even their own broader culture rejects their values and behaviors, so they're really a bunch of nobody's"". Yeesh, I can understand why one culture might want a new group to assimilate faster if it threatens stability of the dominant culture, fear of takeover by the foreigner, fear of losing gains the broader culture values. However, I keep seeing Europeans say over and over how small of a minority these women are, so surely they are not a threat to the stability of the broader culture. While Europeans may say ""we are not a patriarchal society"", as a US citizen who's very attuned to my own countries blindness to it's own patriarchy and denial of what could be doing to promote women's inclusion... I just know that all economies have benefitted from the unpaid labor of domestic activities (historically and still largely performed by women). Here in the US it would be nice if they proposed legislation that addressed the fact that women bear more student debt than men (as childbirth and early childcare presents an obstacle to their educational and career tracks). Single mothers and poorer mothers are more often targeted by fast-track training centers with crap accreditations/exorbitant costs, that promise with flexible training hours to get women into better paying fields. That women are still required to engage in economic industry (which was not designed for a citizen that could become pregnant). So many US women delay childbirth as they would risk a state of dependency (all states of dependency open the risk to violence and oppression). That still many of our employers skirt the laws meant to protect us from discrimination should we have the audacity to become pregnant (at-will employment states can terminate the employment of any worker without explanation, and the burden of proving they caught wind of your pregnancy or feared you may dare to request unpaid FMLA leave is left to the unemployed woman to prove in court with a crap probono lawyer as affording decent representation is the luxury of the wealthy). Many US women carrying burdensome student debt they can never discharge even through bankruptcy are having to choose between delaying the start of a family, marrying and possibly losing their home's value to the federal government if they default on the student debt or losing her SSI in her elder years not to mention having to base repayment off of a combined income that doesn't leave them much left over to afford childcare and both retain their careers, or cohabitating with none of the protection of a husband's health insurance, no access to his SSI in old age if he passes before her, and likely the house would stay in her partner's name so that if she defaulted in their childrearing years her family would not bear the consequence, and I should add she would not have protection of alimony in the event of a divorce should the couple be forced to choose to keep the job the pays the most (predominantly these are positions that men hold) and she have to cut her hours to provide the childcare. Since 1 in 4 US women experience domestic violence, the chances are pretty high that the disbalance of power put her at risk of oppression, and she may face these choices in the midst of that crisis with none of the protections that could ensure her safety and stability after escape. In the US, I at least feel pressured to choose between infertility with inclusion, or fertility and exclusion. Playing a game of economics in a society rigged for fierce competition from the outset, that forces me to hopefully choose a decent partner who will fight against incredible odds stacked against the both of us just to promote my inclusion, yet who might also protect me if those odds fail me. So no wonder women here are choosing to pump our bodies with progesterone despite it's mental and physical effects just so we can finish a degree, finish another good quarter in a good job, etc.
 Europe in general has done well with paid parental leave, I'm ignorant as to whether childcare is affordable abroad, or whether temporary work/flexible work that still women predominate in is paid well, or whether higher education is accommodating to mothers without taking advantage of her need for accomodation. I don't know if women abroad are still facing an onslaught of messages that tell them they have worth as long as they remain unattached with no children and their sexuality easily accessible to men.
 I shaved my head in my early twenties as a rejection to constant media images normalizing women's sexual objectification, and it made me understand/relate to some of my peers, muslim women who chose suddenly in adulthood to wear hijab as a rejection of western shaming of islam in the post 9/11climate, but they also expressed a similar rejection of sexual objectification. In the US at least, can't even seem to sell a product without putting pieces of a women's body around it. I didn't immediately dismiss their statements with a patronizing ""well you're an oppressed woman, so your opinions are less credible, as it's likely you only have those opinions because of the men in your life"". I mean historically, isn't that what the dominant culture has always used an excuse to deligitimize women's perspectives. It's what they said about women suffragists here when they wanted the right to inclusion in voting.

I say all this because surely there are still more pressing priorities that affect women in Europe, so it's odd to focus on forcing a small portion of women to quickly assimilate. Surely if she chose to take the fabric off at school of her own volition, the authorities would defend her access to education if the parents punished her by stopping her education entirely. They'd also protect any child who was punished with violence (we don't always even have that in the US). So again, it's just bizarre to propose a ban.

Forced assimilation for the ""sake of the minority"", has happened before. Look to Canada's and the US's history when native indigenous people had their children removed from their homes and placed into boarding schools meant to erase their cultural beliefs and force quick assimilation. The children forgot their native languages, struggled to connect with their families and still were largely rejected by the broader culture (not to mention traumatized by abuse that proliferates within institutionalization).
It just seems like a gaslight when those who propose the ban insist that the key to loosening oppression and control of women, is to make a  decision for them. The bans would impact adult women in higher education, who ought to not be such a threat to the dominant culture.",,/r/europe/comments/hvn57x/german_state_bans_burqas_in_schools/fyvzmxo/,BudgieBirbs,1595436705

As for our wealth, we are in the unique position as being the only former colony of western europe. As a result, any industry was largely killed in the crib by our overlords in london, as it would compete with british producers. Our woolen industry in the 1700's was destroyed by punitive tarriffs put on exports by london to protect british producers.

Irelands role was to be the bread basket for britain. No industrialisation took place here as it was deliberately discouraged by government and an exploitative, inefficient land owning class. Poor tenant farmers produced food for export to britain. This money largely went to wealthy, absentee british aristocrats. Our population was then critically damaged by the famine, which only compounded our economic misery.

That dual lack of population and capital meant the irish economic growth was stunted for centuries. Whilst europe industrialised off the back of a critical mass of a large labour pool and sufficient capital from growing industry, Ireland was left behind, depopulated and poor.

If resources were the sole decider of wealth, then why is russia not fabulously wealthy historically? Or if it is a lack of resources that makes a nation poor, why is denmark wealthy? Ultimately it is good governance, good people, stability and most importantly freedom from exploitation that allows a nation to prosper.

Kastellorizo is a prime example of that. It does become problematic when tried to be forced upon larger islands like Crete and Cyprus though. Both Turkish position of no islands having full EEZ no matter their size and Greek position of insisting on full EEZ on every desolate Aegean rock are aggressive positions that would never survive int. arbitration.

On the other side of the coin, Turkey is trying to solve this issue without any negotiations. The agreements made
with TRNC and Libyan gov., neither internationally fully recognized states, are obviously illegitimate. Turkey blames Greece for that, saying they don't want to negotiate so Turkey found other partners. Greece says that they won't negotiate precisely because Turkey is forcing the issue. Greece rejects international arbitration except by the EU which Turkey doesn't accept. Syria, France and Egypt are on the Greek/Cypriot side mostly due to their unrelated issues with Turkey. Turkey blames Greece saying they are trying to force their position by creating an ""anti-Turkish"" alliance, forcing Turkey to turn into military solutions instead of negotiations to protect its interests.

4751,"&gt;To this time, yes. But to this time, there was hardly a theory of state, like we would consider it today.

So if there was no theory of state back then (which is correct), then why do you use the same theory of state to justify the end being at some arbitrary point of division, which the people of the time would likewise not consider a break.

Why does it matter what the Franks thought, but not what the Greeks thought?

This is a circular argument.

&gt;the Merovingians who established the later France (I would say) did use the political culture established by the roman principate.

It's one thing to adopt local institutions and politics from a people you've conquered, and it's another to be the local people that is still using the local political culture.

Again, they're not really comparable.

&gt;I say it was a dismembration. The Roman Empire did resolve itself. There wasnt a central governance anymore but rather two new states with an own state authority in either of their realms. 

I'll just ignore that you contradict yourself later by saying that your core argument here is actually a modern concept that didn't apply to the time.

Ok, so let's break this down.
According to you, what made them seperate from the pre-395 Roman Empire was:

1: Central governance

2: Territory

The problem here is that the central government in both halves remained the same. There was no real change in either half, the division was too short (only 85 years) to make any kind of meaningful governmental impact. 

You also have the problem that these institutions overlap with eachother. Arcadius and Honorius were Co-Emperors before Theodosius died for example. 

Also, what makes this division different from the others? The only difference is that this time, one half was dissolved and wasn't reunited with the other half. If dividing the Empire creates two new entities then the 'orginial' Roman Empire would **have** to end in 286, not 395. Why is the Eastern Empire different in 395, but not in 286, before the other half falls exactly?

Then there's territory, and again they overlap.
The core territory of the Western Empire was Italy, which the East reconquered in its entirety, plus Africa and southern Hispania. It's not like the Eastern Empire was always vaguely in the east.

So you're kind of stuck here. Either the 'original' Roman Empire ends when it is divided, creating two new entities, which means it ends in 286 **OR** it ends in 480 when one half falls.

If it's the latter, that means loss of territory actually is the defining factor, not division. Which still doesn't work, because if territory is important, then one can't reconcile the fact that the East reconquered most of the West later.",Kingdom of France,/r/europe/comments/hvp785/zweikaiserproblem_a_hefty_historiographical_term/fyv90w9/,Anthemius_Augustus,1595422620

So therefore they want more than the Canada deal. not the same deal.

4769,"Im norwegian and was in Indonesia, about to go to sleep when the explosion happened. Suddenly SMS's ticket in like ""are you ok?"". Didnt have internet so just heard from my dad what was up, and immediately chocked it up to an accident, and went to sleep.

Next day we went on a dolphin safari really early, and coming back the first thing I did was to check the news... it was weird that I couldnt see any mention of the explosion, took a few long moments to take in the fact that every single article was about shooting on this island. Checking Facebook was a horror movie.

We immediately found a bar with a TV to check any reporting, an Aussie sports pub full of tattooed, hardened expats. It was insane to see Australian news reporting live from outside my place of work in Oslo. What happened next still gives me goosebumps: some Aussie told the bartender to turn up the news and shouted for the others in the bar to STFU. They all gathered in front of the TV, baffled, shocked and in instant sorrow. None knew we were Norwegian, so hearing them talk among themselves as how in the hell this could happen in such a small, country, the country of the peace prize and known for peacemaking in the middle east etc makes me tear up to this day. Every person in the bar just mourned with us, not a single joke cracked as expected from rowdy day drinkers.

What should happen is the UK govt buys fishing quotas until the total owned by UK is again 50pct. Then it is fair to split and take 50pct of the previously shared waters.

Another issue with this is that there must be new guarantees that the UK does not just increase quotas afterwards. That would prompt all other parties to do the same.

4958,"&gt; Wealth accumulation provides capital, which is crucial for investment in the economic regime that we operate in (that's why it's called capitalism). Of course one also needs sufficiently enlightened governance, which countries such as Spain didn't have at the time. The worst problem of poorer countries is precisely the lack of sufficient capital, which is why they depend on foreign investments and all that entails.

You still have this backwards. The capital was already there in europe. Or where do you think the whole infrastructure that allowed colonialism came from?

You don't understand capitalism. Because what you are talking about is mercantilism. Wealth doesn't bring capital or productivity. Productivity brings wealth and capital. You keep having it backwards because stockpiling gold in a vault and funding armies to conquer land (what colonial powers did) doesn't bring prosperity.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism#:~:text=Mercantilism%20is%20an%20economic%20policy,reach%20a%20current%20account%20surplus.

If you still don't understand it. Capital is the good required outside of labor and land required for production. Money isn't a measure of capital its a measure of productivity multiplied by time. Its a measure of build up wealth. You can't make tools of money(gold). Iron ore, wood, a blacksmith, labor and knowledge are required. (you can have wealth in the form of tools but the colonies didn't export industrial goods). Money is only a created construct here to lubricate the transaction to get everything easily together. But more money doesn't increase the speed or probability of this happening because of a thing called inflation (the value of gold or money is the stuff you can buy with it. more gold means higher prices in gold. Less gold means lower prices) Standard fiscal economics.

Secondly the colonies provided luxury goods like spices, jewels and valuable metals not industrial goods, metal ores, coal or machinery that fueled the european industrialization. You also don't understand capital. Capital are goods that allow production capacity. Tools, buildings, steam engines, horses and boats. The colonies didn't provide that. Money(or gold) isn't capital outside of trading capital for a trader aka the money needed form corporations to pay their immediate bills. Machinery and steel have to be produced before they can be bought. Those were products of the european continent.

The production capacity for industry already was there. The money from colonialism wasn't invested into industry they were invested into colonies.

Colonies provided luxury goods like spices and sugar that allowed merchants to build very fancy houses and wear very fancy clothes. It weren't those merchants that funded the industrial revolution. 

Pretty much all big names of the industrial revolution aren't connected to colonialism. Most inventors and investors of the european industrialization where low nobles or citizens.

4966,"&gt;Sure, could be that in the 30 years post-WW2 most government debt was held by monetary institutions. Those years also had a lot of inflation, whereas in recent years there's a lot less of that.

I sincerely doubt that is the reason. My personal opinion is Japanification. Aging population and higher inequality are lowering demand, boosting saving and lowering interest rates.

At the same time, globalization is boosting supply by introducing millions of new workers in global supply chains.

This structural weak demand-strong supply dynamic is pushing down on inflation. The correlation between money supply and inflation has always been weak. [1](https://fixingtheeconomists.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/money-supplies-vs-inflation.jpg) [2](https://fixingtheeconomists.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/money-supplies-vs-inflation-regressions.jpg)
&gt;You quote two working papers. I have heard of either author before, nor or the Levy Institute. No offense, but I would much prefer papers published in peer-reviewed and well-rated journals. Results like the second one you name should merit enough attention for at least a good B-journal, I'd say. I'm not demanding AER or so, but perhaps a bit more ""standard"" literature?

The peer reviewed papers on monetary financing are quite scarce. I am looking foward to when the field expands.

&gt;The result that monetary financing and inflation should not be connected seems fairly odd. I of course accept that monetary policy is not the end-all be-all in that respect, and monetary economics is not my main area, so I'm no expert there.

I think Japan is another great example here. Bank of Japan has been hoovering up Japanese government bonds for years, taking its balance sheet as a share of GDP to levels previously seen only in war time. Yet it is difficult to argue that monetary policy has been too loose in Japan, when inflation is still hovering barely above zero...

The average bloke works every day from 8 to 5, does nothing most of the day and has a relatively boring life. Most movies are about minorities because nobody wants to see a movie about you or me.

Soldiers and cops are a smaller percentage of the population in many western countries and yet movies are full of them. Romantic partners that fall in love head over heel are pretty rare and yet there's tons of movies about that. People of different ethnicities are usually over represented in movies as well. 

Wanna know what all of these have in common? They are usually in a position in their lives that makes the movie interesting. There is some kind of struggle, some kind of story that is different then ours. Gay people might be slightly over-represented at the moment (although that's pretty debatable considering how many movies and series are coming out every day) because for a very long time, movies avoided them, so there's a lot of interesting stories that can still be told there.

\- Reducing emigration, especially among the highly skilled (as they pay more taxes)

\- Increasing immigration, with an eye into likely long-term needs (to avoid the quintessentially European issue of immigrants having higher unemployment)

 The draft resolution on the Central Communication Port is to be adopted in the third quarter of this year - it follows from the list of legislative and program works of the Council of Ministers. It is at the preparatory work stage.  


It is about a draft resolution of the Council of Ministers on the establishment of a long-term program - ""Central Communication Port Investment Program. Stage I. 2020-2023"".  


""This program confirms and supplements the arrangements and decisions contained in the resolution of the Council of Ministers of November 7, 2017 (...), pursuant to which the Council of Ministers adopted the Concept for the preparation and implementation of the Port Solidarity - Central Communication Port for the Republic of Poland (. ..) The CPK program establishes the financial framework and the conditions for organizing the implementation of the plans of the Republic of Poland in the scope of the Central Communication Port. The CPK program thus confirms the assumptions adopted in the CPK Concept, and at the same time implements the order contained in the Act on CPK ""- we read in the list of legislative and program works Council of Ministers.  
The first step  


As it was written, the CPK Program concerns the first stage of the CPK investment process, falling in the years 2020-2023, i.e. the stage of preparatory works.  


As part of the first stage - as indicated - subsequent phases of the design documentation will be developed and administrative decisions necessary to enter the stage of implementation of individual construction plans will be obtained.  


""The main goal of the first stage is to define the scope and scale of the investment in detail, to adopt optimal solutions with regard to possible variants of the project implementation, to define the optimal plan for its implementation, detailed schedules and budgets for individual projects, as well as to define the method of their financing, including from public funds. ""- it was written.  


It has been added that Stage II (execution of construction works) will be carried out on the basis of materials developed in the course of the previous stage.  


""Unprecedented project""  


As it was written, in accordance with the assumptions of the CPK concept, ""we are dealing with a unique and unprecedented infrastructure project not only in Poland, but in the entire region"".  


""The project (...), which will consist of over 120 buildings and structures. The passenger terminal itself, with an estimated area of ‚Äã‚Äã400-500 thousand square meters, will be one of the largest cubature facilities in Poland. The project will require the installation of advanced devices and systems, such as luggage systems, IT systems, ATM systems, ""we read.  


It was added that all these elements and systems would have to be put into service at approximately the same time and then prepared for operational use.  


""It should also be emphasized that the project will be implemented in an area that is currently agricultural land, which involves, for example, the need to provide the area with full utilities, and raises challenges related to environmental protection, water relations, protection of local communities or ensuring spatial planning of the surroundings. investment ""- it was written.  


It was emphasized that the STH investment program at each of its stages, ie planning, design, construction and operational preparation, will be a project ""of an unprecedented scale and complexity in Poland.""  
CPK  


The Central Communication Port is a planned transfer hub between Warsaw and ≈Å√≥d≈∫, which will integrate air, rail and road transport. As part of this project, 37 km west of Warsaw, in an area of ‚Äã‚Äãapprox. 3 thousand. hectares, the Solidarno≈õƒá Airport will be built, which in the first stage will be able to serve 45 million passengers per year.

5195,"Maybe Kostov and some other early Prime ministers did well, but the situation left after communism was just too bad. You could be right about that.

Media like [Capital.bg](https://Capital.bg) and [Dnevnik.bg](https://Dnevnik.bg) are against government. BTV is owned by a foreign company. And I see all the bad things about the government on most Bulgarian media (like apartamentgate, etc) so I do not think media is oppressed.

I watched the ""Eight Dwarfs"" last week. If it is true it is indeed extremely bad. And I would support prosecuting all involved and Geshev should resign in this case. Unfortunately only proof was the story of this businessman and I do not believe him 100%. His actions are not very logical.  He constantly agrees to sign ANYTHING he is given by the corrupt prosecutor like a moron (if he were such moron how he made such a big business). And why did not he take his family feud to court and instead went to the mafia? Could he be the bad guy and not his family as he claims?

I liked how Geshev started to prosecute several rich oligarchs (something unseen till now). Could this be in fact just a plot to take these businesses from the owners and give them to Geshev's own friends? Yes it is possible, but I do not know for now. We need to see what happens to these businesses after their owners are stripped of them. Actually instead of giving the Bozhkov's multimillion gambling business to someone else, GERB and Patriots voted a law that forbids private gambling (BSP voted against!). What a surprise - if they were really the mafia (as protesters claim) why dissolve such a lucrative business instead of stealing it? And Geshev's efforts were in vain - what a pity :)

What  bothers me is that all this activity - Dwarves, Rosenec, Borisov room photos - happened exactly when Bozhkov was charged. It almost looks like he organized all these things. I do not know what is actually true and cannot form an opinion at the moment. When we do know I am all for wrong doers to go to prison.

Even if Geshev is organizing all these bad things, I still do not understand why the government should also resign - what did Borisov do wrong? (phone and photo compromats could be fabricated). Elections are in 7 months. Why should Radev/BSP rule for 3 months. They always do a lot of harm to Bulgaria. What about the rights of all those people who voted for GERB + United Patriots? 1.4 million people voted for them. Now several thousand protest and government should resign?? Democracy means that majority rule. If 1.4 million come to the streets to protest, then  the situation will be quite different and resignation should be immediate. Otherwise why bother to go and vote in elections if later 10 000 people can demand resignations and change the government as they wish...

To be fully honest, I am ashamed by some of the things Borisov says from time to time. But I think he is not a bad person and actually wants to improve Bulgaria.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/hv0a7w/breaking_during_day_5_of_the_eu_council_summit_a/fyu1ysz/,e200,1595386390

5255,"Something remarkable happened yesterday. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, having arrived in the UK the evening before, chose to meet a group of MPs before holding talks with the Government. Even more remarkable was the fact that the MPs and members of the House of Lords were drawn not just from the Conservative ranks, but also from Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP. The issue that had brought everyone together was China.
The irony is that the meeting took place at the same time as the much-vaunted Intelligence and Security Committee report on Russian interference in UK elections was published.

Yet for all its apparent revelations, the truth is that we have known about the threat from Russia for some time, and the West has been united in its condemnation. There may be some specific lessons to be learnt. But the idea that, following our strong response to the Skripal poisonings, ministers‚Äô denunciation of Russia‚Äôs attempt to manipulate the 2019 general election, and the imposition of sanctions on the Putin regime we are somehow failing to contend with the Russian threat is absurd.

In any case, staring us in the face is a far greater threat: China.
Too often in past weeks, the issues around Huawei, human rights abuses of the Uighurs, and potential Magnitsky sanctions on China have been treated as a Tory psycho-drama, yet nothing could be further from the truth. The serious concerns about Beijing are shared across the political divide, and the Pompeo meeting showed that.

The issue of China and its totalitarian government has over the past few months also become more stark and more urgent. Across a range of issues, Beijing‚Äôs behaviour has broken all international norms. Its imposition of a new security law on Hong Kong, contrary to the Sino-UK agreement, allows the Chinese security services to seize people they disapprove of and try them, very unfavourably, in China.

To that we must also add aggression in the South China Sea and more and more belligerent threats aimed at Taiwan. Persecution of Christians, Falun Gong and the Uighurs are enormous human rights abuses and have been ignored by governments across the free world, in their pursuit of trade advantage and Chinese investment.
While the UK has begun to toughen its position, government after government has in effect kow-towed apologetically. A picture of the Chinese regime, all powerful at home and aggressive abroad, is enough to leave Western governments fearful of upsetting them.
Yet there is another way to see China, one that allows us to chart a more determined course.

China has for over two decades succeeded in growing its economy at incredible rates by opening its markets, in turn sucking in investment from the West. This has resulted in the lifting of living standards for large swathes of the population, and simultaneously creating a significant middle class.

While the economy grows, many of them accept totalitarianism. The vast majority of Chinese people have always been ruled by communist governments anyway, so recent improvements in their living standards make such control all the more normalised.

Yet over the past few years that relentless growth has begun to stutter. Great plans to create a first world economy more technologically advanced than the West have stalled, exemplified by China‚Äôs dependence on US-designed microchips. The country still lags 10 to 12 years behind in areas like this.

Furthermore, hi-tech Western companies are more reluctant to leave themselves at the mercy of industrial espionage, which has so characterised China‚Äôs determination to catch up.

The regime has, meanwhile, become ever more wary of dissent. As one Chinese dissident put it to me, the severity of the crackdown is not a sign of strength but of growing insecurity. The worry for China is that Hong Kong‚Äôs demands, like some kind of infection, spill onto the mainland.

Which brings me back to the Pompeo meeting. What struck me most was the sense of agreement around the room ‚Äì we are not engaged in Sinophobia, and we do want to engage with China but Beijing cannot be allowed to set the terms. The terrible human rights abuses, the disregard of the rules governing the free market and the aggression against its neighbours have to be called out.
And just as in the case of Russia where, contrary to the ill-informed perspective of America‚Äôs critics, Washington has been robust in its treatment of Putin, what came out loud and clear from the meeting was the desire of the United States to work with its friends and allies, particularly with the UK. For if we are to ensure that our hard-fought liberties and freedoms are not to be trampled on and the terrible lessons of the past are to be heeded, we need an alliance of the free world and urgently.",,/r/europe/comments/hvmh30/china_is_our_greatest_threat_not_putins_russia/fyu6mkz/,casualphilosopher1,1595389329

5274,"&gt; I look at it like this: Yes it is redistribution, but the incentives are still correct. Unemployment and a lack of fiscal responsibility are still bad for a country. The redistribution alleviates some of it, but not enough to actually ""reward"" it. As long as that is true, the overall development will be positive.

Not true at all. The worse a country behaves fiscally, the more likely it is to get a check a few months or years down the line. Italy hasn't gotten it's act together since 2014/15. Now it gets even more money.

&gt; The disparities aren't nearly big enough for a conclusion like that. Italy is a net contributor and always has been, just like France. Sure, if you split the EU down the middle, the northern economy would probably grow faster than the southern one, but the differences wouldn't be nearly big enough to offset all the sacrifices and problems such a split would cause.

Some countries naturally pegged their currencies to the DMark before the Euro, like Austria. Italy was not one of those countries, because the economics were (are) *too different*. 

The approaches of Italy vs. Germany are so different, it's unfathomable. For one, Italy's approach is more like ""trial and error"". If wages grew too fast and exports were too expensive, they just inflated their currency. Germany never did that after WW2. Those are two incompatible approaches to the economics of a country, as simple as that. Now Italy can't simply inflate their price issues away and the rest of us is going to pay for that.",,/r/europe/comments/hv0a7w/breaking_during_day_5_of_the_eu_council_summit_a/fyu8vff/,Gas_Straight,1595390848

Lets take the Italy thing - Yes, Italy has a rather high tax (not as high as most of the northern countries, but high). It also has the absolute lowest number of average years on the job market (a literal DECADE earlier compared to Sweden).   


This falls directly into the category of ""do some do okay based on 1 of the 2?"" which i literally just wrote. Same goes for Portugal - It has a high retirement age - but it has low taxes. It does good on 1 out of two. Same goes for France - high tax, but young retirement. 1 out of 2. Greece has a middling tax, but a very early retirement age. ¬Ω out of 2.

None of the southern countries does well on **both** parameters.

1) this is not first time that Turkey enters Greece, Turkey claims same thing back because of conflict of sea border

2) Sea borders of islands and main land is not even equal. The border of mainland has 10s more than islands which requires more sea area. You can not claim entire sea from mainland to islands. In that case USA would own ALL PASIFIC for their small islands in ocean .

3) Aegean sea islands are unique. It is too close to mainland of Turkey. Greece wants to make it 12 miles which makes IMPOSSIBLE for Turkey to move ships. Just look at Aegean sea islands, you will see what I mean.

5357,"It is low chance that you can be Turkish, since people in Turkey mostly are not Turkish but Anatolian, it is just we embrace the Turkic heritage the most. Otherwise, not so many people looks east asian here. It was Inonu, who negotiated for treaty of lausanne but the thing is smyrna was already liberated but islands were not. So I think it is more about just putting what has already done on paper and stop the war at that point. Real negotations were about G√∂k√ßeada and Bozcaada which are next to Dardanelles. Actually, most people, including Turkish people, do think, Istanbul is given back to Turkey easily, which is not. UK, especially PM Lloyd, didn't want to give up there no matter what. That caused Chanak Crisis, unfortunately its wiki page is not informative enough but maybe one day I can make a post about it. For example there was an secret agreement between bolsheviks and Turkey and if there were to happen a large scale war between Turkey and Allies, russia was going to start a war against allies as well. I am not a cult of personality kind of guy but taking back Istanbul without fight is one of the instances where I respect Ataturk the most. If he couldn't do that, we could have seen a WW2 just after the first one. And Lloyd insisted so much, some British colonies agreed to send soldier again but France didn't want to fight and Ataturk played 4D chess, so one morning France just sends a telegraph to Brits and says something like 'hey we are dealing with Turks soon, they are already falling back, just get out of Istanbul'. In the end they didn't even ask about Lloyds opinion.


About the Islands, Turkish claim on Aegean side is stupid AF cuz there are so many islands, I am just talking about mediternean EEZ. Especially about island of Kastelorizo. Also, if this EEZ was a thing before Lousanne nobody would say anything. The problem is it happens afterwards, where you just lose your freedom out of nowhere. So it is kinda uncool.

 And I do believe K√ºnefe is also not Turkish origin but hey others create those, we make them perfect.


Unfortunately, day by day I lose my hope about better cooperation between our countries. Unlike western European countries, most of our people can't just get over shit. I mostly blame the way our countries has been ruled after WW2.

[International Law on Water Rights](https://www.dawn.com/news/1293406)

&gt; International law provides a wealth of precedents on water use rights and obligations for both upper and lower riparians. The customary international law for transboundary fresh water resources provide for equitable utilisation, the Madrid Declaration of 1911 says that the regime of rivers and lakes, contiguous or successive, could not be altered by one state to the detriment of a co-riparian without the consent of the other. This law was also an off-shoot of the same customary law.
&gt;
&gt;Similarly, the Article 2 of Declaration of Montevideo 1933 points that no state may, without the consent of the other riparian state, introduce into water courses of an international character, for industrial or agricultural exploitation of their waters, any alterations which may prove injurious to other interested states.
&gt;
&gt;Article 4, Chapter 2 of Helsinki Rules 1966 on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers‚Äô, adopted by the International Law Association, insists that, ‚ÄúEach basin State is entitled, within its territory, to a reasonable and equitable share in the beneficial uses of the waters of an international drainage basin‚Äù.
&gt;
&gt;UN Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses adopted by General Assembly on May 21, 1997, is the treaty governing shared freshwater resources and is universally applicable to all member states.
&gt;
&gt;UN Convention contains 37 articles arranged in seven parts. Yet Article 5, contained in Part II, reflects the principle that is widely regarded as the cornerstone of the Convention, and indeed the law in the field for equitable and reasonable utilisation and participation. It requires that a State sharing an international watercourse with other States utilise the watercourse, in its territory, in a manner that is equitable and reasonable vis-√†-vis the other States sharing it.
&gt;
&gt;With the UN Convention having been ratified by 36 states ‚Äì after 17 years of adoption by the UN General Assembly ‚Äì it has entered into force on August 17, 2014. While the majority of the countries have opted to remain outside its scope for now, the convention, however, establishes an important international law governing cross border watercourses declaring water rights of all riparians as sacrosanct and non-violable.
&gt;
&gt;The customary international law, declarations, Helsinki rules and UN convention on the subject establishes two important principles for all river basins: one, that the first right over the water of the rivers is that of the people living in the basin, and the second that the shared waters could neither be stopped nor diverted without the consent of the other riparian state.

1. I meant Turkish in nationality. If my Greek grandparents hadn't left Turkey, I would have been born a Turk, not a Greek. Probably still Rum, but with a Turkish passport.   
2. I am Greek Anatolian. I have 0% Turkic DNA (as is true for most modern Turks, which typically carry 10x more Greek DNA than Turkic).  
3. Kasterlorizo would typically NOT get the full EEZ the Greeks claim. The Greek claim is based on the **maximum** allowed under international law. If Greece and Turkey were to go to court, Kastelorizo would receive a smaller EEZ, but it would still receive an EEZ. The concern with Turkey is not that Turkey disagrees with our EEZ math, so did Italy for example but we figured it out. It's that Turkey has chosen to ignore ALL international law on the subject because it didn't like it.   
4. Greeks knew Istanbul was a lost cause. Even if given to us, the Turks would do everything possible to take it back. Smyrna was not the same situation.   


Bonus 5. Don't cut us short; we have different religions, languages, many wars, and even current issues. All the European nations that get along today have similar languages and religions.

What are you talking about? The last 10 days? That sort of ignores the fact that Sweden has a much higher mortality rate over the course of the pandemic. 78166 cases and 5646 deaths according to the link you provided. That's closer to a 7% mortality rate. 

All the last 10 days shows is that Sweden is starting to get the pandemic under control for the time being, something a lot of other countries have already done anyway. So why would Sweden be singled out? It also ignores the possibility of a second wave in Sweden, which is entirely possible and something we've seen in countries that have been far more successful in dealing with it than Sweden has been. 

Saying that Sweden has done well in the last 10 days and ignoring everything else that has happened strikes me as disingenuous.

&gt;Infrastructure and industrialization bring wealth. Or you will have a huge beef with a lot of economists.

Your first statement is exactly what I said. Hence I do not understand what you intend by your second statement. **Infrastructure building and industrialization in the Netherlands was massively aided by cheap inputs from the colonies.**

&gt;Europe was already largely ahead of the world before the colonization started.

The industrial revolution in Western Europe was fed by raw materials from the colonies. The mainstream of professional historians categorically agrees on that point.

Portugal and Spain had colonies that started *before* the industrial revolution. The VOC itself started in the 1600s.

Rich countries donate very little. Much less than they try to profit from the labor of the poor.

&gt;While it still affects the present a different netherlands (and a different western europe.) came out of the second world war. We can in a lot of way reasonably predict the future and think and talk about what will happen in the next coming years.

Of course, but **denying that colonialism played a crucial role in feeding the industrial revolution and development of Western Europe is patently absurd from a historical perspective**.

We all have to live with who we are and recognize historical truth for what it is.

The current dutch republic is rich because it is productive and uses it resources correctly.

5601,"&gt;What would be then your only possible option? Defanging or destruction of Turkey? Or passive snubbing of Turkey?

Prevention of exploitation of our EEZ by Turkey, attempting to exploit it ourselves perhaps with other players in the picture. Framing it as wanting the destruction of Turkey is insincere and an attempt to make non-compromise appear ridiculous.


&gt;Being it possible or not, wouldn't it be better for both to find a different solution?

It depends on the solution, you accuse me of being an absolutist but you claim that any solution would be better. 

&gt;And to find that solution, dialogue and compromise should become possible, if it isn't currently.

Pardon me but do you think this is either the first time our relations with Turkey have deteriorated? Or that dialogue has not been tried? 

What do you think Turkey will compromise down to from:

1) Greek islands do not have any EEZ.
2) Greek territorial waters cannot extend to 12nmi despite UNCLOS. Under official threat of war, vetoed by Turkish parliament.
3) Cyprus has no EEZ at all, it also gets 6nmi of territorial waters and that's it.
4) Imia is Turkish. 

What would be Greece's benefit after this compromise? Will it be able to downsize it's military? Who guarantees Turkey will not press for more afterwards? After all we tried dialogue after 1996 and Imia, Turkey is now pressing for what they really want, I would not say it worked. 

On the other hand why would Turkey compromise? Threat of violence has been working for them the past 2 decades. Their leader is an islamist nationalist (not in the secular Nationalist sense of the Turkish politics but very much stil a nationalist, just a religious one). The previous situation, the normal, was nationalist, propped by military coups.

5706,"&gt;As a consequence of their actions the path of the UK is quite bleak which is pretty depressing for the rest of us who have to live there.

The path is bleak in your eyes. In their eyes an oppressive regime has been removed. Here I was thinking humans can't see the future, but you seem to prove me wrong.

&gt;I don't know where you thought I said that they shouldn't have a voice or vote, because I didn't. I can call them out on their fucking bollocks however.

No, you didn't say it directly, that is absolutely true, but in your first post you do say this:

&gt;Brexit is a symptom of the fact that a too large a portion of our population is uneducated and lacks any form of critical thinking. Another symptom is the utter clowns we have for a government.

In our society, education is a big and important thing. Uneducated people are regarded as being less valuable towards society, more prone to mistakes and less rational decision making.

While you are not making a big statement here, in the way you are writing it's obvious that you are taking a superior position because of your education to those that didn't. By claiming Brexit to be the wrong decision and them making the decision, you are making the statement ""They made the wrong decision"".

The point being, is that there is no right or wrong decision in this context. You can't make a statement after 1 year that leaving the EU was a mistake.

Imagine both of us had a talk before the EU was created, and me being heavily against it. 1 Year later we can see that all that we did is waste money without anything to show for it. Would you argue it to be a mistake, or would you argue that problems and projects on that scale cannot be measured before we are several years ahead in the future.

Also, by pointing out that most brexit voters are 'uneducated' you are undermining the strength of said argument.

And while its fine to do that, imagine if you did the same thing to anything related to race.

""Most people who worship X are uneducated""""Most people who are X are uneducated""

By stating these things you are creating a situation in which people will be more likely to see said people as stupid and therefore their opinions as less valid. Or even more likely to face strife because of those comments.As a reason, saying those things is generally frowned upon, even if they are backed up by facts.",,/r/europe/comments/hv0a7w/breaking_during_day_5_of_the_eu_council_summit_a/fys55eb/,Vlad_TheInhalerr,1595350384

5777,"Not as simple as that. Inflation isn't always a bad thing.  
Currency values these days usually have a portion of their value reliant on the economic prosperity of the issuing nation(s), and quite often this is further amplified by speculation and investments markets.  
If an economy drops off a cliff (e.g. like it has in recent months), businesses start failing, so you need stimulus funding to get the wheels turning again - this only works though if you have the free cash available to invest that stimulus.  
So while you *are* devaluing the currency, you're also stimulating economic growth, and so the ""money printer go brrr"" doesn't have a negative effect so long as the rate of currency depreciation never exceeds the rate of economic growth.  


The alternative is to let the current economy choke - I guess you could analogize it as a water pump circuit - suppose you have a feeder system that's meant to circulate nutrients through, say, an aquaponics bed. If the pump (businesses) is struggling, and there's not enough water (cash) in the circuit to keep the pump immersed, the circulation slows and the flow potentially stagnates (economic slowdown and potential collapse), not to mention a possibility of damage to the pump (businesses going bankrupt).   
Instead, you add more water to the system - sure, the nutrients are diluted and the plants in the aquaponics bed won't be receiving as many nutrients per litre as before, but the flow is maintained, and that's the important thing.  
The analogy stretches it a bit, but there's sufficient parallels that it's an okay metaphor.

Croatia has Istria with Italian minority but I don't think there is a movement there. Serbia has a muslim (of Turkish origin?) enclave of Sandzak in the south, but again, no movement or autonomy.
Macedonia has a significan Albanian population in the west of the country that might be encouraged by the success in Kosovo and seek independance.

Even if we only look from 1990-2007 (generally good years around the world), the story doesn't change (the deficit averages to about -5% though, but the economic growth wasn't much better).

So while you are correct in the ""if"" scenario... that ""if"" scenario never happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: one of things that one should also consider is inflation (to which previous debts may or may not be corrected) and the fact that growth is compound, whereas a deficit is not. 

As an example: Let's assume your economy is 1 trillion euros.Then, if for ten years there's a deficit of 10%, with 0% growth, then ten years of the opposite (0% deficit and 10% growth) - in the case of no inflation/interest rate that would result in good situation for the country because the growth compounds. Your debt will be 1 trillion euros (10% \* 10 years = 100%). Meanwhile after those ten years of growth, your economy grew to 2.59x its original size (so 2.6 trillion euros). Then your debt would only be 39% of your GDP: not that bad.

5912,"I'll try to give a serious reply for once.

For start this way of reasoning could work toward a child, not a state.

No country wants to live off depending on continuous northern european charity - and I may add that in the case of Italy is even pretty disrespectful from you folks to claim that.

Italy was among the founders of this union and always a net contributor of its finances, and NEVER before it happened that it asked for direct financial help form the other members.

The Italian economy is struggling since the last 30 years due to a failure to efficiently modernize a manufacturer economy in a tertiary based one + a never solved disparity between the southern and the northern part of the country + on top a huge public dept irresponsibly accumulated in the '80 thinking that everything would have keept doing great in the future.

Regardless this Italy menaged to keep the situation under control, and before that shit show of the 2008 crisis was even lowering it's debt  - all while never asking any direct financial aid but keeping being a net contributor.

Until a freaking pandemic catched the whole europe off guard, and Italy has been so lucky to be the first at being hardly hit.

It's whole economy had to stop for two months in order to contain it (and if you want to point out that was an inconsiderate move that's all another discussion).

Now you could say:""What all this does even mean? It's obviously your fault for not having being able to solve all your internal problems and kept being competitive in the world market"".

No shit Sherlock.

But right know our economies are pretty interconnected and if we go down the whole union will take an hard hit.

You could either consider showing some help to a partner who have never asked you a cent before, or decide to give credit to whatever stereotype about lazy peoples that wants to live off your moneys and jeopardize all the work we put in this EU of ours.",Sardinia,/r/europe/comments/hv0a7w/breaking_during_day_5_of_the_eu_council_summit_a/fyregp3/,sharden_warrior,1595336022
