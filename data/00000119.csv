40,"&gt;Yep, a small difference, just another 500+ km of border to defend (with no fortifications).

At no point was Poland willing to conduct a full-scale invasion of Czechoslovakia, so this is a moot point.

&gt;Yeah right, military equipment of Czechoslovak army and intact industry of ex-Czechoslovakia did not help Germany in any way.

But Germany would take it over either way.

&gt;Yet everyone knew of Hitler's plans of Lebensraum.

Hitler plans could be modified if the situation demanded it. Best example: despite Hitler claiming that he wants to unify all Germans within Germany, he left the Tirol German speakers in Italy, because strategic considerations of an alliance with Italy were deemed more important to him.

Likewise, if Poland was actually willing to ally closely with Germany, its experience in fighting Soviets and additional several dozens divisions could be valuable to Germany on the eastern front, and the Lebensraum plans would have to be reevaluated. Poland refused to cooperate with Germany though, so they proceeded with invasion (which, according to some sources, wasn't the plan Hitler actually wanted to implement initially).

&gt;Because Germany, a nation of 60+ milion with Nazis in charge was a much bigger threat than Czechoslovakia, a democratic country of 10 milion? 

In hindsight, sure. But if you looked at the 20 years preceding 1938, it was clear that Czechoslovakia was much more hostile to Poland than Germany during that period.

&gt;Poles also invaded territories in Northern Slovakia bud.

And they were even more significant than Zaolzie, like two or three villages. Also, Slovakia was a third invader of Poland in 1939, and not only took it back, but also annexed additional Polish territory, so we are more than even in that regard.

&gt;Anyway, if i ignore these things for the sake of the argument, Soviets taking Eastern Poland is literally the same thing as Poles taking Zaolzie.

No, if Poland annexed the entire Slovakia, and parts of Czech Silesia and Moravia, *then* it would be literally the same as Soviet Union annexing 51% of pre-war Polish territory in 1939.

Especially the French-speaking Christian Democrats were opposed. ""Why change?"", asked Melchior Wathelet (CDH) at the start of the Council of Ministers today, ""that's a good question that could be asked"".

&gt;According to Prime Minister Yves Leterme (CD&amp;V), road safety had to take precedence. ""With the current license plates, that's a problem. The contrast between white and red is not strong enough for modern technology."" Also the advice of the police, who carried out a comparative study, was negative for the red and white plates.

110,"Greece also supported the GNA until the GNA decided to sign an agreement that is seen as illegal and has been rejected by the rest of the EU. This shows that being the recognized govenrment does not make you the good guy and recognition can shift so your position that Turkey is the good guy is not really stable. If the EU, the USA and others changed stance and recognized Haftar tomorrow because of the GNA's fuck-up, then Haftar will be the good guy cause he's recognized, right? It's more complicated than you make it seem.

One can argue that Turkey is supporting the government in order to support an illegal agreement so in that sense Turkey is not the good guy. Greece also theoretically supports the GNA but the GNA's actions have forced Greece to turn to its opposition (personally i have no sympathies for Haftar but if the GNA is choosing to give Greece the middle finger, that's on them, not on Greece). It's not a ""good vs bad"" case and the fact that the EU doesn't approve of Turkey's actions doesn't say anything about how democratic it is because the EU knows that Turkey is not doing what it's doing in the name of democracy either (as you just admitted above), so portraying it as ""the EU is opposing Turkey trying to help the official government"", is inaccuate. The EU is opposing Turkey trying to support its agenda.

359,"&gt;Joining the party at that time had little to do with supporting the ideals, to achieve certain things one had to be a member of the party. To put it simply, their own personal ambition lead them to join the party, not a full-hearted belief in the system, many didn't believe in the system.

&gt;We had armed resistance until 1963, maybe not on a scale you would like but this is a time just after ww2 where a lot of our fighting age population was killed and where the people who rose up against the Nazi occupation(Warsaw uprising) were being killed by the Soviet regime. After that resistance to the authoritarian regime was mostly non-violent, which ultimately ended up in Poland being the first Eastern bloc country to gain its freedom(using civil resistance). In fact the only satellite state that had to use violent means to gain its freedom was Romania. 

The almost non-existent scale of it proves that the population wasn't really against the system, compared to the Nazi one. Unlike what the ""both sides"" narrative attempts to claim. And the non-violent resistance finally worked when the system was apparent that it could not provide what the citizens demanded, which is the case with any regime in history, feudal, democratic or totalitarian. Nothing to do with its allegedly ""natural evil nature"", all having to do with its pragmatic results.

&gt;Why would the Polish people willingly choose to bow to an occupier who had its own share of war crimes in Poland(killing of officers and intelligentsia, rapes etc.).

Because the actual ""Polish people"" didn't give a fuck about the few thousands of their establishment getting their comeuppance. They did give a fuck about the rapes indeed happening to them, the common folk, but even those wasn't enough to neutralize the literal centuries of getting fucked under the direct continuation of their own *ancien regime*, tracing its roots all the way back to the feudal age.

&gt;Why would they do this when they chose not to just over 20 years earlier in the Polish-Soviet war, where one of the reasons the Soviets lost was because they believed the Poles would rise up in support of them.

The Polish-Soviet War that was won due to the last minute support of the monarchical/oligarchical/colonial western regimes, because of course their regressive ass was on the line in case of a win of the other camp, just like it was the case when previous revolutions driven bottom-up by the people prevailed in other countries?

&gt;Want to know what a popular revolution is? 1989 was a popular revolution, it started as worker's strikes, most notably the Gdańsk shipyard strikes. This sounds more like a popular revolution to me than whatever the Soviets were doing in 1945.

Just because the 1989 was a popular one, doesn't negate the fact that the post-WW2 and the early 20th century ones were revolutions too. Popular allegiances do change over time and will continue to do so, unlike of the post-1990 dream of permanently stopping the clock over to the pro-capitalist, neoliberal, fuck-the-poorest right-wing consensus.

And since you mentioned the class of workers, you mean the same workers that were the bulwark of the earlier revolutions, disappointed over the course of decades, with the inability of the system to provide? Funny how the same class of ""heroic workers"" in Romania, saw behind the ruse and what the revolution would mean to their future, and they stood for the system. And for that grand crime (their action being a practical refusalto give legitimacy to the ""popular uprising"" narrative) they face court persecution to this very day.

&gt;edit: also I didn't grow up in Poland and neither have I gone to school there, so I don't know how I am being affected by this ""rewriting of history"", and I also do not support PiS or any other far-right party in Poland.

Because a rewriting of history anywhere affects everyone in the world, especially the neighboring countries. I bet if it was the communists doing the rewriting you would be up in arms screaming about ""1984"", but since it's the coalition of the oligarchs, self-described ""democratic"" centre-right up to the far-right doing the same, it's perfectly fine.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/ela9ji/chess_legend_kasparov_says_there_is_no_doubt/fdjcmsk/,txapollo342,1578465403

362,"&gt; Foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy held emergency talks on Iran and Libya in Brussels on Tuesday (7 January), as the EU continued struggling to find a united response to the two escalating crises in its neighbourhood.

-

&gt;“Libya has long since become a place for a war of proxies and we don’t want to accept that any longer,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters as he arrived for the start of the talks.
&gt;
&gt;On the same page, Di Maio said after the talks that there are countries interfering with the civil war in Libya, turning it into a proxy war, but he declined to answer whether he is going to address the issue of external interference at a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Tuesday evening.

[Haftar's attack on Tripoli deepens Italy-France dispute](https://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/haftars-attack-tripoli-deepens-italy-france-dispute)

&gt;The Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said he won't sit and watch if there are some parties using war to gain benefits from Libya.
&gt;
&gt;Salvini's remarks came Thursday in response to news about France's support for Khalifa Haftar in his attack on Tripoli.
&gt;
&gt;He added that it's a matter of hours for Italy to know whether France is backing one of the fighting sides in Libya, saying he is being updated about the shelling, attacks on airports and the perils faced by Italian workers in Libya.
&gt;
&gt;""If there are some parties trying to use games with us, then they have chosen the wrong government and the wrong minister."" Salvini remarked.
&gt;
&gt;Diplomatic sources told Reuters Wednesday that France blocked a European Union's statement that demands Khalifa Haftar stop his offensive on Tripoli immediately.
&gt;
&gt;The sources added that the proposed statement would have assured that Haftar's attack endangers civilian lives.
&gt;
&gt;The France-blocked EU statement says also that the attack on Tripoli hinders the UN-led political process.
&gt;
&gt;The sources told Reuters that the EU will try to word a new text that would be approved by all member states.

I am happy that in general the world will hopefully move away from fossil fuel and that the US is now a net fossil fuel exporter not importer.  Thanks Trump.

As for islamic terror the pious view Western Culture as satan and satan is the force that lures the pious away from islam.  Radical islam wants to end Western Civilization.  

Iran has literally been calling for my death and the death of everyone I care about for 40 years.  They now want to develop the means to act on that threat.  that is unacceptable and the IA delayed them slightly but also paid them massive amount of money to fund terrorism and their nuke rogram and gave them a garunteed path towards a nuke.  That is unacceptable.  they have killed large numbers of Americans and have been sharply escalating lately.  they are currently launching missiles towards Americans as I type this.  I do not like saudi but I also do not see that from them.  

We are now free to take whatever steps are needed to stop Iran.  If we can do it with less violence thru sanctions fine.  If too many countries such as European countries want to virtue signal and undermine the sanctions then more extreme measures will be needed.  

I do not like the Saudis but they are not openly calling for our death or developing nukes.  I personally hope the Saudi royal family loses all of their money which would largely take them back off the world stage.  

Iran has a larger population and a more diverse economy and has been openly calling for our death for a long time.  I have no doubt that Saudi money gets poured into terrorism but at least they do not have anything like the Quds Force that openly exports islamic terror and they do not routinely, to include in their parliment  meetings, call for our death and burn our flag.

495,"A French author wrote for years about his predilection for children and continued to win acclaim. Now one of them has spoken out.

PARIS — The French writer Gabriel Matzneff never hid the fact that he engaged in sex with girls and boys in their early teens or even younger. He wrote countless books detailing his insatiable pursuits and appeared on television boasting about them. “Under 16 Years Old,” was the title of an early book that left no ambiguity.

Still, he never spent a day in jail for his actions or suffered any repercussion. Instead, he won acclaim again and again. Much of France’s literary and journalism elite celebrated him and his work for decades. Now 83, Mr. Matzneff was awarded a major literary prize in 2013 and, just two months ago, one of France’s most prestigious publishing houses published his latest work.

But the publication, last Thursday, of an account by one of his victims, Vanessa Springora, has suddenly fueled an intense debate in France over its historically lax attitude toward sex with minors. It has also shone a particularly harsh light on a period during which some of France’s leading literary figures and newspapers — names as big as Foucault, Sartre, Libération and Le Monde — aggressively promoted the practice as a form of human liberation, or at least defended it.

A day after the publication of Ms. Springora’s book, “Le Consentement,” or “Consent,” which sold out quickly at many Paris bookstores, the fallout continued. Prosecutors in Paris announced that after “analyzing” its contents, they had opened an investigation into the case and would also look for other victims in and out of France.

In France, it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15. But it is not automatically considered rape, unlike in countries with statutory rape laws where people who are underage are considered incapable of giving consent.

With changing attitudes toward sex and gender equality, France toughened laws against sex crimes in 2018 and also extended the statute of limitations for prosecution — raising it to 30 years, up from 20 years — allowing victims to press charges until the age of 48. The new law, which is not retroactive, would not apply in the case of Ms. Springora.

In the days leading up to its publication, her book, “Le Consentement,” had already compelled many in France to try uncomfortably to position themselves in the face of a problem that had never been hidden.

The former host of France’s most famous literary television program struggled to explain why he and other guests — except, tellingly, the only non-French invitee — laughed with good humor at Mr. Matzneff’s preferences for minors. Most of his longtime champions have remained silent, though a few still came to his defense, including the former book editor of Le Monde.

France’s culture minister, Franck Riester, said he supported Mr. Matzneff’s victims and announced that the government would review a writer’s allowance given to him — an abrupt shift in the government’s position. In 1995, long after Mr. Matzneff had written about his past, the minister of culture at the time awarded him the Order of Arts and Letters.

“All this information had been widely available, Matzneff’s contemporaries knew very well, and university studies had been conducted on these questions, but it’s taken a victim’s account to trigger this process,” said Anne-Claude Ambroise-Rendu, a historian and the author of “The History of Pedophilia.”

So far, however, Ms. Springora — now 47 and the head of the publishing company Julliard — is the only one of his victims to have spoken out. After hesitating for years, she told the French news media, she decided to break her silence after being outraged that a literary prize, the Renaudot, was awarded to Mr. Matzneff in 2013.

In “Le Consentement,” Ms. Springora recounts being seduced at the age of 14 by the famous writer, who was then in his 50s. Introduced to him by her own mother, Ms. Springora writes that she fell in love with Mr. Matzneff and became disenchanted only upon discovering writings in which he described relations with countless other girls and boys, including those he met on sex tours in Southeast Asia.

She also relates the depression and other psychological problems she suffered from the relationship, and the years it took her to recover.

“He was not a good man,” Ms. Springora writes. “He was in fact what we’re taught to dread since childhood: an ogre.”

In messages to Le Parisien, Mr. Matzneff wrote that the book’s reported contents were “unjust and excessive” and spoke of the “beauty of the love that we shared, Vanessa and I.”

And in a long, rambling letter addressed to Ms. Springora and published in L’Express on Thursday, he wrote that he would not read the book because “it would hurt him too much’’ and accused her of seeking to “harm” and “destroy him.”

Caught now in the crosscurrents of France’s changing attitudes toward sex, Mr. Matzneff is the product and longtime beneficiary of France’s May 68 movement, the social revolution started in 1968 by students and unions against France’s old order.

With the slogan, “It’s forbidden to forbid,” the movement rebelled against authority and fought against imperialism, capitalism, racism, sexism and homophobia. Some also argued for abolishing age-of-consent laws, saying that doing so would liberate children from the domination of their parents and allow them to be full, sexual beings.

Mr. Matzneff was one of the leading writers to advocate the legalization of sex with children. In “Les Moins de Seize Ans,’’ or “Under 16 Years Old,” he writes, “To sleep with a child, it’s a holy experience, a baptismal event, a sacred adventure.” First published in 1974, it was republished in 2005.

Thinkers on the left, like Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, spoke in defense of the practice, or came to the defense of men accused of engaging in sex with people below the age of consent in France.

Libération, the newspaper co-founded by Sartre, championed pedophiles as a discriminated minority and ran personal ads by adults seeking children for sex.

The newspaper ran “revolting” articles about pedophilia into the 1980s, and its staff included activists who fought for the right to engage in “sexual relations with children,” its editor, Laurent Joffrin, acknowledged in an editorial this week, adding that the publication now opposed the practice.

Tolerance of it was not limited to the left.

For years, though less aggressive than Libération, Le Monde, the centrist newspaper, published a weekly column by Mr. Matzneff and articles defending those accused of having sex with underage partners, including one in 1977 that was signed by Sartre, de Beauvoir and Barthes. While the right attacked pedophiles, some of its leaders were close to Mr. Matzneff.

Pierre Verdrager, a sociologist and author of “L’Enfant Interdit,” or “Forbidden Child,” a book on the politics surrounding pedophilia in the 1970s, said that what united its defenders was the belief that France had an “aristocracy” that was not bound to ordinary norms of conduct.

While the ordinary French appeared revolted by the apologists, writers were considered part of this elite and were even expected to engage in acts of moral transgression, Mr. Verdrager said.

“There was an aristocracy of sexuality, an elite that was united in putting forth new attitudes and behavior toward sex,” Mr. Verdrager said. “And they were also grounded in an extreme prejudice toward ordinary people, whom they regarded as idiots and fools.”

Among Mr. Matzneff’s longtime supporters, a few, like Josyane Savigneau, the former book editor of Le Monde, have defended him in public. “The witch hunt continues,” she wrote on Twitter.

Bernard Pivot, who invited Mr. Matzneff several times on his televised literary show, “Apostrophes,” said that back in the 1980s “literature was more important than morality.”

“We are all the intellectual and moral products of a country and especially of a time,” he said, adding that he regretted lacking the “words that were needed” in interviewing Mr. Matzneff.

In one program in 1990, the one guest to criticize Mr. Matzneff was the only foreigner present, Denise Bombardier, a Canadian writer, who called the writer “pathetic” and his writing “boring.”

“Right now,” she said after listening to the host and other guests talk playfully and joke with Mr. Matzneff about his preference for underage girls, “I feel as if I’m on another planet.”",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/elnzk7/a_victims_account_fuels_a_reckoning_over_abuse_of/fdj670e/,Tark4,1578459563

501,"&gt; to have millions of registered members in its party supporting and running that system

Joining the party at that time had little to do with supporting the ideals, to achieve certain things one had to be a member of the party. To put it simply, their own personal ambition lead them to join the party, not a full-hearted belief in the system, many didn't believe in the system.

&gt;have no armed resistance movements continuously up until the collapse of that system

We had armed resistance until 1963, maybe not on a scale you would like but this is a time just after ww2 where a lot of our fighting age population was killed and where the people who rose up against the Nazi occupation(Warsaw uprising) were being killed by the Soviet regime. After that resistance to the authoritarian regime was mostly non-violent, which ultimately ended up in Poland being the first Eastern bloc country to gain its freedom(using civil resistance). In fact the only satellite state that had to use violent means to gain its freedom was Romania. 

Now I would like your explanation for why you think there was a popular revolution. Why would the Polish people willingly choose to bow to an occupier who had its own share of war crimes in Poland(killing of officers and intelligentsia, rapes etc.). Why would they do this when they chose not to just over 20 years earlier in the Polish-Soviet war, where one of the reasons the Soviets lost was because they believed the Poles would rise up in support of them. They did not, they rose up against the Soviets in occupied territories, and the Soviets lost the war. I will admit there were communist groups in Poland who supported the advancing Soviets, but that is far from a popular uprising.

Want to know what a popular revolution is? 1989 was a popular revolution, it started as worker's strikes, most notably the Gdańsk shipyard strikes. This sounds more like a popular revolution to me than whatever the Soviets were doing in 1945.

510,"Meh, it's such a weak quote.

Hitler and NSDAP were battled against. Thing with the battles is, you can lose them. Communists lost against Hitler and so did the socialists. So did the centre party and the national people's party...  Pretending there were no others vying to control Germany (or as the quotes puts it ""battling NSDAP/Nazism"") is simply idiotic.

There were plenty who ""battled"" them. And they all lost.  What should people do is look at why they lost. Why did so many people felt not represented by the other major parties and why did they feel like their issues were ignored by all other parties ? Perhaps because they were ? 

Between 1928 and 1930 NSDAP went from 2.5% of votes to 18.5%.  They achieved such major growth because voters felt that other parties were dishonest, they ignored their issues or issues they perceived to be important, or they were corrupt, or anything really. 

So battling them was never the issue, plenty of people did that. They just lost. And they lost through their own actions. If you can't get voters to vote for your party, that's on you.

Every single party between 1928 and 1930 elections lost voters. Only NSDAP and Communist party gained them. And the 1930 elections where Nazis went from 2.5 to 18.5% had the biggest turn out to that date 82%, so it wasn't the issue of ""only dedicated voters went out"". It's the issue of voters of others parties felt betrayed, felt their issues ignored, felt that their policies were wrong and they willing voted for NSDAP. 

As I said, there was a fight, a battle, between many parties. They just all lost. Due to their own actions, their own ignorance, their focus on what was perceived as wrong issues, in the end it doesn't matter for my point. NSDAP was ""battled against"" just the people who did it were utterly incompetent

To illustrate my point, making this quote is like saying ""well france should have just battled Germany"". They did, they just didn't do it well. That's not the germans fault.",🇮🇱 Израел 🇮🇱,/r/europe/comments/elkuco/how_dangerous_is_germanys_far_right/fdiq7z1/,ahwhatever11,1578448590

524,"No, I don't think that Azeris have such a visceral hatred of Armenians that they are friends with Turkey solely on that. What I meant was that Turkey is friends with Azerbaijan because Turkey is on bad terms with Armenia because of the whole genocide deal and as a result, it finds very common ground with Azerbaijan, which is on bad terms with Armenia because of a territorial dispute which has turned into a slow-burning low-level armed conflict. 

I suppose you can say it's a relationship due to mutual hatred, although it's a bit of an ugly way of putting it. Still, there is some truth to that statement. It's like Ukraine and Georgia being friends because y'know, Russia invaded both countries, so you can say the relationship is built on 'mutual hatred'.

&gt;Can you really not comprehend 2 states acting as one due to their friendship to one another? 

Correct, I cannot. 

De Gaulle said:

*No nation has friends only interests.*

Churchill said:

*We have no lasting friends, no lasting enemies, only lasting interests.*

Washington said:

*The Nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interests*.

I could go on. Statesmen of all periods have came to the same conclusion. Only nationalists masturbate to fantasies of brotherhood with similar ethnicities. In reality, human beings don't care which genetic markers one carries, proximity can often breed more contempt than amity.

Motive for many arrests is the definition of terrorism. In Turkey you can be prosecuted for ""helping a terrorist organisation without being a member"".

Said terrorist organisations usually are PKK (which is universaly recognized as a terrorist organisation. Turkey and other countries have conflicted ideas about it's connection to YPG in Syria) and Feto (which is more like a deep state and clearly evil. They were very influential in erdogans rise but a couple years ago they were purged by erdogan when their allience broke down)

At it's worst with this law anyone who had a similar view in any subject with one of these groups even if they are against the group in other subjects can be prosecuted.

This has been used to align kurdish journalists who argued for kurdish rights as members of pkk and secularist journalists who were against erdogan as members of Feto (which is absurd because its a religious group)

One other method for jailing journalists is the law against hurting the military. So you can't say anything that makes the military look bad.

According to Polish right-wing politicians, LGBT is responsible for the depravation of children. According to church hierarchs, for the collapse of the modern family. In turn, rapper Tau in non-heteronormative people sees the causes of fires that digest Australia. How does he argue?

Australia is burning and this is a definite tragedy. When everyone's eyes are focused on this part of the world, and help is being sent from everywhere to save as many people and suffering animals as possible - Polish representatives of the Church-related communities prophesy and find the root of the problem ... where it does not exist.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Ero,"" comments rapper Koza

&amp;#x200B;

An example of such behavior is the Polish rapper Tau. The musician in his work intensively refers to the teachings of the Catholic Church, and his social media is dominated by religious messages, photos of saints, and one of the main topics he deals with is abortion.

The man has published on his Facebook profile a film in which he explains why Australia was affected by such a disaster. ""*Again, the infamous, tragic, demonic world record was beaten, namely, last year 42 million children were killed in the wombs of mothers. 42 million children in the wombs of mothers were killed again. This is infinitely worse information than the forest in Australia is burning""* emphasizes the musician.

Tau will notice that liberal abortion laws apply in this region, and the situation of LGBT people is also good from a legal point of view. ""*Such cataclysms are the signs of the times, the consequences of sins. Remember that Australia has a terrible abortion law that allows you to kill a child up to the very moment of birth. In addition, Australia promotes LGBT and various ideologies that destroy human morality. So what they sown, now they collect* .

The words of the Christian rapper were widely heard, also in the rapper and rapper community. The musicians respond to the rapper and do not agree on this. He commented on Tau's words, among others Kali, claiming that this is a ""thesis worth considering"".

Rapper Regost, in turn, commented sharply: ""Since rapper Tau thinks that fires are the fault of legalizing abortion, t**he fact that the priest touched him when he was a child was the fault that his mother overslept the surgery**? **From what I know pride is one of the seven deadly sins in the religion that that idiot confesses.** **For the lack of humility and being with him, I doubt that if he dies he will go wherever he wants.

Krzysztof Bosak has already spoken many times about LGBT people. Now he admitted that a homosexual person could belong to the National Movement, provided he ""lived in purity."" Would the party management verify this somehow? According to a Confederate MP there would be no such need.

Confederate MP Krzysztof Bosak in an interview with Rzeczpospolita once again spoke about LGBT people.

To the remark that it is disturbing to insult people for traits they did not choose - such as disease, sexuality or skin color - Bosak replied: ""I have never postulated criticizing homosexual people for their inclinations. Our criticism relates to homosexual activity and movement LGBT, which seeks to change the morality, law, culture and language we speak about. ""

* they are **not** a neo-nazi party like NPD and fight those tendencies inside their own party

* there is no perspective of them coming to power on a national level, CDU will not do a coalition with them they prefer SPD (centre-left) and Greens

* there is no perspective of such a party getting a NSDAP like popularity boost and voting majority overtaking our democracy with the current German liberal democracy and also strong left and centre in Germany plus voters with immigrant background - overall society does not want to abandon liberal democracy contrary to 1930s

* there are some legitimate concerns regarding immigration, rule of law and EU/Euro critical positions as well as traditional conservative positions represented in the party which did not have sufficient representation in our democracy before or were abandoned by the left wing tilt of CDU under Merkel

776,"&gt;I guess we will have to agree to disagree, I do not see any harm in it and dont think its trying to predict it happening at all.

We'll have to disagree, but it's not the end of the world,

&gt;There is want and then there is reality. This silly question is the least of our worries.

It's a silly question, but I do think the idea can be important. After all these are supposed to be the bright minds of tomorrow.

EDIT: You're right that the question itself is not so important. I have to admit my objection is more on the school issuing the question and the students targeted than the question itself.

&gt;Where is the lying part exactly? No where in the question is there any  implication that the killings were unjustified, but you as the PM have  to somehow defend them.

Neither is there the implication that they were justified, just that one has to defend it.

&gt;From my experience, having controversial topics always made everyone  participate in the lesson. Feeling slightly uncomfortable isnt the end  of the world.

Of course, we had heavy topics, but that's a different matter. I'm not arguing about excluding controversial topics. In another comment I thought having a ""Devil's advocate"" situation with multiple positions would have been enlightening.

This is Eton college quoting the Prince:

&gt;*Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person,itis much safer  to be feared than loved,  when, of the two, either must be dispensed with.*

As part of the question on how to justify the military killing protesters, asked to students who will likely be in positions of authority makes my skin crawl.

&gt;Having to argue for something you were against was also a fun exercise (do you consider that lying?).

It is fun, however, arguing for something also requires, well, arguments. When I had to argue for mass surveillance for example I had time to research and to face push-back.

Tell me, you did say that this exercise required thinking up of excuses. What is the skill being tested here? Partly rhetoric, but also how one can play off or justify something without knowing the truth of the matter. What would you call it?

I do think a ""Devil's advocate"" exercise could have been interesting. What we have here on this thread is interesting. The question itself doesn't seem to have any nuance.

&gt;Then I can condemn the attempt to vilify it without details. Yes, thats  the whole point of the question, to explain (provide proof) why it was  moral.

Than I can assert that by trying to justify it as a moral by itself (without extenuating details), one is taking a definite position of the action itself being moral.

792,"&gt; [Look at this speech of Nasser's for instance..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4RK8bj2W0)

You'll need context to understand this clip, because it's really a rouze. 

Nasser was a pathological liar and a fascist. 

This video is an example of him lying.

The person Nasser is talking about here is *Hassan al-Hudaybi*, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. Al-Hudaybi wrote a famous book called ""*Preachers, Not Judges*"", where he argues that Egypt will benefit as a whole if she became more democratic and representative (pluralism really).  

Nasser believed in the opposite. One man. One rule. Him.


In 1954, Nasser had already moved against other popular politicians (Pres. Muhammad Naguib, Judge AbdelQader Ouda, etc.). Muslim Brotherhood was the last major straw that he saw as competition. 
He threw their members in prison without legal cause or representation, and had their leaders executed on his claims of treason. 

After getting rid of MB, Nasser would move on to other civilians and military soldiers. He even had his own right hand man arrested, the infamous torturer *Shams Badran* ([here’s Shams, sitting behind bars with 53 other military men, all accused of treason](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/former-egyptian-war-minister-shams-badran-is-flanked-by-news-photo/517775394#former-egyptian-war-minister-shams-badran-is-flanked-by-military-men-picture-id517775394)).

He kept this tactic going for years. By 1968, [Nasser claimed to have thwarted 3 assassination plots in 10 weeks](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19680725&amp;id=JTsgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8GUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7444,5617947&amp;hl=en), all from his own army. He would attack anyone he deemed to become more popular than him, fearing of losing his grip.

Sure, but out of how many students? Are you really saying the only thing they teach (or should teach) is how to be a good Prime Minister?

&gt;I disagree, I think too many politicians who understand little of how the economy works or of culture, but there's an increasing amount who are comfortable justifying bad actions.

You may disagree (and so do I), but thats the reality we are living in. Something like this is much more useful for a politician in our world, than things like arts, math (anything beyond the basics), etc.

&gt;Exactly. We don't know if there was a panic and people were trampled, or if the Army shot protesters similar to a Bloody Sunday scenario.

Or if these so called protesters attacked the soldiers and were killed by them. Exactly, we dont know and Im not going to assume like OP the worst scenario. 

&gt;It's just ""Army killed protesters"". So, in this neutral stance, I'm observing that you're falling automatically on the side of the Army.

Not at all, I side on the side that is in the right, depending on the hypothetical situation it can be either. I disagree with the wording of the question, IMHO the moment you ""attack public buildings"" you stop being just a protester, so we dont know if the army killed regular, peaceful protesters (indefensible) or the ""protesters"" that killed the police officers (might be defensible depending on specifics).

&gt;Addendum: Incidentally, you have assumed something. Nothing says how or what killed the policemen, no ""Protesters have killed policemen"", just that they attacked public buildings. We can assume, but there's no direct proof. That was still enough for you to a judgement on the hypothetical protesters. You **did** assume.

I misread that part as one sentence (protesters attacked public building, several policemen died), as if it was one event. In which case I think it would be fair to say the attacking protesters were the cause of the deaths. But you are right, its not specifically stated.

&gt;I can recognize debating techniques (hooray for education). This is a form of easing in, of trying to justify something unpalatable. Great use of brackets, de-legitimatize opposition groups.

No technique, just basic logic. What else can a government do if the police force cannot handle protests? I explained above why I used brackets, IMHO you stop being a regular protester when you become violent. 

&gt;""It was only logical to use the army, and if some people died, it's regrettable, but a natural consequence of the chaos"". That's the message.

Fundamental Islam has been around for a long time and there was an attempt by American conservatives to cast Islamic fundamentalists as violent but it didn't really stand up to reason because the numbers don't seem to support that.

So, around the Charlie Hebdo attacks there was the coining of the term 'radical Islam' to denote the specifically violent Islamists. Giving the conservatives a chance to, somewhat tautologically, argue that 'you can't say the violent Islamists aren't violent'.

881,"&gt; Sure, but out of how many students? Are you really saying the only thing  they teach (or should teach) is how to be a good Prime Minister? 

It's not as if they can all be Prime Ministers, but it's a location where connections are made. Some of the last few PMs knew each other in Eton and there's a high chance alumni will be in a position to influence politics. 

&gt;You may disagree (and so do I), but thats the reality we are living in. Something like this is much more useful for a politician in our world, than things like arts, math (anything beyond the basics), etc.

Only if we as a society make it so.

&gt;Or if these so called protesters attacked the soldiers and were killed by them. Exactly, we dont know and Im not going to assume like OP the worst scenario.

Yes, but without knowing any details one's instinct would be to try to find more details.
This exercise calls to defend and explain why this was ""*necessary* and *moral*"", with the given information.

&gt;Not at all, I side on the side that is in the right, depending on the hypothetical situation it can be either. I disagree with the wording of the question, IMHO the moment you ""attack public buildings"" you stop being just a protester, so we dont know if the army killed regular, peaceful protesters (indefensible) or the ""protesters"" that killed the police officers (might be defensible depending on specifics).

It could be vandalism, or it could be that they're shooting at buildings. Protesting isn't necessarily peaceful, the distinction with that and rioting is an thin one. We don't know the specifics, that is the point, and until more information is given one can't justify killing them*.

To give a modern example, if protesters in Hong Kong, Chile, Iran or anywhere else were killed under the excuse that they were attacking public buildings (which they were), what would you think of attempts to construe it as reasonable force?

&gt;I misread that part as one sentence (protesters attacked public building, several policemen died), as if it was one event.In which case I think it would be fair to say the attacking protesters were the cause of the deaths. But you are right, its not specifically stated.

To be fair it's heavily implied and at best they died because of the chaos of the protests. The problem is that we don't know. 

&gt;No technique, just basic logic. What else can a government do if the police force cannot handle protests? I explained above why I used brackets, IMHO you stop being a regular protester when you become violent.

Riot police? Talks? I don't know the severity of the situation there's not enough details. Having your troops kill citizens however tend to either completely kill movement, or cause revolutions. 

Sending for the army is a last case scenario.

&gt;And if that fits the hypothetical situation (not saying it does, just that it can), whats wrong with that message?

Only if it fits, it doesn't have to be for a government to claim that it did.",France,/r/europe/comments/elenc4/can_you_defend_the_indefensible_how_will_you/fdhpuyp/,frissio,1578427794

&gt; On Tuesday (7 January), the White House put forward a set of regulatory principles aimed at avoiding the overregulation of Nuclear technologies in the private sector. In a statement, the US said Nuclear regulation should not be pursued until risk assessment exercises and cost-benefit analyses have been carried out, adding that the government hopes its European counterparts would adopt a similar approach.

&gt; “Europe and our allies should avoid heavy-handed innovation-killing models, and instead consider a similar regulatory approach,” a statement from the White House read.

I will try to put it simply. I do not think Iran pre-revolution is a good example of ""progressiveness"" for two reasons:

1. The regime that sponsored progressiveness was propped up by the western power that was the UK and thus was not representative of the people. It was merely a convenient value to introduce, as an excuse for colonialising the noble savage.

Yes, Russia, a country that's quite a distance away and has a very different language and culture is the same as Serbia, a country right next to Croatia, that used to be in the same federation as Croatia, that speaks the same language is somehow the same as Serbia.

This is classic nationalism, us vs them. You imagine that there is a ""them"" (Serbia and Russia) vs us (Croatia) even though the difference between Croatia and Serbia is far smaller and a lot of these differences are easily changeable things (like religion, as opposed to geographic location or ethnicity). In time, if Serbia and Croatia weren't full of pricks like you, the two nations could become one, united and friendly.

All religions are shit, Islam nowadays seems worse but, it is like 1000 years younger, it grows at an exponential rate compared to other religions in the past and, we have tools that allows for mass manipulation {ie internet} that didn't exist back then....

Do you think Christianity wouldn't have used social networks to gather stupid followers? Etc etc


You just cannot look at the religions right now and say ""well this one is the worst"" and expect people to think you just said something intelligent.

There are people studying comparative religions, maybe you guys don't realize that it makes sense to apply some cultural/environmental bias when deciding which religion is the most violent but, that doesn't mean it's wrong.

Yeay Islam seems more violent, that's because we get to see all the shits fucking radical islamist do... Back then, a fucking priest could have gone and eradicated a whole village of black people just because they didn't want to convert and, nobody would bat an eye.


All in all, if you are capable of having a debate on religions and, if you are capable of basing your view on something more than ""some Muslim kills so Islam bad"" then yeay, please give your opinion and educate people. If you are not capable of seeing the bigger picture and understand how environmental issues have altered islamist countries' development {which is only one of the reason these countries are the way they are today} then, it is better you don't say anything.

It seems like anyone can insult Islam/Muslim these days because ""terrorism"".... Which is perfect for stupid racist people who now feel ""validated"" 

When you start really digging geopolitical and historical facts, you start to rezlize that religion is shit and, whatever false thing you believe in, they are all the same... Religion is used to control the masses and nothing more, all religion should be banned and, not one is worst than the others, all of them are shit.",,/r/europe/comments/el8j25/5_years_ago_today_the_offices_of_the_satirical/fdgzqw9/,Bighead7889,1578412222

Thats not what i'm saying. I'm saying that temperatures as low as  -5 (even lower actually)  can kill you if you can't keep yourself warm. But, as seen by Lithuania, this isn't the case because no +16% of lithuanians die off every winter. I pointed that out to show how ridiculous it is to claim that you die as soon as you can't heat your house, cause it's simply wrong.

But the only part that was picked out was the part where I said you can die at -5. Because for some reason, apparently nordics find it hard to believe that you can die at -5.

&gt;I would still rather be homeless in mainland europe than a nordic country.

Southern mainland europe, sure. I agree that i'd also rather be homeless in Portugal or Greece, the two warmest european countries, than in Austria.

1043,"The reason why I am less scared of right wing people is because we've already fought and won against them in countless western countries. Gay marriage for example has expanded rapidly in the west. The far right is also universally loathed so it is easy to call people to arms to fight against it. Politicians, intellectuals, journalists, activists, random people, everybody can declare themselves to be publicly and openly against the far right. It is even socially encouraged to do so. It doesn't require any courage to say ""I hate the far right and they are a danger"". So if we have to fight against the far right, everything and everyone is already prepared for it.

Now take Islam, it is very conservative and it is still ruling over dozens of countries and it is not only physically dangerous to criticise it, it can be social suicide. You can quickly be labelled a bigot/racist and be shunned from mainstream media and society for disrespecting it (I've been banned from subreddits like /r/unitedkingdom for being critical of Islam when I shared my experience as a gay man in a muslim country).

He wasn't Arab and he did not support socialism, so the Western powers backed him because he was willing to take a stand against communism and the Arab nations that were leaning socialist. His brutal SAVAK secret police was the proof that he was no progressive, there are many brutal secret police forces in the Middle East, but SAVAK and Mukhabarat of Syria were/are considered the worst in many ways. Not that you can be progressive and an autocratic monarch. Some autocrats do have progressive elements, but rarely actual monarchs these days, we are not in the Enlightenment monarchy days, by now we have much more progressive governments than monarchies championing Enlightenment values.


&gt;I will try to put it simply. I do not think Iran pre-revolution is a good example of ""progressiveness"" for two reasons:

&gt;The regime that sponsored progressiveness was propped up by the western power that was the UK and thus was not representative of the people. It was merely a convenient value to introduce, as an excuse for colonialising the noble savage.
&gt;The people suffered under this regime. It is just covered up by faux-progressiveness and pictures of women without hijab.

Again, I completely agree with you, particularly noting the last part, I can't stand how reddit posts a photo of hawt Iranian chicks being more undressed as somehow proof of Iran being nice before evil Mooslims took over. Those were a tiny amount of very wealthy women in the upscale parts of the biggest cities of Iran. They don't represent the country.

Suppressing religion isn't a good idea either. It just makes people want it more. But not supporting states that spread religious radicalism is good sense as well.

The death toll could be even higher given the level of Japan mobilization at this point in time. But yes, they could have chosen some remote area, the question is - would it work?

1132,"&gt; Multiculturalism is what created the greatest civilizations ever.

You don't understand what multiculturalism is. It's not borrowing stuff from other cultures, everyone does that. It's having separate ethnicities co-existing in the same place, which is mostly a recent development. England used to be almost 100% British a century ago, with everyone having English names, being white, christian and so on. Having Pakistani-British, Chinese-British, Romanian-British citizens and so on is a very recent development, especially in such huge numbers. This leads to all sorts of problems because people stick together with their own.

The US had similar issues with Irish immigrants, Italian etc. but eventually managed to create a new ethnicity, American (by which I mean white American), by homogenizing the white population. This is not happening anymore with the recent immigrants, and it's not clear whether it's going to ever happen because of the huge number of immigrants and huge difference between them (e.g. the differnce between an Irish Catholic and an Italian Catholic is very small compard to the difference between an Indian that does arranged marriages and a Muslim that wears a hijab).

I really doubt it can work out without a police state forcing people to behave, which is what we're seeing now in the West, the UK especially (arresting people over tweets and such).",,/r/europe/comments/el8j25/5_years_ago_today_the_offices_of_the_satirical/fdgps58/,bossdebossnr1,1578405096

Doubt it.

&gt; on the democratic party who control the parliament

We don't have a Parliament, we have a Congress with two chambers. 

Unlike in a parliamentary system our legislature has effectively zero direct authority over the executive branch. About the only real power they have is impeachment, which the Democrats are currently in the process of attempting but won't move it along to the upper chamber because the GOP has control there and without a significant majority of them it's dead on arrival.

The processes would be no different even if Trump ordered every air and naval asset in the area to strike Iran tomorrow, He wouldn't need their permission, wouldn't even need to formally declare war before or afterwards.

&gt; and on Nato

NATO has nothing to do with American actions taken in the Middle East, other than training missions which will probably be drawn down as a result.

&gt;  Possibly on the republican party too, considering that that party as well as Merkel are conservative.

1549,"TRANSLATION

For over a year, the country has been administered by a government with the support of barely a quarter of MPs. Is this still democracy?

Belgium is the first to accuse other EU countries of violating the rule of law and authoritarian tendencies. For two years, the kingdom has rejected Madrid's efforts to extradite the Catalan secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont, arguing that the Spanish judiciary does not guarantee a fair trial. Longtime Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, and today the leader of liberals in the European Parliament, regularly attacks Central European countries.

\- Hungary and Poland threaten with hard-won, democratic European values, thus undermining the essence of European integration. The sad reality is that if these countries were to apply for EU membership today, they would not be accepted - he stated in the international press.

FEAR OF DIVISION

**However, in Belgium alone, since December 2018, there has been a provisional government supported only by Francophone (MR) and Flemish (Open VLD) liberals and Christian Democrats from Flanders (CD-V), who after the May 2019 election have the support of only 38 deputies in 150-member parliament. This arrangement is not unusual in Europe for a short time. However, when a majority cannot be built within a certain period of time, early elections are usually called. For this reason, the Spaniards have elected MPs four times in the last four years.**

In Belgium, which already in 2010–2011 broke the world record for the lack of majority government (541 days), the king, however, is not calling early elections. Apparently he is afraid that they may lead to the collapse of the country. So a small minority rule is in full swing.

""We have the most serious constitutional crisis since World War II,"" says Edouard Delruelle, a professor of political science at the University of Liege.

The government broke up when the then Prime Minister Charles Michel announced that the country would join the so-called the Marrakesh Pact, a set of non-binding rules promoted by Barack Obama that should be respected for illegal immigrants. For this reason, the Flemish nationalist party N-VA, the largest party in parliament, unexpectedly left the government coalition. In this way, its chairman and also the mayor of Antwerp Bart De Wever wanted to stop the increase of support in Flanders for an even more extreme group - Vlaams Belang (VB).

However, this failed. In the election in May, VB tripled its result and from 18.5 percent. support and 18 deputies in parliament became the third force of the federal assembly. Part of the N-VA fell into the trap itself. The minister for migration in the federal government, Theo Francken, who came from this grouping, pursued such a radical policy towards strangers that he banalized racist slogans in the eyes of many Belgians. They finally recognized that voting for VB was not a compromise.

STALINISM IN WALONIA

Since then, the N-VA, which lost 7 percentage points in May, gaining 25% support, and with difficulty remaining the most important force of the country, it became more radicalized to stop the further outflow of the electorate. De Wever announced that he would not build a coalition with Walloon socialists (the country's second largest political force) because of too fundamental program differences (mainly a plan to expand social security, for which a wealthier than Wallonia Flanders would have to pay).

At the same time, the N-VA chairman of the Flemish regional government **Jan Jambon ordered that the Flanders parliament begin work on a project to transform Belgium into a confederation. It is a system in which Flanders and Wallonia are transforming into de facto sovereign countries and on their own initiative agree on a common policy in a very limited number of areas, such as foreign affairs or defense. Such a plan, which in practice liquidates Belgium as a state, is supported by other Flemish parties, although they do not necessarily want to implement it at an equally fast pace.**

The extreme fever that swept the Flemish (43 percent voted for nationalist parties), however, has its mirror image in Wallonia. Here, unexpectedly, the Belgian Working Party (PTB), one of the last Stalinist groups in Europe, doubled its result in the May elections. 13.7 percent voted for her. Walloons. Traditionally, the Socialist Party (PS, 26%) and the liberal MR (21%), dominating in this region of the country, lost 5 percentage points each, because another radical group - the Greens - also turned out to be a wave. To avoid further electoral departure from the PTB, the Walloon socialists do not want to give the impression that they are over-compromising with the Flemish right.

The collapse of Belgium would mean the first change of borders in a country belonging to the Union (apart from the unification of Germany). Such a dangerous precedent, however, de facto comes true during the interim government, because of necessity many of its competences are taken over by regions. In the absence of a new budget, the kingdom operates as part of monthly months corresponding to 1/12 of expenditure from around 2018.

This arrangement was headed by Charles Michel for many months. The politician declaring support for Emmanuel Macron was nevertheless pushed through by the French president as the new head of the European Council. His place was taken by Sophie Wilmes, the first woman in this position since the establishment of Belgium 190 years ago.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/el7mak/is_belgium_still_a_democracy_translation_in/fdg3d3c/,Tartyron,1578378486

1585,"&gt; (ahem WMDs)

Google chemical weapons found in Iraq.  We found thousands of chemical weapons and that was remnants of a much larger inventory that he had.  Saddam also had a history of extensively using them against Iran in the Iran-Iraq war and against Kurdish villages inside Iraq.  

Saddam repeatedly offered to destroy them and let inspectors verify that was happening.  In the end he did destroy most of them and said so.  However, he refused to let inspectors verify this as he had repeatedly promised to and had told endless lies and he was not believed.  Was the invasion based on bad info?  Yes, but I blame Saddam for that.

""lots and lots of more islamic terror not less""
Far more people died while Saddam was in power than have died since.  Agreed, Saddam was more secular about it but there has never been any shortage of islamic terror in the region since the day that a warlord created islam.  I guess if the guy torturing you to death or the guy firing the nerve gas shell that explodes over your head you can take comfort in it not being about religion.  Keep in mind that ISIS did everything it could to make sure everyone knew about their atrocities.  Saddam killed anyone that tried to get word out.  

The US does not want to go to war with Iran and Iran does not want to go to war with the US.  However, Iran has been calling for our death for generations and launching attacks and is trying to develop the means to act on their threat to kill America.  We are finally striking back.  If you did not denounce all of their aggression up to this point, I don't care about what you think about us returning the favor.  

Plenty of Germans were pro American in 1950.  During the war they went to extreme lengths to surrender to Americans instead of Soviets.  In 1950, Germans were still fleeing to the West, many German POWs stayed or returned to US and that was shortly after the Berlin Air LIft.  we also did not do the mass rape of German women or strip their land of anything of value like the Soviets did.  we are also what stood between them and the red army in 1950.  They understood what that meant.  Maybe the Germans of 2020 do not understand but the Germans of 1950 would have understood.  

As for China;  "" it spends that money going about building infra and helping out all the weaker states""
They are not building THEM anything.  They are building themselves stuff.  The locals will pay exorbitant loans not grants for the stuff or the Chinese will take ownership of the resources and facilities.

As for "" instead of getting there guns blazing and telling them whats what""
Try talking to Tibet, India, Taiwan and every neighbor especially those in the South China Sea.  

Americas neighbors do not try to defend themselves from America, they look to America to defend them.  The US/Canada border is the longest undefended border in the world.  

""If Americans wanted to “stabalize the region” and “end islamic terror” well what about huge investments in infrastructure, roads, schools, hospitals, irrigation systems etc, maybe even a mosque or two?

We have had islamic terror since the day that a warlord created islam.  we never said we would end it but we are trying to minimize it we are also building them facilities in the region.  Visit a girls school in Afghan and ask them how it was under the Taliban if you don't want to take my word for it.  

As for Steve Jobs I do not know or care, in my view he was an American.  One of my roomates in college grew up in Tehran and road his bike past what was the US embassy.

A senior Downing Street adviser in the run-up to the election was accused by Labour on Monday night of making “despicable” comments after he said Boris Johnson wanted to forge a “special relationship” with Viktor Orban, Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister.

Tim Montgomerie, Mr Johnson’s social justice adviser until last month’s election, praised Hungary’s “interesting early thinking” on “the limits of liberalism” and suggested the two prime ministers shared a populist agenda.

Mr Orban has been criticised by other EU leaders for undermining his country’s courts and media and for criticising minorities. He has referred to “Muslim invaders”, called migrants “poison”, and been accused of anti-Semitism.

But Mr Montgomerie, a former journalist brought into Downing Street in September, suggested Mr Orban was tapping into the same popular mood identified by Mr Johnson, Donald Trump and Brexit party leader Nigel Farage.

BuzzFeed News uncovered the remarks in a video of the event posted by the Danube Institute, the think-tank that hosted the event on December 17.

“Budapest and Hungary have been home, I think, for an awful lot of interesting early thinking on the limits of liberalism,” Mr Montgomerie said at an event in Budapest last month.

“I think it’s still consistent with traditional conservatism, I think we’re still the party that believes in the individual, but it’s a greater idea of individualism.

“It’s an idea of the individual where the individual prospers with good public services, strong family, strong community, a nation that sees them as the priority rather than perhaps an immigrant from abroad.”

Mr Montgomerie said that Mr Orban and his rightwing Fidesz party “have stated that the nation matters and that globalisation is often a threat to that”.

He added: “Why are people voting for Boris and Viktor and Nigel [Farage] and Donald? Those questions aren’t asked enough. And so whatever populism is, it isn’t really about any of the people on the stage, it is about long-term trends in economics and culture that are changing how people align themselves.”

Mr Montgomerie declined to comment, but last night Mr Johnson’s spokesman said the former newspaper columnist had not returned to his special adviser role since the election.

A government spokesperson said: “All special advisers are expected to comply with the special adviser code. During the election all special advisers resigned their positions. Tim Montgomerie has not currently returned to his position following the election.”

Mr Johnson’s team have not ruled out the possibility that Mr Montgomerie might resume some kind of advisory role, but his comments were condemned by Labour last night.

Jon Trickett, shadow cabinet office minister, said: “These comments from one of Boris Johnson’s senior advisers are despicable.

“Cosying up to a government which peddles anti-Semitic and Islamophobic rhetoric, attacks migrants and refugees and undermines judicial and media independence is unacceptable.”

Meanwhile, Mr Montgomerie also claimed that UK-EU trade talks over the next 12 months would leave Britain closely aligned to Brussels rules and regulations, against the wishes of Tory Eurosceptics.

Conceding that the issue was above his pay grade, he said: “I think there will be a large degree of alignment in economic sectors, and I think some Eurosceptics will be disappointed by that in the treaty that emerges from the next few months of negotiations.”",,/r/europe/comments/el63bh/boris_johnson_adviser_under_fire_for_praise_of/fdfub2i/,casualphilosopher1,1578370407

This  article goes into the background about how this zone came to be  created, as well as all the problems that came to be associated with it, as the scene grew to include thousands of addicts from the rest of Switzerland and Europe, as well as vicious drug-dealing mafias from Lebanon, Turkey and eastern Europe. Overdoses, crime and general mayhem came to be associated with the zone, which had many knock-on effects  for  the rest of the city. Eventually the authorities closed it down for a final time in 1995, at which point the Swiss had pioneered a new   approach of giving heroin addicts their fix under strictly controlled conditions.",Ami in Berlin,/r/europe/comments/el6g8k/city_of_zombies_zurich_summer_1991/fdfwn11/,DarkSideOfTheNuum,1578372216

Whatever you think of the 2003 invasion, we pulled out of Iraq in Dec, 2011.

We are there now because the current Iraqi government begged us to return.  Like I have said, islamic terror groups have existed since long before the US was ever created.  You can criticize some of the stuff we have done but I totally reject the aguement that anything ever happened in the life of any ISIS member much less all of them to justify the atrocities that they committed.  

I am not a neocon.  I am an independent that voted for a third party candidate, (Green Party if you are interested) because I could not stomach voting for either Trump or Hillary.  Trump offended me greatly and I thought he was too shady.  

However, after three years of literally daily hysterical rants from the democrats about how orange man is bad and a Russian puppet and worse than Hitler I am much more offended by them than Trump.  I still think he is crude and unflitered but after three years of intensive investigations turning up nothing of any substance he is less shady than I thought.  He has also turned out to be very good about focusing on results and keeping campaign promises and is good for the economy.  
From the democrats I hear nothing except orange man is bad, America is bad and we should treat illegal aliens better than American citizens.  It will not be hard choice this fall.  

By the way, one of my roomates in college grew up in Tehran and used to bicycle past the old US embassy.  I don't hate the Iranian people and understand that they have a limited voice in what their government does but like many of them I do hate their hardline leadership.  I do not hate muslims but I do hate islamic terror and anyone that tries to justify and defend it.  

Whatever that makes me in someone elses opinon fine but like 99+% of the worlds population I don't view myself as the bad guy here.

1665,"&gt; We are there now because the current Iraqi government begged us to return.

A puppet government your government set up to fail by forcing it to reject the Shia majority of Iraq, purging its military to smithers, just to have a regional ally against Iran. A puppet government which COLLAPSED at the sight of ISIS because of the way the US went about ""rebuilding its institutions"" after the war. 

A country that invited the US back in, right, due to the fact it is a puppet,  despite the fact that the US had LESS of an impact on the defeat of ISIS than did Soleimani, and the Iraqi Shia militias fighting in every frontal assaults against ISIS, or the Syrian Regime, while the US was funding Islamist al-quaeda groups in the ""Free Syrian Army"", and barely had any real impact on the defeat of ISIS other than perhaps in arming Rojava. 

A country which has now recognized its mistake and told your country to leave, that recognized the PMU/PMA as a legitimate heroic branch of its armed forces for its role against ISIS, a militia that the US has bombed repeatedly over the past month. 


&gt;I am not a neocon.

Your foreign policy is that of one: you excuse and justify American warmongering and imperialism.

1696,"&gt; A puppet government your government set up to fail by forcing it to reject the Shia majority of Iraq, purging its military to smithers, just to have a regional ally against Iran. A puppet government which COLLAPSED at the sight of ISIS because of the way the US went about ""rebuilding its institutions"" after the war.

It was a work in progress.  Look at Germany, Japan, Italy and Korea.  They all had repressive dictators like Saddam when we arrived and all are infinately better off now than before we came and none are puppets.  You are European, go ask Merkel if she is a pupet that must follow Trumps orders and get back to me with her response.  

However, we respect other people.  Russia is calling Crimea part of Russia.  That is an occupation.  China says Tibet is part of China. We never did that to Iraq or to any country.  
I think the Iraqies made a bad call when they asked us to leave but we respected it and left.  Just like we respected France and left when they asked us to leave at the height of the Cold War or the Phillipines asked us to leave in the early 1990's.  

If you think it was/is a puppet then why did it ask us to leave then and why is it possibly asking us to leave now?  

Solemani was a shite and fought ISIS not because it committed massive atroacites but because they were sunni.  Somemani himself was an islamic terrorist leader as was the guy he was meeting with when he died.

Political parties manipulate people’s disbelief in ballot secrecy. The mayors and employees of the local administration create and reinforce the expectation that they will know how people vote.

It started when Polish Gov passed IPN law(which penalized accusing Polish State and Polish Nation of responsibility for Holocaust, without proof).

Then media started shitstorm about it, using strawmans and clickbait titles as they do.

Here comes Israeli Gov to the stage. The law wasn't really as bad as media portrayed it, so they could simply say something along the lines ""We agree with intent behind the law, but we are concerned that in the future it can be abused so please can you work a bit more on it"" and if it didn't work they could always use daddy USA to lobby on their behalf(which they eventually did).

But Israeli Gov decided to go with ""Holocaust Denial"", ""Historical Revisionism"", ""Antisemitism"" etc.

The issue was eventually laid to rest and later Polish Gov tried to fix damaged relations by hosting Middle Easter Summit for Israel and USA(something EU was against). Summit went fine but at the end Netanyahu decided to remind everyone that ""some Poles collaborated with Germans"", which is true but maybe not the best time for such reminders considering that Poland was doing them a favor by hosting the Summit.

It put Polish Gov in bad light(they got a lot of shit about it from both sides of political spectrum in Poland) so Polish PM decided not to attend V4 summit(hosted in Israel) to save face, sending some lower bureaucrat instead.

This would be the end of it but then new Israeli Foreign Minister decided to share his thought about Polish Nation saying ""Poles suckle antisemitism with their mothers milk"".

The point is that SEXUALITY ALREADY IS A BIG DEAL in most countries and especially in Poland, and openly LGBT candidates are at a disadvantage **specifically because they're LGBT**

So the point of electing LGBT candidates isn't ""we should focus on sexuality"", the point is that we **already focus on sexuality** but we favor straight people, so the idea is to show we don't care about sexuality by electing someone even if they're LGBT.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/el0pws/robert_biedroń_the_first_openly_gay_mainstream/fdfk3d6/,Pineloko,1578363556

Usually, these people already have a job and a home and don't have any acute need to move and also they have very specific wishes where to live.

1816,"Very unlikely. The legal system is very bad at dealing with rape cases because... well... rape cases are hard to deal with. It's often she-said-he-said with little evidence. The defendant can and very often do claim they did have sex but it was consenual. 80% of rapes happen between people who know each other. 65% happen either in the victims house or the perpators. Most don't involve a weapon or visible injuries. Humans are complex and emotional and rape effects them in ways people(and the legal system is made up of people) don't think about. For instance victims often don't struggle much but instead freeze. Many victims also may have relationships with the perpetrator afterwards to try and make them feel like they have control. The system also hugely overestimates that women make false accusations. In a survey of US police over half said they thought 10-50% of accusations lied. Studies show in reality it's more like 2-8%, and the ones that are false are much less like actual rape (e.g. it was in public or it involved a weapon). People are much less likely to believe that good looking men committed rape than unattractive looking men. People are also much less likely to believe victims if the defendant is more powerful (e.g people are much less likely to believe that a cleaner was raped by a businessman). The most disbelieved victims are prostitutes, drug addicts and **teenagers** (pretty messed up). And so, even if the victims of rape, a horrifically distressing thing, were to report it immediately, which just isn't a realistic at all expectation, then the system would still fail to deal with thier cases properly.

1853,"When the use of a product or service generates an impact on others than the ones directly involved in its use (bystanders, society, the environment, etc), that impact is called ""externalities"" in economics.

A product or service that has a negative impact on others is said to have negative externalities (for example, gas being burned in cars polutes the environment and has a negative impact on the health of people who never used a drop of gas). 

In other words, the true ""cost"" of gas includes the cost paid by those indirectly impacted by it, not just the cost paid by who's buying gas at the pump.

To account for that, you need to tax products and services with negative externalities (such as gas, cigarettes, etc) to ""internalize"" the true costs. Similarly, you need to subsidize products and services with positive externalities (education, healthcare, etc.).

If you're not properly internalizing the true cost of a product with negative externalities, society is effectively subsidizing that product, even if it isn't directly putting money into it.

So, by not properly taxing gas usage, you're subsidizing it.

And that's before we get to the about $5B in annual subsidies that the US fossil fuel industry receives from the government. Also, tax exemptions **are** subsidies.

PS: Externalities are, IMHO, one of the most fundamental and important concepts of economics to the general public, along with supply/demand. Externalities are the reason governments pour trillions in education and research worldwide: due to the high cost but massive positive externalities of education and research, the full cost of research and education would rarely be fully recovered by those directly involved in it (because a lot of the benefit is to the whole of society through positive externalities).

1865,"&gt;Once Iran rightfully attacks in response, you will nuke Tehran

I doubt it, though technically our nuclear posture permits for it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_first_use#United_States

&gt;The United States has refused to adopt a no first use policy and says that it ""reserves the right to use"" nuclear weapons first in the case of conflict. The US doctrine for the use of nuclear weapons was revised most recently in the Nuclear Posture Review, released April 6, 2010.[33] The 2010 Nuclear Posture review reduces the role of U.S. nuclear weapons, ""The fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons, which will continue as long as nuclear weapons exist, is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners."" The U.S. doctrine also includes the following assurance to other states: ""The United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.""[33] 

Iran isn't compliant, but I suspect that use of nuclear weapons isn't necessary to resolve the issue.

&gt;and Europeans will be forced to accept it as a victory. 

If you want, you can mourn Iran not having nukes as a loss.

Yes but that wasn’t the third step

Together with the Soviet-Union at that time attempting to counter-counter-countercoup both the US and the Shi'a in an attempt to install the Communist party (guess what, that failed even more), the attempt by the US to oust the Shi'a government in Iran failed because of an critical lack of support.

Situation was like this, Poland and Czechoslovakia made deal about borders where territory that had polish majority would belong do Poland and same for Czechoslovakia, and you know what, that territory had polish majority so it was supposed to belong to Poland, problem is that Czechoslovakia realized they screwed up because that territory was important to their economy so they broken off the deal and told polish people to leave that territory, Poland said no and no long after when Poland was busy with its eastern border Czechoslovakia invaded and take territory by force while killing some polish people in the process, as you can imagine Poland wasnt happy about it but couldnt do anything about it because it was blocked by some of western countries, and eventually as you know when opurtunity presented itself they taken  this territory back...",,/r/europe/comments/ejqmdt/poland_rings_eu_alarm_after_russian_ww2_slurs/fdewc9p/,Culaio,1578347959

The Saudi state did not do 9/11.  Though I must say your comments certainly did a rapid 180 on the humanitarian rationales there.

&gt; Just, wow. Fucking wow. The US is the arms dealer of the world. The military industrial complex isn't a conspiracy theory, it's a real thing.

The US does not produce wars for the purposes of selling weapons.

&gt; raise oil prices

Historically, high oil prices have been disadvantageous to the US, as she's been a net oil importer, so you're really arguing against your point -- normally, the US has benefited from low oil prices.  At the very end of last year, the US *did* become a net oil exporter, but it's not on the net large.

Further, given the current situation with Russia, it's probably advantageous to the US to have low oil prices from a geopolitical standpoint.

&gt; Why WOULDN'T Iran want to get a gun? 

Because if Iran tries to acquire nuclear weapons, they will probably be clobbered for it.  As I said, the fact that we've had friction with them in the past isn't a pass to getting nuclear weapons.

To stay away from the nuclear business.  Out.  If Iran chooses to play in big, serious hard power field, she is going to be in the school of hard knocks.  There is no guarantee that countries can simply go out and obtain whatever hard power capabilities they want.

Incorrect. It wasn't legally recognised as rape, but it could still be prosecuted under a different title.

Also incorrect. Firstly, being gay was never illegal, only certain homosexual acts were. Secondly, even those were legalised in 1969. The only difference afterwards was that there was a different Age of Consent for homosexual acts.
&gt;Or look into the current debate about §219 StGB or the recently overturned laws on sanctioning social service receivers.

2048,"&gt; Anti-racist language of the 1970s has been similarly misappropriated for the EU migration debate. Activists challenged racist immigration policies 40 years ago to ensure the equal treatment of all British citizens. The debate today is the inverse of this. Now, the transient position of EU economic migrants, lacking in meaningful rights and status, is celebrated as a progressive model for all people. Migrants are increasingly valorised over citizens because they are living examples of ‘citizens of nowhere’. That is, they may live and work in a number of different countries, but they are an invisible presence when it comes to voting and popular pressure on government decision-making.

Jesus Christ, what fucking mental midget wrote this?  OP, did you think the article was impressive simply because the author used sweeping language and some three-syllable words? Because otherwise I can’t fathom how you’d find any merit in this. 

Free movement principles, particularly within the context of the EU, don’t undermine anyone’s citizenship; they enhance it. This is done because an EU migrant into another EU country is not on the same footing as a migrant from outside the EU. Why? Because in addition to having the citizenship of their homeland, that EU migrant also has citizenship in the EU, along with all attending rights that citizenship brings about. 

A country’s removal of itself from that system *because of its distaste for migrants* (a point about Brexit that is certainly debatable, but the author seems to assume it’s true because the whole piece is a defense of it) is absolutely nativist. It isn’t about protecting citizenship, and that citizenship already existed and continues to exist. What it is about is making sure you don’t have migrants with rights from a higher source coming into your country, because you somehow view that as a threat to your people. That is nativist.

* Second (and perhaps worse), he was in Iraq as a diplomat, apparently bringing the Iranian response to an Iraqi letter or something like that. Historically, killing diplomats has been a big taboo, maybe one of the eldest one.
* Finally, he seemed to be a quite influential member of the Iranian government and apparently appreciated as well, at least by some part of the population.

&gt; 
&gt; The US is in Iraq to help Iraq fight against ISIL.

Not hardly. They are there to protect their interests, nothing more. That fighting ISIL helps protect their interests is the only reason they are fighting ISIL. 

&gt; 
&gt; This, among other things, led to Isis.
&gt; 
&gt; You make it sound like the other things are just a sideplay.

They aren't. I could go on about how many of them are come from US backed groups, for example.

&gt; Ah yes, the dangerous Iranian dictatorship that shot down a civilian airplane (oops, that was the US).
&gt; 
&gt; You mean the 1988 event? The event, which the US clearly publicly interpreted as a mistake and compensated the families of the victims for? Are you sure this is entirely relevant in 2020?

The one they accepted no legal liability for nor issued any formal apology. Yeah, I think it is still relevant to the people of Iran. 

&gt; 
&gt; invaded multiple countries in the middle east (wait, no that was the US).
&gt; 
&gt; This is what always bothers me - people lumping very different conflicts together, which demonstrates immediately that they know very little of these conflicts.

What bothers me is that you don't see it as connected. Each conflict may have it's own reasons, but the reasons for US involvement have to do with their power in the region. Also, seeing each conflict as separate and unrelated seems simplistic if not naive. 

&gt; 
&gt; The dangerous Iranian dictatorship that meddles in affairs way outside their own region (US again).
&gt; 
&gt; What does the distance have to do with anything? Do you really think Iran has somehow more of a legitimacy to meddle in the affairs of Iraq than the US does?

Yes, it certainly does. They share a border, they share peoples, they share air, water. They are inherently intertwined more with each other than the US. Where does the US legitimacy to meddle in Iraq come from? The fictional WMDs? Or the outdated chemical weapons given to them by the US? No matter what right you think Iran has to meddle in Iraq, the US has less. 

&gt; 
&gt; the assumption that the US is always the good guy and thus nothing they do is wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; But it's clearly not always the good guy, but in the grand scheme of things, it most definitely is 

I don't agree at all. Post WW2 they definitely played a major peacekeeping role, which is vitally important for international shipping. This was not mere charity, the US dominance in trade and finance is directly linked to the role they assumed and they profited greatly. Meanwhile they set back democracy in any place outside of Europe and the US. They toppled democracies in favor of dictators, they set up the conditions for the conflicts currently playing out in the ME and South America. 

&gt; and most Internet-based criticism of US foreign policy usually ends up being simplistic a.f and clearly written by people, who either have a clear anti-US agenda or who don't understand much about geopolitics.

2252,"&gt;Canibal who walked free

This is a 40 years old case. I don't know in details how psychiatric troubles and their consequences were dealt with back then, and I won't comment about whether his release was justified or not (I genuinely don't have an opinion about it).

But while that kind of decision may --*very legitimately*-- seem crazy or revolting to most of us, it's not inherently wrong when you actually take the time to understand the rationale behind it. When it's justified, this is the equivalent of getting out of hospital after being treated for a contagious physical illness, and not being a threat to the public anymore.

Two relatives of mine are suffering from paranoid schizophrenia (and are now treated and living a normal life). One of them once stabbed a couple people, *including one of his best friends for 15 years*, during a psychotic breakout that gradually built up over the preceding 24 hours. He wasn't medicated back then (he now is, by law).

Noone sane just stab his best friend out of the blue for no reason. But severe psychosis is **completely** altering your perception of reality, it effectively makes you behave not just erratically, but like a *different person* altogether. That's precisely the reason it's called a mental **illness**. It's not a normal state of mind. 

And just like any other illness, once it gets properly treated, you're dealing --*most of the time*-- with someone normal. The extent of this ""normality"" is determined by doctors, and it takes time to determine whether someone can or cannot be safely released into society. And even after a full remission, serious cases keep being monitored anyway. You live with the consequences for the rest of your life, no matter what.

&amp;nbsp;

As for what will happen to this guy specifically, all cases are different, and he will be treated according to the specificities and evolution of his mental troubles. He'll be institutionalized for decades no matter what (a safety period of 20 years minimum was set, FYI), because of the seriousness of the case. He may be freed in a couple years, or he may be held in a mental hospital for the rest of his life. You and me both have literally no idea, because nobody here knows the details of his profile, and nobody knows how it will evolve.

One thing certain, is that the excerpts I've read about the behaviour of this guy in the hours/days preceding the murder have brutally hit me as a vivid reminder of the behaviour of that relative of mine. When you understand what lies beyond what seems to be just an unstable weirdness, you realize that it's a textbook example of a psychotic behaviour building up.",France,/r/europe/comments/ekobpt/thousands_march_in_france_to_protest_decision_to/fddxbm9/,Orravan_O,1578326250

How thick is the turf ? Or did you mean how deep are the bogs ? It's not sustainable at all, once the bogs are gone, they're gone forever (more or less).

We incur fines in Ireland from the EU for destroying our bogs with turf cutting but people still do it, it's either that or freeze because like I said, other means of heating houses are way too expensive.

2372,"&gt; I see you want to buy old town apartment for cheap or don't like that neighbouring house is not shiny and sterile so value of your real estate is lower.

Nice way to ignore my argument by claiming speculative thought with no reasoning. I can assure you, that I can't afford a flat in the center right now. 

But I can agree that I don't like old town houses that are not pretty and shiny. Simply because nice looking streets, just look better. 

&gt; Wealth and social gap is only growing 

Thats correct, but comming back to my original argument, holding real estate that you can't afford to keep does not help to ease the situation. 

The argument about differences between Vilnius and the rest of the country is correct, but irrelevant to my arguments or post topic. 

&gt; Lately, you can even see divide forming in Vilnius, younger generation with higher salaries try to cram themselves inside tiny apartments in city centre, while everyone else is forgotten and left aside (all workplaces are being created in the city centre, while infrastructure is not being improved, traffic jams are only increasing and some even want to limit access with personal transport, ""electric scooter or bicycle is more than enough).

Oh boy... One has to be blind if he does not see constant transport infrastructure changes, especially around Vilnius and inside the city. Everything from streets to busses is getting constantly upgraded. Argument that city periphery regions are forgotten does not hold true as even few years ago, a lot of streets got renovated in residential districts, just look outside the window.

And everyone wants to live in the city center, because its the best place to live, especially for young families. Plenty of attractions, good transport system with everything being easily reachable. Makes sense if you ask me.

Argument about transportation is also pointless to this discussion, but whatever. I will follow up on it. Any way you put it, its worse for all when everyone uses their own cars to drive to work. Everyone then is stuck in bigger traffic jams, pollutes more and the demand for parking spots increases. And parking spots are making the city more ugly and worse of in general, from hot islands to removed walkability of the city. For the city residents, there is also no benefit from commuters that decided to live outside of the city in their private gardens, but have to constantly drive to the city. They use services paid by city dwellers, but don't contribute to city taxes. And makes all city services less efficient in return. So the incentive for the city, to try to minimize car traffic is huge.",Lithuania (also mods = stink),/r/europe/comments/ekrmos/people_who_cannot_afford_to_keep_their_home/fddo4ti/,Penki-,1578319263

Looking at this paper we can immediately say that ""among the worst in the EU"" is clearly incorrect as the article only looks at 12 of the wealthiest countries in the EU. It doesn't include the many EU countries that the OP shows are worse or comparable. (e.g. Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary, Croatia, Ireland,  etc, etc)

And then among the cherry picked countries, we are only the worst at relative fuel poverty. I would also be interested to see which definitions they are using for fuel poverty because most definitions use a threshold percentage of household income being spent on heating to define it. That being the case it doesn't seem possible that, for example, Czechia spends nearly twice as much on fuel as a proportion of household income but this article claims that more people in the UK are in fuel poverty.

As for moldy and damp, the data they cite (living in a home in poor repair - however that is defined) puts us at above Belgium and Slovenia and comparable to Denmark and Luxembourg.

A more accurate assessment would be that the UK is in the bottom quarter of countries in the the top 12 EU countries with a LOT of caveats around the fuel poverty number.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ekrmos/people_who_cannot_afford_to_keep_their_home/fddo5zk/,jimmy17,1578319292

Modern names are misleading. The village where the castle is was renamed Vaasa (Vasa) by the king Gustav Vasa, but when it burned down in 1852 it was relocated, although the old site remained within city boundaries. In 1927, the Mustasaari council, which was majority Swedish, decided to steal the Swedish name Korsholm from the castle. Also, Mustasaari merged with four other municipalities in the 1970s, so there's a lot of land called ""Korsholm"" named after a castle in Vaasa.

Like for example the EU wanted to do ""hotspots"", that would mean camps where the immigrants would be recieved on the EU border (for example in Greece or Italy) and where there asylum request would then be processed. But because of inaction from the member states this didn't happen.

And the EU is now stepping up and reinforcing Frontex (e.g. [upping their budget](https://euobserver.com/tickers/145089) ) to make sure it can act faster in the future.

However it's also extremely touristy, I wouldn't recommend to visit it during the summer when the streets are filled with the entire Spanish population.

You can visit the castle itself and the city walls, I think it's free if you're from the EU and under a certain age, something like that, so we didn't have to pay (we were all under 22). I found it pretty cool, lots of information about the castle, when the different parts were built, and the city walls provide an amazing view of both the interior and the exterior. We spent about 1 hour going everywhere I think.

There was also the Musée de l'Inquisition, which was nice too I guess, it focuses on a specific part of the city's history, the visit felt a bit short for the price but if you're interested in history it's definitely for you.

Lastly, you can visit the Basilica, I also found it very beautiful.

That's what I recommend visiting if you ever plan to go there, very nice view and history in summary, but not much else to do really, a lot of shops for tourists, please don't buy their overpriced stuff :)

2747,"Governing traditions from where? What are you even talking about? By what right are you even spreading this baseless, overblown nonsense? Are you by any chance the supporter of the notion 'scratch a Russian find a Tartar'? That would make sense why you'd be spreading false notions like these, if only there were bans handed over for this poison you give out like that.

I can't deny that this didn't apply to Rus principalities later on after Kulikovo since these things tend to take time, but after Europeanization everything that was Old Russian was torn apart either immediately after Peter the Great or with the next emperors and empresses following. And nothing that resembled the vassal state and its governing system remained. 

&gt;""Absolute reverence to the head of state, who is the only embodiment and the source of power, indeed looks very much like a Oriental empire."" 

This has absolutely NOTHING to do with Asian influence whatsoever. This wasn't even how the nomadic powers worked, they weren't full-despot-authoritarian, almost never as these were tribal federations and not a dictatorship over all tribes by one Khan, the same goes for Scythians, Pechenegs/Cumans and the list goes on.

The absolutist notion comes from the synthesis of Orthodox Church and the autocratic powers - notion that was constantly turned On and Off depending on the Tsar or Tsaritsa that was in power and whether these were more traditionalist slavophiles or more modern zapadniks (although this is a generalization), and the notion that the Tsar is the holy power. THIS concept of absolutism, source of which is absolutely natural and Russia's own notion, remained. DURING and shortly AFTER the Mongols in Rus', there was no powerhungry, absolutistic dictatorship what you're describing until Ivan IV, and that's 1500s.

&gt; Not to mention multitude of words in Russian absorbed from Turk languages.

Yes, things like dengi, khoziain and the list goes on. But there aren't multitudes of them. These influences are indeed in part Mongol, in part Pecheneg or even Persian words, but 'multitude' is again overblowing it, simply because you see several TURKIC (not Turk, that's another wrong choice of words) words used in everyday life. Hell, even Polish-exclusive or Iranic lexis has a higher impact on Russian when it comes to number of borrowed lexems.

I've had enough with these baseless claims. Make sure to not star talking about topics you do not understand.

And in case you are Russian, and you claim you naturally know more than a Slovak, it doesn't really matter where you're from, but what have you been studying at accredited institutions, what are your researches and what factual information source you take these things from. Because almost everything you said was twisted and overblown, it means your sources are murky or tainted. Or these sources are your own mind.

Principality-based governments were outdated and sooner or later there would be someone unifying those lands, Mongols or not. Centralization was bound to happen. Although it does make sense what you wrote, that isn't entirely the case, they might have indirectly helped in the unification though.

It's not that Slavs lived there and learned to fight on horseback like that because of Mongol or Turkic influence, it's that Turkic peoples living in those steppes became mercenaries local governments used, then these governments tried to incorporate them and only Russia achieved that, as Cossacks turned on PLC.

Firstly, she posted pictures and commemorated the suicide of a convicted war criminal from the Bosnian war (Praljak), which is blatant degradation of her function, and greatly damages relations with Bosnia. And very immoral, of course. She backpeddalled, but it was too late.

Secondly she repeatedly stated that the fascist salute of the Croatian WWII quisling movement, the Ustashe, is a historical Croatian salute and shouldn’t be penalized. Of course, that greatly damaged efforts to expunge ustashophillic speech in Croatian society, and is historically innaccurate anyway. She backpeddalled on that as well, but it was too late. 

She is a Trump fangirl. Can’t stop singing his praises. Nuff said.

Her conduct on the football World Championship. She wore a jersey and kissed french and croatian players alike (all of them), kissed the Champion’s trophy (which Croatia didn’t win), and generally acted like an utter primitive, all the while standing beside Putin and Macron, both trying to maintain some dignity.

She kept undermining Croatian secret services and the intelligence agencies over a petty grudge she bore towards it’s leadership.

2924,"So this has been mapped in the middle of a civil war in Denmark called ""the Count's Feud"" (1534-1536), you can see each king, one in Jutland (Christian the III - protestant), the peninsula connected to Germany and one in what is today southern Sweden (Christian II - Catholic), but at the time eastern Denmark. The king to the left or west won the war and the crown.

Christian the III won the war, and with it the nobility gained much power that would last until 1665, [when the nobles didn't send forces to defend Denmark from Sweden and the Danish monarchs got absolute rule up until 1849 and our first democratic constitution]. The church and Danish noblemen had supported him, where as the German Hanse cities (free trade cities) had supported Christian the II, together with Copenhagen and Malmø. The common people supposably supported him too.

2958,"&gt;No one in 1957, even the most hardcore supporters, ever assumed it would one day become a political union which is why we've had a series of further treaties to cement those extensions of the EU and its powers.

You're quite simply wrong. People actively PLANNED for political union to happen. Economic union was seen as a step towards that. They knew perfectly well that political union was very, very difficult to achieve.

SCHUMAN:

&gt;This ***cooperation was to be designed in such a way*** as to create common interests between European countries which ***would lead to gradual political integration***, a condition for the pacification of relations between them: “***Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity***. The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany”.

[https://europa.eu/european-union/sites/europaeu/files/robert\_schuman\_en.pdf](https://europa.eu/european-union/sites/europaeu/files/robert_schuman_en.pdf)

It's late now, but if you want I can find you a ton more sources and quotes on this matter. Political union was a goal from the very beginning. They thought about how to achieve it, and concluded that, step by step, without radical constitutional reform or revolution, would be the way to go.

Whether the preamble to the Treaty of Rome was legally binding is irrelevant. But I think I can contest that point too, because it was the Treaty of Rome that introduced the institutional framework we have today: Parliament (or ""assembly""), Commission (or ""high executive"") and Council (for which I can't remember the old name).

And they didn't just randomly create those, they gave every subset of the union (Coal and Steel, Economic, Euratom) its own institutions, all following that pattern. Then they named them ""Communities"", the idea being that each of the communities would be one part of a larger union. Do you see where this is going?

2996,"&gt;Art. 285 Violence and threats against public authorities and public officials

&gt;1.1 Any person who by the use of violence or threats prevents an authority, one of its members or a public official from carrying out an official act, or coerces them to carry out such an act, or attacks them while they are carrying out such an act is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty.

Not quite sure how this is relevant when the conviction would entail a deportation and not a prison sentence or fine, furthermore, the law you're mentioning isn't the one the BBC article I linked refers to. An act or threat of violence is a crime, arguing with a police officer is a minor offence. And since the judiciary has a documented and systemic history of backing a cop's testimony over that of a private citizen (and in this case, not even a citizen but only legal resident), I have absolutely zero doubt that this law would have enabled police to harass non-citizens with impunity.",Austria,/r/europe/comments/ekcfo4/most_swiss_reject_farright_plan_to_end_free/fdc78ef/,Zyllber,1578268468

This back scratching agreement may or may not exist, Trump has seemed to say it does, while UK government officials have played it down to appease traditional conservatives.

If 25 years from now, Iran stupidly decides to cut off its main income source and refuses to sell its gas on the open market, and somehow the US is no longer a net gas exporter, why wouldn't the U.S. wait until then, and simply topple their government, and install a friendly one?

&gt; The second aspect is the lack of Russian backing as it has the highest gas reserves in the world and Iran could deteriorate their potential for future monopoly and price control.

If Russia doesn't back Iran, why is it literally backing Iran in all of its public statements?

&gt; The third part - these reserves are the main reason Iran is developing nuclear potential.

Why does having petroleum reserves necessitate having nuclear weapons?  Most countries with such reserves aren't nuclear powers, and still maintain their sovereignty.

3025,"In the picture there are 26 meteors belonging to the Quadrantid meteor shower. They were captured on the morning of Jan 4 2020 at Pulkkilanharju, in Southern Finland, couple hours before the predicted short peak of the shower. The backdrop consists of Milky Way; North America Nebula in Cygnus being most prominent. Constellation of Lyra with its brightest star Vega is in the upper right corner, constellation of Delphinus in the lower right.

To achieve the end result, over 750 photos were taken between 6:08 and 7:25 AM. Around 50 frames had captured a meteor.

The final picture is a two-part product; the starry sky is a stack of 100 3-second exposures, and the 26 brightest Quadrantid meteors were precisely aligned on top of it. Stacking hundreds of individual pictures isn't necessary for meteor photography, but it can help with achieving higher image quality.

Technical specs:

* Camera: Sony RX1R II and its 35/2.0 lens
* A tabletop tripod on ground, no tracking
* Exposure: ISO5000, 6s, f/2.0 and 3s, f/2.5
* Stacked with Sequator, aligned with PTGui Pro, final adjustments in Lightroom

3097,"I agree with your arguments, most of the Quora link’s quotes are either very weak or just plain stupid (‘political fragmentation made Europe stronger against an invading force’. Really? Thats one of the dumbest things I’ve ever read).  
  
A few notes though:  
  
1) While I agree with you about your warfare argument, I would add that because Europe was so fragmented and decentralized, there were a LOT of castles around, whereas centralized states such as China had a tendency to demolish all but the most important fortifications (to prevent locals from using them to resist central authority). Sure, they were not very impressive, but they were everywhere. I wonder if this would’ve slowed down a Mongol invasion.  
  
2) Would mountain ranges have prevented the Mongols from invading Italy or Spain?  
  
3) I believe there is a consensus that despite being victorious, the Mongols did suffer significant casualties when they defeated the German-Polish army (and also against the Hungarian army). If they had gone further, they would’ve needed to defeat the much larger main German army, the Bohemian army and the French army.

3115,"&gt; Political fragmentation of Western Europe (due to feudalism). China and other large entities fell quickly to the Mongols since once their central authority was destroyed the rest collapsed immediately, this would not have happened in Western Europe.  
  
What the Mongolians did was not ""capture the capital and then conquer everywhere else"", [Kublai Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan) was only a prince, not *The Khagan* when he launched his campaign in Northern China in 1251, when the Great Khagan [Möngke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ngke_Khan) is besieging a major southern Chinese city Diaoyucheng against the Song dynasty in Sichuan. His main goal was defeat the standing imperial army in battlefield, kill enough people to spread fear, then enter Beijing (Jingshi, Dadu or Khanbaliq in Mongolian) and declare himself had the mandate of heaven, therefore should become to next emperor. In the eyes of Northern Chinese, this is the exactly the same thing as a normal ""dynasty transformation"" happened many times before. The only difference is the Emperor is Mongolian this time. Kublai Khan did not integrate China as a part of Great Mongol Khanate, but usurped the Imperial title to gain his ""base support"" of Chinese aristocracy (common people did not want Mongolian rule, saw them as barbarians but they had so say) in the incoming civil war against his brothers in 1260s.

This word has become very popular with people who try to deflect their own crimes and think their country can commit crimes but others can't. It's not whataboutism by the way, the US is the country creating the whole chaos in the middle east. They are the ones responsible for Iran-Iraq war by arming and encouraging Saddam to attack Iran [while also giving weapons to Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) which helped cripple both countries in a war that lasted 8 years. It's the US ambassador April Glasspie who told Saddam that the US would look the other way if he invaded Kuwait before the Gulf War. It's the U.S. who illegally invaded Iraq and then Syria while supplying arms to puppet regimes in Gulf to murder Yemeni citizens.. Apparently ""strategic partnership"" with theocratic undemocratic regimes like oil sheiks and military dictatorship in Egypt is okay as long as they follow orders.  
    
And I'm not even talking about Israel and Palestine yet.   
   
&gt;Changing the topic to something irrelevant to my original point are we?    
   
Not at all, we are on topic. You wanted to talk about chaos in the middle east and Iran. Speaking of chaos and Iran, it's the U.S. destroying the democratic Iran by installing Shah helped create Iran problem too, before allowing Khomeini take over and create theocratic Iran.    
    
&gt;Ah okay you obviously don’t understand the definition of democracy    
    
I understand democracy very well. That much democracy exists in Iran too, they also elect their presidents from among the candidates allowed by their religious leader, as much as American candidates allowed by their lobby groups and party system. It's people like you who don't understand democracy and confuse it with ""liberal system"". Democracy doesn't have to be liberal.

Stockholm City Hall itself is also depicted. The Tre Kronor castle and a horse ridden by Saint Erik are also there.

3517,"WTF? No. She was the one who did the ""phaseout of the phaseout"" in 2010, extending the lifetime of nuclear plants for ten years. It was hugely unpopular, partially because despite talking about emissions and climate, there was no plan to reduce coal in any way, instead they wanted to slow down the expansion of renewables.

Right after the whole thing was passed (despite large protests), Fukushima happened and Merkel feared losing the next elections. So she did a 180° change and essentially went back to the 2000 phaseout plans (so called phaseout of the phaseout of the phaseout), but instead of getting back on track with expanding renewables, they suddenly started talking that without nuclear, more coal would now be needed, and expanded coal. And despite being clear BS, that talking point worked and is still repeated endlessly, for example here on reddit, with people claiming that there is a connection between the nuclear phaseout and the usage of coal in Germany.

The whole point of that stunt was supporting the big electricity providers, and fencing them off against their new renewable competitors. The big electricity providers run both the nuclear and coal plants and are traditionally close to CDU. First they tried to do this via nuclear power, then they went via coal instead. And the back and forth regarding the nuclear phaseout enabled the nuclear providers to get some additional compensations.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ekbot7/shutdown_of_germanys_7th_to_last_nuclear_power/fd9fb40/,muehsam,1578232590

3609,"&gt;Thats not a relevant thing. Russia and Poland were mostly forests and still got defeated by Mongols.

Novgorod had a very low population in relation with western european states/kingdoms. They also had a inferior military. In case for Poland was both inferior millitary and poor leadership. The mongols only needed to retreat to a more favourable terrain and wear the polish cavalry down. Have you ever thought why Russians and Polish millitary had more mounted archers that their western counterparts, therefore the terrain couldn't have been similar to western europe?

&amp;#x200B;

If however nomad tactics were superior in every way, wouldn't everyone else rely entirely on nomad tactics or simply hired nomads in their ranks to increase their strength?

&amp;#x200B;

3611,"&gt;I certainly hope we will do our part even if it won't be much. That being said, collectively, the Armed Forces of the EU (Britain excluded) amount for around 1.3M active personnel, a few thousands MBTs, a hundred surface combatants, slightly under 50 attack submarine (both nuclear and conventional), around a thousand fighters and an independent nuclear dissuasion force.

Collectively, that's what EU member states have. Not what the EU has. How much support and how valuable of support that would be from each EU member state is left up to states themselves. And no, there is absolutely no guarantee that anyone will give valuable aid. 

Look at EU troops now. Eurocorps has an amazing 1000 soldiers. Franco-German brigade has 4000. Those two are the ""biggest"" powers in the EU.

It's a very important distinction. Germany has 362 billion dollar budget. EU however has 165 billion. What EU member states have is not what the EU has.

&gt;The main problem is the lack of coordination, doctrine commonality both politically (although that would be less of a problem in case of a direct attack on the EU) and militarily, widely varied degrees of readiness, maintenance, hardware quality and modernity leading to a lack of credibility.

There's much more issues than that. The lack of support for any kind of war from general population for example. In a poll only Finland had people saying they were ready to fight and die for their country. If a Belgian, a Spainard, an Italian, wouldn't fight for their own countries, you think they'd support sending their troops to fight for Estonia ? Hardly. 

&gt; Nonetheless, the EU is a force to be reckoned with if it were to stand united.

It doesn't stand united. ""If"" being the keyword there. And it simply can't considering the 27 member states. People have differing opinions especially if that attacker is Russia. 

Even though it has no chance of happening with current state of affairs, if Russia decided to invade the EU, it wouldn't invade one country.Unlike EU, Russia can mobilize their forces pretty fast and easily, no need for agreement and major support from each of it states. They'd take the entire eastern europe, nobody there could oppose them with the poor military budgets and ancient hardware. And EU can't mobilize fast enough to prevent that, that's simply because of how it works. Even if they could stop Russia at Germany, they wouldn't be able to push them back from eastern europe anyway, not when they take it. We'd be back to cold war lines. And honestly that is the plan of the EU in such cases, anybody who believes EU can defend anything east of Germany or would defend is delusional. 

Nukes are useless, France would never nuke Russia or Russian forces for invading anything that is not France. They'd have to be stupid to risk nuclear retaliation to France. They're only there to defend France, not the EU, they'd never be used for EU if the other side has nukes too.

There is a study by RAND that correctly points out that Russia can take over all 3 baltics states in 72 hours. EU simply can not compete, can not defend anything in Eastern Europe. EE knows this which is why they rely on USA, Poland does it, the Baltic states do it. USA is the deterrent, not the EU.

https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1200/RR1253/RAND_RR1253.pdf

And this is about NATO, not just the EU.

&gt;In a series of wargames conducted between summer
2014 and spring 2015, the RAND Corporation examined
the shape and probable outcome of a near-term Russian invasion of the Baltic states. The games’ findings
are unambiguous: As currently postured, NATO cannot
successfully defend the territory of its most exposed members. Across multiple games using a wide range of expert
participants in and out of uniform playing both sides, **the
longest it has taken Russian forces to reach the outskirts
of the Estonian and/or Latvian capitals of Tallinn and
Riga, respectively, is 60 hours.** 


If you remove US from the equation, it doesn't stop at being unable to defend the baltics, EU is incapable of defending anything east of germany. And they wouldn't even try. And they don't have the forces to conquer it back either.

It says an awful lot about the state of EU military when the quickest heavy armor response to baltic states being invaded is the US one. And it takes 7-10 days to get there at least.

&gt;The quickest-responding NATO heavy armor force would
likely be a U.S. combined arms battalion, the personnel for
which would fly in and mate up with the prepositioned equipment of the European Activity Set stored in Grafenwoehr,
Germany.14 Getting this unit into the fight is a complicated
process that will not be instantaneous. Breaking out the equipment—24 M-1 main battle tanks, 30 M-2 infantry fighting
vehicles, assorted support vehicles—preparing it for movement,
transporting it by rail across Poland, offloading it, and roadmarching it forward into the battle area are unlikely to take less
than a week to 10 days.",🇮🇱 Израел 🇮🇱,/r/europe/comments/ekbahs/estonian_lithuanian_and_latvian_foreign_ministry/fd8yd9o/,ahwhatever11,1578225326

3626,"In 1973,  [David Moses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Berg) , the founder of  ""The Children of God"" , declared the year when a comet would hit Earth and destroy all life in the United States. Then in 1986 the world would fall into chaos and in 1993 Jesus would come to wipe the broken pieces.

On June 28, 1981, the world went under according to the  "" [Lighthouse Gospel Tract Foundation](http://www.abhota.info/end3.htm) ""  from Arizona. The TV preacher  [Arnold Murray also](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shepherd's_Chapel)  guessed 1981. Evangelist Bill Maupin even knew it very well: June 30, 1981.  [Wim Malgo](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Malgo)  declared 1982 to be the last year.

1988 was then really doom and gloom. [Charles Taylor](http://www.unmoralische.de/weltuntergang.htm)  advised his believers to travel to the Holy Land in 1988 because if they took a room on the olive mountain, they could watch the Lord's return up close. The Christian television channel  [Trinity Broadcasting Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Broadcasting_Network)  postponed the end of the world to 10/11. September feast. The channel paused its regular program and broadcast instructional videos for unbelievers all day about what to do if the relatives suddenly went to heaven. Christian Communications chairman  [Hart Armstrong](http://www.unmoralische.de/weltuntergang.htm) calculated September 29, 1988.  [Wim Malgo](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Malgo), who had already declared the end of 1982,  already announced May 1988 with  [Norbert Lieth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vpctFH18aE) . [Paul Kuhn](http://www.roland-m-horn.de/ufo-sekten.php) , not the piano player, but the head of the Michael Association, calculated May 8, 1988 and said:

“Soon the time will come when your children will be brought - all these pure, innocent creatures of God should be saved - should not be exposed to the locusts and scorpions that will torture you - for five months. The chosen ones of you who are brought with the children will take care of them with our helpers. Nothing will be missing from them - believe me, they will have a wonderful time. They will spend some time on our mother ships. Later they will be taken to a beautiful place. ""

In the 90s, there was finally high life in all the setting streets. The leader of the South Korean  Dami Mission Church ,  [Lee Jang Rim](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/doomsday-preacher-jailed-1561574.html) , put the doomsday on since 28 October 1992. Four of his 20,000 disciples brought thereupon fearing for. Hundreds left family and work. The cult leader then had to go to prison for a year.

1993: Waco again. Again, the  Branch Davidians . In anticipation of the near end of the world, the members of the Davidians will entrench themselves   on the apocalypse of Guru  [David Koresh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege) . When police stormed the property after a siege of several weeks, 85 sect members died in fire.

November 24, 1993 was the date for  [Marina Tsvigun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Tsvigun) . She was leader and self-proclaimed messiah of the  Great White Brotherhood . With their white robes, pointed hat, and shepherd's stick, the followers looked a little like the apocalypse in Disneyland, but no less than 500,000 cult members planned the organized mass suicide, which could be prevented by the timely intervention of the Russian authorities.

In 1994 there were only 53 believers who committed suicide in the face of the end of the world. [Jo Di Mambro and Luc Jouret](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnentempler)  were leaders of the  Sun Templars  and declared that after suicide the 53 souls should fly in subtle form through the cosmos to the planet Sirius, where they would become Christ-like sun beings. Meanwhile, the earth should go down the apocalyptic brook. Since 38 of the 53 victims did not want to voluntarily make the transit to the planet Sirius, compassionate brothers and sisters helped. ""The hour of revelation has come, it is the hour of the apocalypse"", announced the former troop doctor and Obermotz of the Sun Templar Luc Jouret shortly before the dramatic end. On December 15, 1995 the bodies of 16 other sun temples were found in a forest near Grenoble. They killed themselves because they were overwhelmingly disappointed to have been left behind when they first went to Sirius. On March 22, 1997, the fire department finally found five charred bodies in a country house in Québec, Canada. Three distraught children, who were in an annex building, told the fire department that their parents had made their way to the planet Sirius. This was the second attempt since there had been a few breakdowns during the first transit. Since the children did not want to experience another failed transit, they begged for their lives this time.

September 1994, the American television preacher  [Harold Camping declared in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Camping)  front of millions of viewers the month of the end of the world.

1996 was the year that Irish archbishop [James Ussher](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ussher) , not the rapper, calculated in 1659  to be the year of doom. However, the archbishop also calculated in the other direction and was able to determine the day of creation precisely:  “Our world was founded in 4004 BC. B.C. on October 26 at 9 a.m. ”  What was that day of the week?

The year 1996 a German teacher and follower of the  [Star siblings](http://bewegung.taz.de/organisationen/hotspot/blogeintrag/weltuntergang-2012-%E2%80%93-hier-alle-heissen-fakten-neueste-prophezeiungen-etc-)  declared the end of the year: there would be a nuclear war and survival on Earth was impossible. However, there would be an emergency exit in the  ""light-flooded universe"" . Thousands of spaceships are  approaching for the evacuation of all children and the followers of the  star siblings. There have always been teachers who raise their students with fear. In the past it was witches and devils, today it is forest extinction, although it has now been proven in forest extinction  [that it did not exist](http://www.zeit.de/2004/51/N-Waldsterben/seite-1) !

April 10, 1997 found Canadians  [Dan Miller and Bob Wadsworth of](http://alamongordo.com/general/list-false-prophets/)  the  Biblical Astronomical Bulletin  reading the signs in the sky.

In the mid-1990s, many people had already left climate science and founded a climate religion. A scientific theory became a dogma. What should not be missing from a dogma? Right: the end of the world! The  [International Clairvoyant Association](http://www.news.at/articles/1151/39/314775/weltuntergang-bisherige-theorien)  declared the period between late 1997 and early 1998 to be the beginning of the end. The seas would become smaller, the deserts would expand. The world is suffering from crop failures and famines and the weather is going crazy. Mental illnesses and violence would increase by leaps and bounds, the natural laws would expire and demons would appear. Plagues would spread across the globe with undiminished force. Humanity should be finally destroyed by 2001 at the latest.

July 25, 1998 was the  ""X-Day""  for Bob aka [ JR Dobbs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._%22Bob%22_Dobbs) . He was leader and high priest of the  Curch of the SubGenius  and saw aliens coming from the planet XISTS for the summer of 1998 to beam the chosen SubGenii onto the spaceships of a sex god. The rest of the population would be destroyed very slowly.  ""And it was summer!""  When autumn came, the high priest was not at a loss for an answer: unfortunately the artifact on which the date was written was turned upside down - not 1998, but 8661 was the right date! We still have some time. Fuck?

October 1998 was the  beginning of the end of the world, according to the  [House of Yahweh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Yahweh) . By 2001, 80 percent of the world's population was said to have been swept away by nuclear wars. Well then:  ""HOY, HOY, HOY!""

In November 1998, after  [Natalia de Lemeny Makedonova's](http://www.spirituelles-portal.de/DIE-EWIGEN-GESETZE,1,1305.html)  masterpiece  ""Eternal Laws - New Humanity - Spiritual Transformation""  (probably published by Missing Becher Verlag), Immanuel, the son of the creator and ruler of the millennium, was born in Slovenia. As a sign of his birth, a star should appear in the sky that can be seen from any point on earth. With his birth, the cleaning of the earth should then be initiated. This woman obviously did not use gloves when cleaning with the most caustic means.

Some numerical mystics calculated the year 1998.  Finally, in the  [Revelation of John](http://www.die-bibel.de/online-bibeln/einheitsuebersetzung/bibeltext/bibel/text/lesen/stelle/76/130018/130018/ch/797d046433da2b7970ecfc6d924fec38/) it says:  ""Who has reason, calculate the numerical value of the animal"". Well, let's go: the number of the devil is 666. But God is triune. three times 666 is? Madness! That is science. Pure math!

1999 was the latest date for the  [Ashtar Command Association](http://www.ashtarcommandcrew.net/) . The end of time should have come between 1984 and 1996. All believers should be informed by extraterrestrials in good time about an evacuation via TV, radio and telepathy. In 2000 the association declared that the aliens around Ashtar had succeeded in cleaning the earth without the end of the world. Lucky!",,/r/europe/comments/ekc4cp/apocalypse_wow_the_ultimate_doomsday_list/fd8z0an/,d_agostino,1578225631

Due to our location the heating arrangements are higly redundant. Since we can't afford otherwise.

3904,"Yes, that I what I would call it, because either Soleimani or prime minister of Iraq have little support to rule in their respective countries.

I think we are missing the bigger picture in this discussion. There has been lots of civil protests going on in both Iraq and Iran. Protesters in Iraq claim that they do not want Iran influence. [""They carry signs that say, 'Iran out of Iraqi affairs' and 'The Iraqi government made by Iran'.""](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/iraqi-protesters-block-major-port-basra-unrest-continues-191102104619357.html) Iraqi's government response was, of course, violent - Ministry of Health claims [511 deaths](https://www.alghadpress.com/view.php?cat=226815)

Let's go to Iran and well - the unrest is even bigger there. People did not like the price hike of oil prices and the protests started. Government started to prosecute and shoot people, so the violence started on both sides - lots of buildings have been burned. Reuters claims around [1500](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-protests-specialreport/special-report-irans-leader-ordered-crackdown-on-unrest-do-whatever-it-takes-to-end-it-idUSKBN1YR0QR) have been killed in the protests. Who do you think has responsibility for killing these people?

Current Iraqi and Iranian governments have hurt gravely their people. There is a reason for these protests, people want to be free from the oppressors, which includes USA as well. USA only used the geopolitical situation to kill one of the top commanders. They have no way to kill him in mountainous Iran, so they do this while he is poking his nose in Iraq.

3909,"Having grown up in the UK, I can say it's due in large parts thanks to WW2. All of Europe (minus some Soviet bits, but they were getting cleanly fought back for a while) was either conquered or submissive to the Nazi regime. Except for Britain. The UK stood strong on it's lonesome. Naturally, this was with some help from over the pond, but that was far more distant. Britain dared face down what felt like all of Europe just a channel away. Ever since, Britain has kind of eternally reminisced on that finest hour. People haven't fully moved on. We vs Europe is not always portrayed at the forefront of people's mindset, but it's there once you dig deep enough.

Mind you, this only applies to some Brits. It does unfortunately seem like for the time being that's a majority, but many Brits, especially young ones, do not seem themselves as a nation forever above ""the European hivemind"".

On the other hand, the Greens are composted of both progressive and more conservative politicians when it comes to social and economic policies. They are united by their environmental agenda.

As for how the parties work internally: in the ÖVP the board members and party leaders (both internally voted) have much more power than at the Greens.

3937,"&gt; It wasn't that long ago that ""fake news"" was a new phrase. Like maybe 2015/2016 now it's mainstream.

That's a good thing though. Nothing here is actually new, it is just people becoming increasingly aware of how things have always worked. I've only examined back to the time first TV channels were created, but governments had them by the balls. Certain things simply couldn't be discussed or aired and they were given missions, which dictated what content was shown, regardless if the public actually wanted it or not. What we have now is less centralized control and more manipulators, so pointing a finger at the unwanted manipulation has become a big part of the manipulation game.

&gt; I mean it has always been a slippery slope downhill but it seems to have gone turbo mode in the last 4-5 years.

It really hasn't though. I'd say the exact opposite has happened. Current ""oil wars"" are minor hostilities and tensions. In 2000s it was open warfare and clashing of armies. In 1990s it was a million coalition troops pounding the Iraqi army to pulp in a massacre of massive scale. Old media and social media hyperbole and hysteria does not mean things have gone turbo in any way. 

The same can be said about the other stuff. Trump is just a standard populist and is doing fine on objective metrics. Brexit is EU drama, which happens every few years. It's new type of an event, but EU structures have had a steady stream of big crisis as long as I remember. Iran has been a terrorist state for longer than I've been alive. It just goes away from public view, but the trouble they cause through proxies has never stopped. Climate denial has been reduced, but even more importantly US, the big climate denier, has done more to reduce their emissions than many nations that talk big. This trend will continue, since green tech has become cheap enough to be financially preferable. Trade wars are common. Especially China was given a great deal, since the thinking was more trade will turn it more democratic and open it up. This has not worked out at all. China has only grown in power and influence, while the communists have strengthened their hold power by taking all the credit from the economic boost. China isn't going to give up that advantage without a fight though, so a trade war was the only way to force them to renegotiate. 

Honestly I think you're just a victim of the media manipulation you warn others about. Its nature is to highlight problems, hype up issues beyond their importance, and paint things in the worst/best light depending on which side they're cheerleading for. It can easily make you feel always angry/upset or turn you cynical and stop caring as a way of coping. Don't give into it too easily. Pragmatical thinking rules in foreign affairs and people can be scummy, but cynicism makes actions and motivations seem more callous and negative than they often actually are.",,/r/europe/comments/ek31da/fresh_cambridge_analytica_leak_shows_global/fd7rmlf/,DoubleSteve,1578209016

4030,"I agree and disagree.

From the eyes of a layman, it is quite easy to perceive buildings within a group of an architectural style (e.g. gothic/neo-gothic, baroque/rococo etc.) as very similar from afar, as the details are often not really bothered with. There are heaps of stylistic details and they also differ from architect to architect, they can be difficult to distinguish. Though, there are indeed major differences between buildings of an architectural style, such as the original gothic style from France (with the Strasbourg cathedral as a representative) and the more maritime red brick gothic style found in North German cities among other places.

Speaking about construction materials, I think it heavily depends on a building's context and use. In general, usage of concrete with steel reinforcement became common ever since the world population grew rapidly, as with such a construction method, fairly sturdy buildings can be built rather quickly in greater amounts and in more hazardous environments (e.g. resistance towards earthquakes, typhoons/hurricanes etc.). Caring about details there, as unfortunate as that is, would cost a lot more time and resources as well. It's not just a matter of money or the often mentioned ""laziness"" - even though I agree that most glassy and boxy buildings look quite sterile - but also conserving materials. Grand and extensively ornamented architecture were feasible when there were less people and less space and materials required for the buildings themselves (such as during the German Gründerzeit), but with the world population having risen from 2B in the 1920s to over 7B less than a century later, a change of thought was required.

Speaking about which, concerning the sustainability of materials, wood as a renewable construction material is gaining traction. It is easily processible, can be easily assembled and provides a lot of flexibility and mobility if required (assembly and disassembly). Moreover, due to its properties, wood can be used for architectural ornaments (e.g. Victorian houses in San Francisco, and traditional Chinese/Japanese architecture) and replace stones, as constantly mining for said stones would eventually irreversibly destroy natural landscapes, while trees and forests can be replanted.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/egpnqm/gothic_revival_to_the_max_fritz_göslings_proposal/fd6e4lf/,jimmy1295,1578189587

**EDIT**: For all of you responding that Whiskey did not originate in the USA, you’re correct.  Coffee didn’t originate in Italy either, just Espresso which is a way of brewing coffee.

4062,"I do think this new hyper-targetted advertising creates a new era of media manipulation.

When an old media source gives a manipulative narrative, it does this in the open - anyone can see this manipulation and call it out. They cannot have multiple conflicting narratives without this being very transparent.

But this new-media manipulation allows a single entity to produce multiple conflicting narratives simultaneously. This works because only one target audience will ever see each narrative. 

For example, it might say ""The Republican Party is against abortion"" in an advert for people who have previously liked anti-abortion posts, while simultaneously saying ""The Republican Party is for free choice"" to people who liked pro-choice posts. If you ran these two ads in traditional media this would be condemned and ridiculed, but with hyper targeted ads on Facebook, no one knows you used this strategy (assuming you limit its exposure to key marginal seats or swing voters).

We saw this before the Brexit referendum to some extent. Years later some of the ads ran by Cambridge Analytica were released by Facebook during the scandal. They targeted lefties with ads about animal welfare, racists with ads about immigration and older people with nostalgia trips and fearmongering about Turkey joining the EU.

How can these ads be scrutinized or fact checked when no one except the targeted people can see them?",A subject of Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's Proud Nation,/r/europe/comments/ek31da/fresh_cambridge_analytica_leak_shows_global/fd6ks9x/,oscarandjo,1578192488

4178,"&gt; You can't actually believe that's why the French are vetoing Macedonia. I regard you as someone intelligent... don't let your emotions get the better of you because Macron can be a bit of a twat.

Maybe I am saying that a bit emotionally but I think I am actually saying a similar thing like you. France blocks it because France wants reforms, but not really just enlargement reforms, they are overall unhappy that other things in the EU don't go their way and so they let other member states feel it by blocking something that had strong support among the rest. North Macedonia is just a bargaining chip, there is nothing that they could have done differently.

&gt; Perhaps not exactly but significant funds will be donated until they reach ""close enough"" status.

No, that's not how it has to go. Portugal or Southern Italy have not reached close enough status either. The funds can keep getting distributed based on who is below certain level of GDP, the amount can be the same, it's just that the regions who are below or above that change. If there is overall more regions below, then everyone just gets a little less money.

This is what you should want if you don't want to give more money. If you personally don't want this, then I don't really get you. We want expansion even though we know it may mean less money. This is an okay situation for us.

&gt;  little understanding that we don't want to lose even more when we come out of crisis after crisis. That's it. That's all I'm asking for. Recognition of reality and an end to the pretense we have no right to object to increasing cohesion funds. We have good reasons to do so.

Don't take your frustration on them, as I said, we would rather have less money with them in. And I am sure they would rather receive a bit less than what we used to receive back 2004 than not getting into the EU at all.

&gt; No country is able to properly tax the truly wealthy or companies. That is the state of the world at the moment and hardly the fault of Belgium individually. I don't get what magical method you think exists that can fix it.

Motivate them to reinvestate. You don't have the profits, they do, so you have to motivate them to reinvest them locally instead of hording them or investing elsewhere if you can't tax them properly.

If motivations don't work, threaten with more forceful methods, for example special sector tax on specific sectors that are the most complicit in this. Chances are that they will jump at the light motivations in order to avoid the harsher measures. It's not perfect, but that's what we are trying to do here to keep more money into our economy.

&gt; As most people here seem to agree on: that is absolutely unforgivable and treason. 

Really, some 300 euros per person per year is a treason? That's a bit dramatic don't you think? 

Look, I get that people are economically frustrated but I still think the core issues really aren't in the cohesion funds. So focusing on them when venting about the economy seems a bit unproductive to me.

Okay, you want recognition, but it's not like I am telling you that we need more money. If you want the amount that goes to cohesion staying roughly the same, then demand that, but don't hide behind some vague ""reforms"".

&gt; Geographical location and export country. They didn't manage to tax the wealthy/companies either. They just happened to be close to where economic growth is happening.

They also made painful reforms and when the expansion was happening, did not look at us only as a burden but also as an opportunity.

We can't be at two meetings at the same time and hey, we could theoretically be at ones three hours apart but I don't think we should put that on ourselves as a new norm.

There must be a substatial breach in trust between the two coalition partners that this coalition ends early and there are few chances this would be happening, imo. First, the Greens are not prone to corruption and also lack the funds and personnel for another campaign in the short term, which reduces the chances that they want to leave the coaltion early. Also the ÖVP got a free card were they can use another party (the FPÖ most likely) for an emergency law in the event of an migration crisis and that such a practice would not result in an immediate breakup of the coalition.

First doubt, than sanctions, than anger at how he was misled to have a much wider response than even the UK, than back around to saying it was ""probably Russia"" and an off-hand remark that ""even if Russia meddled in the US elections, China did too"".

That made you trust him? I thought that showed how mercurial he was (if not insane). The US is bigger, they can certainly do more, but no one can predict what they will do. Even you seemed doubtful of their reliability.

In comparison France, Germany and the UK just made a joint statement.

&gt;They are answering very different question from yours ""**Which** foreign power we should rely for defense?"". And comparing between USA and France would be naive to choose France.

So many Eastern Europeans (and even Americans) seem to believe we just want to be the new world police, and sod that (in my own personal opinion). \*The goal is to have the EU be able to fight and to pool funds together for a combined infrastructure instead of each country having their own little ineffectual army (and thus have a case where the EU as a whole has a large infantry, but almost no vehicles, navy or air-force with some exceptions).

The end result is to have a situation where some brigades are paid for and staffed by soldiers from all member states. The EU as a whole has by far an advantage in population and wealth, it's not impossible. The only obstacle is bureaucracy and politics. French soldiers are not going to be able to or want to pull everyone's weight.

I certainly don't want countries to become reliant on France as they are of the US, that's a recipe for resentment and abuse of power.",France,/r/europe/comments/ejuhmm/pompeo_accuses_europe_of_not_being_helpful_over/fd2ygos/,frissio,1578152928

I said those things, from my point of view: they are my words. Not yours. You have failed to provide any real proof that stifling of free speech is happening nor that it is a form of violence. Has anyone threatened you to not speak? Or have they disagreed with you, sometimes aggressively and emotionally but still, only targeting you verbally?

&gt;If you can't tell that free speech is an absolute value

No, it is not. There are no absolute rights. The moment one right starts to interfere and threaten another, we need to draw a line between them. If free speech starts to threaten one very basic human right, the right to feel safe, non threatened, we need to limit free speech. We have NEVER had absolute free speech for a reason: it is impossible in practice. I hope i don't need to give examples when speech is not free for safety reasons alone.

\&gt;  why I make the case that the extreme-left shutting it down can be even more dangerous than the acts of the far-right, then farewell.

You have not given any real arguments about this, you have only stated it. you made a claim and the only argument you have is ""to me this is true"". I can already see the ""i have no time for you good sir, goodbye"" coming as you can't give me any actual examples of violence nor a decent argument that proves that it is more dangerous than actual violence.

The yellow-red distinction in Vienna pretty directly follows the Gürtel, which divides the traditional “bourgeois” districts from workers districts. Today these distinctions are far less present but the districts outside of the Gürtel are generally less well connected, have fewer museums or tourist attractions (aside from Schönbrunn) and are in general less fancy. Also higher density of migrants which might be a factor that makes some tourists uneasy (even though muggings and such are basically non-existent). 

The Parisian map is basically a meme, with the dark-red clutter in the North being directly at Gare du Nord, one of the “blackest” areas inside of the city limits. It’s a rather inhospitable area, not because of the African diaspora as much as because of it being a generally more low-income area with alot of heavy traffic (noise, bad air quality, careless drivers, cyclists and motorcyclists, etc.).

It's just that from a historical perspective many European landwars where fought over the axis between Berlin and Moscow. The Polish corridor is critical in any possible defense strategic for the Baltic states and/or the rest of Europe. 

Russia can roll thousands of tanks to their border 'for a training exercise' and do a full on invade and secure those countries before anyone can act (unless nuclear). 
That was one of the reasons why bases like Rammstein are so important for the Nato core mission. It allows to for rapid responses. T.hat still won't mean the Russians won't conquer the Baltics, but it could make it a lot more costly. The difficulty would be that the new European army would need to secure the airspace against the Russian anti airplane defense. That is possible, but tricky.

The only other option is to put in human shields, c.q. tripwire troops. That is still an option, with or without an European army. Many countries have put troops close to the demilitarized zone in South Korea to make sure it legitimizes their aid to South Korea should the North attack. This is still an option in addition to the EU army.

Wrong. It has been under social-democratic leadership.

Transnistria (with a majority of Russian speakers) was tacked on to Moldova by the Soviet Union and heavily industrialised to the point where that strip of land making up 17% of the population was responsible for 40% of Moldova's GDP when the Union collapsed.

The main issue is ethnic tensions and the loyalty to Russia of the Russian speaking population. You can see the same thing in Georgia and Ukraine, where Russia is the ""protector"" of these ethnic minorities and heavily uses them as destabilising agents; in the Baltics to a lesser extent, as they are NATO/EU members. 

This affinity for Russia also extends to the ""native"" population through decades of Russification. In particular, for Moldova, between the first annexation in 1812 and the union in 1918, the Romanian identity survived in the illiterate rural areas despite being suppressed, precisely because of their illiteracy (as the Russian influence simply couldn't get to their heads). The USSR learned from the Empire's mistakes, eradicated the intelligentsia, heavily taught this adversity to Romania/Romanian (along with banning it to the point where buying a Romanian book was only possible by taking a train to Moscow), and created a distinct ""Moldovan"" identity with its own history and lore - including Romanians as [evil fascists](https://www.timpul.md/articol/comunistii-vor-sa-schimbe-tricolorul-fascist-17044.html) (read - generic Russian term for bad person, whether it is supposed to mean anything or not), and Russia as the protector and future (I recently saw an interview with a Moldovan media personality that speaks Romanian with a Russian accent because growing up, her parents spoke Romanian to each other, but Russian to the children, because they thought the USSR is the future). As a personal note, I identify myself as a Moldovan first and Romanian second, just like a Bavarian would say they are German - but this distinct identity created by the USSR is ridiculous to the point a [""Romanian-Moldovan dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldovan%E2%80%93Romanian_dictionary)"" has been published; sort of like compiling an entire book of slang used in London and call it a completely different language than what is spoken in Manchester. Meanwhile, of course, the Russians/Ukrainians were just happy to be top dogs and speak and write their own language.

4719,"Not OP but:

&gt;What were the election results like for Catalonia, and why did the regional court ruled in such a way to undermine the president in the effect that he would lose his position,

The regional court directly depends on the Spanish judiciary, and even though it's the Catalan supreme court it's not the highest authority, so it defers to the Spanish Supreme for criteria, which is not favourable to pro-Catalan interpretations of law.

&gt;and why does the administration board majority consist of federalist parties when Catalonia is majority independence parties in power,

Spain is not a federation, it's a centralised country (like France) but with regions that are given certain powers (power resides in Spain and is ""lent"" to regions, to be taken back if desired). Therefore the majority parties in this board are mainstream spanish parties since the board is for all of Spain, not only Catalonia, and in particular it's formed by judges related to the Spanish Supreme court, a biased institution with judges related to Spanish political parties and other members directly appointed by said parties.

&gt;is not Spain a federalised monarchy where each region holds autonomy, how can a Barcelona board effect election council results in a region, isn't this unconstitutional and outside the scope of their power?

As I said, Spain is not a federation and the central board can over-rule the regional board. However, it's becoming clear that this decision was still not within their power because they weren't competent to decide who is or isn't the President of Catalonia.",Fake Country once again,/r/europe/comments/ejl6sz/catalan_flag_now_flying_alone_in_the_palace_of/fd1yo2o/,AleixASV,1578138880

So yes, leaders of Krajina are the ones that asked  them to leave. Milosevic basicly left them out to dry after promising so much. 

Did they leave out of fear of vengeance? Probably. Was the fear justified considering to what they did to Croatians in those occupied areas? Probably. But they left before the military operation ended and it's proven in the international court that the operation while not spotless wasn't organised war crime/ethnic cleansing.

People from Eastern EU countries argue in favour of these countries, because we have sympathy for the people there, not in the sense that we are necessarily super culturally close to all of them, but in the sense that we understand their situation and what they are dealing with it.

This sentiment is way less common in WE, hence why you see many people from WE who have zero sympathy for the Western Balkans.

The leader of the League thanks the US president: ""It was eliminated a terrorist, one of the most ruthless men in the world and an enemy of Israel."" The Democratic Party: ""Avert an escalation""

“Free women and men have to thank President Trump and the American Democracy because they got rid of Soleimani, one of the most dangerous and cruel man in the world, an Islamic terrorist, an enemy of the West, of Israel, of rights and freedom.” With these words, the leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, comments on the blitz in which the US killed the Islamic extremist Soleimani.

Especially during the long period that preceded the 2018 election campaign in Italy, Salvini had focused heavily on creating a relationship with the US president. During a meeting in 2016 Trump said to Salvini: ""You will become prime minister in Italy"", a prediction that then half came true, pushing Carroccio’s leader to the position of vice-premier.

Meanwhile, Italy is making a strong appeal to act in moderation and responsibility, keeping channels of dialogue open, avoiding acts that can have serious consequences for the entire region. This was reported by a press release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led by Luigi Di Maio. “The latest developments in the situation in Iraq are worrying. In recent days we have witnessed a dangerous escalation that culminated in the killing of the Iranian general (Qasem) Soleimani.” In the note, the foreign ministry argues that ‘no effort must be spared to ensure de-escalation and stability’. The foreign ministry also adds that ""new outbreaks of tension are not in anyone's interest and they risk being fertile ground for terrorism and violent extremism"".

""Great concern about the extremely high level of tension in Iraq after the violence in recent days against the US embassy and the elimination of Soleimani. Italy and Europe take all the useful steps to avoid an uncontrollable escalation in the area "", writes the secretary of the Democratic Party Nicola Zingaretti.

Let's say Cologne to Berlin. 1h flight + 30 min tram + 30 min to 1h boarding time + 30 min walking through the airport, security and a bit of sitting around vs 10 min tram + 10 min sitting around hoping there's no delay or change in track + 5h train ride with masses of people and maybe a delay along the way, which is especially tragic if you have to change train.

Nope those are in service vehicles in reserves on in updating is another 7k tanks, these are largely out of comision and cannot be used until updated and/or repaired/scrapped. I counted only those that are listed in active service duty according to russian ministry of defense numbers.

&gt;Lithuania holds 12,000,000 barrels of proven oil reserves as of 2016, ranking 88th in the world and accounting for about 0% of the world's total oil reserves of 1,650,585,140,000 barrels.


According to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_consumption) the worldwide daily consumption for oil is:

I think we shouldn't read further into this than saying its the opening of a new pipeline that is providing additional infrastructure to transport gas from existing reserves.

5142,"Yes, you got that right, Greek does not descend from Latin. However, *a lot* of loanwords have gone back and forth between Greek (Ancient, Medieval, Modern) and Latin/Italian, because of the long shared histories between the two countries, from Greek colonisation of southern Italy, to Roman rule of Greece, to Byzantine rule of Italy, to Venetian rule of Greece. So I'd be curious to see the numeric value between standard modern Greek and standard Italian. There's also many similar words with Catalan and Castilian, via Latin/Italian. For example, words that Latin borrowed from Greek, were passed into Catalan, Castilian, Portuguese, French, and Romanian.  Another example, Greek has borrowed words from Venetian Italian, which have cognates in Castilian and Catalan, hence Greek has similar words with Castilian and Catalan via Latin.

Again, you're right that Greek and Albanian are their own IE branches. However, the smalli-ish number between the two languages does not surprise me. Being neighbors for thousands of years, the two languages have had lots of time to exchange loanwords, in contrast with Turkish which is a newcomer to the region, and has only been a neighboring language (to the Greeks) for about 500 years. Furthermore, I thought it possible that *maybe* the Hellenic and Albanian branches may have broken off from each other at a later time than they broke off from the other IE languages.

&gt;the war in Syria started with a civil war and the US had nothing to do with the teenagers arrests and armed forces shooting protesters who sparked the beginning of the civil war.

if the US stance was 100% neutral, the conflict would have fizzled out in a matter of months if not weeks instead of continuing for an ongoing decade.



the points that are to be concluded from the information within these articles:

1. Iraq war was for Israel's national security. 
2. The US has been opportunistically planning for a proxy war in Syria since at least '96 to simply 'roll back' Israel's rivals.
3. Jordan and Turkey would help the US in the proxy war against Syria as suggested by the political document written in '96. This turned out to be the case with the CIA's $1 billion aid/training ""rebels"" which entered via Jordan and Turkey. 
4. Per Seymour Hersh's article published in 2007: the US approved Saudi funding of Sunni radicals to counter and contain Iran's foothold in the middle east. This also later turned out to be true as we know KSA funneled billions into ISIS. The US is silent and complicit.

France had fertile soil and a good climate for agriculture, at the time when food was the limiting factor of population growth. But during the industrialisation of the 19th and 20th centuries, agriculture and transportation became much more efficient (fertilizer, draining new land for agriculture, better transportation of food), which also led to an economic boom (far fewer people needed for agriculture, freeing up workers for more lucrative parts of the economy).

So in other words, Sanchez or anyone from the Spanish parties trying to solve the issue when JxCat frames everything in a lose/lose way.

5324,"It also happens almost every time North Korea makes a threat: People go all ""OMG WW3 is gonna happen"".

Funny thing is: For a few years I was somewhat fascinated by this so-called ""Hermit Kingdom"". So I watched all sorts of documentaries and vlogs about it, and started following websites focused on news about (and from) North-Korea. And especially thanks to the latter I quickly learned a few things.

1: They issue threats **all the time**. You really start to get the impression that whenever a mainstream media outlet picks up on it, it was a slow news day and they want to report *something*. Because they do it almost weekly.

2: That most of these threats aren't made with the international community as an audience in mind. It's for internal consumption. Reinforcing their own population of the idea of this common enemy. Have you noticed how with half these threats they often provide a video of some lady reading from a desk? That's just their news channel. It's not like they send those videos out to world leaders.

Now don't understand me wrong: They also make threats throughout official channels, and it's understandable that it gets more attention whenever they tested a new rocket or H-bomb. But yeah, I've seen topics about their ""threats"" on the top of /r/worldnews several times now, and half the time it only had their news channel as a source.

5442,"Text:

Samuel huntington was almost right. The late American professor pricked a bubble of Western triumphalism with a gloomy prediction of strife in “The Clash of Civilisations?” in 1993. Where he erred was the medium through which this friction would take place. Rather than civilisations rubbing against one another as groups of nation-states, as Mr Huntington forecast, the 21st century is witnessing the rise of the “civilisation-state”.

The term is in vogue. Chinese academics herald China as the world’s sole civilisation-state, rather than an old-hat, 19th-century nation-state. Vladimir Putin, however, has hopped on the bandwagon, declaring that Russia’s status as a civilisation-state prevented the country “from dissolving in this diverse world”. Indian commentators have long wrestled with whether their country is one, too. Other potential candidates for civilisation-state status include the United States and even Turkey. Another name is rarely mentioned, but should be added to this growing list: the eu.

A world of civilisation-states, where the state protects (and projects) an entire civilisation rather than a mere nation, fits the eu rather well. No longer would the bloc be a geopolitical duck-billed platypus, occupying its own weird category. Though it is clearly much more than a trading union, it is still far from being a nation-state. It has its own currency, budget rules and regulates everything from strawberry size to car emissions. It controls essential parts of state sovereignty, such as customs, as well as migration between its member states. And in the coming decades it will probably build something resembling a small army and even police its borders. But the eu member-states still wield far greater powers across much domestic, and even more foreign, policy.

eu leaders of every flavour, meanwhile, have started banging on about civilisation. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, has long couched his attacks on refugees as a defence of European civilisation. The European Commission has just offered its own rather bloodless and bureaucratic version of civilisation by introducing a commissioner for “Protecting The European Way of Life”, responsible for dealing with security, migration and integration. (After an outcry, the title was flipped with a spot of linguistic gymnastics to “Promoting Our European Way of Life”.) Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, speaks of European civilisation in existential terms, demanding that the bloc gets its act together or be superseded by China and America.

These visions of the European civilisation-state are different, which is potentially something of a problem. Mr Orban equates European civilisation with white Christendom, whereas the commission at least attempts to build on civic values. Mr Macron focuses on the geopolitical strength of America and China, which could undermine the enlightenment values represented by Europe. Still, they share common themes.

All, for example, are defensive. European leaders talk about protecting Europe. Rather than engage in political evangelism, the eu is giving up on universalism, even though civilisation-states naturally tend to be expansive. Where European leaders once spoke of “Western” values, increasingly they speak of European ones. America has taken a nativist turn, and Brexit Britain is following suit. In such circumstances, a renewed focus on a specific European civilisation—and how to defend it—is only natural.

Sadly, chatter about civilisations can swiftly become paranoid. The far right peddles conspiracy theories about European civilisation being “replaced”, whether by immigrants or rising powers such as China. Such talk is now echoed by moderate politicians. “We know that civilisations are disappearing,” declared Mr Macron last summer, warning that Europe would be wiped out too unless it changes fundamentally. A shared apocalyptic vision may bind the populist right into the European project, but it would do so only at a heavy cost to Europe’s self-proclaimed values.

Likewise, the renewed emphasis on European civilisation is exclusive. In his book “The Rise of the Civilisational State”, Christopher Coker argues that questions of culture rather than political ideology are now the currency of politics. Such a shift changes the fundamental question asked of citizens, as Mr Huntington laid out two decades ago. If politics and economics dominate, then the question is “What do you think?” This has a mutable answer. If culture dominates, the question becomes “Who are you?”—an answer that can less easily be changed.

## There’s a good side and a bad side. Choose wisely

A more benign analysis holds that European leaders have built on shared civilisational foundations since 1945, carving out a niche for Europe in the face of increasingly powerful allies and rivals, whether America, Russia or China. “The concept of the eu as civilisational state is so deeply embedded in European politics now that it shapes the rhetoric of all political actors involved in it,” argues Alexander Clarkson, a historian at King’s College London. In short, the urge has always been there, but now it has a natty name.

If the vision of Mr Macron and his fellows triumphs, then this civilisational turn need not have a dark side. Limiting “universal” values to the European sphere shows a dearth of ambition but a practical admission of the eu’s place in an increasingly illiberal world order dominated by America and China. Yet the risks of this shift are also obvious. A paranoid continent, fearing for its continued existence, is not one that makes healthy decisions. An emphasis on specifically European values could lead to chauvinism. A political class that echoes far-right tropes about being replaced risks feeding the very populists they want to squeeze out. One of the eu’s crowning achievements has been tempering the nationalism that triggered two world wars in the space of three decades. Replacing “nationalism” with a crude form of “civilisationalism” would do little good. As Huntington might have said, a clash of civilisation-states would be ugly indeed.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ejmiwj/eu_as_a_civilisation_state/fcywx9w/,europeanman,1578088880

5449,"False. The central electoral board has ruled Junqueras is to be stripped of immunity. And he has.

The European Court simply stated that the European Parliament should have been requested permission to jail him, as the NEW ruling states that he was a MEP from election day. There was no precedent and ir was a new situation, so Spain asked.

It changes nothing for Junqueras, who was judged and sentenced. It will be more relevant for Puigdemont if he ever returns: FIRST asking the Parliament, then trial.

In no way and form the European Court of Justice has been overrun. His immunity was toast as soon as he commited embezzlement (among other things), and someone with a FIRM sentence has no business in the European Parliament.

The Court itself said this and again IN NO WAY they demanded him to be released.

So, he is no longer immune. He has his sentence, and the EU Court is perfectly fine with this.

Torra, for instance, while much crazier and more racist than Junqueras, is doing his thing like many others. No embezzlement so far, right? 

Spanish is one of the most lenient and most developed democracies in Europe, according to all indexes.

And here is Clinton during her deposition:

&gt; And finally, most significantly, the next day, within 24 hours, you had a conversation with the Egyptian prime minister.

&gt; You told him this, ""We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.""

&gt; Let me read that one more time.

&gt; ""We know,"" not we think, not it might be, ""we know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.""

&gt; State Department experts knew the truth. You knew the truth. But that's not what the American people got. And again, the American people want to know why.

&gt; Why didn't you tell the American people exactly what you told the Egyptian prime minister?

&gt; CLINTON: Well, I think if you look at the statement that I made, I clearly said that it was an attack. And I also said that there were some who tried to justify...

&gt; (CROSSTALK) JORDAN: Secretary Clinton...

&gt; CLINTON: ... on the basis -- on the basis of the video, Congressman.

&gt; And I think...

&gt; JORDAN: Real, real quick, calling it an attack is like saying the sky is blue. Of course it was an attack.

&gt; (CROSSTALK)

&gt; JORDAN: We want to know the truth. The statement you sent out was a statement on Benghazi and you say vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material on the Internet. If that's not pointing as the motive of being a video, I don't know what is. And that's certainly what -- and that's certainly how the American people saw it.

&gt; CLINTON: Well, Congressman, there was a lot of conflicting information that we were trying to make sense of. The situation was very fluid. It was fast-moving. There was also a claim of responsibility by Ansar al-Sharia. And when I talked to the Egyptian prime minister, I said that this was a claim of responsibility by Ansar al-Sharia, by a group that was affiliated -- or at least wanted to be affiliated -- with Al Qaida.",USA USA USA,/r/europe/comments/ejbzk2/when_you_wake_up_at_7am_as_a_european/fcykjbh/,InPaceViribus,1578081679

5608,"DeepL translation:

&gt;The Central Electoral Board has decided to disqualify Quim Torra and ""to leave without effect"" his credential as a member of the Catalan Parliament, which would prevent him from remaining at the head of the Generalitat as established by the Statute. The decision has been taken after more than four hours of debate and with the National Electoral Commission divided. The votes of seven members have served to promote the decision. Another six members have announced the casting of a particular vote in the opposite sense to the decision adopted by the majority.

&gt;In its letter, the National Electoral Commission states that ""the credential of Joaquim Torra's deputy remains without effect [...] with the effect of the credential notifying this agreement"". In other words, Torra would cease to be a Member of Parliament almost immediately, something with which Parliament has already announced that it does not agree. The Statute of Catalonia states that the president of the Generalitat is elected from the group of deputies with a seat in the Parliament. If Torra were to lose that parliamentary status, he would also be left without the status of head of the executive of that autonomous community.

&gt;Torra has reacted by calling an extraordinary meeting of his Consell Executiu this Friday evening. At the end of this meeting, Torra is expected to make ""an institutional declaration.

&gt;The decision of the Central Electoral Board nullifies the previous agreement adopted by the Barcelona Electoral Board that had decided not to disqualify the pro-independence leader on the understanding that a firm condemnation would have to weigh on him. Quim Torra has been condemned to a year and a half of disqualification for his refusal to remove yellow ribbons from the facade of the Generalitat during the election campaign of 28th April. The sentence was dictated by the Superior Court of Justice of Catalonia and against it there is still an appeal in the Supreme Court.

&gt;The petition for disqualification was promoted by the Partido Popular, Ciudadanos and Vox. In the ranks of Pablo Casado they already celebrate as a success the decision that can lead Catalonia to a forced electoral advance in a matter of months. If Torra's farewell is completed, the Parliament has two months to appoint a new president or go to elections. The spokesperson of the Partido Popular, Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo, was one of the first to react to the news. She has done so from her Twitter account to say: ""The disobedient Torra, disqualified thanks to the PP"". Pablo Casado, also from twitter, has assured that the president of the Generalitat ""must cease immediately"".

&gt;The Electoral Board is made up of eight members proposed by the General Council of the Judiciary, whose appointment comes from a draw among Supreme Court judges. The body is completed with another five members proposed by the parties, who must be active professors of law or political science.

**An administrative body charged with the supervision of elections has removed the Parliamentary seat of the current President of the Catalan government *outside of elections* due to him not removing a banner from a public building's balcony quick enough, thus also removing him from office**. 

This is the second President elected by Catalans and removed by office in a row by Spanish officials without any input by Catalans (plus a soon-to-be candidate was jailed the day before he could take office), yes, I'm not kidding.

&gt;The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), Pub.

The authorization granted the President the authority to use all ""necessary and appropriate force"" against those whom he determined ""planned, authorized, committed or aided"" the September 11th attacks, or who harbored said persons or groups. The AUMF was signed by President George W. Bush on September 18, 2001. In December 2016, the Office of the President published a brief interpreting the AUMF as providing Congressional authorization for the use of force against al-Qaeda and other militant groups.[1][2]

From the House Select Committee's report: *The assets ultimately deployed by the Defense Department in response to the Benghazi attacks were not positioned to arrive before the final lethal attack.*

From the Senate Intelligence Report: *there were no US military resources in position to intervene in short order in Benghazi to help defend the Temporary Mission Facility and its Annex.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After Benghazi the administration lied about the cause. . . 

That is also incorrect. There is no evidence that the administration tried to deliberately mislead the public about the causes of the attack. They relayed information that later turned out to be less than accurate, but it was an accurate explanation of what US intelligence at the time was indicating.",,/r/europe/comments/ejbzk2/when_you_wake_up_at_7am_as_a_european/fcy3kfs/,HamburgerEarmuff,1578074309

5745,"A reduced American military presence in Europe/NATO wouldn't just immediatley cause Russia to invade Germany, however, it would play into their larger geopolitical goals. 

Russia has constantly pushed back against NATO and shown a consistent strategy in expanding their sphere of influence in the modern day (see 2008 South Ossetian Crisis and the 2014 annexation of Crimea). Some experts have indicated a belief that Russia will continue this behavior, annexing parts of east Ukraine in order to develop a land route to Crimea. 

There is also a real possibility that they would also target the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. However as these states are a part of NATO it would be a major test of NATOs ability to actually remain coordinated against this type of aggression, especially if it comes in the same type of hybrid warfare action as Putin has pushed previously (enciting, arming, then sending in troops to support the Russian speaking populations of these nations).

Tying back to Germany in particular... Germany is the center of US military presence in Europe, it is the European nation with the most US troops and the central command for US European Military Operations, as well as the operational center of NATO where most NATO operations originate from. It's not just a legacy tying back to WW2 but also the partition of Germany during the Cold War (recalling that the Iron Curtain cut right through Germany). Germany and the US are inextricably tied in the defense of Europe due to the way military operational command has been organized in Europe and a long tied military coordination started with the occupation of West Germany.

Russia hasn't been subtle about their intent to further expand their sphere of influence and attack other nations through non-conventional methods. It really surprises me that people paint them as if they're just some bogeyman dreamed up by the US. No, they're not going to be sending tanks to go marching on Berlin, they are however going to keep picking at the edges of the former Soviet Union to regain control over those nations (as well as continue new initiatives like strengthing their position in Syria to maintain their naval position on the Mediterranean).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ejbzk2/when_you_wake_up_at_7am_as_a_european/fcxn3du/,bukanir,1578066876

And I’ll start by saying I would love for us to get it in check a little. But does the rest of the world (specifically our allies)  really want us to not be kinda the leader? It feels like  hypothetically speaking if America wasn’t one of the top military countries the rest of the world might be in serious jeopardy because the other countries that would step up and take our places might not have the best intentions. Not to say America doesn’t fuck up a lot and I understand thanks to trump a lot of people hate us (and I get it) but if you critically think about this and look at places like China, Iran, Russia, or the list of any other top contenders wouldn’t the rest of the world look far worse? Wouldn’t other countries struggle to have M4A and many of the more democratic socialist ideals they have if they had to spend money on protecting themselves?  I am thinking  this idea will get downvoted on Reddit but I think about this a lot when I think about how I really want my country to not spend so much on military. But then I think about what that means for the rest of the world and at the end of the day I always think even with our fuck ups we have good intentions and constantly push progress. If America wasn’t a leader with strong military would the western world even have the LGBTQ rights? It’s easy for people of western culture to fight for these basic rights when you don’t have to worry about people who oppose those ideals rolling in with tanks and dropping bombs which many of the top contenders don’t agree with progress the same as us. Anyway I’m rambling and this will probably be downvoted but I’d love to hear some outside prospective. Because I would love for us to to spend money on the military so we can worry about our own social programs.

He did it to show he’s “not Obama and this is not Benghazi” which was kind of ridiculous given that nobody died during the Baghdad embassy thing. But watching partisan politics objectively is like watching a circus. The guys supporting trump in this supported the Iraq war but criticized Obama over Libya. Then Trump got criticized over being weak with N Korea (they have nukes) but now he’s too tough on Iran and is trying to cause war. The party in opposition always shits on whatever the president does because that’s what they do. When Obama was president, the Republicans did the exact same thing. Just criticized everything and then did similar things when they came to power.
