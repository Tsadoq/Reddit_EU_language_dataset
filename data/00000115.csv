I’m a Microbiologist for the USDA FSIS, responsible for testing comminuted poultry and nBPW poultry rinses for *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter*. 

This comment hits the nail on the head. These poultry products, even with chemical interventions, are *filthy*. We screen somewhere around 20-30% positive for *Salmonella* per batch tested, and these samples are not truly representative of their produced lots. I suspect the Sal rate is closer to 100% because of how endemic the organism is in poultry production establishments. *Pseudomonas* *aeruginosa* and *E.coli* are prevalent as well.

97,"hey, thats just incorrect. i dont know what kind of apple trees you have, but there are significant differences between a ""normal"" appletree (https://images.app.goo.gl/3HetXbqpt8FjXjh56) and the one a applefarmer uses to produce and sell apples in large quantities (https://images.app.goo.gl/A4BGde76eZBaHmHTA). 

i am no expert, but my grandparents and my uncle are apple farmers and i live in the largest closed apple-producing region in the EU (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrolean_Apple_PGI)

being an applefarmer is (like every farmer) a full-time-job with (almost) no holidays. my grandparents have only 2 weeks a year where they can go somewhere else for more than one day.

at the beginning of the year they prep and cut all the trees for spring, and around easter then all the apple trees blossom. this is a very crucial time, because if the nights get too cold the buds get destroyed, so every night they check the Temperature and if its too cold they need to spray every tree with water, so that a protective layer of ice forms on the buds.

after that, in juni/july many little apples form (like really small green balls on long stems), and then comes the time of trimming/reducing the branches where there are not many apples on. they cut away a large portion of the apples (i think more then 50%?), so that the juices of the tree only go into the rest of the apples, so they get larger and better (quality over quantity). 

in August then starts the time of harvest, and it goes 'till mid November. harvesting is the phisically hardest job i have done in my Life, very tiring, very boring and you work &gt;10 hours every day, even saturday/sunday. 

you may have wondered why the trees on our farms have this particulare shape like the Picture linked above. the answer is simple: to make working with them easier. they are aligned in rows, so a ""harvester""  (https://images.app.goo.gl/pMHs2TqYKbrHsjDR6) which is only a Platform to stand on (all the harvesting is manual) can pass through.

another ""fun"" fact: when harvesting, you measure EVERY apple, the ones who are too small (or too big) go into a extra chest for making apple juice or strudel etc. of course you do not ""measure"" exactly every apple, you need a feel for it and if someone is unsure  anyone has templates to put the apple in.",,/r/europe/comments/ev1x24/us_wants_the_eu_to_accept_chemicalwashed_chicken/fft8p2k/,huntersniper007,1580212420

&gt;Salmonellosis is the second most commonly reported gastrointestinal infection and an important cause
of foodborne outbreaks in the EU/EEA.

https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/give-me-your-children-voices-from-the-lodz-ghetto

&gt; Building by building, the German SS and police authorities, assisted by the Jewish ghetto police and firemen, assembled, inspected, and selected the elderly, the ill, and children under age 10 for deportation. Apartments were searched for people attempting to hide. Those who tried to flee were shot. More than 500 Jews were murdered during the round-up. Accompanied by the shrieks and wails of the victims and the spared alike, the methodical search of the ghetto tore 15,000 victims—including 6,000 children—from their families. All were sent to certain death.

&gt; “I saw two wagons full of little children drive past the open gate. Many of the children were dressed in their holiday best, the little girls with colored ribbons in their hair. In spite of the soldiers in their midst, the children were shrieking at the top of their lungs. They were calling out for their mothers.”

Yes

&gt;Ever heard of a Prince?

Quite a few.

&gt;Do you find the connection between it and a monarchy?

There's a connection *in a monarchy*, and I guess you could argue that a principality can't exist without a monarchy existing at some point depending on which definition. That said, you don't technically need a monarchy to have a prince/principality.

&gt;check something called Google if you're stuck

Principality: a state ruled by a prince

Monarchy: a form of government with a monarch at the head

Monarch: a sovereign head of state, especially a king, queen, or emperor

    -  late Middle English: from late Latin monarcha, from Greek monarkhēs, from monos ‘ALONE’ + arkhein ‘TO RULE’.

Social security can provide a social safety net that enables more risk taking and entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs tend to come from two sets of people: immigrants who have nothing to lose, and rich kids who can risk a few years because they have a backup plan. 

A combination of highly competitive free markets with a social safety net to catch those who fall through the cracks and provide a minimum standard of living while people get back on their feet ends up being, IMHO, the ideal middle-ground. 

The issue with France is much deeper: it is an insanely protective society which ends up concentrating the outcomes on a lucky few.

She didn't flee the scene of the accident, she wasn't intoxicated, she didn't do it on purpose or choose to take unnecessary risk.  She's just a dumbass who fucked up.  Leaving may have been classless and cowardly but that wasn't a crime either nor is it the crime she's been charged with.

I'm not particularly concerned with her case or anything but I just don't understand what the UK expects from us legally speaking.  We can't just extradite a citizen because it was requested which was what the UK was originally asking.  Then months later the UK charges her with a crime that isn't particularly credible so that she could be extradited even though she had diplomatic immunity.  Sending her back is going to be so hard to do once the courts get involved.  The US gov will have to prove that it has the authority to extradite her despite her immunity status and then the US will have to prove that she's being fairly accused of a crime.  It will be a tricky and long process, and honestly it's all a bit much for a tragic motor vehicle accident.  If there are other details I'm unaware of or haven't got the facts right then my apologies, but as I understand it I don't know what we could legally do.  The family should just take them to civil court in the US and sue the shit out of them, so much easier for all involved.

If they take this “have my cake and eat it to” kind-of attitude with the U.S. then they’re in for a very rude awakening. They are a small island nation with an economy that will be above-average for a nation that size, at best, on their own. The U.S. will force the UK to bend to its will on everything of substance. American agricultural interests will dominate the regulations in a trade deal. The UK will have to accept all of our chlorinated chicken, our pesticide-sprayed produce, and our cruelty-seasoned, hormonal, and antibiotic-ridden meats. There will be little to no compromise here.

The NHS will cease to function. American insurance companies will do everything they can to get into the market then degrade and dismantle it. They’ll promise things up front to get in the door, but then they’ll do what they’ve done here. Pay off politicians and bureaucrats, launch disinformation campaigns, and soon the UK will be the exact same healthcare hellscape that we are. Because you’ll need medicine, and who else will save your bacon but your noble son come to care for his aging father.

And, again, if the UK tries to hold out or make a fuss that’s okay. Ireland is an English-speaking, ‘business-friendly’, EU-member that is just ripe for amazing trade concessions at the UK’s expense. The Commonwealth countries are either too poor to be useful trading partners, are firmly in US orbit so they’ll look to us first economically and politically, or they’re powerful enough in their own right that they’ll be able to make their own demands. They won’t save the UK.

If the UK seriously rejects the EU in the aftermath of Brexit then the only other possible western partner that’s available is the US, and we know it. The UK will need us. We don’t necessarily need the UK right off the bat, and we are large enough that the Brits will cry ‘uncle’ first in any hardball negotiations.

I mean the fact that there was only the eastern front between 1941 and mid 1944 (D-day) and that in any point of the war at least 80% of the German forces were in the east ( even on d-day) speaks to who was the derisive player there.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/eukq7b/on_this_day_75_years_ago_the_nazi_auschwitz/ffsdp7a/,Pekidirektor,1580179221

611,"&gt;That's very much the impression  you'll give the visitor, that the Parthenon's history either never  happened or that it is unimportant.  
&gt;  
&gt;That it only exists as an isolated piece of art, and not a piece of history.

Then I guess that most monuments that are not ancient ruins are not pieces of history, like the Windsor Castle, the St.Peter's Cathedral, etc etc

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Again, you're presenting this strange position that any changes the  Parthenon went through after 400 B.C are ""distortions"", as if the  Parthenon is a static object in a vaccum and not a historic building  that's existed for millenia. 

You are the one doing it, you're the one opposed to any changes, the one who want to keep the Parthenon a static object in vacuum forever

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; \-Implying the Parthenon has neither cool nor historic parts 

No, I'm implying that restoring a monument to its former state doesn't mean getting rid of any other artifact placed there in other centuries

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not an impossible task because it is undoable, it is impossible  because the Parthenon being ""incomplete"" or ""finished"" is a false  dicotomy. It already is complete, you'd be adding something to it, not  completing it. 

Meet a random person on the street, show them a picture of the Parthenon and ask them whether they think it's complete or not, I bet at least 90% of the people will say incomplete. You may consider it complete but to the human eye it looks incomplete because there are holes on the roof, damaged columns and whatever, just like if you show a shirt with a random hole in it it doesn't matter if it's some kind of modern art and the hole was made on purpose, it looks incomplete

Saying that you would just be adding something to it is just a sohpism, like saying that a broken chair with a missing leg is already complete and adding a leg would just be adding a new part

&amp;#x200B;

And by the way, due to the fact that ancient greeks chose not to rebuild the Parthenon after the persians destroyed it, I'd be ok if they left the Parthenon specifically as it currently is, as I could respect that choice, but not as a general rule for ancient buildings in ruins

They will actually [rebuild one part](https://greece.greekreporter.com/2019/05/09/historic-decision-made-to-rebuild-part-of-the-parthenon/) that was lost apparently anyway, the cella that hosted the statue of Athena, take it as you want, that's what the archeologists decided",,/r/europe/comments/eupdze/athens_greece_oc/ffrybpb/,Junkererer,1580168684

677,"&gt; You do know the Scottish parliament voted to unite with England after they went bankrupt, yeah?

you do know that ""they"" were a handful of Scottish lords, so the debt they had incurred to was private, not public. An MP failing to pay his debt doesn't make the state indebted. And the Scottish parliament voted only narrowly for the act of union the third time, after being threatened by Queen Anne and the English parliament. And there were massive riots on the streets of Edinburgh and other Scottish towns when news reached the public.

Essentially the act of union was needed by Queen Anne and the English elite because the so called glorious revolution highlighted the fragility of the personal union of crowns that existed between Scotland and England.

Queen Anne was the last of her dynasty adhering to the Protestant faith and the throne of England would pass on to a German dynasty with no ties to Scotland, the Hanover. 

But Scotland wasn't bound by the same dynastic rules of England, so the tie between the two kingdoms was bound to be broken once the personal union under a common monarch ended.

The act of union was the trick the English elite came up with to retain control over Scotland. And even that was not sufficient. The Catholic Stuarts and the support for an independent Scotland was only crushed 50 years later, with a war on Scottish soil, the ban of tartans and other symbols of Scottish cultural uniqueness for another 50 years and the crush of Highland culture (Highland being the hotbed of resistance against cultural and political forced assimilation).",Südtirol best Tirol,/r/europe/comments/et7ik3/president_von_der_leyen_signs_the_brexit_deal/ffs0j3g/,standy85,1580170182

For example a vacation service which let many poorer germans go on a holiday somewhere else, sometimes a foreign land, but mostly inside of germany. This was a huge thing back then when even day trips from rural areas to bigger cities weren't common. The nazis also had a replacement for unions, which didn't have a say in anything but was still more than the industrialists supported.

For the common worker, the nazis were a huge step up compared to the weimar republic in most labour related ways. One reason why even the SPD (centre left) didn't actively fought for denazification was that many of their members, even higher ups, were nazi party members, who genuinly supported them before the war.

But, as you said, this was exclusively for germans. Other ""races"" weren't quite so happy about that and the common man didn't really care about the injustices, because the nazis were good to him.

685,"First, it's not a flu, not a variant of the influenza virus -- it's a coronavirus, a close relative of SARS.

This is what one might call a rapidly-evolving situation, because nobody's had much time to do work on the thing, so people doing work on this are dumping papers with very preliminary stuff out onto the Internet.

Some of the initial assumptions by official agencies were made based on the assumption that it would act similarly to SARS, since it's a close relative.  They're working on narrowing down numbers now, but the rough take now is that it is less-lethal than SARS -- but still bad news -- but has been spreading much-more-readily than SARS.

Given the urgency of the situation, *The Lancet* has committed to freely-publishing all of the papers she gets on the matter.  [This article](https://www.idsociety.org/globalassets/lancet-jan-24-2020-today-1st-42-patients-ncov.pdf) came out three days ago and lists some things like the approximate time until the first 42 patients studied transitioned to various conditions.  If what you're asking is ""how long until someone can be considered recovered"", the criteria that the Chinese hospitals in the study used until a patient could be discharged was:

&gt; As  of  Jan  22,  2020, 28 (68%)  of  41  patients  have  been  discharged  and  six  (15%)  patients  have  died.  Fitness  for  discharge  was  based  on  abatement  of  fever  for  at  least  10  days,  with  improvement  of  chest  radiographic  evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract.

I don't know how long it takes on average for the fever to break; might be able to derive it from the paper, but if Germany uses the same criteria that China has, it'll be at least ten days after the fever goes away that they'll be out.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/euwmuj/first_case_of_2019ncov_virus_confirmed_in_germany/ffs0vrv/,duisThias,1580170425

In Emilia Lega passed from 233k votes in 2014 to 690k votes this year, and while yes, more people voted in 2020, it's not even twice the amount of 2014 voters, and the right coalition passed from close to 30% to more than 40%, and in Calabria they didn't even partecipate in 2014, so they basically passed from 0 to 95k votes (12%) for a party that some years ago nobody in the south would have voted

One thing I expect is Fratelli d'Italia ""stealing"" some votes from Lega potentially, I already said it when Salvini messed up last summer and had to resign, they basically passed from 4% to 11% in the polls in the last year, they have similar ideas as Salvini with the ""advantage"" of being more openly fascist and being having a ""cleaner"" past compared to Lega from the point of view of southern italian voters, so I expect them to keep growing in the future, it will be interesting to see what M5S does as well",,/r/europe/comments/eujrvo/italys_centerleft_fends_off_salvinis_farright/ffs141p/,Junkererer,1580170583

716,"&gt;I mean this is pretty much the disagreement we've had from the start. I think it's fair to call them socialist even though they don't fit the strict definition - or specifically, I don't think it matters in practice whether they fit the definition, it matters what their motivations are derived from and who they're propped up by.

How do you determine those motivations though? I don't find them saying ""we'll do it, we promise"" to be convincing.

I think the only way to determine if they are really driven by said motivations is by the actions they take.. and I don't think any of the typical examples (USSR, Cuba, Vietnam, etc.) have taken really any convincing actions towards the motivations they claim to have. 

Not once have any of these states tried to actually form a dual power structure with say.. syndicalised unions of workers in their country, not one of them has truly given up state control over private industry to the public in any kind of manner. None of them have even tried to implement ""From each according to their need"" with any kind of conviction; they all had/have landlords, they all had/have private industry as a majority, a lot of their workers rights are utterly laughable for a country that claims to ""support socialism"", I'm probably being more unfair to Cuba here than Vietnam but I'm not prepared to let Cuba off the hook necessarily either.

If these states had actually tried to commit to giving more power to the working class with methods like the ones listed above.. or even just tried to reduce the oppression that the state commits upon the working class I'd be more willing to agree with you -- but from where I'm standing the usual examples for ""socialist countries"" are just state capitalists with red flags and I don't find that convincing whatsoever and I think labelling them ""socialist countries"" or even ""socialist motivated"" when they don't even seem to give a shit about the emancipation of the worker is absolutely and categorically unfair.

&gt;Basically what I'm trying to say that even if I accept your claim at face value, it doesn't matter in practice when socialist action throughout the 20th century has been so incredibly effective at riling up violent revolutions and then seizing power in the hands of the few.

This I won't argue with, the track record for duping the proletariat into your revolution for you then stealing the power in that vacuum for yourself is a track record that should never have happened, and I don't think really many of us are very proud of it. 

There are.. a few good things to be said for them.. but on the whole, nothing much to write home about; but I don't think that means it's going to happen every time. Apropos of that, it's one of the main reasons I fight for anarchist causes -- if you revolt and replace the state with non-hierarchical structures immediately instead of letting a power vacuum exist, you can make good headway on stopping the ""power accumulating in the hands of the few""; look at CNT-FAI in Spain for example. They were not doing bad all things considered until the Fascists crushed them out.

&gt;Then I don't really have a personal issue with you. Also as an aside, I don't think socialism is evil either and that there's definitely a possibility we move to a system resembling some sort of socialism in the future. Right now all the rage seems to be about automation regarding this, but we'll see.

My personal strain is post-labour ancom, if we're going to go for labels here. Automation is a big one for us, we want to reduce human labour to as low as level as we possibly can by exploiting technology as efficiently and ""eco-socialistly"" as possible. I don't see human labour being completely eradicated in my lifetime.. and maybe not even ever, though its the end-goal we idealise, but it certainly can be reduced very very dramatically so that people can live more fulfilling lives without the necessity of spending most of it on labour. 

I truly believe labour stops people from becoming the best version of themselves, and as someone who is neuro-divergent and finds it incredibly difficult to operate in a world where it's ""do labour for capital, or die in the streets"" I'm not massively warm on the idea of ""do labour under socialism, but at least you don't die in the streets because each according to his need"", like it's better but.. it's still labour.

&gt;Wouldn't an universal abolition of private property go kind of hand-in-hand with the abolition of money? Genuine question.

uhhhh, this isn't my area of expertise, you'd be better asking a Mutualist about this kind of thing if you're genuinely interested; they'll be able to give you a far more comprehensive answer. I don't trust myself to give a good and accurate answer on behalf of Mutualists here because I don't think I know enough about their beliefs to educate others about them.

720,"&gt; Preserving something in its current state is vandalism... Ok. 

What you see is the result of vandalism, people not respecting the monument for centuries, scrapping it, stealing its parts etc, and you want to protect this kind of vandalism just because it happened long ago

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which missing parts? The missing parts of 400 B.C? The missing parts of  300 A.D? The missing parts of 1600? How do you know what those missing  parts look like? Why add them back and give the visitor a false sense of  the buildings history? 

Probably the original greek temple at its state during the golden age of the city or whatever? I would have to look into it if I was tasked with restoring it

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To preserve the memory of the fire, you wouldn't need more than a  plaque. To preserve the Destruction of the Parthenon in the 1680's by  the Venetians on the other hand, is a completely different matter.

So if some terrorists crashed into the Tour Eiffel or the Louvre with a plane you would let them be ruins? It would be a quite significant event

What about buildings that simply decayed due to not being maintained?

What's happening in the present is obviously not history, but it will be at some point, and if you're coherent you should value both current history and ""future history"" in the same way, and us demolishing buildings when they become decrepid is akin to vandalism as they could have a great archeological value 2-300 years from now according to your reasoning

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To keep something preserved exactly is far more difficult and respectful as far as I'm concerned. 

You're still interfering though, a lot of buildings have been falling into ruin for centuries, now we stopped that natural process by restoring them

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Are you telling me Medieval life is not worth studying and preserving remnants of?

Medieval life is worth studying, preserving the remnants of peasants stealing marble pieces and pissing on monuments maybe not, you can study those things in books

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It can tell us about what state these monuments were in during that time, material conditions etc. 

It can just tell us what state these monuments was until modern times. For example, a building initially built in, let's say, 200BC, is worked on, changed, damaged etc etc for centuries, and in 1900 people stop chaging it and start preserving it exactly as it is

In 2000 its state will tell us about how it looked like in 1900, not before, and if you say ""well, there are still some older parts even if they kept changing it until 1900"" then I could say the same thing for a fully restored building, the old parts would stay there, plus thanks to the advacements in the last century we have plenty of ways to keep track of how a building looked like at any age in form of data, 3D models etc etc

I mean, a big hole in the roof may tell us about one specific event, but what if there was a smaller hole in the missing part? What if there was a mosaic built in some specific period where now there's a hole? So even at their current state you can't really tell what happened throughout the whole building's life

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to argue about the real vandals go where they talk about the turkish government demolishing an entire 10.000 years old city to build a dam or similar stuff, I was downvoted and told that they have too many 10k old cities so they don't really need them when I tried to defend the city months ago

What I'm talking about would preserve the original pieces while completing what's missing and you could still see the state of the building in different ages thanks to technology and as I said above even the current state of the ruins don't really tell the whole story because history itself erased older history

Seeing the previous state of a monument with some damages done throughout history is useful from a knowledge point of view (like if there was a hole somewhere, if a statue was cut in half etc), which can be done through 3D models and stuff, and studies by archeologists and other scientists, which could be done as well as the original pieces would still be there

The advantage for the visitors would be being able to visit a place as it would have looked like centuries/millennia ago and being able to feel the same sense of scale and majesty ancient people felt, which, yes, could be done through 3D models, but it's not the same feeling by a wide margin, while the usefulness of keeping the ruins is to know what happened at different points in time, being in awe when visiting places like the Parthenon is not due to the ruins, it's due to the original plan of the building and the few pieces that survived

Restoring stuff that is missing can help in studying history as well btw, to understand how people of the time behaved and similar stuff",,/r/europe/comments/eupdze/athens_greece_oc/ffrnbor/,Junkererer,1580161606

784,"&gt;Probably the original greek temple at its state during the golden age of the city or whatever?

Why?

Why that specific period?

What makes that period 'superior' to the later periods, to the point where you can just cast them aside as if they don't matter?

What gives you the authority to decide which period of the building you're recreating?

Don't you think you're invalidating those later periods by pretending they never existed? Pretending that the Parthenon was never burned by the Heruli, that Emperor Julian never rebuilt it, that it never was a church, a mosque, a ruin.

Why is the Parthenon, the Pagan Temple of 400 B.C superior to the Parthenon of 400 A.D, or the church of 600 A.D, or the Mosque of 1600 A.D, or the ruin of today?

I've asked you this three times, and you still can't answer this, because it is impossible. You're imposing your own preference on a historical monument with no regard for the damages it might cause.

&gt;So if some terrorists crashed into the Tour Eiffel or the Louvre with a plane you would let them be ruins? It would be a quite significant event

You did not read what I wrote about that at all, did you?

&gt;You're still interfering though, a lot of buildings have been falling into ruin for centuries, now we stopped that natural process by restoring them

Keeping something preserved is preferable to allowing it to fall apart. It's the most respectful option and requires the least amount of aesthetic interference.

&gt;preserving the remnants of peasants stealing marble pieces and pissing on monuments maybe not, you can study those things in books

Again, what gives you the authority over what history is worth preserving and what isn't?
Are you the deity of art or something?

&gt;It can just tell us what state these monuments was until modern times

...Yes, but the medieval damage or remains can also tell us what kind of state it was in when that damage was made.

The Hagia Sophia for example contains Viking Runes in its gallery, which can tell us alot about how the space was used and what kind of people occupied it. The Colosseum contains holes from medieval looters all over it, which tells us that these holes were looted by medieval looters, but also that these holes used to contain bronze support to strengthen the structure.

&gt;What I'm talking about would preserve the original pieces while completing what's missing 

What does it mean for a structure like the Parthenon to be 'complete'?

Again, you're basing its 'completeness' off of your own personal tastes. Not realizing of course that the building already is complete (for now), as it has undergone its various transformations and developments across centuries.

There is nothing to complete, the building has been like this for 400 years.

&gt;Seeing the previous state of a monument with some damages done throughout history is useful from a knowledge point of view (like if there was a hole somewhere, if a statue was cut in half etc), which can be done through 3D models

By the same logic we can recreate how these buildings looked like originally in 3D models (which people do) without destroying what is already there, or altering it with fake additions.

An educated fantasy, sure, but a fantasy nonetheless, as opposed to the real thing.

Secondly, you'll destroy the archeological value these sites have. You'll potentially destroy or replace original stones, and clean centuries of wear and tear which could potentially reveal new secrets in the future. 

Thirdly, you'll be making a pretty big value jugement by suggesting that the **entire** history of the building after it was ruined is irrelevant, or somehow not worth preserving in comparison to its earlier history.
Who are you to judge what history should or should not be worthy of being preserved?
The mortar damage, the dust/dirt, the imperfections are just as much a part of that buildings history as its sculptures and columns.

Another case are buildings where their destruction is somewhat relevant historically, like Pompei due to the eruption, or the Colosseum as I said above, but is the fact that one of the columns of the Parthenon fell down randomly, during an earthquake, a pillage or whatever in the VIII century or something really relevant?

Anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union was deemed unlawful. Stalin had tried to make it explicitly clear why that was in this statement.

 “National and racial chauvinism is a vestige of the misanthropic customs characteristic of the period of cannibalism. Anti-semitism, as an extreme form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism. Anti-semitism is of advantage to the exploiters as lightning conductor that deflects the blows aimed by the working people at capitalism.  Anti-semitism is dangerous for the working people as being a false path that leads them off the right road and lands them in the jungle. Hence Communists, as consistent internationalists cannot be irreconcilable, sworn enemies of anti-semitism.” - J. Stalin

There was anti-semitism amongst the population of the Soviet Union. Many of rural population weren’t a part of the communist party continued to hold conservative views.
The question is why would the Soviet Union commit atrocities against the Jewish people of many of the founding members of the communist party in the Soviet Union were Jewish themselves whilst also deliberately making it unlawful to commit anti-Semitic acts?

There is section talking about Jewish people in the Union. He said although it wasn’t perfect there was no systemic problem of anti-semitism as there are in other places.
https://archive.org/details/HumanRightsInTheSovietUnion/page/n5

There was also a push for a autonomous region within the union settled by Jewish people so they can have nation to call they’re own but it was proposed to be in Ukraine and the Ukrainian Soviet Republic rejected the idea so they planned to have it be in Siberia instead although the plan was stifled by Zionism which convinced many Jews of the diaspora to go to Israel abandoning their self determined autonomous region.

1154,"&gt;the EU isn't even the one getting the better deal in FTAs some of the time

So please provide a source for this. The EU is from I understand it not only the holder of the biggest tariff-free network of economies but also the one to strike the most comprehensive FTAs.

&gt;Also do you have a source on services rarely being included?

""Services trade liberalisation commitments in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and existing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) do not go very far, because governments prefer to retain their ‘policy space’, which provides flexibility for changing regulations anytime they want.
Services trade negotiations are different from goods trade negotiations because services trade barriers are all about regulations, and these are much more complex than tariffs to negotiate.""

https://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/uktpo/publications/the-uks-future-services-trade-deals-with-non-eu-countries-a-reality-check/

The reason is much simpler though, because since services have never been a part of WTO rules, they are not standardized between countries. So discussing services is usually too complicated for small countries. FTAs are much easier to strike with smaller or developing countries because these have less comprehensive services regulation to begin with, and possibly even yield from adopting the services regulation of a more comprehensive system than their own.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/eumsba/brexit_no_10_insists_fishing_waters_will_be_under/ffqfh82/,RassyM,1580133040

I think you again missed the word *extreme*. This map is about *extreme poverty*. 

Of course, the numbers are likely to be not exactly precise, as with people on periphery of the society it is hard to make any precise statistics on their ""income""/""consumation"" because it's not common to have evidence for all minor social benefits they consume.

They may somewhat participate in grey economy, they may use some facitilities in a way too cheap and trivial to be counted (Should taking healthy drinking water from the public fountain be counted? It's considerable luxury from the viewpoint of some third world countries.) Some part of being very wealthy country may be exactly the thing that some support for poor/homeless people is freely available and without evidence.

And of course, dumpster diver living in wealthy lavish society has much better time than dumpster diver living in poor thrifty society. But that's not something that will show in statistics.

From the title. How is this ""christian conservative""? This is just vanilla progressive environmentalism. Rebranding it doesn't change what it is.

Christian conservative parties tend to be more concerned with preserving cultural values.

&gt;In contrast to Green liberalism, a conservative approach to the environment rests on the belief that only local solutions, not vague, unenforceable global commitments, will lead to effective improvements in environmental protection.

No, this isn't conservatism. This is the (actual) liberal/libertarian desire for small/local government, with a green policy spin on it.

1358,"I think this is at the core of the issue: German remembrance was created for those who actually witnessed WW II or directly knew perpetrators or victims. It was reasonable to remind them they have this special responsibility. 

Now, most everyone from back then is dead. I talked to one KZ survivor when I was young and I am old now. For millenials, it's just history, and they cannot feel that feeling of special responsibility because it has nothing to do whatsoever with their lives.

While I applaud the efforts of my country to not sweep the genocide under the carpet, and while I want officials to keep the thought alive, we need to pivot this, and fast. It must be accepted much more that individuals feel no personal connection to the crimes of their grand-grandparents and that the current Germany is a completely different country to the one back then.

As von Weizsäcker, one of our better presidents, put it: ""There is no such thing as the guilt or innocence of an entire
nation. Guilt is, like innocence, not collective, but personal. [...] The vast majority of today's population were either children then or had not been born. They cannot profess a guilt of their own for crimes that they did not commit. No discerning person can expect them to wear a penitential robe simply because they are Germans."" he then goes on that all Germans should keep alive the memories, but that was back in 1985 - I doubt this was working back then and is going to work less and less well going forward.

If we overdo it with the individual responsibility, it's only going to strengthen denialists.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/eucqoz/1_in_5_germans_think_the_holocaust_gets_too_much/ffq3ww9/,ABoutDeSouffle,1580119068

there is currently about 5 million refugees in Turkey and millions in Syria under Turkish protected zones. BUT let's not even count them.

AND don't forget I'am making this math with 3.5 million people.

You can't even pay for their food expenditure with 28€ per month mate let alone the free education and free healthcare etc. we provided to them, the camps that WE build. OR the people we also take care in SYRIA so they don't become refugees in Turkey or in EU.

Although these historical accounts must be taken with a grain of salt, it seems weird that humanity would exist for 40,000 years before it decided to genocide each other. And it would be improving techniques along the way.

The 1975 Cambodian genocide is especially horrific and one part is described as:

If Turkey takes a migrant back, the new one will be settled in any of the EU countries. As long as Turkey does not take immigrants back the irregular migrants stay trapped in Greece as they aren't allowed to leave the country (and I have the impression not even the Greek islands).

Later enjoying a beer on a bench beside that lake, with the sunset turning the castle to luminescent gold, was another.

I love this little city and highly recommend a visit. Its art museum is excellent and the Pension am Theater was a great place to stay and eat.

1616,"Highly irregular grammar + everything has a gender.

You know English can few forms of one verb, and these can be irregular? E.g. to go, going, went, gone? In Polish it's not only verbs, but also nouns and adjectives. And more than four forms.

Also, perfect and imperfect aren't tenses... but two forms of nearly each verb. Which are different, and again, these differences are irregular. 

So, remember 'to go, going, went, gone' example above? In Polish it will be: iść, idę, idziemy, idziesz, idziecie, idzie, idą, szedłem, szłam, szliśmy, szłyśmy, szedłeś, szłaś, szliście, szłyście, szedł, szła, szło, szli, szły, szedłbym, szłabym, szlibyśmy, szłybyśmy, szedłbyś, szłabyś, szlibyście, szłybyście, szedłby, szłaby, szłoby, szliby, szłyby, idźmy, idź, idźcie, idący, idąca, idące; pójść, pójdę, pójdziemy, pójdziesz, pójdziecie, pójdzie, pójdą, poszedłem, poszłam, poszliśmy, poszłyśmy, poszedłeś, poszłaś, poszliście, poszłyście, poszedł, poszła, poszło, poszli, poszły, poszedłbym, poszłabym, poszlibyśmy, poszłybyśmy, poszedłbyś, poszłabyś, poszlibyście, poszłybyście, poszedłby, poszłaby, poszłoby, poszliby, poszłyby, pójdźmy, pójdź, pójdźcie, poszedłszy. Not counting alternative forms (e.g. poszłybyście = byście poszły; szliśmy = żeśmy szli = myśmy szli etc.).

And here is an example of a noun: English - dog. Polish - pies, psy, psa, psów, psu, psom, psem, psami, psie, 	psach.

Of course, there are few things which are actually easier. First, pronunciation is highly regular. Second, word order is generally free - SVO is a default one, but every other combination will be still correct and having same meaning. Third, we have no articles.

1769,"&gt;It isn't valid because beautiful buildings are objectively better than ugly ones.

Thats true, but good luck finding an objective definition of beautu. I dont find that wing of the building beautiful either but I also dont give a fuck what it looks like, i live in europe which has millions of beautiful historic buildings to look at. 


&gt;Who complains that their government buildings look too nice? 

Lots and lots of people actually, all throughout history. You only have an issue with this building because its in Germany which is a rather wealthy and stable country with low corruption. If the government of a poor african nation were to spend all the public money on a lavish parliament building you would probably have an issue with that. So essentially your issue here is that the germans have chosen not to spend their taxpayer money on something which you personally might find pleasing to the eye when confronted with it on reddit sitting in your computer chair and I cant fault them for that. 


&gt;In 2020 we can't make beautiful buildings for cheap? The Milan Duomo was made by peasant retards with wood scaffolding.

The milano Duomo took *500 years* to finish and has sucked up over 50 million in upkeep and renovation just in the last several years. Its upkeep is 12.5 million a year. It is also not universally considered to be ""beautiful"": John Ruskin commented acidly that the cathedral steals ""from every style in the world: and every style spoiled. The cathedral is a mixture of Perpendicular with Flamboyant, the latter being peculiarly barbarous and angular, owing to its being engrafted, not on a pure, but a very early penetrative Gothic … The rest of the architecture among which this curious Flamboyant is set is a Perpendicular with horizontal bars across: and with the most detestable crocketing, utterly vile. Not a ray of invention in a single form… Finally the statues all over are of the worst possible common stonemasons’ yard species, and look pinned on for show"" (From wikipedia).


Not saying that everyone agrees with Ruskin, but it goes to show that what one person finds hideous another finds beautiful. In the end though, the important thing is that the building serves its purpose, is cheap and is cheap to maintain. There is beauty in efficiency, and that is something the germans appreciate perhaps above all other nationalities. 


If you have a good idea for a beautiful yet cheap building, become an architect and realise it. I bet you I can find 10,000 bored armchair experts that will tell me your wonderful design is an abomination and an eyesore, and will ask why we cant build beautiful buildings in 2020 just like you have.

The three countries who wrote the Atlantic charter all either engaged in or facilitated ethnic cleansing under their then-current or later leaders, and you think it is meant as anything other than a pretext for arbitrary action? 

&gt;	War crimes and crimes against humanity are not a private matter of a state.

Beside idiot foreigners want to meddle in matter which do not concern them, and because foreign politicians think humanitarian excuses play better with local voters than “they’ve got lots of lovely oil”. When was the last time a senior officer (let alone a politician) on the winning side ended up hanged for war crimes or crimes against peace? 

&gt;	If you kill and violently expel parts of your population, you will face consequences as serbia did

My country has nothing worth conquering (which is a problem, because we need to acquire mines, farms, and so on) and nuclear weapons. We’d probably be treated worse than China is for their ethnic cleansing, but nowhere near as badly as Serbia. 

&gt;	Ukrain did not opresse, kill or violently expeled ethnic russians at any point. But If they would have, they also would face consequences.

The Russians say they did and they got the consequences anyway. 

&gt;	I'll end this here cause you are obviously a right wing troll.

No, I want total internal sovereignty so that if a government of the people ever gets into power it  can implement left-wing polIcies without external interference, I’ve just got the sense and integrity to accept that total means total and that I have no moral basis for opposing America’s inevitable attempts to impose Freedom and Democracy if I support interference in any other country for what they do.

&gt;ATHENS – “Not a single threat against Greece and Cyprus’ sovereign rights will be accepted” stated French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in an interview with the Sunday edition of Kathimerini newspaper, referring to the importance of EastMed pipeline for Europe and for the tension created by the exploitation of the wealth sources in eastern Mediterranean.  
&gt;  
&gt;“France and EU have strongly supported Athens and Nicosia against these threats” the French Minister said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Le Maire said that Greece is on a good course and now can see to the future with optimism. “The country is again on the course of growth and the unemployment is dropping. Greece has restored the investors’ trust and this is good news. It will help the growth and will improve the tax revenues”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding the reduction of primary surplus target, he said that “Greece and the Greek people have assumed serious commitments. I was pleased to see that Greece was in condition to leave the programme in June 2018 following a Eurogroup decision. However, Greece’s public finances should become more sustainable. Greece is on the right course; it has met the primary surplus target for 2018 and should continue on this way”.

1941,"No they're not. The study talks about kids injuring themselves or getting sick, neither which is related to health (genetic health, being born to whatever age of mother). It's related to how much time a mother spends with the child, and that is the result of the current culture, not the age. Obviously if you spend more time with your child, the child will less likely manage to hurt itself. 

Speaking in terms of pure health and genetics, children for women over 40 have increased chances for a large number of genetic conditions and disease, not to mention the possibility of not being able to get pregnant at all or carry the pregnancy to term. 

Of course leave it to ""journalists"" to have no idea what they're talking about.

1948,"&gt;And finally, if you are afraid of stone\stucco veneer so much, don't look up Ancient Roman structures. The way they put up concrete walls to hide them with brick, and then to hide the brick with stucco, and then to hide it all with rustication paint will be a shock you won't recover from.

Mate, I've studied this for years, I know it better than you do. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt due to bad image quality, but some of those walls look like painted concrete, not stucco. Sadly I can bet whatever you want that these buildings are insanely expensive to maintain due to high wall porosity (damaging the stucco, which falls), no insulation (0) which contributes to water damage through infiltration (and if they're made of brick it's actually worse) and an absurdly unsustainable energy cost. These problems can be solved, and I would also bet these buildings have been fixed with interior insulation, although patches can't solve everything, and no, ""best quality brick"" barely means anything, especially when repurposed. We keep old buildings because we value them, but if they were to fall down few people would doubt in pushing for a new alternative. I am in no way saying that the reconstruction was necessary however, because I understand the exceptional times in which it was built. However, it is an exception, not the norm, and sadly this also means bad building quality due to trying to imitate an architecture that already wasn't fit for its time.",Fake Country once again,/r/europe/comments/eu6xnv/medieval_houses_of_warsaw_old_town_reconstructed/ffobkcn/,AleixASV,1580075951

1975,"&gt;I'm always amazed by the apparently weak infrastructure in the UK outside of London. I think a lot of the effect is due to the UK being far more centralised than most european countries.

I'm not sure that's the case. Roads are devolved in Wales but if anything there is less development now since devolution in 1999.

In the 1990s the UK government began work on converting the A465 into a dual carriageway (2 lanes each way separated by a central reservation). The Welsh assembly took over in 1999. 21 years later and work is still ongoing in stages, with the final sections not even started yet. 

Also in the 1990s the UK government built a new bridge over the river Severn to increase capacity on the M4 motorway between south Wales and England. The next section to be upgraded was supposed to be the Brynglas Tunnels, which are a choke point on the motorway. Again responsibility passed to the Welsh government in 1999, last year, having spent 20 years looking at plans, they decided not to bother with the upgrade at all. 

There is tremendous opposition to new roads in the UK amongst planners and campaigners who believe that upgrades are pointless because they just generate more traffic. The Scottish government built a new road bridge across the Forth a few years ago. They deliberately restricted it to 2 lanes rather than 3 so that it wouldn't increase the amount of traffic, and their latest plans say that road improvements must not result in more traffic.",,/r/europe/comments/eu7qf9/motorways_in_european_countries_oc/ffocy85/,WhiteSatanicMills,1580076405

That's the problem with making any claims on responsibility, it requires cutting up trends for political uses.

Tobacco is definitely no different from other drugs, and the only reason it's allowed is probably some cultural stuff.

So:

income tax to ~20363 euro/year  = 18%, above is 32% . So less than 1700 euro/month,and your tax of all above it is 32%

tax free earlier was about 735 euro/year, now complicated - for earning 1900 euro/year giving no more than about 338 euro tax 
refund, but for people earning more than 3095 euro/year  (so having any stable job) it is no more,than about 130 euro tax refund.
Tax refund above 1700 euro/month (quite not so easy to achieve) almost no exists.

Value added tax : 23% like in Ireland,but food quite less (5%).In theory,I havn't seen it on receipt,probably because tax office with ""law interpretations"" block its use.

Social security shared between employer and employee to hide its costs: 619 euro/month declared as minimal salary, emploee gets 457 euro/month from it. (And employers declare those minimal salary cost them really 645.4 euro/month). You pay taxes from declared ""brutto"" salary. You earn more - you pay more for social security system.

2114,"&gt;Giving the family members of the diplomat diplomatic immunity isn't really dodgy.

There's a difference between absolute immunity for things and immunity for diplomatic work but not other crimes. Similarly immunity for say something the UK doesn't consider a crime (like let's say if the British ambassador mocked Islam in Pakistan) or as you say to stop families being threatened. However people who are not the ambassador or have tenuous connections to such rights should not have blanket immunity (such ""levels"" exist in the laws of diplomatic protection)

&gt;Regarding her immunity in this case I see that there are different opinions, with the CPS arguing that she didn't have immunity in the first place, although I'm not too sure I would follow their opinion.

I'm not sure what qualifications you have but if the CPS considers the immunity to not apply, their opinion based on the facts and evidence of the case is more valid than your, currently unsubstantiated, opinion",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/eu8vjh/us_rejects_harry_dunn_death_extradition_request/ffn18g9/,Tuarangi,1580060958

The story is unofficial, its major player died in 2018.

Czech Ministry of Interior has migration department and it was led for 24 years by certain Tomáš Haišman. He didn't like migration, repeatedly warned against it and tried to reduce it as much as he could.


In 2015, when it was clear Czech politicians don't know what to do, he started his own initiative, together with handful of individuals from his department and from secret services.  On social networks they spread information (in migrant languages), how Czech Republic is hostile toward migrants, how it provides no welfare and so on. Every little anti-immigration incident was eagerly publicized.

It worked. Migrants and pro-immigration activists alike shared these horror stories and warned each other. These warnings spread like a fire.

As a result migrants avoided Czech Republic as a plague. For example, there was once a website giving advises to migrants, how to get most out of this or that country. Czech Republic was grayed, there was nothing about it, as if we didn't exist at all.

2253,"With respect, you don't seem to understand Social Mobility. It does not ""set standards to the lowest common denominator"", it is based on the average ability of an individual to move up, or down, in social status. 

It would actually be more difficult to have a high upward average in social mobility if it was the case that no one could climb up to the next level until everyone else is on their level. Due to the apparent ""nobody left behind"" culture you speak of. 

As for raping wallets, you're clearly biased toward a capitalist ideology. These statistics prove that your favoured ideology is flawed. For example allowing Jeff Bezos to rape the taxpayers wallets by having them pay for the education of his employees, the transport infrastructure that he depends on for his company's success and the subsidies that many of his staff require from welfare because he isn't willing to pay them a livable wage is clearly good for him. But it doesn't seem to be benefiting the majority of Americans who have stunted social mobility despite working longer hours. The reality is that a few individuals are taking advantage of millions of people.

News of the week: Troubles at the top of the Flemish public broadcaster [VRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaamse_Radio-_en_Televisieomroeporganisatie).

* It all started when VRT CEO Paul Lembrechts tried to fire the director for media and production Peter Claes. Lembrechts and the other directors have a problem with Claes because he went behind their backs to negotiate the future of the VRT with the VRT's private competitors [DPG Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPG_Media) and [SBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS_Broadcasting_Group#Belgium) and with the Flemish nationalist conservative party [N-VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance), which leads the current [Flemish government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambon_Government), responsible for the VRT.
* The dismissal of Claes was rejected by the VRT's board of directors, which is politically appointed according to the vote share of the Flemish parties. Flemish Minister for Media Benjamin Dalle (CD&amp;V) intervened in the crisis and fired Lembrechts as CEO, while Claes is (temporarily) put on non-active.
* Dalle's intervention drew some criticism, mostly from the leftwing opposition and from the VRT's trade unions. They say the dismissal of Lembrechts was politically motivated because opposed the budget cuts the Flemish government plans for the VRT, while Claes was more pragmatic about it.
* The unions have announced a strike at the VRT this monday.

The whole argument is that these are not simple ""right-wing extremists"" which some very users on this thread have tried to argue is benign, and is simply a natural case of people having their opinions.

""Neo-nazis"" have the added distinction of being dangerous and comparatively incompatible with any democratic societies, they're a terrorist group. That's why the term neo-nazis is used, because it's not as easy to brush away.

2326,"The Maison de Verre (French for House of Glass) was built from 1928 to 1932 in Paris, France. The design was a collaboration among Pierre Chareau (a furniture and interiors designer), Bernard Bijvoet (a Dutch architect working in Paris since 1927) and Louis Dalbet (craftsman metalworker). Much of the intricate moving scenery of the house was designed on site as the project developed.

The house is notable for its splendid architecture, but it may be more well known for another reason. It was built on the site of a much older building which the patron had purchased and intended to demolish. Much to his or her chagrin, however, the elderly tenant on the top floor of the building absolutely refused to sell, and so the patron was obliged to completely demolish the bottom three floors of the building and construct the Maison de Verre underneath, all without disturbing the original top floor.

""No one has the right to use the Holocaust for political purposes. This is a remark for the left, for the right, for everyone,"" said Chief Rabbi of Poland Michael Schudrich in an interview with Onet. ""I always try to be gentle, but it must be made clear: this is a lie,"" he said when asked about the words of Vladimir Putin, in which the Russian president accused Poles of responsibility for the Holocaust. ""This is disgusting,"" he added.

&amp;#x200B;

The Chief Rabbi of Poland admitted that he did not know why Putin was saying such things right now. It seems that he wants to build tension between two countries that have good relations - he assessed. He added that good relations between Poland and Israel are contrary to the interests of Russia, which may be the reason for the behavior of the Russian leader. Putin is a smart man. He is lying, but he is clever, 'said Schudrich. There are people who want to make a row and there are people who want to make peace - he explained.

&amp;#x200B;

The interview also touched on the celebrations related to the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz camp. The main celebrations should take place in Poland. The meeting in Jerusalem gathered more prime ministers and heads of state, but it is more important to me that the celebrations in Oświęcim will be attended by over 200 survivors from the Holocaust. This is the last moment to pay tribute to these people and therefore their participation should be more important than the participation of politicians - said Schudrich.

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday in Oświęcim there will be celebrations related to the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the German Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. The event will be hosted by President Andrzej Duda. Over 50 state delegations confirmed their participation in the celebrations. As the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum informed, the most important guests of the celebration will be camp prisoners and Holocaust survivors from the United States, Canada, Israel, Australia and several European countries.",Silesia :illuminati:,/r/europe/comments/eu6ya1/the_chief_rabbi_of_poland_on_putins_words_this_is/ffm18i3/,dhanter,1580046903

Moreover, putting drugs into the same category as fast food, alcohol and tobacco is a big mistake. There are many types of drugs that fit in different categories, and fast food, alcohol and tobacco are way different as well. (note: I will not talk about addictions in the next part, and will treat every addiction as equal) Fast food is only a danger to yourself, and only veeeerrry indirectly affects other citizens (cardiac arrest on a crowded highway, both unlikely and indirect). Not a lot of drugs would fit in here (can't think of one at least). This is fine for public consumption. 

Alcohol causes no direct harm to other people (toxins are contained within yourself), yet it may cause aggression, for example. Many non-smoke drugs fit into this category too (XTC). These are all not fine for public usage. 

Smoking (tobacco) has a direct (harnful or not) effect on bystanders. This should in now way be allowed anywhere near a public place (inside or something should be cool though). Mostly smoke-drugs fit on this category.

&gt;That is a price I'm willing to pay for freedom.
&gt;I just want people to make their own choices, their choices can have bad consequences for them selves and families.

Freedom isn't being allowed to do anything you want. You can't have rights without laws, which serve to protect others and yourself. Families have rights, too, and your bad choices shouldn't bring them into danger. If your bad choices have bad consequences for your family, they have the right to be protected from your bad choices. Moreover, having asthma, I should also be protected from tobacco-consumption. You have the right to be protected from murderers.

2399,"I am a bit short with you, yes. You wanted to know about ""what politicians have been using the EU as a scapegoat, and for what issues"", and the quick and dirty answer is, as everyone knows, all the politicians, for all the issues.

It is such an easy thing to google, too, and gives lots of results. [Cameron and Osbourne blamed EU for Britains poor economy last decade](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/10/cameron-blame-europe-strategy-eurozone), and the British government was quick to blame EU for the horsemeat scandal, [despite their own shortcomings in the case](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/12/horsemeat-scandal-european-regulation-changes).

So when you're asking a question, where everyone knows the answer, it's either because you're too lazy to google, or you're trying some argumentative trick, where you set up very specific conditions on something, that you want other people to google - not to prove a point, but just to exhaust those you see as ""opponents"", so you can ""just ask questions"", in peace.

I'm not trying to piss you off. I'm open to the idea that you didn't know that this was a known and hated method - look up ""J.A.Q.ing off"" if you don't believe me - and that you just had an idea that looked like the same thing.

I know it's just anecdotal evidence, but it's a story I'm hearing a lot from lots of different people.

We won't, and nothing fundamentally bad will come out of it. 2 years will pass before the implementation deadline, and then we'll just keep paying fees for late implementation.

Happens all the time in EU, and nobody will sanction anyone for that.

&gt;like the rule of law.

Hungary will block any article 7 sanctions towards Poland, and several other countries such as Czech Republic or Lithuania have also proclaimed thst they will not support any sanctions.

Sanctions need to be unanimous according to the current legal framework, therefore it won't happen. Deal with it.

2559,"&gt;London (CNN)Prince Harry and his wife Meghan began a new life in Canada last week, having stepped down as senior royals and left the UK. The couple's departure has forced a heated debate on a problem that many say the country is failing to face up to: racism. People from ethnic minority backgrounds make up 19.5% of the population of England and Wales. But some people who identify with this community say that when they call out their experiences of racism, they are shut down. By white British people. ""The white person in this debate always centers it on themselves,"" author and broadcaster Afua Hirsch told CNN. ""It would make more sense if somebody said: I haven't got a lived experience of racism. I would like to understand your perspective.""  
&gt;  
&gt;But many of those who have dared to point out that racism is a factor in the Sussexes' recent move have been publicly slammed for doing so. On the BBC political debate show Question Time, university lecturer Rachel Boyle, who identifies as black, said the UK press ""have torn \[Meghan\] to pieces"" because of racism.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hirsch, a former barrister who is of African heritage, was abused online after writing an opinion piece for the New York Times on the racism directed towards Meghan. She was also berated on TV by Piers Morgan, host of the popular breakfast TV show Good Morning Britain.  
&gt;  
&gt;In December, successful British rapper Stormzy came under fire when, after an Italian newspaper asked him if the UK was still racist today, he replied ""definitely, 100%."" The musician added that racism in the country had worsened under the leadership of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has previously been criticized for making racist remarks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two decades on, black people in England and Wales are still 40 times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched under so-called ""section 60"" checks that allow police to search a person without suspicion, according to a 2019 report by civil rights charity Liberty.

2572,"Ah ... statista is a site that collects statistics, they always give their source. I often use them to refer to German official data, because it's easier to find it on statista than on all the individual official websites.

The page I linked to was from a survey conducted for the EU commission, for their special report 458 ""Attitudes of Europeans towards tobacco and electronic cigarettes"". On the page I linked you also see: ""Details: Europe; TNS; March 2017; 276,901 respondents; Face-to-face interview"" to see the company, time and manner of the polling.

The WHO uses these kind of data for their own report. If you look at the [2017 WHO report itself](https://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2017/en/) \- picking out our countries because those are the ones we know best:

France LCI 22.0 mean 27.4 UCI 33.7 (2014 Health Barometer data)

Germany LCI 20.3 mean 24.4 UCI 28.9 (2013 Microcensus data)

(LCI: lower credible interval, UCI: upper credible interval)

Interestingly, they have [another page based on 2015 data](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.sdg.3-a-viz?lang=en), which is used in the [wiki page for prevalence of tobacco use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_use), which is nowhere in their report. The closest I can get for finding the numbers is [Prevalence of smoking any tobacco product among persons aged &gt;= 15 years](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/prevalence-of-smoking-any-tobacco-product-among-persons-aged-=-15-years), which is a Bayesian model aiming to forecast the trend. ""Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a  particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other  countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is  “borrowed” from countries in the same UN subregion."" 

Now, the numbers don't really fit in with other survey data, and sadly they don't give their actual sources so I can't check what they've done that easily. 

Oh, and I just found [OECD stats on daily smoking](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/214300/umfrage/anteil-der-raucher-an-der-bevoelkerung-ausgewaehlter-laender/), and one interesting bit here is that France reports more smokers in 2017 than in 2015.

My father had just helped shipped a boat (some 22’ Chapperel) by container overseas (from US to Croatia) to him the winter before and we were breaking the boat in that summer. 

These tunnels were carved into the side of the hill and are made of concrete. There are slopes that go upward on both sides making it easy to climb. At some point about ~40’ there is a platform where the slopes kind of join together, and that’s the highest we jumped from. I remember noticing that the skin on the bottom of my feet was kind of torn, and I had bruises around my knees the next day.

The platform we jumped from was higher than the sailboat that was docked next us. Great memories, I remember the owner of the sailboat cheering me to jump bc I was scared af, but we all really wanted to do it.

2752,"&gt;Huh? Decriminalisation and legalisation is exactly what allows for rehabilitation.

Rehabilitation is the process of reintegration of the person into social life, you can do it whatever prohibition exists or not, because rehabilitation of criminal do not really that different from alcohol or drug rehabilitation.

&gt; The reason people cannot get rehabilitated today is because they're treated like a criminal. 

No, the reason is that people think that they will stop using drugs if they have no access to drugs, which is not true.

&gt; That's why the statistics all point in the same direction. 

Again, statistics is unreliable. If you used arrests as the way to determine the number of drug addicts and after decriminalization this number dropped it's not like drug addicts disappeared. That's why policies + statistics should be the way to determine whatever it working or not.

With ‘parental pin’, I would have committed suicide at age 16

**I do not wish anyone that cold feeling in August or feel that you are not worthy of being loved**

I grew up in a family that *was not very Catholic or right-wing*, although I was deeply conservative in moral matters as I was a conservative in Extremadura I was born in 1982, **where being a homosexual was worse than being a drug addict**. I know that because I was a child I often heard my parents affirm that comparison between sexual orientation and drug addiction. My father **became an energum** when Bibi Andersen, Miguel Bosé or Jesús Vázquez appeared on television, **who in my teens were the only LGBT referents who appeared on television**.

&amp;#x200B;

**""What a fucking bullshit,""** my father threw Jesus Vázquez when I was between 15 and 16 years old. In truth, he told television. **I knew I was gay since I had reason, but I didn't even know what was happening to me. In my house nobody had said that it was forbidden to be homosexual, but a series of corrections and reprimands, to gestures considered unmanly, since I was little I was guessed that it was not normal and that the worst thing that could happen to my family was not to have a junkie son, but one fag. I was the lucky one, imagine the joy.**

&amp;#x200B;

With 15 years I stopped leaving home. That is, I stopped having friends, staying on weekends and developing a normalized social life as a teenager of that age. I went everywhere just because **I was afraid that anyone would discover my secret, sneak up on my parents and they would throw me out of the house with the post and a gift beating**. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I went to bed at night and prayed a lot for heterosexual dawn or simply no dawn**. I masturbated thinking of girls unsuccessfully, because I was unable to feel sexual desire for women. Every time I tried, **the inner burden and the desire to get out of the way increased.**

&amp;#x200B;

With 16 years, most of the school's classmates had already taken their first rounds, but I swam. I became an asexual person because I was afraid to show myself. I was disgusted, I showered and rubbed with rage after every masturbation with male thoughts and I imagined an uprooted future, expelled from home, without friends, without family and become a stinker. **In adolescence, just at the moment in which human beings shaped our personality, I realized that, if he showed me what he was like, nobody would love me**.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I write this, I get a chill that takes me back 20 or 25 years ago and **I do not wish it to anyone, not even Santiago Abascal or Pablo Casado,** **who these days with his parental pin have made me return to my adolescence full of pain, loneliness and abandonment for an environment educated in hatred of** ***fagS***.

&amp;#x200B;

Paradoxically, the first person who made me feel that I had the right to be happy, that **I was normal and that life also belonged to me, was a priest**, the priest who taught me Religion classes at the institute. **To a classmate's question about homosexuality, Manolo, that was the name of the priest, said that homosexuality was part of human diversity and that homosexuals were as children of God as the rest.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Thanks to that priest, much more human and Christian than this ultra-right and ultra-extreme right who names God only to hate**, I had the first positive opinion about what it was to be homosexual. **That priest saved my life. Literally. After that class, which I will thank for life, I began to put myself in front of a mirror, when I was left alone at home, and repeated the word gay without stopping. “I am gay, I am gay, I am gay and I have the right to be happy,**” he told me, as if it were a litany.

&amp;#x200B;

I was 16 when Manolo, the priest of my institute who gave the option of Religion, told me that I had the right to be happy, that life belonged to me and **That nobody had the moral authority to harm me because of my sexual orientation**. **My parents did not change their opinion of homosexuality, but I did and after the years I was able to see my parents as normal, never to confuse sexual orientation with an addiction problem and even to feel proud To have a son like me**.

&amp;#x200B;

**The parental pin is not freedom, but to deny that the children of conservative parents have the right to find in the institute a teacher like Manolo who makes them understand that life also belongs to them**, that nobody deserves to feel dirty because of their sexual orientation and that **There is no moral doctrine or God that is worth more than the happiness of a 16-year-old boy who has thought that taking his life is perhaps the best way to put an end to so much misunderstanding and suffering.**",,/r/europe/comments/eu0647/with_parental_pin_i_would_have_committed_suicide/ffjoouz/,bm52oc,1580003145

&amp;#x200B;

I do not wish anyone that feeling of cold in August or feel with 16 years that you are not worthy of being loved, so these days I stir up every time I hear the word freedom **in the mouth of those who defend a model of society in which I It would have taken my life**. What the parental pin means is to deny LGBT children to find spaces of love and understanding in school or in the institute.

&gt;**22,188 children were born** **.**

Data from October 2018 said 21,666 live births, which means that 452 children were born from frozen embryos in the last 14 months. This is another proof of the incredible success of the program and method.

## 10,000 were to be born. children

In vitro efficacy is estimated at 30/40 percent on average. This means that a maximum of four out of ten women in the program could become mothers.

&gt;**How is it possible that of 19,617 couples who benefited from government funding, more than 22,000 were born?** **children?**

The first births in the three years of the program are mainly fresh transfers, in other words without freezing the embryo. The procedure consists of:

* hormonal stimulation that stimulates the ovaries to produce enough eggs;
* puncture (anesthesia) during which eggs are collected;
* cell fertilization;
* and the embryo transfer itself to the uterus.

Each pair was entitled to a maximum of three complete in vitro fertilization cycles, in which a maximum of six eggs could be fertilized at one time in the first two attempts. The restriction came into [the](http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20150001087) 2015 [Act on Infertility Treatment](http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20150001087) and is still in force today. No other European Union country has restrictive regulations.

""We were afraid of restrictions. We thought that it would significantly affect the effectiveness of the program. Nothing could be more wrong.

To eliminate the risk of multiple pregnancies, one embryo could be administered during transfer. The rest was subject to cryopreservation, i.e. freezing, which in the Polish program has achieved amazing results.

Using the ministry's data, taking into account multiple pregnancies (1.9 thousand) and determining the cumulative pregnancy rate at the level of 50 percent, we assumed that by October 2018, up to 10.8 was born from cryotransfers thousand. children. Today we know that there are even more of them.

&gt;**Most often these are the second or third pregnancies of people who joined the program seven years ago.**

These are global trends today to eliminate the risk of complications associated with multiple pregnancies. Over the years, we've also gained a lot of experience in freezing embryos as well as possible, but also - what's more difficult - eggs, ""says Dr. Kozioł.

From year to year, the number of centers increased, and those without much echo, could calmly deal with increasing the effectiveness of the method.

The Warsaw clinic ""nOvum"", in which Dr. Kozioł works, was established in 1994. Just a year later, the first sperm cell to cell microinjection (ICSI) was performed in Poland. The method has been used around the world for four years (1991).

Conventional in vitro only helped women who could not have children, e.g. due to obstruction of the fallopian tubes. Until 1991, there was no rescue for couples in which the man was infertile. Only microinjection opened the way for biological paternity in men who had very few or no sperm in the sperm (and those were produced in the supranuclear).

The revolutionary ICSI procedure on the first page was described by Gazeta Wyborcza.

Attempts were made to close the measure, but after months of public debate, appeals - including to the Minister of Health - and the fight before the courts managed to maintain activity.

The minister recognized that in vitro procedures are considered infertility treatment, not experiments, the clinic operates in accordance with applicable law, so the prosecutor's office discontinued the investigation. And fortunately, because only thanks to freezing embryos, since then, over 6,000 pregnancies have been conceived in nOvum ""- says OKO.press, Dr. Katarzyna Kozioł.

### Divine in vitro, or my children, is a miracle. Christmas conversation with mother and son conceived ""in glass""

December 24, 2018

After the 1994 storm, infertility treatment centers operated in relative peace. The only thing that bothered the reproductive medicine community was the lack of legal justification. Until 2015, Poland did not introduce EU directives regulating the principles of in vitro fertilization, the creation of reproductive cell banks, embryos and the operation of infertility treatment centers.

Dr. Kozioł believes that the indescribable advantage of the government's in vitro reimbursement program is the creation of an act on infertility treatment, which since June 2015 clearly sanctions treatments and activities of centers. ""Although the political atmosphere is not friendly, it is thanks to the law that we clearly know that we operate in accordance with the law,"" adds the embryologist.

## Sterility? Every fifth couple in Poland is ill

Currently, 1,500 in vitro fertilization treatments are performed at nOvum. Over two are transfers from frozen embryos. The number of procedures in the whole country is not known, because after closing the government program, no one maintains an official register of procedures.

It is known that the problem is common. According to the Polish Gynecological Society, infertility affects 1.5 million pairs a year, and the Polish Society of Reproductive Medicine and Embryology [estimates](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://forsal.pl/artykuly/1412298,epidemia-bezplodnosci-co-6-para-w-polsce-ma-problemy-z-poczeciem-dziecka.html&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271&amp;usg=ALkJrhiM9346651t7UEeHZD3PM9F71kT8g) that it suffers from it

&gt;**""Every sixth, maybe even every fifth couple of childbearing age.""**

The numbers will grow because environmental pollution and ubiquitous chemistry, e.g. plant protection products, food additives, and household chemicals are responsible for fertility problems.

In men, sperm decline in semen is common, and in women the reasons for not being able to become pregnant are: ovulation disorders, obstructed fallopian tubes, endometriosis and premature menopause.

Infertility is also social in nature. Women later decide to have a baby, which naturally translates into fertility and the body's ability to become pregnant naturally.

""In the face of a steady decrease in the birth rate, effective infertility treatment including in vitro treatments

&gt;should be treated as saving the fertility of the whole society. ""

\- assesses Dr. Kozioł.

Already in December 2019, the state bought six private clinics that deal with assisted reproductive methods. From February 1, 2020, couples who have unsuccessfully applied for a child will be able to apply for funding for treatments.

&gt;**""If we want to have Hungarian children, not immigrants, we should support pro-family policy by all means,"" said the Hungarian prime minister justifying the nationalization of clinics and reimbursement in vitro.**

Franklin's reasoning was essentially correct in that America's population continued to double every twenty years until the 1850s when it surpassed England's and continued until the frontier disappeared.[7]

3203,"&gt; The Conservative majority following the December 2019 UK General Election means that negotiations between the UK and EU will from February move from the ‘divorce’ talks to discussing the future economic partnership. The content of this new economic partnership will be of vital importance not just for EU-UK relations, but also for the UK’s and the EU’s own future policies.

&gt; In a special issue of the journal Politics and Governance, a group of scholars has assessed how Brexit – including different possible outcomes for the future economic partnership – might affect EU policies across a range of policies. In this blog post, we build on our own contribution concerning EU trade policy in the light of the new UK government and European Commission, which also assumed office in December of last year.

&gt; The common-sense position amongst many observers has been that that Brexit is likely to make EU trade policy more protectionist, as one of the most commercially liberal member states will leave the EU. We contend that this prediction needs to be qualified for at least three reasons.

&gt; While Brexit will lead to the removal of UK representatives from the EU institutions, it does not necessarily mean that the interests currently represented by the UK will disappear. Economic operators might decide to relocate their activities to the EU. The extent to which this will happen depends not just on the future economic partnership, but also on the degree of ongoing uncertainty.

&gt; A failure to agree on a future economic partnership without an extension to the transition period is likely to be a highly unstable outcome politically given its significant (negative) impacts. Where a cliff edge is avoided despite the UK government sticking to its insistence that it will not seek an extension to the transition period, the Commission’s position is that negotiators ‘will have to prioritise’. Issues, where the EU cannot take unilateral mitigating action, would likely be resolved later. And if the transition period is extended that would also prolong the uncertainty.

&gt; The important point is that one cannot simply ‘subtract’ current UK interests from the EU’s future preference constellation as much depends on how businesses react. Both a looser economic partnership and more uncertainty might mean that more UK-based interests dependent on frictionless trade and cross-border service delivery might relocate to the Union. Counterintuitively, a hard Brexit, following a drawn-out negotiation, might actually lead to fewer changes in the EU’s interest constellation than closer economic alignment following a smoother set of talks.

&gt; Secondly, other public or private actors in the EU that align with the UK on trade policy might adjust their strategies to secure their interests post-Brexit. This has already happened with the creation of the Hanseatic League, a coalition of small, northern European Member States supportive of free trade and budgetary restraint.

&gt; Finally, the future course of EU trade policy also depends on how Brexit is framed. If the referendum result is interpreted as a call for protection by the losers of globalisation, a less liberal response is likely. But if Brexit is framed as a retrograde, protectionist move, then it could serve to legitimate (more) open, and potentially deregulatory, trade policies.

&gt; In the three and a half years since the referendum, the EU has generally reinforced its liberal trade policy orientation. Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as US President were seized on by the European Commission to present the Union as the ‘leader in trade’ that the world needs. In this period, under the leadership of Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, a plethora of ongoing trade negotiations have been concluded with the likes of Canada, Japan and Mercosur (the regional economic bloc involving Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay). New talks were also launched with Australia and New Zealand, amongst others. However, as the Brexit process moves to its next stage, and with a new European Commission in office under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen, there exists an opportunity to reframe the EU’s trade policies.

&gt; The day after the UK General Election, von der Leyen stated that the EU’s goal in the upcoming negotiations was to achieve ‘zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping’. This new slogan underlines the importance accorded by the EU to preserve a ‘level playing field’ between the EU and the UK. The aim is to avoid UK-based firms undercutting EU firms as a result of less stringent competition and state aid rules, lower taxes and laxer social and environmental protection.

&gt; Such provisions – providing for, amongst other things, non-regression on labour standards and environmental rules, dynamic alignment on state aid rules and the transposition of EU tax directives – were already included in the initial draft of the Withdrawal Agreement which featured a ‘backstop’ customs union between the EU and the UK. They may have since been dropped in the renegotiated Withdrawal Agreement – which no longer features such an agreement on a customs union – but remain relevant for the next phase. Top EU politicians and officials have since repeatedly warned the UK that it should not follow up on the threat, or ambition, to turn itself into a ‘Singapore-on-Thames’ if it wants to maintain easy access to the Single Market.

&gt; Beyond Brexit and the UK, this strengthened emphasis on a level playing field in exchange for extensive market access could become a more extensive feature of the EU’s future trade policy with third parties. While the UK is both more proximate and significant than other trade partners, there is an argument to be made that the EU could be more consistent: it is harder for the EU to justify withholding market access to the UK if it pursues a ‘Singapore-on-Thames’ strategy when it just concluded a trade agreement with Singapore that did not feature as stringent provisions.

&gt; We would argue that the context is potentially also fortuitous in terms of upgrading the EU’s relatively weaker commitments on ensuring a ‘level playing field’ on social and environmental standards. Recent provisions in free trade agreements have only gone as far on non-regression (e.g. in CETA) and are not enforceable through sanctions.

&gt; Reciprocity has been a long-standing motif within EU trade policymaking, informing previous moves to establish an International Procurement Instrument and the EU’s 2010 ‘Trade, Growth and World Affairs’ strategy. But current policies are pulling reciprocity in a stronger and markedly more environmental direction. The new Commission’s ambitions in respect of climate and environmental policy, as outlined in the ‘European Green Deal’, have led it to propose a ‘carbon border mechanism’ that seeks to prevent ‘carbon leakage’ – or the offshoring of emissions.

&gt; While many EU policymakers may hope that ‘Brexit’ will become a less prominent feature of 2020, its effects on the EU still loom large. As the process moves to the next stage of negotiations on the future economic partnership, the impact of Brexit on EU-UK relations and on the UK’s and EU’s future policies remains uncertain. In EU trade policy, we have so far not seen a protectionist turn as has been expected by several observers. However, if the negotiations with the UK raise the profile of ‘level playing field’ provisions on the environment and labour standards this could change EU trade policy in the longer term.

Workers in developed countries should not be put in competition with foreign slave labor.  China was admitted to the WTO which was a big problem, but screw the little people, right?

&gt;Regarding the Banks, discussable, bailing out banks certainly is also in the interest of litle people.

Socialism for the rich, let the poor pay for it.  Discussable?  You don't know what happened, do you?  4.5 trillion dollars, gone.  

&gt;And nowadays who cares that you have to compete against Chinese workers?

Workers certainly do.  It's apparent you don't care.  

&gt;Also contradiction to your comment about China.

YOU are advocating the China-style government of the most able.  I'm pointing out that they have your exact system and yet they're a nightmare.  

I think I'm done arguing with a pro-tyranny advocate.  

&gt;... The fanatical adherents of a social theory are capable of taking any measures, no matter how extreme, for carrying out their views: holding, like the merciless priesthoods of past times, that the end justifies the means. And when a general socialistic organisation has been established, the vast, ramified, and consolidated body of those who direct its activities, using without check whatever coercion seems to them needful in the interests of the system (which will practically become their own interests) will have no hesitation in imposing their rigorous rule over the entire lives of the actual workers; until, eventually, there is developed an official oligarchy, with its various grades, exercising a tyranny more gigantic and more terrible than any which the world has seen.

Neither do you, because its intention to introduce preventive censorship is explicitly outlined in its wording. A big no-no.

&gt;For the censorship, you should revise it. That would allow to prevent the homophobic and nazi from showing up.

If something illegal is published, then whoever published it will be prosecuted for it. It's just that nobody should control things to be published *before* they are published, because this is a totalitarian measure that is way too easy to be abused.

&gt;For your constitution, I guess you will either have to change it

Imagine being the politician responsible for deleting the following passage from the constitution:

""Article 54

1. The freedom to express opinions, to acquire and to disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone.

*2. Preventive censorship of the means of social communication and the licensing of the press shall be prohibited.*""

3416,"&gt; That's refined uranium. It requires ever larger volumes of ore to get to that.

its still cheaper then power from coal and all data shows that nuclear still needs less natural resources then renewables, which you need to replace every 20 years.

&gt;That's theory. In theory, you could split every kind of atom, but we just don't know of a practial way to do so. Reprocessing nuclear waste just means that you sift through it (in energetically expensive ways) for stuff that didn't get processed the first time around. You still are confronted with a growing waste heap, and you still require a nonstop source of new fuel.

&gt;I like science fiction too, but I don't base energy policy on it. Nuclear fusion is pie in the sky so far. Call me when it has descended from the space of platonic ideas into reality and we can smell it.

Dont mistake it for pure nuclear fusion, hybrid fusion-fission power is quite a bit different and is much more viable and realistic I actually had chance to talk with someone who actually know quite a bit about this and he said that we could build it much sooner then pure nuclear fusion, since it doesnt have same problems,  working on hybird fusion-fission power would actually help in research and developement of pure fusion power.
and Yes it can use nuclear waste as fuel.

&gt;I see more, more significant, and faster improvements in renewables.

Oh really ?  it taken 35 years from reaching 20% efficency in labs to commercialization of 20% efficent solar panels, on other hand 30 years after end of first generation of reactors we reached third generation, I would say its quite comperable.

&gt;That actually goes for all electronics. Limiting all electronics would work too to reduce emissions, sure.

Of course I know that.

&gt;So they implicitly admit they are dependent on government support.

yeah I do, of course same is for renewables and other types of sources of energy but you will ignore that...

.hey are, for example in Spain the policy on renewables has been shifting drastically, so they have relatively few, despite having excellent opportunities for both wind and solar. The place of renewables on the net still varies widely between countries, often being stifled where nuclear plant owners have the ear of the government. But where they can compete freely they often undercut nuclear.

But where they can compete freely they often undercut nuclear.

So you are agree that its a big problem for any source of power, whatever its nuclear or renewables when regulations constantly change.

&gt;That's just one variable, advances in other ways, for example by using more common elements, or easier production processes help just as well. In addition, we get the mass production bonuses in price reduction which cannot be attained for nuclear power. Nuclear plants cannot be produced with a 2% defective rate in exchange for producing 20% more - every nuclear plant needs to work, and be fixed until it works.

Well yeah, I would say its **main** reason why commercial renewables lag so far behind what we got in labs, I expect that making higher efficiency renewables then what we got isnt that hard, problem is that they would be too expensive to be viable, may have shorter lifespan and also can be more toxic.",,/r/europe/comments/esaulq/nuclear_excluded_from_eus_new_just_transition_fund/ffi8de5/,Culaio,1579967732

First off, who mentioned anything about bragging?  You're already skewing the conversation.  I'm not bragging, I just identified with my heritage.  And I simply pointed out that immigrants everywhere do this, including in Europe.  This isn't unique to the U.S.  But for some reason, this sub has a hate boner for Americans and likes to joke about it while failing to mention their own hyphenated citizens.  It's hypocrisy, plain and simple.  As to assimilation, there are varying degrees.  If a Norwegian immigrated to Sweden, within less than a generation or sooner hardly anyone would be able to tell the difference and wouldn't care if they did.  If a Japanese person (or insert whatever not-native European ethnicity you like) immigrates to Sweden, they will forever be Japanese-Swedish and most likely their descendants too.  The reverse would also be true.  The hypothetical Swede in Japan would never be considered Japanese by the Japanese even if they had citizenship, spoke the language, married a local, etc.  Appearances matter whether we like it or not.  Consequently, people tend to identify with others like themselves and one way to do that after immigrating is by holding onto an ethnic identity.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/et7u84/luxemburg_is_not_a_microstate_size_compared_to/ffi9wsd/,J_de_C,1579968818

&gt;That it turns out horrid outcomes? And a democratic system despite all its flaws would be better? Huh, weird

The Nazis were democratic elected.

&gt;It's racist as fuck.
... Okay if you say so. Even if. Doesn't mean it can't happen. Looking a the US and Uk makes it even more likely.

&gt;They bailed out the banks in the 2008 crisis and forced the working class to pay for it. They made trade agreements that put the working class in competition with slave labor. They allowed illegal immigration that harmed the working class. They allowed skilled legal immigration that harmed the working class. All to keep costs down and margins high, and make more money for people who are already wealthy.

Ah is see. You just are an egoistic person. So much for the better of people. This comment shows you don't care. You don't care about others. Just your own little self in your own little nation. 

Regarding those Trade agreements: Nobody forces people to buy certain stuff. ever thought of that?

Regarding the Banks, discussable, bailing out banks certainly is also in the interest of litle people. 

Regarding the Harm of the working class.: 

I was in highest Managment positions, as well as in lowest skilled jobs and the most in both i was pissed of of lazzy shit ass colleagues. If you just invest a little effort everyone can get better. But apparently it was always enough to work like this. And nowadays who cares that you have to compete against Chinese workers?

Just don't make trade Agreements? We get our steal form the moon Right? The Oil from who? Saudi Arabia, Russia? Oil= Plastics, grease, Chemicals btw.

&gt;It's been tried.

Were? And don't come with China again. As there is Partyline as you yourself said more important than free think or intellectual capability. 

And even if. Laugable shit like the US or Uk won't be able to compete against China in the Future. Not amount of redneckishness will cahnge that.

3480,"I honestly don't know, I'm working on my thought process and knowledge at the moment.
I used to read ancient philosophers and now I am in a mix of anarchist and hobbesian reflexion so my mind is not fixed yet.

An argument in favor of legalization makes sense to me: as an individual the state should not reduce your liberty unless you are a threat to the common good. State should not be paternalistic. 
If you use hard drugs on your own private space, why not? I don't see a moral reason to forbid the use of hard drugs in private space. (based on the process) 

However I see why allowing drugs could create health problems: more availability means more consumption, which leads to more health and social problems... And this is a moral argument in favor of forbidding the use of drugs (based on the outcome)

Again, I am not sure of my position but I see why we would want or don't want the drugs legalized. To go further we should look into research and concrete data. 
If we legalize drugs it means you can tax the product, regulate its consumption (if stores are owned by the state, the principal objective will not be profit but public health, which means a better product quality, a limitation of quantity bought in one time, and a follow up of addict people as well as treatment center for addicts). With the taxation, you can finance structures to treat the problem of addiction. 
Moreover by legalizing the drug, you open the discussion regarding its use with the people who use it and you can give them more information about the effects of the drugs, and the way to leave dependency. You don't have to just say ""it's forbidden"" anymore. (although I saw some northern European states who launched campaign of information regarding the use of hard drugs while these drugs still being forbidden).
Finally, by offering a safer product, you diminish the social cost that the people are already paying for (in my country healthcare is free). When someone is sick because of a bad drug, he goes to the hospital and is treated as a patient. 

But again, these are just suppositions: maybe the taxation will not help finance the good structures. Maybe the use of the drugs will sky rocket. I honestly don't know. I never used drugs, and don't plan to. I have never been confronted to someone using it or going through addiction. Maybe I'm being naive here. 

So legalization or not? I don't know. One thing I know for sure is we need to shift the view of the use of the drug from a criminal one to a health problem one in order to treat the tragic problem of addiction and better the lives of the people. 

That's it for me. What do you think? Does it makes sense to you? I will be more than happy to read your answer!",,/r/europe/comments/etrhjg/portugals_drug_decriminalization_then_now/ffiakqd/,yztt25562,1579969280

3683,"

EVER SINCE the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party took power in 2015, Adam Bodnar, Poland’s human-rights ombudsman, has been warning against its relentless efforts to get control of the courts. To illustrate the danger, he uses an expression from communist times: lex telefonica. In the Polish People’s Republic, verdicts were routinely dictated by a phone call from an apparatchik at party headquarters. Today’s government has more subtle techniques, but the goal is the same, Mr Bodnar says: “If a judge has a case on his desk with some political importance, he should be afraid.”

The European Commission is worried, too. It accuses PiS of violating Poland’s commitments to the rule of law under the European Union’s founding treaty. In 2017 the commission took Poland to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) over laws that gave politicians control over appointing judges. (For example, they lowered judges’ retirement age while letting the justice minister pick whom to exempt.) The ECJ ruled against the Poles, who had in the meantime scrapped some of the measures.

Now another ruling by the ECJ threatens to force Poland into an open break with the EU. Last year PiS passed a law creating a disciplinary chamber for the country’s Supreme Court, which has stubbornly resisted government control. The chamber could suspend judges, and its members would be appointed by Poland’s president—a former member of PiS—along with the National Judiciary Council, the official jurists’ association. (This is now controlled by parliament, where PiS has a majority.) The Supreme Court queried the law in the ECJ, which laid out criteria for whether the system violated judicial independence. On December 5th the Supreme Court, applying those criteria, ruled that it does.

The government threw a fit. On December 20th it pushed a law through parliament’s lower house that directs the disciplinary chamber to punish judges who apply the ECJ’s ruling. On January 11th Iustitia, an independent jurists’ association, led a protest march in Warsaw of hundreds of toga-wearing judges from Poland and abroad, including Malgorzata Gersdorf, the Supreme Court’s president. The group calls the new law “unheard of and unimaginable in the circle of civilised states”.

The government says it is being treated unfairly. Under EU treaties, says Andrzej Duda, the president, “Poland has the right to regulate its internal legal order.” The opposite is closer to the truth. The treaties oblige national courts to apply EU law and obey the ECJ. European officials and experts in EU law warn that if one country’s courts are politicised, others may stop accepting their rulings.

That would threaten the legal sinews that hold the union together. Poland is not the only country facing concerns over the rule of law. PiS copied many ideas from Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party. Rule-of-law concerns have been raised in Bulgaria, Malta, Romania and elsewhere. While Poles worry about judicial independence, the EU worries about a threat to its architecture.

In a white paper in 2018, the government offered three justifications for its reforms. One was that the courts had never been properly de-communised. Three decades after the transition, this seems dubious. The average judge is far too young to have served under the communist regime. The government undermined its own case in November by appointing to the constitutional court an elderly PiS lawmaker who had served as a notorious prosecutor for the old dictatorship.

Another argument is that cases take too long. The government cites a survey in 2017 showing Poland ranked 24th of 35 developed countries for public satisfaction with the judiciary. Backlogs are indeed long, but judges say the reforms will not shorten them. They have not added support staff or simplified procedures much.

A third claim is that the EU is biased against eastern European countries, since western ones also give governments some say in the judiciary. For example, in Germany, as in Poland, the president of the constitutional tribunal is picked by the government, and cases are heard by smaller panels of judges. But in Poland the court’s president gets to select the panels, and can choose loyal PiS justices.

This pattern of taking bits of other democracies and combining them into something authoritarian was pioneered in Hungary. (Kim Lane Scheppele, a political scientist, terms it the “Frankenstate” approach.) Such complex manoeuvres may fool lay people, but not the experts. “If you have some knowledge of the systems in Europe it’s quite obvious what is going on,” says Kees Sterk, president of the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary. His group suspended Poland’s National Judicial Council in 2018.

“Judges are starting to get disciplinary pressures because of our rulings,” says Tomasz Trebicki, who serves on a Warsaw city court. Those who cross the government are hassled over bureaucratic mistakes or reassigned to different courts. After the ECJ ruled last summer that Poland’s system was politically tainted, several judges asked it whether this meant that colleagues appointed under the new rules were illegitimate under European law. They all faced disciplinary procedures. The government’s new bill would bar such queries.

That bill will probably be rejected by the Senate, where PiS lacks a majority since last autumn’s elections. But it can only send the bill back to the lower house for amendment, not block it. A report by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, a legal watchdog, denounces the bill as a blatant violation of judicial independence. (Poland’s justice minister called the report a “parody”.) Meanwhile, the European Commission is taking more drastic steps. On January 14th it asked the ECJ to order Poland to suspend the Supreme Court’s disciplinary chamber, effective immediately.

Ms Gersdorf, the independent-minded Supreme Court president, must retire in April, and PiS will appoint her successor. Last month the court issued a warning that defying the ECJ could eventually force the country out of the EU. “You can’t be a member of the European Union if you don’t have independent, impartial courts,” Koen Lenaerts, the ECJ’s chief justice, agreed on a visit to Warsaw. Most analysts see a less apocalyptic scenario where Polish courts are ignored by other EU countries, sowing chaos in everything from business disputes to cross-border divorces. For Poland, that would be bad. For the EU, a union made of laws, it would be grave. ■",,/r/europe/comments/etq170/europe_confronts_poland_over_its_trampling_on_the/ffhu7o7/,funzen26,1579954121

First of all, you have to understand that legal age for consensual sex is 18, so if some guy 19 has consensual sex with a 17 year old girl, it is still counted as rape. Also in southeastern regions (majority Kurdish) child brides (under 18) is very common, if one of the parties are under 18, even if they both agree, this still counts as rape. The aim of the bill is to eliminate people being persecuted even when both parties consent, especially if they already agreed to marry beforehand. 

**THIS BILL DOES NOT FORCE WOMEN TO MARRY.** 

However, even if the aim is to eliminate unjust persecutions, I totally agree that this bill might cause unwanted effects, especially given that women don't have much power of saying no, so if there was a real rape and the families somehow made a deal, the girls might be forced to marry their real rapists just because the family got paid or something.

On the other hand: it's a bit easy to dismiss the current proposal as pure crap. If minimum wages in poorer countries go up, it's beneficial for us Western countries too. 

Let's be honest here: there's no way a Swedish worker can compete with a Bulgarian one in terms of cost-effectiveness provided that they work in a similar setting and make a similar product. By gradually pulling up the Bulgarian salaries, you are preventing unfair competition and you avoid people falling into poverty.

Ekke Overdiep 22 januari

Warsaw – He didn’t say it literally, but he did say it: Poland needs to defend itself against the EU just as previous generations had to defend themselves against Nazism and Communism. “We Poles have the right to our own, independent, sovereign, and democratic state”, proclaimed Jaroslaw Kaczyński at a mass in honor of his mother, who was a resistance member in the war. “This connects our times to an episode from the life of a generation that is almost entirely gone now. And with everything we do now to repel this new attack on our democracy and independence.”

“This attack” comes from the EU. The European Court set limits to Kaczyński's Law and Justice (PIS) subjugation of the judiciary. The European Parliament condemned the authoritarian trends of the Hungarians and Poles and called on the European Council to take stronger action.
Kaczyński doesn't care. A new ""muzzle law"" punishes every judge who complies with the ruling of the European Court. Unique. Never before has a Member State attempted to block a judgment of the highest EU court. The Council of Europe's legal advisory body also made a joke of Kaczyński’s ""reforms"" last week: the ""muzzle law"" is a further curtailment of the independence of judges.

The court may impose a fine at any time for each day that Warsaw refuses to execute its judgment. Something will have to give. Execution of the judgment means that PiS does not get to control the Supreme Court (i.e. the judiciary). Plans are being made in Brussels to make the payment of EU subsidies conditional on respect for the rule of law. Poland is the largest recipient of European money. Minister Ziobro immediately threatened with the veto weapon: ""Without Poland's approval, there will be no EU budget at all.""

The P word: Polexit is used more and more often in analyses. The powerbrokers in Warsaw avoid it completely, because a large majority of the Polish population is positive about EU membership. But the question is increasingly: which EU does Poland want to be a member of? During the debate in the European Parliament last week, a British parliamentarian advised the Poles: get out anyway. He got a standing ovation from the besieged PiS delegation.",Groningen (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/etngfk/polexit_is_no_longer_taboo_article_dutch/ffhh3uq/,wildleanloan,1579934976

3960,"Text:

When Emmanuel Macron was elected just over two and a half years ago, his ambitions stretched a long way. He described the presidential role as being like Jupiter, and believed that the momentum that took him to the Elysée would excite forces far beyond France’s borders. He hoped to deliver a ‘European renaissance’ that would overhaul the continent’s political structures. Only last year, he addressed a letter to the ‘citizens of Europe’ describing his vision of renewal.

But he might have noticed by now that even in France his hold seems rather tenuous. And at present, the country is not a great advert for Macronism. In recent weeks we’ve had transportation paralysed, hundreds of cars burning in the suburbs, violent demonstrations in the cities, whiffs of tear gas in the Métro and police beating protesters. Train drivers, air traffic controllers, nurses, opera singers and ballet dancers have gone on strike. Even the lawyers have joined in. If the country is not wholly immobilised, that’s because the French are pretty adaptable and, to be honest, some only pretend to strike. My garbage was picked up as usual.

Macron promised to unblock the French economy, but although unemployment is down a bit, it is still at 8.5 per cent, more than double that of Germany or the UK. In spite of his overtures to the Davos set, whom he invited for a blingy reception at the Palace of Versailles, France continues to export capital and brains. Macron talks of civility, but there have been 61 consecutive weekends of street protests, many of them characterised by extraordinary levels of violence, including by the police. He may have control over the National Assembly, but his efforts to gain ground in municipal elections in March seem shaky, especially in the south. His party, En Marche, is more of a personality cult than a political movement and it doesn’t have much ground game. His mission to unseat the socialist mayor of Paris looks doomed. Only the most hardcore of his fans remain unshaken by this remarkably dismal performance.

Until recently, Macron was able to cheer himself up with his international profile. For bien-pensants everywhere, he has been a hero, an anti-Trump: brainy not impulsive; centrist not populist; cultured not vulgar; a product of meritocracy, not of inheritance or privilege. One magazine ran a cover that depicted him walking on water. EU enthusiasts cheered on his willingness to do a no-deal Brexit, the better to show Brits that there can be no comfortable life outside the European Union. But in recent months, even Macron’s foreign fans have seemed to be giving up on him.

Macron has tried no end of personal diplomatic initiatives. None has been successful. Indeed his talent for losing friends and alienating people seems to know no limit. Lately, he has been cosying up to Putin, suggesting that Russia should be an ally rather than an adversary, which has infuriated his existing allies. When he denounced Nato as ‘brain-dead’, he ended up being attacked by Donald Trump and admonished by Angela Merkel, who was quoted as saying that she understood Macron’s ‘desire for disruptive politics’ but was ‘tired of picking up the pieces’. After boasting that he could manage Trump, Macron went to Capitol Hill to scorn the President’s climate policy. It’s unclear what this has achieved. He has had to suspend his tax on America’s digital giants because Trump was threatening a 100 per cent tariff on French wine and cheese. ‘We will work together on a good agreement to avoid tariff escalation,’ tweeted Macron. ‘Excellent!’ replied Trump, clearly the victor.

There is another world leader, however, who could yet rescue Macron’s presidency. Intriguingly, incredibly, the French leader’s new best friend is Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Macron has suddenly stopped dis-respecting les rosbifs, something he did publicly at every opportunity, often several times a week, as he travelled around France calling Brexit insane and nationalist and propelled by liars. Yet now he appears to have fallen under BoJo’s spell.

What’s changed? Well, for a start, Macron likes power — and Johnson has plenty of it. With a majority of 80 and a five-year mandate, the Prime Minister is now one of the most stable leaders in Europe — a point not lost on the Americans and others seeking solid allies.

The career paths of Macron and Johnson could hardly have been more different. Both are products of their nation’s elite education system (Oxford for Johnson, École nationale d’administration for Macron) but Johnson went on to be a brilliant, incendiary journalist, whereas Macron became a clever but anonymous technocrat.

Boris entered politics with high ambitions but a sense of fun. Macron stayed in the shadows, emerging seemingly from nowhere to seize the presidency from his gormless boss, François Hollande. Boris improvises. Macron plans everything. Boris likes women and is with someone 24 years his junior. Macron married his high-school drama teacher, 24 years his senior.

Yet there is something going on between these two. The body language says they like each other. The video from the Nato summit reception at Buckingham Palace in December, at which Macron and Boris were literally shoulder-to-shoulder as they revelled in Justin Trudeau’s mockery of Trump, was telling. In Paris last summer, Boris was denounced for sticking his feet on the designer furniture in the Elysée — but Macron was photographed actually laughing.

What might these two enfants terribles get up to? An especially curious geometry presents itself in a post-Brexit era, when little will be more important to the British than preserving civility with the French. Brexit talks are about to start again, and it would suit the Prime Minister to have a president who knows which side his baguette is buttered. The absence of a trade deal could tip both the UK and the eurozone into recession.

And there’s much scope for these two leaders to work together. Macron needs help in his overextended foreign policy. France’s grinding conflict against militant Islamism in Africa looks bloody and inconclusive, as instability spreads in an expanding area of operations. Thirteen French troops died in a single incident in Mali a few weeks ago. Faced with further setbacks, Macron summoned African leaders to Paris last week, where he threatened to withdraw, but ended up committing 200 more troops.

In this fight, Britain is the only capable military ally France can call on. The Germans are useless. Theresa May promised France RAF logistic support — but failed to demand a quid pro quo on the Brexit front. Boris might well offer more substantial assistance, but in return he’d want to see Anglo-French co-operation expressing itself in trade talks.

France also has gigantic stakes in British energy, transport and services. The City remains the dominant financial player in the EU, offering services vital to EU governments and businesses. And the Islamist security threat is common on both sides of the channel.

So there are numerous reasons why, after trashing the UK for more than two years, Paris has softened its tone. The latest olive branch is Macron’s proposal to award London the Légion d’honneur for its resistance during the second world war. If Johnson can maintain this budding friendship, and he and Macron manage to build a new entente cordiale, it could become a cornerstone of European relations for years to come, benefiting them both.

Macron also has ambitions to save the nuclear deal with Iran, bringing the ayatollahs in from the cold by reviving the agreement Trump has torn up. Earlier this month, his plan seemed to have been shot down, literally in flames, with America’s assassination of Qassem Soleimani. But listen carefully and you can hear some British support for the French position: in his first interview of the year, the Prime Minister said it was time for a ‘Trump deal’ — in other words, one that allowed the White House to take the credit.

For all his troubles, Macron faces no serious leftist or centrist challenger. It is still pretty much a choice between him or Marine Le Pen and her nativist, economically incoherent Rassemblement National party. At the Elysée he’s digging in for the long haul. Insiders say he’s made the place his own, more or less abandoning the ceremonial presidential office for a new hyper-modern command centre dominated by an enormous concrete desk by the star designer Francesco Passaniti, installed recently to much sweating and groaning by the déménageurs. Le Figaro magazine ran a picture of him sitting at it, his fawning wife Brigitte at his shoulder. A source close to the president told the magazine: ‘What’s fascinating is that reality matters less to him than the story he can make of it.’ Eat your heart out, Donald Trump.

It is Macron’s luck that French voters who never warmed to him, and who on the whole like him less than ever, may still find him the lesser evil. And having Boris as his friend may humanise him in the eyes of French voters, who seem to rather admire the roguish new Prime Minister, so terriblement British. Perhaps Boris can teach Macron how to lighten up, make a pithy speech, perhaps even tell a joke. Macron still seems likely to preside over the Paris Olympics in 2024. London 2012 was a triumph for Johnson; he could offer the French President a few tips. How does this bromance end?

4080,"Yugoslavia definitely had some upsides and did a lot of things right particularly in the late '60s and in the '70s, but sometimes people look back at the ""good old days"" in pink shades. The truth is that in hindsight, the foundations of that country were not as strong or as fair as the regime pretended they were, and the power dynamics (politically, socially, economically) developed over time in such a way that made the constituent peoples eventually drift apart from each other, and especially from Belgrade. I think that by the mid-'80s, the eventual downfall and break-up of Yugoslavia was inevitable. In fact, the wars of the '90s can be seen as an attempt to forcefully keep together as much of the old country as possible even though many of its formerly constituent peoples were not quite on board with that. But then again, that is also not a wholistic representation of the full picture, given that, for example, many parts of it - most notably Bosnia and Herzegovina - were a demographic mosaic.

In a sense, I agree with you about the ""stupid problems"", because I find nationalism overall stupid in the modern era. On the other hand, there were structural and systematic problems that commoners (especially those who lived in areas with wealth below the average and to whom Yugoslavia had brought more tangible benefits because of historic poverty) may have been blissfully unaware of or not concerned by. For example, the idea that one would be better off had Yugoslavia survived to this day and age would be tougher to sell to the average Slovene than to the average Serb. However, that topic is... a very long and interesting discussion at best, and a can of worms at worst.

4234,"&gt;millenial culture of private land ownership in this part of Europe 

Millennial culture of private land ownership? What the hell are you talking about?

All land and the people living on it belonged to the nobles. Except for [small areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloboda) on the border (some of which were in modern Ukraine), those areas moved as the borders of Russian Empire expanded. No such concept remained in the territory of the modern Ukraine after 1775.

In case of the later, those usually belonged to a community or small village that worked the land, not a single owner.

In 1861 servitude in Russian Empire is abolished, the government force [Obshchina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obshchina) (the cooperative or community of farmers) to buy out the lands from the nobles for a mortgage. After that 60-90% of the lands depending on the region belonged to the community of farmers.

Private ownership of land by peasants appear for the first time in 1905 during [Stolypin reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolypin_reform).

With Russian revolution of 1917, the private ownership of land ended. Obviously individual farmers could rent the land, but the thing is if you farm using 14th century methods you cannot get enough harvest to even pay what the land is worth.

 Ukraine’s major grains crops are wheat, corn, barley, and rye.  Ukraine is the fourth largest exporter of corn and barley, and the sixth largest exporter of wheat.  According to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations statistics, by 2020, Ukraine’s cereals and soybean output is estimated to reach 70 million tons and reach 78 million tons by 2024.  With significant improvements in yields, many experts estimate that Ukraine’s total grain output potential is 140 million tons.

4311,"&gt;You obviously have no idea what a democracy or a republic are since those things aren't exclusive. Most democracies are republics, but the UK is not.

In a democracy the public takes in active part in the legislative process. See Athenian democracy as an example. In a republic people get the 'right' to 'elect' someone to do everything for them, in practice the public is giving away all their rights and privileges to a select elite who don't actually have to be held accountable for what they do. In essence, a republic is a nominally elective oligarchy. We have one in the UK: the institution known as Parliament holds all the political power in the UK, the public doesn't have the right to do anything regarding legislation and ruling the country. Our head of state is a monarch, but all the power is vested within parliament and Her Majesty doesn't really have any power in practice, hence why we're functionally a republic.

&gt;None of this has anything to do with your problems with the justice system in the first place.

Justice comes from the people, not a select cadre of rich and wealthy individuals who don't represent the values and interests of the general public.

4378,"Can't really speak for what the nuclear movement was doing during the 80's and 90's, as I was born in 1993. But again, you seem to be labouring under the assumption that renewables can fully replace fossil fuels, which clearly isn't the case: Germany has been spending 30 billion euros a year on renewable subsidies since late 2010 (Energiewende), and they're still one of the dirtiest country in Europe at energy generation. They also have some of the highest expensive energy costs in Europe, which is also why they still haven't replaced coal. (Coal is cheap, getting rid of it now would mean even higher electricity prices, which the public wouldn't support. Realpolitik is a bitch.)  [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity\_price\_statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_price_statistics)

Here's the definition of baseload power: [https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Baseload\_power](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Baseload_power)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base\_load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load)

What part did I get wrong? If you look at [electricitymap.org](https://electricitymap.org) (Linked it in last post) and click on a country that uses nuclear, you'll find that the output remains constant across a 24 hour period. That's baseload: It doesn't care about the wind not blowing or the sun not shining, and thus doesn't depend on backup from other energy sources whenever those things happen. Nuclear pretty much only shuts down for replacement of fuel rods or maintainence during the summer, when electricity demand is lower.

&amp;#x200B;

Intermittent (Weather dependent) sources like wind and solar do depend on the weather, and thus need backup power. I find it kind of disingenious when people say renewables are cheap, without taking into account the cost of providing this backup. (The cost is paid either in C02 emissions, as when you use coal and gas to back them up, or price: Battery storage is expensive.) Sure, a wind power plant might be cheap (Again, due to massive subsidies), but you have to look at the whole energy system. If the energy system requires other power sources to complete it (Which is very much the case), then the price and/or C02 emissions of that backup should be counted.

Again, nuclear doesn't need backup, so this whole argument about nuclear being inflexible is redundant. You could (theoretically) go 100% nuclear. In the case of Sweden, we have nuclear for baseload and use hydro for more flexible load following, and maybe 10-20% wind. Check electricitymap, Sweden should come back online in a few days.

Nuclear power has high capital costs to set up, but the fuel and operations are really cheap. After maybe 15 years of operation it recoups the capital costs, and continues to produce cheap, clean power. (12 c02eq/kWh, according to IPCC 2014. Wind is at 11, but unlike wind power, nuclear doesn't rely on dirty coal/gas whenever the wind stops blowing. See Germany.)

&gt; In April 2017, in a chilling echo of the early 1990s, a mob of ethnic Hungarians descended on the Roma neighbourhood in Gheorgheni, after local media identified two Romani children as the culprits in a theft. ... Romani families were dragged from their homes in five locations, and then beaten by the mob before their houses were set alight. 

&gt; Ukrainian neo-fascist paramilitaries such as C14, who boast of their cooperation with local authorities, posted videos on social media of their ‘cleansing operations’: armed attacks on Roma encampments, where the gangs destroyed and set fire to shacks, and set about beating and forcing Roma families to flee into the forests. In June 2018, one such midnight attack near Kviv claimed the life of a 24-year-old Rom stabbed to death by masked assailants, and left four others wounded, including a 10-year-old boy. As in the past, official collusion and inaction has created a climate of impunity.

&gt; April 2019 witnessed violent attacks on Roma homes and property in the Bulgarian town of Gabrovo by gangs of young men, following ‘spontaneous’ protests.

4584,"\&gt;  You seem to be assuming that the absence of a monarchy or the fact that voting happens equals democracy, but that just isn't the case.

If a country implements and follows the ideals of democracy, then I classify it as a democracy, regardless of whether or not it achieves utopia. Your argument is circular because you only accept democracies that are perfect as democracies, while the failed democracies you don't accept as democracies. Obviously that will mean that democracy equals success, it becomes a meaningless tautology.

Well I guess I will now say that a country is only a true monarchy if it is the best country there has ever been. There, I have now proven that monarchy is superior, because only the best country there ever has been will be a true monarchy. QED!

Yes, but arbitrary taxes on revenue can be structured so they target specific countries without specifically calling them a tariff. For example the largest cheese manufacturers are European.

Also, within the next week, deciding the new trade relationship between the UK and the EU suddenly becomes something that requires unanimous support from all EU countries, rather than something functionally decided unanimously, but potentially only subject to a minority. From now on, any small EU nation that wants leverage for something else will be able to put economic pressure on the netherlands and france by vetoing the deal, with the most politically contentious stuff covered by the backstop, giving them more cover to do it.

It is then up to the players to execute those plays and also have quick thinking (especially the quarterback) to modify them if they see the other team shift or if the plan for the play falls apart. A good coach can position players and run plays in such a fashion that even teams with less outright athleticism can beat more powerful teams, and good teams can sometimes dig out of bad playcalling.

Some believe brexit will give them more money, others believe brexit will give the government more control over immigration and yet others believe that it'll align them more with other Anglosphere nations like the US and Australia. 

Also, since the government is chosen through FPTP it represents only 40% of the electorate and therefore is a minority government by default as we understand it. This means that whatever deal is struck will be fundamentally useless in 5 or 10 years when the other parties decide to try to renegotiate for their minority government etc. See: the JCPOA deal torpedoed by Trump.

The Baltic countries were internationally recognized independent countries with valid border/peace treaties with Soviet Russia. Soviet Union invaded them in 1940 and illegally annexed them. This was not recognized by Western countries, see that from a [US map from 1989](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Soviet_Union_Administrative_Divisions_1989.jpg/1200px-Soviet_Union_Administrative_Divisions_1989.jpg) (the top-left text).

When Soviet Union collapsed, the Baltic countries *restored* these countries, including expelling Soviet army (Ukraine just took a slice of what it hosted, also allowed Sevastopol base to remain), Estonia and Latvia restored former citizenship policy aka Soviet-era immigrants were left without local citizenship, former embassies were returned etc. Ukraine, however, is a country that was clearly based on Ukrainian SSR.

Our king also coordinates the transition (ceremonial ish) between governments after elections. (Think it’s just like in the UK).

We still got a lot of bills passed, and we call them “royal decisions”. The King still signs off on these as far I know. But he signs it all, because the government can easily get around these things. Our previous king openly said he didn’t want to sign the abortion law/bill. So the government sent him a day “on vacation”. Then they can pass it anyway. King knew that was gonna happen, so it was rather meant as “ a statement”.

So yeah, it’s just such things. Not sure if this is still current, but for changing your name/surname you had to actually address the king to ask for changing it. But again, don’t expect actually him objecting. It’s rather a formality.

A risk factor that is biologically not required to even become a factor. Therefore it should be banned for people we consider not mature enough to consent to risks.

I had a severely deformed nasal septum that made me unable to breathe through 1 of my 2 nostrils and forced me to breathe through my mouth (This has multiple risks). At 16 i went to a hospital with my parents to correct this.

The doctors send me home because ""i might still grow"" and ""it could change things"". Of course nothing changed going from 16 to 2X.

So, if a minor operation with basically no risks besides the anesthesia is declined due to age, even though it has clear medical advantages, then a treatment in even earlier ages (we are talking puberty after all) with unclear risks and unclear advantages should be declined as well.

5143,"&gt;In order for you to have quality government emerging from a direct democracy you have to have an educated, informed and politically engaged public.

That is definitely true. What also is important is to take enough time to educate the people on a certain subject (that's in part a reason why political decisions take some time in Switzerland). As you point out later in your comment, it works well in Switzerland because there is a political culture that has developed over a long time period and that is really part of every day life now.

I do however not agree with the notion that direct democracy wouldn't work in bigger countries, e.g. the US which you mention is probably the example with the next-most direct democratic decision, albeit on a state level (which can be as populous as European countries). In general there are multiple different options on how to combine direct democratic elements into a representative democracy, e.g. to have more control on the laws/constitutional articles that are subject to vote, one can limit it do referenda that already have passed the parliament. If deemed necessary  additional safety measures can be considered (e.g. double majority instead of single majority). In Switzerland referenda (mandatory and facultative) make up 2/3 of all direct democratic votes, while the other 1/3 are initiatives. Those are initiated directly by the people. For initiatives and mandatory referenda a double majority is necessary (people and cantons), only for facultative referenda (no changes in constitution) a single majority is enough.",,/r/europe/comments/est8h7/europe_leads_the_democracy_index/ffefums/,curiossceptic,1579846400
5144,"You could *really* fairly do this by expected remaining life expectancy conditioned onto the duration of the decision.

I once did a calculation for Austria, and they wouldn't loose much power, as for a five year term this would give a 30 years old a weight of maybe 4.9 and for a 70 years old 4.5 and an 80 years old still around 4.

On the other hand, for a constitutional change or an indefinite one (like Brexit) that would change to a weight of like 50 for a 30 years old one and maybe 5 for an 80 years old one.

So even tho Poland wasn't like Soviet Union, you still compare them because of some supposed ""intent"" **you** ascribed to them. Unless you have some secret historical letters between Polish nobles and king that talk about plans for ethnic cleansing, your ""intent"" is just your nationalistic narrative.

 ""You didn't do it but you were thinking about doing it!"" Is something you hear in comedies. That is how bad your reasoning is, its literally the logic from a parody. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""~~Forced~~ polonization"" **sounds kinda like** ""re-education"" **to me**, chief.

Ya, that's your delusion. sounds like it to you, not others. Polonisation was voluntary, just because it was popular doesn't mean it was forced on people. 

&gt;Also, are you a fucking idiot?

Apparently you are. I just gave you a specific example of a mechanism used to make the Irish lower class citizens. Here is another method, In Imperial Germany when property owning Poles died, there land could not be inherited but would be given to German settlers to Germanize the land. 

But you, 

&gt;Yeah I just talked about that, tho.

Still weren't able to explain **how** they were forced to become 3rd class citizens, you know why that is, because they weren't. 

And this

&gt;The only way to become *shlyakhta(nobility)*  was to give up your religion (that was KINDA a big deal back then) and language and go ""full Pole"".

Is not a valid because it is a straight up lie. You are just blatantly lying now. First of all it was the Kingdom of Poland so learning Polish and Latin is just common sense, you aren't going to get far in England without knowing English either you fool. 

And nobody forced you to give up your language, considering how similar the languages were many would have been bilingual in the East. The fact that there were nobles who supported printing in Ruthenian just shows how much propaganda you have been fed. 

In the union of Hrodlo The Lithuanian Grand Duke also King of Poland literally made all the Ruthenian Boyars in the duchy szlachta (shlyahta), so don't lie to me and say you had to give up your language and religion. 

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, the monarchy is an antiquated institution which has long seen it's day. It's unbelievable that we still live in a world where someone can be born with a royal title and be treated as if they're somehow inherently better than everyone else. And this also stands with billionaires as well. The reason why people detest that kind of stuff is because their lavish lifestyle comes at the expense of the masses. It's our surplus labour that goes to keeping their posteriors sitting on velvet cushions. And for what? For tradition? Because we've always done a certain thing a certain way? 

This goes to a much deeper issue than just a few people with asinine titles sitting on thrones with silly hats and clothing. It goes to a deeper issue of the people born into positions with outsize influence who then use said power for their own benefit at our expense, such as our dear Queen Elizabeth storing her money in a tax haven to keep it out of the hands of the British government (see Paradise Papers).

We shouldn't just accept the circumstances that we all find ourselves in as a given.

The EU already has that. Germany, a country of 83 million people, has 96 seats in the European Parliament. Malta, which has 0.5 million people, has 6 seats. Any EU law must pass the European Parliament (which is directly elected by EU citizens).

In the Council, every member has one vote, and every law has to pass both the European Parliament and the Council. The Council is made up of members' governments and any bill needs the approval of 55%, 72%, or 100% of members representing at least 65% of the population. In other words, the bottom 12 EU countries, which make up just 6% of the population, can block anything and everything.

I don't think I need go get into the ""rotating presidency"" bit, everyone else already addressed it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  It also forces the parties to fight for votes from swing states who don't really like either party. 

It also disenfranchises people who vote for a popular candidate in their state. You vote for X? Pointless, he already got 60% of votes in your state, you might as well stayed home, he would have received the same number of Electoral College votes from your state anyway. You voted for Y? Pointless, he only got 49% of the vote, meaning he lost your state, so you and the remaning 48.9% might as well have stayed home because he receives the same number of EC votes regardless -- 0.

If you have ever studied in a good university or at least with *good* teacher, the first thing he will say when preparing you for an essay / thesis / scientific article:

&gt;Never use Wikipedia as source.

You will never find an article in any respected scientific journal / abstract / conference proceedings an article where Wikipedia is among the sources. 

Why? Because Wikipedia is written by *us*. By the community. Not by community of scientists. Not by community of physicist. Not by community of historians. But the community of people. 

You can open any Wiki-article right now, write whatever you think is necessary and back up your words with **any** source. It can be both the works of Socrates and the article in some Croatian tabolide from 1996. Nobody gives a shit. 

Let's check Wiki source about that book and ""mandatory to read""-thing:

[Dunlop, John B. (July 30, 2004) ""Russia’s New—and Frightening—“Ism”""](https://www.hoover.org/research/russias-new-and-frightening-ism)

&gt;Few books published in Russia during the post-communist period have exerted such an influence on Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites as Aleksandr Dugin’s 1997 neo-fascist treatise Osnovy geopolitiki: Geopoliticheskoe budushchee Rossii (Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geo-political Future of Russia). The impact of this intended “Eurasianist” textbook on key Russian elites testifies to the worrisome rise of fascist ideas and sentiments during the late Yeltsin and the Putin periods.

So, where are the sources? Words of individual representatives of the Russian Ministry, Russian journalists? Links to existing journalistic research? Or at least for existing articles? Nope. Just point-blank statement. Alright. But I don't know either the author or this magazine. Let's open the articles for [the same month](https://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/2004-no-3) to make sure this author / journal is objective before I believe them by word:

&gt; [By most conventional measures of power—economic, military, and cultural—there has never been an empire mightier than that of the United States today.](https://www.hoover.org/research/reluctant-empire)

&gt;[Why low drug prices in Canada are too good to be true](https://www.hoover.org/research/high-price-cheap-drugs)

&gt;[**Eurabia?** Niall Ferguson examines the impact of Europe’s growing Muslim population on a continent that otherwise faces low birthrates and aging populations.](https://www.hoover.org/research/eurabia)

Something tells me that this journal has a certain kind of narrative and the smallest share of bias...

Let's check the second source.

""The Unlikely Origins of Russia’s Manifest Destiny"" by [Charles Clover](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/geopolitics-russia-mackinder-eurasia-heartland-dugin-ukraine-eurasianism-manifest-destiny-putin/)

&gt;The Englishman’s elevation to the status of grand mufti of Atlantic power was assisted by Dugin, who in 1997 published The Foundations of Geopolitics, one of the most curious, impressive, and terrifying books to come out of Russia during the entire post-Soviet era, and one that became a pole star for a broad section of Russian hardliners. 

Still waiting for sources. 

&gt;“There has probably not been another book published in Russia during the post-communist period which has exerted a comparable influence on Russian military, police, and statist foreign policy elites,” writes historian John Dunlop, a Hoover Institution specialist on the Russian right.

Well, at least something. Let's check that John Dunlop words. Wait. This is the same dude that wrote the first article! [Dunlop, John B. (July 30, 2004) ""Russia’s New—and Frightening—“Ism”""](https://www.hoover.org/research/russias-new-and-frightening-ism). 

Alright, let's google his work, maybe there something more. Google show us this [article](https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/the-dangerous-philosopher-behind-putins-strategy-to-grow-russian-power-at-americas-expense)

&gt;The Most Dangerous Philosopher in the World
&gt;[Here’s a paper on Dugin and his book by Hoover Institution’s John B. Dunlop](http://www.4pt.su/en/content/aleksandr-dugin%E2%80%99s-foundations-geopolitics). 


Yeah, an [article](http://www.4pt.su/en/content/aleksandr-dugin%E2%80%99s-foundations-geopolitics). The first thing I want to note is that if you go to the main page of this site, then you fucking see this fucking [shit](http://www.4pt.su/en/content/radical-object-necro-ontology-dark-enlightenment-negarestanis-philosophy). But let's read text:

&gt;Two years later, at the founding congress of the new “Eurasia” movement, Dugin boasted, “I am the author of the book Foundation of Geopolitics, which has been adopted as a textbook in many [Russian] educational institutions.” During the same congress, the aforementioned General Klokotov – now a professor emeritus but one who continued to teach at the academy – noted that the theory of geopolitics had been taught as a subject at the General Staff Academy since the early 1990’s, and that in the future it would “serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new [military] command.” [25].  Dugin’s book is presumably being used at present as a textbook at the General Staff Academy.

This is a serious statement. And it is even backed up by some source.

&gt;See “[Stenogramma raboty uchreditel’nogo s’’ezda Obshcherossiiskogo Politicheskogo Obshchestvennogo](http://eurasia.com.ru:8101/syezd.htm). 

Well, this is a broken Russian and the link is already dead, but let's google it anyway.

[Стенограмма работы учредительного съезда ОПОД «Евразия»](http://eurasia.com.ru/stenogramma.html)

&gt;Therefore, there is a proposal to give, nevertheless, a lecture to the Academy of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Nikolai Klokotov.

&gt;Dear comrades, colleagues, friends! I don’t want to make any kind of speech here, or take some detailed topic, I would just like to congratulate everyone that we finally managed to make sense of ourselves as sons of the fatherland, to get together here and, holding hands together, start to promote our Eurasian idea into the practical affairs of our country.&lt;...&gt;As a man who has served in the armed forces for more than forty years, I am a professor of strategy of the General Staff, I have always stood and will remain in our Eurasian positions, and I think that at the time I came, literally 7-8 years ago, to the General Staff Academy, the theory of geopolitics and Eurasianism itself **will be further developed and served** as a powerful ideological base for the preparation of our command personnel. This is what we are doing. I am sure that we will always have healthy forces among the people and the armed forces **will be** brought up in Eurasian traditions and ideas. Thank you for attention.

Even taking into account the fact that they are all participants in a fucking sect (read this transcript in full, they are crazy, lol), he still spoke in the **future tense**. 

So, in the end of all of this, the only source is the sect participant-Lieutenant, who said that he would like to use these sectarian things in his department. And Dugin himself, assuring that everyone uses his book. 

The problem is that I personally do not really trust the person who writes about fucking ""[Vampire orders](https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/85174/22/Dugin_-_Konspirologiya.html)"":

&gt;In other words, representatives of the Vampire Order stand behind the ""humanitarian"" movements for ""evolution"" and ""survival"".

5371,"&gt; Minor Asia coast is not connected by land with Greece, Thrace does. It is reasonable for both countries to settle troops in there. I don't even know why I answered that.

Yes, but islands becoming DMZ was also ratified by treaties signed by Greece and Allied Powers and it's status is kept to this day. Just like how you claim Turkey violating international treaties by violating UNCLOS (which Turkey isn't a signatory of and nonparticipant, like United States and Israel also aren't among a few other nations), you have to be fair and openmindedly consider when the other side rightfully makes a claim about Greece also violating international treaties, including the treaty which is the reason the lslands now belong to Greece instead of Italy, which stipulates certain conditions, one of which mandates the Islands to be DMZ, regardless of how threatened Greece might feel of a possible Turkish invasion.    
    
Just like how you expect Turks to fairly consider your claim, you should show the same fair approach and admit when your country also violates a treaty for which you are a signatory of. Your country put signature on a contract and violates the conditions of it, which would even give a legal argument to challenge Greek ownership of the islands for violating terms and conditions of your contract.   
    
Cyprus the same thing. Both sides violate laws. Greece for supporting a bloody coup which resulted in murder of Turkish Cypriots (which, by the way, is conveniently left out of all arguments when making genocide arguments for Turkey, because apparently killing Turks is fair game but all others is a crime simply because of your low IQ view of Turks, which, in your eye, all Turks are dumb peasants, half human half animal barbarians and must be kept in zoos). But I got news for you. You aren't genetically different than Turks. Muslims of Ottoman Empire, which included a lot of Greek converts to Islam intermarried for centuries. For half a millenia, Greek people lived under Ottoman rule. Not Turkish. Ottoman. Turkish identity was created by Young Turks members who, like Greek nationalists, were influenced by the popular nationalism trend in Europe, which led to many wars and break up of Ottoman Empire, led to creation of ""nation states"".     
    
Before that Greeks weren't Greeks either. They were ""Rum (Roman) Orthadox"".   
   
Also many of us has family roots from somewhere else. My father's family was deported to Turkey from Thessaloniki after Balkan wars, it was their country for generations, and before that they were deported from Spain and other parts of Europe. My mother's family fled to Istanbul from Circassia fleeing the Russian Circassian genocide in the 19th century. And what's a ""your pro-Turk types""? You know, today city of Trabzon has some of the most fanatically nationalist people in Turkey and they are the descendents of Pontus Rums (Greeks) who converted to Islam through out centuries and mixed with other Muslims of the empire. We all have roots from somewhere else in the Empire and you are in no position to ""talk down at people"".  
    
Before making accusations and racist comments on someone, try to understand what he's trying to say and try to look up on his other comments to see his general view on things.   
   
Also, speaking of treaties and international law, [Turkey has a guarantor status on Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guarantee_(1960)) which was signed between Turkey, Greece, Cyprus and Great Britain. Greeks killing Turks was wrong. Turkey intervening was her legal right to protect Turkish Cypriots. But then Turkey killing Greek Cypriots and occupying the land was wrong too.   
    
But like Israel occupying and now annexing Golan Heights for her security, Turkey also does it for her security and security of Cypriots. I wish Turkey and Greece could talk in a problem solving manner but neither country wants to.    
    
And no, I don't support Erdogan's foreign policy or any policies or vote for him. Unfortunately he wins a race against 4 candidates who are even worse than him, if you can imagine. Turkey needs to replace him asap. If Turkey treated her NATO allies better and approached this issue with a friendly, problem solving leader, I'm sure Turkey would also be invited to Israel-Cyprus deal.

While there are definitely researchers who claim gentrification displaces residents, there is also ample research to the contrary which shows that not only is there no difference in move-out rates in gentrified/non-gentrified areas, but also that long-time residents in gentrifying areas benefit by gentrification (better incomes, better schools, better jobs in the area, increased net worth, etc).

Even better. At least if it was a triumvirate, the bickering could resemble some manner of democratic debate at times.  
  
Making it a city-state (because I know you said that's not what you propose, but then *what*? Again, I arrived to the city-state conclusion from the premise that the city *exists* and someone has to govern it, independent or not. Not much we can do about it) will only make the problem permanent.  
  
Letting the city be part of a country (or two) at least leaves the framework for improving the situation democratically. If the country(-ies) become more democratic in the future (no matter how far, as long as it happens at some point. With the alternative, that point is never. I have to give that to the Vatican model: it lasts), not only will the problems be resolved, but also, it will solve all the other problems the 1 million people living there, that do not have anything to do with random religions and sacred sites. Matters of democracy, economy and welfare.  
  
And I'm not concerned about how convoluted it is. It's only a concern because of the surrounding tension (which is enough to cause trouble on its own anyway). Without the tension and in a more democratic state, the whole French territory and Jordanian church things would become arcane quirks, like the City of London being semi-independent because Romans or Mount Athos not allowing women in because Ottomans.

5471,"Nah, not really. I see them basically in the same way I view old historical buildings or castle ruins, which also cost money to keep around. It's a nice thing to preserve as it's part of our history and it's pretty convenient to have a national representative that isn't political. As long as they do their duties (as heads of state) it makes sense to pay them and if they don't they would be cut off. It's not that much money anyway, relatively speaking, especially not if you account for revenue from tourism. My only problem is that the position is inherited and I personally think we should return to having them elected by the people (as we in Sweden did before the 1500s), but then it's of course likely that we lose the apolitical part. Over all, I wouldn't be mad if we got rid of them, but to me the pros slightly outweighs the cons, so in my opinion we can keep them for now.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/esrtjc/heirs_to_european_thrones/ffdmnhs/,Glenn_XVI_Gustaf,1579824127

It's a big part of what makes the country unique/special, if your on holidays with every person you meet sooner or later the talk will move to the principality and how it is to life under a prince and so on. 

The different princes in the last century or so also helped quite a bit, even with a substantial part of their own private funds, to transform the country from a poor farmers country to a wealthy one with a substantial banking sector but also a remarkable amount of industry for it's size. That gave them, rightfully, a very good reputation among the people. 

The current prince is an economist, he likes power and he knows how to bargain if you have a strong hand... being part of a nations identity is a rather good start. When he saw that there was a push towards more democracy he took his chance and made a counter push with his version of the constitution.

The prince went as far as to threatened to move out of the country, even to take his name with him, saying we'd have to rename the country and so on. He basically said either you take my new constitution or I piss off and take that part of your national identity with me. He played it quite nasty imho, with half-truths and very manipulative arguments. And the people bought the bluff.  

It's all bullshit of course, he can't just force the country to rename itself. He also lives completely tax-free, for a multi billionaire a very nice thing... and he very literally stands above the law, he can not be brought to court no matter what.

5539,"Who said anything about a state. I'm not sure you understand what I mean, so I'll explain:  
  
When I said ""unless we abandon the city, that city needs to belong to *someone*"", that's what I meant. Someone needs to administer it. I don't care if it's a nation, or a mayor or an independent city, or a committee or a religious institution. It's still *someone*.  
  
And as long as that someone does not exist in a vacuum, it will be influenced.  
  
Say we do what you propose and make a common institution of all faiths. First question: *Which religions?*. Jerusalem is holy for Christianity, Islam and Judaism, but only Judaism can (and even then, only if you ignore a lot of people of different denominations) be considered a single religion. So we have a Jewish representative elected by a council of Rabbi (it's not how it works but let's say we organise a religion that is made so it is not centrally organised). All well and good. But what about the Muslim representative? Will it be chosen by Sunni or by Shia? Or will we have two, one for each? And what about Christians, will the representative be Catholic, Orthodox (who, unlike Catholics, don't have one pope, but instead are divided in many, many patriarchies. So will that Orthodox be Russian or Greek? Serbian or Romanian?), Nestorian, Coptic, etc...  
And if we choose to get around the problem by having a representative for each, we end up with a situation where the council is made of 25 Christians, 2 Muslims and one Jew. It'll be great...  
So there is no way of making a commission that establishes neutrality both between religious categories and between individual religions, and *even if we do*…  
Say we managed to heal the Great Schism as well as to decide once and for all who the successor of Muhammed is. Now both Christianity and Islam are united and we have 1 Jew, 1 Christian and 1 Muslim, each representing their religions. Remember when I said outside influence will happen. Expect a lot of situations where decisions are made by 2-1 for the Judeo-Christians, with support from Israel and the US against the Muslims supported by the Islamic world. Which is exactly the current situation, so great job doing nothing.  
  
Now, also, the differences between Vatican and Jerusalem.  
  
The Vatican is not *really* a holy place in and of itself. Nothing religious ever happened. It's only where one of the 5 patriarchies of the Roman Empire was established, which became the Papacy. The Vatican is the HQ of Catholicism. It is only important to the Pope because that's where the Pope lives. So I don't see how you see this as a solution for solving conflicts. Vatican never solved any conflict, because there is no conflict to be had when there is just one party.  
Vatican is not a *city*. It really is just the HQ of Catholicism and it's ""population"" are just the people working there in upper administration at a certain point in time. Look at a map of the Vatican, it's the Church, gardens and a wall around it all. Jerusalem is a big city, with important sites scattered all over. A Jerusalem city-state will have *a lot* of administrative, economic and political problems. It will have an economy, people doing business, *with other countries*. It will have a population which will need to be led.  
So while Vatican is just one party deciding very few, narrow questions of a religious matter, Jerusalem will be three parties deciding broad matters of a *political matter*. The amount of friction generated by this arrangement will be huge.  
  
Not to mention, you know, the idea of taking one million people, Israeli and Palestinian, who live and work in a *country* or other and suddenly putting them into a situation where they live in a bizarre, artificial, theocratic city-state. At least a country can (if it gets it's act together) allow them to lead themselves democratically.  
  
I think you took ""Vatican is a country"" a bit too seriously. There are many reasons why the Vatican is just a quirk in the system that is autonomous, and not an *actual* country, with an economy and politics and a big, diverse population.",May Europe stand together,/r/europe/comments/eshkk7/macron_berates_israeli_police_at_jerusalem_church/ffd9tsz/,TheDigitalGentleman,1579816254

So for example, it's unthinkable that the queen wouldn't cosign a law passed by the parliament, she exercises her role of commander in chief through the government i.e. the minister of defense and confirms the prime minister who can form a stable government as decided in the parliament. The last king, I believe it was in the 1920s, who refused to respect the wishes of the parliament, was not only almost forced to abdicate, but he almost caused a revolution and the end of the monarchy.

Again, if you've democratically delegated some sovereignty, it's not somehow ""lost"" in democratic sense. That is the whole point of delegating it. That's how sovereignty works. You know that in principle YOU are the sovereign of Denmark, right? Yourself and all the other 5.8 mln people in Denmark, are the real sovereign. Well, you then democratically delegate your power to your MPs. This doesn't mean Denmark is no longer a democracy because someone else wields the power and not its people. It also doesn't mean you're not the sovereign anymore. It just means you delegate whatever powers you want to the MPs so all 5.8 mln of you don't have to concern yourselves with that.

That's literally the idea behind countries delegating sovereignty to supra-national entities. They, for whatever reason, decide to democratically delegate some sovereignty.

5644," AFD is prevented from fulfilling its statutory obligations. The Berlin state association currently has no way of holding a party conference in the capital to carry out the new election of the state board, which has been required for months by the AfD statutes and the law. A party conference planned for this weekend is canceled. The reason is external threats.

This becomes clear from a judgment of the Berlin regional court, which had been called by the AfD. She applied for provisional legal protection against the landlady of a hall that the AfD had contracted for the party conference on December 20. However, on January 6, the landlady announced the withdrawal from the contract because she and an employee had been threatened. The AfD now wanted to get to court that the landlord had to make the room available. The court refused. Because the landlord ""made credible that an employee had been threatened because of the planned event""

This created a new location for the landlord. The court found a risk that ""goes far beyond the contractual obligation to provide event rooms"". The landlord is free to decide whether to take the risk or to refuse this additional burden.

That the reasons for the risk, the threats, were politically motivated can be considered certain. There was evidence, among other things, on the Internet that groups willing to use violence mobilized against the AfD party conference. After the court decision, the AfD stated that ""extreme left-wing Antifa had prevented the state party convention with threats of violence"". The head of the country, [Georg Pazderski](http://welt.de/205012508) , said: ""If violence attacks democracy, it is terror."" The meeting was canceled: ""The party conference must, of course, be canceled,"" said Pazderski. A new appointment is not yet foreseeable.

The state party had previously unsuccessfully tried twice to hold a party convention. In September 2019, her lease of a public hall in the Tempelhof-Schöneberg district was terminated by a city councilor from the Greens because the space could not be rented out for state political events.

When the party then set a new date for mid-November, there was nowhere to be found for a member party convention with around 400 participants - although the AfD said it had directed more than 100 inquiries to potential landlords.

Since it was therefore impossible to conduct the election of the board, the AfD federal executive had to set up a new regional arbitration court at the end of the year, which appointed an emergency executive of the regional association. Pazderski also belongs to this emergency board, but he and the other members cannot do much. An emergency board may only make the most necessary decisions to maintain operations.

Some landlords fear for their existence

The Berlin process is not an isolated case. Again and again [the AfD](http://welt.de/203967240) is confronted with hosts or other room renters who have already agreed to the party to leave. There is much to suggest that a significant proportion of those landlords feel threatened by calls to Antifa campaigns as well as anonymous calls and letters. Some fear their economic existence because they are announced boycott campaigns. Thus, the AfD has increasing problems finding rooms, especially in West Germany and Berlin.

It initially looked like this in Viersen in North Rhine-Westphalia. There, the Bundestag member Kay Gottschalk wanted to hold a New Year reception on Thursday with AfD Federal Vice Beatrix von Storch. The hall in Viersen was booked, a lease was signed and the full rent was paid in advance by the AfD. The CDU and SPD had already met in the hall.

But shortly before the AfD reception, the hall lessee terminated the rental contract and gave the reason, ""It was not yet possible to predict when the contract was signed,"" what lasting economic damage your event for me as the lessor, but also the hall par excellence in the future will pull itself "". There are indications that the tenant felt pressured from the outside. In this case in Viersen, however, the AfD managed to get an injunction, and on Thursday afternoon it looked as if the reception was taking place as planned.

In Berlin, on the other hand, a political decision is now being delayed due to the party congress being canceled with the election of the board. Because neither Pazderski nor von Storch, who also belongs to the emergency board, want to stand for the chief position. And because Gottfried Curio, a member of the Bundestag, is being treated as a possible candidate, there could be a clear shift to the right in the previously moderate Berlin AfD. But there won't be a decision about that for the time being.",,/r/europe/comments/esyauz/party_conference_cancelled_afd_accuses_antifa_the/ffcx3b3/,d_agostino,1579809077

But the real power behind Tesla is that they are vertically integrated with the largest battery manufacture (Panasonic) in the world. The batteries are the most expensive component and the weak link in the supply chain. That's why Tesla has been dumping money into and playing up their ""gigafactories"". When other car companies make a big push to electric they are going to have to have to either start building their own battery factories (slow) or contact out their production (expensive). So it really doesn't matter what happens next quarter or next year because the foundation was laid back in 2014 when Tesla made a huge gamble partnering with Panasonic.

Orgs like the NSU, Volksfront, Blood and Honor, the troupe behind the guy who tried to shoot up the synagogue in Halle. Their existence has been recognised by the Verfassungsschutz and validated time and time again by the court system. Its not about a political motivation, but politically motivated crimes. THOSE ORGANISATIONS STATED GOAL IS TO MURDER PEOPLE. Jesus.

The prosecution in the instance of Combat 18 being such a network just lacked legal grounds to prosecute individual members that didnt commit high crimes themselves without the organisation being formally recognised as unconstitutional-
Membership in unconstitutional organisations is a crime-
which is decided upon by due process in the court system. The same rule allows us to prosecute ISIS members who havent committed crimes yet for associating and helping an organisation by membership and in itself non-criminal means.

Talking about repression in this instance is especially cynical since those organisations have been killing people and getting away with it for years. They have their martyrs who commit high crimes and a large underbelly providing money, weapons and shelter from prosecution. Those people are willingly helping in those crimes in form of the organisations target but without declaring the organisation unconstitutional they simply get away due to a policy of no direct knowledge of the actual crime, making membership in the organisation often the only way to reach them in a meaningfull sense, which is why the legal process to declare those organisations unconstitutional takes years, often decades. Again, they are very real and a major threat- the NSU didnt shy away from planting nail bombs in pedestrian zones- even the Islamists havent tried that yet- and killing police officers, years before they were even officially recognised.

And its perfectly legal and democratic to dexlare an organisation unconstitutional and forbidden. Its called defensive democracy.

5680,"Hm not necessarily true actually.

So for European Scandinavians it's relatively clear:

&gt; The Battle Axe culture, a local variant of the Corded Ware culture, which was itself an offshoot of the Yamnaya culture, emerged in southern Scandinavia in the early 3rd millennium BC. Modern-day Scandinavians have been found to carry more ancestry from the Yamnaya culture than any other population in Europe.

For Sami, their genetic history is really complicated, where does one even become a 'Sami'. They seem to have some European mixed in so are they even 'Sami' before this. Regarding their language:

&gt;  the Sami proto-language developed in South Finland or in Karelia around 2000–2500 years ago, spreading then to northern Fennoscandia

So their language is younger than the presence of Scandinavian Battle Axe culture people in Scandinavia.

Plus you say ""northern Europe"" which is rather deceiving as Sami/proto-Sami were living in the Finnish region and then in the very northern region of Norway/Sweden. An accurate term would be ""Far Northern Scandinavia"" than ""Northern Europe"" which in common parlance generally means places like Denmark - which naturally never had Sami people and to which Europeans are the indigenous people, along with the rest of Europe.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/esrbdq/sami_village_beats_swedish_government_in_court_to/ffcxthn/,rapter_nz,1579809503

In the economist ranking (which in reality is more of a survey of undisclosed expert opinions) Switzerland usually doesn't score well in the ""political participation"" category.

I suppose for that category they (in part) look at average voter turnout, which usually is low in Switzerland (usually a bit below 50%) compared to other countries. However, this also highlights a limitation of such studies, e.g. it is hard to compare different systems using the same indicators. In Switzerland there are votes on a national level every 3 months, while in most other countries nationwide votes occur every few years. More detailed analysis in Switzerland has shown that 80% of Swiss citizens participate in votes (25% in all votes, 55% in selected votes - 20% do not participate in any votes). This number is again comparable to that of most other European countries.",,/r/europe/comments/est8h7/europe_leads_the_democracy_index/ffckn58/,curiossceptic,1579801480

Your view of phasing out negotiations based on the fact that the UK's starting point is that of regulatory alignment with the EU is partially correct.

The problem is that even if the goods that are in conformity with EU rules but for which there is no specific agreement in the treaty/FTA, they will *still* have to be checked. That is the default legal position. Sure, the checks might be trivial, but there will still be friction.

In the case of services, I can imagine in the best case certifications of equivalence will be required, and in the worst and outright ban on UK services companies being able to operate in the single market.

So, friction again.

This would damage the current government politically, after all their promises of a quick no tariffs/no friction trade deal with the EU.

The EU is seeking an agreement with the UK, not Boris Johnson (who will not be PM forever) and whatever character objections you have against the man are a weak excuse for creating a highly asymmetric future relationship that the UK cannot possible agree to. 

&gt; The fact that Boris refuses to negotiate beyond 9 months, putting a rush on the process, sort of reinforces the perception that he’s trying to sneak something by us.

1) Its part of his negotiating position
2) After watching how the EU dragged its feet and ran down the clock in stage 1, is it any surprise that he's keen to limit the capacity for them to do the same this time? 
3) It actually provides an incentive for both sides to act. Just yesterday, Axel Weber the chairman of UBS, praised this approach at the WEF saying that it would drive the talks forward.

After the way the EU has treated Switzerland over the past year, why should anyone trust them? Their behavior was nothing short of thuggish and actions wholly disproportionate.

They'll be taking equity into account.

This isn't some sort of new or shocking development -- a number of people mistakenly believe that buying is a radically-better move than renting for that reason.

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/wealth-manager-buying-a-home-is-usually-a-terrible-investment.html

&gt; Say you live in Brooklyn, New York, and pay $2,500 a month to rent. If you buy your own place, you might pay $5,000 a month between your mortgage, taxes and other maintenance costs, Mallouk gives as an example. (Other financial experts estimate that, thanks to home ownership costs, buying could cost you about 40% more than renting.)
&gt;
&gt;“If you take the difference and you save it, that extra $2,500 you’re saving in a diversified portfolio is almost certainly, over a long period of time, going to grow to be worth more than what your home equity would have been worth if you had just put the money into a home,” he says.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/esqj36/how_the_obsession_with_homeownership_ruins_the/ffbz04e/,duisThias,1579787212

5917,"&gt; But shouldn't a trade deal be about improving the terms of access with regards to tariff and non-tariff (i.e. regulatory) barriers?

Right, and we can start with getting rid of the ridiculous, protectionist, EU tariffs on non-EU wine. 

&gt; Depends on who has the greater leverage in these negotiations and the size of the respective markets. Which clearly favours the US.......especially since the UK desperately needs a trade deal with at least one of its biggest trading partners (EU, US and China) once the transition period expires at the end of the year. 

No it doesn't. You are projecting round 1 of the EU negotiations on future UK bilateral trade negotiations with other countries. In the former, failure to agree a deal had massive potential downside risks to the status quo. With other countries, failure to agree a deal means the continuation of the status quo, there are only upside risks in the case that something is agreed. 

And the fact that you seem to think that the UK is 'desperate' to get trade deals suggests some level of bias that predisposes your opinions. 

&gt; Also, the US hasnt exactly been acting rational under Trump when it comes to trade agreements.

The irrational US policy on trade has *all* been directed towards countries where the US has a significant trade deficit in goods (because that is all the Great Orange Menace seems to care about). The UK has an almost neutral trade balance with the US, its one of the reasons he loves this country so much and why there are reasons to believe that his behavior will be more rational towards us. Nevermind that he appears to hate the EU and loves Brexit.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/esh907/the_eu_is_planning_to_give_the_uk_a_much_worse/ffbz2mr/,MyFavouriteAxe,1579787269

At first I thought maybe Europe education is just harder to pass- but that’s not true- the application admission to college is lower in Europe than in US as well.

5938,"The Dutch King is part of the government. He advises the ministers on policies, but whatever is discussed is a state secret. 

The Dutch King has to sign all laws before they go into effect. The Dutch King never refused to sign a law, but if he would refuse to sign a law, then the responsible minister would probably be held accountable. Which could be a good reason for a minister to listen to him.

The Dutch King speaks for the entire government and the government cannot disagree with itself, so the prime minister could be held responsible for whatever he says. This is the reason why the Dutch King usually does not involve himself with politics in public.

The council of state is a governmental organ that adives the parliament and government on all laws. But this organ also acts as the supreme court (of administrative affairs). The King is the chairman of this organ. A role which he usually delegates to someone he trusts.

The King has certain legal powers, which do require a minister to co-sign to execute them. The King has the power to appoint and fire the entire parliament, the senate, all ministers, the city mayors and judges. You need approval of the government, including the King, to become a minister, mayor or judge.

All politicians and soldiers have sworn allegiance to the King. And the government in its entirety controls the military.

The Dutch King often goes abroad on diplomatic and economic missions with the captains of industry. He can open all doors.

The grandmother of the King owned 25% of Shell. Although he denies having Shell stocks right now, nobody can verify that statement. He could own it through shell companies. Giving him a lot of influence on the Dutch economy.

The King is above any (criminal or tax) laws. And cannot be held accountable. If he would break the law, a minister would be held accountable as a scapegoat.

The King plays a major role in Dutch culture. Our national holiday is his birthday. The national anthem is about his distant grandfather. Our national color is his last name. He is indirectly descendant from a war hero that liberated our country. So there is a lot of propaganda surrounding his person.

So going by the data (unless you have any other data to contradict it), it doesn't seem to have that much of an impact.

Because of course it does, monarchies in the modern world are only there out of tradition, they hold no power. Only in certain countries like Saudi Arabia or the UAE to they still hold power, and I don't think you'll find many people who are willing to defend that kind of system.

&gt;They literally have an official position and get money and live in lavish palaces simply because of who their parents are, it goes everything a democracy represents.

That's an interesting framing.
One can also frame it as:
They are forced to have a certain, very public lifestyle where they get a ton of attention but zero political power purely because of their ancestry.

&gt;it goes everything a democracy represents.

Democracy is a system of government which works, I don't really care much about what it 'represents'.
I just think it's a very strange way to pick your battles.
You have tons of millionares donating and bribing politicians, influencing political thought, silencing campaigns etc. 
You know, things that actually hinder the way the system is supposed to work, as opposed to tradititional, powerless institutions that do nothing.

And btw the % of fossil energy has also been reduced from 58% in 2000 
 to below 50% now in the same time span. Renewables are at 35% now.
Nuclear will be completeley phased out in the next couple of years and fossils by ~2038.

5972,"&gt; That is why negotiating a trade deal is hard and will not happen overnight

No, it is because of protectionist lobbies and competing domestic interests. 

&gt; Everyone has to agree on what is a good trade. 

Much easier in the case of the UK. We do not have a protectionist mindset (like the French), nor do we predicate our economy on running a trade surplus like the Germans and the EU as a whole). The UK imports far, far more than it exports, which makes the UK market highly attractive from a potential trading partner perspective. That gives the UK some leverage in a way that you seem unwilling to acknowledge. 

&gt; But on top of that, whenever there is an asymmetry in sizes as it exists you can already expect an asymmetry in leverage.

It counts for very little. If the UK feels like it is being treated unfairly by say the US, India, China, etc... then they are free to simply walk away from the table with no consequences. We currently trade with these countries on WTO terms and would continue to do so. The status quo would not change. 

The delicious irony here, which nearly all of the armchair commentators or r/europe completely fail to appreciate, is that the EU wants to maintain as much access to the UK market as possible, and the US wants to open it up as much as they can. Both will be competing for UK market share and unreasonable behavior from one of these will only serve to push the UK further into the orbit of the other (on trade, security, defense and other areas of cooperation).
