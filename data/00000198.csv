Macrom hating the poor bullshit rhetoric? That is just a complete and total lie ! A TON of laws have passed SPECIFICALLY for poorer people ! Like higher (+100€) minimum pensions for the retired ? Like the transfer of social contributions from the retired (except the poorest retired) to the workers ? Like the removal of the local housing tax except for richer people ?The ONLY law that was passed specifically for rich people was the removal of the ""Impôt sur la Fortune"", which was scientifically a terrible, terrible tax which did not succeed at transferring money from the rich to the poor. On the contrary, the increase of the CSG hits the wealthy because it taxes CAPITAL gains, which is something I'm sure you're very happy about, right ? What about thr ""poverty plan"" ? It's seen by the social sector as one of the best social plans ever written by a government, because it really tackles the root issues of poverty in France . What about the minimum wage increase starting January 1st?

You are a scaremongering nationalist,nothing more. There is no paper that shows any change of income or job security of locals after an influx of people. Ricardo's theories of economic trade hold up more than the stinking pile of shit you pulled out of your ass or what you dare call informed opinion.

In this paper we first show that the timing and skill distribution of Immigrants to the U.S. between 1970 and 2014 imply they did not contribute to the decline in the wages of native, non-college educated workers – including high school dropouts – at the national level. We then review other evidence at the local level, which implies immigration is not associated with lower non-college wages. Rather, higher immigration seems associated with higher average (and college-level) wages.

https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/impact-immigration-wages-unskilled-workers

During all other decades, the immigrant supply and native wage growth are positively associated

https://www.nap.edu/read/23550/chapter/2

Interest in studying high-skilled groups has gained momentum as the H1-B and other visa programs have contributed to a rapid rise in the inflow of professional foreign-born workers (about 250,000 people per year during the last decade). Several studies have found a positive impact of skilled immigration on the wages and employment of both college-educated and noncollege-educated natives.

The literature on employment impacts finds little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers.

On average, individuals in the first generation are more costly to governments, mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born generations; however, immigrants’ children—the second generation—are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population. Estimates of the long-run fiscal impact of immigrants and their descendants would likely be more positive if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.

http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf

Using data from the Current Population Survey, this paper describes the effect of the Marie1 Boatlift of 1980 on the Miami labor market. The Marie1 immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Marie1 influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier.





https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/



Research does not find a significant impact of overall immigration on unemployment in the UK

Focusing on the period 1997-2005 when the UK experienced significant labour immigration (see our briefing ‘Migrants in the UK Labour Market‘), Dustmann, Frattini and Preston (2013) find that an increase in the number of migrants corresponding to 1% of the UK-born working-age population resulted in an increase in average wages of 0.1 to 0.3%. Another study, for the period 2000-2007, found that a 1% increase in the share of migrants in the UK’s working-age population lowers the average wage by 0.3% (Reed and Latorre 2009). These studies, which relate to different time periods, thus reach opposing conclusions but they agree that the effects of immigration on averages wages are relatively small.

One of the key features of propaganda is not merely bias, but disinformation.

&gt; information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view

The video piece is obviously incredibly biased, and possibly even offensive to some, but it's not really making any false assertions of fact is it? It's not like the video is suggesting we can give the NHS an additional £350 million per week or something like that. Which would be a good example of propaganda, rather than satire.

As I say, it's tricky, and I'm not a fan of this video as it happens, despite it being funny, clever, and well performed. It's vitriol level is a little high for me.

Edit: I'll add, after a little thought, I'm not sure I'd argue my point strongly. I'm not a fan of grotesque caricature as political satire. Perhaps this is just simple propaganda, despite being for ""my side"".

134,"&gt;Unless the population and businesses are paying the progressive bill. I'm very much hearing you, my point is that first, restoring progressiveness allows to decrease taxes on the middle classes without significantly touching national tax revenue. And then you may want to lower taxes further while keeping a nice (and real, not pretend) progressive curve, but as I've been trying to show you it comes at a very real cost that can be counter productive even to the middle class.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another problem is that the trend since the 90s has been the opposite, to cut tax on the right side of the curve, making it move towards a flat line, i.e. a degressive trend. This trend cost quite a lot in public services already, yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I just do not think there is that much tax revenue in wealthy people that you could tax enough to make up for all the taxes the middle class pays. If you really slashed middle class taxes, (like slashed the payroll tax and VAT by a lot), then you would need to have a much, much, much, larger tax on income at the wealthier end to make up for that enormous drop. I don't think that's possible while keeping revenue neutral. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There's retirement in there. If you don't pay for it this way, you still  pay for it. The US middle class pays to private companies what it  doesn't pay in taxes. Mandatory spending to private actors, I usually  call that the private tax. It is *not*  low in the US, it is very low in France. We think it's wiser to keep it  that way because we have more direct control over government than we do  over businesses, and because only the State has a duty to account for  the general interest. If citizens have to depend on something, it better  be something that depends on them than something almost orthogonal. And  so trading public tax for private tax is not interesting.

Wait what? There is retirement in US Payroll taxes too and the benefits are not minuscule, it's like $1,200/month on average. And payroll taxes in the US are only like 15% of gross wages instead of 50% in France. 

&amp;#x200B;

You aren't taking into account the fact that the US has faster economic growth than France precisely because taxes are lower. When you pay for something yourself, you still have an incentive to work as much as possible. When your taxation has to be excessively high to pay for those things, that excessively high taxation itself can harm growth by discouraging the after-tax income of workers. What's the point of investing in a new business, starting a company, or working more if you just have to pay super high taxes? The high taxation itself discourages growth and output. No such disincentive to starting a new business works  when you aren't taxed as much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that ***you think its wise*** . We know that, I'm pointing out why it's not wise because government can just regulate businesses however it wants anyway without the government needing to tax everything to the hilt to pay for everything itself and disincentivizing labor and capital investment.

Sorlin is the leader of the ultra-right organization Dies Irae (“Doomsday”), a member of the French National Front party, the former head of the France-Europe-Russia Association, the head of the Katehon analytical center (whose supervisory board includes the well-known ideologue of the ""Russian world"", Alexander Dugin, and this the structure is under the patronage and funding of the Russian GRU).

Moreau participated in the so-called ""elections"" in the occupied territory of Donbas as an ""international observer."" He lives and works in Moscow. He is also the author of the book ""Ukraine. Why France deceives itself.""

325,"&gt;To cut taxes on the middle class, which is fair, France can make  effective taxes more progressive too, without needing to cut national  tax revenue

No they can't because you are not looking at how taxes are paid in France. You are just looking at **income taxes,** but a tremendous amount of tax revenue is raised in France through extremely high **payroll taxes** on the middle class (and all workers) and also **high VAT taxes** on consumption. Payroll taxes have the exact same effect as income taxes, they're just paid by your employer on your behalf and you don't see it. If France wanted to meaningfully reduce the tax burden on the middle class they would **need to slash both payroll taxes and VAT** which **would create an enormous deficit in tax collection.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But effective taxes for the very rich used to be 60-80% in the US and UK from 1930 to 1980, with spikes up to 95%

&amp;#x200B;

Hahaha. Not they weren't. I'm an American tax lawyer. Nobody ever paid rates those high back then because there were a ton of tax shelter strategies allowed. There was never an **effective** tax rate anywhere near that for anyone. All those tax shelter were closed down in the 1970s and especially 1980s when they reduced rates. The effective tax rate have not ever changed that dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**I believe in progressive taxation**. America has extremely progressive taxation for those same reasons you are discussing, nobody wants to tax the middle class. **That's why we have much lower payroll taxes , lower sales taxes, and more progressive tax brackets**. But the only way to ever raise as much revenue as France wants to raise is to tax the middle class out of their ears. The US government doesn't collect nearly as much tax revenue as France does because the US doesn't want to tax the middle class. But the US doesn't spend nearly as much government spending as France does.",,/r/europe/comments/a4lovs/yellow_vest_protests_economic_catastrophe_for/ebghngt/,sandyhands2,1544394177

329,"&gt; Right back at you. It's so close that it's laughable you laughed at me bringing it up. I'm sure if you told people in the 70's what the EU turns into they would laugh at you too. Now we're all laughing. Even if you were right and it was far away, it's still coming. Better to leave now than later if that's the case. Political union, monetary union, talks of a fiscal union with common tax policies and a shared ""EU Army"", ability to fine members for not following legislation, it has it's own elections and it's own parliament and elects a president intended to represent all 28 nation states.. if that's what so far away feels like I'd hate to see how much closer we could get before you agree that this union is pretty damn close..

I'm glad you got a chuckle but it's a simple fact that the EU is far from a federation. And a large number of countries simply don't want it. Saying it's heading that way isn't based in reality. The tax policy has yet again been shelves for example because so many countries were against it. There are areas of coordination and areas of independence.


&gt; 
&gt; I'd say it's a lot closer and down the middle than you think.. Brexit has created a whole new generation of EU nationalists inside Europe. I don't have a problem with people wanting a strong federal government in Europe. I just don't agree with them.

That's not what the opinion polls say


&gt; I see you too are looking forward to the eventual rise of the second Holy Roman Empire.

This is the basic problem with everything you are saying. You take something based in reality and stretch it until it's meaningless and then take issue with that version of reality. I said the EU would be around in some form, coordinated trade and policies within Europe. Because if it completely disintegrates it's a sign things have gone horribly wrong and like you said, we're all fucked.

It wasn't just Himmler who was anti-Christian. Many high-ranking nazis were anti-christian, seeking to destroy or replace the protestant and catholic churches and replacing them with a nationalsocialist religion called 'positive christianity'. The hardcore wing of the nazis even had a term for those who rejected christianity, but still maintained faith in a higher being. They were called 'Gottglaubig'. The nazis tried to fight a 'kirchenkampf' against the churches.

&gt;The Nazis co-opted the term [Gleichschaltung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung) (coordination) to mean conformity and subservience to the National Socialist German Workers' Party line: ""there was to be no law but Hitler, and ultimately no god but Hitler"".[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchenkampf#cite_note-20)  
&gt;  
&gt;[Nazi ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_ideology) conflicted with traditional Christian beliefs in various respects - Nazis criticized Christian notions of ""meekness and guilt"" on the basis that they ""repressed the violent instincts necessary to prevent inferior races from dominating Aryans"".[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchenkampf#cite_note-21) Aggressive anti-Church radicals like [Joseph Goebbels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels) and [Martin Bormann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bormann) saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchenkampf#cite_note-Ian_Kershaw_p.381-382-22) East Prussian Party [*Gauleiter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauleiter) [Erich Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Koch) on the other hand, said that Nazism ""had to develop from a basic Prussian-Protestant attitude and from Luther's unfinished Reformation"".[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchenkampf#cite_note-23) Hitler himself disdained Christianity:[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchenkampf#cite_note-Hitler_p218-24)

There was surely division between the party regarding religion. But the Nazi elite still wanted to destroy Christianity. And in the end, the nazi elite would've decided Europe's future if they won the war.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchenkampf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchenkampf)

More intresting lecture; regarding this new nationalsocialist Christianity they wanted to establish:

&gt;Dr Zoellner and \[Catholic Bishop of Munster\] [Count Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_von_Galen) have tried to make clear to me that Christianity consists in faith in Christ as the son of God. That makes me laugh... No, Christianity is not dependent upon the [Apostle's Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle%27s_Creed)... True Christianity is represented by the party, and the German people are now called by the party and especially the Fuehrer to a real Christianity... the Fuehrer is the herald of a new revelation.""— [Hans Kerrl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kerrl), Nazi Minister for Church Affairs, 1937

During the war [Alfred Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Rosenberg) formulated a thirty-point program for the [National Reich Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reich_Church), which included:

* The National Reich Church claims exclusive right and control over all Churches.
* The National Church is determined to exterminate foreign Christian faiths imported into Germany in the ill-omened year 800.
* The National Church demands immediate cessation of the publishing and dissemination of the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible).
* The National Church will clear away from its altars all [Crucifixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifix), Bibles, and pictures of [Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint).
* On the altars there must be nothing but ""[Mein Kampf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf)"" and to the left of the altar a sword.[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-51)

When exploring the Nazi party's public speeches and writings, Steigmann-Gall notes that they can provide insight into their ""untempered"" ideas.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-52)

&gt;We are no theologians, no representatives of the teaching profession in this sense, put forth no theology. But we claim one thing for ourselves: that we place the great fundamental idea of Christianity in the center of our ideology \[Ideenwelt\]- the hero and sufferer Christ himself stands in the center.""[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-53)— Hans Schemm, Nazi Gauleiter

Prior to the Reichstag vote for the [Enabling Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act) under which Hitler gained the ""temporary"" dictatorial powers with which he went on to permanently dismantle the [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic), Hitler promised the Reichstag on 23 March 1933, that he would not interfere with the rights of the churches. However, with power secured in Germany, Hitler quickly broke this promise.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-54)[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-55) Various historians have written that the goal of the Nazi [*Kirchenkampf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchenkampf) (Church Struggle) entailed not only ideological struggle, but ultimately the eradication of the Churches.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-Controversial_Concordats-56)[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-a4-57)[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-books.google.com-58)[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-Mosse_p._240-59)[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-Germany:_a_modern_history-60)[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-Wheaton,_Eliot_Barculo_p._290,_363-61)[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-org.law.rutgers.edu-62)[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-63)[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-64)[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-65) However, leading Nazis varied in the importance they attached to the Church Struggle.

460,"&gt;So what you're saying is that you think the recent policies and reforms introduced by Macron can't be enough to warrant the protests of this scale? Because your post really just mentioned GDP and GINI which don't really relate to them.

Why are you saying this when I just wrote:
&gt; My argument was not at all meant to be ""Gini-index seems fine, why dont you relax monsieur?"". It was just what seemed to be a reasonable starting point for the discussion. More like ""something is obviously wrong and it doesnt seem to be the most obvious macro trends, so what is it?"".

Did you even read what I wrote?

&gt;1.) French people love to protest and it appears as it has now spiraled into protesting just for the sake of it. The fact that even after Macron backtracked on the reforms, protests got even larger and wilder, it should give you an idea of what's actually happening. I'm pretty sure this isn't about actual policies anymore.
Sure but its about something and although I know France has a history of demonstrations I dont want to believe that they are attacking the police just because its tradition.

&gt;2.) Macron is still a president of the rich. The French voted mainly for him to prevent LePen so I could imagine a lot of them saw him as the lesser of two evils. Protests are bound to happen after an election like that. Not to mention that still a huge percentage is backing LePen who is obviously inciting the protests as well.

Yes this is probably an important part of the story. But it also links somewhat to your first comment. Hollande wasnt very popular either. Sarkozy I guess was ""less bad"" in the eyes of the French, but he wasnt really loved. It really be just about France only having incompetent presidents..?

&gt;There might be more to it which I'm not aware of it, I was simply calling out your reference of the indices which don't really give a good overview of what's actually happening. There are far better indices for welfare btw, GDP PPP is a questionable method of measuring it.

519,"&gt;Thou, I don't speak German so I can only use google translate. But it is evident that she was supporting him even before last elections, together with Putin, even Spegel new it was wrong move    

Hmm that's true but I was expecting something much bigger. Some other users have made it almost as if Merkel is propping Vucic. Statements like this one are pretty standard diplomacy, especially for Germany which has spoken well even of Putin and Erdogan. And until Russia became straight up hostile Putin got Western congrats on his election wins as well. Serbia is much less authoritarian and friendlier than Russia    so it would deserve at least that level of diplomatic politeness.     

&gt;On top of that, Vucic came to power just after German companies bought Serbian's major news outlets and banks.    

Wait wasn't Vucic in control of those media outlets. If he's doing it by German proxy that would be very damnable. Though Germany is a free economy and the government doesn't bear responsibility for what companies do abroad. So it would have to be a German state linked media takeover.     

&gt;Also the time when our currency stopped being currency and started being Euro called ""dinar"" (2012): https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=EUR&amp;to=RSD&amp;view=10Y, that is even more obvious just after elections in April 2017.      

That's just common sense, Serbia does most of its trade with the EU. Most non-euro European currencies maintain a peg to the euro. Even Switzerland did it too, but had to brake it recently because of too much demand for their franc.       

&gt;On EU chapters, we don't really want to be part of EU, not after we saw all the hate towards Greece in 2014, so blocking ""chapters"" is seen as friendly move even when in comes from Croatia.   

I don't think you have an objective view on Greece-EU relations. This just sounds ridiculous. Nobody hates Greece. And for all the annoyance with them EU countries have sacrifaced a lot to help them. Greek pensions were higher than even German ones but still Germany and other EZ countries supported Greece financially. Yeah they were grumpy for having to do that but still did it. Honestly this is a pretty good metaphor for a family member helping you through your crazy spending spree while complaining of your poor choices.

575,"Well, ignoring the loaded part of that question...

It's not just about referendums. While yes, the population should have the right to override and abolish any government edict with a referendum, that is not sufficient. Consider the following - a republic is commonly understood as a government with elected leaders. In the Holy Roman Empire, nobles and the clergy used to elect the Emperor, but that doesn't mean the Empire was a republic, does it? A similar relationship exists between referendums and direct democracy. Referendums are nothing but a tool, and have been frequently misused by dictatorial governments, and even liberal governments, to further their agenda. 

We ought to replace competitive politics based on parties with cooperative politics based on sortition - random selection of citizen volunteers. Here's how I see it working...

Legislatures would be composed of ordinary people, serving relatively brief (I think 5 years is suitably long, but I am not sure), but staggered terms (meaning only a fraction of the legislature is renewed every year). But you wouldn't just take someone and put them in the legislature right away, you would make the selection a year in advance, and then during the said year the incoming citizen-legislators would attend sessions of the legislature to learn the ropes and you could even pair them up with current members so they could learn even faster.

Furthermore, much political discord in modern representative systems comes from their centralized, top-down character. An ideal government is, in my opinion, a federation of federations, with an inalienable right of secession guaranteed at all levels. A nation would be a federation of regions, and each region would be a federation of municipalities. The national legislature, as well as regional ones, would be bicameral, with the first chamber being like the body I described in the previous paragraph, and the second being composed of delegates sent from the legislatures of the previous levels (ie. national second chamber is composed of regional delegates and regional second chamber of municipal delegates). Delegates in second chambers would be under imperative mandate and as such nothing more than ambassadors of their regions/municipalities. This would ensure that each level maintains firm control over the next level.

624,"&gt;Liberalism is the mockery of the unfortunate. It proclaims marvellous rights: 
freedom of thought, freedom to propagate ideas, freedom of work... But these rights are mere luxuries for the favoured ones of fortune. The poor,, in a Liberal regime, may not be bludgeoned into working; but they are starved out. The isolated workman, possessed of every sort of right on paper, has to choose between dying of starvation and accepting the terms the capitalist offers him, however hard they may be. Under the Liberal system the cruel irony could be seen of men and women working themselves to skeletons, twelve hours a day, for a miserable wage, and yet being assured by the law that they were ""free"" men and women. 

&gt;Capital... is an economic instrument which must serve the entire economy, 
and hence may not be an instrument for the advantage and privilege of the few who have had the good luck to get in first. 

&gt;... we will take down the economic ma-chine of capitalist ownership which 
swallows all the profits, and replace it by individual ownership, family ownership, 
common ownership and syndical ownership. 

&gt;Finally, the Liberal State carne to involve us in economic slavery, for the workers 
were told, with tragic sarcasm: ""You are free to work as you wish; no-one can compel you to accept these conditions or those; very well then, as we are the rich, we offer you the conditions we think fit; you, as free citizens, are not obliged to accept them if you do not want to; but you, as poor citizens, if you do not accept the conditions that we impose upon you, will die of starvation, surrounded by the greatest degree of Liberal dignity.""

627,"&gt; When the leaders you’ve elected to make those changes go against what you wanted, what do you do?

Mainly two options: first and most effective, don't vote on them next elections. Secondly, if there is absolutely no politician who does what you want them to do, you can enter politics yourself, although it's very unlikely that this would be necessary. However, Macron is doing exactly what he promised what he would do, so I don't think this point is viable.

&gt; When the media is downplaying the peaceful protests and making it out to be a small scale disagreement, what do you do?

I doubt this was the case, and this shouldn't be a problem in a country with freedom of press. Again, in the extremely unlikely case that absolutely no media are covering what you want how you want it, you can start your own news medium outlet.

&gt; When the well runs dry and you protest peacefully , yet you still get arrested, the media still ignore the struggle, and your president refuses to open a dialogue; what would you do?

Again, as far as I know no one got arrested / prosecuted for peaceful protesting, if you can point out an example I'd be more than happy to look at it.

655,"&gt; The seizure by Russian forces of three Ukrainian vessels and their crews in the Kerch Strait at the entrance to the Sea of Azov has turned a harsh spotlight on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which embodies the contradictions of German foreign policy at a time of rising geopolitical tension.

&gt; The pipeline begins under the Baltic Sea, comes onshore in Germany, bypassing Ukraine and Poland, and ends at the Austrian border. It is being built by the Kremlin-backed gas group Gazprom, and co-financed by a consortium of German, French, Anglo-Dutch, and Austrian oil and gas companies. But politically it is fully owned by Berlin. As such, it is a test of whether Germany is willing and able to live up to its claim to be a responsible leader in Europe.

&gt; Nord Stream 2 has been contentious since its inception in 2015 because it will deprive Ukraine of most of the estimated $2bn it earns annually in gas transit fees. It is opposed by the US, while most of eastern Europe is also against it. Concern has also been expressed by France, the UK, Sweden, and Canada, and last month lawmakers in the German and European parliaments signed a letter to Angela Merkel asking her to stop the pipeline.

&gt; Over the past week, all three candidates to replace Ms Merkel as leader of her Christian Democratic party spoke out against the pipeline, as have senior Social Democrats and Greens. The chancellor herself championed Ukraine’s right to seek alignment with Europe a few days ago, while Heiko Maas, her foreign minister, has taken pains to distance himself from the SPD’s tradition of equidistance between the west and Moscow. The Kremlin, meanwhile, roundly rejected Berlin’s attempt to mediate.

&gt; All of which invites the question: why is the German government still defending Nord Stream 2?

&gt; Some of the criticism, it should be noted, is exaggerated or biased. US President Donald Trump’s claim that Germany is “captive” because it imports 51 per cent of its natural gas from Russia is simply wrong. It is holding together a fragile European sanctions consensus, and investing in Ukraine’s transformation. Also, the US wants to sell liquefied natural gas to Europe, and Poland wants to be part of the deal.

&gt; Still, for Germany’s economics minister, Peter Altmaier, to insist that Nord Stream 2 can be made a “win-win” for all suggests that Berlin has yet to grasp just how profoundly it (and Europe) is affected by the global shift to great power competition. Its reluctance is understandable: no other country on the continent has gained as much stability, prosperity and power from global interdependence and the democratic transformation of its neighbours as Germany.

&gt; Today, Russia and China are backing autocrats and weaponising inter­dependence — in trade, infrastructure, and cyber space — against the west. Gazprom’s pipelines to Europe were recently decried as of doubtful commercial value by Russian experts. But geopolitically, they are hugely useful tools of control and coercion.

&gt; Berlin’s options for wriggling out of a trap of its own making are few. Reversing permits on national security grounds would mean incurring punitive damages. Ms Merkel has noted that Germany could also play the coercion game by curbing gas inflows. But that would still leave Ukraine at the Kremlin’s mercy.

&gt; Two choices remain. Berlin could submit to US sanctions. Or it could stop blocking the European Commission’s efforts to apply EU competition rules. Both are unpleasant. But consider the alternative. A finished Nord Stream 2, by circumventing Ukraine, removes Kiev’s most powerful deterrent against further aggression by Moscow. It fatally undermines European cohesion, and Germany’s credibility as a trustworthy neighbour. That would be a very high price to pay.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/a4m3zt/nord_stream_2_is_a_trap_of_germanys_own_making/ebfnfyd/,idigporkfat,1544372813

&gt;For ""display your life"" purposes on Facebook by the wider public, we're talking about private photos, for which you still need consent to publish (like posting on Facebook) in theory, but in practice this is mostly dealt with by just having common sense (i.e., a feel for how people in your photo feel about it because you know them well, and that you ask when in doubt -- it's your risk, because they could sue you).

In practice it gets really complicated. Because by uploading your photos to facebook - you are transferring all (non exclusive) rights for the photo to facebook, which use the photo for commercial purpose (they display the photos alongside with advertisement - which is enough in Germany to be considered commercial use). Most people don't know and don't care. And police will no persecute you without someone complaining, because there is not enough ""public interest"", but it does not change the law, that it's illegal to take pictures of strangers without their consent in most cases.

I can't speak for France and I'm guessing that most of the people outside of France can't either, but as far as labour/pro-worker movements go, I have yet to see **any** quantifiable progress in the century+ that they have been around.

Sure, you can point to worker benefits, leave allowments etc. but these aren't 'progress', they're giving a worker the absolute bare-minimum that they should be entitled to.

With that in-mind, who's going to listen? Who is going to look at this group of under-represented workers and say ""we should grant them the policies they want, which will hinder the ruling class""? Do you think that will happen, genuinely?

C. NATO, Finland joining NATO is a bigger deal than sweden joining NATO. There is no way norway or denmark would leave NATO so any union would have to be a NATO member.

D. Capital city, leaving finland out makes copenhagen the natural capital (it is too far from finland)

alternatively we can make Oslo the capital and effectively have sweden/denmark join norway so that norway-EU relations are extended to sweden and denmark and we don't have two brexit ordeals to deal with",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/a4htg7/as_a_norwegian_i_wish_the_kalmar_union_would_be/ebf9gsy/,GargleMayonnaise_,1544358270

It's much easier to rally support when you simply everything down to nonsene and offer quick broken solutions.

1377,"&gt;The democratic system in France is a two term vote, it's pretty good but it's not perfect, and two of it's perks are the ""sanction vote"" and the ""barrage vote"".

Great. People absolutely have a right to be stupid.

&gt;This was at first made specifically for De Gaulle, but now there is no more 2 perfectly sided parties with huge leaders, we have MANY parties and no big charismatic and inspirated leader. So people don't vote for their favorite, but their least worst choice.

Yes, this is how it works in most countries. That's how you get the best compromise.

&gt;Maybe you guys don't like it, but this is how we work.

My only problem is that this riot mentality prevents the country from functioning. It prevents the government of making reforms. It prevents fixing problems because someone is always going to riot. And europe really cannot afford a stagnant france.

&gt;Sometimes it works, someone has to take the first step. I m against violence and stone throwing and car burning, but i understand that they do it.

I don't. They are destroying the foundations of their country. They are building the next sick man of europe.

&gt;And no, it's not ""like everywhere else"", taxe in Finland are 45% of the wage on average, it's more than 56% in France. And our Public services don't work anymore, police, nurses, doctors, soldiers, 

The total tax burden is 56% in france, 54% in belgium and austria and 52% in germany. Not that big a difference. In finland it's 46%. You want to cut taxes? Have you estimated how it would affect the budget?

No, not random lawyers. Damn good lawyers. You have no idea who bar associations and the legal profession works. Read the Uniform Commercial Code.

You think that industry is dontating money for private legal associations to draft uniform organ donation statutes? You think that the state legislators don’t know what’s in these laws themselves before they vote on them?

1466,"&gt;If Finland regaining it's old borders is genocide, I wonder what bombing of Dresden or Tokyo were. Fuck off.

Note, you also disagree with this statement, in this comment you specifically point out how Finland expanded beyond earlier borders.

&gt;the Finns mostly stayed at the pre-Winter War border at the Karelian Isthmus (with small exceptions to straighten the frontline),

Mostly. 

Finlands pre-war borders are as follows

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Finnish_areas_ceded_in_1940.png

Reclaiming borders... like the Soviet Union reclaiming Russian empire borders? I pressume you apply former border justifies action rule with the Soviet Unions invasion of Poland and Finland? Right... I mean it was the former border of the Russian Empire so I guess that's okay.

Finland attacked the Soviet Union in cooperation with Nazi Germany to reclaim borders lost in the Winter War. During this war Finland cooperated with the Nazi's, deported Jews, sieged the city of Leningrad with the Nazi's who had and was actively carrying out a mass genocide as part of Lebensraum who long before the siege took full effect the brutality specifically of SS division was known with mass executions in Poland. 

Finland was sieging Leningrad from receiving supply, support, food from deeper in the Soviet Union. This was done to reclaim earlier borders. 

Guess what Germany also 'reclaimed' earlier borders in Poland but that doesn't justify the mass execution of Poles does it?

OPEC is done.  If they want to choke supply, we'll increase production or bring new wells online.  If the price goes down, that's good for business.

1625,"&gt;One thing that has never developed in the US has been a forum for  creating opt-in standards/legislation across states, and I think that  some things have unnecessarily gone to federal level or never been  standardized because of that.  I wish that the US had such a thing, as  it would avoid controversy over states being forced into legislation  that they don't like, but still make the default to be standardized.   Might be that the EU would benefit from a similar structure even more.

Do you actually live in the US? These things happen literally all the time. What do you think the Uniform Commercial Code is? The US has multiple forums to negotiate and standardize state legislation concerning everything from contract law and state tax law to organ donation law.

&amp;#x200B;

These forums, aren't run by the federal government. They're run by private groups of lawyers like the Multi-State Tax Commission or the Uniform Law Commission that draft what they think are ideal Uniform Acts and then they shop those acts out to state legislators. The state legislators then make a few changes if they want and then pass them as normal state laws.

&amp;#x200B;

Example: § 2-403 of the Uniform Commercial Code covers ""Power to Transfer;  Good Faith Purchase of Goods;  ""Entrusting"" When you look at the Mississippi or Virginia version of the UCC then §2-403 covers the exact same thing. The states do this on purposes because it would be literally impossible for lawyers to work in this country if we had to learn 50 separate systems to do things.

&amp;#x200B;

The state governments legislate on a shit tons of things in the US. The federal governments in the US passes way fewer laws than it needs to because lots of times the states get together and do it themselves.

&gt;I don't know much about CAP, but it seems to me that if it has a  justification, it is assisting states with a small-farm economy do a  politically-acceptable transition away from it.  Tie the subsidy to  workers of already at least some given age who have already been in the  farming industry continuously, so that it doesn't subsidize new people  entering the field.  That'll keep that group happy and simultaneously  move towards a phaseout of CAP as it achieves the economic transition.

&amp;#x200B;

The justification for the CAP is the same as the justification for any agricultural subsidies, even like the ones that we have in the US. They don't care about benefiting small farmers so much as just keeping farming in business. Small farmers have weak economies of scale and aren't nearly as productive as big producers. The CAP benefits large farmers (and landowners) because they want to keep food production higher so they don't have to import massive amounts of food from the large producers like the US where all farms are much larger and produce way more food.",,/r/europe/comments/a45agh/how_would_you_reform_the_eu/ebdmpa2/,sandyhands2,1544300698

Under the new institutional agreement, Switzerland can refuse following these rule changes, but under the institutional agreement the EU can then take (proportional) measures to protect the single market.

I believe the new treaty would actually be a net plus for Switzerland, since a(n enforcable) rule of proportionality actually protects the weaker party more than the stronger one. Currently, there is no dispute resolution mechanism, so if one side takes arbitrary unilateral measures, then the other side can not really do anything except retaliating with unilateral countermeasures, too. But in such a game, the law of the strongest rules.

You can talk all you like about people like this being pussys, fact is a good number of them aren't and really want a islamist fuck to come for them. They want an excuse to fight them, and kill them in self-defense.

Only a handful were fat rednecks, but that doesn't necessarily mean they weren't capable.

I even recall one video (not hosted on youtube I'm fairly certain) where the guy, a vet who specifically stated he had his best friend killed on patrol in Afghanistan, pissed on the Quran, rubbed raw pork on various pages while cursing Mohammed, and then burned it, then stated his name and city. This was around 2008. Not sure what happened to him. Probably nothing much to be honest. A lot of these terrorist types are not that courageous themselves. It's easy to strap bombs on under clothing and go blow yourself up, or to sit way back with a sniper rifle and take pot shots at women and children or soldiers on patrol; not so much to stalk someone for weeks, try to kill them, and hope you don't get caught in the act or killed before you do anything.

Or it can stop attending the meetings where chapters are closed and open. Or its parliament can simply say "" We're done, goodbye"".     

Likewise if Serbia wants to join it has all the power to do so. After giving it candidate status the EU surrendered most control of the situation to Serbia.

1790,"&gt;Labour generates wealth using capital, capital gets the lions share and labour gets to survive.

&gt;Capitalists are only needed because they accumulated wealth, and they have only accumulated wealth by hoarding the lions share of the wealth workers generate.

Vast majority of income generated in France goes to labour, not capital. Incomes in France are not something I would consider 'just surviving'.

&gt;Anyway my point in this particular discussion is not about that. It's about how labour should also be treated well, not only capital. Because if capital is discontent, it can leave without any cost, while most labour does not have that flexibility. Capitalists can invest in any country they want from the confort of their couch or needlessly luxurious car. Not so with those who actually do the work.

1806,"The Koch/Soros-out-to-get-me nuttery in pop US politics goes way back, though, pre-Obama — Soros donates to left-wing political stuff, Koch to right.  They're both elderly businessmen who made it big back when — Soros in finance, the Koch brothers in industry.  I'm pretty sure that people really like the idea that their side is right and it's only one guy standing in their way, so it became *quite* popular to attribute influence to them wildly out of any proportion to their actual role.

From what I've seen from Soros via interviews and stuff he's funded, dude has pretty reasonable arguments.  One of the things that the Koch Brothers partially funded was the [Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/), which is one of my favorite think tanks — one economist there wrote up the best critique of the effects of Proposition 13 (a somewhat unusual California property tax law that passed decades back that has some unusual effects on California's economy) that I've seen.  A lot of what they do is fund academic types to do studies.  Neither runs around doing the inane D-R partisan shitflinging, and both keep their output pretty polite.  In fact, frankly, if the Democrats in general sounded more like Soros and the Republicans more like Koch, I'd be *delighted*, as the level of political discussion in the US would be considerably better.

EDIT: The Prop 13 analysis is probably irrelevant to most people here, but an example of something newer and more germane from Cato is [The Ideal U.S.-U.K. Free Trade Agreement: A Free Trader’s Perspective](https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/ideal-us-uk-free-trade-agreement-free-traders-perspective), which argued for what any US-UK FTA should contain.

as an EU citizen you are absolutely free to settle down in whichever EU country you please

as an EU citizen you don't need any work permit or anything else - just come to Germany to live, study, work or just doing nothing, if you dispose of living resources

thus, feel free to enter Germany with your Canadian (?) pass and begin working with your company, by virtue of your Romanian citizenship

after 3 months in Germany you may acknowledge the authorities (not ask, just acknowledge) that you - as an EU citizen - decided to stay in Germany; they will issue all documents you're entitled to

in order to do so, you should travel to Bucharest as soon as settled down in Germany and apply for the renewal of your Romanian passport; don't apply for a Romanian ID, it's much too complicated for you to obtain, since you don't intend to live in Romania; a passport will be OK for you

with the Romanian passport you're entitled to live and work anywhere in the EU, as you already know; you may show this Romanian document to the German authorities, when you decide to announce your long stay in Germany

there are no bureaucratic hurdles for you as a Romanian in Germany

1907,"&gt; So the muslim world doesn't have to reinvent the wheel. Europe did that 150 years ago. We can just give them the wheel (like when Europe forced the ME to abolish slavery). They just don't want it unless forced to. 

Yes, but we can't say they haven't started the process. And you seem to forget the western world itself, is not completely ""clean"".

Abortion still wasn't legal except in specific cases in ireland up until this year. Italy still has blasphemy laws.

Overall I don't think all the muslim countries ar that far behind. Saudi arabia is legalizing women driving vehicles and overall we see progress in most countries that are at peace.

&amp;#x200B;

Also progress always require a minimum of time, because you need some of the older and stubborn generation to just die. It's sad but that's just the truth. Death and the passing of time, is the only thing that prevents a society from completely stagnating in terms of society. Even in western countries, go to any small village and you'll see the difference with more modern mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is basically it although historically flawed since most of the muslim world was under ottoman imperialism, not european. So they can't even blame europe on that front.

... until the end of WWI

After that europe and the usa (mostly) very heavily influenced most of the countries.

And you can't deny that since 9/11 mostly there is a global feeling that muslms are terrorists and/or fanatic people. I don't think it really helps the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The way I see it, they just don't want to ""adjust"" to european standards since it implies that their way of life is wrong. And how could a thousand year of tradition and much more importantly, Muhammad (who Gabriel spoke directly to) be wrong?

Do you think ""they"" are just one entity? Ot that they all agree about that?

You hear about one muslim that stabs a guy that insults his prophet and suddenly forget all the ones that didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I honestly don't care what they do in their own countries. Want to lock up apostates and gays? Fine. Just don't try to excuse it and say it as it is - they think apostasy and homosexuality is a criminal offence.

There is no excuse for that behavior. Just an explanayion without moral judgement, for why there are more cases of violent reactions to blasphemy.

I don't wish anything else but to explain to people that islam, isn't a religion inherently different from others. It's not more violent, more invasive, less moral or respectful of human life etc... Whatever happens is more the result of a social context and less about what is written in the qur'an. Coming froma country that had a civil war because of religon,  I feel sad that in western countries there is this growing idea than muslims are just a bad community and they have to be fought, contained, or kicked out as a whole.",,/r/europe/comments/a48e9l/man_who_stabbed_irish_lecturer_66_to_death/ebcu5cl/,jack_in_the_b0x,1544278886

1916,"&gt;Tech Giants Wake Up to EU Copyright Plan **That Threatens to Nuke the Web**

Can you have a more biased title, damn...

&gt;YouTube, Reddit, and Twitch have recently come out publicly against the EU’s new Copyright Directive, arguing that the impending legislation could be devastating to their businesses, their users, and the internet at large.

Two of these already have automatic filters without it fucking up their business. Youtube is even in talks with the EU to push for this stuff, since they already have Content ID. Don't trust Google.

&gt;Unfortunately, the way it’s designed will likely make it more difficult for smaller platforms, harm the free exchange information, **kill memes**, make fair use more difficult to navigate

Oh, fuck off with this meme bullshit again. Fair use is not a concept in the EU. Free exchange of information is not harmed. Maybe your videos get a bit more boring if you can't use copyrighted content, but that does not harm your ability to share information. Small companies will not automatically fall under the rules, because the article starts with:

&gt;Information society service providers **that store and provide to the public access to large amounts of works or other subject-matter uploaded by their users**

So if your business is not in that, you can just move on. If your company is small, you can just move on. The only thing we need here is an actual objective measurement of what large amounts are.

&gt;So far, this issue hasn’t received the kind of attention that, say, net neutrality did

Where has this dude been over the past months if he thinks this?

&gt;Article 11, better known as a “link tax,” would require online platforms to purchase a license to link out to other sites or quotes from articles. That’s the part that threatens the free spread of information.

Holy damn, the biased title of the source they link:

&gt;The EU's Link Tax will be voted on in TWO DAYS: if passed, **you won't be able to link to the news** except on Big Tech's licensed platforms

That is not at all what is going on. The misinformation is baffling. The actual text:

&gt;Member States shall provide publishers of press publications with the rights provided for in Article 2 and Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/29/EC for the digital use of their press publications.

Then this:

&gt;Article 13 dictates that online platforms install some sort of monitoring system that lets copyright holders upload their work for automatic detection. If something sneaks by the system’s filters, the platform could face full penalties for copyright infringement.

No, it does not. Let's have a look:

&gt;shall, in cooperation with rightholders, **take measures** to ensure the functioning of agreements concluded with rightholders for the use of their works or other subject-matter or to prevent the availability on their services of works or other subject-matter identified by rightholders through the cooperation with the service providers. **Those measures,** such as the use of effective content recognition technologies, **shall be appropriate and proportionate.**

Where does it say a single video going by a filter (which is an option, not a requirement, you are free to use another system if it fits your platform) gets you a fine? It does not.

&gt;The content filters would presumably resemble YouTube’s Content ID system, which the company has spent tens of millions of dollars to develop and it still does a terrible job

Wow, tens of millions (!!) of dollars, what a huge amount! Alphabet makes billions a quarter, if they wanted a better system they can pay for it easily. If they care so much about this all, they can even make it open source to help those smaller companies they seem so worried about.

&gt;Algorithms are just very limited in what they can do well, right now.

Funny, just a short while ago Google and Facebook were promising everything about fake news and hate speech on their platforms would be fixed by magical algorithms. Now they can't identify a song or movie properly with an algorithm? It's almost like they are full of shit and lying through their teeth about everything.

&gt;Wojcicki specifically pointed out that Article 13 threatens the livelihood of people who upload content.

Funny, this is the same person that later on turns around and is lobbying in favor of these things:

&gt;Now, however, Reda is warning YouTubers against taking YouTube’s stance as their own, **noting that its CEO has been in Strasbourg lobbying in favor of upload filters and is only interested in avoiding legal liability**.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://torrentfreak.com/article-13-youtube-ceo-is-now-lobbying-for-upload-filters-181115/](https://torrentfreak.com/article-13-youtube-ceo-is-now-lobbying-for-upload-filters-181115/)

Again, don't trust Google. They don't give a shit about you. They now suddenly care about their users on Youtube, while they refuse to even implement simple systems like setting side advertising revenue when a video is falsely flagged and return it to the video maker after it is cleared up? Of course not.

The text should be more clear. But the misinformation article like this spread is not helping anyone, neither is taking over the lines of massive corporations like this.

1991,"The irony is lost on you isn't it, well I'm just gonna dismiss your claim of a militarized border since

&gt;You made a claim but won't show any evidence to support that claim. 

Oh and having read the GFA 


&gt;It's blatantly obvious you haven't read the GFA

And you can say Irish you know

Anyway first it is important to understand what is the good Friday agreement. The GFA signed in 1998 is what finally ended the troubles, it brought a framework for peace and is the basis of how NI works. What does it contain? Very basically it defined everything from sovereignty, justice,power sharing, policing, civil rights and of course the dissolution of paramilitaries. It was signed as an international treaty as well as a multi-party agreement. It was approved by referendum on both sides of the border. Now how does a hard border threaten the GFA? First of all the agreement defined something quite interesting it allowed NI to be both Irish and British at the same time people born there can have access to both nationalities as well as institutions to allow cross boarder cooperation. A very important thing to understand about the GFA is that the spirit of the agreement is as important as what is written, some parts of the agreement are quite vague to allow flexibility to make it easier to be accepted. Now what is hard border? That is a very subjective term but here I'll take it as border checks and crossings. The thing is although never explicitly stated the GFA was kind of based on the idea that both nations were in the EU it is based on sharing,co-operation and inter-dependence a hard border would destroy all that, it would be seen as tearing the GFA not just by irish Catholics but everyone in NI. NI is still rife with division culturally, ideologically,etc a hard border would be like dropping a lighter in a barrel of petrol. There is a reason why the people of NI voted to remain, they don't want a repeat of the troubles only extremists on both sides are excited at this prospect. It is a very complex treaty maintained by a status quo. The GFA agreement brought peace to a troubled land, the DUP and Sinn Fein have maintained, even though there were tensions, a power sharing structure for a decade something that was previously unthinkable and a hard border would be throwing that agreement to the toilet, no-one is disillusioned about it, look at what some of the chief negotiators of the agreement are saying.",,/r/europe/comments/a44h90/they_know_the_history_of_the_famine_sinn_fein/ebcuorv/,Axnot,1544279455

Because the EU dislikes the current setup of the bilateral treaties, the Union has frozen any negotiations on new treaties as long as there is no agreement on this dynamic updating of the bilateral treaties.

employment. While contributing to GDP, these workers are not taken into consideration as part of the resident population which
is used to calculate GDP per capita.

See for yourself : [Article 12](http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/langues/welcome-to-the-english-website-of-the-french-national-assembly#Title2).


tl;dr : yes, can disolve the lower house of the Parliament and call new elections.

Done by De Gaulle in 1968, Mitterrand in 1981 and 1988, and Chirac in 1997.

Macron has the support of a tailor-made absolute majority in the National Assembly : he has strictly no interest in calling new elections that would most certainly result in a cabinet hostile to him. Or, he could try and emulate Chirac, who did so in 1997 and was reelected in 2002.

He can also resign, which would of course lead to a new presidential election, and most likely in new legislative elections.

He can also call a referendum.

I'm just saying that if someone feels so strongly that their policies are sensible, I don't *per se* object to you having a chance to prove it.  That way:

* They *immediately* get what they want, along with anyone else who feels strongly enough.  Sure, they may have to move (though theoretically you'd choose the portion of France most in favor of this), but if it's such an overriding concern for them, that shouldn't be so bad.

* They will have a higher-than-normal proportion of people committed to the success of their plan.

* They have the opportunity to show that their desired policy works well, and in doing so, obtain powerful evidence to shift the rest of France to it.

And that way, if I'm right and the various demands do not add up to a sensible economic policy, then they've a safe fallback and France as a whole suffers only limited losses.

I mean, I don't think that this is sensible just for a gas tax alone, but for the broader list of issues that people have been complaining over.

In my opinion, this is what the movement should say: 

The rich need to pay more taxes, corporations must bear more responsiblity for their actions, tax evasion and scheming must be stopped. The earnings gained from this must be used to maintain the existing welfare programs and other public spending, and to alleviate the impact of the emission taxes on the poor and middle class.

2435,"Reglions just *happen* to work like that, but in reality, most religions should be followed literally by the book if one really wanted to be part of one religion. Many have it in their credo to practice what is being written in X book/teachings. The majority of the common populace, let's say for Christianity, hasn't even read the Bible or even just the New Testament. The priests in the Churches just pick one piece with a positive message they can sell to people and that's about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So they follow the image of a ""god"" they don't understand and don't care about looking into it further by themselves. So religions change because they're just not truthful, if things were true every sort of information that would come from one religion would have to meet a set of conditions that include (and doesn't stop there) of being unchangeable, absolute and apparent, nothing would need to be changed by anyone because it would not be possible.

&amp;#x200B;

So coming back to:

&gt;I don't understand why people always put such emphasis on that.

is because those who partake in them without following the teachings and just believe to a couple of things can't really be called exactly of that specific denomination, nor should they claim to. Religion is essentially a commitment, if they don't care then why even bother.

The voters *never* wanted to join a new pseudostate. But the usual elite politicians never gave a shit about what anyone wanted.

No, that is the opposite of ethnic, that is called linguistic. 

Researchers track the migrations of people throughout time by looking at certain genetic markers associated with that group. I think they know how to do their job. 

Look eupedia .com/europe/Haplogroup_R1a_Y-DNA.shtml

&gt;R1a-M458, primarily a Slavic subclade, with maximum frequencies in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, but is also fairly common in southeast Ukraine and northwest Russia.

&gt;its subclade R1a-L260 is clearly West Slavic, with a peak of frequency in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and radiating at lower frequencies into East Germany, East Austria, Slovenia and Hungary.

&gt;R1a-Z280 is also an Balto-Slavic marker, found all over central and Eastern Europe (except in the Balkans), with a western limit running from East Germany to Switzerland and Northeast Italy. It can be divided in many clusters: East Slavic, Baltic, Pomeranian, Polish, Carpathian, East-Alpine, Czechoslovak, and so on.

.

&gt;R1a is present in both Scandinavians and South Asians.

I am aware, thank you for reminding me. I have seen the distribution graphs of these haplogroups many times. The presense of R1a in South Asians is the result of indo european people migratuing south east trough Iran all the way to India. Which is why farsi and hindi are related to european languages instead of Arabic or Turkic . This is backed up by genetic evidence such as this.

2584,"&gt; 5G is still in test phase

Not really. Rollout will begin next year for the pioneers and more will follow in 2020. Some countries are ahead of others. Not my problem that you live in a laggard country. 5G is imminent.

&gt; Most of the mobile operators still use data limits on mobile connections so LTE/5G can't really replace a cable connection for a household

I've used a data measurement tool for my day-to-day activities which logs all the incoming and outcoming data. I use between 50-75 GB per month over a 6 month period. 

I'm fairly certain that there will be offers in this range on 5G within not too many years. In fact, there are already 4G connections with over 1000 GB in data limit already (for instance in Denmark). However, this still has a lot of latency. 5G will fix that.

&gt; You have to biuld a denser grid (e.g. in street lights).

I am aware of this. But as someone living in a large urban area, it doesn't concern me as much. I think the rural countryside can probably benefit from LTE-advanced 4G. If I had my way, all wired internet would be fiber and where that wouldn't be possible and/or profitable, then using either 4G/5G as a replacement would be better than doing ADSL and other garbage.

&gt;Clearly that people certainly means more than one but in no way does it necessitate a majority. Come on man, stop grasping at straws.

I'm not using it to disprove you, I just didn't understand you really intended with ""people"". Clarification isn't ""grasping at straws""

&gt;Ah so you agree that culture is relevant to politics, well then there is no problem, I never said it was the focus I only said it was relevant which you seemed to argue with but apparently you agree - so you agree that to discuss the politics of Europe in some sense involves the culture of Europe.... great!

Yes?! But it doesn't mean positive interest like you were saying.

&gt;You can’t even tell me what his generalisation is.. I’ve asked you and you’ve no idea, so I don’t know how you could assume that it is a right generalisation. It’s a false equivalence to compare a genralisation that can be analysed to one that you don’t even know the basic details of.

Is English your second language? I can't read minds that's why I said ""maybe"", it could be, there is a possibility.

&gt;And they’re salary would increase, it’s in the article I linked!

Maybe, but they have to get there in the first place and many other factors when they get there. ""Can't afford to move""

&gt;So HDI isn’t everything? Well that’s great because all I ever said was that for some people HDI isn’t everything, which is part of the reason why they prefer Europe over Canada. Culture, surroundings, family not measured in HDI.

I've said 70/30 for a while now...IT IS A FACTOR SOME SOME PEOPLE, a small minority of people, from my experience.

&gt;I feel as though you are consistently missing the point, I said that for people, some people, living in Europe is better than living in Canada because HDI isn’t everything. You’ve essentially agreed to that three times - there is no argument, you’ve agreed to what I said!

&gt;As Ive said and you’ve ignored, people value culture and history as well, ‘better’ has never been simply a matter of HDI.

You are saying everybody considers culture a little, a small but noticeable amount when moving. Which I disagreed with, people don't consider culture from my experience.

&gt;You on the other hand made a flat out statement that people don’t care about culture, there was no qualification, no awareness that some people do, simply a flat statement that you travel a lot -and people don’t care!

That wasn't your argument, but sorry about the slip-up, it was a mistake that was misleading. Pointing that out isn't grasping, it's clarification.

2679,"Well, the problem is that the public transport is bad, really bad. They have really nice buses, everything is modern, clean, generally the buses are empty.

However:

* almost everything follows a radial model where the buses go through the city center; you need to go from neighborhood A to neighborhood B, 1.5km away? strap on for a trip from your neighborhood to the city center, then for another trip from the city center to that neighborhood; if you're lucky and the connection is short, you'll probably get there in 25 minutes; if you're averagely lucky, you'll miss the connection because your bus is late and you'll get there in 40 minutes; if you're really unlucky you'll miss your connection and the next bus will also be late, therefore getting to your destination in 1 hour (for a 1.5km trip)

* their model is based on average or big buses, many of them articulated - these buses are not agile and have a hard time on the narrow streets of Luxembourg; more than that, at peak time the main ones are full but most of them are almost empty 80% of the time; however, because cost of labor is very high in Luxembourg, I assume they are slightly more economic than some sort of mini-vans; still, they kind of suck because their size means that their frequency can't be that high, the best one is bus 18 and even that passes at best every 7 minutes, everything else is 10 but generally every 20 or 30 minutes, so a connection missed is a big problem... especially since buses are unpredictably late

* public transport is really bad on Sundays or holidays, especially outside of the city of Luxembourg; 1 bus passes every 2-3-4 hours, 3-4 times a day, usually between 10:00 and 17:00, so any kind of nightlife is frozen...

* many narrow streets; a garbage truck, a school bus, someone driving slowly, a car crash, etc., the buses are completely blocked; in many parts of the city there are bus lanes, but it's like efficiency: it only takes 1 bad segment for the whole route to be delayed horribly",Romania,/r/europe/comments/a3siz8/luxembourg_just_made_public_transportation_free/ebbrhmg/,oblio-,1544229531

I think they will work, but it will be a long time before they integrate and are eligible to pursue a higher education in order to gain access to more sophisticated careers. Unemployment is already an issue in some countries, Spain especially. So the work that they provide might not be realized until after a couple of generations.

I think you're generally right about this. The problem needs to be addressed at the source in some manner or another.

2793,"&gt;Don't try to tell me that the passage to Europe gets safer without rescue boats. I don't believe that.

Smugglers are currently being subsidized by rescue boats, they don't have to invest in seaworthy boats because rescue boat operators pick up the tab for the journey. It doesn't make much sense to go on the boats if they are guaranteed to fail by design, with no one picking you up. I don't think it's going to be a smooth transition without some sort of informative effort targeting migrants to educate them about smugglers and boat safety. It becomes a lot safer if smugglers are no longer in the equation but I don't think that's realistic, the best we can do I think is mitigation without aiding smuggling efforts. One possibility would be to send the migrants back to the country from which they sailed, but this requires an understanding with the established governments operating there, which I don't think is so simple either, but seems to me to be the best short term solution. 

&gt;What's your next proposition? To abolish ambulance cars, fire alarms and locks because... I mean, there must have been accidents where ambulance cars were involved?

I never suggested this. 

&gt;Anyway, those rescue boats are history now. Which is a good thing from your POV. Because the ""dilemma of scarcity"" has gone. Tomorrow all over Europe hospitals will be built, there will be no more poor people or unemployment because the social contract has been saved. Good news, I can't wait for it!

First of all, the effect remains to be seen. We will see if the smugglers choose to keep sending out boats that aren't seaworthy.

Second of all, the dilemma of scarcity is never gone. That's the point. We are never going to be able to resolve the problem, at least not in our lifetime, just mitigate it.

&gt;Of course I would save my kid first.

Exactly. Because morally you understand that any parent not preferring their child over someone else's is morally in the wrong, this much we know as a people and you will seldom find someone who disagrees. Proximity and national identity are important in forging bonds with people that we live with, this cannot be ignored.

&gt;Does it mean I wouldn‘t care about other kids?

I never said that. I explicitly stated that you would care about your child more. Why ? 

&gt;And why can‘t I save both?

Because you don't live in a utopia with infinite resources and administrative capability, if you could we wouldn't be having this conversation, there would be no war, and everyone would be happy. These decisions are real life decisions that we have to contend with every day, hand waiving them away as easily solvable as ""saving both"" is not practical for this discussion.

If you were a morally bankrupt person you would. 

&gt;If my kid dies they all should die, too?

Why would you say that ? This wasn't part of the question. 

&gt;There is no choice here, no moral dilemma.

Whenever there is scarcity there is a moral dilemma. You are advocating for unbridled and unregulated import of economic migrants that will burden your social services at the expense of your fellow citizens. This is what those refugee boats are doing. This is not to say those people aren't welcome, but there is a vetting process in place that makes them accept a social contract that is part and parcel of becoming a citizen in a certain country. The entire idea of nationalized services rests on the presupposition that the people paying into those services will also be able to take advantage of those services. When you start making the system top heavy with more takers than providers, you are going to have to choose who gets what, again, scarcity.

&gt;Recent research conducted by Dr. Thomas P. Duffy of the Yale School of Medicine explored why certain people survived the Great Hunger, concluding that the answers probably lie in their gene pool.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to his findings, “levels of an essential factor in iron delivery are reduced in malnourished individuals. A further contribution to a negative iron balance among the Irish was their heavy consumption of tea. Tea contains tannins that complex with iron in the gut and inhibit its absorption.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr Duffy found that those without the gene would have died in disproportionately large numbers during the famine- since iron is one of the most critical elements within the body.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The Great Famine with its life-destroying absence of adequate nutrition magnified the importance of possession of the HFE gene for hemochromatosis. A concentration of individuals with the gene would occur among the survivors.”

So basically it was already relatively common (about 1 in 1000 is what i heard) but those with the gene were more likely to survive starvation so it became way more common during the Famine as people without it died especially in the west where all my family are from (west of Ireland is about 1 in 50 these days from what I've been told).

This was only 150 or so years ago and now I regularly have to go in to get ""bled"" where they basically take large amounts of my blood which makes me feel shit obviously. So does my brother and mother and my father is already dead from complications due to it. Proof enough for ya? Or would you like to see my medical records?

If they had a tax on trade surpluses that was given to the deficit countries and possibly some sort of mechanism that punished deficit countries that took on too much debt earlier on then it would encourage governments to enact policies to correct those imbalances before a crisis happens.

Because when Inés Arrimadas is insulted because she was born in Andalusia, and is told to go back to Cádiz, that doesn't reflect a mentality prevalent among many Catalonians. It's just a single crazy woman.

The subsidy that you refer to is given to many more regions ([1](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_de_Fomento_del_Empleo_Agrario), [2](https://elpais.com/ccaa/2013/04/21/andalucia/1366563501_930725.html)) as we're the biggest autonomy by population, second by land and most of our rural inhabitants work in the primary sector we get a bigger share. Makes sense to me.

But hey, can you guess who gets a subsidy from the EU too, for the people in rural areas that work in the primary sector? [Cataluña](https://ec.europa.eu/spain/barcelona/news/los-agricultores-catalanes-reciben-las-ayudas-de-la-pol%C3%ADtica-agraria-com%C3%BAn-para-el-2016_es).

Do you know what region has a higher deficit than Andalusia (-1.054.341,49€)? [Cataluña (-1.104.283,49€).](https://datosmacro.expansion.com/estado/presupuestos/espana-comunidades-autonomas)

[And Catalonia receives a bigger subsidy than Andalusia for the automobile industry](https://sevilla.abc.es/20100524/nacional-andalucia-actualidad/cataluna-recibe-ayudas-automovil-201005240152.html). Like way bigger. 87% more.

2995,"&gt;This is enabling the entire operation. It's like these charities are paying for half the trip. Or half the costs of the smuggler. 

yes no, it is not like this. Because from NGOs' point of view (and mine), refuse to rescue someone's life in danger is not a viable option to ""teach a lesson"". Or better: a human life is more valuable than borders, deals, the opportunity to go on vacation instead of volunteering on a rescue ship, which is everything but a walk in the countryside.

On the other side: the very existence of human smugglers is because the migrants can not buy a plane ticket but have to rely on illegal ways to move. This is also because the process to get a working/tourist visa is highly arbitrary and un-adapt to manage the current situation. So technically the countries are enabling the entire operation, by not allowing safe legal routes for migration (and, on the other hands, take advantages - together with multinationals interested in the resources of resource-rich countries - of the countries of origin of many migrants).",,/r/europe/comments/a3ycc6/aquarius_the_last_mediterranean_refugee_rescue/ebb0d6o/,zborro,1544207690

I am also not quite sure how many voters will be able to really identify AKK as very closely linked to Merkel. Her more conservative social views might serve to differentiate her enough from Merkel in voters' mind.

This is simply not true. A process has been agreed whereby the backstop can be exited.

&gt; Imagine for a moment that Scotland voted for and got independence, but as part of that they had to allow the UK to unilaterally dictate the customs policies of the bits near the English border forever. You'd be screaming bloody murder about imperialism and rightly so.

I can't believe I have to point this out **again** but no-one is stopping the UK, NI included, from leaving the EU. Your comparison simply is not valid. The backstop is designed to ensure that Britain meets its obligations as set out several times over the past 18 months and to smooth transition between exit and a comprehensive FTA.

ahah, incredible how stiff and bigoted you zealots are and yet you are blissfully ignorant of the history you claim to defend.

St Thomas Aquinas is *not just any* saint. He is a doctor of the church, a title that only a handful of saints in the two millennia of the catholic church have been bestowed.

In essence, doctors of the church are saints that have deeply shaped the history and teaching of the church through their works and thought, from St Jerome, the saint that translated the bible into the canonical Latin version, to St Ambrose and St Thomas Aquinas, the latter being the most important theologian of the late Middle Ages and the the Scholasticism, i.e. the Aristotelian inspired school of theology that shaped the medieval church.

sound very heavily biased but as I said I don't know as much as I would need. Do you mean the forming of the new senate in 1917 where Social Democrats were under-represented? Nevertheless, as far as I've read the civil war was instigated by the Red side, to which the whites (not yet officially formed under Mannerheim) formed smaller civil guard regiments. There was still no army in the country (well, apart from the Russian) and the white parliament had to flee Helsinki when violent Reds took to the streets in an effort to seize power, after which the red lantern was lit in the Worker's House (or was this earlier?).

Anything beyond ""T"" is obviously not even going to be recognized as existing until the T issue is discussed, because the demands of every subsequent letter just get more extreme, and I do not feel comfortable with a societal system that says ""Every set amount of time, we must push the boundary further"" - it gives a feeling that every compromise is little more than a cease-fire, and that the progressives will never be satisfied, or never stop.

3197,"It's a bit more complicated than that.

It was independent from settlement (874) to 1262. At that point it voluntarily became part of the Norwegian kingdom. The Norwegian throne was inherited by the Danish monarch in 1380 and then all of Scandinavia became united in the Kalmar Union. After the Kalmar Union broke apart in 1523 Iceland was still a part of Norway, but Norway was in a union with Denmark, referred to as Denmark-Norway. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark%E2%80%93Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark%E2%80%93Norway)

After the Napoleonic wars in 1814 Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden, but kept Norway´s overseas territories of Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Norway objected to this but was defeated by a Swedish invasion.

Shortly after, the Icelandic independence movement began, and it was entirely based on the fact that the covenant between Iceland and Norway from 1262 was now broken and therefore Denmark had no right to rule Iceland. The Icelandic parliament was officially re-established in 1843 and Iceland was granted home rule in 1874, and a few decades later full sovereignty.

So, for most of its history Iceland was a part of Norway, though *de facto* controlled by Denmark, but as I said previously Danish rule over Iceland was very distant and limited in influence. At any rate, saying we are Danish doesn't make sense since we are ethnically, culturally, linguistically, genetically and historically distinct from Danes. If we were still a part of Denmark we would be considered an ethnic minority just as the Faroese and Greenlanders are today.

Regarding the language, you are right that there was a struggle to remove Danish influence in the 19th century, but you have completely reversed the facts of the matter. The language spoken in Iceland was always Icelandic, Danish influence was only present in a tiny restricted minority of Reykjavík elites who were educated in Copenhagen, and eliminating those habits was swift, easy and entirely successful. You can easily look this up.

3270,"Yes, but it's one matter to know ""computer can calculate it, when I give the numbers"". Another to know ""these are the parts the ballistic equation is made of and this is the physics involved"", which is opportunistic situations allows for some adaptive employment of methods. To account for the unexpected. To add level of adaptability and confidence. If something feels of the people have enough knowledge base to know ""Is this really off or I'm i just ignorant. How can I verify this? Is it me, the gear or the math that is messing up."".

And actually: No or more not necessarily. For example FDF batteries and artillery command post still maintain slide rules, geometric correction rulers and other manual tools combined with just plain ballistic tables. Still work on flat map on table and grid paper to mark out locations of targets and fire units and use simple geometric measures to figure out firing solutions.

Computer can run out of electricity, computer can be hacked, computer can be taken out by EMP, computer can malfunction.

Two pieces of plastic, wood or metal hinged together in various geometric arrangements with grids and curves marked on them will work no matter what as long as there is someone to use them.There is not much to go wrong in a simple rotating or sliding mechanical joint of a slide rule or geometric ruler.

FDF atleast assumes enemy will not play fair and will use every trick in the book allowed or not allowed to take out technology. Forward observers have literally millimiter grid papers and rulers to figure out target coordinates from observed compass direction and distance. Heck I would not be surprised, if in some prepardness storage there still isn't the age old parallax range finders. Though laser range finders are the standard issue now.

So that when we go to sticks and stones fighting, we have sticks with optics lenses in them and stoned are packed in a metal tube with gunpowder to go boom.

to be a heinous sell out, as our national military contracting company Patria puts it: *when if is not an option*

On the other hand we have developed probably the worlds most modern command radio network and C&amp;C suite and are deploying it out putting a combat information terminal on the hand of every company, platoon and even squad leader. However it is still assumed even that one of the most robust and redundancy planned C&amp;C net will collapse or be partly unavailable atleast locally in real war. So the combat couriers are still in employ, FO still carry plain binoculars and compass, work on paper and gun command crews have slide rules and measure to manually figure out the firing values. Because you newer trust technology completely. 

What technology can do is make the process faster, when available. But in the end it goes to manual mechanical methods and guerrilla style fighting.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/a3oudz/helsinki_just_opened_a_new_central_library_to/eba7xlk/,variaati0,1544185786

3272,"&gt; 2) It kind of proves the point that the modern citizens of Turkey aren't real Turks (Found in the center, Hazara, Uygur, Uzbek), but people that were forcefully Turkified and brain-washed to consider themselves Turks.

The Turks are between Middle Easterners and Central Asians. Which implies that there was a genetic impact of Turkics (which ranges around 10% to 40%, larger than the Greek genetic impact which is not even around 2%). Besides Turkmenistan isn't on this PCA. So no need to make any guesses. Besides ""forced Turkification"" myth debunks itself here, because there's a shift. But not so sure about Hellenization. Greek genetic impact isn't even 2%, yet people thought they were Greeks.

Also, Hazaras aren't Turkic. And Uyghurs had nothing to do with Seljuks. Seljuks were Turkmens. Way more MENA shifted than the peoples I listed. [Here's a more detailed PCA plot](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QL7j8Rd_Gc8/W1xE9CZ-DiI/AAAAAAAAAhM/BpK4hf8qNGsEJ-ro6vcMnwBYski-H8S6ACLcBGAs/s1600/pca.png)

By the way, if we were ever interested in forcing everyone to be Turk, you'd not be here. 

&gt;3) South Italy was called ""Magna Grecia"" because it was inhabited by Greek colonies before the Latin Roman empire conquered them. Amazing how there is still a connection, after 2800 years of colonization. :D

The problem is that normal people don’t understand the kinds of money that governments have at their service so £350 million seems like a lot and the fact that people see it like that shows how disconnected the British public are from the EU.

The UK should pay more because its GNI contribution is higher as is a significanty bigger and more prosperous member than nearly every other members. Therefore has the ability to pay more so it isn’t really fair on the other members to have to foot the UK’s tax bill. The UK also pays less per head than many of the other members, with Luxembourg and the Netherlands paying the most. In any union, you have countries that subsidies the other members, like in the USA, places like New York and California help subsides poorer states like Mississippi and West Virgina.

3355,"Article text:

Cabinet ministers and Brexiteers have seized on the papers, obtained by The Times, as they believe their contents could let Theresa May put pressure on Ireland to drop the “backstop”.

The papers say the UK leaving the EU without a deal would cause a 7 per cent drop in GDP for Ireland, compared to a 5 per cent drop in Britain. This is because Ireland is “a more open economy than the UK, accounting for 60 per cent of GDP comprised of goods imports and exports, as opposed to 40 per cent for Great Britain”.

Ireland is also more dependent on the UK than the other way round, with Britain accounting for 13.1 per cent of Irish exports and 29.1 per cent of imports, the papers say.

Some 80 per cent of Irish road freight that reaches the EU passes through the UK. Any additional checks at the border — even one way from Great Britain into Ireland — “would cause challenges”, according to the assessment. It adds that “political and social damage would likely follow”.

The papers specify that trade in perishable goods, such as food supplies, would be particularly badly affected. Priti Patel, the former cabinet minister, said: “This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario. Why hasn’t this point been pressed home during the negotiations? There is still time to go back to Brussels and get a better deal.”

Lisa Nandy, a Labour MP, said: “Threatening Ireland in this way is as morally reprehensible as it is futile. Britain should be showing itself to be a dependable neighbour and friend in the future, and it is frightening that Brexiteers are even contemplating a move which could see stopping trade, including food supplies, being weaponised in this way, particularly given the uncomfortable historical echoes.”

A senior Irish government source said that a deal on the withdrawal agreement had already been reached between the EU taskforce and the British government, which included a backstop for the Irish border.

“That will not be changing, under any circumstances,” the source said.

Another Irish government source said that contingency planning for a hard Brexit had been under way for most of this year.

“We are prepared if there is a no-deal scenario next March. We also have a commitment from the European Commission to support Ireland against the fallout from a hard Brexit.”",,/r/europe/comments/a3yoiw/warning_of_food_shortages_in_ireland_no_deal/eba3a8b/,madhooer,1544178342

3610,"I think people are less familiar to the concept in arms sales. But I think the US does it way more often than other countries because of the volume of US arms exports.

&amp;#x200B;

Like around 4,500 F-16 fighter planes have been produced by the US. Without a no resale provision, when the US tries to sell new F-16s the US would have to compete on price against other countries trying to sell off used F-16s that they already bought from the US years ago. There's thousands of F-16s in the world, so the US would essentially be competing against itself to an extent. Especially since lots of countries buying the F-35 will be trying to sell their old F-16s (which is exactly what Israel is doing here). Trump is super pissed off at Israel over ths because not only are they trying to violate the contract, but the US gives Israel lots of military aid anyway so they can't really complain about being strong-armed morally.

&amp;#x200B;

But like, when Sweden or France try to sell a Gripen or Rafale, they don't need to worry about competing against themselves because there's only like 60 Gripens in service outside of Sweden or 10 Rafales in service outside of France, so they don't need to worry about canibalizing their own export market since there's no real supply of used Gripens/Rafales for sale anyway. I would imagine that France/Sweden don't even have the leverage to negotiate a ""no resale"" contract when they try to sell their planes because they want to export as many planes as possible anyway and a no resale clause would make their bids less attractive at a time when they're just trying to get their first foreign sales made.",,/r/europe/comments/a3rof3/us_blocking_israelcroatia_arms_deal/eb9o57g/,sandyhands2,1544156896

It’s fine, it’s your experience, but none of what you have to say based experience is cold cold hard fact when extrapolated to large populations - that shouldn’t be debatable. My claim was that some, not most, not the majority, do, which is a lot easier to prove - go into r/IWantOut and read a few of the posts, many will talk about European culture, type ‘Why I moved to Italy’ or Spain or England into google and read one of the articles, many will mention European culture - that’s proof that some which was all I ever claimed, value culture. You claimed that the majority don’t, and that’s harder to prove, and you haven’t managed to do it either! The claims aren’t the same and what is required to make a convincing argument for those claims isn’t the same either - you seem to be missing that...

Many on the sub are talking about work and education not culture...

&gt;No. I didn’t.

&gt;For God’s sake, yes people I.e. more than one person, some people, I quite literally spelled it out for you here ‘I’d say the majority don’t but many do’ - don’t equate what I said with what you said, you’ve a far harder task, you have to prove that the majority feel that way, I don’t! Some people feel that way isn’t hard to prove at all.

Then say ""some"" the first time, please.

&gt;Are you telling me that Russian politics isn’t a product of Russian culture? That Irish politics doesn’t involve being aware of Irish culture? That British politics doesn’t involve being aware of British culture? There are literally degrees at Oxbridge that focus on the relationship between culture and politics and you have the ignorance to say that... And your job involves being aware of politics? Ah come on, who hired you? You’re not required to know about politics at all are you... This is ridiculous now.

Why would awareness of that mean anything, there is a difference between me liking Spanish culture and wanting to visit/live in Barcelona to me knowing French people protest a lot historically so this isn't uncommon but not being entrenched in French culture.

Awareness of something =/= liking it or having abnormal interest in it. lol

3679,"I said *some* and there are many, here’s an example;

&gt; I've been thinking of making this move for awhile as I've always loved Europe when I’ve travelled there 

Fair to assume that he isn’t exactly leavng for the HDI, after all, he’s American and they have a higher HDI than several EU nations!

&gt; Then say ""some"" the first time, please.

It isn’t *my* fault that *you* read what you wanted into one comment and conveniently ignored others, after all, if you’re arguing that I said or implied *majority* when I actually said *some* you should probably make sure that it is accurate to say that I said *majority*... which it isn’t, because I didn’t! What are you, five?

&gt; Why would awareness of that mean anything

No no, do not try deflect, you argued that culture is irrelevant to politics, quite literally you wrote; ‘Politics doesn't focus on culture’. Now I never said that the primary focus of politics is cultural (although in many ways it is, it structures society and society is cultural) I said that an awareness of culture is necessary - why? For this reason, culture informs politics - you don’t have to be interested in Notre Dame to understand French politics but you do need to understand French culture, so you see, culture is an important aspect of politics. An interest in a nation’s politics to the degree that you, as someone that apparently has to be informed on politics, must possess, requires an understanding of the cultural and historical aspect of that nation. Why is France a democracy? Well, that is largely due to the French Revolution and the culture of that revolution - the revolution was buoyed by ideas that were undeniably cultural, nationalism and egalitarianism for example, that had an impact on the very political system of France today - that political system which you are interested in. And yes, awareness does generally equal interest; ‘concern about and well-informed interest in a particular situation or development’.

&gt; I don't know what he realised but it's possible is my point, people's opinion change(i.e Russian/American example).

They do indeed, you’ve already agreed that his opinion is probably founded on a poor generalisation so... 

&gt; Latin Americans live in low-HDI countries, does that mean they want to? No, it could mean they aren't able to move.

Ah but we are talking about one nation with freedom of movement, anyone can go anywhere if they want to...but they don’t. Why? Because there are other considerations; family, friends, maybe they like the county lifestyle, maybe they find the city intimidating, none of these by the way are included in your infallible HDI.... maybe, maybe it is a little fallible eh? The average income in Hudspeth County, Texas is over $26,000, the average income in Nye County, Nevada is over $41,000, the average income in Knox County, Kentucky is over $26,000 - these are some of the most rural counties and yet these people aren’t below the poverty threshold, they can afford to move, they’d probably do better if they did what with HDI and all that; but they don’t move, why? Because it isn’t all about HDI! People value other things believe it or not. And if truth be told we’re are learning that a lot of Latin Americans in low HDI countries are moving, walking thousands of miles to do so.",,/r/europe/comments/a3crsr/antivax_by_country/eb9r8vy/,newcount22,1544159772

3729,"&gt; Compelling, except that it isn’t really is it? It’s a bit like Donald Trump saying that most of the best people, most of the people that he knows, support him - you have to question it just a little bit! It’s a little...one sided. The point stands, only difference is it sounds marginally less Trumpian - perhaps Trump in a humble mood?

Don't know why you make this relation, I'm just speaking my experience. To quantify it I'd say it's 70/30, with 70% not carrying about culture from my experience. I'd say it's enough to make a slight generalisation since the ""survey pool"" is quite big.

Your claim of people caring about culture has no good basis either.


&gt;I never said I did, in fact I never claimed to even speak for a majority - that was your claim, not mine. You’ve already said that not all people feel that way, that affirmed my claim... which was that some do.

You implied it.

You said: ""Believe it or not, provided the difference isn’t particularly large, people do care about culture - and Canada well... it has a great HDI score.""

""people""

&gt;https://www.google.ie/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/six-charts-that-illustrate-the-divide-between-rural-and-urban-america-72934

&gt;Yeah, HDI isn’t exactly fantastic in rural America, people aren’t staying there because the HDI is great!

This site doesn't parrot your conclusion though, they could stay there from poverty alone. It's hard to move when you are poor in the first place.

&gt;It could be anything. What do you think the most likely reason is? If we posted the question on r/AskEurope, do you suppose work would be the answer? Even if it is solely an interest in European politics, guess what, that’s a part of European culture and history too! Political policies and divides do not exist in a vacuum. 

Just because I'm interested in Trump and Putin doesn't mean I'm into Russian or American culture lol. Politics doesn't focus on culture, history it does. Although that doesn't mean anything either.

&gt;I was only ever responding to him, to his post history, to his viewpoint, for some reason you’ve taken that argument up and all of a sudden he’s irrelevant - it’s the whole reason this conversation started. Right, those are probably pretty poor arguments though, don’t you think? I mean, if you’re generalising 500 million people because of what 500 hundred have said on a website you’re probably a bit odd, a bit mental - oh, I feel like I’ve said that before...

Serbia is shit and it's only getting worse and worse each year. We have the same people in politics since 90s. Opposition is fragmented and keeps getting weaker. There are too many irregularities with every election. We have a dictator who decides about everything. The worst thing is that he's enjoying Western support - because he's constantly working against Serbia's interests. We're never going to enter EU and that's the fact that majority of people are already aware of. We're not making any meaningful progress. I'm often called overtly pessimistic but IMHO the hope is lost. This week the government (indirectly) bought two televisions with national frequency. That means you will soon see government propaganda 24/7 on every national channel. North Korea level of population control. Government already controls almost all media in the country, and those who are still opposition-oriented are reached only by a tiny number of audience. Majority of voters (old people) still use TV and newspaper to get information and you can only see government propaganda in those. Voting for diaspora is made extremely difficult because they all vote for opposition parties, so it's not in government's interest to make it easier for them to vote. Therefore I think all hope is lost that this country is ever going to become a functional democracy.

3783,"I have lived in South and North Germany and this is exactly how Germans are and they hate to acknowledge that. They say they are just ""direct"" (which is the typical obnoxious people answer every where in the globe, not only Germans).

But not only Germans. People beleave on what they want to believe. Like the ""American Dream"" and the ""no racism in Brasil"". So many people come to Germany with a believes and admiration that blocks their mind about what it really is, as they do when go to Brasil, America, etc.

The ones who are not obnoxious are a small minority. In general Germans have social phobia, so they shut their minds and senses about others around in order to go through the day.

My daily experience in Germany:

- People not respecting queues. They always jump in front of you when a new counter is open in stores, when getting in public transport, in any situation.
- People are loud.
- People don't blow their nose when full, so they are constantly sniffing and coughing up phlegm, often without covering their mouth. In the public transport there is always a loud  sniff and coughing symphony.
- People stare at strangers with a creepy look, as if they were in a TV screen.
- They smoke bisides people and in front of doors showing no care about making others passively smoking.
- They don't respect others personal space when walking or standing among others. So they are often poking others with their bags, shoulders as if people around were inanimate objects.
- They don't know how politely tell people that they want they to leave. Instead of say ""thank you. See you next time than"" they say an abrupt ""bye"" in an anxious tone out of the blue with a hard look watching you desapear.
- They stand and block door ways and paths, even when the place is full, as if there were nobody trying to go through.
- When walking in the streets, people walk in front of others instead of wait others to go through.

Well, quite simply from the hundreds probably thousands of people I’ve met whilst travelling(I travel a lot). You overestimate how many people do not consider culture a factor when deciding where to live.

&gt; The mostly think, At the end of the day will living here be more beneficial/better

Yeah, believe it or not for a lot of people their surroundings actually are a consideration - it’s why many in the US and Canada decide to live in rural areas despite the fact that access to medical care, and amenities, and in fact salary also, are better in urban areas.

While it's true they've tried, in the past, the public has shot 100% of those efforts down. Because our government still answers to it's people.

&gt; It has been in support of free speech, and an unregulated internet in so far as it supports US interests. And again, we've seen that eroding for a while now

No we haven't, every battle has been won by the people and the free internet movements. That bad people haven't given up is not ""erosion"". Bad people never give up. It's not erosion until they start winning a series of fights, and so far they've only got a tiny little victory on Net Neutrality brought about by a poor choice of cabinet member by an inexperienced president. Which has been remedied.

&gt; The absence of that in the US (coupled with things like subsidies and local monopolies) isn't a good thing.

Like it or not, America believes the same positive results can be achieved with Free Market Capitalism and so far has been. High speed internet is incredibly cheap here, when compared to other cost of living expenses and average salaries.

&gt; Absolutely, and that's getting messier and messier as and when countries try to regulate and apply their laws internationally

Yes, I think we're in total agreement here.

In some parts of the world, sure. But not in America.

But in the same respect, we can't force those other nations to play by our rules.

I mean I've met hundreds probably thousands of people whilst travelling(I travel a lot). You overestimate how many people consider culture a factor when deciding where to live.

Where do you exactly get your information for this claim: ""Believe it or not, provided the difference isn’t particularly large, people do care about culture - and Canada well... it has a great HDI score.""

People wouldn't care if Italy has older architecture or unique cuisine/celebrations, etc. The mostly think, *At the end of the day will living here be more beneficial/better*

So what the fuck do I compare it to? Some fantasy you conjured up?

&gt;Sometimes you should crawl out from under the rock you live. Allthough maybe the ukranian nazis or russians will shoot you, so i understand you remain hidden

You're right that I haven't always lived a sheltered existence in a rich western country like your typical modern-day communist (all about those working-class people on the other side of the city). Hell, I've even lived under communism, which is one of the biggest reasons I now see it for the bogus murderous fantasy that it is. But your racist dig kind of missed the mark - exactly like yourself, I now live in a Western society and fully partake in all the perks that the advanced capitalism has created for me.

Save me some parsing, will you? Just quote to me what the proposed alternative is. Criticism is all well and good, but I'm asking for specific alternatives. How they're going to work, etc. That way there's something tangible to discuss and compare to, instead of just nebulous fantasies.

&gt;you don't want to go down that road, capitalism killed far more.

Even if you're born in Scotland you need 3 years continuous residency in Scotland prior to your course start date.

You can't be born in Scotland, move to England and live there until 18 and return to Scotland for free education. Similarly if you're born in England and move to Scotland as a kid, come the time you apply to uni, you'll get free tuition.

They constantly criticize America, putting it down, when in reality they are OBSESSED with us.

So the bottom 43% get no benefit. The next group are those who'd pay some, but not all of their fees back. They get partial benefit. This encompasses everyone earning up to an average of roughly £50k per year (assuming a 3 year degree) over the period. 

So, partial benefit goes to those from percentiles 44-96, with those earning more getting greater benefit from the abolition of fees.

4203,"CODE OF CONDUCT ON COUNTERING ILLEGAL HATE SPEECH ONLINE Facebook, Microsoft\* , Twitter and YouTube (hereinafter ""the IT Companies"") – also involved in the EU Internet Forum – share, together with other platforms and social media companies, a collective responsibility and pride in promoting and facilitating freedom of expression throughout the online world; The IT Companies also share the European Commission's and EU Member States' commitment to tackle illegal hate speech online. Illegal hate speech, as defined by the Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law and national laws transposing it, means all conduct publicly inciting to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. The IT Companies and the European Commission also stress the need to defend the right to freedom of expression, which, as the European Court of Human Rights has stated, “is applicable not only to ""information"" or ""ideas"" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population”. 1 Broader society and in particular civil society organisations (CSOs) also have a crucial role to play in the field of preventing the rise of hatred online, by developing counter-narratives promoting non-discrimination, tolerance and respect, including through awareness-raising activities. The IT Companies support the European Commission and EU Member States in the effort to respond to the challenge of ensuring that online platforms do not offer opportunities for illegal online hate speech to spread virally. The spread of illegal hate speech online not only negatively affects the groups or individuals that it targets, it also negatively impacts those who speak out for freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination in our open societies and has a chilling effect on the democratic discourse on online platforms. The Joint Statement issued by the extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs Council of 24 March 2016 on the terrorist attacks in Brussels underlines that ""the Commission will intensify work with IT companies, notably in the EU Internet Forum, to counter terrorist propaganda and to develop by June 2016 a code of conduct against hate speech online"". 2 In order to prevent the spread of illegal hate speech, it is essential to ensure that relevant national laws transposing the Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA are fully enforced by Member States in the online as well as the in the offline environment. While the effective application of provisions criminalising hate speech is dependent on a robust system of enforcement of criminal law sanctions against the individual perpetrators of hate speech, this work must be complemented with actions geared at ensuring that illegal hate speech online is expeditiously acted upon by online intermediaries and social media platforms, upon receipt of  a valid notification, in an appropriate time-frame. To be considered valid in this respect, a notification should not be insufficiently precise or inadequately substantiated. The IT Companies underline that the present code of conduct3 is aimed at guiding their own activities as well as sharing best practices with other internet companies, platforms and social media operators. The IT Companies, taking the lead on countering the spread of illegal hate speech online, have agreed with the European Commission on a code of conduct setting the following public commitments:  The IT Companies to have in place clear and effective processes to review notifications regarding illegal hate speech on their services so they can remove or disable access to such content. The IT companies to have in place Rules or Community Guidelines clarifying that they prohibit the promotion of incitement to violence and hateful conduct.  Upon receipt of a valid removal notification, the IT Companies to review such requests against their rules and community guidelines and where necessary national laws transposing the Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA, with dedicated teams reviewing requests.  The IT Companies to review the majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech in less than 24 hours and remove or disable access to such content, if necessary.  In addition to the above, the IT Companies to educate and raise awareness with their users about the types of content not permitted under their rules and community guidelines. The notification system could be used as a tool to do this.  The IT companies to provide information on the procedures for submitting notices, with a view to improving the speed and effectiveness of communication between the Member State authorities and the IT Companies, in particular on notifications and on disabling access to or removal of illegal hate speech online. The information is to be channelled through the national contact points designated by the IT companies and the Member States respectively. This would also enable Member States, and in particular their law enforcement agencies, to further familiarise themselves with the methods to recognise and notify the companies of illegal hate speech online.  The IT Companies to encourage the provision of notices and flagging of content that promotes incitement to violence and hateful conduct at scale by experts, particularly via partnerships with CSOs, by providing clear information on individual company Rules and Community Guidelines and rules on the reporting and notification processes. The IT Companies to endeavour to strengthen partnerships with CSOs by widening the geographical spread of such partnerships and, where appropriate, to provide support and  training to enable CSO partners to fulfil the role of a ""trusted reporter"" or equivalent, with due respect to the need of maintaining their independence and credibility.  The IT Companies rely on support from Member States and the European Commission to ensure access to a representative network of CSO partners and ""trusted reporters"" in all Member States to help provide high quality notices. IT Companies to make information about ""trusted reporters"" available on their websites.  The IT Companies to provide regular training to their staff on current societal developments and to exchange views on the potential for further improvement.  The IT Companies to intensify cooperation between themselves and other platforms and social media companies to enhance best practice sharing.  The IT Companies and the European Commission, recognising the value of independent counter speech against hateful rhetoric and prejudice, aim to continue their work in identifying and promoting independent counter-narratives, new ideas and initiatives and supporting educational programs that encourage critical thinking.  The IT Companies to intensify their work with CSOs to deliver best practice training on countering hateful rhetoric and prejudice and increase the scale of their proactive outreach to CSOs to help them deliver effective counter speech campaigns. The European Commission, in cooperation with Member States, to contribute to this endeavour by taking steps to map CSOs' specific needs and demands in this respect.  The European Commission in coordination with Member States to promote the adherence to the commitments set out in this code of conduct also to other relevant platforms and social media companies. The IT Companies and the European Commission agree to assess the public commitments in this code of conduct on a regular basis, including their impact. They also agree to further discuss how to promote transparency and encourage counter and alternative narratives. To this end, regular meetings will take place and a preliminary assessment will be reported to the High Level Group on Combating Racism, Xenophobia and all forms of intolerance ",,/r/europe/comments/a3pegu/code_of_conduct_on_countering_illegal_hate_speech/eb7yzja/,Tavirio,1544113324

The Romanians suffered a considerable setback when a staff car carrying attack plans accidentally drove into a German position and was captured. These plans were vital to the Germans, as they soon managed to push back the Romanian forces, leaving the way to the capital open.


The moment when you are trying to find the nearest bar but somehow drive into the enemy camp. Anyway, the title is wrong and based on op, ahem, nationality, I would say it was intentional. Romania continued to fight from Moldova and after the army was reorganised by a French General it managed to successfully hold the Central Powers back at many battles such as the one at Marasesti, until Russia left the war.

The original poster (OP) provided greentext descriptions of the images, explaining that passengers were constantly yelling “I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride.” After the coaster ended, the passengers walked down a large path leading to another entrance to the ride, where they were greeted by an installation of a skeleton with a top hat and a sign reading “The ride never ends.”

&gt;ARTICLE 122-5

&gt;A person is not criminally liable if, confronted with an unjustified attack upon himself or upon another, he performs at that moment an action compelled by the necessity of self-defence or the defence of another person, **except where the means of defence used are not proportionate to the seriousness of the attack.**

&gt;A person is not criminally liable if, to interrupt the commission of a felony or a misdemeanour against property, he performs an act of defence other than wilful murder, **where the act is strictly necessary for the intended objective the means used are proportionate to the gravity of the offence.**

It's explicitlly clear that the force must be approriate and proportional. The law does not justify beating anyone in order to give them a *""reminder""*.

I'm not defending the looters, but I am chastising the police for stepping out of bounds and using an unproportional amount of violence. They are supposed to be the embodiment of the law, and should act as such.

As a side note, it's impossible to avoid the possibility that police will not encounter someone and falsely believe them to be a perpetrator and then beat them.

As opposed to having fuck all to do with modern day Croatia? Anyway not sure who in his mind would claim that Serbs around the world and in region shouldn't see Serbia and Belgrade as their motherland (matica). Same thing is for Croats and Croatia, today and back in history. If it wasn't like that I doubt Ban Jelačić (born in today's Serbia) would have turn out to be greatest Croatian national hero. 




&gt;According to your logic you'd have to give up on Kornelije Kovač and Eva Ras because they're Hungarians.

But it wasn't my logic. I never said Croatia should give up on Tesla. Although comparing Tesla to famous Eva Ras who lived and worked whole her life on Serbian TV and theatre is false.

 Better example would be me claiming and boasting on Internet that Dua Lipa is famous Serbian singer. Which I would never do ofc. And also I wouldn't shit on Albanians for the same.

4503,"&gt; Well, generally it would take one for one though depending on both the size of the officer and the size of the rioter. Luckily the rioters were out-numbered more than 3 to one in the video.

Ok, now I am starting to think that you must be playing dumb. Anyway:

1. The number of people in the video does not matter, what matters is the number of rioters in the whole zone where the riots are happening.

2. Of course it does not take one for one to restrain rioters, but more than that. At least four to one, if you want to be able to restrain without using excessive force.

3. In addition to this, you are not taking into account what happens *after* the rioter has been restrained. Where is that rioter going to be taken? How exposed will the police officers who are moving rioters (to e.g. a police vans) be? Will they be able to accompany the rioters without getting hit by stones or molotov cocktails, since they will not be able to use shields properly while they do this? How many police officers must be checking on the restrained rioters? How many officers can you afford to remove from the group to check on those?

4675,"This post is not entirely correct. For once the directive includes more than a single article. Just a bit below that, in the directive, the following is specified

&gt;The measures taken by the online content sharing service providers should be without 
prejudice to the application of exceptions and limitations to copyright, including in particular 
those which guarantee the freedom of expression of users. For that purpose the service 
providers should put in place mechanisms allowing users to complain about the blocking or 
removal of uploaded content that could benefit from an exception or limitation to copyright. 
**Replies to the users’ complaints should be provided in a timely manner**. To make these 
mechanisms function, cooperation from rightholders is needed, in particular with regard to the 
assessment of the complaints submitted and justifications for the removal of users’ content. 

&gt;**Member States should remain free to put in place independent authorities for assessing the 
complaints submitted by users and making decisions on their validity. The redress mechanism 
should be without prejudice to the right of the parties to take action before a court.**

There is also a section that specifies how user generated content is excluded and, and that it affects only medium and large corporations sharing the links themselves (like Google News), not the users on reddit, for example.

From a [Wired](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-article-13-article-11-european-directive-on-copyright-explained-meme-ban) article

&gt;An earlier version of the Directive referred to “proportionate content recognition technologies” which sounds an awful lot like it’s asking platform owners to use automate filters to scan every piece of upload content and stop anything that might violate copyright from being uploaded.

&gt;**The latest amended version of the Directive removes this phrase and inserted an exception saying “special account shall be taken of fundamental rights, the use of exceptions and limitations as well as ensuring that the burden on SMEs remains appropriate and that automated blocking of content is avoided.”**

&gt;The reason why this article has been dubbed the “meme ban” is that no one is sure whether memes, which are often based on copyrighted images, will fall foul of these laws. Proponents of the legislation argue that memes are protected as parodies and so aren’t required to be removed under this directive, but others argue that filters won’t be able to distinguish between memes and other copyrighted material so they’d end up being caught in the crossfire anyway.

But as the article specifies right above, the sentence about the filter was removed altogether. 

Article 12a is what worries me, mostly because it was inserted in the directive last minute and most MPs voted for the whole directive without noticing it. ",,/r/europe/comments/a3drz0/poland_rejects_the_eus_copyright_censorship_plans/eb7a3lr/,shine_free,1544085905

4749,"&gt;As a result of close cooperation, almost 4 000 kg of cocaine and hundreds of kilos of other drugs have been detected across Europe during the course of the investigation. By 12:00 on the action day, 84 suspects have been reported arrested, including high-ranking members of the mafia network. An estimated EUR 2 million in criminal assets are expected to be seized, and many witness hearings and house searches will be conducted, securing important evidence to be used at trial. Actions are also taking place in Suriname. (Click on image to enlarge).


So they confiscated four tons of drugs, 2 million dollars and arrested 84 people from an organisation that is estimated to 1) import 80% of Europe's cocaine, 2) have earnings that amount to 3% of *Italy's GDP* and 3) is thought to have about 6,000 members.

4750,"I used to work in a telesales department (very happy that I don't anymore lol) that followed GDPR so I may have a piece of information to add here. 

This was in the Netherlands and we have the ""belmenietregister"" (do-not-call-me-register) which I'm assuming is functionally the same thing as your nope register.
The reason that we were still allowed to call a lot of the people on that register, is as follows.
If you have a billing relationship with the company, or have had a billing relationship with that company in the last couple of years, then they legally have ""reason to call you"" and the belmenietregister doesn't apply.
Also, if you don't pay attention to which boxes you tick when you visit certain websites, you may give permission for a company to contact you and then the register also doesn't apply. But that isn't as common as thr billing relationship thing.
So, if you had a subscription with newspaper X until 7 years ago, and then a couple of years ago you accepted a free trial subscription of the newspaper (it counts), then they're still allowed to call you.

You can indeed ask to have your phone number removed from their database, this is known in the NL as the ""recht van verzet"" (right of resistance), that then applies to the company that is calling you only.
So, newspaper X will lose your number. Newspapers Y, Z and phone companies E, G and K will not be affected.

But yeah, a great amount of people don't know about the recht van verzet, even though at the end of every phone call we had the obligation to read this text word for word, which tells about both the bel-me-niet register and the recht van verzet. So it does help to spread the word through other means, thanks OP!",,/r/europe/comments/a3ejbf/praise_be_to_gdpr_or_how_to_get_rid_of/eb75t4p/,ThessWaan,1544079016

&gt;I just know that someone generally doesn't take the time and energy to beat the shit out of you unless you did something to provoke them.

Boxing is a recreational sport?

Maybe they just wanted to beat someone up. Again your insinuations are completely worthless.

4823,"Right, and I'm definatley not trying to be rude or insulting. 

I'm just saying that the rote memorization of nations starts to wear off when people leave school, leaving many minor geographical facts to be forgotten. The impact of some European nations on the global scale or average American's life can be pretty small, much like the impact a US state would have the global scale or average European's life. 

That was more the root of my comparison. What happens in the Ukraine -even with the actions of Russia in Crimea has not had a large global impact, and almost no impact on me as an American (aside from availability of some Russian milsurp). 

I get that there's a difference because the US states are non sovereign, and European nations are sovereign (seems to be headed towards a unified government under the EU).

I feel like the existance and rapid expansions of the EU makes my point to an extent. To have more power on a global scale Europe is unifying, because as individuals they can be small players beside the US and China.

4830,"&gt;Do people in the US really discriminate that much depending what University you went to or is it over exaggerated?

It depends on what you do.  In some fields, going to an Ivy League school is very important.  

Do not mistake what they are for.  They are not just places of education...you can get an education just as good at several dozen other universities in the US...they are the means by which the wealthy and elite of society justify their place.  Their admissions criteria disproportionately favor those with the ability to be 'exceptional,' such as going to expensive private feeder schools designed to get one into those places.  

Money attracts money, and money hires money.  So for a very selective sort of position, if you have two candidates of equal quality, one from an Ivy like Harvard or Yale and the other from a public school like Penn State or University of Georgia, they'll go with the Ivy League grad.  It's not fair, it's not right, but it is what happens.

I agree with you, the inequality is disturbing, even more so because they have convinced the world that, if you put a prestigious face on classism, it is fair.

Not received like that at all, and neither any intention from my side!

I just think its interesting to have these different viewing angles between Europeans and Americans. That has nothing to do with dumb or smart, to be honest in my experience a major factor is information. US news is, for understandable reasons, more focused inwards, but this balance seems to have shifted over time to an extreme situation where it requires effort to find foreign news at all.
Yes, we learned in school where all the countries are, but I'd probably have forgotten if they wouldn't come by regularly in different news reports.
But I'm not sorting my interest according the impact a country has on my life, I'm just more generally interested in the whole planet I guess - might be an effect of more global news covering, or a cultural thing.

4997,"Yes, Bohemia had an Estate General, where the power of the emperor was shared with three classes. By 1419, the classes were divided between a higher nobility, lower nobility, and clergy. After the Hussite wars, the clergy was eliminated, and the church hierarchy disintegrated in the 1420s. The clergy were replaced with a free royal urban class. This system lasted until the Austrian conquest in 1620.    

Bohemian and Moravian nobility had a lot of power, that even Charles IV had to acknowledge its power and the limit of his rule. The Bohemian nobility not only disposed entire dynasty, but also elected another one, like Luxembourg in 1310. In 1419, it dethroned an Emperor Sigmund, and created a military dictatorship together with Prague in a period called interregnum (a time without a king), lasting till 1458. George of Podebrady was a magnate that became a king, and it was also a nobility that later tried to dispose him. The nobility also elected Jagellonian dynasty in 1471 and Haspburgs in 1526. The power of the nobility was destroyed after the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620 when the majority of them lost their property, and lives at the hand of Vienna.    

The nobility was a significant stabilizer of the medieval Bohemia, which was the reason, why this entity became the biggest and the most populous territory in entire HRE for 350 years. It prevented any carving of the territory, and was a guarantor of both of the religious freedom acknowledged in 1485, and Estate General. The nobility had a strong dislike toward Roman church, even if many were Catholics, because it has seen it as a leech upon the society living off its money that could belong to them instead of the church.",,/r/europe/comments/a38wca/what_do_you_know_about_the_holy_roman_empire/eb6tm8c/,kaik1914,1544065786
4998,"To add to your long post, the disorganization also comes from the fact that a crap ton of different movements are gluing themselves on top of the already existing movement. This weekend, for example, on top of everyone already there we had teenagers fighting against the general trend of reform of the education, people who work in the medico-social field who are tired of the general trend of choices made in this entire field and people from suburbs fighting against police violence who all joined the movement even though they might not agree with the ideas of people already there.

For the next weekend, it as already been announced that people working in the transport industry, who fight against the tax but weren't part of it before, lawyers and other people working in justice fighting against the general trend of reform of justice, fire-fighters fighting against the lack of funding for them and even some cops (not the policemen themselves, who don't have the right to go on strike, but people working for them or around them, like their administration or cooks for example, and yes the idea that the cops' cooks might go on strike is something a syndicate actually talked about and not a French joke) fighting against the lack of funding for them and the general strategy of the ministry of the interior will join the movement. 

We also had on r/France someone saying that one of their friend who work for the anti-riot police decided to put their holiday for this weekend because they know they'll receive the order to commit violent acts against people who they agree with and who come from the same social group as them, and that's not something they're willing to do.

And for this weekend, we have a national march for the climate and the organizer have called the Gilets Jaunes for a joined march, so we might see things like the [guard of honor for the march against violence against women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CN3ooQygTo), at least, maybe even another movement joining this movement of movements, we'll see. 

It already was an unorganized movement at the start, but now, it's closer to a general wave of discontent. They just all agree that they disagree with the current government, but that's pretty much it.

In contrast, there were several far-left parties like Podemos and Izquierda Unida, plus nationalist parties which are usually very far-left as well, but no equivalent in the right. They kept getting closer and closer to forming a coalition government with PSOE, it was bound to happen that a far-right political party would appear to prevent that.

I'm centrist leaning to the right, Vox's program is quite extreme in several areas, but meanwhile Podemos and the nationalist parties have been wasting their time in pointless reforms that do not help the working class. Franco died in 1975, and yet trying to move the body to another cemetery has been the highlight of the PSOE government in a few months that's been in office.

They control most of Europe's drug trade, individual clans operate simultaneously on multiple continents and their net income is higher than Deutsch bank.

The mafia and camorra have simple structures, ndrangheta clans are organized into the lesser society (which handles legbreaking and so on) and greater society (dealing with corruption and more complex crimes). Wiretaps have revealed that the 'honored society' has deeply esoteric rituals at every level (as opposed to usual one off initiation ceremonies that most gangs have). The ndragheta also has a secret society within the society itself; it almost seems too farfetched to be plausible.

&gt; That means that every regional party would be illegal, just like that

Nope, most regional parties  don't want to destroy the territorial unity of the Nation and its sovereignty.

Most regional parties do NOT defend the independence of their regions.

Why would you lie like that?

Seriously?

&gt;See you later, freedom of speech.

Spain isn't the US. Spain is like most of Europe, where most of that stuff is already punished. They just want bigger penalties.

Now explain how you go from here to ""openly defend the establishment of a dictartorship""? 


&gt;This one is pretty self explanatory. One ring to rule them all!

Yeah, it'd make Spain like, I don't know, Portugal. 

Not a dictatorship.


&gt;This one means: You will be kicked out of government if we don't like you, also you won't be allowed to work anywere else. Also with some ""we are hard against corruption"" populism sprinkled for good measure.

No, it doesn't mean such a thing and that is sort an unhinged interpretation I don't even know what to say. Are you well? Your translation is terrible by the way: are you sure you understood the original phrasing?

It's an anti-corruption measure that, by the way, is similar to those in existence in plenty of countries and is an absolute rip off from the Cs and Podemos, that have been pushing for it since ever. In fact, it exists in Spain too, they merely want to make it more effective.

Not a dictatorship, maybe? 

&gt;For those that don't know it, every single administration have negotiated with ETA at some point. So a lot of people from both major parties (PP and PSOE) will get... I don't know, thrown in prison? Maybe?

""Depuracion de responsabilidades"" doesn't mean throwing people in jail or anything remotely close to it.

Turns out you don't even speak Spanish - you're google translating it, aren't you?

&gt;So... what's the point of getting rid of the Constitutional Court? Is it bothering you for some reason? Maybe you want to do naughty things to the Constitution?

They don't want to get rid of the constitutional court, they want to make it part of the Supreme, in order to make it independent of the political branch. 

Imagine being so deranged you find yourself trying to claim that putting an end to the practice of politicians picking up judges means you want to mess with the courts.

Seriously, why do you do this?

They're literally saying they want a full independent judicial system and that judges and other magistrates should vote on judges to higher courts.

And what you take from that is that they want to do ""naughty things to the Constitution""? 

I mean, are you aware this *is actuallty one of the most emblematic proposal from the Cs* and a very popular one?

Of course you aren't. I doubt you know anything about the Spanisgh judiciary system, about the relationship between the Supreme (the highest court in Spain's judicial system, btw) and the Constitutional, why lots of people, from all over hte political spectrum, want to end the COnstitutional as it is and just integrate it in the Supreme.

Your claim was that Vox wants to establish a dictatorship and doesn't even hide it.

You couldn't even show they want to establish a dictatorship, let alone that they don't even try to hide it.

Pro-tip: people like you are Vox best friends. Instead of attacking their actual positions, you attack positions they don't have (like illegalizing all regional parties, throw people who negotiated with ETA in jail and so on - and, of course, of openly defending a dictatorship).

Yet anyone can actually read or listen to their proposals - do you really think your deranged arguments (""Hurr durr they want to integrate the Constitutional into the Supreme Court, like the Cs, and PSOE in the pastm and lots of people, so that must mean they want to abolish the Constitution and implement a dictatorship!!!!"".)

Seriously, people like you are the worst. You know nothing, you don't know the issues, you don't read about them and your entire worldview is basically a pastiche of comic books , with good guys and evil bad guys and everything about the bad guys must be the worst possible (even absolutely normal policy proposals that are exactly the same proposed by other parties must have some sinister reasons).

5215,"&gt;NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the initiative of Kosovo to create its Army is ill-timed and goes against the advice of many NATO Allies. He said intentions of Kosovo authorities to move ahead with transformation of the KSF into an army may have serious repercussions for Kosovo’s future Euro-Atlantic integration.

&gt;Addressing media following the meeting of the North Atlantic Council, Stoltenberg confirmed that one of the topics discussed was also Kosovo’s intention to move ahead with the transformation of the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) into an army. “Such a move is ill-timed. It goes against the advice of many NATO Allies. And may have serious repercussions for Kosovo’s future Euro-Atlantic integration,” he said. Stoltenberg assessed that the new tariffs introduced by Pristina create new divisions. “Such steps are making the EU-mediated dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina even more difficult. But this remains the only way to bring durable peace to the region. We encourage both Belgrade and Pristina to show restraint. To refrain from provocative steps and statements. And to make the necessary compromises so that they can move forward towards a better future,” he said. Kosovo Parliament is set to vote on 14 December a package of laws on transition of the lightly armed KSF into Army of Kosovo.

&gt;Monday 10 December EU member states will vote on a package of regulations requiring manufacturers to make consumer and industrial products more repairable and energy-efficient in order to be approved in the EU single market.

&gt;Pressure from industry lobbying in countries with a big manufacturing sector like Germany, Italy and the UK, has reduced the repair provisions in the proposed legislation.

&gt;Changes in the latest draft include:

&gt;-Appliance manufacturers wouldn’t be required to supply spare parts to third parties for the first two years from the introduction of a new model.

&gt;-Rather than providing free access to repair information for all, access could be restricted to registered, professional repairers who pay the manufacturers a fee. 

&gt;-Design requirements to simplify disassembly of appliances for repair is at risk of being replaced with a focus on effective dismantling for recycling at the end of life.

5240,"&gt;This always disturbed me a bit, for a country so immensely large, how is it you only hear of about 5 universities, in the media, in TV shows, from politicians and other professions.

They aren't five, but it's because those are the best universities in the world (alongside Cambridge and Oxford). I really don't understand why that surprises you or disturbs you.

Also, are you implying that's a problem specifically for the US? I don't really hear about any university in Germany, for example, or most European countries, except for the UK. Do you think that's better? Seriously, why?

&gt;Do people in the US really discriminate that much depending what University you went to or is it over exaggerated?

What? It's not ""discrimination"" in the popular, negative connotation of the word if it makes sense and is not in any way oppressive. Someone who graduated Summa Cum Laude from Harvard, everything else being equal, is likely a better candidate than I am. That's not discrimination. That's common sense.

To try to answer your question, even though I think it's very misleadingly and disingenuously posed, the most prestigious work places generally recruit from the most prestigious universities. The extend to which they would emphasize the place of higher education is heavily dependent on location, industry and other factors.

I've heard that the law school from which they graduated is very important for lawyers in New York City, to the point where you basically have to go to a prestigious school to get a top position.

5289,"what a load of rubbish, there are too many variables to claim that charging higher fees = more equality. The fact the general premise makes absolutely no sense should be enough of a warning sign.

Since fees were first introduced a number of things have happened:

* More universities have been created, many just by rebranding polytechnics as ""universities""
* More courses have been created, some of questionable academic value.
* Definition of what level a ""degree course"" is has changed.
* Rise in unconditional offers, often from lower placed universities in league.
* Universities have become commercialised, students are now customers.
* Cap on university places has been reduced/removed

Its political smoke and mirrors. Charging fees is unpopular with most of the public (who intend to send their children to university) therefore dress it up as something positive, whip out the student loans, and don't look back. Both the government and universities have a vested interest in charging fees, and finding reasons to justify charging for fees.

Predominately people who recognise the negative impact and baggage it brings simply want to stop importing the problem, because it is an imported issue. Conversion rates are a drop in the ocean compared to immigration. Generally limiting immigration is probably the simplest policy to avoid making the situation any worse.


Dealing with the baggage is a much more complicated issue and is already happening everywhere out of necessity. It involves social services and local police having to learn and adapt to new challenges such as how women are treated in these communities, honour based violence, sectarian strife between sects and recognising and clamping down on extremist preaching and of course the mammoth behind the scenes workload of related anti-terror activities.


Related to that integration issues and perceived loss of local culture are even harder to pin down. But again the simplest fact is that integration has no hope if immigration levels continue to be so huge.

The HRE claimed to be Roman because the Pope crowned the Emperor. The Pope claimed he could crown the Emperor based on a forged document (the Donation of Constantine).

5322,"Ok, just have time to watch the video in question and here is summary of it, let me know what you disagree with.

1) John only mentioned the disable girl for like 2 min during the entire video. He also specifically said at 12:44: ""Not every single asylum seeker is going to be the perfect economy wellspring"". 

His reasoning bringing up the girl is because he thinks no country should refuse immigrants in case they miss out on someone as amazing as her. I do admit that this argument can goes both way. But like I said, only 2 min of a 18min vid.

2) He focus instead a lot on how a lot of europe countries are unwelcomed to refugees (exception example would be Germany) and here's some example:

- Registration forms being badly made (gave 2 examples of one in Greece and another in Turkey)

- Countries have shown to be hostile towards refugee/refusing to let them in, proof can be seen in videos. Examples: Netherlands, Hungary, Danish

- Hungary have also been shown on video treating immigrants like literal animals, notably there's even a working Hungarian women kicking children and men holding babies 

- Greece only accepts Christians refugees because they don't have enough mosk (this is somewhat of a valid excuse to a certain extend)

- Polist MEP saying that Europe are letting in people that are not working, referring them as lazy and human trash. Though a lot of studies have shown otherwise. For example: refugees have shown that in the long term, they are raising the wages for everyone or that 19 of the 20 industrialized countries got benefited with their arrival. 

- Another argument from Oliver for having refugee would be to help increase the EU population (since womens are having less than 2 kids atm).

-----

So that's my summary, what are you disagreeing with in there? Where do you think he's being bias?

On top of that I want ask you some question (in case you don't answer these in your reply):

a) what do you think are the downsides of letting in refugees? Why is it bad for your country? If you have some, can you link studies with it? Because studies have also shown that there is no evidence of bankruptcy if you accept them, nor do they bring in isis members (this is also said in the video).

b) if you use the whataboutism method, as in the US is worse, how can Oliver criticize EU? Then I can remind you that he also did a lot of videos on US refugee where he condemn the system (notably Trump's). So if he's being consistent that every country should let refugees in, how can you bring up whataboutism?

This would ensure the best economic use of cars and help control traffic. It could also help capture some of the negative externalities of private car usage.

On your second point. Does the Danish free education system continue indefinitely i.e. could you spend your life in free education or does the country also believe there is a limit to how much tax money should be spent?

The U.K. has a very progressive personal tax system so that no matter your educational background, those with the higher income pay a higher share of their income to tax.

The benefit at a macro level of people completing a degree, once you reach the high levels of the U.K. is more complex than a linear: more degrees means more economic growth. The degree is likely though to result in that person being in the higher deciles of income.

The U.K. system simply means that the people who don't receive a degree, typically from less well off backgrounds, and which costs £27,750, aren't subsiding those that do. You will only then pay the loan back if you achieve a high income.

It introduces a new level of fairness to the system compared to everyone who wants it can get it funded through the general tax payer.",,/r/europe/comments/a3aaal/tuition_fees_for_scottish_universities_for_eu/eb5m11w/,thepurplescope,1544034768

5376,"&gt; By standarts of the time is a weird concept there. Even vast majority of the British population (not the British Empire of course since it would take the whole figures to the very bottom) was poor and even poorer than relatively poorer countries, unenlightened and most of the country was backwards.

Not as much as you'd expect, even the poorest and most rural peasant still lived in the heart of a global empire that was more or less running an increasingly globalized world and that's without ignoring massive amount of urbanization that was occurring (and cities give access to knowledge and new commodities) and increasing living standards (British had the highest GDP per capita in Europe for all of 19th century by a long, long shot). 

I mean tea, which is an East Asian drink with no connection to Britain, became a national drink in the 19th century with even the poorest of peasants picking up the habits. Literacy was rising and in overcrowded cities people could get access to new ideas, hence rapid spread of socialism and communism among factory workers.

To say that average poor person in 19th century England was as backwards and unenlightened as your average medieval peasant is simply wrong.",,/r/europe/comments/a39skg/mahmud_ii_before_and_after_dress_code_reform/eb5m6g7/,nrrp,1544034864

5460,"Your comment is folly, and I will explain why.

I am not dismissing the term. I am criticizing that it is a word which is in itself used to dismiss other arguments. The term ""dogwhistle"" is used in itself to dismiss entire arguments and lines of thinking because they are 'wrongthink' and considered unacceptable to the current status quo.

Let me provide some examples with and without a 'dogwhistle'.

**With:**

Person 1: An uncivilized people may not enter our borders.

Person 2: 'Uncivilized' is dogwhistle!

**Without:**

Person 1: An uncivilized people may not enter our borders.

Person 2: What do you mean by uncivilized in this context?

You see, /u/TheIrishRover23, having a singular term which can make thought irrelevant is exactly what Orwell was warning us about. Notice how in the 2nd example, an actual discussion can take place instead of a line of thinking being dismissed with one word because it fits the frame of what is considered unacceptable thinking?

So, we can draw from this that I was originally correct; using the word 'dogwhistle' as a catch-all term for dismissing arguments you consider 'wrongthink', you are the one in the wrong.

Moreover, to your last point, I believe you are better than feigning ignorance in your argument. You know well and good that when I say that it is a made up term I meant that it is made up recently for a political purpose (in this case, having the catch-all term as I mentioned). Of course all words are technically ""made up"", but I think you can see the idea here. I can make up a word too, 'cathearing', but that doesn't make it as valid as any other word.",,/r/europe/comments/a398t1/the_growth_of_the_farright_spanish_party_vox/eb5awmr/,Pale_Administration,1544027183

5479,"&gt;Staying in the center

A fundamental value proposition that cannot be sold to any area that did not benefit from neo-liberal economics applied by parties *in the centre*. 

We have been in the centre for 40 years, and seen the worst decline of western civilization's key stats - such as life expectancy or having more success than your parents before you. Not to mention that the worst social issues we see today are with regards to the very same guest workers they opened our borders up to originally, which they did with no plan and no care to societal consequences, and now look where we are with the descendants of those original immigrants, as we import millions more.

I posit that anyone longing for a return to this, either belongs to the wealthy few who benefitted (You can imagine the extent, considering averages actually went down), or the urbanite class that has seen their incomes and opportunities increase dozen fold, each and every step representing nothing more than a relocation of opportunity from areas already poor in them (rural) to areas already abundant with them (urban). What's more, their wealth isolated them from the 'worst' groups of immigrants (The poor), while only exposing them to the best (the wealthy), giving them a completely distorted image of what interaction with immigrants is like at all. Glass houses and throwing stones, basically, except their house has a fucking private guard and a fence around it keeping anyone over a mile out.

There is a point to be made for not going for SOCIALLY extreme policies, but the parties at the centre are falling apart brick by brick as the dream of the middle class and social mobility falling apart exposes them for who they are: They're the agents of wealth. The middle managers of the conglomerates that run our world.

&gt; A country can only fund spending in three ways: fiscal, printing money, borrowing. When you borrow, you need to pay interest on that.

&gt;Starting with a focus in economically liberal stances and recentralization proposals, the focus of their message shifted towards stances compatible with European right-wing populism, endorsing anti-Islam and anti mass-immigration discourses as well as criticism of multiculturalism. Their view of European Union is that of a soft euroscepticism, arguing that Spain should make no sovereignty concessions to the EU, because they consider Spanish sovereignty to reside in the Spanish nation alone. However, they propose to remove Spain's autonomous communities, negating the sovereignty of other nationalities and regional identities within Spain.

Fox looks to me like a corporate sleeper cell implanted in government. In 2011, he resigned his post as defence secretary in disgrace after his extracurricular interests were exposed. 

He had set up an organisation called Atlantic Bridge, financed in large part by a hedge fund owner. It formed a partnership with a corporate lobbying group called the American Legislative Exchange Council, which is funded by tobacco, pharmaceutical and oil companies. Before it was struck off by the Charity Commission, it began assembling a transatlantic conclave of people who wished to see public services privatised and corporations released from regulation.

He allowed a lobbyist to attend his official meetings, without government clearance. He made misleading statements about these meetings, which were later disproved. It seems extraordinary to me that a man with such a past could have been brought back into government, let alone given such a crucial and sensitive role.

I had a C1 when I enrolled into my PhD, and is a level that confers professional competency. An B2 is an upper intermediate, and:

-Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in their field of specialization.

-Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party.

-Can produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options.
confers professional fluency. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages

That is enough to do an undergrad, and immersed in the native language is easy to jump from a B2 to a C1.


In fact, somebody with a C1 will know much more grammar than most of the native population without higher education, and to pass a C1 you usually have to be able to write and understand technical texts that many natives would struggle with.

&gt; In Denmark where I am from, university is free and you get financial support from the govt. and we have some of the highest upward social mobility in the world.

That may be true, but in the case of college education you are taking money from the uneducated and giving it to the educated. If you correlate that to income, that means taking from the poorer people to give to wealthier people. Now, you may like that system and I would imagine most people posting here have benefited from  from it so will probably like it more. But recognize that it's upward redistribution.

Would I like for someone else to have paid for my education? Absolutely, I'd think it's great.

5678,"&gt; Yet much of the Muslim world hates Israel largely because of what it's doing to Palestine.

So, Palestine is not doing anything, most of the Muslim world is.

&gt;And enemies of ISIS have sent tons of money and weapons to Kurds, causing several regional powers, like Turkey and Syria, to have to change their policies. 

So, enemies of ISIS gave weapons and training to the Kurds, thus influencing them. And just real quick, Turkey probably never going to change its stance on the Kurds, I don't know where you got that from.

&gt;Those policy changes originating from non-state actors ultimately can then have much more wide-reaching effects.

I thought you said that it was all state actors, i.e. most of the Muslim world and enemies of ISIS?

&gt;But all three are conglomerations of individuals. How can an individual have influence, but suddenly that influence disappears alllll the way up the hierarchy of human organization until you reach sovereign statehood? That makes no sense.

Again, none of these countries have statehood. And as an example, the Dalai Lama has influence over Tibetan Buddhism, but not over Tibet, as such he cannot use his influence through Tibet, if it doesn't exist as a state. He can be an influential person, but Tibet cannot be an influential state, because it is not a state. The same holds true for the leaders of Palestine (pick whichever leader you want) and Kurdistan (pick what ever ""state"" you want).

&gt;This depends I suppose on whether you mean legal sovereignty or practical sovereignty. The talk about representing oneself at some international institution I feel implies the former, but that's also difficult to discuss pre-1648.

There was no sovereignty before the Westphalian peace, so there is no discussion to be had. And international institutions were not a thing in the 17th century, so it's hard to see that as a requirement for sovereignty. Imo legal sovereignty is also a useless discussion, because all recognised nation states have legal sovereignty, but they do not necessarily have practical sovereignty.

Which angle exactly are you going at? Your wording says climate change to me, and yeah, the US is obviously among the biggest proportional contributors. China isn't. India isn't. 

Are you just talking about generally blaming all the bad shit going on in the world in general on America? Sure, but historically it's very difficult to find a world great power that is any better - powerful nations do bad things, and America isn't special. This is especially true of a global hegemon - think British Empire. Europe will probably never be integrated enough to be a hegemon, and most other parts of the world lack any amount of power to do so. But I see no evidence that any other world power taking the spot of global hegemon would be any better in any case. The two most likely, Russia and China, would be worse. 

It makes sense to criticize the US for the bad things the government does and continues to do. Americans do it all the damn time - it's basically a fucking pastime these days to talk about how bad the government is.

No. The sanction wore off in 1923. 1924-1928 were a golden age for the Weimar Republic. Well at least for voting class. That's why no one took him seriously and NSDAP had barely 12 seats. Until 1929. When the wall street crashed, the current politics still didn' care, but Hitler became known as a populist who ""will provide and take care of poor"" (At least to the public, because NSDAP had already around 100k members) while pointing at the ""golden age"" and saying how poor got fucked, while rich got richer. Especially Jews, who were already scapegoats of NSDAP. Suddenly, everyone who pumped money into Weimar Republic in 1924-1928 wanted their money back (especially US, duh), thus even rich got fucked, but politicians didn't address it. In the next election, the party got another 95 seats. In 1933, he became chancellor of the Third Reich.

5991,"It makes sense though. ""I don't know"" is nonsense and serves no purpose. It's a binary option of ""I know this is Ukraine"" or ""I don't know."" So the wrong people are the most important answers, they should pick where they *think* it might be. Knowing where Ukraine is? That's boring but good. Not knowing where Ukraine is? That's vague and thus boring. Thinking Ukraine might be on the left side of the world somehow? That's vastly more interesting. Thinking Ukraine is Canada? That's hysterical.

You wanna pick Belarus? That's fair. You're at least paying attention because of how much news comes from Russia bullying Ukraine - they share a border and you can extrapolate at least generally where Ukraine might be. Picking Kazakhstan, Belarus, I'd take Romania.

5998,"multinational companies, especially US-based ones like GAFA &amp; co, have the necessary corporate structure to exploit mismatches between national tax jurisdictions. they are able to shift profits between affiliated companies in different countries in order to minimise their overall tax liability.
of course, there are rules against that, but those rules are national rules with a national scope, therefore only partially effective against a multinational player.

now, the EU proposed 
- the CCTB (common corporate tax base): this means that the method of calculating the tax liability would be harmonised so that mismatches between european tax systems dissapear (as much as possible) --&gt; no way to exploit them anymore

 - or, alternatively, the CCCTB (common consolidated corporate tax base): this would mean that the competent tax authority of the company's EU head quarter would calculate and collect all taxes due in the EU which would later be allocated amongst the member states according to the business activity of the company.
e.g. a GAFA company has its EU head quarter in dublin, ireland, and does business in ireland (10%), france (40%) and germany (50%). the dublin tax authority would calculate and collect all taxes due in the EU. later, this tax would be distributed to ireland, france and germany according to their share.
