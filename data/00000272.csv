76,"&gt;Because it's not based on economics, but the economical deficit is one of many reasons of wanting independence.

Stick to the non-economic reasons if you don't want to come across as a pack of rich whiners. Catalonia is one of the richest regions in Spain, no one is going to empathize with the 'we are being robbed' complaints. 

&gt;It's not rubbish, the numbers are from the Spanish government

I'm not saying it's rubbish because I don't believe the numbers (although there are dozens of ways you could calculate them). I'm saying it's rubbish because the concept of a 'fiscal deficit' displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how governments work:

 1. The number should be reported as a percentage of total taxes collected from Catalonia. 16 billion without that context is a meaningless number. And how does this percentage compare to say the equivalent number for say California/New York in the US?
 2. The number fails to take into account the cost of centrally provided services such as the military, foreign affairs, trade, customs, border control, a central bank, and many more.
 3. The role of government *is* to redistribute income from wealthier areas to poorer areas. Would we pay any attention if Amancio Ortega starting complaining that he has a personal 'fiscal deficit'? No, of course he pays more than he receives, that is exactly how it should be. The real question is why do you believe the recipients of those redistributions are not deserving of it?

128,"Note that the Single Market is *not* just an FTA.

An FTA just says ""nobody imposes tariffs on anyone else"".

NAFTA goes a bit beyond that, and has some stuff to eliminate NTBs, like saying ""without a non-NTB justification, you need to also accept the product standards of other members"".  That works reasonably well for an organization with only three large members, can afford large and reputable bureaucracies, and more-or-less get along with each other, but I don't know if it could scale up to many states.  It would not work for the EU, due to the sheer number of states, some of which are tiny.  You cannot operate with 28 somewhat-different sets of product standards, including what some crazy group of three people in Malta came up with, with everyone accepting all of them.

However, a single market means that now you have *one* bureaucracy that decides on a single set of rules for everyone that everyone must conform too.

Objections to being required to conform to the Single Market rules was one major concern that people in the UK had to the EU.

Second, trade with Southeast Asia is disproportionately important for Australia and New Zealand.  So they may want to have more flexibility.

Third, I cannot imagine a world in which the UK rejects the bulk of EU single market standards in the near future.  The EU is a large market with which the UK is going to trade.  The UK already has processes and conventions in place that are compatible with the EU, and has only proposed piecemeal divergence from that, in the future.  The UK might well -- this will, from what's in the news, be what the US pushes for -- accept US standards as well.  But it cannot viably reject EU product standards in the near future, just on practical grounds.

In practice, my assumption is that the UK will continue to accept most EU standards, simply because it's a large market next door, with specific ""cut out"" exceptions where there's a strong British argument against it.  This was essentially what people pointing out that the British would need to accept EU rules without a say in them if it Brexited meant -- if it creates a ""British standard"" in a given area, it will be a market only a quarter the size of the non-UK EU, and miss out on benefits of economy-of-scale.  So it will probably default to accepting EU standards.

Ironically, the UK joining NAFTA would probably do a great deal to encourage the US to domestically-permit EU standards, at least in the immediate term, because the UK's product standards are compatible with the EU and I would assume that at least the bulk will be for some time.  Barring a revision to NAFTA, this would also mean the US, Mexican, and Canadian domestic market accepting (though not requiring) EU standards.  If that happened, it'd shut down any NTBs that the US, Mexico, and Canadian industries have against the EU unless and until the UK changed its standards...which would be economically-efficient for those countries, though probably extremely unpopular with industries that enjoy said protections...",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7hhqp4/brexit_nicola_sturgeon_says_scotland_should_be/dqsb7b1/,vokegaf,1512447751

133,"For fuck's sake, have some historical perspective.

45 years ago we were a centralist fascist dictatorship. 

40 years ago we went from a rogue fascist state to a pseudo-unionist country with recognized ""nationalities"" instead of one big and free (reference to the motto of francoist Spain)

30 years ago nobody could have even imagined gay marriage would be legal in Spain.

20 years ago, the party that is now leading the way for independence, Convergència was pacting with their now ""archenemies"", the PP.

10 years ago, I doubt, would have anyone imagined that we would be in the mess we're in right now.

Point being is that things change, and that we can change things. Changing things is hard, and that happens everywhere in the world, you like it or not.
Look up my comment history, I've defended many times ""pro-catalan independence"" things and have received a lot of heat let's say it for that. 

But we're not France, for fuck's sake. Most people in Spain, or may I rephrase this sentence, most down-to-earth people understand that not all parts of Spain are the same. And I believe, that most people in this country are like that.

&gt;And since catalans refuse to be _cleansed_ we have a huge mess.

That I kind of agree with, that being said, using the term ""cleansing"" is too much. It is just a testament on how much of our identity as human beings depends on ""governments"" and that is let me put it this way, bad. My identity shouldn't be decided by a government, be it a Catalan or Spanish one. Let's work to fix this, as I can assess for a matter of fact, that there are some parts of Catalan ""cultural"" education that are iffy at best in regard to historical accuracy (i.e. catalan-aragonese crown wtf) and in the rest of Spain the lack of awareness of a truly ""diverse"" country (i.e. yes catalans speak catalan, valencians speak valencian/catalan, basques speak basque, etc... all of them do so in conjunction with Spanish and that is it, they're like us for the most part when it fact that is not true).

206,"I agree with you in general, but you're expanding that list a bit artificially.
There are in fact 4 different plural marks to know: e (most masculine names), n/en (most feminine), er (mostly neutral) and s. The rest don't have plural marks. There are various rules to remember which names have which endings, but you don't need to know them to recognize a plural mark.

Then there are some vowels that change in the plural form: a, o and u which become respectively ä, ö and ü.

Also, german plurals are easy to recognize, since there's often ""die"" before them.

English on the other hand has one plural ending in s/es/ies, then a lot more exceptions: words without a plural form (like ""moose""), plurals in -ves, a weird list with mice, geese, men, feet, children, teeth, plus some latin, italian, french, greek (and maybe others) plurals which are often optional.

So it's true that german has more different plural forms than english - but it's essentially because german shows the grammatical genders more than english. An english speaker is familiar with the idea there are different ways to mark plural, and might very well use foreign plural marks for foreign words it if they know how to do it.

That's rather a linguistic problem than a grammatical one, I believe. Some languages are very conservative in the way they borrow foreign words and have special rules for them (and sometimes these rules change over time, mandarin is fascinating for this). English is not one of those languages (at least currently), and it depends on several factors whether a foreign word will keep its original plural form, will receive an english -s or will have no plural form at all despite having one its in original language. For example it's quite common for italian names to retain their italian plural.

And just a note about Munich/München: Munich is likely derived directly from ""Muni(c)h"", ""monk"" (or maybe Monasticum*). The name of the city is and has been singular in a lot of european languages, for example ""Monaco"" in italian, Monacho(n) in greek etc. I don't know why exactly, but it might be because the german plural ""Münichen"" for ""monks"" is in fact quite recent and ""Muni(c)h"" was originally called both ""ad Monaches"" (to the monks) and ""Monastichum"" (the monastery) or something like that. Which one was the first between München and Monaco or Munich? Hard to tell, but they are probably derived from the same original medieval latin name(s). In bavarian and german, the plural form remained, but in the other languages, the singular form remained. I don't think one is an alteration of the other - it could be possible for english and french ""Munich"" but it doesn't work for all the others, including the very interesting polish form: Monachium.

We must indeed be careful about city names, because what looks like a plural form might be something else. For example, english people (and even some english linguists...) sometimes think that the french name of London, ""Londres"", is a plural, while it's just an old french mark for nominative case (from latin's third declension). In the same way, english retained the old nominative mark for ""Lyons"", which is ""Lyon"" in modern french.",,/r/europe/comments/7hiu57/national_symbols_of_poland/dqs3dme/,AlienSpectator,1512439100

Romania was on the Entente side in WW1, so we were in the same side. That said, operations in Serbia had already ceased by the time Romania joined the war. We didn't do very well. 

Prior to WW2, Romania and Yugoslavia were together in a number of alliances, such as the so called *Little Entente* with Czechoslovakia against Hungary, and the *Balkan Pact*, along with Greece and Turkey. 

These alliances never amounted to much though, and Romania joined the Axis about half an year before Yugoslavia's partition.

 While Romanian troops (unlike Hungary and Italy) didn't participate in the invasion, Romanian airfields were used by Germany and German divisions invaded from Romanian territory. 

So ultimately, yes, Romania and Serbia were never in any serious, direct conflict. Quite rare for the Balkans. ",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7hjhbz/what_do_you_know_about_romania/dqs4oy6/,Relnor,1512440505

246,"No, they won't find it rude, but it's always better to ask ""Bonjour, parlez-vous anglais ?"" first (or at least ""Bonjour, do you speak english ?"". Then you wait for an answer, and then you ask your question in english. If they say no (and some will), it's no big deal, you can just answer ""merci quand même, aurevoir"" (thanks anyway, bye) and move on

Most french people labelled as ""rude"" by tourists are not, they just 1/ don't understand english 2/ understand but can't speak 3/ think they don't speak well enough to answer to you. French is a literary language and we're taught to be very careful of grammatical errors when using it. We tend to apply the same logic to english ""I should not speak because I can't speak perfectly"". 

I know it's weird, but we've been taught for generations that english is a threat to our culture and language so people are not the best in english and they expect you to make the effort to at least say a few words in French while visiting (bonjour / aurevoir / merci / non-merci). 

I always answer kindly to tourists, even if they don't speak french, but I appreciate the effort when they say ""bonjour"" and ""merci"". I do the same when visiting other countries.

Last tip: if you need help, try first to ask people between 25 and 35. They are the ones speaking the best english and will probably be able to help you.

That's 1 in each 3 persons. Which is by no means ''only''.


Even tough I support Spain's unity I truly think that the attitude of the spanish towards them is very bad. 


I see with 100% normality if they just want to speak catalan since it's Catalonia and it is their language. They see as a bad thing the education system being in catalan and I find that a very arrogant and stupid attitude by the spanish. They should accept and encourage it not try to supress and make it look a ultra nationalist thing. It's just people speaking their own language in their own land.

See for example Galiza, you have an average of 10/20 brazilian comments in every youtube video about the Galician language totally amazed by the fact that they understand EVERYTHING even better then european portuguese. But the spanish found a way of making people in Galiza believe that it's an old and outdated language that only very old farmers talk. You had a post here on this subreddit about ARTE being casted for France and Germany, meanwhile in Galiza they don't have acess to Portuguese TV channels.


They make people feel bad for not incorporating what the spanish values, culture and way of life are supposed to be by their beliefs.


Some people feel pressured and fight for rights especially the rich parts like Basque, Navarre and Catalonia because they aren't really dependent of Spain. Meanwhile the weak end up being ''hostages'' because they need it and other simply act like cattle and follow the crowd.


Attention: this is something that's not done with really bad intentions by the spanish in my opinion. They are all nice people but they really have problem with other then Castillan languages. They see something natural like speaking your own language as an attact to unity because they were led to believe it.


But secession is not the answer especially when it's led by far left/right (in this case left) movements. They didn't even showed a plan for an after independence eventuality. Like Currency? National bank? Health system? EU or not? Trade partnerships? Laws alterations? Etc?

Sure it was, the minority in the march, but the other people there, the march security and the police did not intervene. And the investigation, which started after many days gave no results for weeks, despite some people holding the banners not even having faces covered. While neo-Nazis are everywhere the fact that they seem to have immunity is not common. If the few (yes probably a 100 out of 60 thousand marchers) were treated (see prosecuted) as they would be in Germany, France or the UK, this would also be reported, really it would. It’s easy to say that it wouldn’t when you have no proof. However the goverments and police/prosecution immunity given to neo-Nazis is what you should blame and not mainstream newspapers. When the police force of a country can’t catch a neo-Nazi who goes unmasked and boasts on Facebook, the country has a problem. Especially as normally the Polish police is very efficient. So they could catch them easily, and would do that under all previous governments... so as we all know the police did not lose it’s skill from day to day. It’s government policy. And if you have such government policy, well, who sows the wind reaps the storm, so your government’s immunity to neo-Nazis is to blame, not mainstream media...",Europe,/r/europe/comments/7hjy4i/meanwhile_in_warsaw_metro/dqrwxp0/,JoseMikey,1512431842

310,"It was not a very well-formed theory but it occurred to me that after Lubbers, pretty much all the CDA leaders were protestants: Brinkman, Heerma, Balkenende and now Buma. My association with the Catholics is precisely the old Juncker/Kohl/Andreotti style politics where principles are subordinate to greasing the wheels to get things done, and perhaps lining your pocket along the way. 

Dutch protestantism is to my mind more rigid and principled  (all the protestants we sent over to the USA became evangelical Republicans), fully convinced of its own rightness never mind how hypocritical it may be. It is also fully capable of justifying its means by the ends. The difference between the CU and the CDA then is mainly that the former have actually read the Bible, including Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. The latter merely pretend they did, and so as a result were able to create a story where implementing austerity policies is somehow the Christian thing to do, and where the goal of returning the CDA to power was well worth joining a government with the support of the PVV. 

Buma I can't fully figure out (maybe he really thinks Christianity is under threat from Islam in the Netherlands, though I sort of doubt it), but I think he is totally comfortable doing whatever he has to return the CDA to glory regardless how Christian his means to do so actually are, all the while convinced that they are justified by the end.

No, it isnt a conspiracy, just stupid fucks lucrating off of importing shit from elsewhere, pumping and dumping as much as they can. 90% of the time they're Romanian.

There is a higher probability to die in a Romanian hospital than it is to medicate yourself. Most Doctors in Romania have paid bribes to get their degree.

Corruption everywhere.

Filled with alcoholics, retired people, retarded people, gypsies, and scum.

A whore is 33€ to 50€ an hour.

A salary is between 300€ and 700€. 
Hah, who am I kidding? It's 330€ for +70% of the working population.

Mathematically speaking Romania will stop existing in 2060, when a single workers tax rate will have to support about 7 retired people. The only people having children are gypsies, who don't work, and whose children will never work for the Gagii/Gadje/Gadjo.
Romania is, slowly, turning into a gypsi majority country. 😂😂😂.

I can't blame Romanians who delay having children when the salaries are shit, the medical system is shit, schools are falling to pieces and the education system is corrupt to the bone.

Anyone going back to Romania ends up being burned out by the corrupt system and then leaving again.

The only ""good"" Romanians hold a job or are actively searching for a job in Western Europe. And in their innate stupidity will try to ""go back home"" once every few years, only to be pushed back by the same scum who made them leave in the first place.

Norway got all the cool nature. We have some nice stuff too, but Norway does it better. We probably have more interesting cities though, but again, Stockholm is really the only one I would recommend visiting unless you absolutely want to go to Sweden and not somewhere else. But there are so many places to see in the world that I feel like if you've been in Stockholm there's not much reason to go back to Sweden unless you really liked it. 

But it also depends on what type of person/traveller/tourist you are. I really like living in Gothenburg for example, so if you just want a chill place to ""pretend live"" or something like that for a while, not doing anything out of the ordinary, just be in a different place, then it could be good.

638,"A lot of gaslighting. Let's begin:

&gt; ""Xenophilia is a mental health illness."" You are the idealistic right-wing that doesn't care the PSD core is simply a clan of thieves struggling for power as long as they spout right-wing propaganda in line with your ideals. If they continue to do so, you hope some actual Iron Guard revival will come in to power. I had a friend like you.

Wow, such grand detail. Only that you forget the Iron Guard was a germanophile front for the germans; much like today others are xenophiliac, no different than the Iron Guard. The communists too were Soviet sympathizers.

”Right-wing” - you're correct. I am right-wing &amp; always will be. You know why? Because I'm not a bootlicker to others just because they speak a different language, and that they were born in a different country. I never grasped this servience, it premeditates betrayal &amp; distrust among us. You're accusing me for being a ”legionnaire”, well, if that wasn't wrong enough, *you* are actually a ”legionnaire” for others... much like the Iron Guard was, actually, towards the german nazis &amp; italian fascists. And how the communists (at least the early ones) were Soviet sympathizers. 

Cynnically funny that xenophilia is self-cannibalising itself in more ways than one.

&gt; 1) This guy is actually protesting against foreign capital and foreign investment. Guess he likes the population of the country to be poor - eat polenta for life, cause that's traditional.

Thank you for not denying we are a colony, respectively a 'country' on life support. Thank you for your honesty, I think, perhaps, this is the only time I'll see it from you.

&gt; 2) Maybe forcing NGOs to disclose donations of over 100 euros would not be a bad idea. But the current implementation forces NGOs to find out information even for 2$ SMS donation - every 6 months! It practically freezes NGOs in to becoming accounting firms. At the same time, PSD voted a law that allows parties to not have donated illegal money confiscated from them ( rebuked by the Constitutional Court )

What's the matter, aren't you happy &amp; glad to find out who's financing NGOs, especially those supplied by foreign actors &amp; interest groups? 

&gt; 3) Accountability of the justice system should be done only by the justice system. 

The president (the #1 in the country) nominates &amp; decides who are the prosecutors &amp; judges (at high level and not only) in this country. Effectively making the #2 &amp; #3 of the country (the Senate leader &amp; Chamber leader) lives miserable on charges, *not* condemnations.

How about next time Iohannis talks with other foreign leaders about corruption &amp; how the #2 &amp; #3 are charged with corruption, the correct answer is: ”I'm naming the prosecutors &amp; judges to make their lives miserable”. The correct answer.                 
Btw, the justice system falls under the Minister of Justice. Seems that's a problem for a lot of shills &amp; morons.

&gt; 3) Without independence of the justice, you can piss on all your North-Korea-level of democracy.

The justice system isn't independent nor accountable. 

&gt; PSD is trying to subjugate justice to Parliament. The cancer patient is getting his justice. Where is the justice for Colectiv victims, all those who are in hospitals in conditions worse than prison, all those who have been mutilated for life during the Mineriads ?

Remember: the Parliament is the representative body of the people. Whoever read your comment, this part here, will deduce that you're more authoritarian than I am from your accusations. 

Remember that. 

As for the Colectiv victims, have they not been treated outside the country?                  
The Mineriad... that's 20 years ago. Cosma faced jail time, Nastase faced jail time (infuriatingly, not for the Mineriad, which shows the competence of these anti-corruption stooges &amp; their undeserving wages &amp; benefits)... you didn't had problems with the Mineriad 5 years ago, nor 10, suddenly you bring it up here?? Are you alright?

&gt;4) The budget surplus is being given by those in power! This tactic of blaming the secret services of serving the opposition, while at the same time increasing their budget is unbelievable. 

Did you or did you not clicked those links? Did you bothered to read them or simply refuse just because it shatters your perception?                 
Yes, the secret services haven't reformed and are meddling in the justice system &amp; creating hostility alongside those supported by NGO money. How matter morons they are, the protesters are in the wrong. 

Unbelievable? Why is it unbelievable? The prime-minister has relations with the ”intelligence” community. We're a counterintelligence state; a counterintelligence mindset in a state has nothing to do with democracy, transparency, separation of powers and, first and foremost, freedom.

&gt;It works wonders though. Didn't the secret service magically lost trace of Sebastian Ghita, who was PSD's lackey?

Sebastian Ghita **worked for them**, wiseguy. He was as much part of PSD as Maior (current ambassador to the USA). But what would *you* know...

&gt; 5) I distrust the banks and know their purpose is to make profit off of me and they are to blame for the 2009 crisis ( Tariceanu and Basescu hold the rest of the blame for ignoring the signals). But I still trust the banks more than the Parliament. What does that tell you about the Parliament?!

Whoever reads this part, shows how much xenophilia is a mental illness; to the point of not trusting the Parliament, the entity which represents all of us, and trusting some foreign financial institutions &amp; banks. Extremely worrisome.                     
Again, I can't stress this out since you've accused me of mumbo-jumbo ”legionnairism”, you are more authoritarian than you accused me to be. 

&gt;""They beat up a very old man with mental problems"". Nice fucking narrative. One idiot ( not ""they ) punched him because the old idiot cursed him and attacked him first. They were both stupid people, just like you are, both trying to create chaos from which they can profit. Just like you!

No, not one. All of them are complicit, all of them cheered, all approved of what he did to that old man. You're gaslighting again.

&gt;""Xenophilia is a mental health illness."" - this is all you need to take from his comment. He thinks if you have affection and understanding for other nations or people, you are mentally sick. What do you do with mental patients? Probably put in a mental institution at best ... or put them down.

I've already debunked this.

It renders the point moot.  Anyone can be right about stuff, but not everyone is fit to be elected to public office.

&gt;	 I was talking about the idea that ""left is good (or even GOD for someone) and right is wrong (or EVIL)"".

This isn’t really about left and right. Berlusconi is a convicted criminal. Salvini and Grillo are populists and have no coherent policy platform (somewhat unfair to Grillo, whose point is to do away with politics in its current form, but thats not workable now). Meloni is inconsequential.

The Etruria case is nothing like anything Berlusconi has been involved and as far as I can make out does not clearly involve Renzi (that bit is just vague speculation, more so than saying that Berlusconi is definitely a mafioso because of his stables minder).

Effectively ideas hardly enter into it - today the PD would be the only party I could vote for.  I say this as a typically (not Italian) centre-right voter (before we got hijacked by crazy fascists).

Target number implies that anyone brought the asylum seekers to Germany. But they come on there own. Due to not having non-Schengen land borders, Germany has very little influence on how many come. Merkel ""agreed"" to this whole scheme because the number of expected arrivals for this year is already below 200,000. It's stupid virtue signalling by the CSU, without any relevance in policy questions. 

&gt; I think some AfD voters aren't completely opposed to accepting refugees and all they wanted Merkel to do is to acknowledge that Germany can't take everyone.

That has always been obvious. In July 2015 Merkel told a 14 year old asylum seeker that Germany has to send people back if they don't qualify for asylum.

Republican paramilitaries combined are responsible for 2060 casualties during the Troubles:

727 Civilians
1080 British Security Forces
187 Republican paramilitaries (inclusive of accidents, informers and feuds)
56 Loyalist paramilitaries.
10 Irish security.

Loyalist paramilitaries killed 1016 people during the Troubles:

868 Civilians
14 British Security
41 Republican paramilitaries.
93 Loyalist paramilitaries (mostly feuds, some accidents)

85.43% of people killed by Loyalists were civilians. 4.7% of the people killed by Loyalists were Republican paramilitaries. That figure includes Republicans who were ex-paramilitaries. Loyalists killed more civilians then anyone during the Troubles.

The vast majority of the killings carried out by the Loyalists were random hits on civilians, no more complicated than a drive by or kidnapping. The British Army themselves would say that the IRA were a far more effective and determined organisation, they had to be, they were fighting an  army and a police force, the loyalists never attained the level of sophistication that the IRA had, not even close.

Education and health are just two areas but I think we need to constantly re-evaluate what we are doing and what we are paying for. I don't think the university system as it exists even makes any sense whatsoever for Computer Science, for example, yet we are piling a lot of tax dollars into that. There are many other degrees that don't benefit society but may benefit the individual - maybe we should consider if these should be privately funded, in the same way that Germany allows upgraded hospital beds to be privately funded.

If you just want to stick to education, I'd rather see school lunches for everyone than 0€ university. A lot of schools I've seen in Germany (maybe it's just my city) look rather run down. I'd rather see these cleaned up and looking like palaces (places of education shouldn't look like prisons) than have 0€ university.

In the ideal world, I want to pay for everything and have 0€ university. My only point originally was that by labeling university as ""free"", I think we lose sight of the fact that the money does actually come from a limited pot and that it could be going somewhere else.

I use it for a mixture of reasons. Firstly, it's what I'm best at - I started using this program when I was 13, and I'm now at the point where I model fast enough that I confuse clients.

Secondly, the presentation is excellent for illustrative purposes. To get a good looking end product from maya or similar, you have to set up lighting, any extra nodes you might want (outlines come to mind), then if you want a flythrough, you're gonna be waiting a few hours for the render or paying for space on a render farm. 

In SU you don't have to deal with any of that, and you get a predictable, clean result every time that's great for communicating concepts without extraneous bullshit. (This is presuming you avoid sketchup's default textures like the fucking plague in 90% of situations, those can often ruin a good visualisation)

Out of those, only *""rege""* means king and thus qualifies for this map. 

We have other words for leaders of other countries but this doesn't mean we called the leaders of our countries that. We have for example Pașă for Turkish leaders but we never had our own pașă, in certain places you'll hear the phrase *""crai de la răsărit""* which translates verbatim to ""crai from sunrise"" (which is to say East and that makes sense looking at this map.

*împărat* has equivalent in many languages: imperator in Italian, emperor in English, kaiser in German, but it is a step above *king* so doesn't qualify for this map.

As you pointed out, *cneaz* and *crai* are more regional nobility which had their own little patch of land they were administering, but a step or two below *king* so again not the same thing.

The only term which comes close is ""Domnitor"", which was a title given to the rulers of the Romanian Principalities before unification, though this is (rightfully) translated as ""Prince"" in English because it was understood that Romania should be a country in its own right but it was split into three because of competing political influences (Wallachia with the Ottomans, Transylvania with the Austro-Hungarians, and Moldavia which was less influenced from the outside).

And it's not too uncommon for people here to have like half of their net salary go to rent for example. Which I would think could be similar to the situation in Bulgaria.

922,"That's the top marginal tax rate for income tax (plus the solidarity tax, with which you get to 44.31%).

However: the top marginal tax rate only applies for any income in excess of about €54k. At the same time, at that level, social contributions are being phased out (for health insurance, contributions end at €53k, for pensions at €78k). This means that it takes some time before you really go past 40% of your income in total taxes and contributions.

It's also not clear whether one should put pension contributions (which amount to nearly 10% of your gross income) at the same level as taxes; unlike health insurance and other social contributions, they aren't really redistributive. The more you pay in, the more you get out.

1228,"&gt; Thousands of demonstrators — the police said as few as 2,500, while the organizers said as many as 20,000 — marched in Kyiv on Dec. 3 to demand passing a law on presidential impeachment to remove President Petro Poroshenko from office.
&gt; 
&gt; They walked from Taras Shevchenko Park through Khreshshatyk Street to Institutska Street and then to Yevropeiska Square.
&gt; 
&gt; The Ukrainian Constitution envisages presidential impeachment but a lack of a law that regulates impeachment procedures makesÂ theÂ impeachmentÂ of any president impossible in practice. The demonstrators called for a law that would allow any president to be impeached in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; The protest movement, which began on Oct. 17, initially called for the creation of an anti-corruption court, stripping lawmakers of immunity from prosecution and passing a fairer election law.
&gt; 
&gt; However, as the authorities failed to comply with their demands, the focus of the protests gradually shifted to presidential impeachment.
&gt; 
&gt; Ex-Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said at the rally that the protesters were giving a chance to parliament to comply with their demands next week but he did not expect the Verkhovna Rada to do that.
&gt; 
&gt; He scheduled the next rally for Dec. 10 on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the main site of the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution
&gt; 
&gt; He also said that impeachment committees would be created in all regions.
&gt; 
&gt; “Our enemy is the oligarchic system and one of its representatives – Petro Poroshenko,â€ Saakashvili said. â€œ… Even if (the authorities) expel me from the country, you should expel them from their offices.â€
&gt; 
&gt; Saakashvili said on Nov. 29 that, according to his sources, Poroshenko had given an order to arrest him and charge him with plotting a coup d’etat and could later expel him from Ukraine. The Presidential Administration did not respond to a request for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; The protesters also demanded the release of people they deem to be political prisoners, including Oleksandr Novikov, Anatoly Vynohrodsky and Leonid Lytvynenko – Ukrainian veterans of Russia’s war against Ukraine who were arrested in November and charged in two criminal cases.
&gt; 
&gt; They were among the co-organizers of the current protest tent camp in front of the Verkhovna Rada and are members of the Liberation movement, led by Samopomich Party lawmakers Semen Semenchenko and Yegor Sobolev.
&gt; 
&gt; Semenchenko and Sobolev argue that the veterans were arrested because of the protests.
&gt; 
&gt; The demonstrators also protested against the expulsion of Georgian associates of Saakashvili from the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Seven Georgian associates ofÂ Saakashvili, a co-organizer of the protests near the Verkhovna Rada, wereÂ deported to their homelandÂ on Nov. 17 andÂ Oct. 21Â in what they say wasÂ an illegal operation without due process or any court warrants. Several of them sayÂ they were beaten.
&gt; 
&gt; The authorities deny accusations of wrongdoing.
&gt; 
&gt; Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that one of the deported Georgians, Vano Nadiradze – was arrested on Dec. 3 by Ukrainian and Moldovan border guards as he was trying to cross the border into Ukraine. Nadiradze, a veteran of Ukraine’s war with Russia, had been deported despite the fact that his deportation had been banned by a court warrant.
&gt; 
&gt; Another theme of the protest was the authorities’ pressure on the independent National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; The demonstrators protested against what they deem to be Poroshenko’s efforts to crack down on NABU Chief Artem Sytnyk and destroy the bureau.
&gt; 
&gt; Sytnyk on Dec. 1 accused the authorities, including the Prosecutor Generalâ€™s Office and the Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, of foiling all NABU undercover operations and trying to destroy the bureau.
&gt; 
&gt; He said that the SBU and the Prosecutor Generalâ€™s Office had foiled NABU operations by illegally publishing the personal data of NABU undercover agents involved in a corruption case into the State Migration Service and obstructing the case.
&gt; 
&gt; The NABUâ€™s investigation against alleged corruption at the National Agency for Preventing Corruption on Nov. 28 was transferred on the orders of the Prosecutor Generalâ€™s Office from the NABU to the presidentially controlledÂ Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU.Â 
&gt; 
&gt; The transfer of the case to the SBU is deemed by critics to be an effort to bury the investigation, since the SBU is controlled by the Presidential Administration, which was accused by Hanna Solomatina, a whistleblower at the NAPC, of influencing her agency.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, several nationalist groups on Dec. 3 started a blockade of the NewsOne television channel, owned by lawmaker Yevgeny Murayev, an ex-member of former President Viktor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions. They barricaded the channel’s building with bags of sand, wooden planks and barbed wire.
&gt; 
&gt; The nationalists demanded that Murayev apologize for his claim that the EuroMaidan Revolution was a coup d’etat.
&gt; 
&gt; But Saakashvili and his supporters said that, although they disagree with Murayev, the blockade had been orchestrated by the authorities to pressure the opposition channel. NewsOne was one of the few channels that broadcast the Dec. 3 rally for impeachment and had repeatedly invited Saakashvili to its shows.",,/r/europe/comments/7hfisg/thousands_march_in_kyiv_to_impeach_poroshenko/dqqlscn/,Kavuny,1512368063

What all EU's leaders said was that once in motion, it would be very hard to  untangle the whole thing. And I do believe that we are way past the point that the UK can just say, screw it we don't want that anymore. 

The simple fact that the agencies have been reallocated and the EU's army comfirmed make it very hard for the UK to come back.

If the UK was to try such a move, it would end up being a decision taken by the European concil, i.e. by EU's leaders.

But what we are currently seeing with the Irish border issue is that the EU is aiming at keeping the UK in the custom union. And if the UK was to chicken out, that would probably what would be on offer to them : stay in the custom union, heck, stay in the single-market if you like, but your time with MPs in Brussels are over.

&gt;The development of glyphosate resistance in weed species is emerging as a costly problem.

Who is going to pay for removing glyphosate resistant weeds? The farmers and the consumers. 

Because glyphosate works best by inhibiting growth via leaves, the as yet formed, latent weeds are only slightly affected by roundup. When I've used it to clear my land 1 acre/0.4ha within 2-3 weeks new growth has shooted and I left it untreated. Within 4 weeks 75+% of the area previously covered with weeds had emerged and within 6 weeks it was worse because grass competition was gone. 

I now use mulch and the weeds that get through are hand weeded for no more than an 30 mins over a week. 

Roundup in my small experience is expensive, works on existing weeds not on latent / post sprayed new growth. 

It removes weeds but if not sprayed continuously has no residual weed control. You are locked in.

The loss of power which you may be experiencing as a country has far more aspects to it than where the EU seat is.

1507,"Yep. Well Hamon won the primary but his party didn't respect its word and he was a very lonely candidate (the -numerous- top members of the Socialist Party didn't back him up during the race, many of them actually made media appareances in which they criticized him instead of helping him. And many simply disappeared, letting him fight alone against Macron, Le Pen, Fillon and Mélenchon). As a result, most left-wing voters favoured either Macron or Mélenchon. 

 Things haven't changed since then. There was a survey this week that said that, unsurprinsingly, most French citizens -including most leftists- think the Socialist Party is in disarray (I can't remember what the exact questions were), people don't trust them anymore. Many top members of the Party have said, for years now, that the Party needs to be renamed (since June, the group in the Assembly isn't called ""Les Socialistes"" anymore, but ""Nouvelle Gauche""= ""New Left""), but in reality none of them seem eager to undergo a much needed self-exam. There are many Vallsists (although former PM Manuel Valls now joined Macron), many Holland-ists (whose political line is rather vague, to say the least), 
 and the Hamonists (on the left of the party) are a minority. The socialists are rather inaudible. As you said, it looks like it's going be the Macron flavour of third way for a while. 

Mélenchon was rather successful during the campaign, even though he lost (his ideas *were* audible, and many Frenchies acknowledged that his political movement was the main opponent to Macron this summer). Now, after a few ""controversies"", he seems to have lost a bit of his appeal and Macron seems even stronger than in June. So we'll see. It seems that the Socialist Party, the Republican Party and the National Front Party are all having the same kinds of troubles.

The UN agrees, that mass-deportation of people that oppose an occupying regime is indeed the crime of Genocide.

The important distinction is that whether a person is deported or not, does not depend on their own actions but the actions of a group they belong to(regime opposing Estonian/Latvians/Lithuanians).

The UN Also agrees, that to commit the crime of genocide, one doesn't need to be successful, but it is enough to Attempt to wipe out a group of people. In this case, the group was the people that opposed the occupying regime and that group was deported to Siberia(and other places) where they had little/no hope to maintain their original identity for more then a generation.

One does not need to be successful in extermination to commit the crime of genocide.

1564,"Theresa May will go into a crunch meeting with EU leaders on Monday admitting she is yet to find a solution to the Irish border problem, as a Cabinet minister suggested for the first time that Brexit might not happen.

Mrs May has until Monday night to meet an EU deadline for Britain to make “satisfactory progress” on the issues of money, citizens’ rights and the border in order to trigger trade talks this month.

She had hoped the meetings in Brussels with Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk would be the moment when trade talks would be unlocked, but Government sources were highly pessimistic about the prospect of a breakthrough, leaving the entire Brexit timetable in jeopardy.

It came as Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, told Tory rebels that if they did not back Mrs May in the negotiations “we will have no Brexit”.

With just 10 days to go until next week’s European Council summit, when EU leaders will decide whether trade talks can begin, Mrs May is rapidly running out of time to keep Brexit on track.

With no agreement in sight between London, Dublin and Belfast on the border issue, the Prime Minister is now likely to ask for a last-minute extension to the Monday deadline.

Whitehall sources bitterly complained that Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, had “moved the goalposts” by insisting on guarantees over the future border arrangements now, having earlier said the issue could be thrashed out once trade talks were underway.

Ireland is holding out for an assurance that it will have “regulatory convergence” with Northern Ireland, effectively meaning the border would move to the Irish Sea.

But the DUP, on which Mrs May relies for her Parliamentary majority, says it will not accept anything that is similar to staying in the customs union or the single market.

One Government source said there was “absolutely no prospect” of ministers going against the DUP’s wishes, adding: “The things that the Irish government wants us to sign up to are things that no British government could sign up to.”

Mr Hunt's warning is aimed at Tory backbenchers who have hinted that they would vote against a deal that involved paying £40 billion or more for the Brexit bill or gave the European Court of Justice any powers in British law after Brexit.

Such a scenario would risk ousting Mrs May from Downing Street and triggering a general election that could, if Jeremy Corbyn emerged as the victor, result in Labour calling a halt to Brexit.

Mr Corbyn said over the weekend that he has not yet decided whether Labour would hold a second referendum on Brexit if it won power.

Mr Hunt is the first Cabinet minister to raise the prospect that Brexit might not happen, and his comments reflected nervousness within Conservative ranks as today’s crucial meeting approached.

Mrs May will travel to Brussels with David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who will meet the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.

Mr Barnier will compile a report on Wednesday on whether “sufficient progress” has been made, which will be sent to the leaders of the other 27 EU member states before they meet at the EU Council on December 14 and 15.

Mrs May is desperate for the EU Council to agree for trade talks to begin, as any further delay would mean talks being unlikely to start before March, when the council next meets - a full year after Article 50 was triggered and only 12 months before Britain formally leaves the EU.

She may now ask Mr Barnier to delay today’s deadline by 24 hours, though Whitehall sources said they believed they had until the date of the EU Council meeting to solve the Irish border issue.

Ireland is threatening to veto trade talks unless Britain guarantees there will be no hard border, but Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader in Parliament, said any solution that involved an all-Ireland customs regime would force Northern Ireland ""further and further away"" from its main market, the UK.

He said the Irish government had adopted an “aggressive stance"" on Brexit which was “causing real damage to Anglo-Irish relations”.

He added: “They can't impose what is a good solution for the Irish Republic on the rest of us.""

Asked if the DUP might threaten to withdraw its support for Mrs May’s Government, he said: ""The DUP doesn't need to issue any threats whatsoever, because we're very very clear that the Goverment understands that anything that results in the undermining of the Union... we wouldn't go with that.""

Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, was equally firm, telling the BBC: “We cannot allow some kind of collateral damage or unintended consequence of Brexit to have the recreation of a border.""",,/r/europe/comments/7hdjh3/brexit_timetable_in_jeopardy_as_theresa_may_fails/dqq4lq6/,deadtreez,1512346316

After WWII was under the influence of the USSR but Portugal had also a protectionist dictatorship from the 1930s to 1974.  After the fall of the dictartorship it had a lot to run to catch back from the rest of Western Europe. Spain had the same issue with Franco but their economy was far more developed. After WWII Portugal was, in pair with the old Yugoslavia, the European countries with lowest education. Even when Portugal entered the EU (in 1986, the old CEE), it was mostly a rural country. When it comes to economical prosperity, Portugal has an old problem and Czech Republic has the advantage of having Germany as a neighbor, while Portugal has only Spain (and borders the poorest parts of Spain). 
There was a lot to do after 1974 and many mistakes haven been made but the task was very complicated (and not to mention the decolonisation process). We managed to do pretty good improvements, such has infrastructures or health care (we have one of the lowest child mortality in the world, for example). However, the economy still has many debilities and the 2008 crisis hit Portugal very hard, which made it even easier for the most developed countries in the old East Bloc to catch up. Portugal should have remained outside the Euro (but now leaving is not an option). Solving the problems now are very complicated and I don't have knowledge enough to point the best directions. But the country will be hit hard by climate change and has a declining population. Worst, it's youth is the most educated that the country ever had but failed to get a stable position in the market and most are leaving.

1676,"&gt; Mate, everybody knows what have happened in Yemen, and both Iran and Saudis&amp;Gulf having their proxies. Even small kids do know that US supplies arms to Saudis, while also backing them on many accounts. Thank you for the new info. /s

I'm not that convinced, but I wasn't there to bring fresh news anyway. Nothing that is being talked here is fresh news. 

&gt; I don't know about you, but I'd be ashamed if my country was supplying arms and enabling some to massacre civilians. If you're OK with it, cool, let's agree to disagree then. I'm sure you won't be happy when Saudi&amp;Iran proxy wars cause more immigrants though.

If I had picked the country I was born in and was actually in a position of influencing any choice concerning the weapon trades done by it and that France is ending selling weapon to countries like SA. Then yes I would be ashamed. You talked about small kids : Once you have grown up enough, you know that there's a good amount of people that are rotten to their core (the ones that usually end up at the top) and that it's useless for a single human being to try to stop all that shit. Countries that wield a certain amount of power will abuse it in one way or the other, just look at the history.

So you have two choice, crying and having trouble sleeping at night for nothing or ignoring it until the population realizes what happens here and live a happier life.

See, it's not about being ""from here"", although it's obviously comically typical for you to feverishly start stroking your xenophobia once you learn this; it's about you being unable to hack it intellectually. I don't even have to be smart if you're so not. Stop asking yourself why the ""elitists"" aren't responsive to your lowbrow concerns. Your concerns have no merit, you're a xenophobic, tub-thumping idiot and you always will be. 

&gt; had to get your information of what driven Brexit by a viral video

Why are Brexiteers such filthy liars? Do I need to summarize the evidence again?

Source one, Channel Four News:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqDGF4pSd_s

Source two, London School of Economics:

&gt; (...) many assume people voted Leave because they were primarily exercised by the issue of East European immigration. This turns out not to be the case.

&gt; We tend to make emotional decisions and rationalise these to ourselves after the fact. American social psychologist Jon Haidt calls our emotions the ‘elephant’ and our cognition the ‘rider’. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky prefer ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ thinking as the metaphor. Either way, our research shows that immigration in general – **notably non-EU immigration** – is the fast-thinking elephant behind the Leave vote.

...

&gt; What’s striking – and no one is talking about – is that **British voters prefer EU to non-EU migrants**: the blue bars representing desired levels of European immigration are higher than the red bars for preferred levels of non-European immigration among all British voters. 

http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/06/05/uk-voters-including-leavers-care-more-about-reducing-non-eu-than-eu-migration/

Source three, Yougov (thanks, idiot):

&gt; **Fewer are now worried about Bulgarians and Romanians coming to Britain, and more support free movement within the EU**

&gt; **Opinion has shifted mostly towards the view that there is “nothing wrong” with Romanians and Bulgarians having the right to come here and “we should welcome it”. 26% no choose this option, up from 16% in December.**

https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/05/16/bulgarian-and-romanian-immigration-worries-diminis/

&gt; oh and Scotland &amp; NI had plenty voting Leave

Nobody cares.

&gt; As for Russian trolls...truly desperate. 

That's why I have such contempt for you creatures: you have a complete lack of reading comprehension and honesty. So when I carefully choose ""exacerbate"", this means nothing to the pathologically lying Brexit monkey and it will dishonestly simplify to ""Russian trolls caused Brexit""

Brexit monkeys, like Trump tards, are mentally diseased liars, the conclusion is inescapable.

&gt; Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said he was not surprised at the news as he had already written to social media giants such as Twitter and Facebook asking them to reveal the Russian accounts which posted about UK politics.

&gt; He said: “This is the tip of the iceberg. From even the limited research that has been done, it is clear Russian organisations sought to target and influence voters during the Brexit debate.

For instance those from Kosovo, Albania, Serbia and rest of eastern europe are automatically rejected but the due process still has to be done. Most of them have returned on their own however.

You are aware that he was in charge of the concentration camp Dretelj were Muslims were housed like cattle and subject to abuse and torture right?

&gt;We were repeatedly refused entry to Dretelj. But eventually – for reasons best known to him – Praljak signed the order to let us in. When we rolled up at the former Yugoslav army base and presented the order to the camp commander, a Major Sakota, he was aghast but obeyed Praljak’s order, and in we went.

&gt;In one warehouse, hundreds of terrified men were packed, sitting or squatting; some time beforehand the door had been closed for 72 hours, leaving them suffocating in the heat and stench, drinking their own urine.

&gt;We proceeded to two hangars dug into a hill. The doors were open, but it was dark inside. The prisoners within were in an appalling state – skeletally thin, eyes unfocused, with skin problems. They told us how the doors were often locked and one night drunken guards had opened fire through them, killing and wounding several.

In short, in a no-deal scenario, nothing gets in, nothing gets out until some kind of deal is reached. The whole ""no-deal"" is just BS from British politicians, you never heard any EU's official talk about what it would mean.

What could and will probably happen in case they are not offered a trade deal to negotiate, is that they agree to pay their way out to WTO rules during the 6 months they have left.

&gt;Qobuz se plaint d'un mauvais traitement d'Orange...

L'autre souci concerne Qobuz, qui a publié un communiqué le 17 janvier afin de dénoncer des problèmes de connectivité entre Orange et d'autres opérateurs internationaux, dont NTT et Telia. Cela a mené à des difficultés pour les clients du service de streaming musical chez l'opérateur, « depuis plusieurs semaines ». Qobuz affirme que des responsables techniques d'Orange, « au plus haut niveau technique », ont confirmé les problèmes.

**Pour le service français, racheté l'an dernier, il s'agit d'un conflit entre sociétés sur le paiement de l'amélioration des interconnexions.** En clair, « qui-paie-quoi ». L'entreprise dit ne pas être la seule concernée, d'autres reposant sur le même hébergeur seraient touchées. Rappelons qu'en avril, Qobuz annonçait avoir migré vers Amazon Web Services, le principal acteur mondial du cloud public... dont l'accès est critique pour les opérateurs.

**Qobuz oblige, l'entreprise met en cause la neutralité d'Orange, actionnaire de Deezer**, accusé de tous les maux par le service indépendant. Deezer est perçu comme l'une des principales causes du mauvais état du marché français de la musique en ligne. « Nous nous réservons par ailleurs [le droit] d’utiliser tout autre moyen d’action ou voie légale - mais il y a urgence » lance l'entreprise, comme un appel public à l'aide.

For people who weren't following, the Hague Tribunal for Ex-Yu war was delivering its final ~~verdict~~ appeal, and on 29.11, Dan Republike (Day of the Republic) for dead Yugoslavia. Accident or intention that they left the Croat criminals last, on precisely that date? In any case, the verdict was upheld, we thought they'll take out some uncomfortable parts because ""well they did it for Serbia"", so color everyone here surprised. And then Praljak - the fellow most people couldn't have cared less for a week before this - went like this ""I am innocent and don't recognize this court!"", and he drank cyanide in the middle of the court, while the judges and everyone stares on, clueless.

Shortly afterwards, *Vojislav Šešelj* chimed in with his respect. ""We may have been enemies but this is heroic! PS. Fuck Hague""

What a closing act for the Hague theater.

Her favourite style was wearing a short-ish to medium length skirt together with a Hard Rock Paris T shirt. While not a carbon copy of movie Umbridge it was a similar flavour of weird.

2. She loved cats and owned several

3. Her attitude. She always said she was a super nice teacher and pretended to be friends with everyone when in reality we all hated her for her for how she treated students. 

For each class she would pick a few students that she disliked and she would outright bully to her best ability. In our class her main victim was a boy who was pretty motivated but had dyslexia whom she would find a reason to mock for getting something wrong at least a few times each lesson. I also know she chastised a boy a few graded under me (ten to twelve-ish) with something to the effect of ""Nobody asked you, you little teacher's pet"" when he raised his hand to answer a question. 

Then, when the parents of the affected student would complain to her during parents meeting she would act super compassionate and understanding and her behaviour would get better for two weeks before going right back to how it was before.

We could also never ask her questions on grammar stuff because she would just sickingly smile at us and say ""Well, you obviously didn't pay attention there"" and then later during that same lesson chastise us for not properly having asked questions when no one except a few people got any of the questions right.

2190,"I realised today, rereading [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth's_circumference), that the sun is known to be overhead in Syene because the measure was taken on the one day of the year that the earth's tilt puts the sun directly above Syene's latitude.

The realisation of that hasn't fully sunk in yet.

When last I read about this experiment I was thinking things like ""how do you know it's midday at both places? they didn't have accurate watches at the time"" and that you'd have to set off an explosion at one site, so that it was heard at the other and the measurement could be taken simultaneously.

Presumably there will be more places to the south of Syene where the sun will be directly overhead on other days, but I guess to the north of the the town it must have had a reputation for being ""that place where a stick sometimes throws no shadow at midday"".

To get a flat-earther to accept it's logic and not a trick, you have to get them to listen to you in the first place.

Obviously Europe's fault. Everyone else is too underprivileged to take responsibility for their own actions.

I personally blame John Springford for this situation, as someone so aware of the situation he clearly caries part of the responsibility for this disaster.

&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) assessment, stated that it is not possible to attribute this risk to phosphorus intake in general or phosphate additives. EFSA suggested that the safety of phosphates food additives will be re-evaluated by 31 December 2018.
&gt;
&gt; After a series of loud articles in newspapers about “the end of kebabs and gyros”, the European Commission and the European Parliament reacted to the media reports.
&gt; 
&gt; Susanne Melior, an S&amp;D MEP from Germany rejected on Thursday the notion that the döner was under threat, as the Health Committee raised the objection because it wanted to wait on an EU study into phosphate before green-lighting a change in the law, but not before the findings are released in 2018. “Nothing is happening and no döner kebab is in danger, so naturally no jobs are in danger either,” she said.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; “The draft proposal of the European Commission was not rejected, but received a strong support by member states at the Standing Committee on 25 September 2017, where 24 Member States voted in favour,” said the EU spokesperson, underlining that not a single EU member state questioned the safety of the proposed use to the Standing Committee.

The US government allows expenditures of tax revenue to provide for the general welfare.  There is no legal prohibition on government programs that provide healthcare to American citizens.  Limited programs of that nature, like Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA, have already passed.

I'm sure your own country imposes a duty on you to pay taxes and also uses some of that money to pay for health programs.

You are free to disagree with such programs and to vote and organize against them, but you don't have a right to be free from the duties imposed on you by your government, even though all such duties are coercive.  

Coercion is an inherent part of any government.  Complex human societies could exist without using coercion to compel its members to contribute a portion of their labor and wealth to collective projects.

&gt;if a doctors lets you die cause you don't pay him. he doesn't kill you he just lets you die. it doesn't interfere with any rights.

Imagine if the EU had to collectively decide same-sex marriage for all its member states.

The worshippers in Helsiniki do not have room to practice (the mosques in Helsinki are converted rooms which simply don't offer the room). They cannot fund such a building in Helsinki themselves so they sought funding elsewhere, and found it in Bahrain. The funding would come from the monarchy there. It's unrelated to Saudi Arabia.

I talk a lot to one of the main activisits trying to build this mosque and they don't excuse Saudi Arabia, they want little to nothing to do with Saudi Arabia but they can't fund this themselves, the Finnish government doesn't want to help them and they can't continue practicing in the current mosques in Helsinki because they don't offer enough room.

The main convert, Ms Jardi (I'm assuming this is the one you're mentionning) wants the funds to come from Bahrain.


Anyway with recent rulings Helsinki council basically told them 'fuck you unless you can fund it yourselves it's not happening' which leaves worshippers out in the cold.

2506,"&gt; All it means is that a region or country can decide for itself which regulations it follows and which not. All countries in the EU have the right to at any time say ""Fuck this shit I'm out"" and drop the foreign regulations (as amply demonstrated by the Brexit), they just choose not to because ultimately they consider the benefits of those regulations to outweigh the cost.

That is called a confederacy as I said.

A confederacy is a federation of which all members have the right to drop out at any point.

By this definition the cantons of Switzerland which retain a right to secession are also sovereign.

I'm going to say what I said at the start with regards to the whole emperor vs king and monarch vs president thing in that these terms _have no actual meaning_; they are posh words people in politics through around because politics is all about posh empty words but when it comes down to it what it is is simply a self-identified label. The EU refuses to call itself a confederacy even though it technically is so no one else calls it that. People sometimes saty that the difference between a King and an Emperor is that an Emperor has done a fair bit conquering yet during the British _Empire_ which conquered shit left and right the head of state was still a King and the Emperor of Japan has not conquered anything and Japan does not even call itself an Empire. All these terms are meaningless and purely self-styled; there is no actual definition of ""country"" behind ""I call myself a country and enough people respect me enough to go along with it""",,/r/europe/comments/7h4h31/france_and_germany_have_a_shared_tv_station_to/dqorgse/,cromulently_so,1512273698

""America"" isn't a country in the same way that ""french people"" aren't all the same, but the culture is something that can define a country, its people and its politics, and that's actually what I am attacking there. You say there are people *born long after they had any say in much of the things mentioned*. I agree there are people there trying to change things, and I have hopes in them; but do you really think all americans are victims? As I said before, half of their kid have to recite the pledge of alliance every morning and nobody sees it as fascist. The secession war is one of the worst studied wars when it is so important for that country andyet nobody says anything. They have been robbed by lobbist for decenies and they see it as normal. They privatised the carceral system and nobody bats an eye. They invaded several countries, destabilising nations and killing civils, and when other countries speak against them they call them quitters. They are almost the only ones to not have healthcare system and there are people that actually fight against it. For the love of god, look at the democraticaly elected president!

And all of that is accepted because if not, you are not ""american"" or you don't love america. It's clear that country has something very negative for them and it's their patriotism. As I see it this kind of problem is only a consequency of running away from the ""commie"" tag. And every shit powerfull people have done to that country or to the rest of the world is because of that. Or thanks to that, thanks to the fact that people fear being called out as antipatriotic. They live in a state where you have to follow the main ideology by fear. That is some fucked up shit. And it's some fucked shit nobody's fighting against. Are they dumb or are they afraid, I don't know.

So, indiference? No, I'm actually enjoying that they are getting what they asked for. The painful nuisance from the american conformity when it comes to values is delightful. Mainly because I don't agree with fascist states and fascist people, and I consider american to be it. I just hope someday that the people fomr that nation will change and start advancing intelectually. But until then, yeah, they deserve it. At least it makes them rethink about their country.

The King wasn't almighty by God's Right anymore, a Human-made Constitution is setting the parliament and the King's powers.  

Actually: the separation of powers didn't weaken anyone, it forced every responsible people with opposites ideas and interests to a beginning of negociation before.  

After the revolution, the powers chaotically moved from Absolute Monarchy to a Constitutionnal one.   Flirting with both extremes with Parliamentary dictature and Executive coup d'Etat, tasting both Terror and Communards. Put all their shit together with Bonaparte who focused all those radical opposite through the Empire, to finally lose the Empire but with solid foundations for the Republic.   

After Bonaparte, Constitutionnal monarchy came back but more and more parliamentary.  
The 1815 regime being the most balanced and closest of the French one today, unfortunately ruined by the Empire debts and the economical crisis that lead to starvations and more insurrections.  

When things get slightly better, people had the Emperor nostalgia again, of course Napoleon III failed. Bonaparte was a strategist leader and a General, Napoleon III was only dancing ball politician.    

Slowly but surely, the French people learned the hard way that powers were in their hands, after all.

2643,"&gt;Even in that comparison, to just 2011, it is significant, let alone until 2017.

Sure there has been a big increase in the number of non-white people in London, looks like from 2002 to now that sits at 15-20% demographic change but there were still a considerable number of non-white people in London and the increase in acid attack rates has no discernible correlation with the demographic changes of London and a ethnicity basis.

&gt;What about foreign white ethnicity who are at the same or similar socioeconomic status?

Unfortunately those stats aren't available as far as i can tell, a number of people have put in freedom of information requests but the response is typically that type of data would be too time consuming to put together. We don't have a central database of people like a lot of other countries so much of our demographic stats comes from various censuses which typically avoid economic status on a racial basis.

There have been studies in other countries however, these seem to actually suggest that native people of lower socio-economic status are more likely to be drawn into crime than immigrants of similar status however I would take it with a pinch of salt. A number of UK universities like [LSE have studied if immigration as a whole increase crime on a area by area basis](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/28732/) and their results seem to show immigrants in general are less prone to crime.

But there are a hell of a lot of factors when dealing with socioeconomic which a single study couldn't take into account or accurately measure so I would take research into this topic as more of an indicative guidance rather than evidence.

And the fact that Portugal and Spain barely have any eurosceptic party. Or that Germany has only one Eurosceptic party, the AfD, and counts 12% of the voters, so 88% of Germans are pro EU. Or that the rise of the 5 star movement is due 99% to domestic issues and they are not really a eurosceptic party, because their stance towards the EU changes every second day ( so much so that they wanted last year to pass from a extremely europhobic EP group, the same where Farage sits, to ALDE, the most pro EU federalist group in Brussels)

Partly as a reaction to Napoleon, Prussia unified the little states of Germany under their leadership and attacked France and won. And then took revenge for 1807 by demanding reparations equivalent to 25% of France's GDP.

After WW1 was over, France took revenge and demanded punitive reparations from Germany.

2861,"How dismissive.

I don’t think anyone bar British and Irish redditors understand how nasty the relevant history is. The North is a powder keg and if a hard border is imposed it will uncover things better left at the bottom of the ocean. Violence will spark, even without an excuse the situation can be tense from time to time with intermittent bombing and domestic terrorism. If a hard border is set up this is a reason and it will be used as an excuse to start the violence all over again. It’s a bad state of affairs and the UK and Ireland never really settled the matter. They just covered it with a rug and continued to walk over it and act like everything is ok. Family’s will be physically split, Northern Ireland is Ireland. Some people consider themselves Irish, others British and some as Northern Irish. This is totally fine, but they’re all living on the same land and families are scattered between the North and South. Not so much an issue for Southern Irish but border regions will be forced to endure hour long waits to reach family. Add that to the history and anyone who knows what’s going on will realize how familiar this will become. 

There are also economic reasons why a hard border is going to be terrible for Ireland. Logistics is an issue, Ireland uses the UK as a jumping point into Europe. Ireland uses the UK as an access point and a hard border will isolate Ireland from Europe and have a massive impact on the Irish economy. Plenty of business rely on easy access to the North and South, if a hard border is placed then several smaller business will be forced to close and this will affect local employment rates.


A hard border will be a disaster. The Good Friday Agreement actually had very little to do with the border, in fact it has almost nothing to do with the border. Literally no one had any understanding and it’s becoming very obvious as the topic of a hard border begins to make its ways into the news outlets.

For the second one, yes, you pay an additional fee of about 6€, 59 SEK, to use certain music and book streaming services without affecting your normal data. So if you mainly use these apps but barely use data for anything else this would save most people money rather than pay for the more pricey subscription. 

With the 1GB subscription you'd pay 199SEK/month + 59SEK for 100GB surf dedicated to music/book streaming. Compare this to paying 739SEK/month for the normal subscription? According to Telia 100GB is more than enough to cover 24/7 listening for the month.

They do not in any way limit speed. They have instead provided one free service so you can use certain social media apps without using data and one service, for a fraction of the pay of the equivalent subscription that provides the same amount of data, that let's you listen to music and books.

See, the Papacy had no actual military power. It just managed to convince the most powerful guys in the block that they were God's truth. And they remained God's truth because the tough guys, ie the Franks, said so.

I think I remember a time when the Church complained to Charlemagne, or perhaps it was to a previous Frankish military leader, of their heavy-handedness. Let's remember the Church weren't bad-ass Templar knights yet. They were comparatively pussies.

3028,"Hmm... 🤔. I’m not so sure.

Given, that the map says ‘by publishing houses’ it most likely refers to books published by publishing houses based in that territory and sold into that market. 

Translations don’t automatically count towards a country’s publications (at least, in the way I imagine the data for this map was collected). It depends on rights agreements and on which publishing house or regional office is handling the new translated edition.

For example. If a German publishing house produces an English language edition of one of their books, for sale into English language markets, that book would not (in usual terms) count towards the total number of books ‘published by publishing houses in the Uk’.

That said, the number would include translations for which uk publishing houses have bought the English-language or uk-territory rights to.

Sorry for the long answer, but I felt compelled to write it out, as it would be wrong to think this number includes all English language translations from other languages (as this number would be MUCH higher).

3049,"I’ve never said we paid 42% of the bailout...I’ve specified banking debt since the beginning if you’ll read the above. Not sure what you mean ‘which you can pretend has the same value’? As someone who has invested heavily in shares in BOI, AIB, and PTSB since the recession (well with AIB it was more recent because they only did their IPO recently) and have profited massively, I can say with certainty these shares are not worthless. They have been doing extremely well in recent times. Even AIB has recently gone public and has made many Irish people a lot of money. Anyway, for all empirical purposes, the price paid for shares is what they’re worth. That’s the foundation of capital markets. So you need to stop disregarding these as worthless in your argument and lumping them in with debt.

Also, why are you speaking as if it’s 2007? ‘May turn out to be worthless’? I bought PTSB at 1.86 about 3 months ago it’s now at 2.14, I bought AIB at 4.95, it’s now at 5.44, I bought BOI at 6.80 and sold at 7.20. These banks did not collapse and are extremely liquid on the ISEQ, and according to leading Irish brokers research they will continue to outperform in the future. Looks like they didn’t turn out to be worthless at all, so maybe now you can stop calling them debt. Anglo is dust, the rest recovered well and will continue to do so. 

The government paid what it thought the banks were worth, that’s the bottom line. It’s not up to you to describe this value as fiction, the market determines this and is doing so. Since you ignored my other points about us being forced to take on debt that didn’t belong to us I’ll assume you don’t have an answer for this.

3078,"&gt;This isn't about lefties. This is about how a guy with right-wing tendencies radicalized himself to the point that he took a knife to somebody. Stop deflecting. We probably have thousands of guys like this in the country and they are a threat.

You are right yes, i also didnt have in mind to derail the discussion. I just found the very absolute statements made about the situation to be wrong. Its not just the right violence, its violence being used against political enemies that is gaining traction in the last year. 

&gt; 
But taking your bait(and assuming you will promptly ignore what I have written above) I do know of no dead AfD sympathizers due to left-wing violence. This is the usual deflecting tactic of the right. Also, the Nazi violence problem is a lot older than that neo-liberal party that got taken over by open or covert Nazi apologists.


I didnt hear of a dead Afd member also, and you are absolutely right in saying that the nazi violence has been far worse. And it is an old problem, and it feels like not enough is being done (NSU case was a fkin disaster).

&gt; 
We've had Nazis armed with base-ball bats clubbing kids within an inch of their life to make them stop being left-wing.

Thats why i even bothered. A lot of people on the other side seem to have liked and adopted the nazi methods. Esp. Peooleple on the internet seem to favour violence as a solution. Thats not something we should ignore. 

&gt; So pardon me when faced with this level of dishonesty, I will also take your figure with a grain of salt.

Oh yes, for sure. The numbers probably are not 100% right. Pretty sure they are inflated.

3090,"&gt; I'm pretty sure 1.9 million would be considered ""around 2 million"" by 99% of people. 

Yes but for the Armenian Highlands, not the entire Ottoman empire.

&gt;Ok lets back off for a second. If you believe that there were 2 million Armenians in western Armenia, which is if you thesis is to be believed, that means you believe that there were 3 million Armenians in the ottoman empire at the time. Based off of that assumption, you believe that around 2.5 million Armenians must have been massacred in the Armenian genocide.

That is exactly what I have been telling you all along. [2 million in Armenian Highlands, 3 million in entire empire](http://allinnet.info/news/why-the-ottomans-falsified-the-numbers-of-armenians-in-the-ottoman-empire/):

""Thus, according to the Ottoman Population Census of 1844, there were 2,400,000 Armenians in the Ottoman Empire (for comparison, there were 1,500,000 Kurds throughout the empire according to the same census, and the entire population of Western Armenia was 10,000,000). In this case, the report meant only the Armenians-adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, that is, the Armenian Catholics, the Protestant Armenians, and the Hamshenis were not included in this number. Together with them, the number of Armenians would be around 3,000,000.""

&gt;Based off of that assumption, you believe that around 2.5 million Armenians must have been massacred in the Armenian genocide. Can you cite me a source that says that 2.5 million Armenians died? Not 2.5 million christians, 2.5 million armenians. Based off of that assumption, considering the max number of christian deaths is usually around 3 million, you are literally denying the greek and assyrian genocides in a way.

How does that mean an extra million Armenians were killed? The figures that I am telling explain how 1.5 million Armenians could've been killed and how there are many survivors who were forced to move to modern Armenia or the diaspora. In terms of total victims of the genocide (taking into account those murdered and those made refugees), 2.5-2.75 is probably correct.

&gt;Also the Armenians that converted to islam were not really massacred during the genocide, and patriarch statistics also includes non mainline religions as part of their census.

They were Armenians (and would've rightfully been counted as such before the genocide) that after the genocide forcibly became Turks. That is genocide.",,/r/europe/comments/7gbf1w/a_cartographic_companion_to_world_war_one_in_the/dqny9bw/,HakobG,1512238487

Likewise, OP, you are a bit wrong in the title. The Pope didn't actually crown Napoleon. Oh no the motherfucker was too arrogant for that. When the Pope was about to crown him Napoleon snatched the crown from and actually crowned himself^(1)! he then took the same crown and touched Josephine's head (this is the scene shown in the painting), making it clear that he was crowning her as his wife and empress, not as an empress in her own right.

&gt; In Greek mythology, **Europa** (/jʊərˈroʊpə, jə-/; Greek: Εὐρώπη, Eurṓpē, Attic Greek pronunciation: [eu̯.rɔ̌ː.pɛː]) was the mother of King Minos of Crete, a woman with Phoenician origin of high lineage, and after whom the continent Europe was named. The story of her abduction by **Zeus in the form of a white bull** was a Cretan story; as classicist Károly Kerényi points out, ""most of the love-stories concerning Zeus originated from more ancient tales describing his marriages with goddesses. This can especially be said of the story of Europa.""

tl;dr: Because of the mythological origin of the continent's name, the bull from the story can be used to represent Europe. ",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/7h1uf8/map_of_europe_done_in_fantasy_style/dqnmpfl/,bicycle_repairman,1512223117

3244,"Yup.  And just to be clear to the Bulgarian guy I was responding to, that's intrinsic to having a cell phone at all.  Doesn't use GPS, but cell triangulation.

Well, okay, some countries mandate location sending, like when we call the emergency 911 number, [under the E911 Phase 2 requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_9-1-1)) the phone also sends the location of the phone with the call so that emergency personnel can be routed to the location.  If your phone physically has no mechanism of determining its location, then it can't send the location.  But it's not the GPS chipset sending anything in that case: it's just inferring the location and handing the location to the rest of the phone, and that's doing what your country mandates using something unrelated to GPS.  Galileo would not differ from GPS in this respect: neither chipset would even know that the phone is choosing to send the location somewhere.

There are legit privacy concerns with phones, but as the Galileo and GPS systems work, it's not leaking your location to them.

Slightly complicating things, IIRC Galileo does [support a bidirectional mode where a device can talk to a satellite](http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/Galileo_Search_and_Rescue_Service), and there are some devices that can act like a satellite phone and use the Galileo satellites to receive a message and location for emergency beacon broadcasts.  But that's Galileo, not GPS — the closest non-Galileo equivalent today just broadcasts location inferred from GPS or any other GNSS to some unrelated-to-GPS satellites, and I'm pretty sure that your phone isn't a powerful-enough device to make use of that system: you'd need something more like a lifeboat beacon transmitter and a dedicated antenna.  Also, according to that page I linked, the entire system capacity is nowhere near the passive capacity required to monitor all the transmitter locations out there — it looks like Galileo can only handle 150 emergency beacons per satellite transmitting to it.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7guf0e/bye_bye_gps_hello_galileo/dqnmyek/,vokegaf,1512223549

3264,"&gt; Except this isn't about professionally, it's for consumers.

Eh, small businesses and even big corporations are consumers too... Unless they provide ISP services they will need to buy them. So my example is perfectly valid. 

&gt;In your example consumers would be forced to use Google Maps over their competitors (like Apple maps or Bing or any country specific mapping providers) and that would skew the competition.

So a friend of mine has to use an app which uses the Google API for geo-locating and giving directions. That indeed skews the competition, but not because of the data plan. 

&gt;Since these services tend to be free it's not a perfect example, but in case of Netflix or Spotify it is much better.

Why not ? If your objection is to competition being skewed it is probably even more relevant for free products. 

&gt;Why would you use Google Music or HBO streaming or some other product when you get a clear benefit from using what your ISP has chosen for you? 

Because I already pay for HBO... 

&gt; It would also affect new services from rising up (like Spotify itself was years ago) because competing against a product that has a big benefit from ISP will make it so much more difficult.

3415,"Your other posts are deleted or are invisible so I'll anwer here, I'm sorry for the inconvieneces.

&gt; My only thing against Merkel was that she ruined her reputation as a ""conservative"", with the refugee policies and in actuality she's something of a centrist now forming a ""grand coalition"" with a left wing party.

She is anti-refugee, at all times did she do the most anti-refugee thing possible, not a single one of her policies is pro-refugee, she just got blamed for those who stormed Europe's borders as if she's in charge of Italy's oder Greeces border defense.

She tried everything she could to avoid the grand coalition, but what is she supposed to do if voters don't give conservative parties a majority? In 2013 she tried to form a coalition with the greens but they refused and in 2017 she tried to form a coalition with the Greens and FDP but they refused too. There are no other possibilities for her, she is not to blame.

&gt; I mean how hard is it to change a once war zone, if your argument is that neolibealism has made infrastructure you've already lost this argument here.

May I ask what the alternative to neoliberalism is in your opinion? You don't seem to like Social Democrats or other Leftists.

&gt; There's always fake sources, and bad reporting can happen to ANYONE. They've apologized for the article and haven't edited anything, while many opposition articles don't even bother to investigate or apologize. And even with this stain in their reputation, THEY'RE STILL MORE CREDITABLE THAN OTHERS. Because one story isn't so bad as to say many and in a frequent manner.

It's not about sources, they did not fact check a single thing. It's not too hard to find out where the oldest church in Germany is, it's on Wikipedia and it is also not very hard to do some research on where a church burned down, I mean a simple photo would be enough. Most serious newspapers do far more research and in Germany they have to apologize and rectify their articles if they did something wrong, even our tabloids are better than Breitbart.

&gt; Nobody asked her to play poker with our (as states whom suffer the refugee burden) sovereignty, she should've never opened her mouth.

There is nothing else she could have done, she made the best decision at any point. She also barely talks about policy, she does not open her mouth.

&gt; In the german censorship land, it's never known. And there could be economic reasons why companies don't wanna hire refugees and pay them minimum, they would also have to pay for their health care. And it's not so low when your government collects 45% tax of what you earned, it works for them and for the capitalist way of their plans.

Nothing in Germany is censored. The rest again is a conspiracy therory. None of that makes sense, why would Merkel do everything possible to deport refugees and stop them from comming if she had a secret plan to bring them to Europe?

&gt; BOIIII you've been brainwashed ""Merkel is one of the best conservative politicians in history."" Try to go and look for videos on YouTube criticizing Germany's refugee policy, a Facebook video of people who criticizing everything from refugees to their freedom of speech. You do however have a stasi police, and they've censored so much people by taking their phones, laptops and other electronics. And they had to pay fines also.

Those videos are everywhere and I've seen many of them. Nothing in Germany is censored by the government, you've yet to show me some evidence.

&gt; (The US Library of Congress defines the German gun control system as “one of the most stringent in Europe”.
And professor Christian Pfeiffer of Criminology Research Institute of Lower Saxony also told The Local that Germany’s laws were some of the toughest worldwide.
Germans do not have fundamental rights to bear arms, unlike Americans do under the Second Amendment, and the country’s violent past including the Nazi era has certainly helped to shape the current strict regulations.

And the US Library of Congress is wrong. I know enough people who own guns, it's part of our culture. The most common german festival is not the Oktoberfest but the Schützenfest which is celebrated in every single town and village in Germany regularly. [This is was it looks like.](https://www.google.de/search?q=sch%C3%BCtzenfest&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib0bKd_unXAhXRGOwKHeOHC2EQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=637)

You're not German so I don't blame you that you don't know Christian Pfeiffer, the dude is an idiot and has been a meme for decades. He and his sister are known for saying all sorts of bullshit, they became famous for trying to ban all video games by claiming that ""ego shooters like World of Warcraft make our children to killers"". He is also extremely pro-refugee, he even gave lectures in my school ~10 years ago.

Germany has one of the most pro-gun countries in Europe, only Switzerland, Austria and the Nordics are even more pro gun, all of them are germanic in culture.

&gt; But merkel was chancellor at that time, if she never supported the idea SHE WOULD NEVER BRING IT UP. Even if she voted ""no"" it doesn't really matter, the weight and glory of giving gay marriage is hers to bare.

The chancellor did not make that decision, the parliament did it. She did not bring it up, the FDP and Greens did.

&gt; The marriage is already done, and can't be undone. I'm ok with their version of neoliberalism, because ACTUALLY HAVE A IMMIGRATION POLICY. I only support them because they actually have chances of winning, unless AfD actually wins. Which is a POSSIBILITY! But for the most part AfD is what Ukip is to the British.

Gay marriage is not done yet, the CDU/CSU will challenge it in court and in my opinion they are likely to win because the constitution would change for which the would need a 2/3 majority which the CDU could block.

The immigration policy of the CDU is more strict than that of the FDP.

Ukip is a anti-immigrant anti-EU populist movement, they are new-right at most. The AfD is far-right.

&gt; Dude, you fucking read The Guardian, which ""The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion. The newspaper's reputation as a platform for liberal and left-wing"" please stop lying to me.

Those two things combined make it very hard for small start-ups, since they often only can get to a good standing by either better service or some kind of innvation. The longer the process is to get on the market going, the longer large companies have to adapt to the innovation. 

&gt; Because to me it seems that the already large firms are profiting from the unregulated market, not small start-ups.

No thats definitely not true. Just in an unregulated market (well there basically isnt anyone anymore nowadays) large companies often buy the little start-ups with innovative ideas up. Happens also in regulated markets, but to a lesser extent.

&gt; My only thing against Merkel was that she ruined her reputation as a ""conservative"", with the refugee policies and in actuality she's something of a centrist now forming a ""grand coalition"" with a left wing party.

She is anti-refugee, at all times did she do the most anti-refugee thing possible, not a single one of her policies is pro-refugee, she just got blamed for those who stormed Europe's borders as if she's in charge of Italy's oder Greeces border defense.

She tried everything she could to avoid the grand coalition, but what is she supposed to do if voters don't give conservative parties a majority? In 2013 she tried to form a coalition with the greens but they refused and in 2017 she tried to form a coalition with the Greens and FDP but they refused too. There are no other possibilities for her, she is not to blame.

&gt; I mean how hard is it to change a once war zone, if your argument is that neolibealism has made infrastructure you've already lost this argument here.

May I ask what the alternative to neoliberalism is in your opinion? You don't seem to like Social Democrats or other Leftists.

&gt; There's always fake sources, and bad reporting can happen to ANYONE. They've apologized for the article and haven't edited anything, while many opposition articles don't even bother to investigate or apologize. And even with this stain in their reputation, THEY'RE STILL MORE CREDITABLE THAN OTHERS. Because one story isn't so bad as to say many and in a frequent manner.

It's not about sources, they did not fact check a single thing. It's not too hard to find out where the oldest church in Germany is, it's on Wikipedia and it is also not very hard to do some research on where a church burned down, I mean a simple photo would be enough. Most serious newspapers do far more research and in Germany they have to apologize and rectify their articles if they did something wrong, even our tabloids are better than Breitbart.

&gt; Nobody asked her to play poker with our (as states whom suffer the refugee burden) sovereignty, she should've never opened her mouth.

There is nothing else she could have done, she made the best decision at any point. She also barely talks about policy, she does not open her mouth.

&gt; In the german censorship land, it's never known. And there could be economic reasons why companies don't wanna hire refugees and pay them minimum, they would also have to pay for their health care. And it's not so low when your government collects 45% tax of what you earned, it works for them and for the capitalist way of their plans.

Nothing in Germany is censored. The rest again is a conspiracy therory. None of that makes sense, why would Merkel do everything possible to deport refugees and stop them from comming if she had a secret plan to bring them to Europe?

&gt;BOIIII you've been brainwashed ""Merkel is one of the best conservative politicians in history."" Try to go and look for videos on YouTube criticizing Germany's refugee policy, a Facebook video of people who criticizing everything from refugees to their freedom of speech. You do however have a stasi police, and they've censored so much people by taking their phones, laptops and other electronics. And they had to pay fines also.

Those videos are everywhere and I've seen many of them. Nothing in Germany is censored by the government, you've yet to show me some evidence.

&gt; (The US Library of Congress defines the German gun control system as “one of the most stringent in Europe”. And professor Christian Pfeiffer of Criminology Research Institute of Lower Saxony also told The Local that Germany’s laws were some of the toughest worldwide. Germans do not have fundamental rights to bear arms, unlike Americans do under the Second Amendment, and the country’s violent past including the Nazi era has certainly helped to shape the current strict regulations.

And the US Library of Congress is wrong. I know enough people who own guns, it's part of our culture. The most common german festival is not the Oktoberfest but the Schützenfest which is celebrated in every single town and village in Germany regularly. [This is was it looks like.](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%BCtzenfest)

You're not German so I don't blame you that you don't know Christian Pfeiffer, the dude is an idiot and has been a meme for decades. He and his sister are known for saying all sorts of bullshit, they became famous for trying to ban all video games by claiming that ""ego shooters like World of Warcraft make our children to killers"". He is also extremely pro-refugee, he even gave lectures in my school ~10 years ago.

Germany has one of the most pro-gun countries in Europe, only Switzerland, Austria and the Nordics are even more pro gun, all of them are germanic in culture.

&gt; But merkel was chancellor at that time, if she never supported the idea SHE WOULD NEVER BRING IT UP. Even if she voted ""no"" it doesn't really matter, the weight and glory of giving gay marriage is hers to bare.

The chancellor did not make that decision, the parliament did it. She did not bring it up, the FDP and Greens did.

&gt; The marriage is already done, and can't be undone. I'm ok with their version of neoliberalism, because ACTUALLY HAVE A IMMIGRATION POLICY. I only support them because they actually have chances of winning, unless AfD actually wins. Which is a POSSIBILITY! But for the most part AfD is what Ukip is to the British.

Gay marriage is not done yet, the CDU/CSU will challenge it in court and in my opinion they are likely to win because the constitution would change for which the would need a 2/3 majority which the CDU could block.

The immigration policy of the CDU is more strict than that of the FDP.

Ukip is a anti-immigrant anti-EU populist movement, they are new-right at most. The AfD is far-right.

3475,"&gt; The more regulated a market is, the longer it takes for small start-ups to get going.

I think that is very dogmatic, it completely depends on the regulation. 

Imagine a regulation that new ISPs can't be foreign owned, or have assets more than 10.000.000 euro. These are obviously ridiculous examples, but show that regulations don't necessarily need to hinder start-ups in favour of large, established firms.

Now they usually do, as you rightly pointed out that it involves documentation and compliance with said regulation which have a fixed cost usually and thus a larger relative cost on start-ups with less funding.

However in the above case, we are talking about ISPs offering certain apps to not count against a data-cap. Small app-developers will not profit from this. Instead it will entrench the position of large apps that make deals with ISPs. So you are not talking about that side of the market. That leaves the ISPs. (First small start-up ISPs is already kind of ridiculous) So that would leave smaller ISPs being ""innovative"" by offering cheap packages that limit internet but offer unlimited ""insert App"" because the app developer is paying parts of that cost instead of the customer. Do we really want to sacrifice innovation in the software development in favour of more ""innovation"" in the type of internet bundels for mobile phones are offered?

Your main argument is that:

unregulated market = more start-ups

and I think that line of argument is flawed. Sometimes regulation serves exactly to protect the abuse of power of larger market participants.

Nearly everyone that has studied its problem has agreed that its debt is not sustainable(including the IMF) and should be relieved(something that was applied in Germany in 1953). However the eu keeps pushing for reforms that clearly won’t change anything. 

The eurozone system is flawd by definition. You cannot have the same currency with such different economies. If Greece was not in the eurozone it would simply devaluate its currency and go on with lesser imports. But Greece traded that power when joining the eu with stability and support.

Remember that the vast majority of the money the eu is sending is going to bail out banks. But its the that people have to put up with the austerity measures.

when you look at the UK though, and I say this with a deep appreciation and respect for the european contribution to western civilization, there isn't an amount you can pay them that is going to make it beneficial to its constituency to take part in such a union. They are inherently on the losing end of the bargain because of the disproportionate contribution of wealth, service, and culture.

From my (personal) perspective this went about as well as this type of thread can go and a lot better than at least I initially expected.

Let me explain:

If I look at posts sorted by top right now then [[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7gwj7g/this_is_my_political_and_economic_union_they/dqm8fmn/)] is saying ""I'm grateful for the EU because of what the US deals with right now"" and that set the tone for the entire thread. [[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7gwj7g/this_is_my_political_and_economic_union_they/dqmavvb/)] immediately points out issues the EU has in this regard. [[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7gwj7g/this_is_my_political_and_economic_union_they/dqm8r3h/)] is a meta comment with two of our mods (\*cough\*) joining the train. [[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7gwj7g/this_is_my_political_and_economic_union_they/dqmammj/)] is some more pro-EU masturbating with [[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7gwj7g/this_is_my_political_and_economic_union_they/dqmdqxx/)] again being critical regarding how the EU handles this and reminding us to stay vigilant. 

For the next comments we have some more pro-EU stuff, we're reminded of the linking law in the EU as an issue and zero rating is brought up, the post gets called out as sounding like something from /r/atheism, we have the request to put something like net neutrality into EU treaties to strengthen it, more zero rating, lobbying in Brussels.
_____
The pattern I see is one that has a positive vibe towards the EU while reminding us that it isn't some perfect wonderland and one that doesn't play down Americans as people because of their nationality and instead cites the US as an example for *why* some things in the EU are pretty damn good.

Of course a thread like this attracts shitty people. We've had more than one comment regarding ""but but terrorism"" in usually less nice ways and we've had people calling both Americans and Europeans shit in various ways.

The nature of the beast here is that a comment attacking Europeans as a group will be reported more quickly and more often than one attacking Americans (they're also more frequent, at least in this thread) so I wouldn't be surprised if there's some stuff deeper in comment sections that we haven't seen because nobody bothered to report it.

**If you find comments that are attacking other users, especially based on their nationality, please help us out and report them.**

But *all in all*, especially if we look at what the top responses and those discussions look like right now, I'd say this was a decent thread and our userbase handled it pretty damn well. &lt;3

BORDEAUX (AFP) - 

After years of playing cat-and-mouse with police, a man who punctured the tyres of thousands of cars around the southwestern French city of Bordeaux has finally been apprehended.

The 45-year-old, arrested Wednesday, carried out his campaign of vandalism for six years, planning his nocturnal puncturing trips with the precision of a thief preparing a bank heist.

The man, who has yet to be named, told police he acted in anger against society.

He has slashed up to 70 tyres a night since 2011, choosing neighbourhoods at random around the port city to stay one step ahead of the police.

By his own estimate, the unemployed ""serial puncturer"" -- a nickname he gave himself -- vandalised 6,000 cars around the French wine capital, a figure deemed by police to be ""credible"".

Investigators said they breathed a ""huge sigh of relief"" following the capture of a suspect they have been chasing since 2014 after realising they were dealing with a serial offender.

He had made their life difficult by leaving no DNA evidence and stealthily avoiding CCTV cameras, keeping deliberately irregular hours and routes to throw them off the scent.

What's more, he often punctured the tyres gently so that they deflated slowly, making it even harder to track his movements.

""It might seem like something to laugh about,"" Bordeaux prosecutor Marie-Madeleine Alliot acknowledged Thursday.

But it was no laughing matter for residents who woke up to find their tyres slashed -- or for authorities who were handed 1,100 complaints, including from one hapless motorist who was hit six times.

- Coded notebook -

The culprit meticulously planned his targets in a notebook in which he included details of CCTV cameras to avoid and scheduling his exploits all the way up to December next year.

He even wrote in code, inverting house numbers to confuse potential readers.

He would set off under the cover of darkness, often striking between 2:00 am and 5:00 am before taking the first tram home, said Nicolas Perez, the police officer leading the inquiry.

It was a photo taken by a resident that finally allowed police to catch up with him.

He was arrested at 2:00 am on Wednesday as he was heading out on one of his usual excursions, and quickly admitted to his crimes.

The full motives of the tyre puncturer, who has no criminal record, have yet to be unravelled.

But initial inquiries suggested an ""obsessive and solitary personality"", Alliot said.

Police said he expressed bitterness towards society and a desire for ""revenge"" after being mistreated as a child.

He appears to have been inspired by a cobbler's puncturing tool he found in the street in 2011.

""He wanted to be noticed, to feel like he was being heard,"" said deputy prosecutor Jean-Claude Belot, noting that the puncturer enjoyed reading press coverage of his antics.

He has been charged with wilful damage to private property for which he could face up to two years in jail and a 300,000 euro ($357,000) fine.

His trial has been set for May 18.

Where I grew up in Ukraine, winters were relatively mild but hitting -10C at night was not that rare. Apartment buildings were built terribly (it's a Soviet trademark), horribly inefficient at keeping the heat in wintertime but also heat traps during the summer. Nowadays, you cannot really function in these apartments without AC. If you can at all afford it, you condition at least one room.

Our [ballistic missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGM-133_Trident_II) use GPS for accuracy improvements.

Destroying hardened silos, like [our Minuteman silos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGM-30_Minuteman) requires highly accurate hits from powerful warheads, which are not easy to do without this.

Over the past couple decades, we've spent quite a few resources improving our nuclear targeting accuracy precisely for the purpose of creating improved first-strike capability against Russian missiles in hardened silos without relying on a satellite system.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/more-precise-us-nukes-could-raise-tensions-russia

Satnav systems permit for precise targeting and would permit Russia to have comparable first-strike capabilities.

If we're involved in a nuclear war and the only way to prevent an effective first strike is to destroy the guidance system upon which it depends and apologizing after the fact… it is not a hard choice.

4193,"2/2 **Open letter ""A question of respect""**

We are very grateful to Mr. Beck for his commitment. Unfortunately, however, he is not equipped with the resources to help effectively. As the appointed representative of the Federal Government, he has no choice but to ask donor organisations for help for those affected. This is a creative approach in individual cases, but a representative of the Federal Government should not have to take this step in order to ensure the necessary care for the victims of a terrorist act.

We also strongly recommend that Mr Beck's office be continued after his announced final report. The task of this office is not only to look after the surviving dependants and injured from Breitscheidplatz. This office is required for the permanent coordination of activities in the area of prevention, preparation and communication in the field of victim protection at federal and state level.

The loss of a loved one cannot be compensated by material compensation. The void in our lives will remain and accompany us to the end of our lives. We must learn to deal with it.

However, the loss of a close relative also causes financial damage. Our expectation is that the state will ""climb into the shoes of the victims"" for the families of the bereaved and at least close the financial gaps that the attack will tear. It is our concrete expectation to you, Chancellor, that the Federal Republic of Germany will help our families unbureaucratically and comprehensively and that it will pay for the present and future financial losses.

Compared with this expectation, the extent of the current state support remains far behind. According to the current state of the law, there are three sources of compensation which, in total, are inadequate:

(1) First of all, the survivors of a terrorist offence were subjected to the so-called one-off ""hardship benefit"" of the German Bundestag, which was mentioned above, albeit at a low level.

(2) In addition, there are benefits in accordance with the Victim Compensation Act (Opferentschädigungsgesetz, OEG). Within the framework of the OEG, funeral costs are borne which do not cover more than the costs of the lowest possible funeral. In addition, any pension entitlements under the OEG will be offset against accrued pension entitlements. The rates are so low that there is no entitlement even at a very low pension level.

(3) Finally, funds of the Traffic Victim Assistance (VOH) are available. According to the Traffic Victims Assistance Act, VOH only pays compensation according to a limited catalogue for direct damages. Loss of earnings of self-employed persons and other indirect consequential costs of the estimate caused by the estimate will not be taken into account and thus will not be reimbursed.

The claim bases of the three sources of compensation are very complex and often hard to understand for us. For any kind of support, it is necessary to complete comprehensive applications, partly with identical questions in the forms. Only then is it decided whether a claim exists. However, claims often do not exist, or only to a very small extent. This is very frustrating and leads to extremely stressful situations.

Many of us have faced unresolved financial challenges since the attack. Who pays for the deceased's contribution to the financing of a mortgage? How can someone who had to give up his apartment for financial reasons because of the attack get to a new accommodation without external help, if the regular income of the landlord can hardly be proven to be notable and conditional pensions? What should parents do if they are not psychologically stable enough for their previous full-time jobs, but who would have to work full time for financial reasons? How should single parents organise their children's everyday life with their children when they have to work more than 100% to compensate for the loss of earnings of their deceased parents? Who pays for permanent psychological damage, which even leads to occupational disability?

Chancellor Merkel, there is an urgent need for more comprehensive financial support: On the one hand, there must be a significant increase in hardness performance, as Mr Beck has already publicly called for. On the other hand, pension entitlements must be extended, increased and paid out of financial need. These benefits should be provided to the victims with as little bureaucracy as possible - not only for victims and surviving dependents in Germany, but also explicitly for the foreign guests affected by terrorism.

In addition, the use of road casualty assistance seems to us to be an inadequate use of resources and an unsustainable solution. Recently, your Minister of the Interior reported that a bombing raid was prevented in Germany. The victims of this planned attack would not have had access to the funds from the road accident assistance and the gap in the provision of aid for victims would have been even greater than it already is for us. The question also arises as to why the automobile insurers, and thus indirectly their policyholders, pay for the damage caused by an act of terrorism simply because the terrorist used a truck instead of a bomb?

Fortunately, we have not been left alone in the difficult months. While hardly anyone in the federal government and also in the state of Berlin cared for the injured and the bereaved, for example, the volunteer victim representative of the state of Berlin, lawyer Roland Weber, jumped into the gap. In the decisive first few weeks after the attack, he tried to support the families as much as possible and to compile the necessary information. In addition to families and friends, numerous emergency counsellors and relief organisations such as the Red Cross and, above all, the White Ring have also made extensive efforts for us. They have supported us with a lot of energy and willingness to sacrifice. We would like to thank them and the many generous donors.

Chancellor, unfortunately it is to be feared that the attack on Breitscheidplatz will not be the last terrorist attack in Germany. That is also why we are addressing you with this open letter. Every effort should be made to prevent future attacks and, at the very least, to ensure proper treatment of victims and survivors, irrespective of nationality. The Confederation, in cooperation with all 16 federal states, must learn how to deal with terrorism as quickly as possible. The simple continuation of the current failure of the Federal Republic of Germany is irresponsible.

Even if the problems we have identified cannot be solved at federal level alone, their solution requires the decisive leadership of the Federal Government. We therefore urge you, together with the federal states, to address the problems immediately and to find solutions."".

You own country did cut relationship with Gaddafi before he was overthrown and had contact with the rebels after cuting ties with Gaddafi:

""Prime Minister Petr Nečasdenounced violence against civilians in Libya, saying, ""The bloodshed aimed against the civilian population is an unprecedented violation of human rights and has no place in the civilised world. We are shocked at the brutality of the reaction of the Libyan regime to the civic demonstrations.""[255] On 10 June 2011, The government announced it was considering diplomatic contact with rebel leadership and was also considering aid package. Czech lower house foreign committee chairman David Vodrazka will meet Mohamed Allagi who is minister of justice and human rights in the National Transition Council on 14 June.[256] On 29 June, the Czech Republic recognized the National Transitional Council as a ""credible representative"",[257] but on 29 July, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, ""I may like them, but unless they control the whole country, I will not recognise them officially.""[258] Even as anti-Gaddafi forces took over most of Tripoli in late August, Schwarzenberg continued to say his government was not prepared to recognise the NTC as Libya's government, though he offered its experience and support to the council in achieving a transition to democracy"".

And how what I am saying is nosense if France was crtiticized during the events in Tunisia then foreign minister Michel Aliot Marie lost her position because she sided with the then current authority there? 

But I am talking nosense, sure. The world must be hard to follow for you.

You only need to look at our constitution to see why the referendum goes against the rights of all Catalans and Spaniards.

If you mean the second class citizen part Catalonia would fire anyone that doesn't renounce their Spanish citizenship from public office. Catalonia also denies Catalan Spanish speakers access to public education in their native language (we are the only region in the world to deny such a right to one of our official majority languages) - in fact there is exactly [one public school](http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2017/09/29/59cd42f4e5fdea0d2a8b459e.html) in which only 25% of classes are done in Spanish, and probably the teachers that teach in Spanish there can have their jobs threatened because of that - this makes it so if the main language you speak at home is Spanish your children will on average get worse grades, drop out of school more often and in general do worse in life. It is also worth noting that no public means of communication funded by the Catalan government is in Spanish (even though Spanish speakers are half the population), Spaniards get fined for posting private signs in Spanish (so every business has to be in Catalan) and plain political propaganda against the Spaniards is funded by taxpayer money.

(wikipedia):

Today

Before Christmas 2003, in the village of Marotinu de Sus, a 76-year-old Romanian man named Petre Toma died. In February 2004, a niece of the deceased revealed that she had been visited by her late uncle. Gheorghe Marinescu, a brother-in-law, became the leader of a vampire hunting group made up of several family members. After drinking some alcohol, they dug up the coffin of Petre Toma, made an incision in his chest, and tore the heart out. After removal of the heart, the body was burned and the ashes mixed in water and drunk by the family, as is customary.[citation needed] However, the Romanian government anxious to maintain a good image in preparation for the country's accession to the European Union had banned this practice, and six family members were arrested by the police of Craiova from Dolj County for ""disturbing the peace of the dead"",[11] and were imprisoned and sentenced to pay damages to the family of the deceased. Since then, in the nearby village of Amărăştii de Sus, people drive a fire-hardened stake through the heart or belly of the dead as a ""preventative"".[12] The six who exhumed the body were charged and sentenced to six months time served.[13]

Finland was the last to invade. They invaded the Soviet Union together with Nazi Germany during the Continuation War. By that logic, is it acceptable to use derogatory terms against you? No, because it's in no way justified and I can hardly see how can you find such justifications acceptable. 

By that logic, racism can be justified all over the world on the basis of other countries invading others. 

Why refer to Russians as Ruskies in their own language if not to provoke?

The problem is more that the distribution is complicated. The biggest problem is the not so democratic organisation of GEMA. Also there are GEMA alternatives but they don't have near as much bargaining power as GEMA because they are quite small: https://www.c3s.cc . But also as mentioned before within GEMA artist don't have to much choice about rights management. You also don't have to participate at all - which quite some musician choose especially if they main gigs are at small venues.

For me GEMA is one of the complicated cases where people are just to fast to judge. In reality it's complicated. Also in Germany changes take quite some time (germans are super conservative) - which is not bad. But from my experience musician who actually have to live just from their music are far les critical about GEMA and most criticism is from people who has to pay GEMA - consumers and venues.

If you're talking of white people or those with ''high'' IQ - look no further than the Soviet Union, which can only be regarded as economically and intelectually stunning half of Europe for half a century.

Mate, all people, regardless of skin colour, have the possibility to be productive, to be geniouses etc. Obviously Africa is in a rut right now, no wonder - their economies rely primarly on raw resources. If you're the one feeding China raw materials so that they can make 2 dollar headphones - what do you think ''trickles down'' to the African enterprises and their workers?

The way how different parts of the world have different development speeds can be attributed to a lot of things, including culture, but, in my opinion, primarly, history.

Here's a [more recent map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_dialects#/media/File:Map_of_Ukrainian_dialects_en.png).

The sources for the map are Ukrainian but scientific so there is no controversy (same map + sources are also used by the Russian-language wiki).

While there are three rather different cultures and languages at the three corners, there is some gradual geographic transition of dialects rather than sharp division. 

Some steppe areas like Kuban' (and to lesser degree north of Black Sea) have variable/mixed rather than geographically transitional sub-dialects resulting from mixed settlement of Ukrainians and Russians in the formerly nomadic steppe regions acquired from the Ottoman Empire and its allies in the last ~250 years.

4844,"TRANSLATION

In Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary there is a new sense of self-esteem, resulting from both economic success and attachment to traditional values: family, nation and religion, ""writes Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Thursday.
""There was a time when Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks were considered primitives in eastern Europe,"" writes the author Karl-Peter Schwarz.

Recalls that in contrast to Bulgaria, Romania and the West-Balkan countries, Prague, Budapest, Bratislava and Warsaw have made a successful transition in 2004 and entered the European Union in 2004.

""In the 13th year of their membership in the Union these four countries have become (yet) pariahs."" The gap between the Visegrad Group (V4) and the countries that are in the EU continues to deepen, ""Schwarz adds, adding that one reason The fact that the Hungarians and the Poles, and recently also the Czechs, ""have ceased to choose as the West wants.""

Schwarz notes that Viktor Orban's Hungarian Prime Minister is often mentioned in the West with the Russian and Turkish presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan; Poland does not suffer because of the nationalist conservatism under the influence of Catholicism, and the secular Czechs are asked with surprise as to why they chose the Slovakian billionaire Prime Minister.

According to commentator Andrej Babisz, he won the election as the current president of France Emmanuel Macron - with a movement directed at traditional parties, which - he notes - is called populism. ""Only the pragmatism of Babisa's power is considered a populist, while Macron is considered a politician who has saved his country from populism,"" critically acclaims the author.


Addressing the problem of migration, the commentator points to a completely different interpretation of the concept of ""solidarity"" in the west and east of the EU. Most EU countries have agreed to the allocation of refugees as ""an order of European solidarity"", while the Visegrad Group countries interpret solidarity as ""the EU's commitment to defend Europe against mass migration from Africa and Asia"".

From the point of view of V4, Merkel is in solidarity, but Orban - says Schwarz. The threat of cutting EU funds increases only the resistance of these countries before the quotas are recognized - he adds.

According to Schwarz, the ""new self-esteem"" of countries in eastern Central Europe is based on two premises - material and ideological. ""Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary are thriving economies,"" says Schwarz. The EU is perceived as ""less and less as a chance, more and more as a ball"", he notes.

As he stresses, ""people's minds"" are more important, who have been twice exposed to the ""long march"" to be the ""new man"".

The inhabitants of these countries were firstly ""victims of communist civil engineers"" and then subjected to ""neo-liberal planners from the EU and the IMF."" After the return in 1989 the local Communists ""quickly adapted to the new times"", but continued a long march instead of ""more socialism"" postulating now ""more Europe"", writes the commentator.

""The realities of people living with traditional values ​​- family, nation and religion - treated relics as doomed to death, just like the bourgeoisie and peasantry,"" reads FAZ.

""In Central and Eastern Europe inhabited by self-confident nations, this long march has reached a temporary end. A new era, full of hope and dangers, has begun,"" concludes Schwarz in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

4899,"&gt; [...] but don't expect Europe to subsidise it

This is literally the opposite of what is happening. Why should the US have to subsidize the European military? Also, European countries contributing more to THEIR own defense is subsidizing the US military how exactly?


&gt; We have sufficient armed forces for self defence and nuclear deterrent and that's all we're really interested in.

Again, this is just false. If you actually read the articles I presented to you, you would know this. When European countries tried to lead the campaign against Libya, they found out that they didn't even have the basic military equipment necessary to do much of anything without the US's help([yet another source](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/africa/nato-war-in-libya-shows-united-states-was-vital-to-toppling-qaddafi.html)). Again in 2013, when France (the largest military in western Europe) decided to intervene in the Mali conflict, [they couldn't even move their troops or perform air raids without the help of US transport planes and air tankers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/27/us-military-tankers-french-mali). And before you answer with, ""*That doesn't matter, Europe just needs a defensive force*"" I would like to point out that even in a defensive situation, you still need to move troops. If Russia decided to invade, France would need to move all their Troops over to eastern Europe very rapidly. Something that they are unable to do. Also, if they can't even refuel their own planes in the air without help from the US, how do they expect to provide any air support for their ground forces? Answer: they can't. Not only that, but without the UK, the only real Nuclear armed country in Europe is France.  There are several HUGE problems with relying on France's nuclear arsenal for defense. First is delivery. While France has ~300 nuclear warheads in total, they only have about 60 ICBM's  which they could actually use to target Russia, most of the others rely on being dropped from the air, which as I mentioned earlier, isn't possible anymore for France. Second, there are going to be situations that require military action in which the use of nuclear weapons would be wildly inappropriate. For instance, the conflict in Mali, or a war with some non-nuclear armed state. In short, relying on nuclear weapons is just stupid. 

I also really just want to drive home the fact that preventing an invasion is not the only reason that a country needs a military. People bitch about the US acting like the world's police, but without police, you are going to have to defend yourself. What would Europe do, if some other group out there decided to start pirating their shipping lines? What if in the future Suriname decides to invade French Guiana? What if a bunch of European missionaries get held hostage in Somalia? The whole point is, if you wait until you need a military before you develop one, it's already too late. 

Europe as a whole is completely unprepared to be on it's own militarily. The creation of an actually functioning European military would be a great thing for both the continent and the United States. ",,/r/europe/comments/7glrre/creating_a_better_world/dqlk38r/,Taco_Dave,1512110334

The EU is pretty split on this issue, Russia is quite liked in some countries.

And what about the countries who'd be on the frontline ? Poland, Baltic states, Finland... 

You think they want war on their ground ? Furthermore, who'd defend them ? Europe doesn't have an army, and having Spain and Portugal commit large resources to defend the Baltic states... it's difficult to believe. And difficult to believe that the population would approve (of Spain and Portugal). Furthermore, German army is laughable who could it help ?

It would be an USA/Russia showdown, and one that nobody else would like to be involved in.

4997,"&gt;For one,... In Bosnia, Serbs committed more crimes, followed by Croats, and then Bosniaks. Out of these three ethnic groups, Serbs had and have the largest population, more soldiers, and were better equipped. Statistically alone you were going to have more war criminals. 
&gt;
&gt;So, when all is added up, of course Serbs will have more war criminals in prison and years spent in prison. On all sides many war criminals got away, so yes there is possibility that some Bosniaks committed war crimes and got away with it. It's actually the viciousness and the type of war crimes Serbs and Croats committed that make you known as genocidal people. It seems you can't help yourself but torture, rape, and murder.
&gt;
&gt;Two, Bosniaks fought a defensive war. 
&gt;
&gt;Three, Serbs started the war, in both Bosnia and Croatia. You'll notice, Bosnians and Croats voted for independence from Yugoslavia. Serb politicians and Serb military leaders conspired to claim parts of Bosnia and Croatia as part of Serbia. In addition, they also spread propaganda and fearmangoring among local Serb populations in Bosnia and Croatia. And finally supplied weapons and funding to those Serbs. Also, you should take a notice of the fact that Bosniaks and Croats didn't invade Serbia.
&gt;
&gt;I am from Grbavica in Sarajevo, so I know what Serbs did there. Your people should be ashamed of what was done by your soldiers. After all that your people did you don't belong in Bosnia. I watched as Yugoslav Army and Serb war volunteers attempted to take Sarajevo. Grbavica and surrounding area was primarily populated by Serbs and one of the first ones to be taken. Most of your soldiers were murderers and rapists. 
&gt;
&gt;Overall evidence showed that Serbs committed the most and the worst crimes in Bosnia. These are not just personal claims but evidence used in Hague. I'm sure anyone can easily Google it all if they cared. 
&gt;
&gt;Since you felt the need to point out you are Bosnian Serb, let me share my ethnic background, half of my family are Serbs. Other half was mixed of Bosniaks and Croats.  I've lived in Bosnia and Serbia, and now I'm in the US. One thing that I find frequently among many Serbs is that they think Serb war criminals are heros. Normal, mentally healthy, people don't do that. Appearantly, entire ethnic group can indeed be nothing but evil.

5026,"Last Sunday was the banner that called for ""Freedom for political prisoners."" The City Council of Barcelona had to remove it from its balcony by order of the Provincial Electoral Board, after asking for it Ciutadans, which it considered affected institutional neutrality. And this Wednesday the board has forbidden the consistory that governs the mayor Ada Colau to illuminate using yellow the public fountains and facades of municipal buildings during the election period. In this case, the request to ban it was from the PP municipal group led by Alberto Fernández Díaz, who has asked Colau to comply with it immediately.

The council decided, in a committee vote, to illuminate the sources in yellow as a sign of solidarity with the ex-ministers of the Generalitat and the leaders of the imprisoned independence organizations. The resolution of the Electoral Board gives the reason for the appeal of the PP, which considers, as in the case of the banner, that the initiative violates the obligation of the institutions to be neutral.

The resolution of the Electoral Board prohibits also to illuminate public buildings yellow -something that had not been done so far, but was being raised- during the electoral period. As it happened with the banner, the City Council has 24 hours to appeal the decision of the Electoral Board and will do so: but in parallel must comply with the resolution because it is in effect.

The text does not accept the arguments of the municipality, which argued that the lighting of the sources does not have a partisan interest but expresses solidarity with the families of people deprived of their liberty and asks that they be able to participate in the elections. Instead, the board recalls the debate that took place in committee and understands that the interventions of the councilors of the PDeCAT and ERC show that illuminating the sources constitutes ""a support for a specific political proposal followed by a part of the political parties that present to the elections"", beyond ""a simple manifestation of solidarity"".

The illuminated sources of yellow are about twenty, among which are some as central as those of Plaça de Catalunya or the confluence between Passeig de Gràcia and Gran Via. This show of support with the ex-ministers and leaders of the imprisoned independence organizations began to be applied last Friday, the day after the Christmas lights were turned on throughout the city. The proposal, voted in committee, was the PDeCAT, which won the support of Colau's party, BComú, and ERC. The CUP abstained and Ciutadans, PSC and PP voted against.

From the municipal executive of Colau, the deputy mayor of Social Rights, Laia Ortiz, recalled that illuminating the sources was a decision taken from an agreement voted by the majority and has called ""ridiculous that there are parties that think that changing the The color of a source will restore democratic normalcy when there are people in prison who should be able to campaign."" ""What they can not extinguish is indignation,"" she said.

Alberto Fernández Díaz, leader of the PP, criticized that Colau, ""once again, had put the City Council at the service of independence, infringing the obligatory political neutrality of a public institution"", with a decision not shared by all the municipal forces. ""Colau not only belittles all Catalans who feel we are Spaniards in Barcelona, ​​but also is violating the electoral regulations and violating the obligatory political neutrality of a public institution,"" asserted Fernandez.

Last Monday, after the withdrawal of the banner, the councilor of the Presidency, Eloi Badia, said he did not share his ""substantive argument"" and that he continues to call for the release of the ex-counselors of the dismissed Catalan government and the presidents of ANC and Òmnium Cultural, Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart. ""We have to comply with all the resolutions of the Electoral Board,"" said Badia.

2. History, but how much history do we have for migration? About 5 thousand Turks migrate to the Netherlands every year, and 6k return back every year. It's stupid to assume remigration is insignificant when it can make more than a few % difference. Asylum requests denied may be overestimated, but so are future asylum requests by basing statistics on 2015-2016 peak years. Those probably compensate for eachother. 

3. Like I showed, asylum applications are down in end 2016 which has continued in 2017 with about 50k/month in spring. That's below end of 2014 levels of 180k per 3 months. The high amount in early 2016 was mostly due to high processing times, most of those asylum seekers arrived in 2015 along with the rest.

4. We'll see. It's a fact that the new generation is less tolerant than the first, but on the other hand these people are born and raised in the Netherlands. 

I won't get to live the day that the muslim population in Europe is fully assimilated, but I can live with it staying below 10%. I live in a city with a 12% muslim population which is one of the highest here, and I honestly don't really notice it that much. Spreading them well and making sure they enter more mixed schools, workplaces and neighbourhoods assures better integration and faster assimilation. Let's not forget almost all Europeans have ancestry from all over Europe due to big refugee and migrant spreas before the twentieth century. Yet we are assimilated to our home country. We're all an xth generation migrant. That's why I see it optimistically. It will be interesting to see more statistics in the coming decades about the third generation. Maybe they will be even more likely to get kids with a 'native', or maybe the 1/3 that did was the more secular and well-integrated part and the other 2/3 will forever stay mingling with eachother, just like Roma (in which case I would support more deportations and close to zero migration).

5113,"&gt; We did not turn our backs on Eastern Europe after WWII, they were part of the Red Army which became hostile to us. 

You made a deal with Stalin to divide Europe into spheres of influence. Or have you not heard of the Yalta meeting? I get that at that point, it was a pragmatic decision, but countries like Poland and Czechoslovakia had thousands of troops enlisted in the Allied armies, one entire RAF division consisted of Polish and Czechoslovak pilots, but yet after the war, Allies agreed to let the Red army 'liberate us'. That is something I would call turning your back on us, even though I understand that the circumstances were difficult and everyone just wanted peace in Europe, nobody wanted another conflict with USSR.

&gt; I agree that we are not perfect but I would also say that we are by far the best friend Europe ever had.

To Western Europe - certainly. To Eastern Europe post-89 - yes, absolutely. Of course you're not doing what you're doing for purely altruistic reasons, but at the same time, you're probably the only country in the history that used its moment of extreme dominance (the post-WW2 period) to design a system which would not just primarely serve your needs, but which would also equally (or almost equally) serve the needs of those who'd participate in it under your umbrella.

Any other country/empire in the history that was in a remotely similarely powerful position as you in the post-WW2 used that to force others to participate in a system that would primarely cater to its needs.

You didn't and you continued with this approach in the Eastern Europe as well in the post-89 period. So yes, this deserves massive respect and trust me, I do respect this and even feel gratitude for it. Many people in Europe take it for granted, but the truth is that if you look in the history, it's actually something unprecedented.

But this all doesn't mean that sometimes you don't make compromises and pragmatic decisions for the 'greater good' and sometimes you also sacrifice something for it. Just like it happened to Eastern Europe back in that meeting with Stalin in Yalta.

I think you're thinking of a very specific accent when you think of a British accent. It also helps greatly that most people have prior exposure to that specific accent.

Iberian Spanish and American Spanish on the other hand always have an extremely similar phonology even if some vocabulary is different (I don't even think the vocabulary differences are bigger than in US vs UK tbh).

5206,"Fredrik Reinfeldt thinks asylum immigration to Sweden can be compared to having children. ""What's first seen as a cost will be the best investment of your life,"" he says to Expressen.

Former Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt compares asylum immigration to Sweden with having of children. In an interview in Expressen's ""Bara Politik"", Reinfeldt is asked whether it is reasonable for the country to have such a large commitment, where the Migration Board's last year's note amounted to SEK 59 billion (10 Billion more the the entire Defense budget).

Reinfeldt, as previously said that he does not comment on daly politics, still answers the question through a parable of having children.

- As I said, I try not to discuss daily policy. But I want to emphasize that there are very few who put children to the world who say, ""I'm really doubtful because it's quite expensive to have children, what's that going to be good for? Should you live with these costs in the first few years? There are many diapers and things, he says, adding:

""Those who have a little bigger view know that children grow up and grow up, they get jobs and contribute to society, and one day it turns out that they are helping you. That which was first seen as a cost will be the best investment of your life.

5271,"&gt; A thing like ""russian culture"" does virtually not exist

Actually it kinda does, if you mean Muscovite/Novorgdian as Russian, which it has for most of history. 


Sure, Russia stretches far and wide, and has a lot of central Asian cultures in it as well, especially in it's incarnation as the Soviet Union. However, the brains of Russia have always been in Muscovy and the like.  The people living in the Western parts of Russia see themselves as a seperate group of people as well, 'The Russians.'

Saying 'Russian culture does not exist' would make a lot of Russians incredibly angry, as to them, it most certainly does


Honestly, I am kinda astonished someone even dares to claim that Russian culture is non-existent. Where the hell did you get that idea from? Writers/scientists etc. in both Europe, Asia and Russia itself have written about 'The Russian' for hundreds of years. It is like claiming 'British culture does not exist' or 'Italian culture does not exist,' and honestly, it is safer to argue for the last one of these examples than it is to claim the same about Russians. 


Seriously, where the hell did you get this idea from?

5284,"This isn't quite an ELI5, but I've tried to keep it as simple as possible.

Northern Ireland is [the green bit on this map,](https://i.imgur.com/UTe7tUP.gif) it's part of the UK but shares an island with Ireland.

The UK wants to leave the EU Customs Union as part of Brexit. If this happens, there would have to be a hard border (i.e. manned and with checks on people and vehicles) between Ireland and Northern Ireland. If there is no border in this situation, then the UK cannot have border controls with anyone as every country has to be treated the same by the UK under WTO rules.

A hard border is impractical, as some roads and farms criss-cross the border, and it would be expensive. The ease of crossing between the two countries is also an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement, which was the political settlement 20 years ago that ended The Troubles and brought peace after 50 years of terrorism.

The only alternative to the whole of the UK remaining in the Customs Union would be just Northern Ireland remaining in it, but the current Tory (Conservative) government is being propped up by the DUP who are a NI party that would not allow this because of their own political reasons. If the DUP withdraw their support, the UK government could collapse.

It was agreed at the start of the Brexit negotiations that this issue would be resolved before the UK-EU trade agreement was discussed, however the UK wants to move the talks onto the next stage without explaining how there will be no border. Every EU nation must agree to the talks moving onto the next stage, including Ireland.

There is no easy answer to this problem and the suspicion is that the UK government are trying to brush this problem away instead of dealing with it. 

Ireland is worried that if they allow this, the issue won't be resolved at all before the end of the negotiations and it will just be a big mess. This is their last chance to force the UK to come up with a workable solution.",Future 51st state,/r/europe/comments/7gm32v/britain_needs_to_help_irelands_young_and/dqkvllj/,FordTippex,1512079991
5285,"It's not even up for debate, Finland isn't Scandinavian. It's just that people (even a lot of Scandinavians surprisingly enough..) don't seem to understand what Scandinavia even is. It seems like a lot of people think it's just some geographical place that would be considered Scandinavian regardless of who lived there, that it's a geographical region basically.

It's not though, it's an ethno-cultural region based on the shared North Germanic heritage, culture, language etc. of Norway, Sweden and Denmark. If those three countries were larger, Scandinavia would just be larger as well, as it's in no way limited by geography but by the people owning the land. Had Denmark not lost part of (today's) northern Germany, that would also be a part of Scandinavia, as it'd also be ""the land of the Scandinavians"".

""Scandinavian"" is really just a fancy word for ""Northern Germanic"" and ""Scandinavia"" is just ""the land of the Scandinavians"". The peninsula is named *after* the people got their name as well, it's just a peninsula that Scandinavians live on and nothing else.

When people understand that stuff, it should be obvious why Finland isn't considered Scandinavian. It'd be like asking why any other country isn't Scandinavian. They belong to a different ethno-cultural group, that's why. That's not even something I see Finns denying either, they're fully aware that they're ""related"" to Estonians etc. instead.

Now obviously some Finnish people are almost certainly more Germanic than anything else considering the area's history with Sweden in the past, just like other Finns are probably more Slavic than anything else due to the history with Russia, but the Finnish people as a whole is not a Northern Germanic people, so that's the explanation. As a whole, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are more closely related to Germany, Netherlands, Austria etc. than to Finland.

""Nordics"" isn't an ethno-cultural region though, that's just a northern regional one that can change at will really. There's no deeper ""meaning"" to being Nordic than that you live somewhere in northern Europe. When joking about Estonia into Nordic etc. it's just a matter of perception really. If people start perceiving them as Nordic, they are. There's nothing to fulfill, no application or whatever as ""Nordic"" doesn't really mean anything important on its own.

Either way, I don't get why some people are so concerned with ""making"" Finland Scandinavian. What would that change exactly besides making the term meaningless? Then it's just an arbitrary name used for a bunch of completely random and unrelated countries. And what's the upside to being called Scandinavian anyway? It's just a name for three related people and their countries, what's the big deal about that? We didn't *choose* to be related people, there's no ""achievement"" involved in it or whatever. Why would anyone care? To me it seems as silly as trying to ""make"" France Scandinavian based on their cultural influence of Scandinavian invaders in the past or something..

1) set up costs are often more prohibitive than operating costs

let me give you an example, China couldn't make their own ballpoint pen nibs, so they had to import Japanese ones as they didn't have the tech/capabilities

they had to invest money into getting the ability to produce the actual pen nib mechanism, it would have been cheaper however for them if they knew it from before, and didn't have to rely on imports/investment into ballpoint pen R&amp;D

2) buying in bulk is cheaper than individually, that's a fact, esp with the collective bargaining power of the entire EU

So did Italy, France or Austria. also we did other projects in the region, it was news a few weeks ago that we helped rebuild churches in Syria. Also this program you cited had the aim to also resettle refugees into Europe.

I definitely think foreign languages should be as interactive as possible. Because the best way to learn a language is to speak it and that's far easier in small groups than in a class of 30.

But something like math can work in large groups imo. The way most math teachers do it here is they explain how to solve a type of problem and then have the students come and solve the problems on the board in front of the class. One by one. So of course, a smaller class is better off because every student will solve more problems. But I think it works even in a large group. Especially if you have enough classes in a week. We had 4 hours of math a week in high school. So quite a normal amount I'd say and we were a class of 32. And while most people hated it simply because it's math, they did learn it.

Yes I did make the number up - since I don’t have a copy of Facebook Ireland’s Accounts to hand, I was just demonstrating the types of items that could be included within their P&amp;L to reduce their turnover by such a large amount.

I do really think you’re missing the point of my post. I’m really not making an opinion one way or another, I’m just saying without reading the accounts I really couldn’t judge whether it’s an appropriate amount of tax or not. Comparing the tax paid to the revenue makes for a great sensationalist headline but it actually tells you no useful information

5448,"&gt; I mean, you put the slope there, but there isnt even a muslim party yet

For this discussion you will be going into lawyerism. Their official program is not islamism, but their manifest is explicitly only mentioning islamic education. Their policy has always been anti Israel (even going so far to refuse to [return a handshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YA11hJ5kzY), not very inclusive if you ask me). The examples of freedom only mentions islam, fails to mention any of the other major religions and their dedication to protect them as well. Slogans as 'muslims should be proud on their heritage'.

They have to be sneaky about it, openly coming out as a muslim party might repel other types of immigrants that might want to vote on them, but the general message is rather clear to me and a lot of their voters. Only one mention of other religions in their complete manifest. How is that inclusive to everyone and not just muslims?

It is like talking about everyone should be included in a party, but explicitly and only inviting one demographic to that party.

And for the rest I agree, no party should be based on religion in a perfect world, because humans are not really good at giving a lot of leeway to another and that leads to other forms of discrimination.

Its not like in the cold war where both sides stood still to not get destroyed themselfes. Heres how the scenario the pro gun argument plays out: Trump (or anyone else for that matter) will overstep a line and people will rise against the government. Who do u think will shoot first? People who want to defend their president from impeachment/imprisonment or people who want to defend the democracy. whoever starts it, the other side will retaliate. Now the government has every reason they need to use the military in their own country, to reinstate ""peace and order"". More people will die. The government will not be thwarted, but empowered and has now every possibility to cleanse the opposition.

This argument is a romantic fantasy by americans who like their rifles a bit too much. for it too actually work, the whole country would need to stand united against their government. how realistic is that?",,/r/europe/comments/7glrre/creating_a_better_world/dqkgksk/,IDontHaveCookiesSry,1512065276

5559,"&gt;There are many schools of ethical thought, you cant just say that ""something is [...] from and ethical perspective""

It's at least hardly compatible with our western idea of ethics to favor the wellbeing of your own tribe to that of general society.

&gt;It is pragmatic to help people with problems because it helps to progress science, economy and society, which directly increases your standard and lenght of living. 

True, but most of that applies to foreigners as well unless you value ethnic and cultural homogeneity over economic benefit. You talked about ""weaklings, idiots and retards"" though, which are unlikely to provide benefit to society, regardless of whether they come from our own society or if they have immigrated here. 

&gt;It is also pragmatic to help people who on their own cant make a profit, as they can be the product, increasing the well being of those who are actualy useful by being living proof that their society wont abandon them if the ever stop being profitable.

It can also be pragmatic to accept refugees to have a living proof that members of our own society won't be abandoned should they ever have to seek refuge somewhere else. The more countries are accepting refugees the more it will become a social norm that will spread to other countries and make them more likely to take refugees themselves.

5566,"&gt; Have you heard of Australia's turn back the boats??? Or sending them to the first and closest safe country (which should've been done), most of Arabian Africa is safe including Libya. 

Sending them to the closest safe country only works if that country is willing to cooperate with us and takes them back. Libya used to help us when Gaddafi was in charge, but Sarkozy, the UK and the US including Trump all wanted to kill him, Germany/Merkel was the only western nation in the Security council besides Brazil that that did not vote in favor of killing him. He was the only man between us and Africa, he was our wall. Directly after the massive immigration wave started in September 2015 Merkel did all she could to replace Gaddafi with Erdogan and was heavily criticised for that by the left.

There is nothing we can do other to take them to our own countries if no one else is willing to take them. Libya might be safe, but they don't have a government that we could talk to, Juncker has always said that that's one of the key issues.

&gt; Nobody talks about drowning them, but the EU could've done something with a message to send and if they were nice and followed the rules in the place where they stayed, maybe then we could've let them come.

That's more or less what Juncker said in that interview.

&gt; Making money out of something that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, most European politicians thought the migrants would integrate and work for lesser than your average pole. But after cologne and the other rapes we saw the nature of the migrants, and the politicians who are more pro migrant than citizen.

That sounds awfully leftist. Neoliberalism is a certain school of economics; Thatcher, Reagan, Hayek, Friedman etc are neoliberal economists. [Thatcher vs Leftist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okHGCz6xxiw).

The new years eve rapes and the vast majority of continental European terrorist attacks and plans have all been committed by Northern Africans. Those make up only 2% of all migrants/refugees in Germany and Merkel's party wanted to send them all back from the beginning. Europe did not let them in because they needed workers, we have a minimum wage and enough unemployed Poles and Spaniards, they let them in because we were unable to send them anywhere else.

&gt; Trump has already done so much in days that would take the fucking eurocrats years, why do you think the British left the union?

Trump has done nothing but damaging western society and its institutions. Britain left because they were lied to.

Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country.[10][11][12] **After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically**.[13] Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott[14] while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government.**[15]Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that CIA involvement would set.[16] Classified documents show that British intelligence officials played a pivotal role in initiating and planning the coup, and that the AIOC contributed $25,000 towards the expense of bribing officials.[17] In August 2013, 60 years after, the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) admitted that it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.[18][19] The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out ""under CIA direction"" and ""as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government"".**[20]

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king),[21] to rule more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power.[10][11][12][22] **According to the CIA's declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots on 19 August. Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city.[23] Between 200[3] and 300[4] people were killed because of the conflict. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life**.[24][25][26] Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty.[12] After the coup, the Shah continued his rule as monarch for the next 26 years[11][12] until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.[11][12][27]

Anyway it's interesting to note since then Western military intervention have occurred since the start of the 21st century in Afghanistan in 2001 which is East of Iran and in Iraq in 2003 which is West of Iran all this to reduce Iranian influence in the middle east region. Same can be said of Syria in 2012 which is East of Israel and Egypt and Libya both in 2011 which is West of Israel. Both of which were pro Russian and Iranian.

&gt; VIENNA — Although the European Union is in the midst of an economic recovery, long-term unemployment — joblessness and job-seeking that lasts at least a year — remains stubbornly high in many of the countries that were hardest hit by the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the European Commission’s proposals for addressing the problem are in many cases insufficient.
&gt; 
&gt; Europe needs far more innovative labor-market policies to spur job creation and reduce long-term unemployment, which can be particularly destabilizing for society. As we have seen, unemployment has been an important factor in the rise of populist parties that are now threatening social cohesion, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Eurostat, the statistical arm of the European Commission, ten million people across the EU’s 28 member states were suffering from long-term unemployment in 2016. Of these, around eight million are in the eurozone, and more than a quarter are 50 and over.
&gt; 
&gt; For young people, a university education or vocational training can insure against long-term unemployment, at least when sufficient jobs are available. But for people who are 50 or older, the termination of a work contract all too often leads to prolonged joblessness. For example, among unemployed Europeans 50 and over, 60.3% have been unemployed for more than a year; but for all unemployed Europeans of working age, that number falls significantly, to 46.6%.
&gt; 
&gt; Behind these statistics are individual stories of personal tragedy, self-doubt, despair, and lost faith in society. Consider the case of a 53-year-old chief IT officer with a doctorate who was laid off from a medium-size Austrian company. While unemployed, he sent out hundreds of job applications. But on the few occasions when he was called in for an interview, employers first told him he was “too expensive” or “overqualified.”
&gt; 
&gt; Discrimination based on age, though illegal in the EU, is a routine occurrence. The fact is that the labor market does not work properly for prospective workers at the end of their prime years. But that needs to change if we are going to restore trust in our political system. Those who are willing and able to work deserve support so that they do not end up permanently excluded from opportunities to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; The governments of Austria, Luxembourg, and Greece are at the forefront of efforts to transform unemployed people who have lost all hope into workers with a renewed sense of dignity. In each country, workers are being given a new chance to contribute productively to society.
&gt; 
&gt; In Austria, a new program called “Aktion 20,000” aims to halve the number of long-term unemployed by mid-2019, by creating 20,000 additional jobs exclusively for long-term unemployed workers who are 50 or above. The program will subsidize up to 100% of labor costs, and its success will be assessed according to two criteria: newly created jobs must serve a genuine economic purpose, and they must be a net addition to existing jobs, not a replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; In the three months since the program’s launch, the best-performing pilot region has already managed to reduce the rate of long-term unemployment among older people by an astonishing 43%. That amounts to almost a thousand people who have found jobs through the program so far.
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, Luxembourg launched a program in September 2017 that will backstop newly created permanent employment contracts for long-term unemployed people of any age. Like Austria’s initiative, Luxembourg’s program is focused primarily on creating new jobs that will reinforce and add to existing social or public-sector activities.
&gt; 
&gt; In both programs, savings from lower spending for unemployment insurance and other social benefits will offset a large part of the financing costs. Given that older long-term unemployed workers are unlikely to find another job in the private sector, we believe it is well worth the limited expense to upgrade them from unemployed to active workers.
&gt; 
&gt; As the ministers overseeing labor-market policies in Austria and Luxembourg, respectively, we hope that these programs will provide a model for other European countries to follow as they look for ways to address the problem of long-term unemployment. And, at the European level, we believe that an ambitious but not impossible goal should be added to the EU’s agenda: To provide every long-term unemployed person who is able, ready, and willing to work with the opportunity to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; Under current fiscal rules, achieving this goal will require some flexibility to allow countries with particularly high levels of unemployment to finance innovative labor-market policies and job-creation programs. In the long run, the cost will be well worth it.",,/r/europe/comments/7glseu/putting_europes_longterm_unemployed_back_to_work/dqjy0w9/,moombai,1512043141

5724,"&gt; School closing

That was a phenomenon under the 1905 government mostly. For example in 1880 there has been 1700 pure Slovakian primary schools for example somewhat more then 11%, which was slightly more then the percentage of Slovakian population. Moreover there have been numerous two-language primary schools. Most of the infrastructural developments in the dualism went to the minority lands, because they were voting government (Liberals, Szabadelvû Párt). After the war we had to build new primary schools by the hundreds, because in Hungarian-majority lands the school-population ratio was the lowest in the whole country.

&gt; illegal to speak in minority language

There was never such a law in Hungary under the dualism, not even under the 1905 government. In fact the 1868 law, which was never overruled, compelled both courts and municipalities to conduct business in the respective local language too, if a member of a minority was involved.

&gt; having no voice what is going on in your land

The electoral laws disenfranchised most of Hungarians as well, the average Hungarian got no more voice than the average Slovakian.

&gt; mass deportation never happened cause it was just population swaping for magyars

My grandparents were taking part in this swap. All of their property have been confiscated, they were expelled from their homelands, and they could keep only the clothes they were wearing. Meanwhile, the Slovaks moving to Slovakia were volunteers, and they could take their belonging with themselves. It was mass deportation on your side.

&gt; forbiding language use completly = no

Something, something 2009

&gt; intentially underdeveloping minority region = no?

Actually as I already told above, the opposite was true, most of the infrastractural developments (railroads, schools etc.) went to minority lands under dualism, because they were voting government.

And culture should be criticized there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. My culture has been criticized for almost everything it has done in the past and is currently doing, why don't I get a bunch of American liberals jumping to my defense and helping me out?

When talking muslims/christians/jews or other religions, it is impossible to separate culture and religion.
