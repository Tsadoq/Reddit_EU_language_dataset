16,"What was need was a clear goal and timetable. If in 2001 the US had a clear timetable far better results could have been archived. Instead the US was always one foot out the door, one more year and job done. This approach resulted in over reliance on established local power brokers which were way too corrupt. If in 2001 the US government had decided to stay for 20 years they could have made sure a new generation of educated Afghan leaders rose to position of power. 

People like to talk about Afghan ""tribalism"" as though it was some unchangeable force. It's not. Tribalism is powerful because people have no alternative. You are either with your family, your village or you are on your own. If an individual can't really on the state to protect them they are going to rally on their family.

That's the beauty of geopolitics. Nothing is permanent.

&gt;As for making their economy float, they literally don't care. Again, they are not the west. The powers that be in Afghanistan would rather the country be in the stone age, as long as they have the power.

Look I don't know what their actual goals are.

181,"Having enough gas would Ukraine import it from Russia?) Obvious question but the answer is that 80% of the total gas consumption in Ukraine is from imports. That's why even after the conflict started Ukraine began to buy Russian gas from others, like from Turkmenistan, and from 2014 started to import from Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary, but it's still Russian gas. Having its own capacities does not make sense, right? So why Ukrainians have not built the infrastructure specifically for gas production? Maybe because there is not enough gas and economically it is not that profitable than buying the same Russian gas from others? Ukraine also started to get gas from coal, but again, it's not enough. The thing is that having natural deposits of the gas and getting it other ways will not cover the country's demand for the gas. 

Oil also comes from Russia, because again, Ukraine does not have enough in its deposits to cover the demand.

About the economy: Ukraine has really great high technologies in building space rockets, aviation, mining, and agriculture. But, the only sector that is developing is agriculture, which is the least profitable in every economy.

I was born in Krivyi Rih, and I have a grade in Mining technologies, so I visited a lot of places where its actual production and in most of them there is old equipment that was repairing since the 80s, and the whole income goes for the oligarchs, people are having low income and due to corruption the city gets low income from those factories and not develop its infrastructure. 

The only high profitable sector is Information technologies which are developing as well, but a lot of specialists from that one are leaving the country because they can have more in other countries, the level of life and security also worth a mention.

Other sectors are in deep stagnation, it's a huge lack of investments because of the corruption risks for the big investors.  

That's why for Ukraine it's hard to stay fully independent, that's why there are big risks to become someone's puppet again(Belarus is a legit example over here).",,/r/europe/comments/p47bxt/today_near_president_office_in_ukraine/h903hgt/,TonyFomitski,1629008015
182,"”Better customised trade agreements can benefit UK manufacturers. It's not like the UK has the full breadth of industries that the EU has, that is an advantage when it comes to negotiations.”

What benefits you might gain from customising those deals (so far none from what I’ve seen) are dwarfed by what you had while negotiating when belonging to EU. So strike and miss here.

”Depreciating pound is good for exporters.”

That’s only half of the picture as you need to buy most of the raw mats from outside UK, like petrol, so weak pound is also working against you. But you do have a point here, I give you that.

I have zero knowledge about wind power industry, so can’t really refute any of that.

”lessening the trade imbalance between the EU and the UK as UK companies need to do paperwork to access the EU while a number of EU companies dont bother because they have a more convenient market. This one may be responsible for the improved trade balance we are seeing now.”

Thats only 61%, making my point about the GDPR only applying to EU citizens relevant even if you convince yourself that this is strictly about Europe.

245,"If you view WWII as some event that occurred in a vacuum between December 7 1941 and August 15 1945, sure. 

However, you are totally ignoring the fact that:

* The USA had been supporting the Kuomintang in China long before the Pearl Harbour attacks

* the USA had embargoed Japan in response to the Japanese invasion of Indochina, which itself is a clear act in support of the Chinese 


* the USA had already begun withdrawing from the Philippines and agreed that they'd be an independent country. There's a reason why Filipino collaboration with the Japanese was minimal, while resistance was fierce (and collaborative with the US when they returned in 1944).


* Outside of the Pacific, the USA had been supplying the UK since 1939 as well, and Pew Research Centre's polls indicate that the supermajority of American citizens in 1939 were already strongly pro-UK and pro-France.



&gt;They obviously weren't feeling it otherwise

What gives you that impression? The USA was quite clearly ""feeling it"". Marines were all volunteers and endured all sorts of depravities in their battles against Japanese troops, and they were still quite willing to take the fight all the way to Tokyo if ordered to do so. 


&gt;it's still distinctly possible they dropped the nukes merely to stop the Japanese surrendering to the Soviets.

Truman had no clue what the Imperial Council was thinking when he dropped the Atom bombs, as far as the USA was concerned they had simply ramped up the strategic bombing campaign that had already destroyed Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, etc. Hiroshima and Nagasaki could be destroyed by 1000 bombers or by only 1, either way they'd be destroyed by air. [As for the fears of Soviets; the USA was actually preparing to *assist* the Soviet Union in invading Japan, going as far as to plan the loaning of American ships to the USSR so that they could carry out seaborne operations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hula).

&gt;""As part of MILEPOST, the Chief of the Soviet Main Naval Staff, Admiral V. A. Alafusov, and the deputy commander of the U.S. Military Mission in Moscow, Rear Admiral Clarence E. Olsen, agreed on 20 December 1944 to **a list of a dozen types of ships and aircraft the United States would transfer to the Soviets**. Among the ships were various types of escort vessels, landing craft, and minesweepers. Olsen also recommended that a ""program for training of personnel and for delivery of some of each type of ship should be set up at once"" so that** Soviet crews could receive instruction from American personnel in the operation of the ships and craft** transferred to them.[4]""


Japan indeed probably surrendered because of the Soviet declaration of war, not because they believed the Soviets could actually invade Japan (they couldn't, the Soviet Navy was too small and underequipped and both sides knew that), but because they had been banking on the idea of having the USSR be a ""moderator"" in a negotiated surrender with the Untied States.

No, it isn't. My initial claim stands.

Some Maya sources report the presence of diseases in the Yucatán peninsula as early as [1518](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/180.html),

You called these Mesoamerican states ""weak."" Weak in what sense? It's been established since many years now that smallpox and measles [played a crucial role in debilitating Mesoamerican populations.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-smallpox-devastated-the-aztecs-and-helped-spain-conquer-an-american-civilization-500-years-ago) And even then, with the help of vastly reduced populations, the Spanish struggled to conquer all of Mesoamerica. They took [nearly a hundred years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_Pet%C3%A9n#Fall_of_Nojpet%C3%A9n) to defeat the last Maya kingdom.

To be isolated from society and looked at as a monster by everyone the moment you open up about what you think?

Does it feel worth it to have tied your ankle to these ideas and the other idiots desperate enough to belong to something that they fell for the oldest trick in the book?

I could debate you.

I could quote pages upon pages of peer reviewed studies proving that you're full of it. 

I could write down an essay's worth of info to tear down your claims.

I could even appeal to reason or to common human decency.

But I'm not gonna do any of that, because hundreds of others have already done so on countless other threads, on TV, on the News, on political debates...

If you wanted to, you would have already heard all of those things. But you don't

Because all you people want, all YOU want is to feel validated. To come here, spout your bullshit, and have someone call you out on it, just so you can close your ears and pretend that in doing so, you're beating them.

Because its not your fault that your ideas are unpopular. Its not your fault that society sees you as danger, an outcast, an embarassment. Of course not!
They're all brainwashed, you see. They aren't smart enough to understand that they're being misled, clearly that's the only explanation. Either that or they're criminals or reprobates themselves.

It couldn't possibly be that times are changing.

And you are not.

Want some advise?

I sugest you take the time to look and smile at any camera you see from now on. It will give future generations better material to put on history books.

344,"To start off what the commenter you were replying to is saying is actually very half-true.

 Im not gonna say it's complete bullshit as it has some truthful elements but the idea that serbs ""must cleanse the regions of the impure in their holy land"" is completely false. I understand where the idea is coming from and there are several different ideas and motives that could be reconstructed as playing into that idea by the uninformed but the conclusion how its our holy duty to cleanse the region of all non-serb elements is very false. The commenter is likely croatian or bosniak or heard this from croats as its kind of in line with how hardcore croatian nationalist authors (actually just one guy i think hahha) interpret the myth but there was never any mention of any impures or sins, at least not in the modern day version of the myth that is relevant and influential today (what i mean by this is its a myth and changes over time, i don't know how any of the historical versions of the myth might've been different i know the version that is relevant today). 

The idea that the Kosovo myth is in ways our religion is actually pretty true

Ok as you can see by my previous comment in the other thread I'm obviously gonna write you an essay so not to bore you pick what do you want to know: 

1. Kosovo myth detailed 
2. Kosovo myth basics + general cultural and historical significance of the region and its very central part in serb national identity and religion
3. **Very** brief history of Serbian-Albanian relations and post-medieval history of Kosovo and how Albanians became the majority (i don't know much about this other than the basics but probably more than most serbs and certainly more than foreigners)
4. Relevance to ""Turks"", and Serbs - Islam historical relations 
5. How the wider breakup of Yugoslavia played into all of this
6. Related to 5. - How Serbs view the conflict and why we feel we were the ""victims"" (mostly analyzing our views of international response and narrative)
7. How we perceive the recent and current situation in regards to inter-ethnic relations and why many are terrified of recognizing it (but tldr our people and cultural heritage are gonna be in trouble)

Pick any amount you want but if you pick several or al,l promise to actually read all of it as its going to be a dissertation basically (obviously i like writing and i really like this topic)

Side note I can't give you much information about the war itself and what actually went down as i wasn't born back then and i never cared enough to look deeper into it, and I also don't fully trust neither serbian nor western sources

542,"What is happening in Afghanistan shows just how much the West failed. We basically did nothing of substance. We never had a plan.

But one thing is important to keep in mind:
In Afghanistan, 75% of the population are basically rural peasants living in a tribal society.

The Taliban is essentially the ""political party"" that represents the tribal chiefs.

The West only managed to secure the cities and lead to development there because for us development happens in the cities and spreads to the countryside from there.

But with such a huge population living in the countryside, to the point it's more comparable to pre-industrial Europe, this strategy was always doomed to fail. What the West would have needed to do was break up the entire tribal society and... good fucking luck with that.

The reason why the Tribal chiefs employ the Taliban is simple: progress means a reduction in their power. A modern nation means no more tribes but a centralized government. Women being equal to men also means a loss in their power. Religious equality mans a loss in their power. Secularism is a loss of their power, etc.

Keeping the country a tribal society forever is in their interest. And for that the country needs to be ""frozen in time"" and all outside influence needs to be rejected and destroyed. It's not unlike 17th century Japan with their [Sakoku Edict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku_Edict_of_1635).

The Afghanistan army folded because it was always corrupt to the core and most important: never paid their soldiers. Why fight and die for them if you can't even earn a living?

Not too long ago, group of girls decided to sue one production company, accusing them of ""forcing them to sex"".

The company was absolutely chill about it. ""We have the whole contract signing filmed, they knew what are signing into, nobody forced them"".

That was the last time this case appeared in the news. I guarantee you, if the court ruled in favor of the girls, the news would report it.

Besides, I know few girls which were on porn castings. Nobody forced them.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen. It definitely happens in prostitution. But in professional porn it's rare.

That all seems fairly cut and dry to me. Yes the later troubles of the 1960s-90s were a very complicated conflict, but that does not negate the fact that Britain did awful, awful things. Why cant you just admit that Britain did tremendous wrong in Ireland? I have no problem listing the awful things that Ireland did. The industrial schools, the magdalene laundries, state help in covering up church sexual abuse, Tuam mother and baby home scandal, nuns trafficking unwed mothers' babies to rich American families.

Remember that in the previous 2-3 centuries Cossacks were often protecting southern PLC, southern Russia, and sometimes Romania from the Crimean and Nogai slave raids (as well as Ottoman invasions). That piracy was mostly against Ottomans too.

Cossacks surely raided others for plunder in 15th-17th centuries, but so were the neighboring powers. Lisowczycy were as bad as Tatars.

Anyway, raiding was almost nonexistent in the 18th century and it was definitely over in 1770s. Catherine II was not doing anything related to justice or stopping raids. She was merely consolidating power, and screwed the Cossacks over as soon as Crimean Khanate was no longer a problem.

771,"Yes as I explained it does in some (mis)translations, what is the root of the eastern orthodox bible scriptures? But even these do not show pride as the ""worst"" sin, a curious detail to omit.

I find it so strange that something that you consider a foundation in your beliefs you cannot point to a single verse that supports your view, which is why I wondered what you're basing this belief on? Considering there are 3 other instances where the bible explicitly describes the ""worst"" sin and makes no mention of pride.

Again I'm not cherry picking I'm quoting from a scripture that you claim to believe in, and not at all out of context. You have scores of tales that mention pride as a sin, but not the worst sin, which is my original point (look at my first question: is this your personal view or a religious view). Are you basing worst as its frequency... Which I still do not believe it would meet even by this measure. Again those tales are about the sin of pride, but do not describe in them that pride is the ""worst"" sin.

As I mentioned before there is no biblical reference in that wikipedia article that shows pride is the worst sin, so I'm unsure why your choosing to reference wikipedia over the absoluteness of the bible which you seem, from your original statement, so confident in. 

&gt;as long as you acknowledge that feeling pride is a massive danger to both you and those around you.

You have to believe that as its the belief you've chosen but I certainly do not, these are *your* beliefs not mine...I'm curious as to how you came to the conclusion that because you believe something I too have to believe in the same thing.",,/r/europe/comments/p46q30/second_pride_march_held_in_sarajevo_bosnia_and/h8xoi26/,TrickyContribution72,1628963455

“Are you supporting vietnam or Iraq”- I was not old enough to have an opinion on either of those when they happened.

Any source for that? Aside of Stammtisch talk?

The job risk is simply not worth it for many people with well paying jobs in my opinion. 

Become German member of Parliament, get 120k gross, 70k net, 50k net after paying the party dues, be available all the time, go to every bullshit event in your district, spend 70h/week in politics, be voted out after after 4 years due to political randomness, try to find a job in your profession after 4 years doing something completely different.

846,"The source is not ANF and your copy paste attacking and attempting to discredit them just reveals your agenda here more than anything.

Even if they were to have reported on this story which they mostly like have, what you can't discredit away is German authorities going around telling Kurds to be careful because the Turkish regime may have sent or will send thugs (or hitmen) after them. The irony is then you're attacking a source that is revealing the truth.

This little act of trying to somehow reveal ANF was amusing though. Coming from a Turk (checked your profile) talking about press bias, even more hilarious. Lets break this all down. Press freedom does not exist in Turkey so it's a bit like throwing rocks from a glass house. Turkey's fully bias, government controlled media are basically one sided when it comes to any matters involving Kurds. I wouldn't be surprised if this story wouldn't even be told in Turkey.

&gt;And their ""journalists"" wanted by Interpol what a newspaper lol

Quite deceiving, it wouldn't have anything to do with abuse from turkey and making Interpol requests that later on get dismissed and turkey looks like the usual crappy regime with unwarranted access?

&gt;On 15 December 2016, French-Turkish ANF journalist Maxime Azadi was arrested in Belgium after Turkey issued an Interpol Red Notice for his arrest. The ANF appealed for his immediate release.\[12\]

So there we have it.. [Out of context claims](https://www.france24.com/en/20161222-turkey-eu-kurdish-press-french-journalist-arrest-belgium), something that happened in 2016, pretty much a year after turkey was blowing its capital up during the coup and then taking the opportunity to go after Kurds as an excuse. Maxime Azadi was released after that, Turkey looked like a joke and Interpol requests now days by Turkey are looked at carefully.

904,"I’m not sure you understand the geography of Afghanistan. China is linked by land only by the narrow mountainous pass in the north east. This is easy to defend against an invading force. Tajikistan   is also mountainous and hard to invade from. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan could be used to stage invasion, though all equipment, men and supplies would have to be airlifted into these landlocked countries. Either way invading forces would only get so far before they hit serious mountains. I think they call this tactical withdrawal. China the same thing with the Gobi in xinjiang. 

China could use Pakistan to stage an invasion but the only way into Afghanistan is via the kyber pass. They could come invade via the desert to the west of Quetta but this area is barely controlled by the Pakistan. Iran could enter the fray from the other side. Or could aid them. 

India certainly wouldn’t aid China, and wouldn’t allow their airspace to be used. I’m not convinced that Tajikistan, Uzbekistan nor Turkmenistan will also be that receptive of China. Though Tajikistan is also trying to keep a lid on their Islamic extremists too. So maybe China and Tajikistan governments aims will align. 

Ultimately I don’t think China will want to invade Afghanistan. They will want to keep friendly relations with Pakistan due to their need to for the belt and road connections to the southern Pakistan port city of Karachi. 

I think China and the taliban will keep friendly relations with each other for quite a while yet due to the taliban needing the economic links with China, and China needing to keep Pakistan sweet.

1184,"Comparing the Ustase, a reactionary nationalist force , and their limited crimes in 1941, to the German Nazis and Italian fascists, who waged multiple genocides to simply expand their borders and subjugate foreigners, is holocaust denial. Cultural appropriation of the holocaust and the unquestioned association of the ustase with fascism was the goal of Tito's fascist regime and has been the goal of Serbian nationalist lobbies since the 90s. The facts haven't changed.

I had relatives who were imprisoned in Jasenovac and know much more about the work camp than you do, both from reading as well as from the accounts of those relatives.

It is important to note that you did not perform original research on anything, and never have (and likely never will). You do not know how to perform original research. You are semi-literate, confusing empty narrative devices and emotive social and political commentary delivered in academic prose for fact. It's why your Reddit comments have so many literary embellishments and read like a children's novel, and you are so easily worked up over somebody pointing out very basic flaws in your reasoning and conclusions, which is not suppressed but in fact dominant, and which had the backing of the Yugoslavian state since the defeat of the NDH and the institutionalization of anti-NDH brainwashing in all schools throughout Yugoslavia (as well as the whitewashing of Tito's own Nazi collaboration in B&amp;H taking the form of collaboration with bloodthirsty, rabid genocidal Chetniks in eastern Bosnia in 1941 and 1942).

Jews did not murder German bankers, teacher, social and cultural leaders, politicians. Serbs had done all those things to non-Serbs over the course of decades, and oversaw repression comparable to today's Myanmar.  
Croatians were the victims of the inter-war period, and they were right to mobilize and resist Serbian encroachment to prevent a genocidal catastrophe that had occurred in Kosovo during its bloody annexation or in Macedonia where rabid Serbian militants were waging a war against the IMRO, ethnically cleansing Bulgars and Macedonians. The specter of this happening, as well as the failed peace negotiation efforts of ""moderate"" Croatians.

The historical context is that Serbs were waging a war of aggression and Croats had exhausted options to resolve the conflict non-violently.

Contrary to Yugoslavian propaganda, by 1942, reforms were introduced that permitted Serbs and Orthodox Christians to live more or less freely in the NDH and even to join the government and armed services. Courts had been established compensating victims of unauthorized massacres, and the death penalty was the punishment for the murder of civilians, in theatres of battle were Serbian militants, insurgents and terrorists were waging genocidal war on the Bosniak and Croatian civilian population of the NDH. Moreover, Serbs and Orthodox Christian Croatians had direct representation to the Poglavnik.

Your fascist ideology and relativization of Serb/Yugoslavian crimes are also why your dissenters are so easily pigeonholed by your preconceptions of who they are or who they must be, as if questioning the narratives of the fascist Yugoslavian state as they concern the sole competitor for sovereignty over Croatia, and in fact the only party that credibly resisted them, implicates one in sympathies for fascism, or questioning the accusations of racial abuse and persecution from parties that are putatively considered to be the perpetrators of the worst genocide in history. You are irked by somebody who isn't a nationalist, fascist or racist challenging your false accusations against the NDH and the bases for those accusations.

No sensible or reasonable historian would touch the reports of the Italian fascists and the German fascist occupiers without conducting source analysis and considering the historical context, which would promptly reveal occupation, contempt of these people for the locals, institutional support of both the Germans and the Italians for the remnants of the Yugoslavian regime on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia. A conflict of interests means bias.

The problem of an occupier rendering a verdict on the conduct of the occupied aside, the methodical and industrial-scale atrocities involving the murder of children, unpunished, medical experiments on infants, over many years, on part of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany means that they forfeit any right to credibly accuse the NDH of the atrocities they routinely committed.

You gave nobody a reason to believe that the reports by the Italian and German fascists and occupiers of the Independent State of Croatia should be taken at face value, or that their authors were credible or sincere, and I gave plenty to explain the absurdity of appealing to the imaginary moral standards, which they did not have. 

This is where the Yugoslavian narrative immediately falls to tatters, when its exponents come to the realization literally all accounts of the ""atrocities"" of the Independent State of Croatia rely on the accounts of people they consider fascists.",,/r/europe/comments/mmqpwu/croatia_to_ban_ustashe_fascist_nazi_and_chetnik/h8w78y6/,Dull_Impression_9831,1628934858

&gt; Do you like Muslims in your country generally speaking

Well, considering our country is predominantly Muslim, yes. However, our type of Islam is very different from the Arab/Turkish type. Generally speaking, people are very secular, and only a few actually practice their religion. Most of us are only Muslim by name. People go out to bars and clubs, drink alcohol, some eat pork, etc. So unless you knew beforehand, you wouldn’t really recognize we’re Muslim. Plus, I’ve seen way more hijabs in places like London and Paris, than in my country. As far as I know, Albanians are the only nation in Europe to never have a religious confict with each other. Even though we have 3 main religions (Islam, Catholic, Orthodox, and some smaller Islamic sects) people live with each other without any religious conflict.

Cortes didn't free Aztec slaves when he showed up.

""Early in his expedition to Mexico, Cortés was confronted by the Maya at Potonchán.[39] In the ensuing battle, the Mayas suffered significant loss of lives and asked for peace. In the following days, they presented the Spaniards with gifts of food and gold, as well as twenty enslaved women, including Malinche.[56][57] The women were baptized and distributed among Cortés's men, who expected to use them as servants and sexual objects. [58][54][59] Malinche was given to Alonso Hernández Puertocarrero, one of Cortés's captains.[54] He was a first cousin to the count of Cortés's hometown, Medellín.[60]""

1404,"&gt; If you earn €2000 net(!) for 40 years, you pension would currently be €707.

What did you assume when you made that computation? If I'm assuming a single, € 2,000 net corresponds to an annual gross income of € 36,700. € 36,700 is 90.5% of the average gross income of € 40,551 used in the computation of the earned pension entitlements. I.e., that example individual has earned a monthly pension of 0.905*34.19 € in that one year. 

0.905*34.19 €=30.94 €. Multiplied by 40 gives a total of € 1,237.68/month, of which at least € 812 will be tax free. Some of the remainder will also be tax free if the person reaches retirement age before 2040. 10.6% mandatory insurances is € 131.20.

For example in 1968-1970 the most prestigious university of the country, KU Leuven, was rocked by student protest that demanded the French part of the university be kicked out of the university proper. This came down to a lot of animosity between the Flemish students toward the Walloons, and the Flemish feared French language expansion in the region which was Flemish till then.

The student riots and question on what to do with the university led to the fall of the government when their attempt at compromise failed. The next government split the university, and forced the French part to relocate to new campuses in Brussels and Wallonia.

&gt;1. All the natives that died from the spanish would have still died anyway from human sacrifices, war or canibalism, the brutal Aztecs even fought to wound and kidnap for torture, food or sacrifice not just kill an enemy...pure dystopia.

Human sacrifices were rare, because it was a ritual to keep the sun coming out, and it was once a day, less people would have died if the Spanish hadn't genocided anyone. War wasn't as deadly as the conquering and cannibalism wasn't practiced by any large nations, Acaxes did but they weren't around to meet the Spanish. The Aztecs weren't any more brutal than the Spanish, coming and slaving over half of a continent is dystopian.

&gt;2. If you were a native american, which you arent, you d be wearing an animal cloth and have a wooden stick between ur balls...the internet, electricity, the pc and all the comforts actual native americans now enjoy would be gone, they d be enjoying that tribal life, until the Aztecs decide to rip their hearts from their chest while their still alive, is that what u want for them?

First off, I said I'm half Mayo, which is a group from the Sinaloa Sierra, so apparently you know what I am better than me, because people on the internet are what you want them to be apparently. Everything else you said really shows how you know nothing about history of the place, aside from warfare, Europeans weren't advanced, and most of those inventions would have reached the whole globe due to globalism. More people died both proportionally and in total from European religions, so I don't see why you keep bringing up sacrifices as such a big thing when during the Protestant reformation 40% of Germany was murdered.

&gt;3. holding a grudge for something that happened in a different time, with different people in a ""different"" world over something that never affected u is dumb. It's like me holding a grudge on Japan for invading China.

Grudge for what, I'm not Aztec, I'm critizing Spanish genocide of the population of a whole continent, and mentioning that they didn't bring anything good.

&gt;4. the Aztecs sucked major fucking balls, the moment they were gone the world instantly became a better place to live, thanks Spain, thanks Cortez.

The Aztecs were better than the genocidal institutions and conquistadors from Europe, but I guess I'm meeting some edgy ethno nationalist.

Yes, because if I wanted useless internet points I would be in r/Europe critizing Europeans. Aztecs were better than the Spanish in every way, the difference was religion.

1538,"&gt;  
The Netherlands had its own Vietnam experience in Indonesia in the years immediately after World War II. Dutch troops failed to put down local resistance fighters and eventually gave the former colony its independence in 1949.  
  
“The East” is a Dutch movie that caused controversy in the Netherlands, because it tries to put the long-unexamined conflict under a moral microscope. If you’re thinking “Apocalypse Now” or “Platoon,” you’re not far off.  
  
The movie opens in theaters and will be available on all digital VOD platforms on Aug. 12, 2021.  
  
We’ve got a clip of a scene that happens in the middle of the movie. A group of inexperienced soldiers is sent on patrol, led by an incompetent commander who thinks he’s smarter than everyone else because he allegedly fought in the WWII resistance against the Nazis. He gets lost, and the unit ends up having to cross a river because the bridge shown on a map had been blown up months before. You can guess what happens.  
  
'The East' - Encountering the Enemy  
In this scene from the movie about the Dutch army fighting insurgents during the 1940's Indonesian National Rebellion, a group fo soldiers encounters rebels as they cross a stream.  
SharePlay Video  
The movie follows soldier Johan De Vries (played by Martijn Lakemeier) as he volunteers to fight in Indonesia and gets recruited into an elite unit by an enigmatic captain (Marwan Kenzari) known as “the Turk” to his men.  
  
The Turk employs incredibly brutal tactics to put down the resistance, the kind that we all know only hardens the resolve of a rebel force and contributes to a negative outcome to the war.  
  
The movie features both flashbacks and flash-forward scenes as it tells De Vries’ story. He goes back home with post-traumatic stress, and the movie uses his struggle in shocking ways. Director Jim Taihuttu is the great-grandson of an indigenous Moluccan who died fighting for the Dutch army during the conflict, and he wants to use the movie to shock his audience into thinking about the costs of his country’s colonial past.  
  
“The East” reminds Americans that we are not the only nation continuing to deal with a complicated past. It’s a film that wants to shock Dutch audiences into thinking about their country’s history, and that makes it fascinating viewing for the rest of us.",,/r/europe/comments/p3yxrq/the_east_confronts_an_unwinnable_war_in_southeast/h8v1bxp/,KevTravels,1628906532

1668,"&gt;Dressing up as a stereotypical black person

It's not stereotypical, it's often as realistic as you can reasonably expect without professional make-up.

&gt;in a way that most deem offensive

This is an argumentum ad populum. It doesn't even make sense because most people here don't find it offensive.

&gt;Once again, Zwarte Piet wasn't supposed to be an African but some racist asshole decided that Africans are to be made fun of.

Not sure where you suddenly got that from. This simply incorrect. He appeared in books before the dressing up even started. Never was he depicted as a character that's supposed to be made fun of. None of the old stories and songs mention that.

&gt;Why is it important for you that Zwarte Piet is African?

Because we shouldn't just blindly accept these ridiculous American taboos. The idea of Zwarte Piet being racist arrived here a few years ago. They didn't have any good arguments to defend that idea and it was ridiculed by most people. But then the public discussion was kind of cut short because a lot of companies and organisations already changed it, since they're frightened of being called 'racist'. It apparently doesn't matter to them that it doesn't make sense and that most people don't support it, the complainer always wins.

I don't like this brainless import of American culture, and their taboos are the last thing that we should copy. They're not exactly a racially peaceful country. I'm also 100% convinced that the protests against Zwarte Piet caused far more racism than Zwarte Piet himself ever did.

&gt;or because you think less of Africans?

Oh come on... Are you seriously saying that now? Despite what you seem to be telling yourself, Zwarte Piet does in no way show Africans as 'less' than Europeans.",,/r/europe/comments/p30ycu/how_to_irritate_europeans_with_one_sentence/h8unev5/,Flilix,1628899653

If the rental company is responsible for the flooring I probably will have to accept that ugly carpet from the seventies or some random quaint recent choice for all apartments I don't like as well. The houses this goes for are ones mostly those on the market for long term stay. And with this give you the freedom with putting what you like, bit not having to live with flooring you hate for years and or trying to put back the initial flooring.

Shirt term homes are more likely to have some flooring.

What has changed is that some time ago your custom floor was required to be removed no matter what, but these days there is a possibility you can get some money back if that floor is likely rentable.

You completely misunderstand the aims of the UK program. The UK program is to develop a UK based launch platform (none currently in Europe) for small to medium payloads. Probably less than the current Ariane-5. 

Satellites are getting smaller and more of them are being launched. It makes less sense every year to drag your payloads over to cape Canaveral, French Guyana or Russia to launch. It can be done in Europe if the capability is available.

1795,"Because of the popularity of **Le Roman de Renart**, renard became the standard French word for ""fox"", replacing the old French word for ""fox"", which was goupil from Latin vulpēcula.

The figure of Reynard  the Fox is thought to have originated in Lorraine folklore from where it spread to France, Germany, and the Low Countries. An extensive treatment of the character is the Old French Le Roman de Renart written by Pierre de Saint-Cloud around 1170, which sets the typical setting. Reynard has been summoned to the court of king Noble, or Leo, the lion, to answer charges brought against him by Isengrim the wolf. Other anthropomorphic animals, including Bruin the bear, Baldwin the ass, and Tibert (Tybalt) the cat, all attempt one stratagem or another. The stories typically involve satire whose usual butts are the aristocracy and the clergy, making Reynard a peasant-hero character.

2012,"SEOUL -- South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a dyed-in-the-wool progressive who once loathed pardons handed out by predecessors to convicted captains of industry, may have experienced a change of heart when it comes to Lee Jae-yong of Samsung Electronics.

""Many people also have sympathy"" for the company's imprisoned vice chairman, Moon said during a luncheon with representatives and leaders of South Korea's four-biggest conglomerates -- Samsung, Hyundai Motor, SK and LG -- at the presidential Blue House on June 2.

The executives were asking Moon to consider clemency for Lee, who has been jailed since January at the Seoul Detention Center. ""The economic situation is unfolding differently than in the past, and I know it requires bold action by corporations,"" Moon added.

The comments, in contrast to the president's previous hard line on pardons, could give Lee reason to hope he may not serve out his sentence of two and a half years for bribing President Park Geun-hye and her friend with corporate funds worth 8.6 billion won ($7.7 million) in 2015.

Analysts say Moon has been swayed by public opinion favoring Lee, as well as Samsung's plan to invest $17 billion in the U.S., announced during the president's visit to Washington last month, as South Korea's biggest company faces an intensifying competitive landscape in the key business of semiconductors.

A pardon for Lee is ""highly likely,"" said Park Sung-min, a veteran political analyst and head of Min Consulting. ""People's sentiments are positive on this,"" he said, citing the Lee family's announcement in April that it is donating the massive art collection -- including works by Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet -- accumulated by Lee Kun-hee, Lee Jae-yong's father and the late chairman of Samsung, to South Korean museums.

2113,"&gt;Climate change however, means that the punishment for having a bad fire response is MUCH more severe than it was 25 years ago.

I totally agree with you on that. 

I also agree with you, that it starts on ""this was exceptional!"", in this case though, it wasn't. The start of the fires was pretty much in line of what you'd expect. However, how fast it spread through all of those very dry forests wasn't. One part of that surely is Climate Change related, but not all of it and after reading a lot of what rangers and experts on forests had to say about it, i highly doubt it could not have been prevented. 

I also never relativized anything - it just is a matter of the fact, that in those extreme conditions, Wildfires spread like nothing else. 

These kind of conditions however, will be the new normal and there is no discussion, that unless fire prevention will be one of the top priorities, this will happen again very soon.

You people are so blinded with everything they throw down your throats because now they need to find excuses to make everyone buying electric vehicles after some lunatics spend tax money on building tons of facilities to make them and they're not selling.

If a chunk as big as that are burning, it's normal that the country next to it gets like 50º temperature. I'll give you the example of my country now: there's a lot of small fires around the district where i live. This city and almost all district is in almost a hole, surrounded by mountains. I can see smoke all around the city and those mountains. It's normal that down here it's hot af. The air is heated up. Not because of the sun itself or climatic changes. The culprit is all the smoke making this turning into a sauna.

Yet, the authorities catch them right when they're lighting all of it, they go to court, the defense claims that the person has mental problems, and he's free in the next hours.

Next year, by the same time, that person will lit some place else.

Governments need to wake up for this. Two years or three ago, the biggest tree part of my country burned to the ground and the persons who did it is walking free today.

This is not ""climate change"" fault.

Do you really have the imagination to realize how much a fire as big like that pollutes the air? And even worse: when it is all extinguished, there's no more trees to help restore some oxygen there for quite a long time. This is what damages everything, and coal factories in china making the batteries for the electric vehicles.

Governments will get to the real conclusion some day. When it's too late, as always. They're not effected by any of this. Money is always on those morons pockets and bank accounts.

Well since it's a matter of taste, and I don't personally find it disgusting, it's all ok, no? :) 


&gt;A grandma should be making tomato sauce, not putting ketchup on things


My grandma made lots of things by hand, tomato sauce just wasn't one of them. I guess culturally it just wasn't much of a thing where I grew up? 


Also, put it into context. Unfortunately my grandma is not around anymore for me to ask her how she got to this recipe but I can imagine it's possibly one of two scenarios:


1) she came up with this at some point in the early 90s after the fall of Communism, maybe saw on TV that people have ""pasta with tomato sauce"" over in the ""West"" and that was the closest thing she thought of making for her family, not knowing any better - and then we liked it, so she made it again and again

2) she came up with this whilst the whole Communism shebang was going on. I don't know, maybe the queue to buy something else was too long, and she just happened to have some pasta and ketchup in the house so she invented meal to keep her family fed? 


So in summary, I'm grateful to my grandma for making food that kept my belly full and happy, whether this was elaborate handmade feasts (or indeed, cheesecake or apple strudel... I'd give anything to have her versions of those again!!) .....or a quick 15 minute meal using - gasp! - pasta and ketchup ;) 



(To go on a slight tangent: I also used to be irritated by things that come in cans, which my grandma used to make by hand SO MUCH BETTER, namely beans. Whilst I still wish I could have my grandma's beans again, I got over it and do in fact enjoy some good Heinz beans on toast these days. :P )",,/r/europe/comments/p30ycu/how_to_irritate_europeans_with_one_sentence/h8s7wet/,FionaTheHobbit,1628862759

You'll find that few people think that Russia or Turkey currently have free and fair elections.

But back when e.g. Erdogan first got elected he got quite a bit of actual support. It took him a while to undermine turkish institutions (regardless of imperfections already present at the time).

And even without credible elections regimes need sufficient support or at the very least quiet looking the other way.

Things like anti-foreign-influence and anti-gay rhetoric wouldn't be employed as justifications for oppression if they didn't resonate with a sufficiently large part of the population.

Yes, shitty leaders. But even shitty leaders need support. 

As long as people tend to buy justifications from shitty leaders because they like to hear anti-other (black, gay, pther-way-to-worship-same-god, Chinese, brown, Jew, Arab, western, etc...) messaging, they ate not innocent in getting and keeping their shitty leaders.

And we don't need to look to just Russia, China and Turkey.
The US just had 4 years of especially shitty leadership and didn't fall into fascism because there was no competence and organization behind a coup attempt.
Republicans have been undermining democracy for many years with gerrymandering and active voter suppression. And establishment democrats fail to stop this in exchange for sage seats.

Meanwhile ""warrior"" cops shoot unarmed citizens and this gets excused with the murdered should have complied better.

And people can't even get a vaccine in the face of a pandemic without falling for some facebook swamp arguments.

I can find more examples in Europe and Africa.

One single city in china has as much electrified public transport as the rest of the world combined.

It has also cancelled a huge amount of planned and partially built coal plants in favour of clean energy. Meanwhile europe, the US and Japan love investing in coal plants in the 3rd world. [they are the top 3 when it comes to that](https://coalexit.org/report-investments)

How is that not more than any other country? Its ofcourse far from perfect, but people are acting like china does nothing on this front. I wish my country did half as much as they did.

sources from the EU.

&gt;Between 2010 and 2017, China, Europe, the United States and Japan accounted for 93 % of electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs combined) manufactured and 97 % of vehicle sales. Of these, China has contributed the largest proportion of sales and vehicle manufacturing in roughly equal proportions (Figure 3.1).

https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/electric-vehicles-from-life-cycle

&gt;China, one of the fastest growing economies in the world, has met its growing energy needs largely by investing in large dams and coal-fuelled power plants. In January 2017, however, China's National Energy Administration announced the cancellation of plans for over 100 coal-fired power plants. These cancellations come on top of those announced in 2016, which were for power plants already under construction. Growing public concerns over poor air quality and a quicker-than-expected uptake of renewables appear to have facilitated the decision to move away from coal. This type of decision will not only result in improvements in air quality but also contribute to the efforts to limit climate change.

Jake Davison was obsessed with the fact that he didn't have a girlfriend and subscribed to the so-called 'blackpill' movement

The suspected Plymouth shooter described being “defeated by life” in videos recorded just weeks before the massacre, as he blamed his troubles on not having a girlfriend.

Jake Davison, a 23-year-old apprentice crane operator, described himself on his YouTube channel as an ‘incel’ and made references to the ‘blackpill’ philosophy to which the radical fringe group subscribes.

An apparent gun obsession was also apparent from a playlist of videos compiled by Davison.

On Thursday night, witnesses claimed a gunman had “gone berserk” in Plymouth before opening fire. The suspect was named locally as Mr Davison.

Five people including a young girl ""under ten years old"" were killed during the shooting spree in the Keyham area of the city.

There were reports the victims included the shooter’s parents and police said the gunman was found dead at the scene from a gunshot wound.

In his final video blog, on July 28, the suspected killer spends 11 minutes ranting about how his life has hit a dead end, as he struggles to attract women or lose weight.

“I’m beaten down and defeated by f****** life, that drive I once had, that’s gone,” he says.

At the climax of his final video blog, Davison claims he likes to think “I’m a Terminator”. 

He continues: “The whole premise of the Terminator movies is that you know everything is rigged against you, there's no hope for humanity, you know, we're on the brink of extinction, these machines are unstoppable killing machines that can't be beaten, can't be outsmarted, but yet humanity still tries to fight to the end.

“I know it's a movie, but, you know, I like to think sometimes I'm a Terminator or something and despite reaching almost total system failure, he keeps trying to accomplish his mission.”

Davison earlier claims that “most people would have been completely, utterly broken if they had lived my f****** life”. 

Despite insisting he was not trying to stage a “pity party”, Davison goes on to claim the only way his life would be worse would be if he had suffered sexually abuse.

“For the most part, it’s just been me against the world, it’s just been me fighting an uphill battle with a big f****** rock on my back, while I’m seeing motherf****** that don’t deserve half of anything, they’re getting a free road to the top,” he says.

He describes working in construction scaffolding as a teenager, when he felt positive about life - he was “finally going to move out...get my passport...do all the things I wanted to do in life”.

This all changed, he complains, after he suffered an ankle injury. He says he struggled to recover from the setback in the way other men, like professional fighters, would.

“I always keep trying but it's like I'm at the point now where it's like, why do I even bother? For what? I'm still in the same house, same situation, same position, still everything's the same,” he says.

He ruefully reflects that other men have wives and children to support them.

“Does an incel, a virgin get that? No,” he continues.

""I'm socially isolated have no social circle and don't know any girls. Been in male dominated environments most my life. Last girl I spoke to was when i was 18 years old unless you count cashiers and supermarkets.""

Comments made by Davison below his YouTube videos further espouse the worldviews of an incel, short for involuntary celibate.

The subculture is made up of young men who consider themselves unable to attract women sexually. Their views are characterised by deep misogyny and hostility towards the opposite sex.

In one online comment, Davison, who is a weightlifter, said he had been “consuming the blackpill overdose”.

The blackpill, named as an alternative to the so-called bluepill and redpill in the Matrix films, is a fatalist outlook centred on the belief that success with the opposite sex is determined at by genetics at birth.

According to one article online, blackpillers believe that no amount of working out (gymmaxxing), earning money (betabuxxing), or sexual strategy (running game) will ever lead to a relationship. They believe there is nothing left to do but to commit suicide (rope) or lay down and rot (LDAR).

Davison says in one YouTube comment beneath his own video: “The blackpill makes you looks (sic) obsessed I never used to be this way the longer you go without any kind of interaction with women and sex relationships etc etc the more you become concerned about looks but blackpill turbo charges it.”

In another video, uploaded three weeks before the shooting, Davison goes on a 10-minute misogynistic rant about biological attraction.

He accuses most women of being “very simple-minded” and only being drawn to attractive men.

“The reality is, and, this is my view, I think a big proportion of people don't realize that black pill doesn't just apply to incels guys, it applies to a lot of guys these days not having sex for six months, for a year,” he says.

He then continues, in a particularly shocking outburst: “Why do you think sexual assaults and all these things keep rising? The reality is that women don't need men no more and they certainly don't want and don't need average men and below average, you have to go abroad to fund a woman.”

Over several years, Davison had liked nearly 800 videos on YouTube which point to an obsession with US gun culture and the second amendment, violent video games, and heavy weight lifting.

In several videos, YouTube personalities from the US take the viewer through various gun demonstrations, including shooting a teddy bear and an SUV vehicle with a rifle and 20mm bullets.

One video from the US gun show includes a salesman showing off a pistol inspired by the former US President Donald Trump. The gun, which was being sold for $3,000, had 'make america great again' inscribed on its side.

Aside from a clear fascination with firearms, Davison also watched a vast range of videos on weightlifting and dieting, including one clip titled 'Why Am I Fat?'.  

His obsession with his weight and looks appears rooted in a misogynistic desire for a girlfriend, with several of the videos he liked asking “why women always lie” and “why toxic masculinity is a lie”.

One video looks at “why some hot women date down” and “why she dates a fat man”.

Davison also liked a clip from a video game which was shared on YouTube in Jan 2015, where the male character says he is “looking for a whore”. 

Incel culture has been associated with a string of killings and acts of violence, particularly in the US.

Elliot Rodger, 22, became a spiritual figurehead of the incel movement when he murdered six people in Isla Vista, California, in 2014.

Before his deadly rampage, Rodger had uploaded a YouTube video outlining his attack and motives in which he said he wanted to take revenge on women for rejecting him.",,/r/europe/comments/p3k9gm/plymouth_gunman_jake_davison_said_i_am_a/h8rl0zo/,AnotherArat,1628848239

2428,"&gt;No one said anything about it being funny.

Of course, it isn't. So why the joke?

Because, as I've said, I've had the almost exact same conversation twenty years ago, and when any horrendous shit is brought up, that was always the excuse to backpedal.

&gt;Much of the suffering of the Russian and Chinese people since nuclear weapons were invented has been at the hands of their own governments so I'm not sure why you think such a ""suffering contest"" would favor either of those nations.

'Course, and people have never acted on old grudges. You also didn't answer the second part, do you really think they wouldn't take advantage of that excuse? I think you do, which means that the ""risk"" of nuclear escalation is pretty much a certainty.

&gt;Relative to what? Because in the context of wars fought throughout the ages, the fight in AFG has been quite restrained by comparison.

Let's limit the war to after the invention of Nuclear Inventions, shall we?

&gt;We did ask for him to be handed over prior to the invasion as well as shut down terrorist camps. The Taliban declined.

Then negotiate, or realize that you were asking too much. 

&gt;You cannot just send a ""surgical strike team"" to wander around Afghanistan, hoping to bump into the intended target.

I concede this point, withdrawals tend to scarper any special operation missions for that reason.

&gt;Not realistic. Thousands of my countrymen were just murdered and untold billions of damage both to property and the economy had been done. ""Just ignore it"" was never an option.

And how did that turn out? How many more Americans died? How many trillions were spent? Do you think it was worth it? 

And you know what? That's when a leader needs to re-direct it, because anger can make you scary, but it can also mean that you get in a fight you didn't need to.

&gt;Let's focus this discussion on Afghanistan as adding in Iraq is just muddying the waters. 

Iraq does matter, since it drew resources and soured relationships as part of the ""War on Terror"". You can't make it a closed system observation, especially when power vacuums in one affect the other, and could give a blueprint for what will happen in Afghanistan. Some involved on both sides also knew of events that occurred in the other, so Fallujah and Abu Ghraib are important.

And if it muddies the water, it's because it complicates it. Over-simplification and analyses in vacuum may be what caused this mess. 

&gt;If you want to argue that the US overestimated its ability to build up a power center in AFG that could resist the Taliban's return, fine. I'd agree with that. That's also an easy observation to make with the benefit of hindsight and part of my point is that this should be a lesson in the case of future attacks.

.. Problem is, it's not hindsight for me. Don't think that this outcome was a surprised to everyone.

It's not even a satisfying ""I told you so"", because it's such a waste of everything.

That, and I think nothing was learned. If the only lesson is to pass the buck to the Afghani government, then there's no introspection.

2569,"&gt; Personally, I think opening up the floodgates to using nukes for conflicts with no superpowers would have sent a good excuse to China and Russia. All of that for the head of one man, who ended up being in Pakistan.

The 'perhaps' in my original comment was meant to indicate that there is some nuance to it and that I wasn't being 100% serious. Lowering the bar for nuclear release would be one of the risks in such a strategy, I admit. That said, neither Russia nor China has been attacked on the level that 9/11 was for the US, so it wouldn't be a justification to just nuke any thorn in your side just because of some small-scale terrorist incidents.

&gt; The ROI of this venture doesn't look pretty good, and the message seems to be a general hit in the prestige of those who participated in the invasion. ""Better to be feared than love, but most of all avoid being hated"".

Well, it's difficult to truly calculate. The point of having nuclear weapons is to deter other entities from attacking your country by the threat of annihilation of they do.  

&gt; On the topic of turning places into ""glass craters"", has going lower and lower in methods actually worked out for you in the two wars in the Middle East?

That's hard to say because we really haven't gone 'lower and lower'.  We could have been significantly more brutal in both AFG and Iraq if we wanted to. But we developed and used costly 'smart' technology to try to avoid collateral damage, we didn't go house to house and slaughter every military-aged-male we found, we put our own troops in significant danger by having them interface with the local populations and sending them all over each country in vehicles that were vulnerable to IEDs. So much blood and treasure was spent on our side trying to soften the harshness of war.  

When we look at the history of AFG since the 9/11 attacks, there just aren't a lot of easy solutions to ultimate question of how to respond to terror attacks. The superficially easy answer to a terrorist attack from a foreign entity is to ""just go get the people responsible"", but the difficult follow up question is what to do to prevent future attacks.  

We tried, and failed, to mold AFG into a nation-state capable of sticking up for itself against the Taliban threat once we inevitably left. So what *realistic* options does that leave?",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/p36bcy/uk_troops_sent_to_get_britons_out_of_afghanistan/h8r3ol0/,Shmorrior,1628834126

Traditional Swede joke is started by ""A Finnish, a Swedish and a Norwegian went to..."" and usually the Swede is the one made fun of. Though not always. Examples:

*A Finn, a Swede and a Norwegian went to an airplane. The plain started to fall, but there was just 2 parachutes. The Finn gave a backpack to Swede who happily shouted ""so long suckers"" and jumped out. Norwegian stared the Finn and asked ""are you mad, now there's only one left!"" But them the Finn said ""No worries, I just gave him my own backpack with some underwear and lunch in it"".* (Note, that this joke relies on some Finnish words on being close to backpack).

Another one:

*A Finn, a Swede and a Norwegian went to sauna. They started to compete who can take the most. Swede left immediately. The Norwegian kept throwing water on the stove but the Finn didn't even budge. Finally the Norwegian ran out. Later on the Finn also arrived and the Norwegian asked ""Are you insane, how could you take it?""

""Are you Russians"", because we sure as hell aren't Russians, fought two wars against them (which we technically won based on the fact that we retained independence, even though we were murkily in the Soviet Sphere for a long time keeping the Kremlin happy)

""Finland was part of the Axis"", because we were not an Axis member and instead independently fought a war against the USSR that had taken over the lands that over a hundred thousand Finns lived in that we wanted back, and Germany was the only side willing to support us in this. We joined as a co beligerrent and even though (based on my reading in school and video watching about the war) we Finns deliberately worked to spark a war with the USSR. We also had German troops stationed, because Finland would never be able to truly invade the USSR without German troops aiding, with them concentrated in the northern Lappland region. Also if someone claims we directly helped in the holocaust, we only in the earlier stages deported about 12 Austrian Jewish refugees back to Germany in what was back then a controversial move leading to no more delivery of jews to Germany, while also we had Finnish Jewish soldiers fighting along side German ones (quite a bit of irony with the German forces in Finland fighting Judeo Bolshevism with the help of Jews). Also Finland only really initially helped in the war capturing lost lands and defensive forward position like the river between Ladoga and the other lakes. We did not aid in the siege of Leningrad outside cutting northern land access that was due to Finland taking back the territory that the Soviets had occupied, while we didn't really help (outside airports possibly) with the siege itself, as we didn't try to attack the city from the north, nor did we try to cut off the road of life on the Ladoga, a vital supply route to the encircled city.

3473,"&gt; At the time, capitalism was hell for the ordinary man. 14 hour workdays, low pay, squalid living conditions, short life. something needed to change, 

A function of the time to an extent. I have little doubt that if socialism existed in the 19th century there would also be low pay, grueling work hours, squalid living conditions and low life expectancy.   

The counter example is how today the shortest workweeks are generally found in the most capitalistic countries. Because they can afford it. They also have the highest life expectancies, wages, living conditions and ironically the most consumer and environmental protections. 

In general I think socialists make a big logical mistake by attributing everything to ideology and filing people as capitalists or socialists. Whereas in the end of the day we're all human. Rich capitalists can be concerned about their health and  sacrifice their profits and poor socialists  can be concerned about their money and sacrifice their health. That's in fact what happened in the 20th century.  

&gt;and Marx played a large part by showing that workers have power, and do not need a neo feudal lord to own the profits of their work.   

Maybe but he could have also done it without spawning such an ideology. An ideology in which propaganda and lack of self-reflection are intrinsic and the source of much of their problems.  You also don't need Marx to have social progress. England began putting restrictions on child labour before Marx was  born. European countries  began banning slavery and serfdom long before socialism was a thing. 



&gt;also communism and socialism is not that equality in outcome bullshit that you describe, nor was it ever meant that way. it is about the ownership of productive capital from which, according to actual marxists, all power flows.   

It is about equality. When you get paid the same as all your coworkers what's the point of working harder? And what's the point of having more money if you can't buy things like a nice house or a car with it? Hell usually you couldn't buy a house or a car at all, and just had to wait for your government assigned one to become available. You also couldn't do too bad when a work  place was guaranteed and paid enough to buy the heavily subsidised, sometimes rationed, goods that everyone bought. It wouldn't make much difference in your life whether you were among the most productive people or the least. 

Who's to say what a productive person is anyway when everyone works for the state, state companies prop each other  up and prices are set by bureaucrats? Maybe you are super productive but you work for a non-competitive business propped up by others and your work is actually worth very little for society.

That's not quite how things always worked but because socialist states were more free market than they'd like to admit. It was the model they were supposed to follow at least. 


&gt;you are judging Marx as if he wrote the communist manifesto yesterday. his analysis has lost validity for a large part because people followed his ideas, changed them, got influenced by them. The world had changed radically since the 1850s.  

I've been told that before. It's true I can't judge him on what his followers did.   And I do appreciate the world getting good things like vacations, worker rights, unions, etc though I can't know that's really because of him. Not sure even if I knew they wouldn't exist without him I'd  think that exonerates him.  But I know he has called for violence and I can judge him for that. Or for not seeing the problems with his ideology. I can judge him for creating this particular brand of socialism/communism that sounds so sickly sweet, utopian and captures the minds of people.  

Because socialism isn't simply about the economy or the workers. Many socialists seem to want socialism just for socialism's sake. Judging by their reactions it's more important than economic conditions or human rights. Ain't no socialist that's gonna tell you Cuba or Venezuela should become more capitalistic even though they would never want to move there.

 The ideology is basically like a religion. It's  intensely propagandistic, heavy handed, demanding for agreement with it and even self-selecting towards extremism. It's perfectly engineered to not only look attractive (in theory) but to distract and handwave away all of its problems by pointing at capitalism's problems. Chances are whether you live in a capitalist  or socialist country you're going to hear about capitalism's problems. 

Cause that's what socialist ideologues do. They love to point out every little thing that's less than perfect in capitalism and attribute it to greed without context or realistic exploration of alternatives. They write books about capitalism, make speeches about capitalism, hold meetings over it, regularly congratulate their country on beating it (yeah), even on reddit they congregate on subs like r/latestagecapitalism. That's why socialism is  so enduringly popular. It's easy to hate on capitalism.   But that's  also why socialism is so bad. It's too obsessed with capitalism, as a defensive mechanism, to address and remedy any of its own faults. All of its spectacular failures, excesses, crimes against its values, just stack up on each other and nobody cares because they're trained to only bad mouth capitalism. And if anyone does complain  about socialism well they're not a true supporter, off to the gulag with them if they were too overt.

And who's fault is  that? Well that's Marx. This is how he created socialism. Ironically I think he's made capitalism better and socialism worse... Which is not necessarily a good thing for people in capitalist countries if they do end up switching to socialism. He's also contributed to me writing annoying sentences by  overusing the S word and C word so much.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/p2tzyc/karl_marx_loved_freedom/h8n70pg/,ZmeiOtPirin,1628769098

3519,"&gt; For the books it may seem Germany (and the rest of the EU) are the only ones doing a good job, but I don't think that is true. Simplified, CO2 is produced by making goods and transporting goods. The center of the production of goods has moved from the EU/US to China, making it appear that the EU is doing a good job on the CO2 front (as fewer goods are being produced, meaning less CO2), but at the end of the day, the goods that are produced in China are mostly consumed in the EU/US, so we only exported out CO2. In addition, these goods need to be transported to the EU, which means that netto there is an even higher CO2 footprint for each produced good. These stats seem to give europeans the chance to pat themselves on the back, and saying that at least they are doing their part. At the same time they keep destroying the environment one iPhone at a time.

Export emissions are only 10-20% of China's emissions for example. International transport is included in the statistics separately and is about 3% of world emissions.

More importantly, the exporting countries also benefit from that economic activity, so why wouldn't they be coresponsible? Most importantly, the production happens on their territory, under their laws, so they are the only ones who can change those laws and enforce them properly. So the responsibility for those emissions is mostly in the hands of the producer, IMO.

Sometimes it's the only truly independent media. It's important that this exists.

Imagine M6 is highly critical of that government. M6 is, AFAIK, owned by RTL.

Now imagine that government introduces a bill which, basically, forces M6 to either stop broadcasting terrestrially, or be bought out - and it's no secret that in this climate, the only people who will buy it are either pro-government, or state owned companies - the first was already attempted with a radio network, the other already happened with a company which owned around 20 local newspapers, it was bought by the state oil company, Orlen.

To take your example, during the First Dacian War the Roman troops were split, advancing through both Banat and Dobruja. Decebalus's forces attacked the ones in Dobruja, and you are correct that he was leading an alliance of Dacians, Buri and Sarmatians.

The other example is also very good, by the siege of Sarmisegetuza it's normal for Decebalus's forces to have been heavily depleted.

I think the 200-250,000 numbers represent the total potential capacity of the Kingdom, all the arms-bearing men it could possibly muster.

You have to remember that these are numbers coming from the Roman point of view.

They discuss that in the podcast I linked to.

The Russians lied anyway - they wouldn't have gathered all the top brass on a ship nearby for a test of a 30 year old Type 65 practice torpedo.

Oh please... How the hell can Canada and the US put out their fires in the taiga/boreal forest but it's suddenly impossible if they're in Russia. 

Russia leased 2 Beriev Be-200 planes to Greece, and 2 to Turkey (for $158 000/day), and from what I could quickly find online, there are only 7 flight-worthy planes in the whole of Russia. They have a range of over 2100km, and just from the Yakutsk airport to the sea there are 1000 km, without taking into account [the other airports](http://www.mappery.com/maps/Central-Russia-Map.gif). So, most of the Berievs are rented to Greece and Turkey, whilst the firefighters in Yakutia are ""walking on foot in search of smoke and using shovels and manual backpack pumps where necessary"".

Instead of buying boats to save people, they buy drones to spot boats and then call the lybian coast guard, a bunch of terrorists, who most of the time ignore the calls of frontex, leading to hundreds if not thousands of deaths. Frontex is also using the small amount of boats they do have to create waves to turn boats around to go to Turkey or die in the middle of the ocean.

If your mouth is open you will close it right away, lol. Everything you touch will be hot and maybe even burn you unless it's made of wood: tile, concrete, asphalt, canvas, definitely metal. Bits of your car might start to melt and the plastic on your dashboard will off-gas and cover the inside of your windshield in weird goo that is hard to get off. If you leave your sunglasses on the dashboard they will get covered in it too. Your steering wheel will be too hot to touch and god forbid you have leather seats. Sometimes driving you have to turn the heat up high to stop your engine over heating and you have to be careful where you park as any plants under your car that touch the exhaust will catch on fire. If you lie on the ground you will sweat from the heat of the ground even at night if the air is cool, it just radiates up at you. Your body won't want to eat much. You need to take salt tablets or electrolytes especially if you are active or are older. At that heat getting in the water is only nice if it's also in the shade. Sometimes it rains and the water evaporates a few feet above the ground, usually around head height.

*googles*

https://noosphere.princeton.edu/kursk.html

There's a timeline.

&gt;Day one: Saturday 12 August 
&gt;
&gt;Russia's Northern Fleet Command loses contact with the Kursk nuclear submarine taking part in exercises in the Barents Sea. [Norwegian seismologists register two underwater explosions at about 09:30 MESZ (07:30 GMT). It is probably the accident of the Kursk.]

The first the outside world would have known was about two days later:

&gt;Day three: Monday 14 
&gt;
&gt;A Russian navy official admits that the Kursk is on the seabed…[The announcement is made shortly before 09:00 MESZ, 48 hours after the accident.] 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_submarine_disaster

&gt;There was considerable debate over how long the sailors in the ninth compartment had survived. Russian military officers initially gave conflicting accounts, that survivors could have lived up to a week within the sub, but those that died would have been killed very quickly. The Dutch recovery team reported that they thought the men in the least affected ninth compartment might have survived for two to three hours.[3] But the level of carbon dioxide in the compartment exceeded that which people can produce in a closed space.[9] Divers found ash and dust inside the compartment when they first opened that hatch, evidence of a fire. But this fire was separate from that caused by the exploding torpedo.[4]:143–145
&gt;
&gt;Captain-Lieutenant Kolesnikov, evidently the senior officer in the compartment, wrote a final note at 15:15 in the dark, giving evidence that he was alive at least four hours after the explosion.[101] Other notes recovered later show that some sailors in the ninth compartment were alive at least 6 hours and 17 minutes after the boat sank.[32] Vice Admiral Vladislav Ilyin, first deputy chief of the Russian Navy's staff and head of the Kursk Naval Incident Cell, concluded that the survivors had lived up to three days.[4]:143–145
&gt;
&gt;In any event, the Russian rescue teams were poorly equipped and badly organised, while foreign teams and equipment were far away and not given permission to assist.[4]:143–145[63] It is unlikely that any rescue by either Russian or foreign specialists could have arrived and reached the sub in time to rescue any survivors.[102]

As far as I can tell, there's no hard evidence that any possible noises were actually from the crew — it wasn't known whether anyone survived the explosion until after everyone was dead.

If we take the most-optimistic post-accident estimate listed of three days of survival there, that would have been at most 24 hours to understand what was going on, coordinate with the rescue team, the Soviet Union to clear  the obvious national security issues wirh having a British sub linking up with the Kursk, prep the rescue sub and divers, evaluation of the sub's condition to be done and transferred,  the technical information regarding interfacing the two subs to be provided, the rescue sub to be transported out to the site, the divers prepped, the actual dive performed, and the subs mated.",🇺🇸 🍔 United States of America 🍔 🇺🇸,/r/europe/comments/p2rg1h/otd_21_years_ago_during_a_military_exercise_at/h8m7ff3/,duisThias,1628742074

3905,"&gt; For the gazillionth time; this should not be possible in the EU. It baffles me that after years and years of shitting on what the EU stands for (while getting most of its money), still nothing effective is being done about it.

This is nothing. Do you know the details of the ""rule of law"" concerns?

They created and passed a legislation which changed how the Constitutional Tribunal (responsible for determining whether legislation is constitutional or not) works, superseding rules which were put directly into the Constitution. It had no vacatio legis. Example: constitution says ""Decisions of the Constitutional Court are made by majority vote."". The new legislation says they need 2/3 of the votes.

Clearly unconstitutional, right? But, of course, the institution for determining that is Constitutional Tribunal itself. So they did, and the verdict was that it was unconstitutional. But here's the problem: legislation was itself about how constitutional tribulnal works. So, they worked *under the old rules*.

But, the legislation had no vacatio legis. So guess what, PiS refused to acknowledge the verdict, because - according to them - Constitutional Tribunal should've operated under the new rules. 

**It's insane troll logic, basically.** If that is how it's supposed to work, they could as well just make a legislation called Constitution 2.0 which claims it supersedes the Constitution, vote it in in and change literally everything with a simple majority.

Apparently for a while various institutions, judges etc. tried to act as if the verdict passed was a reality, but eventually they yielded and PiS-reality asserted itself. What should've happened? In the end, Constitution is just words unfortunately, so nothing can be done if _something_ forcefully pretends it is different than it is.

IMO, in the abstract, it means PiS basically did a coup at that moment. EU kinda weakly bothered them for a moment. Vast majority of the population surely doesn't even know what PiS did. Scary how stuff like that can just happen.

Frankly, military should've recognized it as a coup IMO and purged the fuckers. That worked few times in Turkey, AFAIK (until it finally didn't). I mean, in the abstract they did unlawfully take over a country, making a facade-country in its place. Mostly works as a real country, but they can bend or break the rules if they want or wish to. They generally don't do it too overtly because they're trying to pretend nothing's happening.

Sadly if _something_ violently disposed of them that would make stuff even worse practically, so yeah.",Earth (Poland),/r/europe/comments/p2awb3/protests_in_poland_against_new_law_proposed_by/h8lzofd/,Sinity,1628732853

These [liberum-veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberum_veto)-like mechanisms were a stupid mistake. It's kinda funnily ironic, tho.

&gt; Many historians hold that the liberum veto was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system, particularly in the 18th century, when foreign powers bribed Sejm members to paralyze its proceedings, and the Commonwealth's eventual destruction in the partitions of Poland and foreign occupation, dominance and manipulation of Poland. Piotr Stefan Wandycz wrote that the ""liberum veto had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy"". In the period of 1573–1763, about 150 sejms were held, about a third failing to pass any legislation, mostly because of the liberum veto.

Profiting from the economic activity of French citizens without paying taxes offends the French sense of fraternité.

4122,"Southern Californian here. There's a lot to talk about when it comes to fires.

Weirdly, in the LA area, we've been having later and later fire seasons. The worst in recent memory have been in November for us. But California is a massive, ecologically diverse place, so it's different for everyone. Socal, NorCal, and the ""bay area"" (essentially Middle California) all get fires at different times of year, with different impacts. LA and the surrounding area's climate is a lot like the Mediterranean's (to the point where we're actually taught in school that ""Mediterranean Climate"" is what we have), so we have similar fire risks to countries like Greece and Albania. South of here is the Sonora Desert, and east of here is the High Mojave Desert, both of which are always oppressively hot and dry, but don't have much burnable material. The borders separating Baja California (the peninsula Mexico owns), the Mojave, and Sonora are all disputed because they all kinda blend in areas. The bay area has pretty distinct climate, with milder summers, more humidity, and colder winters (but it's still traditional ""California""-- nobody sees snow up there anywhere near sea level still!) They tend to have their fire season in the late summers, which tend to be much drier. NorCal fires are awful and a threat seemingly always, because they get HOT, dry summers, but also have a climate that supports the most greenery. 

When you think of California, the coast, weather, and urban sprawl are probably what come to mind. And yes, we have lots of all that, but there's a lot more that comes into play with our weird fire threat. We've been spared this summer in SoCal from crazy weather on all fronts, it's been pretty temperate, but I'm not looking forward to how things'll be in the coming months.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/p1rksr/who_helps_greece_by_country/h8l4toz/,Communiconfidential,1628718703

What russia has is a law that basically bans all anti Russian independent journalistic sites. How? Because every journalistic group is partially owned by foreign capital. Every single one except for government media. They’re owned by foreign capital because anyone can buy shares being an independent company and these shares can come from all over the world, they also get donations with foreign capital and many people who run these media groups fled because they fear assassination and own the outlets through foreign capital because they’re in another country fearing for their lives.

We are talking about the youth here. The youth isn't particularly conservative *in general* anywhere in Europe.

&gt;This east/west divide is nothing new, the west has historically been more liberal and progressive than the eastern bloc countries. I would just say that its generally people from eastern Europe who want to migrate to the west, not the other way around.

I'm not sure whether you are talking about this conservative/liberal divide already preceding the Cold War? Also, the main reason for *any* mass emigration from post-socialist countries is the socialist-ruined economies which are often still remarkably lower than in countries that weren't under socialism. Both the relative conservatism and higher rates of emigration may derive from the same source, but not from each other.

&gt;Contrary to earlier in the pandemic, when kids were rarely reported to become severely sick with COVID-19, health officials are now alerting the public that the virus is rapidly affecting more children and teens.

&gt;Arkansas cases in the under 18 age group have increased by 517% in three months.

&gt;Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock and Arkansas Children's Northwest in Springdale had a combined total of 21 COVID-19 patients as of Monday, spokesperson Hilary DeMillo tells Axios.

&gt;Eight of the patients are in the ICU, and five are on ventilators.

In the Czech Republic, just 16 percent of young people would be willing to accept a Muslim as a member of their family and just 51 percent would accept a Jewish person; in Romania, these figures are 32 and 44 percent respectively.

I'm from eastern Europe. I will point out that I would probably never fully accept a religious person as member of my extended family (e.g. say partner of my brother), this applies to Christianity, judaism, islam or any other fucking religion. A quick Google search suggests that over 70% of Czech people are irreligious. Most of muslims I've met are very religious and practicing their faith, this does not apply to most jewish people I've met.

Worse than that, we are deindustrializing. The industry is moving (has mostly moved, in fact) and takes its emissions along with it. 

Europe doesn't really make anything anymore. As far as money is actually still earned, it is financiers investing in China or other places without enforced emissions regulation, and living off the dividends. And the rest of Europe's economy is the services sector catering ultimately to those financiers. Anything we actually use, we import.

I'd actually say a rising GDP coupled with diminishing domestic consumption is a clear sign of a economy that's already started to collapse in on itself. Wages rising faster than inflation is a sign of an improving economy, wages rising slower than inflation is a sign of a worsening economy.

Their main reason was the fact that the Dacians under Decebalus were a major threat to the Empire, he had managed to unite all the tribes, they had iron and bronze mines as well as highly skilled smiths enabling them to produce good quality weapons at will, and could mobilize up to 250,000 warriors. Decebalus was an excellent military general as well as a beloved leader and a skilled diplomat, well known for his active opposition to the Empire and his constant diplomatic attempts at forging anti-Roman alliances.

The Dacian Kingdom did not overlap today's Romania, it was smaller. The rest of the area was inhabited by various other tribes, some of them were tribes of so-called ""free Dacians"" who had chosen not to join the Kingdom (Buri, Potulatenses, Getae, Teurisci), some were Sarmatian (Iazyges, Bastarnae), some were Celts or Germanic (Roxolani, Peucini). These tribes were not united and did not pose an immediate danger to the Romans once the unifying factor that was Decebalus was removed, so there was no point in fighting all of them.

Not quite, unfortunately. They could just be making a gamble and playing for the long game. In case of an early election, PiS will likely take the most votes, but still loose control of the Sejm (lower chamber of our parliament) as even in coalition with Konfederacja they'd end up with less votes than the combined (non-Konfederacja) opposition. However, early elections wouldn't necessarily be a good thing. The problem is that it is very unlikely the current opposition would have enough votes to overrule the presidential veto. Since the next presidential elections are in 4 years, this would mean that the new government would end up in a near total deadlock, unable to pass anything without PiS' approval, for it's entire term, rather than ""just"" the first half of it. It would be pretty much impossible to undo any of the shady changes PiS introduced, the public media and the institutions they took over would still be doing their bidding.

4858,"The support for the Nazis in Germany wasn’t anything special for Germany before WW2/they fielded the government.

The majority of Nazi supporters became supporters because it was economically unviable not to.

Even at the 33 election the Nazi party gained 33% I f the votes and were barely the strongest power (and that was after the assimilation of different parties in the right wing with different views).

To put that into perspective, Hitler had an approval rating in the US of roughly around 30-35% at this time.

Basically Hitler was seen as a positive change for Germany world wide by a good chunk of populations.

And you have to realize that back then, if you controlled the media (which was the first angle of attack for the Nazis after Hitler got out of prison) you basically controlled information (which for most people back then basically was reality).

You couldn’t just go on the internet to post your independent news articles. You needed printing presses to proliferate your idea, something the Nazi affiliated street militia destroyed as soon as you started printing against the Nazis.

My great grandfather was a printer and writer and was murdered for that (and being a member of the SPD).

So yeah, for many being anti-Nazi wasn’t feasible. And let‘s not ignore the massive support from foreign countries for the Nazi party, since without that support this wouldn’t have been possible.

Families like the Bush’s, Kennedy‘s etc.

Why did they support the Nazis? Well 2 main reasons:

1.) They thought Hitler was good for business (which in a way he was, many of his prior supporters earned a fortune through WW2).

2.) Anti-semitism was very popular back then, especially in the industrial elite. Including in communist Russia btw (tho they didn’t like Hitler because he claimed that Russia should become German territory).

So yeah, saying „It was the Germans fault.“ is a very simple minded thought process for a very difficult and multi layered issue. Could the German people ultimately prevented Hitler? Absolutely.

5053,"The Eiger is a 3,967-metre mountain of the Bernese Alps, overlooking Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland, just north of the main watershed and border with Valais. 

It is the easternmost peak of a ridge crest that extends across the Mönch to the Jungfrau at 4,158 m, constituting one of the most emblematic sights of the Swiss Alps. While the northern side of the mountain rises more than 3,000 m above the two valleys of Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, the southern side faces the large glaciers of the Jungfrau-Aletsch area, the most glaciated region in the Alps. 

The most notable feature of the Eiger is its nearly 1,800-metre-high north face of rock and ice, named Eiger-Nordwand, Eigerwand or just Nordwand, which is the biggest north face in the Alps. 

The first ascent of the Eiger was made by Swiss guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren and Irishman Charles Barrington, who climbed the west flank on 11 August 1858. 

The north face, the ""last problem"" of the Alps, considered amongst the most challenging and dangerous ascents, was first climbed in 1938 by an Austrian-German expedition.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/p25wrn/the_3967metre_eiger_mountain_in_the_bernese_alps/h8hz10o/,filosoful,1628656590

( the EU has something like that IIRC )

For fire, a centralized system for coordinating efforts would be required, for fast deployment on such vast areas. You know. Like a EU ~~army~~ administration. 

Remember, it's not about the fire, but the sheer scale of the problem. You need to use the resources that any country can spare as effective as possible. A collaboration treaty if you will. It's about logistics, communication, deployment, food distribution, evacuation, it's a nightmare. And remember. At the end of the day, we are, still, in a pandemic. Thus, even convincing 1 more dude to vaccinate reduces the stress on the system to be able to move resources to other areas. 

And, in 6 months, to a year, a very heavy recession is about to hit Europe, and the whole world, in the face. 

We are not prepared. But the vaccines are getting there, the heatwave is going to pass, the economies will recover. 

 a table of who’s got the biggest balls -&gt; that would be Germany, but, even if you are dead last, if you pulled your weight, you are useful.

Siberian forests burn down every summer. It's going to get worse and worse until some sort of a naturally occurring equilibrium is reached. Realistically, there is nothing we can do about that.

Also Churchill's idea that Prussia must be broken up, as it was, I believe proven correct, it had generally been the centre of Germanic militaristic expansionism. Now Germany expands economically and politically, notably into southern european nations.

But the equation is completely different when you must commit a significant force to every single region due to wide gun ownership and massive hate against your regime.

Ground firefighting teams are the main force, you can't do shit without them. And no, one or even 2 il 76s is not as capable.

5711,"&gt; Good for them. I am not saying people should not take it

I'm just going to hold you on what you actually said before. You said there was a risk in taking the vaccine. 

So I'll just underline again that if you as a young healthy person thinks the risk of taking this vaccine is too big for you, then you're a) a pussy b) an idiot.

The actual risk of taking the vaccine is like this: There is no risk.

Younger people also can get problems with covid. I know myself one guy in his 30ies with no sense of smell and taste for a year plus another guy that was constantly tired for months after having it (idk if he got over it though, it's supposed to last like six months.)

A person that thinks like this: I can choose between a) a risk of loosing my sense of smell/taste for a year, possibly also be tire out for six months, and you might also be badly sick for weeks OR b) a risk of nothing, and then you pick a). 

This person licking a) here an idiot, as only an idiot would pick the larger risk.

As for spread. It's always been known it's possible for vaccinated people to get ill asymptotically and maybe pass it on. And delta made that a lot worse. But it still got to limit the spread. 

You can see today the difference between Iceland and Australia. Iceland is like 80-90% vaccinated and they can deal with delta with very few restrictions. Australia is like 15% vaccinated so they have to do hardcore lockdowns again.

You have the choice here between a) very few restrictions or b) hardcore lockdown (Australia). One who willingly chooses b) is an idiot.

&gt;Sure, the KSF is a new army that was only established in 2018 (before that it was a civil defence agency).
