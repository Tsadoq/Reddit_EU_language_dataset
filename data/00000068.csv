23,"Chicken and egg story. Labour unions don't care about younger members of society because they don't join a labour union, but they don't join labour unions because those unions don't give a damn about them. The unions will have no say whatsoever anymore in 10-15 years because they won't have enough members left, they already dropped below the symbolic 1 million members mark 2 years ago and it's still declining. 

So yes, these organisations should listen to them and should act in their interests because if they don't, they will never get this group behind them. If they don't get the younger generations behind them, their future rests in the hands of the boomers and it will be a short story. Their members will be pensioners in a few years and dead shortly after. 


Then again the whole boomer situation in the Netherlands is slightly different. The pensions should've been reformed about 30 years ago, but when one party put it in their election program (CDA) the result was a coalition without them (Paars 1) and one of their most historic losses. It was a chance where the boomer generation could've shown solidarity, but chose themselves.

99,"&gt; From what I read, it is weird pseudo-scientific theory in which they claim to be the genuine Litvins

It's not 'pseudo-scienfitic', it was a term for inhabitants of the Grand Duchy, that's including Lithuanians, Poles or Ruthenians. That's why you get Polish poets writing 'Lithuania, my homeland' or the whole Vilnius affair in interwar period. Only after Lithuanian national revival the term Lithuanian was narrowed to ethnic Lithuanians from Lithuania proper. The term Belarus for this particular lands rose to prominence after partitions in Russian Empire.



&gt; Belarus didn't exist in Russian Empire, here you can see Minsk Governorate, Mogilev Governorate and Grodno Governorate coats of arms. So what exactly are you talking about?

Some parts of modern day Belarus were part of Vilna governorate and besides that:

&gt; After the first partition of Poland and Lithuania, Catherine the Great gave the Pahonia coat of arms to several towns in the newly acquired ethnic Belarusian and Latgallian territories, including Daugavpils, Ludza, Sebezh, Polacak, Nevel, Haradok, Viciebsk, Surazh, Velizh.

124,"&gt; In late June 2020, the Balkan Insight published a report based on the allegedly leaked data from the internal Government COVID-19 information system. This report stated that in reality, Serbia had recorded 632 deaths due to COVID-19 in the period from 19 March to 1 June 2020, which corresponds to 388 additional deaths caused by the virus that were not publicly reported.

&gt; Additionally, according to the leaked data, the number of people who became infected in Serbia from 17 June to 20 June was at least 300 per day, while public reports never accounted for more than 96 cases per day in the same period. Recovery figures were also disputed, with the Public Health Institute of Montenegro formally requesting an explanation from Serbian authorities in early June following a reported recovery of 4,000 patients in one day.

&gt; Earlier, the index case was also disputed after the Public Health Institute publicly revealed that the first case was registered a week before the officially reported index case.

Not a chance.

His overall impact in diplomacy is still extremely negative. The withdrawal from the Paris agreement alone would disqualify him from even being considered, not even mentioning withdrawing from UN bodies such as UNESCO and WHO. Breaking the Iran nuclear deal is another stain that will be held against him. His constant attacks against his European allies is yet another one, and Norway, the country that gives the Nobel Peace Prize, is among them. Him constantly giving Israel everything it wants in their conflict with Palestine would probably also be seen as detrimental for peace in the Middle East. Having two small Arab nations normalizing relations with Israel is indeed positive, but these achievements are quite small in contrast to everything else.

Majority Orthodox. Hence why we have numerous Albanian churches/monasteries as well as Byzantine ones from and before that time period in Albania. Especially Southern Albania.

The only churches, monasteries, and any ruins prior to the Ottomans taking over Kosovo are all Serbian. Every single one. How is that possible if Kosovars apparently were native to that area?

484,"Lucca is a city on the Serchio river in Italy’s Tuscany region. It’s known for the well-preserved Renaissance walls encircling its historic city center and its cobblestone streets. Broad, tree-lined pathways along the tops of these massive 16th- and 17th-century ramparts are popular for strolling and cycling. Casa di Puccini, where the great opera composer was born, is now a house museum.⁣

Lovely Lucca endears itself to everyone who visits. Hidden behind imposing Renaissance walls, its cobbled streets, handsome piazzas and shady promenades make it a perfect destination to explore by foot – as a day trip from Florence or in its own right. At the day's end, historic cafes and restaurants tempt visitors to relax over a glass or two of Lucchesi wine and a slow progression of rustic dishes prepared with fresh produce from nearby Garfagnana.⁣

⁣If you have a car, the hills to the east of Lucca demand exploration.

Hmm.  If I remember correctly from my reading on the extradition situation, France has not been willing to sign an extradition treaty with the US that would include extradition of French nationals to the US, and normally the US requires reciprocity for this.

France did commit to intra-EU extradition of nationals — I believe this was associated with the European Arrest Warrant — so they have moved a bit on the point, but as far as I know, they have not signed treaties to extradite nationals outside of that.

But because this particular ones target individuals not the system, i feel the effectiveness that you are seeking is diminished greatly. 

So in your example the Gay killing Ugandan, probably a government official, sanctioning him won't change that policy. At best it may hide it, at worse if the populace supports it, you have a narrative that is anti-european and will affect us the long run. Targeting sanctions at individuals rather than the system that creates and sustains them doesn't seem that effective. They are at the end of the day political statements, not an inducement to change behaviour as the system will replace the individual but will most likely carry on. 

Of course, you can make them more effective but they need to be combined with other actions (especially with local partners).

604,"&gt;I don't think that territorial waters problem that easy to resolve. According to this map it is a huge problem for Turkey. I mean there is no way. According to Treaty of Lausanne it should be 3nm.

What is the problem, however? Can you make a list naming the exact problems that will materialize if the territorial waters are increase to 12nm? What will you lose?
Again, I have conceded the point of the international water corridor, that DESPITE BEING UNCENESSARY, I suggest it can be done as an action of good faith from the side of Greece. What else Turkey will suffer in her eyes from 12nm?

Furthermore, can you please provide me with the article number that regulates territorial waters in the Treaty of Lausanne? 
I ask because I am fairly certain that territorial waters were created as a concept lots of years after Lausanne was signed, and it would be quite interesting to see how they could have named them as such. 

&gt;Show me any country that loses that much of EEZ due to the foreign islands. I don't know but no country would accept it. I can't make head nor tail of that how such small islands can restrain mainlands from its EEZ rights. This is not fair.

Check how much [EEZ Nicaragua](https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/124/17162.pdf) (page 12) is losing due to 3 Colombian islands that are also further away than Meis is from Greece. And keep in mind that in the above case the ICJ ruled in favor of Nicaragua, so what you see is the best case scenario, and realize this case is actually used by Turkey as a proof that Meis must have limited EEZ. 

Fairness if relative. Is it not fair to Turkey. It is fair to Greece and in the eyes of most of the other world. That said, i have already conceded that there is no need for Greece to have full Meis EEZ, despite her having the right to, and I am totally ok with give a large area of it to Turkey if it means that the other Aegean problems are also resolved.

&gt;But the question is: Is it the right thing to do so?

Alot of things are not right in the world. It doesn't mean that you can force people to change them if they don't want it. For example, Turkey still being on and bullying Norther Cyprus is not right, but it happens. Again, you can only force by military actions or by consequences if the rest of the world supports you.

&gt;85 million people with the longest coastline on the East Mediterranean against a few hundreds on a tiny island.

Again, what about the rest of the islands? The Libyan - Turkish maritime agreement ignores the EEZ south of Crete, the 5th largest island in the Mediterranean. Why is that if the problem is Meis' EEZ?",Greece,/r/europe/comments/iv75mt/greek_newspaper_headlines_fuck_off_mr_erdogan_in/g5r3tre/,Etoiles_mortant,1600468736

Have you removed all correlations (age, gender, social status, etc.) from the crime rate data, before comparing it?

Have you accounted for historical displays of violence among different ethnic groups, not just current state?

697,"&gt;You're so full of shit mate. This whole thread we've been talking about whether German cities have gotten more dangerous as a result of the ""refugee"" mass migration since 2014.

So again, what does what they kids in school have to do with whether the cities actually got more dangerous or not? You are repeatedly claiming that cities have gotten more dangerous, without ever proving that they have indeed gotten more dangerous than is normal for Germany. And please don't tell me again that 2019 was worse than 2013, because I'll again tell you that every year in living memory was worse than 2013, and that almost all of them were worse than 2019.

&gt;People whose opinions matter, people in even marginally powerful positions, don't base their worldview on Bild.

What the hell does that have to do with the public perception of safety? We are talking about the general public, not people in powerful positions.

And surprising nobody, it failed miserably. I mean, they essentially lost half the empire by the 1860s with the establishment of the dual monarchy. And by the time this kind of stuff was proposed in the 1900s, the Hungarians were now opposing it because they'd lose power as well.

Can you back this up? You can find in the references of the Wikipedia about the gulag that 1,600,000 died there. That is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the struggle of living in Russia, and should pretty much end the discussion of where quality of life was better. I am especially curious since you talked about calorie intake in the 80's, this seems completely made up because in the 70's the average calorie intake in the US was not TOO LOW, but TOO HIGH already... 15% was already obese then, and starvation was virtually non-existent. Also, calorie intake is the absolute bare minimum, what was healthcare like in Russia? I have heard stories from someone who lived in Russia before the end of the soviet union who said it was absolutely garbage. Also, note that Russia, just like Germany, was able to get the somewhat decent quality of life metrics by using a clever trick of just killing off everyone who did not make a valuable contribution, the western world could not use this because of human rights and stuff... I find it quite disturbing how you one the one hand stress the value of state benefits to citizens and how this communist rule was optimal for this, but on the other hand admit that indeed the death of the Ukrainians was just a necessary evil to get there...

&gt; Oh and not to forget the massive industrialization which allowed the USSR to win ww2

825,"&gt; I wasn't. Don't put words in my mouth, we already went over this in an earlier discussion. 

When I talked about what Russia was doing with invading countries you spun to blaming the West because  it allowed EU hypothetical membership to these countries. Either you're speaking from some kind of ""moral"" sense where Russia has the right to dictate the lives of the countries around it, or you're talking in  a geopolitical sense in which case it makes no sense that you would call what Russia does a natural struggle for power but you would criticise the West for doing the same when it's just as natural for it to be doing it. Either way there's a problem with what you said.   

&gt;What is it exactly about the war in Georgia that made any sense for example?    

Well ask fucking Russia.   

&gt;And how was everybody so surprised that this shit in Ukraine went down the way it did? Is that good planning?   

Good planning? You think that was  planned? Like honestly is it hard to believe Ukrainians would rather look to the EU with its far better economy, rights, rule of law, etc. than stay with Russia which has a habit of invading them, genociding them and trying to erase their culture? Even if the West planned *against* what happened in Ukraine they still wouldn't be able to stop it. It didn't help that Ukrainians were feeling betrayed when Yanukovich suddenly abandoned the association agreement with the EU in favour of getting closer to Russia.     
  


&gt;During the Cold War, NATO expansion was a strategic balancing act, every member was supposed to add to the security of the alliance. Then, after the collapse of the USSR, joining NATO basically became a right, it was all motivated by ideology, not strategy.    

If it was ideology and not strategy   then which NATO member was a mistake? Cause to me they all seem  strategically beneficial.  


&gt;Yup.  
 
So you go kill Ukrainians and then blame the West for making it happen?

Although I cannot agree more on at least some countries taking people in for the sake of easing to burden on Southern European border countries. It's not fair to those nations at all.

898,"The question boils down to whether the claimed so called ""computer implemented invention"" (CII) achieves a ""further technical effect"" that goes beyond the mere technical effects inevitably caused in the computer by running programs. The further technical effect is achieved if the software directly contributes to solving a technical problem. 

Take for example the computer game ""pacman"". Running its code on a computer undoubtedly has the technical effect of changing currents in the circuitry, switching transitors and providing visible output on the screen. However, there is no technical effect beyond that what is inherent to all computer programs. Thus, pacman is not a patentable computer implemented invention (CII).

On the other hand, think about the code running on a self driving car. Executing the code leads to the typical technical effects associated with running any other computer program. But it goes beyond that. The program controls the speed and heading of your car, taking away the burden of driving from the occupant. It thus produces the technical effect of providing automated individual transportation. The program may - provided that it conforms with the EPCs further requirements for patentability, in particular novelty and inventive step - be patented.

A straight forward way of answering the question ""Is this program patentable?"" is asking yourself ""Does the program reliably make things happen that are unquestionably outside of the computer itself?"" If the answer is yes, chances are high you may look at something that is not subject to the exclusion from patentability.

For further information see the ""Guidelines for Examination at the EPO"", it even has an index for all questions regarding CII.",,/r/europe/comments/iumtls/germany_will_violate_3_international_agreements/g5ptphw/,theyellowfromtheegg,1600446933

What? Poverty is bad, period. What social regulations are you talking about? You mean that ""it's ok to have more poor people as soon as there is regulations from the state"". It's not a smart way of thinking.

&gt;In a country where the Gini coefficient stays high after transfers and taxes, yes there I would not want to be poor.  
&gt;  
&gt;We lack a statistic which would be ""POVERTY RATE AFTER TRANSFERS AND TAXES""

The population living in poverty is a much more clear picture of real life than Gini.

&gt;You also missed the part where the median Belgian has double the wealth of the median American even though our gdp per capita is 16k lower. (10k lower ppp per capita)

Dude, no offence but you need to read the basics of economics. Imagine a guy who works in Wall Street and earns 250k per year. He just put down a deposit of 300k in an apartment of $1.5MM. It means that he owns to the bank $1.2MM, so his wealth is -1.2MM. A Belgian earning only 25k per year and paying rent has a much higher wealth than the American banker.

- if police stop trying to catch criminals for minor crimes (e.g. theft), because they're busy dealing with worse crimes. people stop reporting the minor crimes.

1008,"&gt;So Crimea wasn't  necessary then, at least if you only look at Russia trying to stop EU expansion.

If they only did Donbass, they'd lose the naval base.

&gt;But if that happens you would at least not blame the victim while saying the man can't be expected to control himself.

I'm pointing out that certain actions from one side will lead to certain actions from the other side. I'm not moralizing, you are.

&gt;And this isn't simply about the West or Russia. It's about what the smaller countries want. They have the right to chose their own path.

You might believe that, but it's not how things work out in reality. 

&gt;You're saying it's the West's responsibility not to ""provoke"" 

I'm not assigning responsibility, and if I was to be really cynical I'd say that I don't even care. I got paid for having my people go to Ukraine to fuck theirs up, so by all means, let's continue these kinds of conflicts, I want a bigger boat.

Again, you're the one approaching this from a standpoint of morals, rights and whatnot, but that makes for shit strategy. It is uncompromising, and it leaves no room for maneuver. 

Hell, you can't even think about the actions of your side, something you can actually influence, without having this knee jerk reaction of ""but it's Russia who is wrong, why would we change!?"".

This kind of thinking is the result of decades where West was able to run unchecked, but that's not the case anymore. A policy only grounded in your own ideology will not survive contact.
 

&gt;Russia not Russia's responsibility to act like a normal neighbour.

Again, Russia is an empire. I thought we agreed on that. What they're doing is par for the course. 

&gt;And frankly I'm not sure how much strategy there is in Russia's actions. They can't handle invading literally everything

They don't have to.

&gt;With their strategy they can make joining the EU harder 

It doesn't make it harder, it makes it impossible. 

&gt;but they're also making the West more attractive and Russia more hated. 

Well shit, it's hard to compete with all that money.

&gt;It looks like in the end they'll have several extra strips of land and a lot of angry neighbours that will make it more difficult for Russia to pursue any foreign policy than it would have been with friendly neighbours.

Letting this slide would be giving up on their foreign policy. Letting everybody do whatever the fuck they want, regardless of your own interests is not policy, it's the absence of one.",,/r/europe/comments/iv2qla/the_european_union_may_soon_get_its_own_magnitsky/g5pes89/,According_Machine_38,1600439847

1066,"""  Primary forests are forests without any signs of past human use and where ecological processes are not disrupted by human influence. These forests are of outstanding ecological value. They are an irreplaceable part of our natural heritage and critical for conserving forest biodiversity. In Europe, where millennia of land use have transformed forested landscapes, very few such primary forests remain, and these are mostly found in remote and relatively unproductive areas.

Even if scarce and irreplaceable, many of these forests are not legally protected and continue to be logged in Europe. The newly released 'EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030' explicitly recognizes the intrinsic value of primary and old-growth forests and the need to protect them. The question is: Which areas should be prioritised?

An international assessment of primary forest status

A research team of scientists from 28 institutions led by Dr Francesco Sabatini (iDiv; MLU) and Prof Tobias Kuemmerle (HU) has now presented the very first assessment of the conservation status of primary forests in Europe. With the help of a large spatial database on where the last primary forests in Europe are found - a database that took over five years to create - the team was able to tackle three crucial questions: 1) Are the remaining primary forests representative of Europe's forest types? 2) Where are these forests sufficiently protected? And: Where are so few primary forests left that forest restoration is needed?

Conservation challenges and opportunities in Europe

""While many primary forests are in fact well protected, we also found many regions where they are not - particularly where primary forests are still common,"" said lead author Sabatini. ""And in some cases, the level of protection is inadequate to ensure these forests will be conserved in the long term.""

The study also highlights that remaining primary forests are unevenly distributed across Europe. ""Some regions, particularly in Scandinavia and Finland as well as Eastern Europe, still have many primary forests. But often those countries do not realize how unique their forests are at the European scale and how important it is to protect them,"" explained Prof Tobias Kuemmerle (HU), senior author of the study. ""At the same time, we were shocked to see that there are many natural forests in Europe without any remains of primary forest at all, particularly in Western Europe.""

Primary forests in Europe are in a perilous state

Overall, the study shows Europe's primary forests are in a perilous state and their long-term protection should be a top priority. Where no primary forests are left, forest restoration is the only option. ""Restoring forests to resemble and function like primary forests will take a long time, but it is attractive because such forests will not only benefit biodiversity but also store a lot of carbon and, therefore, help mitigate climate change,"" said Kuemmerle. ""The good news is that there is a wide range of opportunities to restore primary forests even within existing protected areas, which means that restoration efforts would not necessarily require reducing the area of forests used for timber production.""

Expanding Europe's protected forest areas by 1% is enough

The researchers have calculated that even an expansion of the protected areas by only about 1% would suffice to protect most remaining primary forests in Europe. This corresponds to only two or three thousandths of the total European land area.

""Now is the time to be ambitious. There is a lot of momentum for forest conservation and restoration in Europe,"" said Sabatini, referring to the EU's recently released 'Biodiversity Strategy for 2030'. ""The new strategy explicitly recognizes the irreplaceable value of primary forests. Our study provides a foundation for putting this strategy into practice.""

That's the theory, but is there any observable effect of those sanctions?  Is Putin any less powerful, or is Russia acting any different on the world stage as a result? 

When you sanction a bunch of judges and police officials, what sway do you think they have with Putin? Do these sanctions even affect them, would the commander of the Chechen spetsnaz even have assets to be frozen?

Again, this analysis is valid if the aim of France and the UK was not actually to help Poland but just make a pro-forma declaration of war to save face. Which is of course pretty much what happened and why the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was the best move under the circumstances.

&gt;Stalin’s capacity for evil was already well known; when his people weren’t being starved, they were being rounded up for show trials.

1171,"&gt;  Everybody was shocked, or acted shocked, when Russia intervened in the Ukraine, but that's just a consequences of not listening what they were telling you all along. 

Everyone was shocked because Russia went that far. Not because they thought Russia had no ambitions of taking over land.   

&gt;I'm not sure that Russia ever claimed something like that, and the existence of a reset policy shows that things weren't that rosy.   

I think it was an uneasy truce with the potential hope of cooperation.  Certainly better than the present animosity.   


&gt;It's not a well meaning wish, it's a means to an end.   

Yes it is. Is it that hard to imagine people might wish other people live better lives?   I already said security issues are of course of higher priority.    


&gt;The delusion is in thinking that they actually want to be the way you want them to be, you just need to create favorable conditions for it.  

Like I said if it's a delusion  then the Russian government  and people are already entertaining it, in which case the West isn't misunderstanding them at all. Is Putin not trying to keep a veneer of democracy? Does Russia not pretend to honour human rights, fair elections, rule of law, presidential terms, freedom to do business, etc. etc. If Russian people don't want this then why not stop the theatre?


&gt;As for ""threatening Europe"", I don't know what that means. Russia makes their interests well known, it's just that in some cases they were ignored.  

It means pieces of Europe keep being invaded by Russia and others threatened by it.  



&gt;Russia is an empire, there's no doubt about that. They are not aiming for some kind of ideological triumph though, nor are they under the delusion that there is some magical trick that would make the West change course.

Putin really cared about this particular issue, so that's why he brought to bear the Russian intelligence apparatus in order to elect Donald Trump.

So will you admit you were incorrect or find some excuse for that? 

&gt;Except it is on topic, it's called an analogy... Trying to explain things to you through example isn't the same as changing the topic.

Ah so when you talk about it it's an analogy but when I talk about it it's a bad thing that you need to find reasons for... 

...okay 

&gt;I also ignored none of your points or questions, and so claiming I'm trying to change the topic makes zero sense, if I tried to change the topic, I would have avoided answering some of your questions. I haven't.

...you don't understand how changing the discussion from rromani people to african americans is changing the subject? 

...okay[2]

&gt;You explicitly blamed a minority for it's own poor social outcomes, when sociology and history show us they are in fact not the cause of them.

Alright let's make an exercise of imagination. 

You have a spot in school only you can go in. 

You choose not to go there. 

#HOW IN THE NAME OF FUCK IS IT YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S FAULT???? 

&gt;That implies other races/groups are better at causing good outcomes, and that's textbook racism.

No, that's completely irrelevant. 

I don't see how talking about people that don't go to school that are of a race other than the rroma is any relevant to a discussion about the rroma people. 

They're the only ones that are allowed to go in those spots. 

Why the fuck would I talk about anyone else not going in those spots?

That's like saying a discussion about tampons is mysoginistic because it only refers to women. No shit sherlock. 

&gt;How about hundreds?

Nope. Just one will do.

Still waiting for it btw.

&gt;One's fundamental human right to use their native language is an individual freedom / human right, and is not racism in any way.

...Choosing to ignore the fact that they receive special treatment in the education system...

...okay[3]

But sure let's talk about the native language. 

Which is Romanian.

Cause they're born in Romania. 

&gt;Nobody has ever suggested this. This is a textbook

What the fuck XD 

So when I equivalate receiving priority in education with receiving priority in public transport it's a strawman.

But when you compare african americans to rromani it's an analogy.

...okay[4]

Can you please stop trolling?

&gt;People should be allowed to use ther native language, it's a fundamental human right. End of line.

So you agree that they should stop receiving special treatment? 

Glad we're on the same page! 

&gt;You were saying? I'm actually writing it the exact way my Roma colleague did in emails.

Are you blind? 

That you are spelling their name improperly. 

""Roman"" or ""Romani"" is... you know... The people from Rome. 

&gt;You are blaming the Roma people for their own bad social outcomes, this implies a group-wide disfunction, and therefore inferiority

I'd appreciate it if you stopped putting words in my mouth. 

I said something that applies to everyone indifferent of race. 

&gt;You reap what you sow 

I didn't blame anyone for anything, I just stated a fact. 

&gt;They're allowed to speak/learn in their own language and schools and colleges have special slots just for them

I've given them all I could give

They receive special treatment and still have ""bad social outcomes"", how the hell am I the one to be blamed for it? 

&gt;I am defending native people's right to use their native languages, which is a fundamental human right, and is in fact not racist.

But you aren't. 

[Here's a definition](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/native-language) and excuse me for not having a PHD in wikipedia and giving you actual knowledge that you knew if you went to college. 

Their native language is the same as everyone else's who's born in the country. Excepting that they receive special treatment and are allowed to learn and study in a language that isn't native to this land. 

What you are doing however is casually ignoring the racist fact that they have special slots in school/highschool/college that only they can go to.

1255,"Just to add: this leverage always existed but before this past January it was the UK’s. The combination of the GFA and Brexit always meant that either:

* The U.K. has to treat NI differently,

* The E.U. has to treat Éire differently, or

* A border goes up between Éire and NI, violating the GFA

Previously, the prospect of a no-deal looked set to put pressure on the E.U. to isolate Éire or Éire to erect a border. This was why Boris was always trying to empower himself to ignore Parliament’s demand to avoid a crash-out; the threat of no deal was something the E.U. was concerned about. The E.U. was unprepared to countenance this, and said “if you screw the GFA we screw your economy” and balanced out the threat. When the WA was signed, the pressure to deliver a deal was shifted to the U.K. as now No-Deal would result in NI being isolated by the U.K. or the U.K. erecting a border with Éire. This was fair because Brexit was the U.K.’s idea so if they make a hames of it they should be the ones dealing with the fallout, not other countries who never wanted this mess in the first place. 

Boris signed up to that and here we are. Now the U.K. wants to shift the consequences of No-Deal away from itself and back to the E.U., which is understandable but still not acceptable.

Let's see. What is the first word of that sentence ?...

""while"".

How odd, that's not capitalized. Shouldn't it be «While"" ??

«while the use of racial quotas for college admissions was concurrently  ruled unconstitutional by the Court in Gratz v. Bollinger (2003).»

That's super strange. It's almost like the sentence doesn't start with ""while"", and you cherry-picked the half of the sentence that makes it sound like you are correct, while when one takes the entire sentence, it shows \*I'm\* correct.

This couldn't be. You couldn't be a quote-mining liar, you can't be \*that\* dishonest.

Ok, I still need to be sure, let's check the rest of the sentence.

« Affirmative action as a practice was partially upheld by the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) in [*Grutter v. Bollinger*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger) (2003) »

This must be some kind of mistake. Somebody hacked your account, and changed your message to look like you quote-mined, right ? It can't be you're that fucking disgusting.

If it was \*after\* at least you could say you just missed it, stopped before you read it. But it's \*before\*, so you \*must\* have read it, which means you \*must\* have known it was supporting my point, and knowingly chose to remove it. This demonstrate with no possible doubt you were not being honest here. Which means talking to you about all this is completely pointless.

I was sincerely interested in helping you discover how racist you are ( or in you showing me how you aren't, I'm open to the possibility I'm wrong, which you clearly aren't ), but you are making it clear you are not honest enough to actually talk to.

I sincerely hope you will recognize you were being dishonest with the quote-mine, apologize, and ask that we move on. If you did that, I'd answer the rest of your comment point by point.

1283,"There's some two thousands and somethings years of history within that st Peter itself is from 67, mosaics span from late Rome to early medieval ages, like 600, 700, 800 eras of europe, outside the Byzantine empire, has quite little remains, and of these, a portion are there, within that basilica, well served by architectural designs and sculptures by Michelangelo and those of the greatest exponent of baroque sculpture, Bernini from just three hundred years ago, really recent actually. But still you can get old stuff, you can find stuff from six hundred years before that, at the height of the medieval renaissance (which predates the actual renaissance) which had its height in Europe in central and northern Italy - giving birth to the infamous rift between North and south, and giving ground for the actual renaissance. You can find stuff from almost all the centuries that came after the birth of Christ, not only in the museum, whose jobs is to collect artifacts, but in the actual church itself.

Its paintings are not paintings, but mosaics with some ridiculously small pieces, there's so much gold used to build it, and the art itself and the sculptures are fantastic, some of the most valuable art pieces were built there

The church is pretty big, let's make a comparison with the St Paul's cathedral in London:

it's 160% as long, precisely twice (200%) as wide, 120% as tall - however that last statistic is including the dome, for both buildings, if we exclude the dome, that is if we calculate the nave's height, you get 177% the height. 

Edit:I forgot the most important detail, whenever you read that it is the best example of renaissance architecture, it's wrong. It's the best example of baroque architecture, which is 150 later roughly, so quite distinct

To clear it up before some angry redditors attack me, the St Peters basilica is the one bigger on all dimensions, and the percentage are as compared to, not more to, that the building is 200% the width means it's twice as wide, it isn't thrice as wide.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/iv0jl1/ray_of_sunlight_in_st_peters_basilica_rome/g5ov4ko/,Prisencolinensinai,1600426436

1291,"I've heard this one plenty in my life to refute it. Many in the older generation believe ""they've seen it all"" and can ""see things from different perspective"", while the youth are ""brainwashed"". They think they saw the Soviet system through and ""never believed the government propaganda"", to the point that they claim they were not affected by it at all and furthermore, are also ""immune to the Western propaganda"".

This despite the fact that many sociological studies reveal how this generation thinks alike in the post-Soviet world. So how did an Estonian suddenly become more similar to a Moldovan, rather than a Finn, which geographical and cultural proximity would suggest? It can't be that same Soviet system, can it. ""It's because Finns are brainwashed and we are not.""

This is how many of the former communists became the most patriotic nationalists overnight. They fought against the imperalist Moscow and now they fight against imperialist Brussels. Meanwhile, they long for the days where ""people were unified"", forgetting that in a functional democracy, having constant political rivarly and competition of ideas is the normal, not a nuisance.

Some even go against the status quo and enforce the law even on their superiors (noteworthy example being *Marian Godina*, he became somewhat of a 'celebrity' by going against the system, luckily he had exposure and support, others in that position usually get demoted or sacked).

Regarding the pay, the largest chunk of the pensions go to the superiors(read: old corrupt farts), some are absurdly high even by western standards. They receive a special pension (literally that's what they are called ""special pensions""), some are as high as 10-20k Euros/**month** (in a country where the average, **not median**, monthly wage is just below 700 Euros/mo). Did I mention that these special pensions are given alongside normal pensions along with other benefits?

Political parties have promised to tackle this issue, this inequality, but they all fear to actually dismantle this absurd *special pension* income that only a select few receive. The absurd part is that you can even work for only a couple of months and receive this special pension in full for the rest of your life.",Transylvania,/r/europe/comments/iuj5rt/the_10_stations_in_the_new_metro_line_opened_in/g5ooreo/,Fuckanator,1600419220

1. Japan does not have 2,5 million foreign experts. At most million (it takes time to dig deep into this, but there are only 2.5 times as many Americans in Japan as in Sweden, while the population is 12 times as large). Its job market is not particularly globalised and this is a weakness in the Japanese economy - there is a significant barrier in attracting foreign competence to offices local to Japan.
2. My point was *only* about how the Danish hostility against foreigners *in general* tends to make Denmark perceivably more xenophobic. Even Swedish people can be shut out in Denmark for being foreign.
3. Not all foreigners are experts. **No shit**. But in the case of Sweden, people from e.g. Germany living in Sweden are predominantly experts.

More metro? Where do you want to put it? The problem with Randstad is that all the cities, Amsterdam included, aren't dense enough for the metro. Sure, you could try and think of places like Osdorp or IJburg, but is it really worth the money?

The sheer fact that trains can already go 140km/h is fucking insane, man. A regional train (sprinter) between Hilversum and Almere goes 140km/h. In Eastern Europe, those tend to go 80km/h at best. Upgrading to high speed is much more cost-effective when you're starting out with low speed. While I'm also a fan of high speed trains, I acknowledge that Netherlands is a hell to build them due to multiple factors, like dense population in rural areas. Besides, if the government wanted to build HSL Oost, they would've done so by now. It's really not a money issue, but the Dutch politicians mentality of 'this costs money, we can't do that'.

NS is already working on the capacity. There are renovations all over, tracks are improved, bottlenecks are removed, more trains will run next year on 10-minute basis. Yes, people of reddit, you read it right - trains on key destinations are running every 10 minutes in NL. It's basically a massive metro system, except above ground. That's practically unheard of beyond Japan.

So yeah. Give Bulgaria the metro. They are still ages behind NL. One metro line won't change that, but it's a step in the good direction.

1469,"They are seemingly excluded when you look at [Article 52](https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/1973/e/ar52.html) of the EPC which deals with what is patentable (or seen as technical matter in the eyes of the European Patent Office):

&gt; The following in particular shall not be regarded as inventions within the meaning of paragraph 1:


&gt; (a) discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods;


&gt; (b) aesthetic creations;


&gt; (c) schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs for computers;


&gt; (d) presentations of information.

So Computer Programs are taken to be non-technical. But then you also have:

&gt; The provisions of paragraph 2 shall exclude patentability of the subject-matter or activities referred to in that provision only to the extent to which a European patent application or European patent relates to such subject-matter or activities **as such**.

The ""As Such"" is doing a lot of legwork here, it basically means that there are exceptions to programs for computers that can be granted. And for this you need to look at case law. An often cited one is the [Vicom case](https://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t840208ep1.html) from the 80s. They first tried to claim 'a method of digitally filtering a data array' but it was seen that amending it to 'a method of digitally processing **images in the form of a two-dimensional data array**' was enough to make it patentable, in general how I've come to understand it the computer program in itself is not technical and thus not patentable. But including some technical means of tangible application will make it applicable.

I cannot really comment yet on the unitary patent. The question really becomes about German patent law which I'm unfamiliar with.

You can't even pay Romania to take care of its roma population, the EU has tried. Orban is an actual fascist dictator yet Hungary still gets billions in support. Italy, Greece and Spain have mismanaged their economies for decades, the EU bails them out and when asked to get their shit together they throw tantrums.


The EU went too far, too fast, and is now an unwieldy mess which siphons money from well-behaved countries to countries with widespread corruption, mismanaged economies and atrocious human rights records. 
A system for sanctioning misbehaving countries must be put in place, membership and voting rights could be tiered according to some specified parameters which must be met. Italy is never going to vote against free money from the EU slush fund, so they shouldn't get a say. Hungary is never going to vote to declare Orban a dictator, so they shouldn't get a say.

1532,"&gt;There are 15 million Kurds in Turkey for starters most of them don’t even live in Kurdistan anymore and even though I don’t have any statistics I can say with confidence 1/3 1/4 of Kurds live in Istanbul.

There are no official figures because Turkey would not dare to properly research and give an accurate figure of the Kurdish population in Turkey, so like you I don't have exact stats so yeah maybe I could be wrong, but 10 years ago it was 14-15 million based off some surveys asking about languages in Turkey so what about those who did not include they spoke Kurdish or in fear hid their Kurdish identity, finally a bit of population growth added in.

I read that there are 3-4 million Kurds in Istanbul alone (estimates made in the late 90's) with a large population diaspora in Izmir and other areas also, so I doubt that there can only be 10 million or so Kurds in the Kurdish region. That population comes from the 90's where Turkey was basically destroying thousands of Kurdish villages and displacing people from the towns, creating military zones so Kurds didn't just feel like settling to Istanbul with full desire.

Kurdish cities like Diyarbakir for example has a population of just under 2 million. I think it's more like 10 to 15 million in the Kurdish region maybe more.

&gt;I can tell you with full confidence that 50% votes in referendum cannot be achieved in enough regions to separate Kurdistan and those who want to do it and are making you believe there’s some kind of oppression to Kurds(In Turkey) are really the ones in Iraq and Syria who have been openly hostile to Turkey for decades.

1557,"**More Police vs Community Driven Outreach**

There was a US mayor that described the difference (perhaps I can find the speech) and he was absolutely right. Police are a good thing if trained and used properly but they should never be the cure all. They should never be the mentally councilors, they should never be the sole peace brokers and they diffidently shouldn't be the ones that are a cure-all for violence when its the ignorance of others thats driving that violence to begin with. 

Instead, police should be used only when theres no other option. Just got robbed? Yeah, okay use them. Got robbed because a growing trend of hate and ignorance? Well, yeah police should fill out a report but the money from the government shouldnt go to more police, it should go to outreach for those that could be victimised but also those that are doing the crimes. Help prevent crimes before they happen and no I'm not talking about China's 1984 dystopia but rather grass root campaigns, outreach to religious groups in particular too.

&amp;#x200B;

When Americans were saying ""defund the police"" and I was like, do they mean completely? Then I see, yes many are saying 100% get rid of policing! It put a smile on my face, reminded me of something redditors would say. The reality is, trained police that are used as a last resort and not a first resort is good for our communities. Having them  being the community council on the streets might seem kind and good but what it does is tangle the police more and more into more problems instead of police working with community groups created for and by local citizens where anyone is free to join (except Bill Gates, he's trying to kill us all with vaccines!!!!, Oprah too).

People need to understand the difference between citizen driven help and throwing police at everything. I think there'd be a lot fewer dickish cops too if they weren't an all-of-the-above solution. And yeah, there are dick cops in Sweden regardless of what r/Worldnews tells you about how utopia like they all are (maybe compared to the US they are?).",,/r/europe/comments/iugae3/swedens_new_epidemic_clanbased_crime_the_spectator/g5oau5g/,saltyswedishmeatball,1600405958
1558,"&gt;I wouldn’t and I would love to have Kurdistan in our border instead of Iraq and Syria. I will also support having good relationship with them but just like anybody I don’t want my country loosing land.

But why do you care so much about the land? What's it to you? I ask not just you personally, but in general why Turks are so eager to hold onto other peoples land.

The Kurds are clearly majority in those areas, they have also claim to it since during the Ottoman times, even before that.

&gt; That’s me personally though I don’t think people have much of an opinion on this but Erdogan saw Rojava as expansion opportunity so who knows what the current government thinks. I think stable Kurdistan will be good addition to the Middle East. 

I believe that's exactly why global powers like the US and Russia are not behind an independent Kurdistan in the middle east, because that would end quite a few conflicts.

&gt; Honestly I care about Turkey not about Kurds having a country. It will also be safer for Turkey having a stable Kurdistan in southern border rather than those two. Probably if people were not brainwashed that all Kurds outside of Turkey are terrorist no Turks would objected Kurdistan existing outside of the border of Turkey.

Fair honesty in my opinion, I have actually read similar arguments.

&gt;My only worry will be them having claims later on their existence but nothing that can’t be solved with a treaty and good relations.

1632,"They don't need to legally enforce anything.

The opening of markets made our agriculture mostly obsolete as we cannot compete economically with prices from Spain and France, except in very specific products in which we specialize. 

Farmers were bought off by the thousands. So were fishermen. EU gave money to shut down micro explorations disguised as ""help"" instead of ensuring local sustainability with local production across the EU.

The reason why our fields are abandoned is because local production became useless. We can't even sell local production without being force to follow endless ""safety"" procedures (like, no mad cow disease ever came from local farming) that turn anything grown or raised in small local farms utterly expensive.

Only by back dooring products can some people survive.

And massive exploitations are both impossible to create in this marginal gains market control by a few puppet masters, as well as extremely negative for the environment.

So yeah. A country like mine (Portugal), that could literally produce everything himself, isn't really allowed to as we do not have the power to tweak markets and give incentives to national production.

That's why a huge part of products come from abroad. This is a nonsensical approach to sustainability of both local populations and the environment. The EU is a ultra capitalistic system that has a sickening obsession with out of control trade. 

They should always finance local exploitations first in order to decentralize productions units. Nations should be as self relying as possible and ONLY THEN trade with each others. 

The day will come where a real pandemic or war will appear and large parts of Europe will have NO CAPACITY OF SUSTAIN THEMSELVES because everything comes from somewhere else.

you should look at a physical geography map then. The Great Eurasian Plane is easy to invade as it has no natural barriers. So putting as much land between you and the enemy makes sense. This explains Russian geopolitics in the last 400 years. 

They actually didn't have enough land.   Germans were close to taking over the Russian core and the Caucasus.

**Turkey’s Two-State Proposal Riles Divided Cyprus Before Vote**


By 
Selcan Hacaoglu
 and 
Firat Kozok


Turkey on Thursday explicitly floated the concept of a two-state solution for divided Cyprus, a proposal sure to alarm the Mediterranean island’s internationally recognized administration and hobble a proposal to resume reunification talks.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that he was looking to restart reunification negotiations after the Oct. 11 presidential elections in the northern third of the island, which is dominated by Turkish Cypriots and hosts tens of thousands of Turkish troops.
UN Says Current Talks to Reunify Cyprus End Without Agreement


But in a statement Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said Turkey sees no common ground or vision for a solution in Cyprus.
If talks aren’t based on the concept of equal power-sharing between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the island’s governing institutions, “then there is need for a new negotiation process based on sovereign equality of the two sides,” Aksoy said. “Otherwise, Turkey will not go into a new negotiation process based on methods that proved to be unsuccessful in the past.”


Turkey Accuses U.S. of Fueling Tensions With Pompeo Visit
While Turkey has previously hinted at such a resolution, it’s never articulated it so explicitly. Only a day before, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said “we believe that only an overall solution and a reunification will ensure peace once and for good.”
Thursday’s proposal drew a swift response from the Cypriot governmen.


The announcement makes clear that “Turkey is trying to torpedo, before it even starts, a new effort” by the UN, government spokesman Kyriakos Kousios said in an emailed statement. Furthermore, it ignores the agreement to restart dialogue from where it stopped in Crans Montana, he said, referring to the Swiss resort where a round of talks in 2017 failed to reach a deal.


The Cypriot government officially has sovereignty over the entire island, yet Cyprus has in effect been divided since Turkish forces captured its northern third in 1974, following a coup attempt in which a military junta in Athens sought to unite Cyprus with Greece.
The Turkish minority’s self-proclaimed state in the north, formed in 1983, is recognized only by Ankara. Frictions between the sides and with Turkey have grown over competing claims to any energy resources discovered off the island’s shore.


The shift in Turkey’s rhetoric came shortly after the U.S. unsettled Ankara by easing an arms embargo on the island and announcing plans to build a military training center there. Turkey could increase its military presence in the north of the island depending on its needs in the eastern Mediterranean, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN-Turk television late Wednesday.


Ankara’s hardline stance also reflects the rising nationalism among Turkish Cypriots. An early September poll of almost 5,000 people showed 81% supported the creation of two equal states, with the rest backing a federation with the Greek Cypriot side, said Murat Gezici, head of the Gezici polling company.


The Conflicts That Keep Turkey and Greece at Odds: QuickTake
Some of the presidential candidates, including leading contender Prime Minister Ersin Tatar, are challenging incumbent President Mustafa Akinci with campaigns focusing on an independent Turkish Cypriot state rather than a power-sharing model. If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff will be held.
“Right after the elections, I will bring alternative suggestions for a solution other than a federation,” Tatar said in statement on Wednesday. “There will be a new era during which our relations will be strengthened with Turkey.”",,/r/europe/comments/iuuysy/turkeys_twostate_proposal_riles_divided_cyprus/g5nprek/,AQMessiah,1600393141

&gt;The issue is simply about teaching kids what is right and wrong according to the christian faith, that is what it is to raise someone as a christian.

It's fine to teach homosexuality as a sin but kids must also be taught about not discriminating against others because they have different skin color, religion, or sexual orientation. Nobody is saying we must teach kids to be gay. It doesn't work like this anyways.

Overall, it's a mix of two internal crisises. One is new division of government posts between PiS and two minor satellite parties, far right SP and liberal-conservative Porozumienie. This is less about opinions, more about power and money.

Second, is Jarosław Kaczyński himself pushing for ""animals' rights law"". This is his **personal** idea (being an animal lover is one of his few positive sides), which he already tried to push trough around a year ago, but cancelled due to upcoming elections. What's funny here, is that this law (considered ""leftist bullshit"" etc.) is mostly opposed by both majority of PiS politicians (save few exceptions, mostly old-guard Kaczyński loyal friends, from when he was a leader of centre-right PC party in early 1990s), and many of PiS' voters, especially rural ones. It's also war declaration against quite powerful business lobby (it's not only about fur farming, but also meat industry).

What's unique here, is that issue divides both ruling coalition (with SP and 1/3 of PiS MPs being staunchly against), and opposition (KO and Left are in favour, KP and Konfederacja against). So, Kaczyński could easily pass it with cross-party support... but that would weaken his personal position, showing he has no complete control over PiS.

You're actually trying to make this seem like a massive deal, when most people agree with the BLM movement, and Trump (the rightwing populist who was supposed to stop this) is historically unpopular. Do you think in 25 years we'll be overrun by rioting black people or something?

2065,"That (targeting communities) is what Americans are doing. How's that working out for producing a cohesive integrated society?

But, I agree with your point that racial segregation lets crime thrive. The way to fight that is to prevent racial segregation. Make sure that everybody lives everywhere. Make sure that all children go to the same schools. Make sure that  you don't build ghettos and populate them exclusively with low-income families, which overwhelmingly means immigrants.

I live in Slovenia. We have a lower immigrant rate than Sweden, but higher than Italy and comparable to France and the UK. Sure, you could say that our immigrants are mostly culturally similar to us, but our nationalists would vehemently disagree with that.

But, when we built the ""commie blocks"", it was housing for everybody, not just immigrants. When cheap loans caused the explosion of private house building in the 1970s and the 1980s, it was everybody that built those houses, not just the natives.

And at the time of the most massive immigration we didn't have private schools, and even now, only a tiny proportion (well under 1%) go anywhere else than their local public school. It's practically impossible for an immigrant child to grow up in Slovenia without integrating in the Slovenian society.

But sure, we still have organized crime, largely run by immigrants. We're on the Balkanian drug route after all. But only an extreme idiot, or somebody who grew up in an isolated village and never took a peek out of it, would think that the government should target the ""Montenegrin community"" in some way because of the Montenegrin mafia. We don't even have a ""Montenegrin community"", we just have people who happen to be Montenegrin by ethnicity or nationality.

**Edit:** I should also say that we had a bit of a gang problem in the 1980s and the 1990s. It wasn't dissimilar to the Swedish thing. Some kids from the local blocks started up gangs, some of them got mixed up with serious mob and obtained guns and shot a few people. The problem was solved in the short term by the police cracking down on those kids (not on their ""communities""), most of them went home crying to their mommies and a few ended up in prison. In the long term, the problem was solved by the whole generation growing up and the demographics in the blocks naturally changing as a consequence.",,/r/europe/comments/iugae3/swedens_new_epidemic_clanbased_crime_the_spectator/g5m74w1/,7elevenses,1600368356

Well, guess what. East Europe is not buying this. We were the colonized, not the colonizer. We didn't venture in Africa to capture slaves, we were enslaved by the Ottomans, but also by Austria-Hungary, Russia or some incarnation of the German Empire. We're definitely imperfect and flawed just like any other human inhabited area, but we paid in blood, no exaggeration, for our nations.

It sucks now but with stagnant wages in the west I think we should get to a similar level of parity in 15 years. I don’t know the situation in Latvia, but migration to Lithuania was positive for the first time since independence last year, and this year even more so. I would even argue a faster level of development wouldn’t even be that possible. the problem is , is that we in Eastern Europe are so exposed to the wealth of the west that the simple comparison makes us feel a lot poorer than in reality we are. We are close to overtaking some southern countries in terms of average wages (Greece, Portugal).

2248,"Simple.

Economies in the EMU collapsing dumps the entire Dutch economy in a massive crisis. It ain’t gonna be fun for the average Dutch dude to see their job disappear, the financial system going haywire and the Dutch exports taking a dump if the EMU faces a massive crisis. 

If you’re gonna disband the EMU, you better take a few decades to do it slowly and in a controlled manner. 

Also, higher pension age is because of people growing older while the working population not growing sufficiently. An easy fix is far more immigration. 

We haven’t had free universities for a very long time now and the Dutch government itself decided to make it more expensive to spend more on the quality of the universities themselves. 

Exact same with hospitals. The government itself decided that the spending was not worth it and we ought to introduce private insurers in the market.

Edit: Klaas Knot (president of Dutch Central Bank) actually feared that not committing to those payments to those nations puts the EMU and the entire EU at risk. So yeah, it’d be really stupid to not pay. 

And for the record, in case we would leave and get our own currency, it’ll be fixed so hard to the euro that it makes little difference for Dutch interest rates anyway.

One has to ask why there is a sudden unwillingness to fund Turkey's large current account deficits. After all, a negative current account means a positive capital account.  I don't think it is sufficient to say it is just about loose monetary policy (although it is a factor). If you look at EMs, it is an across-the-board phenomenon. FDI is sticky, but portfolio inflows are not, and it is the latter which have been withdrawn from most EMs.

Those who were reliant on foreign funding to support unsustainable consumption, like Turkey, have either been forced to correct their growth model and accept lower growth rates. Turkey has not done that. Instead it has chosen to pump massive credit into the system, as I have pointed out, to artificially boost growth rates in the short run, but widening the current account instead of adjusting.

&gt;  
&gt;Recent events in Belarus surprised Russian leaders as much as everyone else. Some observers in Moscow speculated about a controlled succession in the country. But Moscow’s choice to force a weakened Lukashenka into making concessions he would have otherwise resisted can largely be explained by Russian military thinking. The position of Belarus is much more important to Russia than that of Armenia or any other Central Asian ally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russia’s goal in its neighbourhood is to regain influence, **not to be surrounded by neutral, self-sufficient buffer states**. The Kremlin’s attempts to increase and institutionalise its power and control in Belarus – particularly through the Union State – are likely intended to prevent Belarus from escaping the Russian orbit. Deeper integration, a common currency, shared military structures, political control via common decision-making, and an expanded Russian military presence in Belarus have been on Moscow’s wish list for years.

Currently, there is no such  neutral, self-sufficient buffer states. Countries are either this side that side, except Switzerland by its political stance.",,/r/europe/comments/iu9dmh/belarus_and_armenia_how_russia_handles_uprisings/g5jbft1/,PLUTO_HAS_COME_BACK,1600305863

2598," Hmm, it will be a difficult expression. First of all, irregulars are not mercenaries but voluntary units. The Ottomans ruled over a large geography that would not use mercenaries. Irregulars are also an elite unit until the 19th century. They were brought up to instill fear into the enemy and to demoralize the enemy army. Generally, the most casualties (in proportion) in wars were given by irregulars.  To portray an elite union in the Ottoman Empire as a scattered looting community is also mind-blowing. It may be the secban class, which usually performs looting and looting across borders. The fact that all religions caused them to kill each other directly and indirectly made them think that they were not committing a crime. By looking at what the Austrians did to the Hungarians, we can see that every state was brutal at that time (like this period).    
Many international organizations also accepted the ethnic cleansing carried out by the PYD in northern Syria. Stop playing the victim anymore. The state will of course try to place its own men. You call it a crime and you are right because all states have been committing crimes for centuries. Turkey's What's he doing in Syria? But they are there and they fight. Just like many other unnecessary states. 

   
they were certainly killed and they killed others. I also understand that they want to break away from a collapsing empire and establish their own state. But it is also foolish to expect the other party to remain silent. If we look at the chronicles of that time, regardless of what you call the Armenian relic, the genocide, it mostly works for the Kurdish tribes. The looting is incredible. On the other hand, Armenians set fire to many cities while passing from the east. Kurds and Armenians did not like each other at that time. A logical reason. The Ottomans do not want to deal with the Armenians while fighting on many fronts. 

   
It is different to say that there is looting, trying to dissolve the population in the region is different. The fact that there was a lot of Greek population in Anatolia at that time is that while many Turkish tribes went to the Balkans, the population there was also sent to Anatolia. But the incineration is correct. Greece did the same, and the exchange is a joint decision of both sides. In other words, it is a nice propaganda to try to demolish the things that two states do to each other. 

   
Syria is a drama. I do not think Turkey is also very happy to draw a table there. But while Russia was bombing hospitals, the PKK was doing ethnic cleansing, the Assad Regime was slaughtering its own people, while the jihadists ruled in Idlib, (tell me who carried them there by cars, or even go see where the Ishid militants were transferred after Raqqa fell). , focus on what Turkey is doing the show focused on who you are typing. Turkey innocent? I do not think so. But there are no innocents there, and if we rank among them, it is certain that they are not in the first place. 

   
By the way, I am a Kurd. I am doing civil engineering in Northern Iraq. My house in Turkey. Even here, the PKK is a formation that everyone sees as a problem. every movement is useful to Turkey, where the PKK has done. The PKK was first left alone and then presented as an excuse to interfere in the affairs of other countries. Sound familiar? Turkey is not innocent in the region, but also that we must look first who use these tactics. So don't search right or wrong here. Those who take refuge in stupid excuses always serve the purposes of others. 

 We can guess what a militarist state, which displaced millions of Armenians and killed hundreds of thousands, would do to a communist and Kurdish racist organization (how do they go together?). Let those who follow them consider why they are abandoned and revealed before every political election.",,/r/europe/comments/itsp96/un_points_finger_at_turkey_over_rights_abuses_in/g5ivw4u/,3WayToDie,1600297145
2599,"One day, a scorpion looked around at the mountain where he lived and decided that he wanted a change. So he set out on a journey through the forests and hills. He climbed over rocks and under vines and kept going until he reached a river.

The river was wide and swift, and the scorpion couldn't see any way across.

Suddenly, he saw a frog sitting in the rushes by the riverbank on the other side of the river. He decided to ask the frog for help getting across.

""Hello Mr. Frog!"" called the scorpion across the water, ""Would you be so kind as to give me a ride on your back across the river?""

""Well now, Mr. Scorpion! How do I know that if I try to help you, you won't try to kill me?"" asked the frog hesitantly.

""Because,"" the scorpion replied, ""If I try to kill you, then I would die too, for you see I cannot swim!""

Now this seemed to make sense to the frog. Nevertheless he asked, ""How do I know you won't just wait till we get to the other side and then kill me?""

""Because you see,"" said the scorpion, once you've taken me to the other side of this river, I will be so grateful for your help, that it would hardly be fair to reward you with death, now would it?""

So the frog agreed to take the scorpion across the river. He swam over to the bank and settled himself near the mud to pick up his passenger. The scorpion crawled onto the frog's back and the frog slid into the river. The muddy water swirled around them, but the frog stayed near the surface as he swam so the scorpion would not drown.

Halfway across the river, the frog suddenly felt the sharp sting of the scorpion's stinger in his back. A deadening numbness began to creep into his limbs.

""You fool!"" croaked the frog, ""Now we shall both die! Why on earth did you do that?""

The scorpion shrugged, and did a little jig on the drowning frog's back.

""I could not help myself. It is my nature.""

Then they both sank into the muddy waters of the swiftly flowing river.",,/r/europe/comments/iu59cf/the_european_visionaries_decided_that_difference/g5ivyop/,tgrandiflora,1600297184

2750,"From Wikipedia:

&gt;	In 2007, declining birth rates and demographic change led to a new law, the ""Parenting Benefits and Parental Leave Law"" (Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeit-Gesetz). This change in family policy had mainly two aims: to reduce parents' financial loss in the first year after childbirth, and to encourage fathers to actively participate in childcare by taking parental leave.

&gt;	With this shift in paradigm, a better work-life balance and less support for the male breadwinner model was targeted. This was part of a ""sustainable family policy"" promoted by German unification and European integration with the underlying objective to raise birth rates by providing financial incentive.

&gt;	The law's impact was mainly perceived positively with men reporting high motivation to take leave. So far this has not been reflected in official statistics, but Susanne Vogl concludes that if there is a general willingness of men to participate in parental leave the new Parenting Benefits regulations will help facilitate the actual decision to take a leave.

The last paragraph is from 2012. it has changed a lot since then.

And the corruption part is mainly cause she hired a lot of consultants. That was seen as excessive by many people. But most of the money went to IT consultants cause the ministry didn’t have the knowledge to do this by their own. This last part is often overlooked in this discussion.

2784,"Basically it refers to a specific group of ideas that were intimately tied to the original LGB movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and to those movements as they have subsequently developed (eg with the added role of ‘transgenderism’). As a group of ideas these are not totally independent as they are also closely linked to the wider ideological developments within the ‘new left’ of the same period.

Today the ideology exists with a number of key principles at its core, including: 

A **fixed essentialist view of sexuality**- that each person has a fixed ‘sexual orientation’ by which they can be identified. Hence every person is a ‘heterosexual’, a ‘homosexual’, a ‘bisexual’, an ‘asexual’, or another such term. This view of sexuality starts to come about in the late 19th century in the work of people like Richard von Krafft-Ebing.

A **constructivist view of gender**- what makes a woman a woman, or a man a man, being overwhelmingly (sometimes solely) their societal role. Manhood and womanhood are seen as essentially cultural phenomena. This has its roots in De Beauvoir’s existentialism and Butler’s gender performativity. This also has some tension with the previous essentialist view of sexuality.

The **unassailablity of self-identity**- the idea that that someone’s self-identity in sexuality or gender is a dominant part of their personhood. A simple questioning of someone’s self-identity or their ideological commitments is seen as an existential attack on that person or wider group. Hence you see people who hold to a traditional account of marriage being labelled ‘homophobes’, and people that question transgenderism as wanting to wipe people from the Earth. And hence von der Leyen’s quotation above about “being yourself”.

Linked to the previous point, the **importance hinged on one’s own self-discovery**. A person’s self-identity in terms of sexuality and gender is seen as something they have to “find out for themselves” and that person (or their group) becomes the sole legitimate authority when it comes to issues linked to that self-identity. Any conflicting view is ‘heteronormativity‘ or ‘cisnormativity’ that often comes from the critic’s lack of ‘lived experience’. Again this is something inherited from wider existentialism and not particular to the LGBT ideology only.

Primacy of a **romantic/erotic view of love and of marriage**- love becomes primarily affective and profoundly erotic. This view of desirous love becomes supreme and unquestionable; ‘love means love’. Marriage becomes something done ‘for love’ (as long as it lasts) between two individuals, whereas previously marriage had a large focus on offspring, permanence, and in the two becoming one. The current LGBT position as set out in law also has tensions with the polygamous position. This too is not really an LGBT-specific phenomenon as it also had a gathering momentum in wider culture outside of the LGBT movement, but is an important part of the ideology.

I’d say that theologically speaking, Christianity and Judaism have much more in common than Judaism and Islam.

2833,"Are you for real? A generation is considered to be 20-30 years. Therefore If a young adult that grew up in the interwar period was 20 by 1939. Then in 2020 we have a subsequence of four generations or three generations (by conservative estimates) in 2020. So according to you, fourth generation Poles feel they are ""not on their land"" while Polish immigrants feel like they own London or Malmo after only 3 months after immigrating? Not to mention we live in a reality of free movement of people (pre-Covid) and it is common to change cities, countries, citizenship. It's a reality, it's a the milieu, it's the zeitgeist. 

You are overstating family influences, which I am also skeptical of your anecdotal evidence (acquaintance of your wife, come on, at least show a survey or something credible). I mean you even ignore the fact that Poles in North Western Poland are less traditional and less attached to their families than Central and Eastern Poles. Using Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory model, an individual interacts at five levels. The family is included in the microsystem which is only one of the levels but does not constitute the entire level. Just to be brief, an individual is affected by institutions, culture (national and international), values,  milieu, time, peers, family, media etc on five different levels. Unless you're a momma's boy with an uncut umbilical cord, there will always be differences between generations. It's astonishing that I am explaining this to you since there was a recent election with different world-views and values between younger and older generations. 

But yeah sure, Gen-Z is not interested in updating their Tik-Tok, acing their matura, getting into their preferred university, listening to Taco Hemingway, travelling, getting a good job, partying in the tri-cities, music, sports ... all they are doing is thinking via grand-Babcia that they allegedly do own their land since it rightfully belongs to the Kaiser.

If it indulges in rhetoric that it cannot back up with action, the EU will only play into Lukashenka’s and Moscow’s hands – feeding its paranoia and helping it portray the protests as a form of Western hybrid interference.

However, too soft a line will only encourage more assertive Russian behaviour, in not just Belarus but also other post-Soviet states. If European and US diplomats shrug off Russia’s deployment of media cadres and declared readiness to send Russian security personnel to Belarus, Moscow could be increasingly tempted to test the limits of international acceptance of Russian interference in other post-Soviet countries as well. That is why, sooner or later, the EU will face the issue of whether to impose sanctions on not just Belarusian policymakers but also some of the Russians involved in the autocratic crackdown in Belarus, starting with Russian operatives on Belarusian TV.

Belarus provides a useful reminder that there is no illiberal or conservative anti-democratic tide to the east of the EU. Quite the contrary. In the last two and a half years, Armenia and Belarus have gone through large-scale street protests driven by a desire for greater democracy, and voters in Ukraine and Moldova have voted against oligarchic rulers.

I dont think anybody considers them sheep, but seeing as they have lost much of their claws through the unity of ZBCG and with the near certain collapse of the DPS, they lose their only appeal as much of their policy making was based on campaigns against the DPS.  


&gt; Albanian representatives around Dritan will send those fascists back to opposition as soon as they try to do something fishy. 

This line of reasoning really annoys me sometimes. Dritan has been bullied, insulted and dicriminated against by the now former government. He has been presented as an enemy of the state and a traitor throughout the whole DPS campaign. And now, that he can finally be the king-maker, he should break the deal he made with the opposition and bring back an autocrat who prosecuted him for years. The Albanian parties have been with the DPS the entire time and never said anything in defence of Dritan. And now he is supposed to listen to them? Why? Why bring back an autocracy that has lost an election and has been in power of 30 years and break your promise to your fellow coailition members?  


While I don't like the DF as much as the next man, their power has been severly cut up by this victory in the elections mostly due to Krivokapic who seems to be pushing hard for moderate reformation of policies inside the coalition and who has siedlined radicals in the party.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/11/geography-survey-illiteracy/

What you see is a war between right-wing &amp; left-wing NGOs in Poland. A culture war. 

First, there is no such thing as LGBT free zones. There are certain towns that introduced a card in support of traditional family values pushed by far-right Catholic NGO. 

This was cynically used by the left-wing to tag it as LGBT free zones. Simply slapping a tag, taking pictures, and blowing it up online. Good strategy but manipulating nevertheless. That atlas of hate was a controversial move from the Left but to be honest it only backfired. The same with constant desecration of Catholic symbolism and unnecessary violence on the streets.

At least Poland is actually going through the much-needed debate about LGBT rights. It's better than just being silent and hiding all the bad.

&gt; Unless the batteries cost drop by 90 %, they will still be more expensive than tradtitional cars.

Source on the 90% number? Volkswagen appears to purchase batteries for around $100/kWh. A compact EV needs maybe a 55 kWh battery, which implies costs of around €5.000 for the battery. 

Electric motors aren't particularly expensive, they and the power electronics should not cost more than a few additional thousand Euro. Coupled to assembly in a low cost country (or on a heavily automated production line) with the appropriate volume we could see prices around 20k € within the next few years. 

With subsidies that's within the reach of many people. Don't forget the operating costs are lower as well.

&gt;This will not make electric cars cheaper but all other cars more expensive. Yay, no more cars for poor people. Glabal warming is solved.

Complete bullshit. It forces manufacturers to **sell** EVs, meaning they need to reduce the prices.

&gt;No it doesn't since you have to swap the battery for a new one every few years and it is extremelly expensive.

3019,"The point is that you are factually incorrect, just as you are right now in literally every one of your statements. As I said, I should know because I made it many many times.

Foods like these are part of ""zimnica"", which are foods made to last through the winter when you can't grow vegetables. It's like you said ""Kulen"" was made to maximize income, which is completely incorrect, it was invented to preserve the meat, and only much later became a ""delicacy"". And didn't I just say that in rural areas, every single family had their own vegetable garden where they grew potatoes, paprikas or sweet peppers as you said, eggplants, onions and literally whatever comes to mind. So no, the ""Ajvar"" or any variation of it wasn't made as an expensive product, since why would it be expensive if every single family in the rural area can make it themselves. Macedonia is well known for their peppers and special sorts of them, but it's far from unreachable for anyone in Balkans area.

Then on to the cooking time. Again what you say is factually incorrect, since the one who decides the cooking time are the people who make it. So if me and my grandma like ""Ajvar"" with chunks in it, we are going to cook it less regardless if my sister likes it smoother, or vice versa. Also, if my wife can't eat spicy food, I can decide to not put any hot peppers in it.

3046,"&gt; In the meantime going out of Nuclear and Coal requires much higher natural gas to equalize the lacking reliability from Renewables. 

But that is just the thing, we simply don't have the ships. I did a calculation 5 years ago or so, because NS2 goes way back and so does the anti-NS2 movement.

Under the assumptions that all LNG ships are currently the largest vessels that were ever build, we could just barely supply Europe. But 80% of those ships work to supply the Asian countries and obviously not all ships are the largest we ever build. Nevermind that i didn't even include the time to load/unload the LNG nor possible maintenance.

We are maybe at 10% of the required numbers. Think how long it will take and how much it would cost to have the numbers needed.

And all that money is for what? To replace one supplier with another? That is money invested into fossil based things that we could throw at renewable energy.

And if we never get the storage tech, which i think we will get, then the only alternative is to go nuclear (fission or fusion, depending what is available) Renewable energy in this way is good because the lifetime of the plants isn't that long.

3123,"&gt; Another thing he did was removing the American troops in Kurdistan, paving the way for Turkey's invasion and genocide of EU+US allied Kurds.

So he at least partially did what he promised in campaign and criticized Obama pretty outspokenly for - he decreased US presence in Syria. What gives USA right to illegally occupy country's territory without ever officially declaring war and attacking government forces and denying them entrance into parts of their own country? They should leave Syria entirely, but Trump's greed has him still occupying Syria's oil fields.

&gt; Another thing he did was one-sidedly cancelling the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with Iran, stirring tensions, and in effect helping the Iranian Nuclear Program.


&gt; The result of Trumps actions is an ongoing war in Syria, an ongoing war in Ukraine, an ongoing conflict on the Arabic peninsula, the deepening of the crisis in Palestine, and the nuclear armament of North Korea, Iran and Russia.

Most of the things you listed are all consequences of actions taken during Obama administration, not something that Trump started. Appeasement of Russia led to war in Ukraine, Syrian civil war largely spiralled out of control thanks to Obama administration training and supplying jihadists with weapons. That's also what enabled ISIS taking so much ground. North Korea would had their nuclear weapons anyway and Trump moves actually de-escalated tensions with them. You also didn't mention Libya or Yemen, you can thank Obama for that too.

Only thing I agree that Trump administration escalated is heavily pushing Israeli interests in Middle East and that's where escalation with Iran and in Palestine comes from.",,/r/europe/comments/itczef/confidence_in_us_president_of_people_in_france/g5gizef/,hack_squat,1600252699

3134,"I get what you're saying and I'm not disagreeing that things look  OK now and Montenegro has a clear path to joining the EU. I certainly hope that happens and I do think it's possible. But I do see the potential for things to deteriorate. I mean things look best right after an election, right? That's the time when parties have made their most ambitious and optimistic promises, when they haven't been bogged down with the difficulty of what they're trying to do or with the bribes they may be offered not to do it.   And in addition to these usual factors you also have Serbian and Russian influence behind the scenes puling away from the EU. Serbia may change its mind if it enters  the EU and wants Montenegro with it but honestly I highly doubt that will happen with Vucic in charge. 

And as the article mentions the biggest coalition  party may open more levers for these two to expand their influence, through the security apparatus, religious ties     and granting citizenship to Serbian voters in Serbia.   


This reminds me a lot of Russian influence in Bulgaria which once in is constantly looking to network and expand.  Integration with the West doesn't stifle it as much as you would expect.  And I notice that overall our parties seem to have gotten more pro-Russian even though the people don't approve of the Russian government as much as in the past and self-identify more with Europe and the West than they used to.    

The good news is that even compromised parties will still work for integration with the West if they have a strong democratic mandate for it. But does Montenegro have that? I've read that although positive your country's desire to join the EU is still the second lowest after Serbia.

3195,"OK, I am not a history genius, so I will try to explain as best as I can. To anyone reading this, if I make mistakes, please correct.

So, Ancient Greece is not technically a country. There were several city-states such as Athens, Sparta, Macedonia, etc. They were considered autonomous bodies and were even often in conflict with each other. However, they shared the same language (ancient Greek) and shared some traditions as well. It was only later that they became a unified nation.

Since Macedonians spoke ancient Greek and the population of FYROM is Slavs, there is no connection besides geographical proximity. The FYROM govt is using this proximity and the fact that for a while in ancient times there was no notion of unity in Greece, as an excuse to usurp Greek history. Ie the argument is ""Macedonians weren't technically Greek because Greece didn't exist back then, therefore since we are near Macedonia, we are Macedonians"".

Stating that in e.g. the Netherlands 85.7% of passenger-km is done by car without considering that roughly \~8.6% of km is traveled by bicycle ([source](https://www.fietsersbond.nl/ons-werk/mobiliteit/fietsen-cijfers/), [source](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84708NED/table?ts=1600272217368)), gives a very wrong idea of travel means within a country.

In my town in Germany, I've seen for example loads of Poles and Romanians, who didn't speak a lick of German (I często wyśmiewali się z Niemców jako głupich nazistów) and were getting drunk every other day and at the same time, I've seen whole Turkish families, who even among themselves spoke often German and lived German lives. 

I certainly wouldn't say that their integration failed and that the integration of people, who came recently is failing, I had a few Syrian colleagues, whose whole families were struggling to live decently, but always tried their best, working as hard as anyone and trying to improve their German at the same time, yes the statistics may not be in their favour and of course, since many of them live in poverty far away from home, without possibility to go back, it will be harder for them and some do turn to crime, but all is not lost. 

I think what the people in the West often see is exactly that, not the ""rape statistics"", but still the individual stories and hardships of people who came there... They at least are more prone to show compassion and understanding to them, unlike most people from our countries in the east of the EU.

1. While the DF is a righting party, their curent leader and other parties in the coalition like the SNP are more centre right. Their far right leaders have decided to compromise and deradicalise their views in order to make this coalition work.
2. The Demokrate are certainly a pro EU pro Western party and they share more vlaues with URA than with the DF.
3. URA is the kingmaker here and they have many choices if they feel that his govenrment is not working out. They could form a minority government with the backing of the DPS and the DF which would be rather interesting.
4. The expert government that is curently negotiated will aim to remove these influences of the different views from policy making and the future govenment will it seems be almost certainly much more invested into getting us into the EU.

However the details need to be worked out still, because of several complicating factors. E.g. different states have different sizes and different already existing qualities of public transport (e.g. the city of Vienna has fantastic transport, where 365€/year is a great deal, while Burgenland has maybe 2 trains a day going into the deep south of the state and 365€ is actually a high price), you have to account for the state boundary-crossing gravitational forces of metropolitan areas (e.g. Vienna is a city and a state, all surrounded by another state, Lower Austria, and really close to northern Burgenland. There's a lot of people driving in and out of Vienna every day and those people need to get a better solution; similar thing with lots of Lower Austrians who work in the Upper Austrian capital Linz).

For better effect, I could have compared to Poland, which Trump likes more than Germany, or to China, just to piss him off.

I however explicitly stated why I chose Germany: It is large, it was not hit early on (like the U.S., ruling out Italy and Spain), it is a federal entity where health is a local issue (like the U.S., ruling out the UK and France), it is Western (like the U.S., ruling out e.g. Japan or Singapore). I think the only other entity that roughly fits this description is Australia, which has even lower deaths per million than Germany.

&gt;are roughly the same as in UK, Italy and Spain

For UK, they have a known notorious liar in the office, just like the U.S., for Italy and Spain, these countries were hit very early when no one knew about possible cures and therefore had overcrowded hospitals, with ordinary flu and Covid taking place at the same time. U.S. and U.K., just like Germany, had ample time to learn from the disasters in Italy and Spain, but their leaders chose not to.

With Belgium, I honestly don't know what they did wrong.

&gt;the Feds can't do much except add funds and such which they did

The federal government, both in Germany and in the U.S., has had huge impact on the local governments and the people, completely apart from funding:

Merkel was on TV, recommending social distancing - and people distanced. Trump was on TV, downplaying the severity of the issue - and people didn't take it seriously.

Merkel supported state PMs who introduced measures to curb the spread, and she encouraged state PMs to meet and discuss measures. Trump publicly ridiculed and threatened state governors who took decisive action, and he discouraged state governors from introducing measures or even discussing them.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/itczef/confidence_in_us_president_of_people_in_france/g5g6y5h/,P0L1Z1STENS0HN,1600239325

3421,"Well, to get to the numbers, we could compare two large federally organized Western countries that have not been hit hard early on, for example Germany and the U.S.

Germany has 1/4th the population of the U.S., so to compare, we can just multiply their numbers by 4. And Germany has their fair share of nutjobs who don't believe in Corona, just not in high government positions. They even have similar outbreaks in meat processing plants. The number of people furloughed in Germany (7mn) is about a quarter of the number of people who applied unemployment in the U.S. (30mn). So, quite similar, *except* for the federal government's crisis response.

So, if the U.S. fared as well as Germany, they would probably have

* 1.1mn cases, not 6.6mn
* 40k deaths, not 200k
* mask mandates and social distancing rules in all states (imposed by the governors, endorsed by the federal government)

Many governors have shown time and time again before the current federal administration that they are able to handle a local crisis or ask for federal assistance if the crisis goes beyond their pay grade. Administration after administration has shown that they are able to assist, to some extent, in disaster recovery. Furthermore, the current administration has already shown during the aftermath of that hurricane in Puerto Rico that they are unable to handle a crisis, that every ""coordinated response"" they try ends in utter chaos.

All these factors together strongly indicate that every death beyond 40k is due to the ineptitude of the federal government to handle the crisis.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/itczef/confidence_in_us_president_of_people_in_france/g5fxtm9/,P0L1Z1STENS0HN,1600231640

3463,"&gt; It's not an ""argument from authority"" in any way.

That's exactly what argument from authority is. It's basically you should trust because he is historian, no you need to give reference to the source to be credible. That's how it's done in human studies. And in general articles in popular media aren't good sources.

&gt; Prove your ""alternative"" point.

What alternative point? I don't have any. We are talking about the authenticity of the quoted letter.

&gt; This first phrase of the article simply doesn't mention nationality. But the table in the right of the article tell that his nationality (citizenship) was Russian empire, UNR, and USA and his ethnicity is Ukrainian (in Ukrainian it is Національність - not to be confused with ""nationality"" in English).

The first phrase is what is taken into account by a map creator. And no the table only is saying that his Громадянство or підданство (citizenship or subjection) was Russian, his nationality (Національність) is clearly stated as Ukrainian. How can you be this dishonest dude?

And Ukrainian Національність is the same as English nationality, see [here](https://slovnyk.ua/index.php?swrd=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C)",Poland,/r/europe/comments/isj8d2/inspired_by_the_igor_sikorsky_thread_what/g5fza0c/,antropod00,1600232721

&gt;Is the EU willing to scrap the whole thing including the divorce bill and all the other provisions such as controlling NI for the purposes of trade because the UK has made a small but not huge change to the agreement

To turn around this argument: Is the UK willing to scrap the whole thing then, in their quest to break the GFA? The current Tory administration is trying to convince others it's small after causing an uproar. You've said it's small, but in the view of the EU, it is a scandal that affects the very foundation of agreements.

No, to parrot this argument is something that I feel is not in good faith. Only in r/europe, British subs don't seem to even entertain the words of Boris Johnson.

&gt;It would not gain anything from it and has a considerable amount to lose, if its no-deal however the UK would benefit from scraping the withdrawal agreement.

As if the UK's current administration needed an excuse, that's the very reason why there's a scandal. Do you believe the UK will benefit from a no-deal? Or be hurt less?

No, the UK is not throwing us a bone to ""only"" do this small amendment, and the way officials are completely unrepentant about this line of action has led some to believe that this is only a start.

To reiterate something I typed earlier:

&gt;Any negotiation isn't worth the paper it's signed on then.  If the UK and the EU signed access to the common market, on the agreement that the UK wouldn't subsidize their industries or drastically cut regulations, what's to say that that agreement won't be torn up?

The UK is gambling that this incident won't affect it's soft power or reputation.",All expressed views are not representative,/r/europe/comments/isklgs/eu_to_delay_euro_clearing_decision_due_to_brexit/g5f7laa/,frissio,1600216794

**Edit:** With some more research, I can say that I am certain that ajvar was not made at home in Croatia ""traditionally"". Sweet bell peppers only exist since the 19th century, so it couldn't have been a traditional recipe anyway.

The first mention of ajvar as a vegetable dip is from a Serbian cookbook from 1877, but  it was made with eggplants, not peppers. The first mentions of what we now know as ajvar are from the very end of the 19th century, when it was sold in a Belgrade restaurant owned by a Macedonian.

Even in the regions that are close to Macedonia and are now famous for their ""traditional"" ajvar (e.g. Leskovac) people started making ajvar only after WWII.

3764,"Well, Lybia was not something like Iraq or Afghanistan. It was protests motivated by the Arab Spring, the Arab League calling for intervention, the UN (including Russia &amp; China) [de facto authorizing an attack](https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/03/369382-security-council-authorizes-all-necessary-measures-protect-civilians-libya), and then a coordinated NATO intervention where [France was the first power to strike](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9ration_Harmattan). I would argue that European powers had an even greater interest in the removal of Al-Qadhafi than the US.

Syria is not that simple as well. If you read into the [leaked Clinton emails](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18328#efmADMAFf), you find that, initially, the main reason for the American support of the Syrian opposition was to ease Irans pressure on Israel to prevent a full-scale war between the two countries. Israel threatened a lot of times to attack Iran if they are on the brink of developing an atomic bomb that could wipe out Tel Aviv and Haifa. One of Israels main concerns is that Iran could pass such a bomb to Hisbollah which is not unrealistic at all. Limiting Irans influence in Syria by helping the opposition to overthrow the government is one thing the US does to prevent Israel from launching a direct attack on Iran which would probably result in a full scale war.

Another aspect to prevent a war between Israel and Iran was the nuclear deal between Iran and the Western powers which Obama negotiated and Trump left without any replacement whatsoever. If Iran has the atomic bomb, Israel will also get it and it is withouth question that Irans arch enemy Saudi Arabia (the nation that [funded and supplied ISIS](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774)) will then get it as well. We will see how Turkey will react to all of this. This is a better example of a gigantic clusterfuck than what I could have ever imagined and it is only a few years or decades away.

So, America, of course, has a right not to engage in any conflicts. But I don't know if the result is a safer world. Sometimes, you fight a small war to prevent a large one. Sometimes, of course, you're also just greedy shithole and invade another country to steal its ressources and to subsidize your war industry, e.g. Iraq.

But I agree with your intention that Obama is not the white knight (pun intended) as whom he was praised in Europe.

3775,"&gt;Don't ask me why that election boosted the Greens that strongly. 

It's because the demographics of the active electorate for EU elections and national elections look quite different. Younger voters generally turn out less reliably than older voters, but the drop off from the average participation between federal elections and EU elections is lower for younger voters than older voters. So let's say 80% of the 65+ age bracket turn out for national elections, while only 65% of the 18-25 age bracket turns out. And for EU elections there's a drop off to 60% for the 65+ age bracket and to 55% for the 18-25 age bracket. Compared to the national average, the Greens now get a considerably better result because their key demographics only dropped off by 10% while their worst demographic dropped off by 20%. 

The other reason is that all groups of foreign or ethnic minorities also have relatively high turnout rates for EU elections and also always favor Greens, Left and SPD.",United Countries of Europe,/r/europe/comments/itehpz/cologne_germany_how_16_to_24_year_olds_voted_in/g5evmet/,OneJobToRuleThemAll,1600210175

You are skipping entire point of negotations by saying something that has nothing to do with the actual deal. You either want border check in ireland or not. Withdrawal agreement was made so that there can be no border on ireland, and if you don't like what was written, signing it up was straight up dumb, and there is no way to spin it in any other way.

If EU needs to come back to planet earth then UK needs to come back to milky way asap because those pieces of paper we call international deals are quite important.

You won't have borderless trading with EU anytime soon and right now you have a border to build in the worst place possible. It's not about EU not allowing Britain to be independent, it's about Britain pretending to be the most important nation on the continent.

Again, the best way to get a better deal was not signing the withdrawal agreement. Breaking it won't give you anything better. I guess good faith is not expected anyway so that going away doesn't matter.

I have no bad intentions and I don't wish anything bad to anybody in UK. But I'm 100% sure I would not sign anything ever again because you are not trustworthy.

*Next, Svoboda prints the text according to US Historian professor Daria Markus (https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2008-11-22-0811210323-story.html).*

OK. I provided you with enough information. Respected old newspaper and Historian professor are enough to trust. But you failed to supplement your words even with this level of proof. So please do that, otherwise, this discussion is pointless. Your opinion about the credibility of those sources is much less convincing than the sources themselves because you don't have anything to base it on.

It's your personal opinion which seems to be biased. Anyway, it's not how Wikipedia works. Each thesis must be supplemented with some source and this article contains enough sources to confirm that he had Ukrainian origin. This would be obvious even without such references because his family lived here for generations, so he would have mainly Ukrainians in his family.

About Vienna -  15 BC the Romans fortified the frontier city they called Vindobona to guard the empire against Germanic tribes to the north.

In 976 Leopold I of Babenberg became count of the Eastern March, a 60-mile district centering on the Danube on the eastern frontier of Bavaria. This initial district grew into the duchy of Austria. 

In 1440 Vienna became the resident city of the Habsburg dynasty.

3947,"&gt;From what I know for both refugees and migrants are legal ways to get to Europe 

Yeah but that is not the issue. The issue is that most people actually do come here legally, at least those that can actually stay. Maybe you live in one of those countries that found the refugee crisis too good to pass up on to achieve cheap political points by playing with the darkest instinct of people and make them afraid, but even during the migrants crisis the plan was along along to get these people home once the countries were safe again and simp,y send home  all purely economic migrants. And exactly that is done. 

So no, this debate is not about ""illegal"" migrants, that is just smoke and mirrors. It is about migrants, period. 

&gt; Piercing pontoons before shore so none can turn them back is not forcing a stay 

No. Because staying is actually getting alowance for residency, permit to work, all the bells and whistels. Only then are you also capable to recieve state aid in case of unemployment.

4070,"I'm not completely sure what you mean by that so if you can clarify?

History always applies. Greeks and Turks dislike eachother. A greek calling a Turk something or a Turk calling a Greek something should always be considered with their history in mind, which is not a pleasant history.

The Turkish empire was stronger, and defeated and conquered the greeks, and created an enviroment in which these people grew up with a big hatred for the opressing side.

I don't think it's an unrealistic thing to consider that for Greeks (And other balkan nations) that part of history (The Ottoman empire conquering them and making them puppets or subjects) is comparable to the big 'slave trade' controversy for people in the US.

As a result, the Greek nation, from the moment of its creation has been living in the fear of their history, and their unwillingness to ever let it happen again. By now, we are living in the 21st century. Most countries have histories like this and in many cases we've let history be history and try to look towards the future, yet there are still nations with similar situations. (Poland &amp; Russia come to mind as an example, as does Finland).

These nations often have a disproportionate amount of firepower compared to other nations with similar sizes, and are always prepared for any form of action towards them from these nations.

Turkey and Russia are both perfect examples of how not to fix these relations. Instead of growing closer and cooperating with Greece, current Turkey (And Russia is somewhat similar as I said before for Poland) is doing the complete opposite, and has been doing this a long time. Even before Erdohan relations between Greece and Turkey have not been strong.

My point with all of this, is in these situations, the positive change HAS to come from the 'bigger and stronger' nation first. Turkey and Greece will never have good relations unless TURKEY actively undertakes the steps to make it happen.

This is even ignoring that the greeks have shown themselves to be a better democracy then Turkey towards the democratic world, but also because the greek position is much more vulnerable.

Nowadays we have NATO and the EU, so this entire situation is no longer exactly the same, and calling Turkey the 'stronger' nation while Greece is EU backed is not completely fair, but remember that the current situation has been formed with easily more then 800 years of history.

Not looking at the complete picture in order to understand the current situation is simply not fair.

That's right, it's where they think UK GDP will be in 20 years under a no-deal scenario, vs where they think it will be in 20 years under a baseline (FTA) scenario. Predicting GDP two decades ahead is largely pointless - these forecasts are *never* right, it's difficult enough trying to estimate output 2 years out...
- So, what GS are comparing here is the cost of covid over a 3 year period vs their estimate for the cumulative loss of growth in 20 years under a no-deal scenario.

""NATO"", ""EU"" are yet another facades of the West. It's known who supplied Saddam: it was [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_chemical_weapons_program#Early_history:_the_1970s).

My point is that the West has a terrible track record of interventions in other countries' affairs and making, in fact, things worse. Despite its delusions of grandeur, the West has repeatedly made the world a worse place than it used to be. Another problem is that the West lacks self reflection and therefor is unable to evaluate the results of its actions. At best, the West thinks that it makes ""mistakes"" every now and then.

For example, most people would not want to pay taxes if they could get away with it (look at any country which doesn't enforce tax collection in strict way) but the consequences of not doing so can be dire. We can choose to make rehabilitation a part of our justice system but making it the center piece of the justice system against all odds is not some great evolved way to go.

4226,"Turkey's do not punish anyone. Europe punish herself enough already.   
It was opened 6 months ago just as a word. 100 thousand people went to the borders, compared to 6 million people, this is nothing.    
Nobody can protect their borders enough, especially in such a world order. At least we took the people in need and then complained, we did not leave them in the middle of the war.  And the reason for going into this war is an issue that needs to be discussed separately. There are just and unjust reasons, but we did not directly participate in this war until 2016.  hundreds of our people died in ISIS and PKK terrorist attacks.  The Europeans really think you can punish Turkey a helpless situation.  Authoritarian leaders are forming in mythicalist and nationalist countries like ours because of people in your mindset.  Let's blow what we don't like and let everyone be like us.    
The wealth of 3-4 countries in Europe (everyone knows whose blood is based on that wealth) does not concern us. We say leave us alone, but this country will not be the gatekeeper of Europe.  You threaten Turkey with sanctions.    
But as soon as you make these threats, the Turkish people say, let them come, we will eat stones, yet we will not bow to them.    
But it doesn't work. People suffer. But then other countries benefit from this business. While Europe is so divided within itself, Europe must learn to behave properly to its friends in such a filthy geography.    
Turkey, Russia and China even closer every day.    
It's getting more authoritarian. Freedoms are restricted. One of the culprits of this is Europe.  At the end of this course, not only we, but all of us will suffer. There is a government in the Eastern Mediterranean that has taken the risk to fight with Greece.

It's Johnsons deal (and yes, the deal he's breaking is a deal he wrote) was so important.

More to the actual point, it depends. The repercussions might be non existant or severe. This is like asking what would happen if the US decided to nuke Madagaskar. Everything from starting WW3 to strongly worded condemnations is on the table.

Maybe countries stop making deals with the UK, back out of existing deals or decide that they are no longer bound to obligations they had with the UK (this is mostly the EU but opportunists might jump on this)

Maybe everyone just rolls their eyes and everything just keeps on moving because everybody is just pretending to take international law, agreements and rules in general seriously.

The ball is really in the EU's court. If the people who cried the EU was punishing the UK were even remotely right, now the EU is justified in breaking any and all ties. After all, if an agreement isn't worth anything, why bother talking. If the other side is telling you cooperation is impossible, why try and cooperate.

If we should allow the state murdering murderers because the victim's family feels like it, it's just revenge killing with extra steps. Law has to be impartial to both the offended and the offender.

&gt; The initial deal (made after Fall of France) was that we Poles will pay for our forces, out of the Polish gold reserves evacuated to (eventually) Canada. The story of that evacuation could make a suspenseful movie, by the way, but that for another time. You have to remember that those were the times of gold standard for currencies, that amount of gold was considerable and would actually cover that cost, as the end-of-the-war accounting showed.

&gt; Still, after WWII the British Government made a decision to write off that debt. This was not a small thing, the UK was essentially bankrupt after WWII, AFAIK rationing in the UK was going on for years after WWII and people lived among a general scarcity. AFAIK the UK had paid off the WWII era debts only in 21st century. Wars are that expensive.

&gt; The decision by the British Government to write off that Polish debt could have something to do with the fact that Poland remained pretty much under the occupation, the Soviet one this time.

&gt; There was one thing the Polish government in exile had to cover - costs of the support for Polish civilians/refugees accepted into UK and Dominions, those who did not enlist (like children etc).

4302,"Yep.

Microsoft's Azure has had essentially a blank check with one mandate: beat Amazon. 5 or so years since that plan started, they're not even close. (though I do not think they are falling behind, they're also not catching up.)

Having essentially limitless capital is not sufficient to be a serious contendor in that space, but it *is* required.

AWS is the benchmark, and they move *incredibly* fast. Moving that fast requires money. A lot of money. Anyone with less than 4-5 years worth of AWS's total operating budget (call it 40 billion USD) in the bank should genuinely not even try to compete with AWS.

The problem (or one of them, anyway) is that AWS has refined the shit out of their basic building blocks, and people have come to expect that. A new offering with an object store that is slower and less reliable than S3 just gets put straight in the trash, but building something comparable to S3 is a many-years-long project that requires a huge amount of practical experience that is basically silo'd inside the top 5 or so companies. They have a huge amount of privilege from being first-movers, because they learned all of the hard lessons while nobody else had learned them yet, and so users were tolerant of those failures.

One option for new entrants is to target some niche, like DigitalOcean has done with developer workloads. But they should understand that they're not going to build up a war chest and eventually outgrow that niche. There's no world in which DigitalOcean, a reasonably successful and competent company, ever becomes a global contendor on par with AWS, Azure, and GCP.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/ist4jv/frances_macron_says_europe_has_lost_the_global/g5cmeoz/,SeasonActual,1600174275

This treaty makes any territorial claims null and void and that’s why Armenian politicians always try to walk around.

You really need to stop with this bs propaganda. Genocide term invented by a Polish guy in 40s to describe the treatment of Jews under Nazis. 

In 1918 Armenian leaders were actually thanking Ottoman Empire, declaring that their independent nation is all due to the goodwill of Ottoman Empire. And guess who was present? Talat pasha.
Another genocide guy Halil Pasha actually visitied Armenia as a guest of your then Prime Minister.

These two guys are tried in Turkish courts by the Ankara government led by Mustafa Kemal and exiled from Turkey. So, no! The term genocide wasn’t invented yet and there were no demands from Armenia side.

You are really ignorant on this matter and I think you really should read and learn.

Stop generalizing? Dude you called every Turk a sheep couple of comments ago. I didn’t say every Armenian supports asala but there is a Asala memorial in Armenia. Actually pretty recently another asala terrorist died and what did Armenians do? Held a memorial there.

Moshe replied, 'I used to read the Jewish newspapers, but what did I find? Jews being persecuted, Israel being attacked, Jews disappearing through assimilation and intermarriage, Jews living in poverty... I got so depressed!

So I switched to the Arab newspaper. Now what do I find? Jews own all the banks, Jews control the media, Jews are all rich and powerful, Jews rule the world. The news is so much better!'

I would put borderline in difference between tolerance and promotion. For example look at immigration crisis - We understand that those people comes from poverty and places that noone want to be, but we also understand that is their job to change it and we don't have any obligations to help them. Most of Poles are actually happy that we have now country that is attractive for others but we won't promote culture of those migrants as something that represents higher value than our own. We have no problem when foreigners comes here to work for themselves as we done this for many years, but we won't accept when they hunt only social benefits and their presence is just a burden for rest of us. In terms of religion - Catholicism held us together in darkest times during our history, on the other hand we all see how devastating can be Islam so putting them in the same basket it's also crossing the line, and that's the narrative in west. In terms of nationalism we have our first 30 years of freedom form more than two centuries of being dependent from neighbors in different extend. People see how the country is changing and are just proud of that, we don't want to be meme or bastard of Europe anymore and west call as Nazis because we waving out flags on national day. And there is LGBT movement that in eyes of many is not focused to bring equality but rather to make them someone special. Like last case when some guy who pretends to be a women beat some guy from anti-abortion organization (it's on footage) and then flew from police and did not respond to calls from
Public prosecutions. When police located him to bring him to the hearing LGBT movement made a  cordon and protect him as a some hero. What is even worst this guy is a mockery to all of them as he have relationship with two girls (still calling himself a women). One of them is a lesbian so they have lesbian relationship and the other girl call herself a man so as he ""is"" a woman is perfectly fine. Hard to call it an equality when they protect unworthy people just because they think it's one of theirs. Last thing is rising cancel culture and lack of ability for liberals to discuss - ""you are with us or against us"" and if you even voice concerns you will be ostracized as a bigot, xenophobe, racist, Nazi, islamophobe and so on.

Here is a tip: Lower taxes and regulations and suprise suprise your tech sector will be growing like hot buns in oven. And not just tech sector but everything.

No sane tech expert will go to europe to pay 60-80% of his money in taxes and combat few books of idiotic regulations. Especially when all of their work is via remote. Why not to go to low tax nation and just live there ? 

ARM being bought by Nvidia is just icing on cake of idiotism in Europe. Soon Europe will be only about farming at this rate and at some point people will realize that ""regional"" products protection means some low quality trash as world moves on with technology and improve their products.

4590,"I think Turkey is a Eurasian country. Neither European, nor Asian. But what you say doesn't make sense.

&gt; they follow a middle eastern religion

Europeans have been following a Middle Eastern religion. Why? Because Jesus Christ was from the Middle East. He was a semitic dude who most probably looked like Arabs.

If you're talking about Islam, there are Muslim-majority countries in European continent: Albania, Kosovo, Bosnia. There are countries with large Muslim population (1/3 of Macedonians, 1/4 of Cypriots, 1/5 of Montenegrins). There are Muslim majority federal states within Russia: Cherkessia, Tataristan, Ingushetia etc.

&gt; they’re mostly ethnically MI (way more in the eastern parts ofc)

Vast majority of modern-day Turks are descendants of ancient Anatolians. Based on genetical data, the closest country to Turkey is Greece (the second most similar area is Western Iran, because of Kurdish majority area in Turkey).

&gt; way more in the eastern parts ofc

Yeah, southeastern part of Turkey (1/4 of Turkey) is basically an area of Kurdish majority and Arab majority cities. Most of Kurds/Arabs have a darker skin-tone. Similar to Portugal and Southern Spain in which lots of people look like Maghrebi Arabs.

&gt; they speak an eastern language

What does *eastern language* mean? Indian and Persian languages are members of Indo-European language family. Indo-European languages (like Germanic, Slavic, Romance, Iranian and Indian languages) are neither western, nor eastern.

There are European nations that speak Uralic languages: Finland, Estonia and Hungary. Persian and English are sister languages and none of them is comparable to Uralic languages.

Maltese language is a Semitic language just like Hebrew and Arabic.

So what's going on? If you don't like reading about history and linguistics, you may get confused. I'm gonna try to explain it by using sociology.

The thing is, nations believe in national myths. Nations are [imagined communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community). Most of European countries stopped fighting with each other couple of decades ago. And they're trying to forge a *European identity*. But you can't do that based on genetics (there's no genetical isolation) or language (there's no linguistic isolation) or religion (Europe is a multi-cultural continent). So you're trying to do that based on a fantasy. Average human-being (including average European) is extremely ignorant. So it's easy for average European to believe in a fantasy. When a person becomes a part of a group (like a nation), she/he irrationally includes and excludes other people. Parts of a group share a similar sentiment towards different parts of the said group. That's why average Turk/Chinese/German/etc thinks that other Turks/Chinese/Germans/etc are her/his family. An individual believes in a fantasy and thinks that people she/he hasn't seen in her/his life are members of her/his family because of the *imagined community* phenomenon.

&gt; 97% of their country is in Asia

Yeah, that's why I think Turkey is a transcontinental, Eurasian country, located on a peninsula that connetcs Europe and Asia. Geography is a nice instrument to define Europe. Way better than your non-scientific arguments about Middle-Eastern religions (both Christianity and Islam are Middle-Eastern) and Eastern languages (Indo-European languages are neither western, nor eastern).

But if you define Europe by using geography, then Cypriots are not Europeans. So yeah, it's tricky.

4608,"&gt; Fair enough. One other note -- you're giving salaries for France as a whole, whereas ""Silicon Valley"" also isn't representative of the US as a whole -- it is known for high software engineering salaries. So if that's an average that you're using, it's probably more-comparable to choose the area in France that has the highest salaries in software engineering.

France as a whole has MUCH lower salaries than America as a whole, and much higher taxes. The more competitive the field the larger the gap. It's not just tech. Biglaw in America also pay first year associates close to 200k now (including bonus), that's about 130k after tax. In Paris biglaw first year associates earn about 3500/month after tax, and that's after 1.5 years of internship. Same in London. You will find some firms that pay ""qualified"" associates &gt;100k GBP but ""qualified"" 1st year in the UK = 4th/5th year after securing a contract. And Paris and London are not cheaper.

And salaries like these are not exclusive to Silicon Valley. Seattle and NYC both have incredible tech scene that pays highly competitive salaries. Texas is also booming. You won't find even one city in Europe that can afford to pay their employees nearly as much.

But I think saying that expecting near $200K starting salary in Silicon Valley across-the-board isn't realistic.

https://www.wired.com/story/who-pays-the-most-and-least-in-silicon-valley/

That's median pay of software engineers of all experience -- not starting pay -- from a 2018 article.

&gt;Nationally, the average pay for software developers and programmers is $102,470, according to the US Labor Department. Bay Area tech firms are paying considerably more: The median pay at Workday, which makes software that helps businesses manage finances and people, is $178,903, according to its proxy statement.

EDIT: If you want a really high US salary, I believe that neurosurgeons are at or near the top.  Though they come with a lot of caveats that software engineers don't -- you have to spend a lot of time in medical school and residency and so forth, gotta pay for that, and I dunno how interstate medical licensing works so I dunno how mobile you are.  It's not just ""graduate from school, go draw neurosurgeon salary"".

The new centralized healthcare system is built on Microsoft azure, even if it is already known that some data will be transferred to the US. People have warned about it, tried to fight to keep it all in France and in a non American company / state owned data center, to ensure that the US government would not have access to the data. What did the government do about it ? Nothing, they don’t care about it. The new system has to be built as fast as possible, and as cheap as possible, so azure is the solution. That’s just another prime example that the state ruled by the government doesn’t care about French industry, they talk big about sovereignty but don’t do nothing about it.

In France we have OVH, one of the largest cloud in Europe. Instead of using that company to build a solution, in a partnership that would create jobs, enforce sovereignty and increase r&amp;d in the sector in Europe we won’t use public spending on that company just to show that we’re not nationalist, that we embrace globalization.

Last time I was looking, I believe that Facebook was generally-known for paying more in salary, less in options, so they'd probably be at the higher end of the salary range.

Glassdoor.com says that [Facebook's average total pay in Silicon Valley for a software engineer with 0-1 years of experience is $159K/year](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Facebook-Software-Engineer-San-Francisco-Salaries-EJI_IE40772.0,8_KO9,26_IL.27,40_IM759.htm?experienceLevel=LESS_THAN_ONE).

EDIT: Note that Glassdoor doesn't have enough data to show salaries for France, but it does have one entry -- experience not specified -- at [€105K - €113K](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Facebook-Software-Engineer-Germany-Salaries-EJI_IE40772.0,8_KO9,26_IL.27,34_IN96.htm) in Germany.  Converted to USD, that'd be $122K-$135K per year, which is lower than their Silicon Valley wages but also considerably more than 49K EUR/year.  Mind, I've no idea whether the typical French software company pays that or whether it's just Facebook, and Macron was clearly not wanting to be using US multinationals.  However, I'd assume that Facebook isn't going to be paying something *radically* divergent from market rates for someone with that skillset in the area.

EDIT2: My guess is that that's probably not representative, as it had little data.  Facebook Ireland has high confidence and has an average pay, experience not specified, [of €63K/year](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Facebook-Software-Engineer-Ireland-Salaries-EJI_IE40772.0,8_KO9,26_IL.27,34_IN70.htm), or $75K/year.

Second, the US middle class grew less than Denmark's, but was much richer than Denmark to begin with, even per your own data. If one is middle class, it seems they're more likely to become rich in the US, than in the EU. The US middle class is smaller, but on average much richer than any European country with the sole exception of Luxembourg.

Impossible in most of Europe unless I spoke the local language. I already make more than the average European. Of course, my experience is anecdotal.

The question is, how ambitious is someone? I suspect a student willing to come study in the US is far more ambitious than one who isn't. Also such a student likely to be richer than one that doesn't visit. So many variables to take into account 

What is ""rich"" is as relative as ""what is middle class"", but you had no issue above using objective data there. Economists have solved those definitions for us.

I'd believe that, but...I think that with geographical indicators, what matters is the *existing* value of the brand.

So, if you want to create a new brand for something that doesn't yet have much recognition, I'd think that it's easy enough to just register a trademark and then build brand recognition.  As far as I know, any country in the world is fine with creating such a thing.  The US has trademarks owned by governments like ""California Raisins"", ""Idaho Potatoes"", and ""Florida Oranges"" and takes no issue with those the way it does GIs -- there's no need for trade negotiations to create such a thing.

Now, maybe there's something subtle that I'm missing.  Like, okay, maybe ""Panjin rice"" has brand value in the Chinese market *and* for whatever reason they can't get a trademark in the EU (multiple companies from elsewhere already providing something called ""Panjin rice""?) *and* the idea is that they feel that there's value to having the same brand in China and in the EU (like, Chinese expats or something looking on EU store shelves, maybe).

But my -- admittedly non-expert -- understanding that the rationale behind the EU creating geographic indicators was that the brand built value in an era when there was no international trademark regime or convention of doing so.  What GIs can do that trademarks cannot is acquire ownership of a term that may already be used by many in a market.

So for GIs to be important, for there to be a reason to use them instead of the already-existing trademark mechanism, it seems to me that there needs to really already be a brand with established value.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/isncrv/eu_and_china_sign_food_protection_deal_the_two/g5b7m0n/,duisThias,1600133114

2. US education costs money. That increases the motivation (and STRESS) of repayment of student loans. Students are less likely to study something that has little market value. 
3. The rankings you make fun of attract the world's best students. They come to the US, and if they're worth hiring, often will be hired by a US company willing to sponsor their green card. The US uses its universities to steal your brightest students routinely. 
4. We teach in English, which allows us to cater to a wider audience and hire from a larger pool of professors.

No, there are real constraints on load following for nuclear plants (like Beryllium poisoning), which limits their load following in speed, frequency, duration etc.

5023,"Yes exactly

 Since March 2014, the EU has progressively imposed restrictive measures against Russia. The measures were adopted in response to the **illegal annexation of Crimea** and the deliberate **destabilisation of Ukraine**.  

Thats why Putin isnt going to do this officially because that would mean he cant destabalize the theater for a prelonged time, like he did in Ukraine.

Do you know how long it toke for the EU or any other organisation to actually realize what was happening? 

It actually toke quite some time, if I recall correctly it was right about after the unaffiliated Russian military ( AKA little green men) shot down a civilian airplane that had nothing to do with the confict.

5147,"&gt; That is one reason I do not get the hate for all these people trying.

I can think of many reasons why people could have negative feelings about irregular economic migration. Just from the top of my head:

Some people can fear the incoming people have vastly different cultural values which will make integration difficult.

Some people can fear that they will have to compete with the said immigrants for the same jobs.

Some people can fear that the said migrants won't be able to get any jobs (especially when they come illegally, have no valid claim to asylum and hence won't be getting a work permit) - people without the ability to make money through legal job can resort to criminal activity - especially young men.

Some people can fear that even if the said migrants try their hardest to fit in and be productive members of the society, the society will still not accept them and hence integration will be difficult.

Some people can fear that the migrants will be a burden on the welfare system of the country, hence leaving fewer resources for the natives.

Some people can fear it will set a bad precedent. That once you open the door once and let people know that you will allow them to come irregularely, without following the legal routes, more and more people will attempt to do the same. They'd be more open if they had a guarantee that only a certain amount, magable amount (and of course different people will have different ideas about what is managable) will be allowed to enter, but they don't believe this will be the case.

I personally agree with you that it's very understandable that people try to fight for better lives, but for some of the reasons above, I don't believe we should allow every single individual who shows an interest to fullfill this aspiration in our country, to do so.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/isini8/lithuania_refuses_to_accept_refugees_from_greece/g59kcd1/,kristynaZ,1600109010

-Greek population in 1920, 5.5 million
-Turkish population in 1920, 13 million.

5321,"Opting out of European Convention on Human Rights is “for the birds”, the Justice Secretary has insisted, amid suggestions that the Government is planning to curb the influence of its laws.

Robert Buckland said that leaving the convention would be ""wholly wrong"" and claimed that ministers should focus on streamlining domestic laws instead.

It comes after The Telegraph reported that Boris Johnson is preparing to withdraw from major parts of European human rights laws in order to ease migrant deportation cases.

However, Mr Buckland said the laws were a “badge of honour” for the UK and underlined ""fundamental rights"".

He told Times Radio: ""You know, it was British Conservative lawyers who wrote the damn thing back in 1950. We wrote it because we were leaders of Europe when it came to freedom, we wanted to underline the importance of fundamental rights and freedoms back then and that frankly for me is hugely important.

""And I do think that rather than focusing on the European Convention we should be focusing on our own domestic laws and working out where perhaps we've gold-plated laws a bit too much in what is often an English Law tradition, rather than criticising the convention itself.”

The Prime Minister’s aides and ministers are reportedly drawing up proposals to severely curb the use of human rights laws in areas in which judges have ""overreached"".

The plans are understood to include opt-outs from the Human Rights Act, which could prevent many migrants and asylum seekers from using the legislation to avoid deportation and protect British soldiers against claims relating to overseas operations.

Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister's most senior adviser, previously attacked the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for its judgments blocking the deportation of ""dangerous"" foreign criminals.

Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the Government should be focusing on beating coronavirus rather than “giving unattributed briefings designed to distract”.

He said: ""Any attempt to abandon human rights would make life in Britain less secure and hold our country back on the world stage.""

While Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson Wera Hobhouse said the Government's ""attacks on the rule of law must stop"".

""The Human Rights Act does not stop us deporting serious criminals,"" she said.

""Threatening to weaken people's ability to challenge the government just because the courts sometimes rule against you is the act of dictators and despots, not democrats.

""With these plans, Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are trying to enable the Government to run roughshod over people's rights and allow ministers to break the law with impunity.""

The ECHR, and its European Court of Human Rights, are part of a completely different legal system to the EU.

The landmark treaty was devised in the wake of the Second World War and is part of the Council of Europe, which has 47 member states including Russia and the UK.

The Conservatives' 2019 election manifesto promised a review of the Human Rights Act, saying: ""We will update the Human Rights Act and administrative law to ensure that there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government.""",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ism2sr/withdrawing_from_human_rights_convention_is/g58fuvk/,PTRJK,1600094271

President George W Bush made it illegal:

https://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/05/16/us.nireland/index.html

&gt;U.S. outlaws Real IRA

&gt;May 16, 2001

&gt;As a result of the designation, many activities, including fundraising, of the Real IRA or its two so-called ""front groups"" or ""political pressure groups"" -- the ""32 County Sovereignty Movement"" and the ""Irish Republican Prisoner Welfare Association"" -- will be illegal.

&gt;The move freezes the group's U.S. assets, making it unlawful to provide funds or other material support to the Real IRA, while representatives and certain members could be denied visas or excluded from the U.S.

&gt;A senior State Department official says this is the first time a group with ""heavy ties"" to the U.S. -- with ""sympathisers and supporters"" coming from the U.S. -- has been designated as a terrorist organisation. But the ""British and Irish government publicly asked us to look into this."" 

At that point Sinn Fein had already broken the GFA. But when the Americans outlawed the IRA and Real IRA their funding dried up and they came back to the table.

No rich American in the post 9/11 world wants to be prosecuted by their own government for funding terrorists.

5444,"&gt;Thanks to recent reforms, migrants without a Shanghai hukou can now enroll children in public primary and middle schools, but admission to academic high schools is severely restricted.  In addition, students can only sit for the gaokao, the national college entrance exam, in the province of hukou registration.  As a consequence, tens of thousands of families send their children back to rural villages as the children approach high school age.[ii] 

[Lessons from the PISA-Shanghai Controversy](https://www.brookings.edu/research/lessons-from-the-pisa-shanghai-controversy/)

&gt;The results show that, likely in relation to hukou barriers in school admission, migrant students sampled in PISA-Shanghai 2009 were substantially positively selected in terms of family background, leading to an upwardly biased test performance. Though increasing numbers of low-SES migrant children were enrolled in local schools by 2012 due to a series of educational reforms aiming to offer equal access to school opportunities for non-local hukou holders, this progress was only limited to junior high school.
