19,"&gt; Ah yeah, Poland is too nasty to you, while you have been nothing but an  angel to them, no matter that NS2 predates everything you mentioned.  

Yeah, phrases like that will totally make us reconsider. 

&gt;  Germany pushed for this project way before the current Polish government was in power.  

And it never was a problem until it was supposed to go through the Baltic sea. 

&gt; What was your excuse back then?

Excuse? Why the fuck should germany excuse itself for an decades old economic project? The fuck? What kind of entitelment attitude is that? 

&gt; I don't agree with everything Poland does, but the reality is that you never had our backs against Russia 

As if the Czech Republic has anything to fear from Russia these days. There is a realsitic threat assessment...and then their is parania. If you were from the Balitcs, ok. But the Czech Republic? Seriously. 

&gt; You are not a hostile country to us, we have good economic partnership,  but if it was up to you, we would have never been in NATO, because you  would not have the guts to stand up to Russia over us. 

And yet Germany supported EE both in getting into the EU and NATO. So much for reality vs. your scenarious. 

&gt; You are constantly showing this attitude to us, people like you even put  the blame on countries like Ukraine or Poland that they have issues  with Russia, instead of you know, actually put the blame on the actor  who really does live in the 19th century and thinks it has a right to a  sphere of influence. 

What attitude? Not playing firefighters for other countries? Are you denying that Ukraine, whatever their problems with Russia are, fucked with German gas supplies and brought people here into trouble? 

And in general towards EE, you want Germany to help countries that have shown to be outright anti German? Who run huge anit German media campaigns? Or in the case of Poland threatend to confiscate German propperty as some kind of WW2 reperation? Or how EE cared shit about southern Europe during the migrant crisis and then even ""blamed"" Germany for helping out?

I seriously wonder how in the world you think that pissing of people, giving shit about other coutnries problems and then expecting to be helped yourselves is supposed to work in the real world. 

You see, I despise Russia in it's current form. I am well aware of the shit they pull. Purely by instinct I am more then willing to help the underdogs in this scneario. But EE did so much in recent years to really piss of Germans that it is hard to justify any kind of action. 

Germany is split. There are factions who support EE and there groups, mostly from the former East Germany, that support Russia. And EE is constantly strenghening the pro Russia group while weakening the pro EE group. That is the reality that no amount of WW2 responsebility or hostile argumentation will change. 

&gt; Funny thing how you ask if I think Germans are blind to what Poland does  - no I don't think so. I think Germans are blind to what Germany does. 

The hen and egg problem. Fact is, no matter who started what, Germany does not need EE when it really comes down to it. If Germany acts, it does so because it wants to, not because it needs to. There is no obligation whatsoever towards EE these days, it all comes down to good will...or the lack of it.",,/r/europe/comments/ec214q/us_senate_approves_nord_stream_2_russiagermany/fbdbsiz/,Gammelpreiss,1576756621

45,"Ìm just gonna paste here quote from German who lived in both coutries and summarizes the diffrences between both countries. It's not mine. 

 

&gt;I don’t know if way pay so much less. I have a colleque from the US and he is also asked why he is working in Germany because he could get way more money in the US.  
&gt;  
&gt;So he said that he is doing his holidays in the homeland because he can afford it. So he and his family comes for three or four weeks to the US, travels around and visits relatives. He can pay for the flights, for the car and he can do so for several weeks while he is still paid.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have about 12 days a year of official holidays. Additionally we have about 30 days of paid holidays. I work from Monday to Friday 8 hours a day. Weekend is leisure time. If I get sick, I am insurred. Up to six weeks within a year I get my salary without any reduction while being sick and the doctor or the clinic is paid by the social insurrance. When I came back from the US I was sick. I was in the hospital for several weeks and was not allowed to work. I didn’t lost my job, I was paid and didn’t get any debt, I didn’t have to pay the meds (2000€ a day) or the stay at the hospital. It took about a year to recover completely and then I continued my life.  
That is also part of my salary.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a German I have free chose of the hospital. I am not restricted to clinics who have contracts with my insurrance company. Even if we’re retired everybody can afford the needed meds because of the social insurrances. That must be paid. When you get your salary in Germany there is an additional amount the employer has to pay directly to the social system. So your actual salary your employer has to pay is higher than what you have negotiated.  
So you compare different things.  
&gt;  
&gt;I see US parents who think about staying because the public schools are better than in the US. We don’t have an MIT or Princeton. But i.e. we have the TH Aachen. You don’t know it, but that does not mean that you get a worse education there. And it’s free. You can get your academic degree there and you don’t need to pay for that in the way you would if you want to visit Princeton. If you don’t have any academic education you can even get money from the state in order to study there. I don’t need to individually save money to give my very own children a good start in life. We all pay for all children. Every child should have a chance.  
&gt;  
&gt;My US colleque lives in a solid house. As most germans do. It’s smaller than an American house but it does not collapse when it’s windy. ;)  
If there is a storm we don’t lose everything. Maybe we have to fix the roof.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s not only the amount of Dollars or Euros you get. The question is how worth has one current unit. What kind of living can you live with the money you get?  
I visited and lived in several countries and even with very few money you can live a good life in Germany. Thanks to the social system there the minimum of money you have is accaptable for a healthy person.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the US everybody has a better chance to live very wealthy. But everybody has a chance does not mean all of you will live wealthy. Some of you live in poverty. Some of you need three jobs even to survive. I don’t live in fear to lose my only job. Here I could afford to study. My parents would not had the money to pay my studies in the US. I have no debts.  
If I lose my job I get “unemployment money” for 12 months. I can pay my rent, I can pay my bills, I have time to reorganize my life and search for a new job. We pay for social insurrance. After 12 months I get less money, maybe I need a smaller appartement, but even if I never find a job anymore, even if I do not earn another single Euro in my whole live, I will not starve. I will have a roof and heating in the winter and a television (because you have the right to have one to receive the news) and I will get money for food and clothes and a small living.  
I do not need to fear anything. Live is more comfortable with more money but surviving is guaranteed.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are homeless people in Germany. And that’s a problem because often you don’t recognize them as homeless. They are clean and well dressed. Of course there are also homeless you easily recognize as homeless. Sometimes it’s hard to accept help for these people but at least there is help available. There is a good chance to get a room and money and health care if you seek help, later you get an appartement and help to find a new job and get back a life if you want.  
When I was in the US I also saw the homeless. That was another dimension of homelessness than I ever saw in Germany.  
&gt;  
&gt;Poverty results in people who need to fight for surving. The chance to be violently killed in the US is much higher than in Germany. Actually I felt way more secure close to the Israelian border than in Dallas, Texas. In Germany the poor people are known to be the generous donors. They share to help each other. Being poor does not result into violence.  
&gt;  
&gt;My salary also contains security. I live in an so called dangerous area. There is a homeless shelter close by and there was an asylum seekers hostel just 200 meters away. And there is a dubious neighbourhood. When I came back to Germany I needed a cheap place. But I also have found my laptop in my unlocked car two days later.  
So I am still living there because living in a dubious neighbourhood means there is more crime but that does not mean that you’re not safe. Within 12 years I live here there was one housebreaking into my cellar and they stole one bottle of limonade.  
It wasn’t even worth to call the insurrance company.  
That is the danger we are talking about.  
&gt;  
&gt;We all pay this. So the individual person earns less individual money. I would earn more money in the US. I really enjoyed my stay in the US. But I would not want to live there.  
&gt;  
&gt;The US citizens are way more kindly than the Germans. Some supermarkets have tried to bring these culture to Germany. It didn’t work. Because if people are kind because they are urged to, they not kind. They are acting kindness. Otherwise they lose their jobs, have no money, become homeless. That’s kindness because of a kind of slavery.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Germany you allowed to be neutral. You don’t need to be kind. In the case that you lose your job, you can apply for the next while the state is paying your rent. You can even be unkind, but this doesn’t work out in customer relations. So you might lose your job which is useless effort but it does not mean that you will fall in deep poverty if you don’t get a job soon.  
It’s safe to be neutral.  
&gt;  
&gt;So kindness in Germany is an optional feature. If a person is kind to you it is not because of a clause in the employers contract. They do not need to act kindness. We can allow ourselves to be honest. And I prefer that. If a person is kind, I know he is kind because he does not need to. It is honest kindness. Way better than acting kindness.  
&gt;  
&gt;And that is also part of a German salary.  
&gt;  
&gt;I see the US as a big deal between millions of individual people and the FRG as alliance for sharing basic living with a huge amount individual options. And sharing means that I feel safe in the case something bad happens.  
&gt;  
&gt;So at the end of the day the amount of money might be higher in the US, but the value of the lower salary seems better in Germany from my perspective.",,/r/europe/comments/eci0sy/ihdi_by_country_data_collected_in_2018_published/fbdc1a4/,Bedzio,1576756907

It is there to highlight your main concern not to give precise data. I'm very against using solars on agricultural lands, it is the dumbest thing ever (again, I exaggerate). Soil is one of the most precious thing we have, so whenever you build solars, don't do it on your best agricultural lands. And yes I've read the article, still my point is it renewables take toll on nature as well. (not like the climate doesn't, but for now turtles are being killed by solars, not the climate). On the other hand I'm doubtful because I have a reason to be. Let me explain. Germany missed their 2020 climate goals ad your emission/capita figure also doesn't look good. Using 2018 data you're at 9,15 tons/capita of CO2

[https://knoema.de/atlas/Deutschland/CO2-Emissionen-Tonnen-pro-Kopf](https://knoema.de/atlas/Deutschland/CO2-Emissionen-Tonnen-pro-Kopf)

Your energy mix is: 11.7% nuclear, 34.9% renewables and 48% fossil. (2018 data)

Sources:

[https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-energy-consumption-and-power-mix-charts](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-energy-consumption-and-power-mix-charts)

As an example I'll Slovakia because I didn't find newer data on France:

Slovakia has 54.7% nuclear, 8.7 renewables and 21.7% fossils (as of 2018)

Emissions: 6.99 tons/capita

This is almost 2.15 tons/capita less than Germany while still using 21.7% fossils which could be easily transferred to renewables (without huge negative consequences for nature) thus achieving a nice green energy mix.

Disclaimer: different sources provide slightly different data, but even when you look at France (and everyone knows they use nuclear a lot) the trend is clear. You get sth like: Germany: 11.3/cap., Slovakia 8.0/cap. and France 7.2/cap. (note only 2017 data available)

Conclusion:

So, while your theory looks good on paper, the results are simply not convincing, not for now. I'm not against renewables, not at all, but unless you get your numbers right and come up with results that really speak for themselves, I am not keen on putting the nuclear technolology on the junkyard of history. Simply because it's the only thing actually giving us the numbers we want, instead of giving bold speeches. Germany pays one of the highest prices for electricity currently and the transition to 100% renewables is not even complete. So why should poorer countries, who use nuclear &amp; produce good results subside richer ones with their 100% renewable-goals, which doesn't seem to work that well, while carrying the nuclear risk for themselves, the risk which Germany refuses to carry. And don't get me wrong, if you find a great solution I'm all in. I just want to show you it's not all cream &amp; strawberries for other countries who invested a great deal into green (although not renewable) energy.",,/r/europe/comments/ebuhza/letter_eu_must_include_nuclear_power_in_its_list/fbd6hl1/,Stanley975,1576749273

There is a great book about it by Maria-Pia Boëthius called “Heder och samvete” (honor and conscience) about the sins of the Swedish establishment during the war.

I, as many a teen from my area, worked briefly with the Icelandic Forestry Association (Skógræktarfélagið) back one summer in the late 90s. This is an environmental NGO that has supervised a number of forestry projects all over Iceland for decades. At the time I worked with them we took a what I referred to as something of a “shotgun approach” to planting saplings, i.e. plant as many as you can and hope at least some of them make it. Since then I’ve spoken to workers who told me these methods have been somewhat refined to lessen the chance of saplings dying off.

Sure, randomly planting a sapling will probably not result in much other than a dead twig a few years later, but today's serious planting efforts are a little more elegant than just the shotgun approach of planting as much as you can and praying some of them stick (no pun intended). I can't give you much of a detailed answer, but a friend of mine had a grandfather who owned quite a bit of land and was an amateur arborist, spending a lot of time and effort figuring out a way of planting trees that would thrive here. Thanks to efforts such as his, modern cultivators have a pretty good understanding of arboriculture that has allowed them to abandon the spray-and-prey methods of old.

Nowadays we plant saplings that have been growing in greenhouses for a few months, and most of them still die. The reason is that logistically it's much easier planting a bunch of saplings than larger trees. Planting a few year old trees is actually pretty expensive, but some independent farmers still do it, and I know that they actually spend millions of kr for hundreds of trees from people that grow trees.

483,"&gt;I am not opposed to either of those two options, but until that happens I rather have Germany recieve it's gas directly from Russia then having to rely on unrelyable and hostile host countries for the pipeline. I am not talking about the Baltic nations here, btw., hwich I do not put into the same boat as countries like Poland or Hungary. 

You see, the ball is in tour court. Just because Lithuania wants to unify the gas market doesn't mean that the EU will do it. I don't care where the pipeline is, as long as Russia cannot simply do whatever it pleases with countries that aren't Germany. So the best solution would be to finish NS2 and unify the gas market but I don't expect Germany to agree to that. 

&gt;Please keep in mind EE only started to oppse NS2 when it was clear it is going through the sea. When the option to build it on land was still on the table curiously nobody cared for ""Germann reliance on russian gas"". So please forgive me if I take this whole argument with a huge grain of salt. 

So here's the problem, you are absolutely right that Russia bullies small countries and doesn't push around bigger countries simply because it doesn't have that much power. The German reliance on Russian gas is a political issue, not an economic one. 

If the NS2 was built through Lithuania, and then Russia decided to invade Lithuania (or do any kind of economic or political aggression), Germany would have an extra reason to get involved and stop Russia. Now since NS2 avoids all countries, Germany has fewer reasons to get involved because the gas flow would not be disturbed, and that's what the German people care about. 

So reliance on Russia doesn't mean that Germany starts following the Russian commands, it means that Germany has a reason NOT to disturb Russia because of an extra economic incentive (""oh, they might increase the prices or threaten to cut off our gas supply, let's not get involved""). 

&gt;That is understandable in theory, but not in practice. The smaller the nation, the more likely Russia will try to play power games. So when this pipeline would have run through Poland it is MUCH more likely for Russia to flx it's muzzle then if it had to deal with German directly. 

You're looking at it from the German point of view. Think about it like this, if you have a chain of countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany) through which the pipeline is built, Russia is less likely to play power games with Lithuanian BECAUSE they are less likely to play power games with Germany, the end user.

You are ignoring the fact that now Lithuania will be left to negotiate with Russia 1 on 1 because of NS2, instead of 4 on 1 with my imaginary pipeline. So it is an issue of national security for us, for Germany it doesn't matter because you wouldn't be hurt anyways. 

&gt;This topic has been in debated in Germany for decades, as long as Germany was recieving russian gas even in the cold war and before. And now, after decades, EE suddenly wants to tell us what to expect from Russia in their dealings with Germany? After decades of our own epiriences? And then you wonder why Germans react with bewilderment and thinking you guys are nuts? 

Your experience has always been nothing less than equal partnership. We are telling you about our experiences with them, and it is you who doesn't believe that they use gas to play geopolitical games. 

&gt;I mean I understand the fear of Russia. It is an asshole country, after all, you have my full agreement. But completely ignoring it won't make it go away. And the less connections Russia has to Europe, also economical, the less it has to lose by going even more bonkers then it is now.

In 2014 the Russian reliance on Europe was at an all-time high, they still invaded Ukraine. You don't understand Russia if you think that having ""good business"" is going to stop them from shooting you (if you're small), or your neighbors (if they're weak) in the face.",European Federalist,/r/europe/comments/ec214q/us_senate_approves_nord_stream_2_russiagermany/fbctjlc/,CuriousAbout_This,1576733381

612,"&gt; Nuclear power does not need additional flexible supply, since nuclear reactors can ramp up and down very fast when they're designed to do so (as they often are). Look up load-following nuclear power plants that exist in large numbers already in France and Germany. It's true it's not optimal compared to load-following hydro because uranium is so cheap anyway and the cost of nuclear is not in the fuel itself. But it's also very much possible to maintain grid stability with nuclear only. Doesn't hurt to have some li-ion batteries for super-fast adjusting though.

674,"&gt; You don't have to do that. Nuclear is dispatchable and can even do load following. Renewables can't. France is in fact forced to have nuclear follow the operating capacity of renewables all the time, meaning nuclear plants are operated at a lower part of their capacity when the wind is blowing, because not only are renewables incapable of generating energy on demand, they're not even able to stop outputting energy on demand. Other countries have to resort to paying neighbor countries to take their excess electricity, and/or buying further natural gas plants to supplement renewables at night/cloudy days/non-windy days.

If you use nuclear plants to load follow, they only run half of the time. If they run half of the time, the cost per kWh at least doubles (not accounting for the extra maintenance costs due to added wear and tear). Even France has large amounts of hydro and gas to supplement the nuclear fleet.

&gt;On top of that, nuclear can maintain a stable 50Hz across the grid. Wind and solar are totally incapable of it. It is a vital part of having a functional electric grid that pro-renewables completely fail to account for. Tell me exactly how do you plan to maintain the 50Hz frequency using solar and wind but no other source of energy, I'm all ears. Let me know of the cost, too, I bet it'll be super-interesting.

Yes, that has been announced already. Turns out that in practice the limits were a lot higher than anticipated. It's not a big problem until the renewables share hits 50% or so. Even then, the spinning capacity are essentially giant flywheels. They're an extra balancing requirement, but simply keeping some turbines of former thermal plants may be enough.

&gt;Not only that, but nuclear allow for only a few plants (so just a few lines) and they can be built close to the areas of consumptions. Solar and wind require a decentralization by nature, needing to build and maintain exponentially more high-voltage lines, especially so since solar and wind requires to be built where the weather allows for it, rather than where electricity is actually needed.

Centralized generation also requires power lines to distribute the centrally generated power. That is quite obvious. Dispersed generation is a better match for dispersed consumption, especially when considering that rooftop solar is always close to the consumer. Locating nuclear plants near important industrial or population centers vastly increases the potential damage in case of accidents. They need water as well to function, you can't put them anywhere.

&gt;NONE of these problems are accounted for in current prices regarding renewables. These are hidden subsidies, because guess who pays for these externalities? Hint: not the promoters of renewable plants projects.

Again, nuclear grids also rely on other, flexible power plants to match supply and demand. As for renewables: [even a crude solar + batteries setup is cost-competitive with fossil fuels](Solar plus batteries is now cheaper than fossil power

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6449/108), so let alone if we use more sophisticated ways to match supply and demand (for example supply-based pricing, just like nuclear plants need to do: cheaper electricity at night).

&gt;Oh, and by the way, pretty much any single solar panel you can buy is subsidized by the Chinese government, which is why most if not all german manufacturers went bankrupt despite Germany being a big customer of said panels.

While I do agree that we need to maintain a local production base, that is a larger problem than just renewables, and won't be solved by energy policy.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/ebuhza/letter_eu_must_include_nuclear_power_in_its_list/fbc2s5w/,silverionmox,1576714259

708,"&gt; Where do you take that Info from? 

Before we go there, I think we need to discuss some of the more basic issues.

&gt; And it's not just about subsidies either. It's about the whole system that has to be in place and upkept, with mining, maintainance, waste-management, environmental damage

I'm totally on board.

Question:

&gt; And it's not only MCAs but constant leaks and neglect as well. Pretty much every reactor in Europe had some kind of damage going through the news.

How many of those leaks resulted in harm to human health, the environment, or increased the radioactivity of a bit of land enough so that it's uninhabitable? I believe the answer is about ""zero"", and therefore we can ignore this from now on, but please, show me where I'm wrong.

Here are some facts that I wonder whether you know.

The World Health Organization, the United Nations committee UNSCEAR (like the IPCC but for radiation), the Red Cross, and practically every other respectable health and science organization says that the total number of deaths from radiation from Chernobyl will be about 4000. 

Moreover, had the Soviet Union issued a warning to avoid milk and dairy for the next three months (the main source of radioactive iodine uptake), the total number of casualties outside of the on-site cleanup crew would have been about zero.

Hundreds of people returned to their home in the exclusion zone quite early after the accident, and have remained there for the rest of their life. So far as we can tell by studying them, they are suffering no ill health effects. Because of the very small sample size, there might be an effect there, but there are plenty of larger negative health effects that we live with all of the time, like the air pollution of living in a big city, or smoking, both of which are said to be worse for your health than living around Chernobyl now.

Chernobyl had multiple nuclear reactors on the same site. After the accident, the other three reactors were operated for years. That means that the workers came on site every day to operate it. Again, so far as we can tell, no ill health effects.

Even some of the more recent data on the cleanup workers is casting doubt on the initial World Health Organization report, and the total number of deaths from radiation might be far less.

&gt; There is a consensus among leading radiation scientists that nobody should have been relocated after the accident at Fukushima Daiichi because the evacuation caused far more harm than the radiation that escaped from the plant could have.

And speaking of including all costs, let's name them for a 100% non-nuclear renewables grid.

Costs for the overbuild factor of solar and wind by 2x or 3x to help deal with the intermittency, which is very common in most academic papers by Greens attempting to show a 100% non-nuclear renewables plan.

Costs for extra transmission lines to help deal with the intermittency. These are very expensive.

Costs for the storage and/or backup systems. And not just 4 hours of batteries, but closer to 4 days of batteries and/or backup generators. That's really, really expensive.

Costs for additional equipment for synthetic grid inertia, which solar and wind typically lack. It's probably true that we need that additional grid inertia on the grid to keep the grid stable under a 100% renewables plan.

And if we're going to compare apples to apples, let's mention a couple more factors.

In today's electricity markets, solar and wind often earn more money from government subsidies than they do for selling electricity. This can lead to situations where there's an oversupply situation, and electricity prices are negative, and solar and wind operators are paying money to put electricity on the grid, but they are still earning a net profit because the government subsidies, i.e. renewable energy credits, are paid regardless of whether the produced electricity is needed or not. Nuclear doesn't get this. Nuclear has to suck it up and pay the money to the grid when this happens, or shut down.

In today's electricity markets, especially with the introduction of highly intermittent solar and wind, in many places, natural gas operators get more money from other sources than they do for selling electricity. The problem is that our poorly thought out electricity markets are a simple hour by hour auction. That sort of system would lead to regular grid blackouts by itself because of occasional insufficient spinning reserve situations, and that's why the markets also pay out capacity payments - additional money to operators who promise that they will be ready to produce electricity at any moment. The very inefficient and wasteful open-cycle gas turbines get these payments because they can spin up very quickly. In many places, these operators get more money from capacity payments than they do from actually selling electricity. Nuclear doesn't get this.

Don't forget that many places, including many US States, have renewable energy portfolio standards, things that require grid operators to source a certain fraction of electricity from green generators, and these laws explicitly say that nuclear is non-green. This is one of the biggest subsidies of all.

Finally, these things can work together to make it even worse for nuclear. By design or accident, when an oversupply situation happens, the nuclear power plant has to deal with negative electricity prices, sometimes for a long while, and so they have to shut down. Frequently, this shutdown introduces a xenon transient, meaning that they cannot restart for a day. Under NRC regulations, often they must file paperwork before restarting, extending that downtime even further. So, a natural gas operator can notice this, and when solar and wind are at their high, the nat gas operator can also produce lots of power, to force the nuclear power plant to shut down, allowing the natural gas operator to seek huge profits in the window when the nuclear power plant is down.

The so-called ""deregulated"" electricity markets in many places seems like it has been carefully designed by the fossil fuel industry for their own benefit, at the expense of nuclear power. In a proper market, there wouldn't be simple hourly auctions and capacity payments. That situation produces perverse outcomes where some of the generators earn most of their money for doing things other than selling electricity, and those costs are simply passed on to the electricity buyers, either in the form of increased electricity prices, or taxes to fund the renewable energy credits system.",,/r/europe/comments/ebuhza/letter_eu_must_include_nuclear_power_in_its_list/fbbqxrb/,EnlightenmentLiberal,1576706163

My apologies. 

&gt;it took them 40 years to do so. France has had nuclear power plants since 1962. And they didn't convert, they mostly increased production. from 300 to around 500 TWh. 

On that graph that you provided,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_in_France.svg , from 1979 to 1994, a 15 year window, it looks like it went from about 120 TWh to 420 TWh.

If you do more digging, you can find the exact years that I'm talking about, where certain nuclear power plants started construction after the start date, and completed before the 15 year window end date, whose total output constitutes about 50% of the electricity consumption of France.

&gt; CO2 emissions are based on the entire life cycle's average. At the start, a nuclear reactor costs way more CO2 than it saves. It takes years for that to catch up in any meaningful way.

Yea. A year or two before the total emissions are less than a comparable coal plant. So what? This is not a noteworthy negative.

&gt; 14 reactors will be decommissioned by 2035. Due to the insane costs per MWh. Further major investments are required to keep the remaining reactors running for another 10 years.

What does this mean? They will be decommissioned because they're too expense to keep operating? Most of the cost is the upfront capital costs. After they're built, they're money-making machines for the operator - at least they would be in any sane market. It makes no sense to shut down a functioning nuclear reactor because of claims of cost.

&gt; As for ""they weren't in a hurry"" that is the most obvious lie you could have told. They were in an immense hurry and threw insane amounts of money against it due to the 1973 oil crisis.

I think we're in a bigger hurry now with climate change, and we can afford to throw more money at it. Sorry. That's what I meant to say.

Also, for throwing that much money at it, it still costs less than Germany's current electricity scheme. 

Finally, you also say that nuclear power is expensive. No, it's not. Here we go.


Nuclear power is not expensive today.
https://thoughtscapism.com/2019/11/05/decarbonisation-at-a-discount-lets-not-sell-future-generations-short/

Moreover, nuclear power is much more expensive than what they need to be because of some wrong-headed safety regulations. For example, hundreds of millions of dollars in the US for cryogenic equipment to capture krypton to avoid exposures to the public that are ten-thousand times less than background.
https://atomicinsights.com/opportunity-use-science-establish-radiation-standards/

For example, lots of money to avoid similar small exposures to nuclear power plant workers from cobalt in steel.

https://atomicinsights.com/cost-increasing-results-of-accepting-the-linear-no-threshold-lnt-assumption-of-radiation-health-effects/

Moreover, the cost comparison between solar, wind, and nuclear that is typically given to the public is almost always dishonest because these numbers almost never mention that nuclear is far less subsidized (including renewable energy credits and renewable portfolio standards), and nuclear doesn't require massive amounts of very expensive transmission lines, and nuclear doesn't require the same massive amount of overbuilding, often 2x or 3x, to help deal with their intermittency (a near universal approach in 100% renewable energy scientific papers), and nuclear doesn't require massive amounts of storage and/or backup generators such as lithium batteries and power-to-gas (you might see 4 hours of storage sometimes, but you would need closer to 4 days of storage and/or lots of backup generators to avoid regular blackouts in a 100% renewables grid), and nuclear give synthetic inertia to the system and solar and wind don't which might be replicated with additional equipment but that's just additional cost which is not accounted for.

Moveover still, the electricity market structures in many places favor renewables and natural gas at the expense of nuclear. Two things. One, solar and wind and natural gas can use negative prices to force a nuclear power plant to shut down for an extended period of time from xenon, and natural gas can gain monopoly pricing in the meantime. Two, in many places, solar, wind, and natural gas earn more money from other sources than selling electricity (i.e. renewable energy credits and capacity payments), which creates perverse outcomes in the electricity market, and it's bad for nuclear.",,/r/europe/comments/ebuhza/letter_eu_must_include_nuclear_power_in_its_list/fbbrri2/,EnlightenmentLiberal,1576706675

781,"&gt; They are exactly the same. ... In the end we got barely anything while rest of the world ate what they want and never had to deal with food shortages outside of wars.

It was nationalised because private ownership is anathema to communist ideology. With communists it's never about providing for everyone equally, it's about making party members more equal than others while keeping everyone else in line. You've lived under a commie regime, you know about things like the Holodomor. Controlling food is a display of power, and denying food to people is merely a tool to keep the population submissive.

&gt;Show me the difference first.

Sure. Here: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state_in_the_United_Kingdom

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service

Achieved without having a brutal dictatorship, or lining up ethnic minorities and gunning them down into ditches.

&gt;Bullshit. ... Literally no one is dying from lack of food sa even at worst job it gives you enough to survive.

Arguably only because of state regulation and subsidization. If the free market had its way we would have much more people starving or dying of preventable medical issues because it's unprofitable to feed and medicate everyone.

&gt;It is the lack of context ... always point out problems but not benefits.


&gt;... Those calculations never take into account electricity, analphabetizm, fresh water, restroom acces and so on which all dramatically improved in last 30 years in 1st word.

The Soviet Union also provided its population with electricity, education, fresh water, restrooms at home, and etc, certainly much more and of a higher quality than under the Tsar. It's not purely a benefit of capitalism; under feudalism we advanced from holes in the ground to proper outhouses. Progress is inevitable regardless of what kind of political system is governing the country. For some reason the colonies of Britain, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, etc didn't experience the same dramatic improvements despite being ruled by capitalist countries. I wonder why...

&gt;Can you buy glasses not from that company ? There is plenty of other brands and much cheaper. So they are not monopoly.

It's a monopoly by definition.

https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Definitions/Monopoly.html

&gt;Weird no one broke up anything in europe and there is plenty of choice here. Even in my poland we have 5 different major telekoms and it all started with just one.

Probably because these European countries have this funky commie technique called regulations and intervene in the economy to prevent monopolies from forming. Shocking, I know.

&gt;Also notice a thing ? You never described any old company. You would think that in 300 years of capitalism there would be only those old 300 year old companies controlling everything no ?

Look up Andrew Carnegie’s Steel Company, John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, the American Tobacco Company, AT&amp;T, etc, and then get yourself acquainted with the idea of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act. Once again, pure monopolies that would've still been around in 2019 if not for this funny commie gimmick called government regulation. How about near monopolies that control enough of the market share to crush any competition, like De Beers who fixed the prices of diamonds and controlled 80% of the diamond market until new diamond mines were discovered?

&gt;Fact is that no company survived test of time regardless of how wealthy and how much % of market they had. US wanted to destroy US Steel ""monopoly"" in 50s but courts stopped it. Where is US Steel now ?

Yeah, because conveniently enough the courts determined that there were other steel suppliers in the US. It was the world's first billion-dollar corporation, and pretty much controlled all the steel in the U.S. until after WW2. They're still around today, being the 26th largest producer of steel in 2018. 

&gt;I perfectly understand that such thinking is really romantic but data simply doesn't support it. Like i previously said. Every big company becomes kind of like government, they start to make mistakes, go corrupt, people removed from deciding factors start to play with company laws and try to cheat in order to get wealthy. ...

&gt;If not for socialistic government of Obama few other banks would fell down which would cure economy from rot. Instead like in proper communism fall of company was taken by taxpayer. US printed trillions of dollars without backing. They offloaded fall of company on world economy which used dollar.

That's just how the free market works. There's no such thing as corruptions and bribes, it's simply enterprising businessmen making sound business decisions. It's also a prime example of rich corporations using the tools they have to benefit themselves; you don't think the U.S, government did what it did because of pure and good intentions in its heart? 

&gt;It is socialism when government meddles in economy. Government role should only be as arbiter not meddling in economy. ...

&gt;If that company will get bought then 5 more people will open up companies, if those 5 will be bought then 15 more will open up. Who doesn't want free money when you can open up competition company and get free money from scared monopolist ?

Again, naive thinking. If the government didn't intervene in the market than larger corporations can bully any competition into submission or outright crush the competition by undercutting them and other neat little tools of the free market. You buy up the ones that can actually give you a hard time, threaten your monopoly, or grow successful, the other upstarts you just throw your weight around and crush them. It's that easy to form a monopoly over a market when there's zero regulation.

&gt;Who is saying that and what gives you right to decide for someone else what should he do with himself ?

&gt;Maybe i am low wage worker and i want to invest in my kids so they would finish high school and support me later in life ? What gives you right to decide what is good for me ?

Sounds good theory, until your kids die of pneumonia or measles because you're a poor worker who can't really afford to save up for emergencies. Try living with a ridiculously low budget like £15 to spend on food per week and then being told you have to fork up £5000 at the drop of a hat for your child's surgery. 

FYI, education is free in the UK up until university. For university we have things called 'student loans' which cover both tuition fees and costs of living that you only have to repay once you start working and earning more than £20k a year (or something like that), so that every child in the UK has the opportunity to go to university regardless of how much their parents earn. They're both icky commie inventions so I assume you wouldn't like those though.

&gt;There is nothing free i already told you. You already paid for that in taxes. If healtcare was private you could not only spend less but also you could have option to do something else with money if you were in critical situation.

&gt;What is the point of forced healthcare insurance if job you are doing doesn't give you enough money to pay rent ? And that is the real situation for a lot of people.

And I've already told you, it's free *in a practical sense* since the NHS doesn't charge me for anything. Let's say I got into a bad car crash and had to stay in the hospital for 15 days. In the UK I pay nothing because my healthcare is covered by my taxes, so my finances aren't really affected except from the money I miss out on by not working. In the U.S. a hospital stay costs about $3,949 per day on average, that's $59,235 I suddenly need to scrounge up to pay for my stay, probably not even including the costs of an ambulance and any surgeries I might need. 

Having said that, let's actually compare the costs. If I earn £25k a year, about £5000 of that will go on National Insurance (NI) and income tax, meaning I'm paying around £1000 for the NHS. If we include indirect taxes like VAT the money I spend on taxes goes up to roughly £1800, which is around £150 per month that I'm spending on the NHS. 

Meanwhile, in America:

""*According to eHealthInsurance, for unsubsidized customers in 2016, “premiums for individual coverage averaged $321 per month while premiums for family plans averaged $833 per month. The average annual deductible for individual plans was $4,358 and the average deductible for family plans was $7,983.”*

*That means that, last year, the average family paid $9,996 for coverage alone, and, if they met their deductible, a total of just under $18,000. Meanwhile, an average individual spent $3,852 on coverage and, if she spent another $4,358 to meet her deductible, a total of $8,210.*""

That's £13,764 a year for a family plan, or £6,278 for an individual, per year. Let's also not forget that the NHS covers much more than American insurance does. As an interesting tidbit: ""According to the OECD, U.S. prescription drug spending in 2015 was $1,162 per person on average, versus $807 for Canada, $766 for Germany, $668 for France, and $497 for the UK.""

It's also really funny that you mention rent, since renting is completely fucked in the UK due to ~~capitalists~~ enterprising citizens buying up property and charging ridiculous rent for them. Where I live you pay about £1200 a month for a three bedroom house, and God knows how many thousands you need to pay for a dingy cramped apartment in London. Ironically enough if the government nationalised the housing industry we would all be paying a lot less on rent and your theoretical people wouldn't have to worry making ends meet because of high rent.

&gt;Well this is your view. So let us make something clear here which will show you that you don't care much about people.

&gt;Will you allow me to opt out of national healthcare ? And why not ?

919,"&gt;No it isn’t. I have seen enough trans people to know that they pass and they are not as secretive as you make them out to be. Sexual dimorphism is a real thing that no amount of surgery or hormones can truly mask it.

I think you overestimate your clocking skills, but ok. Even if it were true that you can never hide everything NOW, it doesn't mean that won't be able in the future. Currently people are looking into the need for womb transplants for trans women. If growing your own organs in the lab ever becomes a thing trans men might get their very own working penis. Medical science is advancing at a fast pace. In a generation this whole debate might be a non-issue if people can get all the primary and secondary gender characteristics they want.

&gt;Most people don’t have any desire to do cross sex hormones, it doesn’t mean that gender is innate. Just there is nothing to be gained from it for most people. There is also no such thing as cis, we do not need a word for ‘not trans’ especially as trans is so badly defined as it is. Anyone can claim to be trans without needing to do anything.

That's because most people aren't trans. You can claim a lot though. People can claim to be gay and that they like to have sex with people of the same gender. How do you prove that? It's self-reporting. Just because it's self-reporting doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

&gt;I have no interest in taking cross sex hormones, never mind they have many negative side effects and this doesn’t prove anything. People with serious mental illnesses will do all kinds of things, it doesn’t mean that we as a society, have to go along with it.

You don't have that desire because you're fine with your gender. Of course society doesn't have to do a damn thing. That depends on what kind of society you want. I want one where trans people can get the care they need to be happy and healthy.

&gt;I think it is because it is a mental illness and mental illnesses tend to come with higher levels of suicidality. There is no evidence that it is because of family rejection or that it changes, long term after transition.

Even the SLIGHTEST interest in the problems trans people face would teach you that they:

* Are often afraid to come out becaus their family doesn't like LGBTs in general.
* Get called mentally ill by pundits on the internet (oh, you already knew this one!)
* Are harassed for looking weird.
* More often murdered after rape.
* Literally are persecuted in some countries and executed.

&gt;Only short term. Most of the studies claim this are short term satisfaction surveys.  
&gt;  
&gt;Activists should stop trying to suppress studies that they don’t like for a start. As what has happened with the likes of Ray Blanched, Ken Zucker, J Michael Bailey, James Caspian, Lisa Littman etc.

Perhaps you could stop denying the consensus that trans people are real and that most benefit from transitioning.

&gt;No you haven’t helped at all, you just spouted the same rubbish that I have heard before. Just because not everyone buys into you stupid ideology doesn’t mean that they are ignorant about it.

938,"&gt; 25% to 85% is bullshit. You have more losses in transporting and charging the battery. 

Well, that's one part of the reason why that figure is not 100%, both factors accounting for several percent of losses.

&gt; A 2 ton vehicle takes 2/3 of the energy to accelerate in comparison with a 3 ton electric

It also *wastes* infinitely more energy when decelerating compared to a regeneratively braking electric vehicle.

&gt; You might halve energy consumption for cars.

No, clearly primary energy goes down by a factor or around three. For example a Tesla Model 3 has a real world (= during normal driving) energy use  of around 16 kWh/100 km, that is, 57.6 MJ/100 km, whereas a gasoline car might have gasoline consumption of 6 l/100 km and a real world energy use of 6*34=204 MJ/100 km. Even increasing the electric vehicle's requirements by 15 % to compensate for your dreaded transporting and charging losses brings you to 204 MJ/100 km vs 66 MJ/100 km. That's a factor of three.

&gt; Also powerplants still have electrical efficiency's of chemical energy to electric of 50-60%. So right now your only about 45-50% efficient with a electric vehicle. Because your grid is still 80-90% fossil fuels. 

And of course you expect that by the time the car fleet will be almost completely electric the grid will still be almost completely fossil-fuel-powered.

1017,"&gt;But not every country is Germany, nor rich as Germany, nor have the infrastructure as Germany.

Many Country in the EU are better suited for renewables than Germany, while we not have worse acess to wind, we quite bad in solar and hydro. 

&gt;nor rich as Germany

A reason there will be 100 Billion Transition fund. Also Germany poorest state are the one with the best actual results. My State is the poorest west German State, the neighboring State the poorest Overall and is also quite high on actual Output over 100% gross Energy prodcution.

&gt;nor have the infrastructure as Germany

A reason Germany has one of the highest household Energy cost. The Infrastructure is Paid partly by the People directly. Netzzulage it is called. Also a reason of the Transition fond. 

&gt;And that's where the problem begins. Because this is an EU-wide regulation.

It would say especially with the Transition fund it's an ideal Chance to Transition, while other countries contribute to it.
And as seen, due especially Germany Action Prices went down by alot. Whole Europe transitioning, should accelerate competitive Prices and technological Advantages.

&gt;Some people have to use cars to get to work, they will soon use electric cars and this will only double if not triple the electricity demand.

Eletric cars are one Options, new City planning Trains etc are other Options and yes, more Energy is needed, but in other sectors like heating or Industry Energy might be saved. A reason Germany want's it's Overall Energy consumption to go down.
(I'm not a fan of big of cars as they are very inefficient and are the highest source by far for microplastic in Germany. The average distance traveled in Germany by car is 4km, there can be more useful ways)

&gt;The million dollar question is, how we gonna hande this.

Probably by doing something and not saying it's impossible, even though scientist say it's possible.

&gt;And to be realistic, under those conditions I don't think Germany will be willing or able to pay the tremendous price to get every other state 100% renewable-powered in 10 years if you struggle to do it just in your state.

Germany is already paying a lot and if it's willing to pay third world countries for Climate Goals (Paris Agreement), it probablly is also willing to Poland to help Transition, especially it's partly in our economic interest. Windturbines manafacture are dominated by European/German Company, likeSiemens Gamesa(Spanish but majority owned by Siemens(German), Vestas(Danish), Nordex(German) to name a few top market leader

My federal state is on Primary Energy use by over 40% renewable(including heating and Transport), by eletricity we hitting 100% probably around 2025 and by gross production we had over 150% renewables in 2017 we lost About 3 TWH not use Energy that year too.

https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Schwerpunkte/Energiewende/Daten/_documents/versorgungsbeitrag.html

&gt;And renewables are very expensive let's be clear on that.

No first of all renewables, are quite different Sources, with different Emission and cost. Especially onshore wind is quite cheap and also Hydro. Solar and offshore wind are more expensive, but also it's depends on the Location. Due saving in other regions like human Health and natural Desaster it can be quite cheap(that's applies to nuclear too of Course).

&gt;They also cannot be used everywhere.

They are not everywhere that great,but for Poland as quoted often for example it's not true for wind, or even solar, as most parts of Poland are quite suitable. 
And even czechia which is less suitable is investing in Solar.

&gt;And then there are the issues with slaughtered birds by windmills, taking up tremendous land areas while effectively killing biosphere behind it by solars

Windmills are far below on the list what Slaughter birds, quite marginal. Cats are number one. Even far higher especially endangered birds are kill by cars or agriculture. Also I never protesting against Skyscrapper or more storey buildings as they are an even bigger Birdkiller. Also you don't build them nature parks etc.

Also your solar Argument is not clear for me? Did you ever see a solar plant?

&gt;diffusion of heavy metals &amp; recyclation problem with solars and I could go on and on.. 

Yes please go on, both heavy metals in Question(lead and Cadmium) are replaced more and more and through easy Regulation they could be banned. Mostly Chinese and US uses them. Solar is being recycle in a high rate(not Burning) and Windturbines are too and the Research to recycle the blades is on it's way, but they are quite good Methods already for recycling them and use them in other Industry like Cement production.

&gt;I just think it won't get any greener than having a nice diversification of renewables and nuclear, if we are to be realistic..

I agree on that Point, but renewable are good achievable and some regions could be far further and cheaper with renewables. Northern Poland, the Netherland etc. 

My Point is that 100% is achievable, if it's the Goal for every Region of the world is not up to me. But this anti renewable rhetoric is just questionable and mostly not fact base, or uses old Data. Of Course renewable have draw backs, other than nuclear and both are better than any fossil Energy form.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/ebuhza/letter_eu_must_include_nuclear_power_in_its_list/fbaqj19/,Salix166,1576684548

1022,"&gt;But we’ve seen claims on social media misinterpreting First Draft’s article to suggest that Full Fact has found that “0%” of Labour ads in this election were misleading. That’s not true: Full Fact wouldn’t make such a statement, and Labour definitely has released ads that contain claims we’ve disputed. (There are also plenty of ads from Labour that contain statements we wouldn’t consider fact checkable, but which we’re pretty sure the other parties would dispute, such as “Only Labour will save our NHS”.)

&gt;The reason Full Fact wouldn’t make this kind of statement is that, simply, we can’t say objectively how many false claims are contained in the thousands upon thousands of ads that have run over the course of the campaign. Despite our best efforts, we can’t fact check every single ad. But we can talk about the claims we did fact check which appeared in ads from the parties

1088,"&gt; You mean because their struggles are similar. Both living in a society that rather wants them dead than allow them to be themselves. Things have improved greatly for all the flavors of LGBT+, but sadly none are universally accepted yet.

No they are not that similar at all. Gay people never asked to for be given access to medical treatment, in order to change their body and overwrite another groups rights ( in this case women). As concepts like self ID and replacing biological sex with gender identity effectively do. If you can not define who is and who isn’t in that group you can no longer protect them, it is just a fact. 

&gt;Well, that's a nice strawman. The debate is about gender, not sex. In humans, sex is about what chromosemes you have and what kind of gametes your body produces

No it isn’t a straw man at all. Genderists are trying to replace biological sex as a meaningful concept with what basically amounts to subjective feelings. As can be seen by self-ID laws and replacing biological sex with gender identity. Words like man, women, boy and girl are based upon biological sex which nobody can change.
 Regardless of how many surgeries, hormones or persistence that person has. 

&gt;Gender is all the mental perceptions and expectations we have around sex, some biological, some social. 

Wrong. Gender is a bunch of expectations based upon your biological sex so basically sex role stereotypes. Gender originally referred to grammatically gender as can be seen in most European languages. The idea of gender being referred to in the way that you described was used by Dr John Money who abused his patients in order to get to a forgone conclusion and much of this work has been disregarded since. 

&gt;I've never seen anyone been shamed for not liking penis or vagina. I have seen people being called out on their bigotry. 

Search for cotton ceiling it definitely does exist. 

&gt;If you're just put off by one set of genitalia because you exclusively base your attraction on that, it's a different story.

It is not a ‘genital preference’ sexual orientation is based upon someone’s biological sex, not how they choose to identify as. 

&gt;You're ignoring that ""doing nothing"" is also a choice. 

Watchful waiting was the standard practice not that long ago and most children desisted from having confusions about their gender.

http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html?m=1

&gt;then NOT doing anything is more harmful than exploring their gender identity. 

No one has a ‘gender identity’ that concept was made up and there is no evidence supporting such a thing. Identity is a culturally driven thing and the vast majority of the population accepts what sex they are born as. 

&gt;Ignoring the very real problems of gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia is harmfull.

So is ignoring other mental illnesses but we don’t usually affirm those kinds of things.

&gt;That's why children are usually not given hormone replacement therapy. 

Many children are put onto puberty blocker, with there being no evidence that they are reversible and been found to have negative side effects such as bone decay. When used for other things. Puberty is a very complex thing and you can not simply stop it and then expect things to work out right. Puberty is normally trigged at a particular time due to chemical receptors in your brain and by blocking them you are throwing that out of kilt. Puberty also helps children solve many of their body issues that they have before then. 

&gt;People changing genders is the least of your worries with designer babies and immortality around the corner.

Well the idea that you can ‘change your gender’ is a lie. Notions of gender are based upon biological sex which is an immutable characteristic of a person. You don’t have to conform to the expectations that are set upon you due to your sex but that doesn’t change your fundamental biology.

&gt;Affirmative care really isn't that bad as you put it.

Yes it is. It is encouraging them to go along with something that isn’t true, ie that you can change your biological sex and they end up with mutilated bodies as result. Many more people are now coming forwards who regret this decision and the more you push children down this route the more likely it is. 

&gt;That seems like confirmation bias to me. You only clock trans people who don't pass. However, you might have walked passed a dozen others without realizing anything.

No it isn’t. I have seen enough trans people to know that they pass and they are not as secretive as you make them out to be. Sexual dimorphism is a real thing that no amount of surgery or hormones can truly mask it.

&gt;If you're cis and you get hormone treatment, you probably get depressed 

Most people don’t have any desire to do cross sex hormones, it doesn’t mean that gender is innate. Just there is nothing to be gained from it for most people. There is also no such thing as cis, we do not need a word for ‘not trans’ especially as trans is so badly defined as it is. Anyone can claim to be trans without needing to do anything. 

&gt;Trying out a low dose of hormones for a few weeks is pretty low risk and won't change your body in any permanent way. 

I have no interest in taking wrong sex hormones, never mind they have many negative side effects and this doesn’t prove anything. People with serious mental illnesses will do all kinds of things, it doesn’t mean that we as a society, have to go along with it. 

&gt;Being dysphoric is enough to make someone depressed, but personally I expect most suicides by trans people are driven by their family not accepting them.

I think it is because it is a mental illness and mental illnesses tend to come with higher levels of suicidality. There is no evidence that it is because of family rejection or that it changes, long term after transition. 

&gt;It's pretty clear that most trans people significantly improve in mental health

Only short term. Most of the studies claim this are short term satisfaction servais.    

&gt;Well, what else can you do? 

Activists should stop trying to suppress studies that they don’t like for a start. As what has happened with the likes of Ray Blanched, Ken Zucker, J Michael Bailey, James Caspian, Lisa Littman etc.

1091,"They keyword here is socialism. Whatever you are remaking or making society has nothing to do with socialism. You can have completely socialist state that is completely 100% catholic or socialist state that is 100% atheist.

that part is progressivism vs conservatism it divided nazis and soviets but they didn't care about that detail. Before night of long knives german socialists worked well with their soviet cousins and didn't have any fights over this issue. 

&gt;fascism does not directly oppose private ownership of property/means of production as a whole, although under such regimes a lot of industries ended up either wholly nationalized, or under very strict state control although in theory privately owned. Mussolini explicitly noted that the only feasible implementation of socialism was corporatism, as noted in his quotes in my answer here comparing Communism to Fascism.

Which is another form of nationalization if state either way will control it. The question is what name of formation is and how structures are lied down but if something is free market or state organized/controled. Clearly in all of those cases we are talking here about state control. So whatever it is nationalized or not it doesn't matter when effect is the same.

In case of Mussolini, Musollini just applied communist thinking in different way. Since workers were the one the most important it was obvious that all people would represent different companies and have maximum rights as companies thus corporatism. Only working people should have maximum ""rights"" is common theme among socialists.

&gt; On average, a full-time employee in the EU works 40.3 hours per week in a usual working week. Men have a longer working week than women, working on average 41.0 hours compared with 39.3 hours for women.

&gt; Those in the mining and quarrying industry work the longest hours (42.0), while the shortest working week is to be found in the education sector (38.1).

&gt; Working week is longest in the UK, shortest in Denmark

&gt; On average, full-time employees in the UK spend the highest number of hours per week at their main job (42.3 hours). They are followed by those working in Cyprus (41.7), Austria (41.4), Greece (41.2), Poland and Portugal (both 41.1).

&gt; Denmark, with a working week of 37.8 hours, is the only country in which the normal number of working hours is less than 38. The next shortest week is in Italy (38.8), followed by the Netherlands and France (both 39.0), Finland and Ireland (39.1).

If you then go and include the yearly amount of hours worked (holidays, etc.) Greeks apparently work the longest hours in Europe, at an average 2,035 hours per year.

1171,"&gt; First of all, if someone doesn't want to spend money on insurance and want to risk then it is his problem and not anyone else.

Or they could just pay slightly higher taxes and never worry about healthcare ever again. 

&gt;Secondly do you have any problem with getting cheap food ? Why do you think it is different for healthcare ?

If you could get free food every day, every year, until you die, in exchange for slightly higher taxes wouldn't you take up that offer? 

&gt;US problem in unique because they have socialism eating them where companies can influence government to stop competition between companies. In socialism it is wealthy that gain the most, not the poor.

Ironically enough the US has really bad wealth inequality due to predatory corporations exploiting the American citizenry. Here in the UK we have some pretty bad wealth inequality too, precisely because the government was busy privatising everything and selling off our assets to corporations, leaving the citizenry poorer than before. The only people who profit in a capitalist system are those people who already have the wealth to buy up capital; it's no secret that most British business started up because the rich could afford the capital. Same goes for your Poland example, the ex-commie party members managed to seize enough capital for themselves using their built-up wealth to transition into capitalism with ease, leaving the poorest Poles still poor as fuck ;)

&gt;If government wouldn't deal in economy then companies would have to compete with each other, only in socialism company can lobby government to do something and ""save working places"" and other crap like that in proper free market company will fold and other capitalist would try to tear out that company apart and steal its customers.

Eventually leading companies to form monopolies in their respective industries and allowing them to arbitrarily set the price of their service/product for far more than its actual value. The idea that a free market will give people the best quality goods for the best price is bullshit as evident in capitalist countries; as well as things like the NHS in the UK which are prime examples that the state can adequately provide for its citizenry free of any arbitrary fees or capitalist machinations.

&gt;Since you like that much maxims from socialism times in Poland here is another one though it needs some translation:

&gt;""w socjalizmie kazdy dostaje po rowno, czyli gowno""

&gt;""in socialism everyone gets equal share, equal share of shit"" Doesn't rhyme though.

lol France has been called by Mali, so much for a disastrous colonial war. And it's fighting islamic extremism in Sahel. You know islamic extremism, right? The kind the US and the UK fostered from the crib to fight the Soviets' influence in the middle east and Afghanistan, only to let it out of control when it stopped serving its purposes. 

France is doing something to fix a problem the disastrous British divide and conquer foreign policy has done to the security of Europe.

1208,"&gt;Geographically Lithuania could not be considered Eastern Europe. 

Except that it [could](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lh.html), of course, it's also often considered Central/Northen Europe. Again like I said it would be best if Lithuania would just be considered a Baltic country just like the Balkans have there own geographical definition so should the Baltic countries, North-Easter Europe.

&gt; lol, so much for your historical knowledge. That's an astonishingly ignorant statement. 

I am not quite sure why you say that, when Lithuania still was the Grand Duchy Of Lithuania, we expanded [east](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania#/media/File:Lithuanian_state_in_13-15th_centuries.png) and occupied vast territories inhabited by Balts, Slavs, Lipka Tatars and other various ethnicities. We did also have some political interest in the west with the Teutonic order and of course Poland. After becoming the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth we still mainly dealt with the East, fighting against the Muscovites and so on, while Poland was mainly invested with Central and Western Europe. With all that being said, I am not sure why would you call Lithuania anything but Eastern European in historical terms.

&gt; So much for your geographical skills. What would be the point exactly of giving you facts anyway?  So far looks like you skipped both geography and history classes in school.  Can't wait for your next passive agressive comment containing nothing but **conjecture**.

Not sure what I did to deserve all this unwarranted assumption, but believe it or not I am a reasonable person and I would like to hear your reasoning and stance on the geographical, historical and cultural position of Lithuania in Europe. If you are not going to do that then just please end this conversation, as simply saying that the other side is wrong and insulting them won't accomplish anything of worth.

1212,"Actually, if Johnson passes his withdrawel agreement in january, the transition period will start. Which technically means the UK will still adhere to EU rules (without having a say in them) until the period ends at which time they hope to have a deal in place that will replace all the deals and treaties that would cease to apply after the transition period. But since the pro Brexit parties and politicians can't even agree among themselves what kind of deal they want to achieve, there's no chance of any deal being agreed upon by the end of 2020. So basically it's either crashing out by january 2021 or a whole lot more of kicking the can down the road like they did with their numerous extensions. The thing is, they shot themselves in the foot the moment they triggered article 50 without having agreed upon an official negotiating position. Because that triggered the clock to run and therefore strengthened the EU's leverage even further. Now there are basically two ways Johnson can go: either he keeps the UK in alignment with the EU after Brexit or he can aim for a trade deal with Trump's US who have openly stated that they want the NHS on the table. And it's going to happen if the UK won't keep to the regulations the EU has in place like evironmental stuff or worker's rights. The UK hasn't had to negotiate a trade deal in generations. There have been british experts negotiating for the EU, along with experts from other EU nations.

I'd say that you should extend this to those who commemorate the 16th of March.

Again, all I am saying - much like yourself - give these people the same kind of charity you extend to those celebrating the 9th of May.

1277,"Thing is that discussion about nuclear power is always met with critique about toxic waste and other risks by both people who oppose it and people who support organisations like Greenpeace who are extremely against it and also claim it's more expensive.

Though bottom line is, it's not an OR situation it's an AND situation, use solar panels when possible, use wind turbines when possible, use nuclear power to replace coal power plants. Thing is that solar and wind energy would be fine if we just wanted to replace the current energy requirements. But lots of industries (transport, manufacturing). Need a lot more energy to move away from fossiel fuels as well so the energy requirements may double or even more in the future.

It's silly to think how people are so against nuclear power when they can be designed to be totally safe and if an incident happens the death count is quite low.

1293,"&gt; Nuclear is not as sustainable as solar, wind or water. It uses fuel that must be mined.

Solar has 48g gCO2eq/kWh median life-cycle emissions, with gas backup it's either over 400 gCO2eq/kWh due to ~11% capacity factor in Germany or with Power-to-gas-to-power it's at least 102-148 gCO2eq/kWh due to conversion losses and that's without taking additional infrastructure into account.

IPCC targets 50 gCO2eq/kWh for global energy, so every solar panel deployed makes this goal harder to achieve.

Water has very limited potential and wind still needs to be backup-ed. [Grid-level costs](https://i.imgur.com/NUxhv7C.png) associated with large share of wind (and solar) are extremely high. Neodymium and dysprosium for wind has to be mined too.

&gt; It is impossibly expensive

Nuclear is cheap if you don't pick reactor design by politics, but by cost.

&gt; creates dangerous waste,

There is nothing dangerous about spent nuclear fuel when properly handled, additionally it's future energy resource 

&gt; it takes on average 15 years to build

Global average is no more then 9 years.

&gt; and it WILL choke out renewable technologies.

&gt; ""The objective of the project is the proof of concept of a highly efficient Power-to-Gas technology by thermally integrating high temperature electrolysis (SOEC technology) with CO2-methanation. Through the thermal integration of exothermal methanation and steam generation for the high temperature steam electrolysis conversion efficiency &gt; 85% (higher heating value of produced methane per used electrical energy) are theoretically possible. The process consists of a pressurized high-temperature steam electrolysis and a pressurized CO2-methanation module. The project was completed in 2017 and achieved an efficiency of 76 % for the prototype with an indicated growth potential of 80 % for industrial scale plants[39]. The operating conditions of the CO2-methanation are a gas pressure of 10 - 30 bar, a SNG production of 1 - 5.4 m3/h (NTP) and a reactant conversion that produces SNG with H2 &lt; 2 vol.-% resp. CH4 &gt; 97 vol.-%[40]. Thus, the generated substitute natural gas can be injected in the entire German natural gas network without limitations[41]. As a cooling medium for the exothermic reaction boiling water is used at up to 300 °C, which corresponds to a water vapour pressure of about 87 bar. The SOEC works with a pressure of up to 15 bar, steam conversions of up to 90% and generates one standard cubic meter of hydrogen from 3.37 kWh of electricity as feed for the methanation.

You can have 200% if you choose to.

There is possible extension of pipeline of supply from Shah Deniz and supply of gas from Turkmenistani fields.

Compare Catholics, where an inquisitor or another church official could *relatively* easily come to the village and set the record straight. For all its faults (and I'm not discounting them), the Catholic Church had and has a system to keep the moral line unified and updated as needed as well as reminding people what that line is and enforcing it.

Even if in many european countries a minimum of service is required by law, it is fine, it makes sense this situation occurs.

1637,"&gt; The pro-nuclear group isn't in any meaningful way quibbling about building solar.

Yes and no. To many pro-nuclear people, including myself, solar and wind makes no sense when you can have nuclear. Solar and wind do make sense however in areas where nuclear isn't realistically feasible (I wouldn't want a nuclear plant in Syria or Lybia right now, or even in a stable but highly corrupt country). 

In the West, being for a mix of nuclear and solar makes no sense for us pro-nuclear. Because our main grudge with renewables is intermittency. Which means you need to plan for a backup that is close to 100% the renewables capacity anyway, in case you have a week-long no-wind-no-sun scenario. 

So, we'd have nuclear for backup... but then why use renewables *at all*? The cost of operating a nuclear plant to its full capacity is negligible if not outright lower than operating it at only part of its capacity or not at all. Once you bought a nuclear plant, might as well use it. There's no point in having both enough nuclear to power your whole country, and another significant source of electricity, especially an unreliable one. That would be a waste of money that could and should be used to un-carbonize other areas of society (heating, by switching to heat pumps, transports, by switching to electric, and so on).",,/r/europe/comments/ebuhza/letter_eu_must_include_nuclear_power_in_its_list/fb9mo7o/,Ton_neveu_gauchiste,1576642820

I do. There's no point in our countries (it makes sense in countries that can't or shouldn't use nuclear for various political or geographical reasons).

What's the point of solar and wind? It's unreliable so you need a backup. We want that backup to be low-carbon so it's gonna be nuclear. The thing with nuclear is, it's costly to build, but cheap to operate (it can be downright cheaper to operate than to not-operate or to operate-at-less-than-full-capacity). So if you have that ""backup"" that is virtually costless to operate, why bother with a second, unreliable source of energy like solar and wind?

Returning migrants to their port of embankment violates the principle of non-refoulement, not to mention that it’s morally dubious to return people to places of danger.

You also cannot prosecute captains/crew that rescue people at sea, because it’s their legal duty. You can make the fact that a country like Tunisia is closer to Libya than Europe, and it’s considered a safe place. But depending on where the migrants are rescued, Malta or Lampedusa are closer, meaning that you have no legal option but to bring them there.

Depends on the size of the leak, but the waste itself will be extremely poisonous and radioactive even in 12.000 AD. To the point that, even then, they can be directly used to create dirty bombs (and, frankly, that's the most dangerous threat, now and in the far future).

&gt;What would be the effects of the leak to humans or to the environment? 
Radiation poisoning, malformations (specially in fetuses) and death.

&gt;There is very little actually nationalist media, or if there is, I can't see it.

Define ""nationalistic media"" so I can understand better.

&gt;It's actually made illegal by hate speech laws and all sorts of other bullshit.

Hmm, so they link hate speech with your take on nationalism? Maybe, just maybe, you need a moment to reflect on this. But what do I know. 

And yes the Wikipedia link. We also had to learn about that, it was to highlight the flaws of scientific inquiry and 'how can we prevent this?' 
But not all journals are made equal, some have more credit than others. Some journals are questionable, they are also known within the community. Would some scandal occur, then it Will tarnish the name. 

This however has nothing to do with the subject (lgbt, gender etc). It just means that their papers were bs. 


&gt;Yeah, sure. I mean, I don't know where you studied, but modern social sciences, especially in the anglo-sphere, are modern indoctrination facilities.

Again, where do you get this information from? Are you an university student yourself? I highly doubt it, you know why? Because then you would've known that science is done globally. There is no ""anglo-sphere science"". Most science is written in English, we also have to write in English, if we want to publish. The authors are from all around the world. If you peer review a paper, chances are quite large it's a paper from a scientist from another country.

&gt;All the gender studies, lgbt studies, race studies, minorities studies, it's all crap

If you really think this, then why would you say this:

&gt;Check out the science on race and IQ, or on social capital, and then tell me the current immigration policy makes any sort of sense whatsoever.

Thank you for openly displaying the point I made in my previous comment. We cherry pick our statistics to fit our own narrative. 

&gt;Of course someone who votes left would say that

I'm sorry, I fail to see where I said what I voted. Are people now all reduced to political dimensions? 

&gt;Check out the science on race and IQ, or on social capital

Let me get back to this one. ""the science"". Could you tell me: who came up with the first IQ test?
How did the test scores develop in the countries that use it? And what does it actually measure?

In the netherlands, a white country, the test scores were 20 points lower in the 50s. So tell me; How did they gap 20 points within just one generation? Evolution is pretty cool, but it doesn't work like that.

No, if you actually had the ""science"" you'd have known that the rise of IQ scores (every year the mean is set back to 100) is very interesting indeed. Why does it change so much within such a short period of time? This is a part of social sciences. Turns out, to get the answer to this question, you have to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Wealth, basic human needs, etc.

Humans are genetically almost identical, chimpanzees that live close to each other have more genetic variations than humans have. 

&gt;and then tell me the current immigration policy makes any sort of sense whatsoever.

I don't think we need to import many more people, not because their IQ is lower, but because socially and culturally we are not ready. You prove that point for me. 

&gt;Also the science on differences between the TWO genders. 

I bet ya, that that science is just your high school biology class. X and Y. XX is a girl, XY a boy. Nice.
Are you or I gonna tell the people that have xxy, x, xy (while the person is insensitive to the y, so only having female characteristics, while having xy). You know, you can look this up ya know.

I don't think you had advanced biology and genetics at highschool, but sure, let's just (again) tell the scientists they should not study this, because it doesnt aline with your world view.

OH and btw, don't use the guardian and Wikipedia as your main sources of information. Everyone can alter Wikipedia, and the guardian is, media.

&gt; Or how Jordan Peterson and Shapiro are received at Berkeley.

Don't let me get started on these 2. Nice you have some people you can look up to... 

&gt;I don't see the difference.

Yes, I believe you immediately.

&gt;When the EU wants something pushed on the weak, it can just call it a human right, right?

No, a human right is a right all humans should have. Like the right to love and have a partnership with the person you love. 

&gt;Maybe they should stop ""discovering"" 3-4 genders per month, and then I'll take them more seriously.

Who the F are you talking about? Who is they? You are so, so blinded by politics. When I'm done I'll also carry the social scientist title, am I then also part of ""they"". It's not as if every scientist from a discipline works collectively on specific research. People do different things.

Why do you even care so much about people self reporting a deviation from the gender norms? Tell me exactly why it is so important to you. 

And stop making sexuality political. Stop with the identity politics. Being gay, lesbian or bisexual is as political as being heterosexual. That you cannot understand it, does not make it false. You probably don't understand how your phone exactly works, yet it exists. Have you ever ""chosen"" your sexuality? Because if you did, than congratulations you might just be bisexual in denial. If you didn't, then let it go.


&gt;Honestly I'm fucking tired of this green propaganda, but I haven't read that much on it to offer a good argument.

Stop calling everything you disagree with 'propaganda.' propaganda is a conclusion. A conclusion is the last step, not the first. 

&gt; There have been numerous scientists caught falsifying data or firing people with inconvenient findings. What exactly is, in your opinion, the ""actual science on climate change""? 

At this point I highly doubt the validity of your sources, back up your claims with links to the inquiry. 

&gt;s. What exactly is, in your opinion, the ""actual science on climate change""? Like, what exactly is going to happen in 2050 or 2100? Europe will be uninhabitable? The US? The entire world? We'll all live indoors like in Dubai? Or literally everyone is going to die because we don't be able to grow food anymore?

What do I think? I think we should listen to the people that study this for years. The planet will survive, the planet has gone through similar disasters, like around 65 million years ago, when that astroid killed of 99% of species. 

No, the planet will survive. But we humans? We humans evolved in this world, with the fauna and Flora we have now. When we kill our insects (it is measured and where I live it can already be seen) we will disrupt the sexual production process of many plant species, many species that we use for fruit and vegetables. 

Not only that, we are pumping in co2 (carbon dioxide) into the air. This is not some random co2, they are called fossil fuels for a reason. It is oil, from compressed biomatter from ancient times. When the earth was so hot, the arctic and Antarctica had rainforests. 

NO animal or plant has evolved in that climate, including us. Yet by releasing that co2 into our air, we are slowly recreating that millions of years old climate. 

And this, my friend, is just a small piece of the mess we as a species have been making on this planet. 

Noone, Noone want this to be true. No government wants this to be true, it costs money. If something costs money, we don't like it.

Again, what do I think? Well if we do fuck all about climate change, then I think not all of us will die, not any time soon. But, know that, already big companies are buying fresh water springs /sources (nestle did that for example) because they know that fresh water will become scarce if the trend continues. 

I go to the university and hopefully have a degree when I'm done. I think the people first affected will be the poor. They won't be able to handle the prices of food and water that will skyrocket in the future. 

While you are completely played by the political leaders, the world is burning. Yet you focus your hate on people that have never truly done you harm.

1811,"&gt;Majority sees nothing wrong with the phrase (as evidenced by this thread for example), a small minority does. 

That's precisely what a dog-whistle is:

[Dog-whistle politics is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different, or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics)

&gt;Why do you exactly get to define the value then ? 

The people who *spread* this message have the dog whistle intent. Their values and intents have defined it.

&gt;No, you assigned the value to it. The fact that you accepted their value as your own is of no matter. You could have chosen to see it on face value and ignore their connotations.

So if a right wing populist party has a big swastika on their poster, it's just others assigning value to it, and the populist party has done nothing wrong?

&gt;While the exact phrase the nazis used is obviously german, the wider concept of ""work setting you free"" is widely spread and used, just a different word or two. 

I have literally never seen it used anywhere other than referring to Nazi context. When you google work sets you free, you get pretty much references to Nazis.

&gt;Would you for example be okay with the phrase ""Nothing wrong with being white"" ? Same message, bit different words. 

Depends on the context. If it was used in similar poster campaign by same people, then I would not be okay, because messages are always understood by their context. There is never just a literal meaning. If it came up in a good hearted panel discussion with people who are established as tolerant, it would be okay.

&gt;works sets you free, work will free you ? Is one okay, and another not ?

Since the original one was in German, and it can be translated as both of those, I wouldn't deem either of those okay.

&gt;What if Grand Wizard David Duke spoke highly of free healthcare and popularized the idea ? Should we look at the idea as racist because of the context of his other speeches ?

You are talking about *an idea* here, not an expression. The thing under scrutiny here is not the idea ""it's ok to be white"" but the expression.

&gt;They don't care about such connotation, you do. You attribute them as ""useful idiots"" then, based on your own view that anybody who uses the phrase must be either a nazi or a useful idiot.

No. Not anybody that uses the phrase. But those who use the phrase willingly knowing the backround, and justify the use of the phrase with ""it's just le ebin trole bait"". The fact they don't care about the connotation and willingly spread it makes them useful idiots. 

&gt;If you admit to a possibility of their being more than just two types of people who use it, you're no longer restricted to useful idiots and nazis, but also say normal people using it because they care not for your ideological masturbation.

You have been the target of a 50 year long misinformation campaign by the Greens. Radiation and nuclear waste is not as bad as you think it is.

In particular, I want to provide this quote, from one of the sources above:

[https://jmkorhonen.net/2013/08/15/graph-of-the-week-what-happens-if-nuclear-waste-repository-leaks/](https://jmkorhonen.net/2013/08/15/graph-of-the-week-what-happens-if-nuclear-waste-repository-leaks/)

&gt;According to Finnish analysis from 2009, assuming that:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- nuclear waste canisters start leaking after a mere 1000 years  
&gt;  
&gt;\- a city is built upon the repository site by people who…  
&gt;  
&gt;\- eat only food produced locally and…  
&gt;  
&gt;\- drink only water from local sources and…  
&gt;  
&gt;\- spend all their time ( 27/7/365) in the most contaminated spot  
&gt;  
&gt;... it’s just possible that one person living in AD 12,000 might be able to receive what’s the highest single dose: 0.00018 mSv per year.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;It is highly instructive to note how anti-nuclear activists seek to discredit the science here. They may well know that even using highly pessimistic assumptions about e.g. the copper canister and the bentonite clay, there is an overwhelming probability that any doses caused to the environment or to the public will be negligible. Perhaps for that reason, or perhaps simply because they themselves honestly believe that any leakage results to immediately horrendous effects, they completely ignore the crucial question: “so what?”  
&gt;  
&gt;What would happen if a waste repository springs a leak?  
&gt;  
&gt;What would be the effects of the leak to humans or to the environment?  
&gt;  
&gt;Even if you search through the voluminous material provided by the anti-nuclear brigade, you most likely will not find a single statement answering these questions. Cleverly, anti-nuclear activists simply state it’s possible that nuclear waste can leak – which is not in doubt, anything is possible – and rely on innuendo and human imagination (fertilized by perceptions of nuclear waste as something unthinkably horrible) to fill in the gaps in the narrative.

I didn't ignore it, I said you were selective and only bring up what you can dismiss at the same time.

Breeders aren't widely used, so they aren't the panacea that you claim they are.

1919,"&gt; (I have both Red and Waffen SS veterans in my family AFAIK).

That indeed would not be surprising. Latvian history is a lot like that. Digging deeper it wouldn't be too surprising to find some Red Latvian Rifleman and White Latvian Rifleman either.

&gt;Sure, just as no one forces people to celebrate 9th of May and so on - but due to the fact that about 75% were indeed forced - I have little animosity towards them. 

That is what I don't quite get. Why any animosity at all? On the 9th of May some people in Latvia celebrate defeat of fascism. Yes, officially such celebration are on the 8th, but the cause is still the same. Just like some celebrate Christmas in December some in January. Some celebrate Europe day on 5th some on 9th... Dates don't really matter much, it's what is being celebrated what matters. No one celebrates it as ""a day that we finally occupied those pesky Latvians"". It's just nonsense. And yes, some horrible things happened after fascism was defeated, but so what? No one goes around trashing Christmas celebrations because of evil crusades... The thing that is being celebrated is a good thing. This of course is in a stark difference from the Latvian legionnaire marches, which celebrates a bad thing.

&gt;but I am forced to play the devils advocate here

And I appreciate that, it makes arguing with you quite interesting. 

&gt;Those who go to the counter-protests are indeed Russian chauvinists

Why? You agree that it's cancer, I agree that it is cancer, EU agrees that it is cancer. I'm not political enough to go to those counter marches, but I don't think that it is a good thing. Democracy relies on people to be political, to voice their opinions, to protest when they think something is not right. And in all seriousness, if a fucking Canadian government bothered it self to condemn those marches, then I think it is rather bad look on our democracy that such small number of people protest it domestically.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ebqsda/macron_to_attend_victory_day_parade_in_moscow_on/fb8qu6g/,kinmix,1576619744

2166,"&gt; No, initially it was ""Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires"", later, when National Alliance tried to make the date official it was renamed to ""Remembrance Day for Latvian soldiers"". However, given that it was still organised by nationalist organisations you would definitely not find anyone remembering Latvian soldiers who fought in Red Army, or any flowers under Latvian Riflemen monument. 

That was what I meant with ''veterans'' - the Latvian legion veterans. On the second point - I agree that it is absolutely a problem, as I feel that those Latvians forced into the Red Army have no representation whatsoever (I have both Red and Waffen SS veterans in my family AFAIK). 

&gt; AFAIK no one forces anyone to attend those marches.    And it is rather dishonest to state that all Waffen SS legionnaires were forced to serve there. Plenty of volunteers joined as well. And I would hazard a guess, that those veterans who when the day was initially established, donned their uniforms and joined the march, were likely not the ones who were particularly opposed to the idea... 

Sure, just as no one forces people to celebrate 9th of May and so on - but due to the fact that about 75% were indeed forced - I have little animosity towards them. They were victims of the times. Regarding those who volunteered - I think that is a whole another discussion, as they represent a minority of the legion. Much like bringing in Araja Kommando in regards to the Legion is a bit misleading - it's a valid point of critique (and very justified, in my opinion, in not allowing the event altogether, but I am forced to play the devils advocate here).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Because clearly, you have to be a masturbating Russian chauvinist to be outraged about marches celebrating an SS legion...  

Those who go to the counter-protests are indeed Russian chauvinists, much like those who attempt to provoke people in the 9th of May. As I said - I do not support the event, it leaves a very bad taste in my mouth - but, in my opinion, whether the critique comes from legitimate Jewish organizations, the EU or Russian state mouthpieces and propagandists matters.

&gt; Yes, the event is cancer, but cancer is not a type of problem that will sort it self out by sweeping it under a rug... Even though most if not all veterans are now dead, many nationalists took their cause and continue to celebrate that Nazi formation. And the fact that our allies condemn those marches while our government doesn't is shameful, and ""Russian chauvinists"" have nothing to do with that. 

When all the veterans will be dead it will be a whole another event. Much like the 9th  of May in Latvia will lose all legitimacy when the veterans will be dead, as the event will move away from commemoration and support of them to a general celebration of the war by people who have had little to nothing to do with it. Which is something that has no place in Latvia, as the war was a tragedy - the beginning and the end.",Damn dirty sexy Balts..,/r/europe/comments/ebqsda/macron_to_attend_victory_day_parade_in_moscow_on/fb84cql/,LatvianLion,1576605874

2188,"&gt;Making your economy more competitive by devaluing currency... doesn't really work. It's not a long term strategy at the very least. It can potentially give your economy a short term boost until exchange rates adjust, which can be useful to offset a crisis, but it won't fix a structurally broken economy like Italy's.

What do you mean ""until exchange rates adjust""?  Devaluing your currency is changing the exchange rate.

And yes, it works.  Italy and France did it repeatedly to contend with West Germany.

Having your own currency and your own central bank is an additional tool in your arsenal.  Even if - and I disagree on this, at least to the extent that you seem to have a very short-term view of ""temporary"" - you think devaluation is a temporary fix, that's a tool you have to combat unemployment, balance of trade issues, or to spur foreign investment by subtly lowering domestic wages.

All of that would help Italy right now.

&gt;It can even create devaluation cycles, which makes for a very unstable economy.

Sure, if you have Robert Mugabe in charge.

&gt;The Euro also strengthens alternative tools for countries. Countries like Italy can take more loans for the same interest rate, which they can invest in the economy. 

Oh yeah, let's think that through.  What if Italy defaults?  WTF does that do to the Euro?  What happens to everyone else in the Eurozone?

The ability to ""take more loans for the same interest rate"" is partly what lead to the Greece fiasco.  And let me be clear here: Greece wasn't at fault for the European financial crisis.  Western banks bought old Greek high-interest debt and leveraged themselves to insane ratios on it.  When the American housing market imploded and credit markets ground to a halt, Greece was unable to secure more credit, thus preventing them from servicing their old debt.  This falls squarely on the western banks.

&gt;Except the Italians have irresponsibly become one of the most indebted countries in Europe with little to show for it. What makes you think monetary policy would be used better? Historically Italy has had very high inflation when it had its own currency.

They managed to function competitively with that inflation.  Italy was doing better with the lira than it is with the Euro.

The Euro is a neoliberal technocrat's idea of a good fiscal tool.  It's already been exposed once by the struggles of a single, minor country.  When - not if, but WHEN - one of the major European economies goes, the Euro is dead and it's going to fucking destroy the general European economy.

2220,"Let's compare the power output of the [Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station), which is the largest power plant in the US, with the [Haliade-X 12](https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/offshore-wind/haliade-x-offshore-turbine) wind turbine in development by GE.

Using their capacity factors, we can calculate their mean generation over time.

Generator | Power generation [MW] | Capacity factor | Effective generation [MW]
---|---|----|----
Palo Verde (3 reactors) | 3937 | 82.8% (Lifetime), 93.77&amp; (2017) | ~3260 (Lifetime), ~3692 (2017)
Haliade-X 12 | 12 | 63% | 7.56

Using these numbers, we find out that in order to match the the same output, we need 431 turbines to match Palo Verde's lifetime output, or 488 using the modern efficiency of the reactor. Considering That the rotor on the turbine is 220 meters, it's gonna need a huge area in order to match the nuclear plant. 

If we assume a perfect world, we can place turbines in a hexagonal way with the rotor tips just missing each other with an efficiency of [~0.9069](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing). Each turbine will need at least a circle of 110 meters in radius in this scenario, which gives us an area of 110^2 * PI = 38,013 m^2 , and with the packing efficiency, each turbine takes ~39229 m^2 .

Then 431 turbines will need an area of ~16.9 km^2 and 488 will need ~19.1 km^2 in our perfect world. In real life, that number will only be greater. And take into consideration that this is a comparison between a 33 year old reactor and a wind turbine currently in development.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/ebuhza/letter_eu_must_include_nuclear_power_in_its_list/fb7s6d0/,ebber22,1576598144

2225,"&gt; it would be ludicrous to suggest London is bigger in financial sense than the whole continent

I'm not making that argument (that was someone else). Simply pointing out that in some (important) markets, London is bigger than the rest of the EU put together. 

&gt; In a short term sure, but it would be foolish to think EU is not gonna slowly relocate clearing back onto continent. 

What is short term to you? Because to me its measured in months. London's status isn't going anywhere for the next decade. The EU has tried before to snatch euro-clearing from London, they attempted this in 2015 (said that it had to take place in a eurozone country) and were struck down by their own courts which said that there wasn't the necessary competency anywhere in the Eurozone to replace London. They can try but would inevitably end up with a less liquid, more fractured market and greater systemic risk. 

&gt; City will have to follow EU regulation, and I think we will see immense pressure on companies to move to Europe or atleast set up subsidiary where you can relocate.

We already do see immense pressure and it isn't effective. Look at how well it worked when they cut off access for the Swiss Exchanges when that country would sign off on their new framework agreement. As for following regulation, the FCA is a far more effective regulator than ESMA. The UK will align where it needs to mostly because it makes sense and they would do so anyway. 

&gt; I think its foolish to say that City has priced in brexit at any point given how many different scenarios there are and how bad has the market itself been at anticipating brexit risks. 

As I tried to explain in the comment, Passporting has always been off the table. The British government told the banks and other fin services companies that they wouldn't be seeking to retain it and that these companies should get their houses in order. Everyone knew we'd lose passporting, *regardless of the outcome*, and so any business affected by this had to be moved ahead of the March 31st deadline. It was, we aren't going to see any more moves on account of the passporting issue, it is fully priced in. 

&gt; If a no-deal occures, and given that there are also non-rational factors at play, I could see a deadline of 1-2 years for most of euro clearing to move to the continent. Costly for both sides.

Won't happen, will hurt European economy too much as it not something they will countenance unless growth *massively* picks up. It would be an enormous own goal. 

&gt; Oh, what section exactly? Its funny, the talk around here is that they were moving everything from the continent to London. Now the great reversal has started.

I work in asset management, believe me none of us are interested in working in Paris, Dublin, Amsterdam or (god forbid) Wankfurt. 

What great reversal is this? All the analysis points to a trickle of jobs leaving London, meanwhile GS opened their massive new HQ, a jobs survey done by Reuters about 6 months ago found that there were more job openings at banks in London than all of the Euro Area (even DB, who made a lot of noise about the people and capital it was moving to Frankfurt had as many vacancies in London as they did in Germany).",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ebkgly/uk_banking_system_resilient_to_no_deal_brexit/fb7s9pc/,MyFavouriteAxe,1576598206

2241,"&gt;LOL - A czemu nie Putin, Papież, albo Kim Dzong Un?

Poważnie pytasz?

Odpowiem prosto - bo nie są Trybunałem Sprawiedliwości Unii Europejskiej. Od wyroków TSUE nie ma ucieczki, jak już ci wspomniałem wcześniej, są bezwzględne i ostateczne. I to właśnie wyrok TSUE nadał prawo SN by ten rozpatrzył sprawę we własnym zakresie - czyli tak po prostu jest, TSUE jest sądem ostatecznym i żaden polski organ nie może badać jego zasadności, bo nie ma do tego podstawy (TK również nie ma podstawy do osądzania tego typu spraw, to wykracza poza jego uprawnienia).

&gt;A może za chwilę TSUE nada opozycji prawo przeprowadzania uchwał bez wymaganej większości w sejmie?

Niezłe reductio ad absurdum. Widać że jesteś ignorantem, oddalam cię więc do stosownych ustaw - traktatu o UE i traktatu lizbońskiego. Polecam tam zapoznać się z działaniem TSUE

&gt;TSUE nie może NIKOMU w suwerennym państwie nadawać żadnych praw

TSUE nie zmieniło polskiego systemu prawnego, a jedynie przekazało Sądowi Najwyższemu moc orzekania, czy neoKRS i Izba Dyscyplinarna są niezawisłe i zgodne z prawem UE. 

Wiesz w ogóle jak zaczęła się ta sytuacja?

Nie ma w Polsce organu, który wnioskowałby o niezawisłości i zgodności z prawem UE instytucji takich jak (neo)KRS i „Izba Dyscyplinarna”. Dlatego też, SN które miało wątpliwości, skierowało je w formie pytań prejudycjalnych do TSUE - czyli, tłumacząc na chłopski rozum żebyś zrozumiał - bo ty tylko chłopsko-rozumowymi bon motami się posługujesz - SN zapytał się TSUE czy te instytucje są niezawisłe i zgodne z prawem UE - bo w Polsce nie było organu który mógł wydać taki werdykt, więc jedynym organem, który mógł wydać werdykt w tej kwestii był organ unijny - TSUE

A TSUE zrobiło prosto - powiedziało, że „faktycznie są wątpliwości co do niezawisłości, przekazujemy nasze uprawnienie do rozstrzygnięcia tej kwestii tobie, Sądzie Najwyższy”

No i SN, na mocy tego wyroku, wydał jasny werdykt. I na mocy tego wyroku, PiS musi się tego werdyktu posłuchać

The reason Reddit is so pro-nuclear is because there are a lot of students here who were in touch with at least the basics of nuclear physics in school or college. That's why on Reddit there is always also so much praise about the next gen power plants which will solve it all and be ready and operation at full scale in just a few years - somehow, after a decade they're still the near future.

And it is indeed a very safe source of energy. In theory, of course. That is, if you ignore all the costs-cutting and profit-maximizing interests of both business and state, as well as human errors.  

But safety concerns aren't even really a priority. The engineering, medical, regulatory, economical, environmental side of the issues are generally completely ignored. Heck, it goes so far that not favoring the use of nuclear power is apparently equal to being anti-vaxx or ultra-green - whatever that means.

2323,"Personally, I do think that it is a very powerful message, because it tackles the issue at its core, namely the fact that those people think black players resemble a monkey. I think it has to do with our forefathers viewing black people as less than human, because their countries were undeveloped. They were living more in a ''natural state''. While Europeans are ''dominating'' nature, sub saharan Africa was living ''among'' it. Another thing that I suspect may be the reason is the coming of montheistic religion, one's holy relationship to God, and therefore superiority over others. During this time, there are plenty of reason to view yourself as superior to the African. 

Now we are in 2019. The way we changed about things changed immensly, largely due to science solving many things that we thought were mysterious. Two of those things are the discovery of racial bias, and the fact that we are all descendant from monkeys. Seeing ourselves as monkeys helps us to understand our own psychological and social drives, it humbles us. 

I know this might sound stupid, but my hope is that one day we will recognise ourselfs as the smarter children of our monkey fathers. Because what the racists need is to be humbled down. Because not for a second are they thinking that they themselves are the monkey.

I understand from what point of view you might think this poster is a bad idea. The message is not powerful enough, it doesn't understand the social context of the word monkey. But from this point of view the only thing you can say is: ''racism is bad mkay, please stop hurting peoples feelings''. I don't think that is the solution to any of those social problems, same with gender and sexuality discrimination. What we need is to be educated, to be held in front of us a mirror. 

I don't want to speak for everyone here. But in my experience, the people who tend to be racist, are also less willing to recognise all animal life as valueable, and with that, all human life EXCEPT for their own tribe. I think we can conclude from that that those people have less/no empathy. I don't think it's a cognitive issue, it is more an issue of will, what are you prepared to surrender for the well being of others? Your time, your tax money, the weight of your words? With that said, what we don't need is to be told that racism is bad (to be honest I'm annoyed to no end that everybody says that racism is bad, but that somehow no one is able to say precisely why it is bad, doesn't make a very convincing argument that way), what we do need is to be humbled the fuck down.

More euros are traded in London than all of the rest of the EU *combined*. That just the fx market. For Euro denominated instruments (think of swaps and other euro denominated contracts), around three quarters of these are traded in the UK capital. 

Moreover, only a handful of EU countries (e.g. France) have the domestic networks to distribute their newly issued government debt. Most do not. Countries such as Italy, Austria, the Czech Republic, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal all rely heavily on London banks and trading venues to sell their debt.

London banks and other institutions have know for over 2 years now that there will be no passporting. It is fully priced in. Those areas of business that were affected have already been moved to the EU, that happened before the original deadline of March 31st because everyone knew that there would be no passporting.

One thing is certain, this number is much, much smaller than the number of jobs that have been created in London's financial sector since the referendum.

&gt;I questioned that soviet == bad &amp; conservative == bad =&gt; soviet == conservative. This uses an unfounded assumption and a non-sequitor. 

What?

&gt;I know reddit is a leftie echochamber for the most part, but the fact is that there exist entire healthy societies with conservative values.

Healthy, but not very well developed. It's a clear indicator that the more developed and the more freedom a nation has, the more progressive it is.

*Yes* actually.

Indeed.

And here's where you go off the rails again. Finland had the liberty to develop their free society for a long time, while we were subjected to decades of totalitarian propaganda. It's actually quite insane to blame us for it, if you consider that we have been one of the fastest socially progressing nations since restoration of independence...

&gt;gay people got any better treatment in Estonia than anywhere else in Eastern Europe back in the day before the 20th century. 

They didn't, not necessarily, but neither did they in Finland, who got to develop socially, while we were subjected to decades of totalitarian propaganda. Only now during freedom can we make up for that and that's why it's ridiculous to blame this on us...

Restaurants got more expensive, you paid around 60-70lt for a good meal for two back then and now it's 50-60€. Coffee 4-6lt*, now it's 2-3€. All the essential goods only increased by 10-30% in price which is good since the minimum and average wages increased by 40-50%. Same goes for pensions, they have increased dramatically. Some essential goods retained the prices. All the appliances and electronics stayed exactly the same so it's a win situation for people. Back then it was too hard for an average person to afford a new TV, washing machine, fridge etc. now anyone can afford them.

So in conclusion: 

Necessities increased in price by 10-30% or stayed the same, depends on the product.

Luxury services like restaurants, taxis, barber etc. increased a lot, 100-300%.

Electricity, gas, water did not increase much. It was constantly increasing year after year so it's not euro related. Which in result increases all the other prices slightly.

Electronics, kitchen appliances, clothing stayed the same.

People's income has increased by 40-50% which in result increases prices again which is natural.

All is good. Fuck the euro skeptics.

Unfortunately, many mothers are scarred for life due to this idiotic system where money goes before the patient.

In fact, just last week a report has been published that this absolute refusal of giving c sections even to mothers 14 days overdue resulted in babies dying inside the womb. And still they won’t change their mind.

2593,"I’d be genuinely interested to know what you think is wrong or nasty about it. Granted, there are lots of generalisations, because I’m posting on the internet, not writing an essay.

Perhaps I wasn’t clear enough in stating that I condemn the language of the textbook, and I think that the Celtic invasion theory has been debunked.

What I think we don’t recognise in the West, as we once did, and as is still recognised in the rest of the world (or at least debated) is the role migrations (often by barbaric peoples) have played in shaping the world we live in, how those migrations were often bad for those on the receiving end, and how those migrating brought their genetic baggage with them whilst outcompeting the host population. A few examples of such migrations:

- The Vedic people moving into the Indus Valley and North India 
- The people who migrated into ‘Old Europe’
- The founders of the Achaemenid Empire
- The Parthians
- The Migration Period/Germanic invasions into the Roman Empire, including the Saxon settlement of England
- Viking Settlement of North England
-The Arab Invasions and spread of Islam
- The Mongol invasions
- The Bantu migration
- The Colonial period and the invasion/settlement of the Americas (including other European Empires)

Some of these are controversial (the Vedic migration in particular can get people very exercised), some less so, and they don’t have all that much in common beyond the movement of large populations from one place to another, usually to the detriment of the host population. The incomers weren’t always invaders (they might be settlers or slaves) but they brought their genetic baggage, culture and tech with them and changed (often dramatically) the societies with which they came into contact, changing their genetic, cultural and technological makeup.

Do you think these migrations didn’t happen, or that they are unimportant, or that they took place piecemeal and peacefully? I would (largely) disagree.",,/r/europe/comments/ebppn9/i_made_the_mistake_of_looking_up_ireland_in_a/fb76y4h/,Stralau,1576577319

The incidents are rare (at least those in the newspaper  pop up like once or twice a year) but as someone living in central Slovakia I can tell you I would get stupid comments without a doubt if I walked around my town holding hands with my boyfriend.
My mom went to a company party, there happen to be a gay couple and the woman in the group had to chastise the men, to not go there and kick them out for daring to dance in the same public club space.

 The generation 30+ years in Slovakia is in the edge of being violent. I don't doubt if the politician get more active on the issue, the incidents would occur more often especially in central and Eastern Slovakia. 

Gay marriage in Slovakia is unthinkable within next ten years and the fact that the Slovak neo-nazi politic party is not the cuddly kind like in czechia makes me feel safer in my Czech home town.

In Czechia I traveled all around tiny villages (lots of castles everywhere and I used to do historical fencing so I love that stuff) holding my bf hands, being a couple, without issues.

2646,"&gt;  &gt;  targeted industrial policy
&gt; 
&gt; This is protectionism and it's wrong.

Wrong according to who? FTAs are not an unmitigated good. They cost jobs and can cause you to lose strategically important industries. Like how the US doesn't have anyone that can produce the drugs for lethal injections :P . Not everything is about money you know.

You need an industrial base now to build an industrial base in the future. We have big chemical industries now, but that because we transitioned the people working in the coal refining sector to it, rather than just letting them rot. The biotech sector will not spring out the the ground fully formed, it needs people making the supporting parts nearby.

&gt; Tariffs don't work.

Don't work for what? Putting tariffs when China dumps steel on the European market at below cost price is a good move. ISTM only an extreme capitalist would allow the China to drive all the local steel mills out of business so they  can jack up the prices afterwards. Compensating for the fact that other countries don't have the same environmental standards as us is not a bad thing.

This does however mean careful calculations: you want to compensate for the environmental protection costs, but you don't want to compensate for labour costs. Too high and industries become lazy and stop innovating. Trump's shotgun approach of nice round numbers on huge numbers of products is obviously stupid.

The communist governments of the eastern bloc were brutally corrupt, and their campaigns against religion were part of that.  There is to a corrupt authoritarian government little greater affront than to hold that there exists a power properly held higher than the state.  To have unlawfully murdered a peaceful man is the very essence of corrupt governance.

Leftists who are not advocates of an all-consuming state tend to value freedom and integrity very highly.  That is the very drive which motivates them to ask for religious symbols to be taken down from places of unbiased law.  Instead of excoriating them for requesting this potentially untoward thing, reach out to them and build a bridge (literally, commission a plaque) that places the cross more clearly within their tradition.",US Internationalist,/r/europe/comments/ebl03c/leftwing_mps_call_for_removal_of_christian_cross/fb6xb61/,ShengjiYay,1576563910

&gt; The French Catholic philosopher and drafter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Jacques Maritain, noted the distinction between the models found in France and in the mid-twentieth century United States.[127] He considered the U.S. model of that time to be more amicable because it had both ""sharp distinction and actual cooperation"" between church and state, what he called a ""historical treasure"" and admonished the United States, ""Please to God that you keep it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one.""[127] Alexis de Tocqueville, another French observer tended to make the same distinction, ""In the U.S., from the beginning, politics and religion were in accord, and they have not ceased to be so since.""

So in short no one cares what these mayors say given they dont represent even a quarter of the voters in their own cities. They hardly have a mandate to begin with.

Solidarity Jelenia Góra: LGBT like communists who kidnapped children

Share (9)

Comment (10)

LGBT people are accusing, among others o demographic

The Jeleniogórski branch of NSZZ Solidarność sent a letter to the city council representatives in which they compared LGBT people to communists who kidnapped children. They are also demanding the introduction of a Local Government Charter on Family Rights. ""We oppose actions aimed at destroying, ridiculing, diminishing, discrediting the role of the traditional family,"" we read in the letter.

&amp;#x200B;

The management of the NSZZ Solidarność unit from Jelenia Góra issued a letter to councilors of Jelenia Góra, in which it compares LGBT people to communists abducting children and Stalinist bandits, shooting their victims in the head. All this in a letter encouraging the city to adopt the Local Government Charter on Family Rights.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""We oppose actions aimed at destroying, ridiculing, diminishing, discrediting the role of the traditional family.

We oppose actions aimed at indoctrination of children and pulling them out, or even opposing parents - Families.

The environments that in this respect are trying to change reality and impose a perverse ideology have already led to serious demographic problems, breaking social bonds, building selfish individualism and focusing solely on consumption.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We have already tried to impose such a system and we know the effects of communist experiments. Imposing methods were different, because then the shot at the back of the head, for Stalinist bandits, was the simplest and fastest method of instilling foreign ideologies in our families. At that time, children were also pulled out of their families, training them to communist Janissaries. Today, maybe the methods are more subtle - economic and media pressure, buying cultural, political and economic elites, but the goal is the same - building a new person who is manipulative, disregarding all norms, values, principles, not interested in building social bonds and we read in the document.

Same-sex marriage was approved here pretty early here: 2005. The socialist president, Zapatero, was not very left-wing in economics, but he achieved a lot of social advances like that. I was 9 or 10 back then. To me it's surprising that many European countries have already approved it or only in the very last few years. This generation has grown seeing this perfectly normal.

It's true that Catholic Church has played a great role in Spanish history (maybe just in Italy it's been greater). But it also compromised itself a lot with Franco dictatorship, maybe except in the very beginning of the democracy (mostly because of this guy: [Tarancón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Enrique_y_Taranc%C3%B3n)). Most priest and specially bishops and cardinals are very conservative or far-right and have lost touch with most of the population. Even new catholic families are less committed to the Church.

Of course the right opposed same-sex marriage at first. But now it has already accepted it (well, I'm not sure about Vox, the new far-right, in this point). Even the leader of opposition back then, Rajoy, went himself being president to the gay wedding of one of the high-rank members of his party.

3048,"""I didn't expect such a campaign""

Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski stated in an interview with ""To Rzeczy"" that he did not expect ""such a bash"" in response to his scandalous statement from August about a ""rainbow plague"". ""I did not expect this, especially since I had already talked about LGBT ideology many times before,"" he said.

&amp;#x200B;

Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski gave an interview to the right-wing magazine Do Rzeczy, in which he spoke about his surprise in reaction to his words about the ""rainbow plague"" he had spoken from the pulpit at St. Mary's Church in Krakow on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising.

""The red plague is no longer on our land, which does not mean that there is no new one""

&amp;#x200B;

The Metropolitan of Kraków stated that he did not expect ""such a campaign"". He said: ""I did not expect this, especially since I had already talked about matters related to the LGBT ideology many times before, including during the Corpus Christi procession on the Main Square in Krakow. Several thousand people who applauded and applauded what I was saying, and then the mainstream media remained silent. What was the reason for this August aggression and harassment? I don't know. ""

&amp;#x200B;

He said about the sermon himself, which he gave on August 1, ""I did not have a prepared text of the speech, although I obviously wished to utter a few critical words at the time about LGBT ideology, especially taking into account earlier events from Białystok.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He added that he came up with the slogan ""rainbow plague"", referring to the poem by Józef Szczepański ""Ziutek"", fragments of which he was to quote during the sermon.

&amp;#x200B;

The archbishop continued: ""I am and I have always been very far from stigmatizing individual people, but - according to the teachings of the Church - one cannot accept evil, especially when it takes the form of an ideological destructive to entire communities.

&gt;Then what is the rapture according to you?  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture) I got it pretty close.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike Pompeo and several other televangelists have called for the rapture as well as the ones I had a discussion with.

&amp;#x200B;

The rapture is the end of time event in the Book of Revelation. Islam has a similar but different event in the Quran which muslims believe in. The end of the world is in the Book of Revelation is a part of all Christianity. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is what you said 

&gt;Evangelical Christians are very pro-Israel but they call for the death of all jews

That is not the rapture. There are certain Christians who believe that all people who don't accept Christ will not go to Heaven when the rapture occurs. That is not the same thing as calling for the death anyone.  Also, this is not specific to evangelical Christianity. There are evangelical and non-evangelical christian groups that hold these positions, even most Catholics in the world. And there are many evangelicals who specifically adhered to dual covenant theory. You don't know what you're talking about because you don't know what Evangelicalism is.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The rapture calls for every non-christian to suffer on Earth.  
&gt;  
&gt;""when  all Christian believers who are alive, along with resurrected  believers, will rise ""in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Seen in the wiki link.

You're literally projecting nazism onto other people. Their religion is that they think that will happen. People who don't support dual covenant theory don't wish anyone dead, they think people should worship christ for their own soul. It's not hatred.

What kind of marriage?

\- Religious?

\- Simple paper work with no legal bound?

\- Legal bound with benefits that are usually provided to couples in order to... create a family?

Most of the noise around this theme centers in very legitimate questions that don't actually have to do with homophobia.

\- Religious: In catholic tradition you can't. End of story. Marry legally and stop forcing an entire faith to change their beliefs and holly words in order to accommodate your reality.

\- Simple legal marriage: Whatever. Most people don't care.

\- With benefits: Now there's a problem. Has gay couples cannot reproduce naturally, any fiscal benefit given to straight couples in order to try to build a family, should only be given to gays IF they adopt.

You should.

And yet you didn't lose your minds. You didn't bend. You didn't break. By and large, you've held the line in the face of all those challenges. 

Spain and Portugal have given me more hope over the last years than anything going on in Central Europe, because I feel that I'm not alone in thinking that there's something worth defending around here.

Spain is a strong country with a strong society. And I think that's because you it's one of the few countries that actually went through a fascist period and had to deal with the many scars it's left on society.

As well as this - Mein Kampf (the main ""manifesto"" of the nazis) had several mentions of christian words and phrases within it.

&gt;Also, the rapture is in all Christianity. Even Catholicism.

The Christians in Europe don't believe the rapture as much as the Evangelical Christians in the states.

&gt; Millions of European Jews left Europe because people were actually trying to kill them 

That has been happening for quite a while. As well as this - during most of the immigration to the US - the population of evangelicals was quite small compared to today.

&gt;You’re phrasing that weirdly on purpose.

That is quite easy to answer. How would you word it then?

The extermination of Jews within European history is primarily due to Christianity.

Apparently, the response rates for Eurobarometer had fallen to very low levels, and they believe that people who disapprove of the EU are disproportionately likely not to respond to Eurobarometer polls.

Normally, with sampling, the *ideal* is that you randomly choose the pollees and everyone responds.  But since you can't force people to do that, some subset won't participate, and the fact that a self-selected set is permitted to respond can introduce error.

Poland wasn't listed, but a number of countries were (Denmark, as I recall, was on the list of ""particularly low response rate countries"" and seeing something like a 12% response rate).",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ebbx6b/more_people_want_to_leave_the_eu_in_poland_than/fb517cn/,duisThias,1576519052

3382,"The reason the rest of the country supported Thatcher wasn’t because people felt bad for the miners, it was because their position was untenable and they were paralyzing the country. You understand that right? The UK government had to spend a ton of money subsidizing heavily unprofitable mines which couldn’t be used to support all the rest of the population who were paying taxes to keep a small group of miners in unproductive employment. They were unproductive because the easy to get coal was all gone and it made no sense to maintain government owned deep coal mines. 

Then you had the actual head of the Miners Union, Arthur Scargill, who was an actual Soviet Puppet. This was a puppet “trade unionist” who condemned actual Polish Solidarity Trade Unionist  in Poland from striking against a Russian imposed communist military dictatorship because he told them they were wrong not to accept communism. Even many of his own union members hated him.

The situation in the 1980s was you had a mining union which was unwilling to make any compromises, which was run by a soviet puppet, when everyone knew that the mining industry couldn’t go on just draining taxpayer money that was needed for everything else.

3411,"To get those results, you inevitably need either proportional multi-member districts, or a mixed system with both single-member districts and a wider pool that balances things out until the total result is proportional. Neither is uncommon in western democracies. And to be completely explicit, in my opinion as well, either of those is superior to any kind of single-member districts if you want to really have a pluralistic democracy that takes into account a wide range of voices.

But my point was:

&gt; But with alternative or ranked voting methods, *they would at least avoid some of the worst of FPTP.*

In pure FPTP, the party/candidate that is loathed by 80% but voted for by 20% can theoretically even win 100% of the single seat available, if the rest of the field is split badly enough. That's an extreme example, but it's much easier and completely credible to come up with situations were the portion of unrepresented people is significantly more than 20%. It's *routinely* 30-60% (assuming 1-5% support for third party candidates spoiling the main candidates, and that's just considering votes cast, not people who stay home because no party/candidate represents their views) in all but the most severely one-sided and/or uncontested FPTP races. Ranked/alternate votes should at least keep it from going very much over 50%, but to do significantly better, you need more than one seat per district, yes.

Tl;dr: yes, ranked voting is far from truly proportional. But it's still better than FPTP, and proportionality is impossible for elections with only 1 seat anyway (in the US: president, Senate, governor, mayors etc., even if the House, state legislatures, city councils etc. would become proportionally elected).",Finland,/r/europe/comments/ea1106/44_of_the_votes_56_of_the_seats_firstpastthepost/fb4ml97/,ohitsasnaake,1576511744

3427,"&gt;Maybe. However, compared to intermittent renewables like solar PV and wind, it's still very expensive.

We're paying for the supply/demand matching services. That's only normal. Other supply/demand matching techniques will be used too.

&gt;It could be argued that the stars will align just right such that with a large enough net, you'll be able to farm enough wind / solar to balance out the grid, but this still seems like a gamble as a long-term solution.

The trick to not to think of it as an electricity grid problem, but as a total energy use problem. We will have to convert heating and industrial fossil fuel use to renewable sources sooner or later. So instead of making gambles and predictions on electricity supply, we just keep building renewables, and convert the excess production to gas and perhaps synthetic liquid fuels. This can be stored and transported in the existing networks and infrastructure. That way we can just ignore the supply/demand match (and in case it's still a problem we can keep using the existing gas plants), because we'll have constant overproduction. Instead, the stored amount of methane and hydrogen will fluctuate.

&gt;As for your original point about reactors not being able to load-follow: MSRs may change this considerably. The MSRE was very adept at this, and ThorCon's reactor simulations show the same behavior. You don't even need to insert control rods to change reactivity - simply drawing more or less thermal energy controls the reaction rate, and is great at handling transients. If fuel becomes a larger fraction of the cost of such reactors, this might be a more viable solution.

The things is, even if you make it load follow as good as gas, then it only produces half of the time, making the electricity twice as expensive (not accounting for additional wear and tear due to the modulation stresses).

&gt; I just can't stand anti-nuclear hysteria, it's incredibly irrational.

It's not irrational, it's a matter of risk management choices. Some people don't accept the very small risk of a very big problem, or don't want to push a very small risk over a very long time on their descendants. Those are rational choices based on morality.

&gt;Oczywiście - ... Naliczenie kary. ::)

Oczywiście. To standardowa procedura w UE, przewidziana w traktacie. Jesteś zaskoczony? Zaskakuje cię to, że PiS musi słuchać się prawa? xD

&gt; Jest banalny sposób by to obejść.. 

Już czekam na niego, uwaga..

&gt; ""UE naliczyło kary... musimy zapłacić. Przykro mi - w tym roku nie ma dodatkowych emerytur ani pieniędzy na dzieci bo UE upiera się by mieć swoich lojalistów na stołkach w sądach.."" 

xDDDDDDDDDD

I w jaki sposób obchodzi to ten problem? Te kary są serio gigantyczne i zwiększają się z każdym dniem. Nie myśl więc, że to coś, co można sobie wpisać w budżet i chuj xD zresztą, straty wizerunkowe związane z niewypełnieniem obietnic byłyby nieporównywalnie większe niż gdyby posłuchał się po prostu wyroku.

Tak więc PiS i tak musi wykonać wyrok, przegrywa na całej linii, kasuje neoKRS, maciej mitera pach do widzenia, kasuje izbę dyscyplinarną SN, kompletna porażka i jedyne co mu pozostaje to taki tekst ""ku pokrzepieniu serc"" wysłany w eter za pomocą TVP, który i tak nie dojdzie do nikogo poza twardym elektoratem PiSu. 

W jaki sposób więc rozwiązuje to problem? :P

&gt;Ludzie wtedy pokochają sędziów przez których pyskówki leki nie będą refundowane.... 

Aaa, przez sędziów, rozumiem. Wcale nie przez PiS który łamie prawo unijne.

&gt; To się prędzej skończy Polexitem z błogosławieństwem ludzi (demokratycznym) niż cofaniem do poprzedniego stanu. 

xDDDDDDD

No nie dziwię się że taki polityczny naiwniak popiera PiS.

&gt;Pamiętaj że UE już próbowało - i nadal próbuje PRAWNIE - zmusić Polskę do przyjmowania migrantów 

Nie było wyroku TSUE w tym zakresie, ani nie były naliczane kary. Były jedynie bezsilne rezolucje. Nie wiem więc po kiego grzyba stawiasz marne chochoły i porównujesz rzeczy które nie mają ze sobą nic wspólnego. Taka erystyka mogłaby zadziałać tylko na twardy elektorat PiSu - na mnie to nie działa, stary

&gt; Nie ma własnych wpływów (jak większość polityków na naszej scenie) 

Ma więcej wpływu na własną politykę niż Duda.

&gt;Nie poprze jej szeroko konserwatywny elektorat 

Ona jest centrowo-konserwatywna. Wszystko zależy od kampanii i nastrojów przedwyborczych

&gt; (a szowinistyczny - Konfederacji - zagłosuje przeciw niej) 

Część Konfederacji zagłosuje przeciwko niej, część za nią (przeciw Dudzie), część się wstrzyma od głosu.

&gt;Jaki sąd ma konstytucyjne uprawnienia do ocenienia tego? 

Prawo oceny tego nadał Sądowi Najwyższemu TSUE. Polecam zapoznać się z wyrokiem

&gt; While an expert's license is valid for all guns, collectors have to provide a ""theme"" of firearms they want to acquire, and are limited to those. Before you get a collectors license in Germany you have to explain to the state why you want to collect those kinds of guns and specifically tell them what kinds of guns you want to collect. Two examples would include WWII guns and guns made by Colt's Manufacturing Company.

Having a red license however is **NOT** a license to buy ammunition. And it's just a permit to own the gun, not a license to use it. Transport is only possible unloaded, secured and in a locked container.

To own a fully automatic weapon (any weapon that successively fires more than one projectile per pull of the trigger) you alo need an extremely rare permit from the BKA, the German FBI.

3536,"Nuclear is dead, and people advocating for it are just derailing the conversation. And it's dead for a million reasons.

1, and this is the biggest one: it's just not as safe as people claim it to be. Sure, if operated correctly, they're extremely safe. The problem is that when they are NOT operated correctly, they suddenly become more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. The chances might be infinitesimal, but they are there. Since the advent of nuclear reactors, not a single decade has gone by without a fatal incident. If a solar or wind power plant goes wrong, it's not a potentially apocalyptic event.

2, they're just not economical. A nuclear power plant needs around 50 years to make back its initial cost. Solar  needs 2 to 5 years to turn a profit. Wind around the same, but of course these also depend on the location. 

3, the people just straight up don't want them. It's political suicide to advocate for nuclear power in most places. 

4, a nuclear power plant in the wrong countries is a recipe for disaster, on two fronts. On the one hand, as we've seen in Iran, nuclear power plants are often just a front for nuclear weapons research. On the other hand, a nuclear power plant in a poor country with a Napoleon complex leads to Chernobyl.",,/r/europe/comments/eb2bn3/greta_thunberg_tackled_over_overcrowded_train/fb4a4dl/,Sam-Porter-Bridges,1576504873

This is what irks me the most.

As a conservative voter (Ideological conservative, not specificly the UK party since im not a brit), I'm absolutely baffled by the amount of times the 'left' side has refused to accept democratic results in the recent 10 years.

Anytime, anywhere a western country ends up with a right leaning election result, shit hits the fan. Spouting nonsense like ""We cannot let these facsicst win"", but somehow they don't realize that just because their candidate didn't win, you can't overrule the democratic systems. Shouting things like, illegitimate results, corruption, bribery... Anything to surpress the idea that a majority (Or at the very least an equal amount) of people has a right/conservative political opinion.

While i'm usually the last person to compare the two political sides because both are equally stupid at the extremes, I do think the right-leaning population has taken elections with much more grace. 

I'd be unhappy if a left leaning political party won, but the very fundamentals of the democratic system we have would stop me from bitching about it and calling it illegitimate.",,/r/europe/comments/eb369l/nicola_sturgeon_scotland_cannot_be_imprisoned_in/fb402nc/,Vlad_TheInhalerr,1576497962

3695,"&gt; People who are idiots enough to vote for Tories because they don't like Corbyn completely deserve the full shitshow they are now going to get, starting off from meltdown and privatisation of NHS.

While some Labour voters switched to Tories, not all did so. Others voted for LibDem or SNP. Should Corbyn actually have some vision, maybe by taking a remain stance, then he would get a bigger share of todays LibDem and SNP vote.

Also worth mentioning that in a proportional electoral system, conservatives would struggle (more) to form a government as Lab+LibDem+SNP coalition would theoretically have more votes.

    Conservative – 43.6%

    Labour – 32.2%

    Liberal Democrats – 11.5%

    Scottish National Party – 3.9%

BoJo was simply helped by the fact that people were tired of brexit, and he offered a simple solution. Vote for me and get it done.

3728,"&gt;But hey, learning how the EU actually works is something that needed to be done in 2016, not 2019.

I am quite aware of how the EU works - my fear is that most people don't.

The commission holds the power, and the head of the commission is chosen by his/her predecessor.

The EU Parliament is elected, but has no legislative power, and cannot block regulations.

The Council of Europe is the only elected part of the executive (i.e. national leaders) and they have had their power to veto curtailed with the Lisbon treaty.

&gt;Populism has always been a wolf in sheep's clothing.

How profound. And what would you call the kind of fawning worship of the EU we see on this sub day in day out? Populism?

Take a look around and see how stage-managed and tightly controlled the EU is. The press is in lockstep with the commission, which is why we see pan-eu outlets like the supposedly 'respectable' [Politico.eu](https://Politico.eu) posting [puff pieces about Macron](https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macrons-turtle-power/) etc.",,/r/europe/comments/eawr9w/boris_johnson_is_to_reject_the_level_playing/fb3uwl4/,Brilliant-Mud,1576490515

The match between Rayo Vallecano and Albacete has definitely suspended the break.  A part of the Lightning fans, the situation in the only background of the stadium, he sang repeatedly during the first half 'Roman Zozulya fucking Nazi'.


The chants caused the referee to stop the game for a few moments in the first half so that the cessation of the insults to the 30-year-old Ukrainian striker was requested.  The Bukaneros, the radical Lightning fans, showed two banners alluding to the player.  One of them read: ""Prevent a Nazi from seeing the fringe"", in reference to his shirt, next to a check symbol.


Zozulya's story with the Lightning goes back to January 2017, when the Ukrainian arrived on loan from Betis.  A few days after announcing his incorporation, he went back to Seville without debuting or training with his new teammates due to the rejection of the Vallecana fans for him, who was accused of ""Nazi affiliation.""

 ""It is not a question of ideologies or thought, it goes further: the Ukrainian player has wielded weapons, has donated money to fascist battalions, wears his symbols and has repeatedly expressed his support for the extreme right of his country, for whom he is a  symbol, ""said the ADRV Platform.


Zozulya's colleagues, backed by the executives of Albacete present in Vallecas, expressed to the colleague his decision not to go out to play the second half.  As they explained, the player entered the locker room crying and emotionally undone.  After announcing the suspension of the meeting, for the first time in the history of Spanish football, the Bukaneros scoffed at the situation singing: ""It was a joke, Zozulya was a joke"" and ""It's a communist, Zozulia is a communist.""


Raúl Martín Presa, president of Rayo Vallecano (who once faced this issue with the Bukaneros), has condemned what happened: ""It is a very sad night for Lightning and sports.

&gt;On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had. He spent two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a computer. They couldn't be more wrong.

EEC was functioning really well and it was mechanism for economical progress, then retarded socialists decided that it should transform into federation called EU and EU laws should overrule local laws.

Since then it is string of mistakes. First financial crisis basically shown everyone that you can print money as long as you are german for rest to pay up for their shitty greece loans and then migration wave came down and laws that were not intended as redistributions of migrants which parliaments would never agree were used as such which create huge political divide. Finally UK made choice to quit it because they fully knew shit will fall down with such setup. 

So EEC union of minimums turned into EU monster when everyone can just outbid anyone on any rule they want because interpretation of rules is naturally ever flowing in socialism.

Right now ruling party in Poland said openly that if they knew how law in EU will be used they would never sign Lisbon treaty and there wouldn't be EU forming in 2009. They were the ones who made EU possible by signing Lisbon treaty.

In an electoral sense you make it less likely that you'll have stable governments, it also lowers the bar for entry into Parliament. Usually countries mitigate that by having thresholds or secondary voting systems, but that can then skew proportionality (if the UK had say a 5% threshold, parties like the SNP and Plaid would have issues..). It also gets interesting for independents..

Yeah that's not really been working out for the EU has it.

Honestly, I was ambivalent to the EU pre-2016, even voted remain. But the attitude of people on this sub has shown me the reality of the relationship. Boris has surprised me, and seems to be (somehow) doing a genuinely good job of making the EU run in circles.

The EU's action on climate change has been appalling. EU action on corruption has been appalling ([https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/europe/eu-farm-subsidy-hungary.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/europe/eu-farm-subsidy-hungary.html)). Major EU countries such as France and Germany have elected large numbers of almost openly fascist parties to their parliaments.

I feel like we're waking up from a bad dream. The UK seems a mess because we are open - but scratch beneath the tightly stage-managed surface of the EU and its just rot, corruption and stagnation all the way down.

4196,"&gt; The UK's contribution to European security has always been a point of contention for the French. I wouldn't be surprised if a French president would secretly smile at the prospect of seeing the Brits out on that front as well.

France can be annoyed by the necessity of cooperation, but until such time as she's lined up a reasonable alternative, I don't think that I'd be secretly delighting in no further cooperation.

The other day I was posting on here and some French user was pissed off that the EU wasn't going in to militarily-help it in the Sahel (I pointed out that Estonia was, in fact, there, and the UK was providing indirect support).  He was calling the EU useless and a ""giant Switzerland"".

Any military stuff that France aims to do beyond France's own abilities is going to involve some level of cooperation.  And that involves putting up, to some degree, with the characteristics and goals of the partner.  Those likely aren't exactly the same as France's.

If France is gonna put in 99% of the blood and treasure, then that compromise may be small, but then there's little added to France's own strength.

If France wants a *big* increase in clout via partnering, then she's gonna have to assign a lot of weight to the concerns of the partner.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/eb0c47/wolfgang_münchau_ft_the_eu_must_rethink_its/fb2nnru/,duisThias,1576454344

4203,"As for immigrants / society 2018 - 2019 this is my story:  
\* Got tooth repaired by middle-eastern dentist early 2018.  
\* Got my storage unit broken into at-least 3-4 times (in 2018 alone, now I don't know as it's always open.)  
\* Also flooded wtih sewage water which the landlord didn't cared for likely because I live in an area of this ""quality"" but completely disgusting. Eventually all my items were gone and things cleaned up anyway and I asked them about it since my stuff were gone and they said they hadn't done it but thiefs don't clean up after themselves.  
\* Got to visit the dentist again for another middle-eastern dentist as the previous repair still had caries under it and the tooth hurt early 2019.  
\* Got to visit the dentist again in May as now it hurt above the tooth in my jaw. Newly examinated girl of African origin found nothing wrong.  
\* Got a very short doctor visit through ""small emergency"" at primary care who only shined light through a lump I had on my leg to see if there was anything wrong with it. He didn't had time for anything else.  
\* Have meet four different dentists and eventually got assigned to endodontist for the tooth September - December so maybe it will get better.  
\* Have tried to get a doctors appointment because everything from my throath and through my head feels weird and it may be the tooth but I'm also afraid it's something else and it's so much. One time they looked just straight into the mouth and took thyroid hormone test but that's all and I don't feel I get access and help anyhow.  
\* I ordered a phone on black-friday and when I had picked it up and was on my way back home this black guy outside of the store decided to rest against the wall and watch me as I passed and just afterwards he came running from behind and stole that package.

  
And that's about where I am now. Lots of health-care workers especially in Sweden have an immigrant background so they are definitely useful there, however as my tooth had to be re-repaired and ended up being dead I can't help but wonder whatever having a different dentist would had worked better or not. The waiting queue to an endodontist is many months, the waiting queue to jaw surgery are YEARS.  


One large reason for the lack of doctors in Sweden totally unrelated to immigrants is that the government has listened to the doctors union about how many educational spots they should have and as the doctors union want good salaries and high odds of getting a job that has resulted in too few doctors educated and as such Swedes interested in becoming a doctor have studied abroad and immigrants has been hired as health-care workers.",,/r/europe/comments/eaptde/rome_today/fb2ny7w/,aliquise,1576454490

4269,"So the Stormont assembly is our local devolved government, which has to be made up of a power sharing government consisting of the largest unionist and nationalist parties, which are Sinn Fein (Nationalist) and DUP (Unionist)

Three years ago the government collapsed when Sinn Fein withdrew from the government. This happened because there was a scandal involving a new environmentally friendly heating initiative called the RHI which had been managed so badly it ended costing the taxpayers 500 million pounds.

Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP was in charge of the department of Enterprises and investment (department in charge of it) when the scheme was implemented and was accused of corruption and failing to implement proper cost controls. She refused to stand down from her role as first minister (joint head of government) for an inquiry,  causing Martin McGuiness, the former leader of Sinn Fein to step down as Deputy First Minister, causing the government to collapse.

There was an election after this that saw the DUP stay as the largest party and Sinn Fein as the second largest party (tho there was now only one seat between them with Sinn Fein doing quite well and DUP losing more seats) but since then neither side has nudged and a government has failed to form. Other issues such as brexit, the DUP supporting the Torys, and demands for an Irish language act have only made it worse with no progress in sight. 

So civil servants have been running the place during this deadlock with Westminster stepping in for certain things and the place has been suffering ever since. We actually have a huge nursing strike at the moment because of how much the NHS in NI is struggling.

&gt;One of the political debates I had in that sub was if Churchill was worse than Stalin or merely just as bad. 

You're the one who's choosing to frame it that way, though. And it wasn't a matter of left or right, it was a matter of whether or not his policies served as a central cause of the 1943 Bengal famine. 

[Which they did, by the way.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/29/winston-churchill-policies-contributed-to-1943-bengal-famine-study) In spite of your fervent insistence that everyone who accepts this [demonstrable historical fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943#1942%E2%80%9344:_Refusal_of_imports) is mentally ill. 

&gt;THere's a good example on this thread - someone posted a link to a Ted talk by Haidt - a full fledged liberal, not even close to a conservative. There isn't a single comment engaging with Haidt's work, thesis, theory, arguments - it's just strident name-calling (MORON!!!) and diversion (""a ted talk isn't science"") - this in a discussion about echo-chambers is beyond parody.

You'd need to link me to the specific comment chain you're referring to, but how is that any different than the way you chose to go about disagreeing with others on Churchill's contribution to the famine?

4329,"Germany is the largest single ancestry category on the ACS.  However, that's because the British got subdivided into a lot of categories -- Irish, Scotch-Irish, Scottish, English, Welsh...and if you sum those, you've got more than you do German-Americans.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Americans

&gt;German Americans (German: Deutschamerikaner, pronounced [ˈdɔʏ̯tʃʔameʁiˌkaːnɐ]) are Americans who have full or partial German ancestry. With an estimated size of approximately 44 million in 2016, German Americans are the largest of the self-reported ancestry groups by the US Census Bureau in its American Community Survey.[1] German-Americans account for about one third of the total ethnic German population in the world.

The Irish category alone is three-quarters as large:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Americans

&gt; Irish Americans (Irish: Gael-Mheiriceánaigh) are an ethnic group comprising Americans who have full or partial ancestry from Ireland. About 33 million Americans — 10.1% of the total population — self-identified as being of Irish ancestry in the 2017 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.[1] This compares with a population of 6.6 million on the island of Ireland. In contrast to Ireland, surveys since the 1970s have shown consistent majorities or pluralities of Americans who self-identify as being of Irish ancestry as also self-identifying as being Protestant,[8][9] and are actually mostly Scotch-Irish,[10][11] the American descendants of Ulster Protestants (mostly Ulster Scots) who emigrated from Ireland to the United States.[12][13]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_Americans

&gt; Self-identified ""Scotch-Irish"" 3,007,722 (2017)[1] 0.9% of the US population

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Americans

&gt; Scottish Americans 20–25 million[1][2][3][4] Up to 8.3% of the U.S. population

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Americans

&gt; 23,074,947, 7.1% of the total U.S. population[3]

-

&gt; Demographers regard the reported number of English Americans as a serious undercount, as the index of inconsistency is high and many if not most Americans from English stock have a tendency to identify simply as ""Americans""[6][7][8][9] or if of mixed European ancestry, identify with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group.[10] 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Americans

4380,"&gt; It's a bit moot now obviously as it's not happening, but I think we've just seen in the GE that a lot of Labour support wouldn't have gone to remain. I'd have been very surprised if any referendum hadn't gone to leave.

You know, there are [lots of polls](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/if-a-second-eu-referendum-were-held-today-how-would-you-vote/) about it, that have consistently shown remain winning a second referendum since what, 2017? 

&gt; The Tories aren't hard right, and Brexit, and indeed broad support for leaving the EU has been a left wing position as much as it has been a right wing one. The last few years saw a little more polarisation, but then again, we've just seen it is far from an extremist position, or one limited to the hard right.

The Tories are not hard-right. The Brexit project is. Historically there has been left-wing opposition to the EU, of which Corbyn is a remnant, but the current Brexit was started by the UKIP, embraced enthusiastically by the likes of EDL and BNP, and after it went mainstream by the billionaire class that wanted to turn Britain into a deregulated tax haven without an welfare state. Singapore on the Thames, is what they call it. Oh, and not to forget the enthusiastic support from Bannon and Trump.

4408,"&gt; It is official russian policy toward use of nukes.

-

&gt;Again. It is official Russian Federation policy   

Hey, you know what else is official Russian policy? Freedom of speech, not executing your citizens, separation of powers, the government not stealing, defending Ukraine's territorial integrity, sanctioning North Korea or many of those international treaties that Russia doesn't seem to care about when they research or use banned weapons.     Thank God these things are official Russian policy otherwise Russia  could be quite a problematic country for its citizens and others.   


  &gt;Do you think US or any other nation will see it as childish and ignore it ?   

Yes totally.    What's more childish than saying ""I don't care about your nukes but  I will use nukes for whatever so now I'm the only one whose nukes have  to be respected!""... Not that Russia is saying that, no you claim that's how it works. Again I ask what are you going to think if other countries make the same declaration? Especially when they conflict  with each other?   


&gt;Actually that changes everything.   

It changes nothing. I asked you for concrete things that would happen as a result of the US not being invited and you ignored that. Cause it doesn't change anything.      

Invitations, casus belli, these things are irrelevant in international politics IMO. They only matter to the extent the government has to justify its actions to its citizens. In reality countries do what they think is in their interest and what they can get away with. Everything else is just a post-factum justification, if one justification doesn't work they'll just look for another. Because it's not the justification that matters but the  goal. These justifications  are often hilariously unconvincing and anyone who's not brainwashed, nationalistic or stupid can see through them.     

&gt;?? Russia is there to defend Syrian nation from invaders. That is their casus bali and actually it is great casus beli.  

Ah yes, wanting  to help  a foreign brutal dictator continue his reign of terror and chemical weapon abuse is a great casus belli for starting nuclear world war.

4410,"&gt;You know, there are lots of polls about it, that have consistently shown remain winning a second referendum since what, 2017?

By tiny margins most of the time, in fact they have generally been around what they were in the run up to the referendum, and that's with continuous remain campaigning. And yet we just had an election in which barely 20% of the votes went to outright remain parties..

&gt;The Tories are not hard-right. The Brexit project is. Historically there has been left-wing opposition to the EU, of which Corbyn is a remnant, but the current Brexit was started by the UKIP, embraced enthusiastically by the likes of EDL and BNP, and after it went mainstream by the billionaire class that wanted to turn Britain into a deregulated tax haven without an welfare state. Singapore on the Thames, is what they call it. Oh, and not to forget the enthusiastic support from Bannon and Trump.

That's really quite an interesting re-writing of the history of Euroscepticism in the UK and indeed of how UKIP managed to get what they did. Either way, it isn't UKIP taking the UK Out of the EU, it is the distinctly not hard right Tories, and both the Tories and Labour have had issues with leave support within their parties.. The reason 52% of voters supported leaving the EU is because they were offered a choice, not because they bought into a far right idea..

&gt;Now, to think that you could hijack this hard-right project and use it to turn the UK into a less neoliberal country than the EU would allow? That's for the birds.

It's not a hard right project, and it doesn't need hijacking.

But Spain was the bad guy for forcing separatists to respect the rights of the rest of the Spaniards, even though Catalonia can freely have any referendum they want about literally anything as long as they understand that a democracy is a system in which everybody decides.

On the original post, several Redditors from the Balkans pointed out interesting things about katuns in their countries.

As Redditor [Romphaia](https://www.reddit.com/user/Romphaia/) noted, there is a word for katun in Albanian - katund.  


[Toskoid](https://www.reddit.com/user/toskoid/) added that katunar, especially in Northern Albania is used as a severe insult to describe uneducated and low-intelligent villager.  
In Istria, according to [suberEE](https://www.reddit.com/user/suberEE/), Katunar is a common last name which indicates it has a totally different meaning than in Albania. In addition, cătun is a word in Romania that describes the same type of mountain village apparently.

He has the complete opposite politics and economics as me, but he understood completely that Greece needed to leave the euro and default on its never payable debt to return to growth. He was willing to do the unpopular thing for the good of his country and he was sacked by Tsipras for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the US, the economy is everything. The last time that the US had an economic depression similar to Greece in the 1930s the government freaked out and reorganized the entire economy. Some of the things they did were stupid, but they were at least trying. Greece's economic depression was worse than the one the US had in the 1930s and the only thing that has occurred is the EU and Greek government ""extending and pretending"" the debt because French and German banks can't take a loss on their loans to the Greek government. There's no sense of urgency.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of this: The Greek Birth rate is only 1.33 children per woman. Then, you have a hollowed out population of youth because so many young educated people have had to leave Greece over the past decade to have better fortunes elsewhere. That's why more drastic measures needed to have been taken years ago. There was no sense of urgency to fix the economic crisis quickly because it would cause Greece to lose the few youth that it had and needed to keep. Now the country is long term fucked and going to turn into an impoverished retirement home in 50 years because of apathy. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a troika of 3 groups that lent money to Greece, the European Central Bank, the IMF, and the European Commission. The IMF is not an EU organization, it's an international fund designed to help governments funded by nearly every country. The IMF wanted to renegotiate and write off Greek debt early on because their economists said ""there is no way Greece can pay this off so let is go through an orderly bankruptcy to get back on its feet"". The reason that didn't happen was because the European Central Bank and European Commission didn't want the threaten the long term surviviability of the euro and they were more concerned about how the politics effected their own politics as EU members than they were about Greece's economy.",,/r/europe/comments/eaptde/rome_today/fb15zv3/,CheWeNeedYou,1576432760

Today the media will paint a picture of the racist right hating anyone coming into their country vs the naive hippie left, who wants to do away with international boarders. The reality is that very few people actually think in these extremes. 

Whenever immigration is brought up, people will say basically something along the lines of what you just said. While somewhat factual, it ignores many legitimate concerns, such as just many people can we let in? At what rate can we integrate people? What issues does this present for society? Whenever someone brings these points up, or acknowledges that integrating a migrant from your neighbouring country is far easier than someone from another continent, the left will simply dismiss this as racism and move on. This is not the way to address these concerns or have a grown up debate.

Another point that right wing voters get annoyed with is the left claiming most migrants are coming from desperate places filled with famine, war, etc. They're not. They're mostly economic migrants looking for more pay.

On the topic of background checks you're point sounds rather odd, because I've never heard a conservative argue against background checks for migrants. Background checks on citizens and migrants are two completely different topics.

If you don't want a right wing government in your country then do something about their voter bases legitimate concerns. Instead of organising a large protest of left wingers patting themselves on the back. If your left wing party's response to migration concerns is ""Let everyone is, what could go wrong"" you're going to shit in the polls.

I'm not ignoring the shitty things the right do or say. I'm just trying to point out that you simply have to be the grownup in the situation and not resort to their level then.

The NI only solution was the EU's first idea, not a concession to Johnson. So saying  ""The purpose of the backstop was to keep Britain under control"" is wrong. The purpose of the backstop was to avoid a border on Ireland. Mission accomplished EU.

Now in Johnson's agreement the EU and Ireland have a NI only backstop solution, and the UK can't unilaterally escape from it because it requires NI nationalists to vote for something they are set up to oppose - a border on the island of Ireland. That will never happen, so the NI backstop Ireland wanted is inescapable for the UK. So saying "" Northern Ireland can at any point switch to UK regulations "" is incomplete, because the mechanism means it never can. Mission accomplished EU.

Johnson's deal signed up to a joint committee to decide what checks need to be done when Britain exports to NI. The UK doesn't have a veto on those checks. The checks will be whatever the EU deems necessary to protect the single market. Mission accomplished EU.

And the UK will pay the same amount as may's deal stipulated. Mission accomplished EU.

BTW Free ports were never banned by EU membership. The UK could have had them anytime. The only thing it couldn't do is give state aid to companies in them. In the FTA the UK will sign up to the same kind of state aid will be banned along with lots of other level playing field regulations.

All major languages have a standard version. Someone who speaks english will often be able to use that standard version (even with an accent), no matter where they are from. Similarly, most foreigners will learn a standardised version of English, whether it's american, british or otherwise.

If your idiolect is so idiomatic that foreign people don't understand what you say, then you're very likely doing it on purpose. Or maybe your idiom is not the problem, and you need to speak a simpler english for an audience that has only a relatively basic level in english. We don't really need an article to tell us that foreigners don't always have a great level in english, and that you may have to clarify things to be understood...

4637," Meh, both sides have rights and wrongs. As an outsider from Latin America, the majority of the people here not just in a single country but the continent see America, Canada, Europe, Australia, etc, mostly the white-majority nations, as the laughing stock of the world. And that has nothing to do with your guys' skin color, but because for those who follow what's going around the world, when we see you guys complaining and protesting against say Trump or any other world leader who's right-wing, all we see are a bunch of man-children whining despite having it better than the rest of the world. Come to Venezuela or Cuba, or Bolivia, we'd love to see how long you last here. xD And I, nor most people I'd say, are right-wingers here in Latin America, but we sure as hell don't behave like you guys. Then we see things like you guys allowing men to dress up in heavy women's clothing to teach little innocent kids or inventing a bazillion new genders yet you say you guys believe in science. I think you guys call those men dracks or drags, something like that.

We'd also like for you guys to stop pretending like you care about us by taking some sort of moral high ground. We don't need anyone to defend us or speak up for us. We're not being oppressed and we quite like it here, despite us having the biggest homicide problems of any region in the world. We feel like white people have had it so good that you guys have grown super soft. Most people here as young as teenagers know how to fix (or at least handle) cars, cook, basically survive off of what we have, and we are very grateful to God for everything we have. We stay together as a family and protect them. Also, we are realistic. You guys may notice that we basically don't have any Muslims here, nor do Islamic countries have much Latinos. Well, we like it like that. Our views are very different from theirs, we don't want them staying in masses in our countries nor do they want us staying in masses in their countries, and both of us are fine with that. You guys keep taking people from all different cultures and races into your countries only causing instability, but tbh you guys can have them and anyone from our countries who wants to immigrate there, more peace to us, you guys deal with the consequences. Oh and of course people, including Muslims, can visit our countries all they want, but staying only to cause cultural problems is a no-no here.

All of that being said, most people here don't hate any white-majority countries. I myself love America, and while I have never been to Europe, I love you guys too for everything you have brought for the world. The progress that white-majority countries have had over the centuries compared to Asian, Arabic or Latin American countries is substantially bigger, and that's great, which is why we find it hilarious and awfully confusing that instead of defending your pride and culture you guys would rather give it all away and let your historical countries fall just because of some sort of personal vendetta from your people? Just so you know, nobody sees white-people here as a bunch of genocidal maniacs. Nobody blames you for the death of thousands of indigenous people, because we did the same to a lot of white men too. What's in the past is in the past, and if it wasn't for Cristobal Colon none of us Latinos would be here. So we are vary grateful for everything you have brought to the world.",,/r/europe/comments/eaws4d/finland_is_winning_the_war_on_fake_news_the/fb0ijtz/,Wild_Roamer,1576426311

After the 2008 financial crisis Labour progressively became more left wing until they got to Corbyn and McDonnell. I think this alienated a lot of people who had voted Labour in the past or who were old enough to remember the 1970's. Corbyn was a bit toxic due to his past associations hard left fringe movements and terrorists. He was very slow to condemn the anti-Semitism claims and failed in flipping it back at the Conservatives with Islamophobia. In addition since the financial crisis I think people have become more wary of government borrowing and things like that, Labour's manifesto was not fully costed, which certainly concerned some voters- though it should be noted of the major parties only the Lib Dems had a fully costed manifesto. Brexit was probably the nail in the coffin, the parliamentary party was very anti-Brexit, Corbyn was on the fence, but the people in the Labour heartlands were all quite pro-Brexit. The conservatives had a fairly simple ""get Brexit done"" policy which appealed to a lot of people after 4 years of uncertainty as to whether Brexit would happen at all. The Labour policy was to hold another referendum, there was also a lot of rhetoroc along the lines of racist troglodytes voted for Brexit and stuff like that.

A scandal involving the illegal burning and disposal of garbage went some new developments. A little background here: some thermal power stations are burning garbage instead of coal because it's much more profitable. However it turned out that it's causing even more pollution than coal and they are burning types of garbage they aren't supposed to so a couple of power stations got temporarily shut down.

Three days ago the administrative court in Stara Zagora ruled that TPS ""Brikel"" has incorrectly been granted a permission to burn garbage without any analysis on the impact on the environment or public health. 

Yesterday the administrative court in Sofia has ruled that the Ministry of environment and water must make public all documents regarding the imports of garbage in the country for 2017 and 2018, including how this garbage was used due to suspicion other countries may be using us as a garbage dump.

On an unrelated note, the government is trying to seize private land from citizens in Sofia for a new infrastructure project, compensating them only between 0.14 and 25BGN(0.072 and 12.78 Euro respectively) per square meter which is laughably below market price.

Not too long ago, some people used to point and laugh at China for being a poor, dirty, rural country. But suddenly, China is scarier than Godzilla. Their anti-China hysteria shows today because they are scared of China's rising prosperity and progress and anxious about their own country's economic stagnation.

&gt; giving the West time to shun Huawei and the Chinese administration long before we are totally dependent on either. 

Lol. Europe literally makes nothing in the realm of smart phones, for example. Huawei and Xiaomi control 20% of Germany's smart phone market. Huawei makes more affordable with the same quality as Apple, and it's a complete and total no-brainer to prefer Huawei. Huawei will prevail against its competitors, there's nothing that Trump or Brussels can do about it, and their outcry is only going to help Huawei and other Chinese brands establish 100% dominance of China and condemn Apple to irrelevance.

&gt; China is showing its true colours early 

What true colors? China is not a small, defenseless country. It's not Iraq and China will defend herself. Western countries have attacked and repressed Huawei. They literally arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei official, for no reason.

5053,"&gt;Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, and its defence minister, Hulusi Akar met with Serraj on the sidelines of a major diplomatic conference in Doha, Qatar at the weekend. Çavuşoğlu, speaking in Doha, said no formal request for troops has yet been made by the GNA, but added “sending troops is the easiest way”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Haftar’s airforce, backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, has already bombed the airport of the coastal town of Misrata in a warning to Turkey not to send troops or further supplies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Turkey, along with the UAE, was formally found by the UN to be breaking the UN arms embargo, but the Turkish government seems determined not to let Tripoli to fall into hands of the UAE-backed Haftar.

This is very interesting. So is Turkey more aligned with Qatar and oposes other Gulf countries? Or what is the game here?

&gt; Ankara’s actions risk an anti-Turkish coalition forming comprising Greece, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Italy. These countries came together under the umbrella of the eastern Mediterranean gas forum – an outwardly energy-related but ultimately military partnership from which Turkey was excluded.

&gt;The trouble is that for the time being, with hate speech on the internet so far beyond the reach of national laws, the only restrictions that apply to it are decided by private companies and on a case-by-case basis. Guillaume Debré says it is time that this global problem received a global solution. ""Without it,"" he says, ""you're going to have more Westhoffens, more Quatzenheims and others and not just in France but in New Zealand and in America.""

&gt;It is an issue on which France is seeking to lead the way in the wake of the Christchurch attack, live-streamed on the internet. Soon after, the French government announced a bill, now working its way through the parliament, that seeks to force social media platforms to be responsible for the content they distribute. Companies like Facebook would have 24 hours to take hate speech down after users flagged it or face a hefty fine.

Of course not. I'm against Brexit because it is a disaster for the UK, and (to a lesser extent) bad for the rest of EU. We would have been better together. But given the current situation it would be better for everyone if Scotland remained in the EU. It would make a bad situation a little less bad. The UK becomes less divided and can focus on building a strong future by themselves. The Scots get a chance of governing themselves with backup from the EU, giving them access to the inner market and all the other benefits.

This mass protest is not against Salvini's ideas per se, but about the way he exemplifies a certain way current politicians, **both left and right**, communicate their ideas and the way this verbal violence trickles down to the common people.

Salvini, and before him Berlusconi, are like Trump in a way, as they boast ""they say things as they are"". Many people, including this movement, think that politicians should be held to a higher standard than common people.

Back in the first decades of the post war Italy, for example, no politician, regardless of their orientation, would insult their opponent with derogatory language. 

Salvini and  his party routinely shamed the former president of house of deputies, calling her on social media whore, wishing her, a former spokesperson for UNCHR and a relentless campaigner against domestic violence, to be raped by black men, since she is pro immigration.  At a political rally of his party, he brought an inflatable doll and presented it as a double for her.

I do not even like her in general, but more because her targets are often IMO misplaced. I try to criticise her ideas, not her persona.

5493,"&gt; eu membership was one of the main reasons why scotland voted to stay in the uk.

According to the Ashcroft poll after the referendum, the EU was cited as a reason for voting no by 15%. That's behind The Pound (57%), Pensions (37%), The NHS (36%), Tax and Public Spending (32%), Defence and Security (29%), Jobs (21%). In fact, far more Scots voted to leave the EU than cited it as a reason to vote No in the independence referendum.

5514,"&gt; That was already clear in 2013. The CDU was in fact trying to get the SPD on board long before any coalition talks started.

Of course they were. For the CDU, having a second option to pressure the Greens and the FDP was important. This is basic negotiation strategy.

&gt; This idea that the CDU preferred the Greens in a colation over the SPD is a bit...creative, to say the least.

Oh, is it? Seems like you have forgotten that the CDU was ready to go ahead with the Greens in 2013 already. Even back then, the Grand Coalition was just the second option for the CDU. The talks faltered because Trittin wouldn't agree to a coalition on the CDU terms. Merkel wanted the Greens instead of the SPD back then, because the Greens as a smaller partner are easier to control.

And the Jamaika talks did not fail because the CDU didn't want the Greens in government.

&gt; As an active SPD member for two decades now and I am very much aware of the inner workings of this party. The Seeheimer Kreis is not an all poweful cabal making descisions within the party.

They dominate the party since more than two decades now. They are dominant in the parliamentary group and the upper circles of the party – which is why nearly the entire party establishment supported Scholz, a devoted Seeheimer.

Seems to me like you are a little Betriebsblind.

&gt; And I may also remind you that the SPD had a party member vote on the coalition treaty which was in favor by nearly 70 percent. So seriously, shove your conspiracy theories whereever you want, but not down at my feet.

Wow, what a surprise – a bunch of senior citizens chose the ""status quo"" option when pressured to do so. Because it is the ""responsible thing"" to do. Why do you think everyone was so surprised that NoWaBo and Esken won?

Also, which conspiracy theories? It was very obvious that people like Kahrs advocated for the Grand coalition as soon as Jamaica failed. He did it publicly! And he leads the Seeheimer group.

&gt; All people who massivly lost influence recently, which you must have somehow missed in your anti SPD rants.

I don't see where Kahrs lost much influence. Scholz is still Vizekanzler. The Seeheimers are very much still in control of many things. Which is why the SPD is still in the Grand Coalition right now. It remains to be seen which side will triumph in the end.

For you to understand your biases you need to read the article carefully and understand and find the basis for their reasoning (and conclusions), i.e., that the US can learn much from Finland about gender-equality. They even clearly state and support with numbers *why* they think gender-equality is better for society (with particular emphasis on the US.)

As part of reconstructing Budapest's Royal Palace to its pre-war glory, one of the first elements of the huge project was the reconstruction of the Royal Stables. Designed by Hungarian architect Alajos Hauszmann of New York Café fame, and used as the Royal Stables from the end of the 19th century, the building, along with neighbouring sites around Buda Castle, was seriously damaged during World War II. A decade after the war ended, the incoming Communist government chose to rigorously modernise all Buda Castle landmarks, considered a symbol of the previous regime. However, they gutted and destroyed the former palace and its adjacent structures, including the Royal Stables and the guardhouse, two sites that are now being rebuilt. 

Overseen by award-winning architect and art historian Ferenc Potzner, these long-abandoned landmarks should soon be revived to grace this most historic area of modern-day Budapest. Potzner’s name is linked to such major makeovers as the recently restored Várkert Bazaar and the Sándor Palace, official residence of Hungary’s president, atop the venerable funicular.

According to plans, this ongoing reconstruction follows the original documentation by Hauszmann, for the most part to ensure that these buildings resemble their original style. The wrought-iron railings, the stairway, the doors, windows and the roof are being constructed using the same materials as those of a century or more ago. Meanwhile, a new ferroconcrete structure ensures that each complies with modern-day standards.

Renovation should be completed before the end of this year, when the Royal Stables are to reopen as an events venue, hosting balls, art fairs and festivals. And, as per the building’s original function, they should very likely still house horses, more than a dozen at a time, and serve as a base for a ceremonial cavalry regiment.",Transylvania,/r/europe/comments/ean24x/rebuilt_royal_stable_in_budapest_castle/faue6zc/,hatsek,1576347200

To me, if you have hundreds of people (like the ones from bivol, projopiev’s news outlets looking for a Kompromat on you and all they find is something that has happened in 2007, it would be remarkable - especially in Bulgaria where every second person has broken the law in the 20-30 years of “prehod”.

I don't necessarily recommend Karlovac to a newlywed couple. I was last there with friends in my 20's and my valuing it is mostly due to personal experiences there. It's a very calm city (tourists don't generally go there and locals go on holiday), the people are extremely nice, they have a great city beach there, nightlife was quantitatively non-existent but qualitatively very nice. In short, it's small, quiet, cosy, personable, but it lacks the wow-factor that you'd want if you're looking for specific places to amaze you. You could definitely stop by for a lunch, but you won't take anything from the feeling I described with you so if there's an alternative wow-place nearby I'd favour it.

I have been to islands, but not to Trogir nor Vis. Vis seems like a great choice for the nature of your holiday, but I can't back it up with experience. Looking at pictures, Trogir feels quite like Split. The water-side promenade looks almost identical to that of Split. Not a surprise, considering the vicinity of Split. So you're in danger of doubling the same experience there. On the other side, if that the most southern part of your journey, getting from Vis/Split to Dubrovnik can be quite the boring ride (are you by car?), and personally if I'd be around the Split area, I don't think I'd revisit Dubrovnik.

5927,"&gt;I find the little impact in Class unexpected.

Thatcher made the working classes wealthy - she persuaded them to buy their homes and sold a lot to them at a discount.

Fast forward 40 years and lots of them own their property outright.

So you could look at a place like Grimsby with average income of about £23,000 and think, why are they voting the same way as Beaconsfield, with average income over £100,000?

But when you look at property ownership, you get a different picture:

https://www.ilivehere.co.uk/statistics-grimsby-north-east-lincolnshire-15846.html

30.8% of households in Grimsby own their property outright and 35.3% own with a mortgage. Making it 66.1% of householders being owner occupiers.

In Beaconsfield 86% own their properties (either outright or with mortgage).

So: both places have a majority of property owners, and thus both would be clobbered by Corbyn's policy of lowering the inheritance tax threshold down to £187,000, lower than the price of houses in Grimsby.

So they both voted Tory to preserve their wealth - there is an alliance here across class against the money-grabing socialists.

Whereas the 18-24 year olds are either students, or people who have been working for just a couple of years and they have no assets. For this group who want it all immediately, it seems attractive to vote for Corbyn to get stuff at someone else's expense.

Conclusion: the biggest thing making Britain safe for capitalism is property ownership. The majority have a lot of assets. This is not a poor country.",,/r/europe/comments/eagrsv/uk_election_vote_share_by_demographic/faswmkk/,rose98734,1576332293

I think this copypasta sums up a lot:

Dear Sub-Human Filth,

I'm appealing to all of you stupid idiots to vote Labour in 2019. That is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. I understand the majority of you racist little englanders can't even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family.

We Corybanites are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from Eton, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible.

I don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms.

The religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I'm better than you.

You see, Labour wants a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you.

It's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in the UK when Aboriginals were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big city of London, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do.

All of you stupid, backward, country, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal. If you only understood that you wouldn't be so much worse of a person than I am.

5945,"&gt; And where did I write ""forced""? Moving the goalposts much?

I am not sure if you have read the post you were responding to. Because the discussion was about  the SPD being ""forced"" into a grand coalition.

&gt; Else they would not have waited for Jamaica to fail but moved immidiatly after the elections like the CDU requested at that time.

Sorry, but that is really naive &amp; demonstrates a lack of understanding of the workings of politics.

After the 2017 election, it was clear that people had enough of the grand coalition and neither CDU nor SPD really wanted to continue it. Since the SPD knew that the CDU were trying to create a Jamaica alliance, it was obvious that the SPD would be able to say ""we don't want a coalition"". The SPD fully expected that Jamaica would go through and that another grand coalition was out of the question anyway. In this situation, it is extremely easy to say ""we don't want to continue"" – because the chances of continuing were very small anyway.

The Seeheimer faction that holds the power inside the SPD (or rather held, because NoWaBo/Esken are not part of that faction) of course prefers ruling over opposition – [they have always been open and clear about that](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute/-einfach-nochmal-nachdenken--spd-politiker-kahrs-ueber-groko-100.html). And when Jamaica failed, they only needed to find a good excuse to break the promise about not entering the grand coalition again.

&gt; But they are not quite as opportunistic as they are made out to be.

Its like it is a very broad term that has a lot of ideologies in it. I even mentioned a few less broad terms. Your point is totally irrelevant. Its like saying ""Oh he isnt an animal because what you mean by animal? A wolf? A fish? Or a mosquito?""

Btw what you say is totally irrelevant because i mentioned that both anarchosyndicalism and Orwell's ideas fit into the socialist spectrum.

&gt;So in one sentence you're giving me shit for being ""postmodern"" about definition

That was postmodern as fuck. Didnt say if it is bad or good. Just ironic that JP uses it as a bogyman while doing it all day long with his ""What you mean by X?""

&gt;3 paragraphs down you acknowledge that definitions change and meaning of words changes in different places at different times. 

While you have a point, it is a completely different situation. The term socialism is accepted in political philosophy as it was, while the word libertarian has changed into non state intervention. Wrong imo, but still.

&gt;Only if you define the ""true"" left to be the left you described.

Now you strawman me. I never said that ML were not left. I said Orwell was more left than ML(Marxism Leninism). And his criticism was from the side left of ML. 

&gt;Maybe it's the criticism from the center where center is sensible non-extremist policies? 

Yea, thats why he fought along anarchosyndicalists, a clearly center ideology.

&gt;I see his criticism as an attempt to objectively criticize something that doesn't work and is authoritarian

How can you read Orwell and completely miss the context? Do you want a translation of Animal Farm to see how he is criticizing ML from libertarian socialism?!

&gt;not the criticism ""from the left"" because neither him nor Stalnists can claim ownership of the term left. 

Implying that left is a monolith and that only has one particular ideology and it is not a spectrum where a left can be more right than another left ideology. Just like you did with socialism.... Just dont make the the same mistake again. I will just copy paste this.

And for the nth time. He was more left than ML. He criticized ML from a more left perspective. It was so easy to understand...
