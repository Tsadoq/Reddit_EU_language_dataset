Try to: make maps with better quality, such as vector format.

When you are using light colors that cannot be seen on white background, use some dark color for borders (or the other way around, light color borders for dark text on dark background).

The Poland and Ukraine are barely readable and Vietnamese are not readable at all. And there are weird white pixels around borders (artifact I presume).

You can easily create colored maps with R.

This use ggplot:

First his hotel was bombed, then the parliament, then tanks rushed to the airports in hopes of finding him there but that failed. Multiple jets were flying trying to locate his plane to shoot it down. Oh and soldiers also landed on a stadium and prepared a place to hang erdogan (this was done in past coup also) Their plan was that people would watch from the stadium as they hanged him. 4. They thought they would win because they never expected people to march on the streets. Thats what ruined their plan and thats why the coup fell apart so quickly. And if you want proof of that, there is a video of a gulen member on tv way before the coup saying ""if a coup were to happen today, everyone would hide in their homes, no one would dare to go out to the streets.""

* The US is large and influential and connected.  What Cameroon does and thinks and is can be ignored by most, even if they don't like it.  What the US does is impossible to ignore.

147,"The problems of USSR are mostly over and Russia has a new set of problems. The real problem is the ruling class of the USSR became the ruling class of the Federation. The 90s was violent because they were killing each other to take control. Now a rule is established but it is corrupt. Much of the quality was due to oil prices. Russia needs something more sustainable, the young people are being deprived their future. 

I feel the problem with Russia is the system is hard to change and brutal to those who try to change it. Russia is full of people who can make things better but they are powerless to do and will be crushed if they try to change this. The only way to succeed is to be the most malkavian and brutal person in the system. Putin is very good for a Russian leader because he can bend things to what he wants, but that is part of the problem is it produces leaders like this where all idealism and positivity is stripped away to succeed. 

In many ways the west did fail to Russia. It wasnt intentional but Russia needed help and at the time neoliberalism was prevalent which is a cruel and greedy mindset. Russians were left on their own. It was really a wasted opportunity. 

The main thing that needs to be ended is the hostility and distrust between Russia and NATO countries, and the zero sum relationship. Likely impossible to change this for a decade.

Regarding Trump, I think what needs to be understood is that the US political system has been sort of rotting in the last few decades, and the disenchantment with it as grown to such profound heights, that an outsider presented an opportunity (for many) to throw a grenade into the whole thing. And it especially was prevalent when considering the only other option was someone who belonged to a political dynasty that reflected much of what is wrong with said system.  

I didn't personally vote for him, as he's a bullshit con-artist, but his win is just as much a symptom as it is a problem. The establishment order in the country has failed the people.

161,"Miloš Zeman’s blunt outbursts have long divided Czech opinion. But as his country marks the 50th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Czech president has provoked criticism by deciding to say nothing at all.

On Tuesday the president took no part in commemorations of the events of August 1968, when tanks from the Soviet Union and several other eastern bloc states rolled into Czechoslovakia to crush the “Prague Spring”, an effort to liberalise the local communist system.

The decision has thrown renewed focus on Mr Zeman’s strongly pro-Russian stance, which — at a time when relations between Russia and the west are at their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War — has often set the president at loggerheads with the Czech government, as well as unsettling its western allies.

“I definitely find [the decision not to give a speech] strange,” said Jiří Pehe, director of the New York university in Prague. “This is the 50th anniversary of one of the most tragic events in modern Czech history.”
The 1968 invasion — involving troops from the USSR, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and East Germany — came in response to a series of moves by Czechoslovakia’s then leader, Alexander Dubček, to reform parts of the country’s communist system.

It left scores of Czechs and Slovaks dead and hundreds wounded, and was followed by a crackdown on political dissent that only ended when the 1989 Velvet Revolution brought down the communist regime and ushered in democracy.

Mr Zeman’s spokesman, Jiří Ovčáček, tweeted that Mr Zeman had already shown both his courage and his view of the occupation by opposing it 50 years ago — which led to him being sacked from his job at the time as a university teacher.

“For this attitude he was expelled from work, from the University of Economics. Such a speech is worth more than the thousands of purely formal and insincere speeches that will be heard on 21 August,” Mr Ovčáček tweeted.

“The occupation was a crime. The president’s opinion is the same since 1968. Let us be happy that today we can freely say this truth and we are not being punished by being sacked, as happened to Miloš Zeman.”
Others interpreted Mr Zeman’s move as a sign of his pro-Russian leanings. He has described Moscow’s annexation of Crimea as a “fait accompli” and criticised EU and US sanctions imposed on Russia in response.
Jiří Pospíšil, head of the liberal opposition Top 09 party, wrote an open letter to Mr Zeman, urging him not to “neglect his constitutional duties” despite his “pro-Russian sympathies”.

Mr Pehe said the president’s decision not to give a speech could be an attempt to avoid opponents, or assert control of the political agenda, but that his reluctance to upset Moscow could also have played a role.

“He knows that there is a re-interpretation of communist history taking place in Moscow at the moment,” he said. “If he had said anything, he would have had to be critical, and that would probably have upset Russia.”
In the absence of a speech by Mr Zeman, Czech television was instead due to show a speech by his Slovak counterpart, Andrej Kiska. The Czechs and Slovaks split into two separate countries in 1993, four years after the Velvet Revolution.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/999yok/zeman_silence_on_prague_spring_anniversary/e4m2khq/,FriendOfOrder,1534909039

Slovakia lacked such experience as the major battles were bypassing it. It took 30 years to another generation of revivalists to bring Russia into Panslavic movement. However, K. H. Borovsky after spending some time in Russia in 1840s published rather negative image. This formed the idea of AustroSlavism among Czechs as a real politic over Panslavic idealism. The National Awakening in Czech lands period of 1800-1850 was oriented inward while in Slovakia was looking up outward to Russia.

213,"this isnt some secret court hearing. Maybe in Turkey these are done in secret not in the US. It was thrown out for not having any real evidence, there are professionals who actually make decisions based off the laws and proof and not just people who do what autocrats want. 

And that is a weak argument *we have no proof but if we can get ahold of someone we can torture them and then get the proof.*  You need to have some dirty secrets first to actually extradite someone and not have nothing and say you will get them later. You dont punish someone and say, *ill prove the crime later.* 

So maybe you should help your government out. The whole Turkish government is incapable of showing all this proof you know about. They lack your genius. Other people moving aorund doesnt prove Gulen did anything. I could claim some Turk crossing into China means you are guilty of shooting down MH17, nobody else will believe that. And do you have proof the US knows Gulen is guilty? It sounds like you are taking the Edrogan approach and making the accusation and then pretending that because you said it then it must be true. 

And it is in their best interest to send Gulen. Turkey is a really important NATO member and important NATO ally and is some religious zealot and nutcase. He is nothing but problems. Still the US is based off laws that cant be broken just because their is benefit to do so. It undermines the whole basis of the country. And it isnt the US pushing this, I dont believe any US officials have taken this stance nor have I seen mainstream media take it. Nobody believes Erdogan, it isnt just the US. The only coup was pathetic and shady as hell, and was used to crackdsown on all of his enemies and increase his power. Very convenient for him without being any type of threat.

221,"&gt; Funny how you constantly put labels on people and tell them they are wrong and bad.

It's not a label, it's your classification on the political debate spectrum.

&gt;I do not attack migrants.

Your post history proves otherwise. You also attack NGOs.

&gt;I totally understand why they come here. Does not mean I need to agree with that being allowed in the current way.

I understand that too. The difference is, I don't attack them.

&gt;And I still ask: what is wrong with Malta?

Nothing is wrong with Malta itself, what's wrong is your agenda. I've answered that plenty of times already, but you can't seem to understand that.

&gt;You can't seem to answer that, trying to shift the conversation to ""you are a populist"" to avoid actually giving arguments. Interesting, because that is a classic tactic populist politicians use, the people you say you hate so much.

That has literally nothing to do with populism actually. You still fail to understand what populism is.

&gt;You are displaying the exact behavior why populists are gaining ground. You are more busy with telling people are bad than actually addressing their arguments.

That is not why populists are gaining grounds. They are gaining grounds because the real solutions take longer to come up with and implement, while the magical populist solutions seem a lot easier and faster. ""Just send migrants to Tunisia, even if it's illegal"", ""They did not stop at the first country I think they should have stopped at"" are examples of populism.

236,"You seem very aggressive and inquisitive, am I on trial?

Let me quote you directly the part of the article which mentions the quote :

&gt; Aussi bien certaines personnalités musulmanes ne cachent-elles pas leurs intentions conquérantes en Europe. Tel le cheikh Youssouf al Quaradawi, l'un des principaux de l'UOIE (Union des organisations islamiques européennes, dont la branche française est l'UOIF), qui déclarait en 2002: «Avec vos lois démocratiques nous vous coloniserons. Avec nos lois coraniques nous vous dominerons.»

Translation : 

&gt; Some muslim figures do not hide their conquering intent on Europe. Like sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, one of the higher-up of the FIOE (Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe, which french chapter is UOIF), who declared in 2002 : ""With your democratic laws, we will colonise you. With our Kuranic laws, we will dominate you.""

Now I do not have a primary source, just like I do not have a primary source that Joan of Arc said ""Lets kick the english out of France"" but when it is reported on by the most mainstream press possible in France, a free and democratic country, is freely talked about and never contested by anyone, and that such a quote is completely plausible for such a character as al-Qaradawi, who oppenly supports suicide bombing on civilians, the execution of islamic apostates and homosexuals, the mutilation of female's genitals, forcing women to wear an hijab, wife beating and the flogging of women who have sex outside of marriage and who is the intellectual head of an organisation whose goal is to plundge the whole world into an islamic darkness, I do not see why I should spend hours reading such a madman to find the sacrosanct primary source. Do you honestly do a personal research project on every single claims that you encounter or only those that are in disagreement with your presupposed point of view? Do you have a primary source that human beings evolved from monkeys or that Cleopatra was queen of Egypt for example?

Also I am not an ex-muslim and never have I claimed so, where did you get that idea? I post almost exclusively about Islam and immigration as I came to realise that those are probably the single greatest threats to Europe and our western way of life that I enjoy very much so as a freethinking lesbian woman. But I do not spend my entire time on reddit, dont worry I have other things in my life.

Do you need anything else?

Edit : Anyway I used that quote only as a way to illustrate the point of the other person that I responded to.

Firstly you havent shown any proof. You even make it seem like you are uncertain if the coup was real or not but lean slightly more to it being real. And anyway we arent discussing if the coup was real or fake, we are discussing if Turkey can prove Gulen, the individuals involvement. I think you are confusing the person with the organization. You have shown no proof other than saying *members fled after Erdogan used the coup as an excuse to crack down on them and arrest them on mass.* Yeah no shit. Regardless if the coup was real or not you would flee too. Either way it doesnt prove that the guy Gulen had any involvement and the US cannot extradite them. That is reality. Even if Turkey could bribe a judge he could appeal and go to another judge. Turkey would have to bribe the entire US justice system to illegal extradite him without being caught.

261,"&gt; Why would they have nuclear weapons if they had no intention of using them? They killed 3.5 million Japanese in word war

First, the atomic weapons [killed about 130k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) people.  I don't see what the total war mortality has to do with the matter.

Second, Wikipedia's high end estimate for total war mortality in Japan, military and civilian, is 3.1 million.

And that's war.  The US didn't ask to be attacked.  If you're going to complain about, say, strategic bombing or sinking merchant shipping to try to cut off food supply, Germany did both against the UK prior to the US doing so.  Germany was working on her own atomic weapons, and would certainly have used them herself, given the opportunity.

Third, when Japan attacks the US because the US is blocking Imperial Japan from prosecuting a war in China intended to  establish an *actual* empire, complaining that this is ""imperialist"" seems like quite a stretch.

And fourth, the US has never said that it has no intention of using nuclear weapons.  Quite the opposite, in fact.

278,"""Link tax"" is a populist term, for sure. It's obviously not a tax, but a licensing requirement. And it's not on links themselves, but on extracts ... including tiny snippets, such as those that normally accompany links.

That's why Julia Reda uses the term in quotes (most of the time) and only as a sort of headline that gives people a rough idea what this is about, before going into [much, much deeper detail](https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/extra-copyright-for-news-sites/).

However, squabbling over the label doesn't change that it will, indeed make linking [with snippets] to news content require licensing in many cases. You have neglected to debunk the detailed and specific arguments how it will have that effect, [e.g. made here analyzing the Parliament's legal draft sentence by sentence](https://juliareda.eu/2018/06/article-11-13-vote/).

Europe's leading copyright academics – 169 of them! – disagree with your assessment that the proposal won't lead to fundamental changes:

&gt; ""Permissions would need to be sought for virtually any use. Even using the smallest part of a press publication (except perhaps for strictly private use) would mean payment would be due to an institutional news publisher.""
https://www.ivir.nl/academics-against-press-publishers-right/

*

It's not trivial to estimate what exact effects a draft legal text will have in practice.

Laws aren't algorithms. Legal terms may have non-obvious meanings. They are interpreted by courts, where the specifics of a case and precedent play a role, not just the letter of the law. In the case of EU directives they will even first be transcribed into national law (in 28 subtly different ways). Additionally, legal uncertainty causes over-compliance with the letter of the law in practice: The threat of losing a lawsuit, and just the cost of even having to fight one in the first place to clearly define what's allowed and what not makes people err on the safe side. 

All of this means that average citizen skimming a legal draft in a field they're unfamiliar with will many times lack the contextual knowledge required to estimate what exact effect this will have in practice. 

It's why we pay legal scholars, advisors and others working in Parliaments to do that job. Expecting the same skillset from every voter is asking too much.

That's not to give the impression I don't believe in full transparency and accessability of a Parliament's work – but I don't (anymore) in trying to crowdsource it.

*

It's one job of politicians to estimate these effects, and to inform their constituents of them in understandable terms.

Of course they do so through an ideological lens. A politician believing in the importance of a free and open internet will over-focus on the risk a legal draft may pose to that. Another believing that we must above all protect big European industry and the internet is primarily a big marketplace will be inclined to downplay it. That's what they're elected to do. If they think ""the chance of catastrophic impact on my constituents' interests is less than 100%, so I'll keep quiet"" they're not doing their job.

Political communication to the broad public necessarily has to simplify complex matters. Especially at the EU level, no-one is paying attention to the lawmaking process. If you think it's necessary that they do, you must get their attention and speak in ways they intuitively understand. No doubt, something will always get lost in that process. The challenge is to achieve this without misrepresenting what you honestly and after consultation with experts believe to be the truth.

*

I challenge you to find even one single other Member of the European Parliament – or heck, anywhere! – who puts as much effort as Julia Reda does into [explaining the legislative process](https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/) and [breaking down the letter of legal drafts](https://juliareda.eu/2018/06/article-11-13-vote/).

It is absolutely unheard-of! For every other law currently making its way through the EU, all of this happens behind closed doors and is entirely impenetrable. Most MEPs just toss little quotes to the public in press releases that are way, way, waaaay further off the mark than the term ""link tax"".

*

In summary, I think your skepticism and contrarianism is tragically misdirected at those few people in politics actually fighting for your rights as an internet user, who have broad academic consensus backing up their statements, and who may be finding themselves forced to be a bit populist now and then in an effort to overcome a system stacked massively against them.

On the side you're effectively defending are politicians with deep ties to big business lobbies, hardly any technical understanding and ten times more populist messaging. They've unmistakably stated from the very start that [the purpose of this law is to transfer money from online platforms to the EU publishing industry to make up for lost newspaper sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jta92bxjMDw), have advised publishers to instruct their journalists [not to report negatively on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxz9X_6Zvqc), demonstrated time and time again a [very shallow understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx2b0ZXhJus) [of the issues](https://www.axel-voss-europa.de/2018/07/03/standpunkt-urheberrecht/), etc. etc.

One reason you're not debunking *them* here is because they don't even bother communicating to you, preferring the process to go on behind closed doors and without your involvement.

The term ""link tax"" is decidedly not the problem here.

I just did I got them  mostly from Ducelliers : Les Albanais sont-ils des envahisseurs au Kosovo? and Noel Malcolms Origins of Serbs Albanians and Vlachs. They are both online though the first one is translated from french which is why it has distorted names :

The others are paragraphs from the sources above though they are much longer than the 2 above.

&gt;Albanians were present, but nowhere near the majority until the Ottomans came.

I never claimed Albanians were the majority. You said Albanians came here through the Ottomans and now you state that in fact albanians were there with Serbs from the beginning. It is stated that the Serbian people lived in the lowlands of Kosovo, whilst the Albanian people in its mountain regions. Therefore when the turks came the Serbian people escaped whereas the Albanian ones remained in the mountains and then came down to find empty fields and valleys.

&gt;Albanians migrated to north Albania and Kosovo with the Ottomans, that's the whole point, they came there under occupation.

I cannot emphasize this particular paragraph enough: 

**The defeat of 1389 totally disorganized the Serbian state and left a free field of action to the most powerful local princes, including the Albanian princes of the North and the Northeast. The most distinguished among them was Gjon KASTRIOTI, who, from an original ruler of the mountainous region of Mat, extended his principality from the mouth of the Ishem River up to Prizren, in the South of Kosovo. In 1420 he granted Ragusa a trade privilege from ""his coastal lands up to Prizren [19]"".**

The Serbian Kingdom fought a battle that lost its control of the region. Said region became empty either due to war/famine or due to   migrations. Albanians remained there and multiplied. They were not payed by the Ottomans, they merely took advantage of a situation for a  region that was now empty and rich in resources.

&gt; The USSR became a world power and no person ever hungered again there after 1945.

Nice of you to include the ""after 1945"". That ukrainian famine didn't really count, did it. 

The long lines for every day foods such as bread were a thing up until the dissolution of soviet union. People had to wait for several hours, and food was very scarce. And that's in Czech republic, which one of the most developed satellite states. And we didn't have this problem before communists came. Yay, progress! And you must be really naive to trust soviet propaganda. Which brings me to my next point: 

&gt; Cuba is the first country to have 0% homeless children.

They also had ""no free trade"". Yet everyone in Cuba knew about the black market, and worked odd jobs on the side. You know, to get money for food. Strange, huh. And Cuba recently made it legal, which means even communists know communism doesn't work. (even China realized this) So you see, capitalism isn't something that needs to be forced, it grows organically. People choose it themselves.

Communism=USSR=bad?

No, communism = USSR, China, Cuba, North Korea, few south american countries trying ""light"" versions like Venezuela

Notice a common theme? All of them either disbanded central planning, or failed, and all of them oppressed their people. Communism just doesn't work and always turns out the same.

Few other points: Of course ends don't justify the means, the point was that it was a political decision that had nothing to do with capitalism. I'd say most of them have recovered, but it is up to discussion. Venezuela very much resembles a socialist country and helps my point - if you can't even successfully govern such a light version of socialism, how could you sustain a ""real"" one? And what else could you export? Let's be honest, Guatemala doesn't have much to offer besides bananas and coffee. Cheap labor is better than no labor.

Indicting enablers on our side primarily. It may be a long con, but I don't see a better alternative. If you have one, I'm all ears.   


&gt;I agree with this to some extent, but we are bringing their issues into the Union as well, see Greece for example.

I don't agree with the stance, I do believe that taking up especially the weaker countries of Europe can be very beneficial. Poland went from net emigration and weak economy to net immigration and a very stable growing economy. Greece is struggling, but It has had a period of great growth. Between 2000 and 2008 the GDP nearly tripped and now it is resting at double the value of 2000. Now we can discuss what went wrong, how to evade that, how to stabilize etc. But if the west Balkans and Ukraine joined it would add 181billion to the GDP, which is more than Poland in 2000 (2000: 171.9, 2016: 469.5) or approx 1 Czech republic now. Assuming a conservative doubling over 10years it would add another Czech republic or a Romania. Not to mention other economic multipliers from standardization, stimulus programs, division of labour, know how etc. A while back I spent a lot of time over plots of the economy and noticed that whilst there are global trends and points of reference (2008 for example), but arguably growth in Europe has been in lockstep for the last few decades and what more I calculated (no real proof just estimates), that adjusted against the global growth rate in the 5y after a EU accession GDP/capita had above average growth in the whole EU and the new nation especially.  I believe that Europe should come together and stand fast.

571,"No. The reason such incidences are covered up is for PR reasons, as well of loss of personnel in dioceses. 

This isn't the Vatican protecting these rapists for the sake of protecting the practice of raping children for their own sexual pleasure. To claim this implies that the Church would risk legal prosecution for the sake of allowing a minority of priests and clergymen to continue their sick work. The vast majority of priests are not rapists. This is all about public reputation, personnel and management, as well as fearing public outrage. The Vatican is not a ring of child rapists who've all got each others' backs. 

Most of these incidents occur with homosexual priests. I think that the Vatican should publicly address its shameless covering up of such incidents, followed by an overhaul in management.  Finally, to prevent such incidents from occurring, the Church should absolutely stop ordaining homosexual priests. The 'interview' process should be stricter and more selective. Problem is that being a priest isn't exactly a sought after occupation, so the old Archbishops likely take whoever they can get. This makes it very easy for pedophiles and or gay/straight men to join the priesthood, where they can act on their bad intentions. I will agree that the way the Vatican has addressed the issue is improper, shameless––a shot in the foot.",,/r/europe/comments/98t80d/catholic_church_policy/e4l635d/,Majkus13,1534878596
572,"The fact that you use Wikipedia as an information source explains why you are so ignorant to put it mildly. Wikipedia is the most unreliable source of information. There is tons of material on this topic, which i am not going to go into, and you don't seem to be interested in independent thinking. 

As for ''Slavic'', do your own research, other than relying on what is written on Wikipedia. Slavic people are not an ethnic or cultural group, that doesn't even make any logical sense no matter from which angle you look at it,  Germanic people are not ethnic or cultural group, Romance people are neither. Slavic is a language family spoken by many ethnic groups with different cultures, traditions and identities, as well as genetic makeups. Russia alone is composed of many ethnic and cultural groups, same for Bulgaria -- my country, and so on. 

Just last year i read yet another scientific research on the genetic composition of modern day Russians, which showed that majority of the Russians living in the European part have the same genetic make-up as the Finno-Ugric people, or Finnish people. 

It's ironic you feel so confident in your opinions on this topic, yet your entire source of information comes from Wikipedia. 

As for the second part of your comment, even if we assume what you are saying is true, why are you applying it only to Slavic speakers, and not Romance or Germanic speakers? If a Slavic speaker doesn't speak English, it means he isn't contributing to the world, but if a Germanic speaker or a Romance speaker doesn't speak English, they are contributing to the world? If not, why did you not mention them but only focus on the Slavic speakers? Double standards and simple mindedness is usually what all bigoted and ignorant people have in common.

It doesn't work in most of Latin America, Africa and Asia. An economic System in which there is so much hunger, poverty and suffering doesn't work.

The USSR became a world power and no person ever hungered again there after 1945.
Cuba is the first country to have 0% homeless children. Socialism also worked perfectly in Yugoslavia. Even if they didn't work, they at least made the social democratic movements happen and those work in many European countries.

I just said that because the comment  above used the same logic Communism=USSR=bad.

597,"Nazis **were not socialists** in the conventional political sense (as they were uninterested in seizing the means of production or the abolition of private property) but they wanted a re-definition of the term ""socialism."" They wanted a new ""socialism"" completely divorced from Marxism that emphasized certain aspect of a communal society, without the destruction of hierarchy and private property (that never succeeds in actual left-socialists states anyways).  

But I don't think you can really understand Nazis (National Socialists) without understanding **their conception of socialism**. It's obviously a terminology ripe for misunderstanding and flagrant mislabeling for political ends, but it something that should be understood to truly get fascism.

It is all about Prague spring. Which is correct though, but it does not do justice in terms of whole country. Czechoslovakia was made up of five main nationalities_ Czechs, Moravians, Slovaks Hungarians and Ruthenians. Have You heard about Ruthenians whom died  during the occupaton in Košice?   Yet, the were there.   
Here in Slovakia, we use to talk about how the hell we became socialistic, because whole country since 19th century was very much in right side of spectrum. There are jokes about how comunism made its way to Slovakia from west, which is actually true. Notheless, my point is,  You might be exposed to news about Czech Republic more, than to news about Slovakia, because we are far less well known.   
Just a reminder- there is speach of Slovak president in Czech national TV today, instead of Czech one, because the Mr. Zeman seems to be quite Ok with terms of current Russian foreign policy.

With no allies nearby and germany in the other side of the country Romania complied and gave it to avoid a fate like poland. In the next few weeks they were forced to give northern translivania to hungary and south dobrogea to Bulgaria. All these territorial loses led to the abolition of the king and rise of the fascists to power (with help from germany). The fascists mainly reached power with the promise that they would recover basarabia and escape the communist idelogy that was looming for quite some time. Since the other regions where ceded to fascist countries there was no real subject there. Romania was not the only one forced into this situation, the good old saviors of europe attacked finland and poland too. Of course what i am going to say next is a matter of what if but think about it this way. What if the soviets didn;t invade poland romania and finland ? How far could the Nazis have gotten into the USSR ? Sure all 3 countries would have been defeated, but those additional wars would have cost time and resources.

I have also included stations that, although not being European, are close to Europe and have been heard here for decades. Curiously, [the strongest AM station of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kossuth_R%C3%A1di%C3%B3) is not listenable here.

The stations are the following:

**FM**: RDS, Radio Globo, RTL 102.5 (Italy)

**LW**: Medi1 (Morocco), RMC, Europe 1 (France), RTL (Luxembourg/France), BBC Radio 4 (England), Chaîne 1 (Algeria)

**MW**: RAI Radio 1 (Italy), BBC Radio 5 (England), Manx Radio (Isle of Man), BBC Radio Ulster (Northern Ireland), Groot Nieuws Radio (Netherlands)

**SW**: BBC World Service (England), Radio Romania International (Romania), Voice of Turkey (Turkey)

The gear used is nothing fancy, just [a Panasonic RF-3500 with a Tecsun loop antenna](https://i.imgur.com/i7BgtqL.jpg) for AM listening and no additional antenna for the other bands.

There are also lots of non-european stations transmitting in shortwave, like, for example, the Voice of America, China Radio International, Radio Marti (anticommunist propaganda aimed at Cuba), the Voice of Korea and lots of religious and conspiracy stations coming from America.

Also, a lot more French stations could be heard here on the AM band, like France Info and different regional stations, until France decided to stop AM transmissions :-(",,/r/europe/comments/993tvf/foreign_radio_stations_that_can_be_heard_in_ibiza/e4knurg/,UruguayanRedditor,1534863389

745,"I think some academic resources would help solidify your position a bit. We can look at whether Iraq or Afghanistan had a role in 9/11 through a historical/analytical lens 17 years after the US invasion (of Afghanistan) rather than opinions formed at the time. I believe that we can also look at Afghanistan’s role starting all the way back to the Soviet invasion. Claiming that Afghanistan played no role in the 9/11 attacks is misleading for several reasons: 1) It is important to address the non-state actors question, but in the case of severe events, nation states behave on nation state levels. What could the US do executively in reaction to 9/11? Expect big moves. Henry Kissinger’s Diplomacy covers this in the lead up to WWI 2) Non-state actors are very often influenced/supported by states, but the degree of deniability will lead to conflicting opinions: how to react, to what extent. RAND’s [“Trends in Outside Support for Insurgent Movements”](https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1405.html)
I agree that the reasons for invading Iraq were weak. It had very limited role in 9/11, but have to emphatically disagree with the “no role” comment regarding Afghanistan.

820,"&gt;It was purposefully starving people no matter how hard you try to rewrite history.

Try to argue that with the mainstream of liberal and conservative historians, not me. The myth of the Holodomor originated with the NSDAP newspaper ""Der Stürmer"" with the article ""Muss Russland Hungern"" which was republished under a different name in the Oxford Journal years later. I mean, if you base your historical knowledge on Goebbels, that's your thing.

&gt;So you are saying, even though they were corrupt and people were not equal and law did not apply to everyone equally, it doesn't matter, because some countries are richer than others so it does not matter that after thank God CCCP crashed, people became more equal in all of former eastern block countries, especially V4.

Gibberish. I'm not talking about the average wealth of countries. I'm talking about the fact that 50% of the planet's wealth us owned by the 1%, whereas this wasn't the case in the USSR. A manager of a plant was still responsible to the workers and was removed by the CPSU when corrupt. Also, there were direct democratic measures, which can still be observed in Cuba. Your second statement is also objectively wrong. In Russia, the GINI coefficient worsened, inequality skyrocketed, so I do not know what you are talking about. In 1994, Yelzin fired on the Supreme Soviet with tanks to seize authoritarian power. Literally the first time riot police had to be deployed, something that never happened in Soviet history.

&gt;The centrally planned economy was to the benefit of the CCCP. 

In capitalism, the law of value regulates the economy. The commonly planned economy, conducted by the GOSPLAN with over 5000 people was supposed to benefit the people and objectively contribute to the economic and human development. The rest is also wrong. The USSR didn't ""exploit"" other socialist countries. In fact, they invested more into them than they got out of it. Even with China. 

&gt;Occupation of czechoslovakia, for example, nuclear testing above populated areas, people sent to gulags, starvation.

Intervention in Czechoslovakia could have handled better. Americans tested nukes as well and ruined the enviromental. Gulags were just prisons with labor, and were abolished in 1956. Many western states kept worse prisons till today. More Americans are in prisons with labor than during the peak of Stalin's reign. ""Starvation"" is a meme. USSR ended starvation and had a higher calorie intake than the US according to CIA sources.

&gt;Most people were not
 
They were. More than 58% of applications to travel into the West were granted. You are lying.

&gt;Palij, who was never a German citizen, emigrated to the US as a war refugee in 1949 and became a naturalized citizen in 1957. But in 2003, a federal judge in New York stripped him of his citizenship on the grounds that he had concealed his service at an SS slave-labor camp. [...]

Following your logic, import or anti-dumping taxes are also stealing from your own citizens. Yet even more sectors would be overrun by cheap Chinese produce if not those taxes.

Of course, Greece situation was caused by other issues. But they may have rebounded quicker if they had such option. Now they couldn't do true devaluation and internal devaluation was hardly possible because of strong unions and whatnot.

Meanwhile here in Baltic states we did so-called internal devaluation. Pretty much everybody had their salaries cut. That helped to balance pre-crises real estate bubble in no time. Sure, some people got the very short end of the stick. But overall we rebounded very quickly. Of course, some people are salty about salary cuts. But when the option was either massive layoffs or smaller layoffs and salary cuts.. I'm sure the later was better option in long term. But that wouldn't have worked if we had stubborn worker unions. Then true devaluation is probably the only solution.

While devaluation is a very complex topic, ""fucking over your own population"" is very short sighted. 

Also, cheap loans is not always good. I'd argue that one of the reasons why Greece is that fucked is cheap loans. They took out so many of them thanks to Euro, but state of their economy didn't match it. Thus they crumbled at first sight of downtown.

948,"The article throws a lot of things together to come to its conclusion, some of which directly contradict each other.

&gt;Sweden’s rapid intake of huge numbers of refugees and migrants, **about 600,000 in total** over the past five years,  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m worried about the lack of incentives \[to work\] in the Swedish welfare state, but I’m not worried **about the 250,000 refugees that have arrived**.”

That is a large difference. And in a recent topic people said it was actually even less. Where are these numbers coming from?

&gt;In recent years, Sweden has granted thousands of work permits to information technology developers, berry pickers, and cooks. Foreign-born workers accounted for all the job growth in the industrial sector last year and for 90 percent of the new jobs in the welfare sector, in particular health care and elderly care.

Are these the refugees that came in, are these Eastern Europeans moving in, or maybe from Asia or South America? Poland's economy is also going well and is attracting immigrants, but they did not take in people in the way Sweden did. And later in the article it mentions migrants have trouble getting jobs, implying it is because of racism. So a lot of them can't get a job, but then they are responsible for job growth?

&gt;Sweden’s rapid intake of huge numbers of refugees and migrants, about 600,000 in total over the past five years, **has produced some of the highest growth rates in Europe and will also help it address the challenges of an otherwise aging population.**  
&gt;  
&gt;A recent report from the Expert Group on Public Economics, an independent committee within the Finance Ministry, added fuel to the fire by estimating **the net cost to public finances from the most recent refugees to be 74,000 kronor ($8,000) per person annually over a lifetime.**

The article draws the conclusion that this number of migrants is the reason for growth, but the government is saying they cost money every year in their whole live. So the growth is then coming from the government dept going up and that money going into the economy? That is not sustainable.

The people mentioned in the article are doing a good job and they should be more than welcome, contributing to the country. But articles like this always seem to just throw some numbers together and draw a conclusion that can not be made from the conflicting information given.",,/r/europe/comments/99236g/swedens_economy_is_getting_a_lift_from_migrants/e4kby99/,cissoniuss,1534849203

The Royal Navy blockaded Germany from September 1939 onward.  The lack of imported food and oil contributed to the logistical problems that ultimately stopped Operation Barbarossa.

The first British aid convoy to the USSR was dispatched in June 1941, a few weeks after Germany invaded.  Over the course of the war, the British sent more than 7,000 aircraft and 17,000 vehicles to the USSR, in addition to more basic items like 15 million pairs of boots.  That's in addition to the American Lend-Lease aid - and don't forget that both the British and American convoys were escorted primarily by the Royal Navy, as the US Navy was busy in the Pacific.

Russia *might* have been able to stop Germany without American help.  It *certainly* could not have done so without British help.

962,"Their external debt to GDP is 70%, not 120%. That's a first.
Secondly, their inflation is high but not unmanagable. Israel had inflation of over 480% in the 1980s.  Turkey's inflation in the high teens, by comparison, is far milder.

This is why I said this is essentially a political crisis. Erdogan can end it quickly by allowing the interest rates to rise to their approprite level, which would happened had the central bank been independent which it manifestly is not. Ergo, that's why any bailout without deeper political change would not work. On the other hand, blatantly removing Erdogan (such as via a new coup) would not grant legitimacy to any new structural programme and would rightly be seen as a colonial interference. This is why the situation is complex.

The best course of action is to wait as the crisis slowly burns through their defences and then let the IMF come in. If Erdogan would refuse by that point as well, then somekind of direct interference would become necessary, or else we'd get another Venezuela on our shores. But I don't think it will ever come to that.

967,"Jokes aside, from a technical point of view, all actions the Spanish government took to avoid the Catalan referendum are quite interesting.

The Spanish government shut down more than 100 websites in few days, some owned by the Catalan government but most owned by private people and institutions like [ANC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblea_Nacional_Catalana) (the biggest pro-independence organization). Some consider it the biggest case of digital censorship in the EU history.

They shut down those websites in very different ways, from using ISP's to block the traffic to sending the police officers to server companies to close the website. Spanish police even went to Google offices to force them remove an app from Google Play which contained information about polling stations.

During the day of the referendum, they attacked the website that was responsible for validating the votes during all day.

990,"What I'm trying to get at here, but kind of failing at showing properly is that all Art (the ones that have entered public conscious at least) has been scandalous and flying in the face of public Norms and Tastes.

It's hard for us to *really* grasp that, because a lot of those norms simply seem ludicrous to us at this point of time. It's hard to really *get* the absolute horror and astonishment that audiences felt.

A good example is Manet's [Olympia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_(Manet\)). Up until this painting women had been depicted as an object of the male Gaze, up there on a canvas to be seen, admired, a source of innocence, life, inspiration. Just look at Ingres' [The Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Source_(Ingres\)). Look at that beauty. Look at her voluptuous figure. 

However, you might have noticed how among those things listed there doesn't to be a whole lot for the woman to do, besides be servile to others. She always gives and receives. Never takes. Take another look at Ingres' [The Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Source_(Ingres\)#/media/File:Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres_-_The_Spring_-_Google_Art_Project_2.jpg). Look at that empty expression. All of that changed with [Olympia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Edouard_Manet_-_Olympia_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg). For the first time, the woman looked back; took ownership of her sexuality; provoked you with her gaze; you see me, I see you. Gone were the days of the supposed Goddess of Sex [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Anadyomene) covering herself. This woman did not lower her gaze, letting others feast upon her with her eyes. She stared back, straight into your eyes.

This shocked and shook the French audience. I'll let the wikipedia  article speak for me:
&gt; ""Though Manet's Le déjeuner sur l'herbe sparked controversy in 1863, his Olympia stirred an even bigger uproar when it was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon. Conservatives condemned the work as ""immoral"" and ""vulgar."" Journalist Antonin Proust later recalled, ""**If the canvas of the Olympia was not destroyed, it is only because of the precautions that were taken by the administration**."" The critics and the public condemned the work alike. Even Émile Zola was reduced to disingenuously commenting on the work's formal qualities rather than acknowledging the subject matter, ""You wanted a nude, and you chose Olympia, the first that came along"".

--- 
Now you might ask yourself where am I going with this. Well, as can be argued, Art is primarily about challenging the status quo and in our day and age in Bulgaria, it is about standing up to those who trampled us with their boots and the lasting effects of whose legacy can still be felt to this day. What better way to make Art than doing away with what failed us before and led to our suffering?

Unfortunately what we now have in most of Europe is something fairly unique and unprecedental. It's not something that is some logical development that everyone will eventually come to at some point. It's not that some countries just lag behind and have not arrived to the 21st century.

In the world context, we are the weird ones here in how we do approach intra-alliance relations, it's not really Russia being the weird one. What happened in W-Europe post-WW2 happened in unique circumstances. If those circumstances were different, it's very well possible that they would not have 'arrived in the 21st century' either.

The circumstances are partly gone, luckily in the meantime people realized that they created a really good framework for the co-existence in Europe and so so far they decided to stick with it. Hopefully it will last as long as possible. But I would really not bet all my money on it.

1039,"&gt; It's a null-argument as they were equally evil.

Oh fuck you you Holocaust trivializing piece of shit.

&gt; It's fundamentally wrong to defend the Soviets.

No. You see, there's these things called ""nuance"" and ""context"". I have great sympathies for even the harshest anarchist criticisms of the Soviet Union for instance, but naive whiney self-centered Eastern European nationalists with no regard for the scope of Nazi Germany's crimes should honestly all be put into re-education camps. (Really, any education would do you good.)

&gt; My hatred for the Soviet Union is educated and rational, your delusional love for it however is due to you being an uneducated brainwashed person.

Oh shut up. I have a realistic assessment of the relative evils of Nazi Germany and the USSR, but I suppose that would seem like brainwashing to someone brought up on a steady diet of ""both-sides-are-the-same"" centrist nonsense.

&gt; What makes you think you need to love your nation to be a xenophobe?

Okay, fair enough. At any rate, my initial point still stands:

""I'm not xenophobic, I hate the very concept of nationhood itself and would like to see any and all nation states on the trash heap of history, including the one that claims me as its own.""

Now to be fair, there are some nations I hate more than others, and nations that have a particular history of standing in the way of socialism are at the very top of my shit list. This hatred doesn't stem from a fear of the foreign (why, I would unironically accept every single refugee on the entire planet in my quaint little home country of Austria just for the lulz) but from the basic axiom that anything that serves humanity's liberation from the chains of capitalism is good and anything that hinders it is evil.

&gt; They were never cease to exist as long as there is a decent part of the same population living in each territory.

But they've only been existing for a few centuries to begin with! Why would they suddenly remain indefinitely?

&gt; Between these invasions Russia was still independent, unlike countries that were constantly occupied.

What really is independence anyway? The nascent Soviet Union was pretty reliant on foreign capital investments and imports. There is no such thing as independence, all of humanity has been interconnected for at least two centuries.

&gt; Absolutely true, but they could progress by stealing from their neighbours as they usually do.

I made up an article, that you could put on the site but you can review from in your perspective, if you like.

Look here
---------
Title:
Remember when Obama was forced to produce his ""so-called"" birth certificate on the White House website? This is bigger. It's that Obama's real name is Barry Parks, born in Topeka, Kansas!!!!
-----
Donald Trump very rightly takes credit for forcing Obama to produce his phony birth certificate on the White House website.

But the plot gets really interesting from here on. So listen:

I happened upon a lady on Internet who's very actively spreading the news that she witnessed Obama's birth in Topeka, Kansas.  She says she's Linda Joy Adams, Obama's cousin. See her blog where one can contact her and ask anything, if one has doubts about what she says.

Obama's real name is Barry Parks, she says. 

Now I want to pose a common-sense question to everybody so you can answer me as if I was dumb and asking ugly questions: ""Why is no one asking about Obama's Kansas family, seeing it's well-known that Obama's mother was born in Kansas? Are the birthers asking crazy questions about Hawaii and Kenya just simply to distract from the reality in Kansas?"" That's namely what Linda Joy Adams is saying. A sign that's suspicious is that she's panicking the Establishment and that the birthers are running for cover about her.
Indeed lead Commander of Joe Arpaio's birther Cold Case Posse, contacted Linda Adams and ran the information she provided through his cop-computer. When he got back to her he said that Obama's grandfather was a CIA stooge so he couldn't extend his research on him and had to stop in his tracks. 

So the lead went dead after that and that story about Obama's Barry Parks name is a lead the birthers now won't touch even with a ten-foot pole.

We have to contact Linda Joy Adams (http://lindajoyadams.blogspot.com/)  and do the research about all the facts she provides about Obama's real identity.
We don't know who the man using the name Barack Obama really is and it's urgent for the USA's and the world's survival that we get to know what he is.",,/r/europe/comments/980ojo/internet_browsing_experience_has_been_absolutely/e4k8ngl/,Dujikorlo,1534842631

Sort of, the exchange rate of DMark into Euro was ~2.00, but the (then) US$-DMark exchange rate of ~3.00 is now replaced with (current) US$-EUR exchange rate of ~1.10.      
On a global scale the value of the US$ has devaluated by ~40% and is a lot cheaper then it used to be.

1146,"Germany only learnt how to cooperate after the country was crushed to the ground after WW2, their leadership executed and their new institutions and constitution set up for them. The rest of the Western Europe cooperated with them in the light of the Soviet threat looming behind the horizon. It literaly took a genocidial world war and and two emerging world powers - one being a threat and the other a protector who also functioned as a supporter of the said cooperation for the Western Europe to start the cooperation.

Russians on the other hand were not defeated after the end of CW the same way Germans or Japanese were. From the perspective of the ordinary people, their attempts at democratizing and cooperating with the West left them in a state of lawlessness, where  a few dozens oligarchs were stealing everything while the less fortunate people had troubles to even feed their family.

At the same time, there wasn't any foreign power there capable of ramming into their heads that their ideology was wrong, the way they organize their society is wrong and the way the behave towards other countries is wrong. And there wasn't any foreign power making sure when they try to reform it won't end disastrously for the common people. Instead it was Putin who stepped in and restored some sense of order.

So in a way, I actually do get how Russians think that cooperating with the West is not the way to go. Of course even if I do have some sort of understanding, it doesn't change the fact they are a threat to us. You can simultaniously have some understanding for the logic and reasoning of your enemy while knowing that it ultimately doesn't matter because you just can't be nice and considerate when your own country is threatened by them.

If websites like to get paid for their content without sending out their content, they can just raise a pay wall, simple as that. If they think they are worth their income, it's an easy decision.

1336,"This will be for a much larger explanation. Generally, the Czechs had some sympathies to Russia, but were never intended to be incorporated into larger Russia or to be influenced by it. They had their own history and statehood without the need to glorify Russia.  The Slovak national awakening revolved along the line where Slovak culture, language, and society would be Russified. Czech revivalists rejected these ideas, and oriented their statehood toward France. The postwar Czechoslovak republic, even during the depth of the Red Terror (1948-1953) suppressed any Slovak national and cultural movement, and many Slovaks were imprisoned as a nationalist and fascist. Subsequently, the president Novotny disliked Slovaks and he was not hiding his anti-Slovak prejudice. He probably hated them with a passion, because even during the visits in Bratislava, he preferred to sleep over on the Moravian side. One of the large embarrassment on the public TV happened in Bratislava, when Novotny yelled on his wife dealing with a Slovak delegation, "" Boža, don't talk to them, do not take anything from them, so we can GTF out of here"".  Therefore, Slovak communists looked up in Brezhnev to get rid off Novotny. Brezhnev listened these calls and Novotny was demoted from the position and replaced with Slovak Dubcek who lived in USSR. This started the Slovakization of the Czechoslovak republic in 1968 and lasting till 1990.    

The 1968 invasion ended the liberalization course, but the Czech half of the federation was punished, while Slovakia achieved far more freedom than they had under Novotny. The only success of the Prague Spring was the creation of the federation, and much of the protests in 1969 were centered to Czech lands. Slovak culture was not as heavily repressed, and the purges in 1969-1970 involved much of the Czech society. Czech media, schools, publishing, film, civic and cultural institutions were shut down or purged of the liberals. Slovakia never experienced such widespread repressions and during the Normalization, Slovakia felt more free. The outcome of the repression was emigration, when significantly more Czechs had left. Population of Bohemia and Moravia lost as much people that until 1972 there were less people there than in 1967. Also Czech lands due proximity with Bavaria were hosting the majority of the Soviet troops. The significant economic slowdown and economic mismanagement accompanied by stagnant culture, and civic life was far more prevalent in the western half of the federation. The Czechs became the only nation in Europe that in the 20th century went from a highly advanced society in 1938 to low-income developing country in 1990.    

Therefore, Czechs and Slovaks look differently on the common history of the Czechoslovakia. Czechs idealized the 60s as an era of relative freedom and prosperity, while the Slovaks despised as a period of their own humiliation. The role reversed in the 1969-1989. Therefore, Slovaks did not develop such dislike toward Russia as it happened in the western half. Czechs associated anything that was related to Russia, its people, culture, politics, and society as something that could be dangerous, unfriendly, or not trustworthy; but Slovak's society lack such identification. The post-communist development in Czechia was more focused on becoming a member of the wealthy western states with USA as the leader of the free world, while Slovakia was busy establishing successful independent state. Czechs were aware that the US helped with the founding of the independent Czechoslovakia (the first lady was American, and do not feel that USA would interfere there into their matters. Slovak achieved their own autonomy/federate republic thanks to a Soviet invasion' hence the view of Russia is far more moderate.",,/r/europe/comments/98vp1c/on_this_day_50_years_ago_the_warsaw_pact_troops/e4jv2pa/,kaik1914,1534821404

1497,"&gt; In the US mandatory vaccinations would be impossible for this very reason.

*Sigh*

Vaccines are mandatory in the US (with a handful of exceptions), and have been for decades. 

Vaccines are not mandatory in most of Europe (again, with a couple of exceptions). 

According to the article, there have already been 41,000 cases of measles in Europe so far this year, including 807 in the UK.  

So far in the US, there have been 107 cases. 

In 2017, there were 24,000 cases in Europe and 118 in the US.

In 2016, it was 5,300 and 81, respectively. 

The reason is mandatory vaccinations. You can't get numbers like that without it.

The US also *freaks out* whenever there is a measles outbreak. You probably heard about the 100 or so measles cases tied to an infection at Disneyland in January 2015; it made national and, IIRC, international news.

You probably *didn't hear* about the 250 measles cases in Germany in that same month (which is 10x higher adjusting for population) because there was no press coverage. ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/98te35/measles_cases_hit_record_high_in_europe/e4jtd0s/,thewimsey,1534819685

1529,"&gt; The amount of bullshit in one comment.

This cannot be coming from a pro-Kremlin Serb...

&gt;I get that you people worship the West and hate everything Russian but this is taking things too far. 

Your kind of Kremlin defending is taking things too far.

&gt;Says who? You? You've been listed the facts of both of them doing equally horrible shit.

You list events, which are not ""equally horrible shit"". 

&gt; I agree that life for the people in the Western states was better than for those in the Warsaw pact ones, but outsides of them, the West was in many ways worse.

This is a sickening level of brainwashed.

&gt;Delusional for following facts?

Delusional for interpreting events completely in the line of Kremlin propaganda.

&gt; HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Good reason!!!??

Taking down evil leaders is a good reason.

&gt; HAHAHAHAH! The only reason they do anything is their geopolitical interests

They have normal geopolitical stances of being against evil leaders.

&gt;same for the other side, and more often than not for both sides those interests tend to be pretty horrible for those they're aimed at. 

Nothing horrible about those interests. These are morally good reasons.

&gt;Well, I wasn't the one who showed, it was the guy you replied. Not flattering him, he's just right.

My god, don't flatter him then... He's nowhere near right...

&gt;Really? So installing and supporting all sorts of dictators doesn't undermine your beloved democracy?

Those dictators replaced worse dictators or democratic leaders, who sided with even worse dictators, who worked on destroying the entire democratic world.

&gt; Being best buddies with the likes of Saudi Arabia is perfectly fine?

No, but without Saudi Arabia, it would be very difficult to have a foothold in the Middle East to fight against even more evil leaders.

&gt;If so you're understand is pretty fucking horrible. Neither side is good or has good intentions, both just care about their interests and won't hesitate to do some bad shit to have their way.

A brainwashed Serb trying to take the moral high ground by stating that ""neither side is good"" doesn't mean it's true. It's quite simple really. The West is generally good and shitty dictatorships like Russia are generally bad.

&gt; For example a dictatorship that sticks to itself is a lot better of morally than a democracy that goes around blowing up countries. 

Newsflash: one can ""blow up countries"" for a good reason. You have a very narrow understanding of global affairs.

&gt;So, while your point may be true there's other, more important things to consider. Weight it all in and neither side is really morally superior. 

Yet the West is.

&gt; Please, explain why? Iraq is far and wide worse than anything Russia's done since, in fact it alone is worse than all the shit Russia has done. 

Invading Iraq was thoughtless due to not putting enough forces in it to stabilize it after the invasion. However it was still a morally good thing to do as its dictator was one of the most evil leaders in the world at the time.

&gt;Are you telling me that the likes of the FSA, ISIS, Al-Nusra etc. aren't nuts?

I wouldn't really put FSA into the same category with ISIS or al-Nusra. FSA has a complicated history as it started out as a morally good anti-government force. Only later did it evolve into something different.

And these are not the only powers at play in Syria and in either case, I am certainly not convinced that Assad would be better than the current FSA.

&gt; Of course I'll justify them.

And this is a sickening thing to do, don't you understand that?

&gt;They're not perfect but in many cases they're the best option

According to whom? Did you check the people, who weren't asked?

&gt;and they're more often than not better than anarchy.

I don't think you understand how rare an anarchy-like situation is.

&gt;Iraq, Libya and Syria are perfect examples of this.

These are all different conflicts, with different reasonings, different sides and different outcomes. Please don't be that person, who mentions them in one sentence to make a lazy point.

&gt; They weren't perfect before the wars but they're a lot worse now.

Doubtful. It depends to whom you mean. And **only** the dictator fighting against his ousting is to blame for this.

&gt;Essentially, they and their people were better of with a dictator.

Chosen people were.

&gt;And I understand how people can suffer under them, but they'll suffer a lot more in civil war and anarchy.

All people suffer in a civil war and anarchy, while only the brave suffer in a dictatorship. Your country will never rise again if you keep systematically eating out the brave.

&gt;Then who was, if not the country with the highest living standard and one of the continent's richest countries?

The most developed democracy. A dictatorship may have a high living standard, but it is sickening to consider it the best country. All democracies are better than all dictatorships.

&gt;That sure worked out in Iraq.

More resources into that war was necessary to bring stability and sustainability.

&gt;Deposing Gaddafi is what turned it into hell.

No, it was a hell under Gaddafi.

&gt;But you won't accept that.

Of course I won't accept some pro-dictatorship propaganda.

In 2003 they passed the Communications Act which makes it illegal to “use public electronic communications network in order to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety” and punishment is up to half a year in jail.

On New Year's Eve 2015-2016, over a thousand women reported sexual assault along with theft of personal belongings by groups of African men in Cologne, Germany. This was systematically covered up until it leaked out nearly two weeks later.

In 2017 the ""Code of Conduct for illegal online hatespeech"" was passed. This is why currently, everything slightly critical of Islam, LGBT, etc whether satirical or not is being swiftly removed from all social media. Because the EU will place *massive* fines on the companies that fail to remove the offending content within 24 hours.

In 2018 Article 13 was passed which regards copyright and effectively makes *all* memes illegal. The algorythm intended for this has widely become known as ""the censorship machine"" as its purpose is to censor law-breaking images (memes) from being uploaded or viewed.

They also introduced Article 11, the ""link tax"" which has in previous instances lead to entire countries effectively being cut off from the outside world. Essentially it costs companies money to host links from affected countries. Not censorship in its own right, but when tested in Italy and Germany it lead to the companies simply not hosting links from aforementioned countries. A good way to cut off your population from the rest of the world.

That's all I've got off the top of my head. Here's some miscellanious censorship.

Germany has outright banned criticism of Islam on Twitter and Facebook. The UK has been more lenient on their own version of the law but people are getting arrested at unprecedented rates for what I can only describe as ""cyberbullying"".

1598," That's because there is no exact term to 3rd World Countries/Undeveloped Economies, your version of 1st World(US Influence) and 2nd World (Soviet) is just the cover of the book for 10th grade economics but when you go study some geopolitics in an Economical University, things were different and more complex than a simple line on the map.

 In 1968, Romania was ""enjoying"" a ""Undeveloped Country"" status (which in terms, was real from all point of views) but from a simple geopolitical point of view was 2nd World because of what you are saying, it was alligned to Comecon. 

Still, economically it was not developed and lagged behind other ‘allies’. Things weren't at all similar in the Bloc, though the propaganda wanted to make you think they were equally doing well and we were gonna help each other to not miss something.

 The communist party needed money to invest in infrastructure and take the industry to levels it could perform. But this meant it needed to loan money, from who? Other socialist states? Not enough. Needed the western money and western companies to come and invest. Heavily even, to keep things working

 Ceausescu had 0 sympathy for Dubcek's reforms (something fairly known in memoirs by people close to him) and even feared the disease would spread.

 First, Ceausescu's fear was to have a similar faith to Dubcek because he wasn't exactly in the best relations with the Soviets. But in terms of economical views, he had stronger Stalinist views than Brezhnev himself. And there was also a very strong thing he was basing his actions on: Romanians hated Russian's by nature (especially after what happened post WW2). His move was seen patriotic and skyrocketed his popularity among people.

 But this came with problems, first of all, there were probable plans for a September 2 invasion of Romania by the Warsaw Pact, which would've turned worse than the one in Czechoslovakia because they already brutally invaded in 1944 and stayed there till 1958.

 Ceausescu's plan was to gain influence with the USA, and people hoping for a second Marshall Plan doubled by a NATO protection of the country. Despite it being a long shot, the reason the Soviet's didn't eventually invade was because it would've been costly for them too, they were disturbed by his attitude but were OK knowing he was loyal to socialism, unlike Dubcek who was clearly trying to bring change, they prepared troops for the invasion on the border, and a good role of calming intentions were coming from USA and China, including Lyndon Johnson's intervention with Soviet embassy to calm shit down.

 His economical interests were linked to modernizing industry, money from COMECON was completely insufficient so he shifted towards loaning from the IMF in the late 60's, but because of accords seeing Romania as being a developing country(a ambition to gain popularity again by making Romania 'look good'), no interest-free loans and various other conditions. Romanian kept on loaning money from the IMF, and it somehow needed to pay off those debts so that's where the shit storm started and the communists decided to pay everything on the backs of Romanian's and even losing relations with the West making ties with other dictatorships like the Central African Republic, Irak or Cuba. Investments there didn't pay off so he left the country starving and freezing(median temperature in an apartment was 10 Celsius during a 3-4 month winter) and by the time he payed those debts in a decade, decided he should continue to pay but to loan money to undeveloped nations or invest directly in Cuba. Castro, Bokassa, Hussein or Gaddafi being best friends, ended up paying nothing back(except Hussein who it seems, actually did until he was hanged) and eventually tried to do in 1989 the same as in 1968, to gather people in the same place, only this time he was promising 15$, not a anti-Russian measure, so people were mad and cold enough as winter was starting again and their asses freezing once again waiting in line for a loaf of bread and 3 eggs coupled.

1600,"Everybody knows the story of profligate Greece by now. We don't need to keep rehashing it in every comment. What we're talking about is where do they go from here.

There are two separate levels you can view this from. I would start with your more preferred level, macro. Other commentors in this thread stated that interest on Greek loans was 1.6%, with an average maturity of 34 years. Current 5 and 10 year sov bonds are running between 3-5%, depending on which maturity you're looking at. Let's assume a growth rate of 2%. Don't think it's possible, but just hypothetically.

Practical result is that even where markets are happy to accept Greek sov bonds, and Greece can borrow, they are cut off from the markets anyway. They can't sustain borrowing as a tool, they lose money using it. They are consequently extremely vulnerable to any market shocks in the future. Much of that is investor confidence they cannot control.

More importantly, nothing about your macro analysis provides a mechanism for economic growth. If we assume Greece keeps the same budgets and budgetary profile, then the punitive level of taxation to fund govt coffers cancels out capacity to grow. People seem fine with this when they know the money is going to repay debt, but it's not fine when Greeks are trying to rebuild some of the 25% lost GDP. 

Here's where I turn to a more micro level. In order to facilitate growth, you need domestic demand. Not just selling off Greek assets in fireside sales. A minimum wage job in Greece pays €683 per month, for a 40 hour week. With 20 working days in a month, that's pay of €34.15 a day. With an 8 hour working day, that's €4.27 per hour. Minimum wage in my country is twice this, plus some, and things aren't so much cheaper in Greece.

I was just in Corfu, one of the more affordable islands in June, and 500ml of Corfu domestic beer was €5. Hence for one hour's work, the waitress who served me the beer couldn't even afford to buy one herself. How it is people survive on that, let alone build sustainable economic growth, is beyond me.

The other thing about it was that the problems I encountered in Greece weren't anything to do with dodgy scams to avoid taxes. Everywhere took my visa card and everywhere was running POS systems which recorded the transactions, issuing me receipts unless I waived them away. 

What didn't work in Corfu were municipal services. Like refuse collection. Traders I think have tried to do the best they can to hide the giant pile of bags and the smell from tourists. But it's shocking once you see it. Toilets are another one--chronically broken toilets and a total ban on putting even toilet paper into the commode. Because the pipes can't handle it. Or the main tourist palace in the middle of Old Town that has fallen into disrepair because there's no money to maintain it. And so on. 

Traders are working very hard to sell tourists goods and services, if my little visit is representative. But they are battling the city itself to do it.

So where does the cash come from to start paying for the refuse to be collected again, or to fix the pipes, both of which tourists depend on? If taxes are pushed up yet again, traders will bear the brunt of it and either turn to black commerce or close shop. There's no blood from stones. 

So when I say the challenges facing Greece, I mean that sure things seem just fine if you look at only a few macro-financial details. But if you try to imagine the path out of the current situation, short of spending money Greece doesn't have, there does not appear to be one.

Yes, that is literally how the court system works: it follows the law because that's what the law requires of it. If it's mistaken or deficient in doing so, higher courts can amend the decisions of lower ones.

&gt; And if they don't?

You're positing that the entire Italian judicial system, from the lowliest Justice of the Peace to the Court of Cassation, would simply refuse to enforce a compensation judgement.

That is, you're basically positing that your politics have won so decisively in the country that every single part of the law enforcement mechanism ignores its legal duties in their name.

Like I told another user, this isn't an argument, it's a childish fantasy; it's what children do when they say ""well then I have invicible armor"". You're imagining that you've won and won so completely that there's no way things could ever not go your way. It's a fine fantasy if you like that sort of thing, just not a creditable argument.

1660,"&gt; calling USA fascist is implicitly defending fascism? Or did they contribute enough in the European front to gain that amazing perk?

It depends. Who is calling the USA fascist in which context out of what reasoning?

Now, if you were saying that the USA are no better than Nazi Germany or something like ""The scourge of liberalism was nothing better than the scourge of fascism"", I would say that is implicitly defending fascism as well.

&gt; Why compare it with India when you can pick any other European nation.

Because China in 1949 was at a completely different level of development than Western Europe in 1945?

&gt; They did what any communist nation did much better and efficiently. And everybody kept their basic human rights.

lol no? Rapid industrialization in any country throughout history involved a great deal of massive human suffering and the Soviet Union and PRC were not much worse in that regard than the US and UK were only a century prior.

&gt; And you can't plead to colonization since both the SU and China relied heavily in slavery and mass murder.

That's... exactly what I plead. Western nations just exported the suffering required for rapid industrialization for the most part (though even so a factory in 19th century England was not a nice place to be) while the USSR and PRC had to keep it domestic.

&gt; And to be honest, I'd rather live in a poor society with basic human rights than under Stalinist or Maoist regime.

Only someone who has never experienced poverty themselves could say something like this. I can't eat ""basic human rights"" or live in them or cure diseases with them. Human rights are an ideological mirage that means nothing in practice. Poor people de facto have no rights.

Little advice in France politeness is key of course it's better to start in French, Bonjour, excuse me, goes a long way to get some help. You don't chit chat with strangers in the subway. French people are a tough nut to crack, if you bother them they'll let you know, they won't pretend.

It's harder to befriend us, but when it's done you'll have friend you can keep around.
That is Especially true in Paris where the streets tend to be crowded with tourists to the point you have to avoid whole areas in summer so many average citizens really suffer from so much mass tourism, but it'll be something you'll see more and more like in Amsterdam or Barcelona

Please don't start with this dumb shit of African team. You want to know why English is not popular here ? Exactly because of the behaviour this guy shown, a complete disregard of our culture and the values we stand for. American people are viewed as entitled arrogant know it all assholes. Funny since that's how you view French people no ?

I worked as a waiter for a time and I saw many tourists, most of them were delightful but some were behaving like I was supposed to be a servant or something like this, and in France that's a complete no. Also waiters are not constently checking up on you, giving fake smiles and waiting next to you while you order, we do things differently, and while I can understand it can be perceived as rudeness it just how we do it here.

1789,"&gt; Germans don’t decide what European values are.

I think that when people say ""European values"" in an EU legal context, they're normally referring to the bit codified in Article 2 of the Lisbon Treaty.

http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-1-common-provisions/2-article-2.html

&gt;Article 2
&gt;
&gt; The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.

I think that it would be fair to say that while these are couched as value statements, if they are to be used as a legally-binding mechanism to transfer power from the member state governments to the central government, they are concerningly vague.  I mean, ""human dignity"" or ""tolerance"" or ""solidarity"" could potentially span a terrifically-broad range of things based on interpretation.  I can imagine a communist government making a reasonable legal argument that EU members had committed to a communist system if they bound themselves to ""solidarity"" and ""equality"".",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/98ul40/europes_values_are_not_negotiable_german_foreign/e4j71xz/,vokegaf,1534791870
1790,"&gt;I honestly have no idea how you read my comment

I'll explain. 

For the undesirable content to appear someone or something must create and put it there. On the other side someone or something has to remove it. I believe the capabilities are really not in the favour for promoters of terrorism ideologies. There's just little incentive to act to remove such content at the moment. At the end of the day, no one is asking to identify the content. The good men in black suits will do that for you. You'll just have to be kind enough to SWIFTLY remove it. Either you do it automatically, or do some review (which is not asked for and you still will have to remove it if you don't want to break the law), it's up to you. Social media had a chance and chance again to stop such content being published, they failed, and failed again. It seems they work much better when they are under threat of litigation (just try to upload Hollywood movie, I doubt it will last a minute, let alone an hour). So their inaction brought this on their heads. 

All this talk about algorithms needed or manpower needed is pointless anyway. They are not being asked to identify themselves. There are others more capable. There's no way terrorist will upload more content than security will be able to track. Some agencies have a lot of resources. So much resources Facebook or Google are weather apps compared to it.

“Students linked arms but were mown down. **APCs then ran over the bodies time and time again to make, quote ‘pie’ unquote, and remains collected by bulldozer.** 

**“Remains incinerated and then hosed down drains.”**

“1,000 survivors were told they could escape but were then mown down by specially prepared MG [machine gun] positions.

“Army ambulances who attempted to give aid were shot up, as was a Sino-Japanese hospital ambulance.  With medical crew dead, wounded driver attempted to ram attackers but was blown to pieces by anti-tank weapon.”

27 Army troops had used dum-dum bullets and “snipers shot many civilians on balconies, street sweepers etc for target practice”.

 “Wounded girl students begged for their lives but were bayoneted.

“A three-year-old girl was injured, but her mother was shot as she went to her aid, as were six others.”

In 2014, it was reported that a confidential US government file quoted a Chinese military source as saying the Communist regime’s own internal assessment believed **10,454 people had been killed** – a figure that would fit Sir Alan’s initial estimate.

&gt;Engineers of the highway operator and state supervision knew that the tension cables of the Ponte Morandi in Genoa were heavily rusted. But nothing was done.
Andres Wysling 20.8.2018, 07:11

&gt;The tensioning cables of the bridge in Genoa were heavily affected by rust. An investigation had shown that they were rusted in cross section to 10 to 20 percent. The test report was discussed by seven engineers from a technical commission on 1 February, five representing the Italian State, two representing the motorway operator Autostrade per l'Italia. This is reported by the Italian magazine «L'Espresso».

&gt;The investigation did not lead to any immediate measures. The bridge was neither completely closed nor partially relieved, for example by a lock for trucks, the closure of a lane or a speed limit. It was only recommended to reinforce the tensioning cables as part of a planned refurbishment. The traffic continued as before, unchecked, with fatal consequences.


&gt;The rust was detected in tests with electric current: this could not flow normally in the steel cables. Other test methods were used. One (called Sonreb-Win) was criticized by one of the engineers for being unreliable and unimportant. The same engineer - Antonio Brencich, who has been criticizing the bridge since 2016 and has given many interviews in the last few days - criticized the lack of fluoroscopic gamma rays and drilling samples. Nevertheless, he and the other representatives of the State stated in the minutes of the meeting, with five signatures, that the test report was carefully drafted, comprehensive, methodologically sound. With this result, the examination result was forwarded to Rome.

&gt;It is not clear from the newspaper report how the engineers - not all members of the technical commission were constructive civil engineers - assessed the overall condition of the bridge, whether they were directly threatened by rust, whether they feared a sudden collapse of the bridge, if they sounded the alarm the competent authorities in the Ministry of Transport and the Autostrade company. In any case, they did not give any warnings or recommendations in their minutes of the meeting, they did not demand any measures, such as a partial discharge or the complete closure of the bridge.

&gt;It seems that the engineers were content to examine the test report, but did not make their own conclusions about the jeopardy of the bridge. Perhaps such an assessment was not part of their mission. But who, if not the professionals, should sound the alarm?

&gt;It is noted in the newspaper report that a representative of the state in the technical commission was in a paid employment relationship with the company Autostrade. In addition, two of the five members of the technical commission now belong to the Commission of Inquiry, which has been involved in the bridge collapse on behalf of the Ministry of Transport since Friday: the architect Roberto Ferrazza is its president and the engineer Antonio Brencich a member. The constellation is spicy - the controlled control themselves.

TL.DR: At least since February 2018 it was known that the support cables were heavily rusted.  Engineering commission consisting of both Autostrada and official members did nothing but forwarded report along official channels. At least one member of that commission is now a member of the investigation board.

2060,"Well if I buy a car and it gets stolen, the date when I get my car back is not very important.

But more seriously:

* restoration of independence de-legitimized all attempts to claim that Estonia had joined the Soviet Union voluntarily;
* all property taken away from Estonia and given to the Soviets during the illegal occupation had to be returned to Estonia to retain good face (Sweden compensating it with money, Finland bought the former Estonian embassy from Bulgaria and gave it back to Estonia etc.);
* Estonia was automatically a subject of international law it had been a subject in 1940;
* Some states even refused to recognize Estonia again as they never ceased to recognize it during the Soviet occupation. This is why Iceland's recognition shouldn't be overemphasized either;
* Estonia was not obliged by international law to make illegal Soviet immigrants citizens of Estonia;
* the [areas taken away from Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_changes_of_the_Baltic_states#/media/File:Baltic_states_borders.jpg) and annexed into Russia were still legally part of Estonia.

That's also the reason why the colloquial ""First Republic"" is rather an incorrect term for the pre-occupation era as we are currently still living in the first Republic of Estonia.

In national law it pretty much meant return to the legal situation of 1940 unless decided otherwise (which it often was for practical reasons). But properties taken away from 1940 owners were on a large scale taken back from the illegal owners (often illegal Soviet era immigrants) and returned to their original owners. Many Estonian families got a lot of property back, my grandparents for example got two houses in a small town that were taken from their parents when they were deported to Siberia.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/98quos/today_is_the_estonian_restoration_of_independence/e4ij566/,l22gej22r,1534770292

2149,"&gt;The Surinamese, Indonesians and Moroccans certainly manage that in the Netherlands.

The Surinamese and Indonesians already spoke Dutch when they came, and were familiar with Dutch culture due to colonization. Moroccans are having tremendously higher crime rates (23 times more likely to commit violent crimes than the rest of the country), are overrepresented in prisons (10+%), are lower educated, and have higher rates of welfare. For you to say this group is well intergraded would be hilarious if it weren't for the fact you're a fellow voter. 

As for the economics you're completely missing the reality. We're at the forefront of a fourth industrial revolution that is going to wipe out entire industries. Autonomous trucking is going to be here within the next 5 years. That alone is 150.000 jobs that will be wiped out in about a decade and a half. Where do you think all those people are going to work? That's where the new elementary occupation employees are going to come from.

You brushing aside the effect of an increase of **millions** of more dependents on European welfare states as some marginal minuscule impact on state finances, is shocking. Of the Somalis in the Netherlands, 70% (!!!) is on welfare. It's is baffling to read you are under the impression that if a group of millions starts taking out money the system without putting any in, it is in anyway sustainable. And that doesn't even take into the account of the billions in addition to that that will be needed for education, housing, integration, or law enforcement.

If you were saying we need to take these people in from a moral obligation/humanitarian reason, that'd be fine. I disagree, but that's an opinion and not a fact. But the idea that immigration from third world countries is somehow *economically* positive, is bullshit. [The Centraal Planbureau \(CPB\) concludes](https://www.trouw.nl/home/hoeveel-kost-een-gevluchte-syrier-eigenlijk-echt-~a8db7660/) that a non-Western immigrant costs the taxpayer 43.000EUR.

Ships don't work like cars, you can't just park on the beach, let people out, and then take off.

Then you are completely ignorant about the meaning of this day. You're exactly right it's about celebrating the individuals, not the legion itself.

&gt;That is why you don't see celebrations of SS units anywhere else in Europe, even if their members no longer can participate.

Because you cannot compare our situation to nowhere else in Europe. People have differing traditions based off of historical experience - hence why half of Europe celebrates the 9th of May in a huge way, while the other might have quiet, personal commemoration for the 8th of May.

Plus, these were primarily forced conscripts, not volunteers as they were from other countries. Can you see the reasoning why you would not celebrate volunteers, but commemorate conscripts?

&gt;It is a historical fact that the Jew-murdering Arajs commando and Latvian police battalions formed the core of the SS Latvian Legion.

And? So point out the actual mass murderers and those who participated in the genocide, since we'd like for them to be punished as well. The actual fact that the combat divisions, put into the SS because their actual formation was a warcrime according to the Geneva rules (which the Germans skirted by putting them into the SS, and hence everyone uneducated thinks literally all of them were death-hand Einsatzgruppen nazis), were vast majority comprised of people forced into service (i.e. conscription) means nothing to you? Or that there is no proof of any atrocities committed by them?

Dude, you can easily say the Legionnaire commemoration day is controversial, but it's stupid to say that it's an official policy of denying the Latvians did the Holocaust. The units themselves - 15th and 19th Waffen SS Grenadier divisions - did not participate in the genocide against the Jews as far as there is any factual evidence - so I see no correlation between ''oh they allow conscripted veterans to commemorate the war'' and ''denying their involvement in the Holocaust''.",Damn dirty sexy Balts..,/r/europe/comments/98kagu/nearly_half_of_russians_ignorant_invasion_of/e4ie40l/,LatvianLion,1534763127

EU countries cannot boycott Italy over this even if they wanted to. Italy is, after all, a member of the EU and part of the common market. Moreover, right-wing governments in other EU member states would risk a backlash from their own voters if they sanction Italy over this.

&gt; I asked who would stop them. If not honoring the rulings of the ECHR is an option, what makes you think doing the same over their constitutional court isn't? After all, what enforcement powers do those have? 

I don't know Italy's constitutional structure, but presumably the president is independent from the government and would have the power to allow him to enforce a constitutional court ruling. It's very different from international treaties. Because states are sovereign, treaties are only meaningful as long as their signatories choose to abide by them.

At the end of the day, you're ignoring the reality that the issues we do have with immigration are not all that impactful in the grand scheme of things. In other words: putting your emotions over facts and being proud of it.

Should we do about nationality X and Y being on welfare far more than the national average? Obviously yes. Does this amount to minuscule, fraction of a % sums when put against the national budget, and do we spend magnitudes more on areas most people never think twice about? Also obviously yes.

The deals for natural resources existed even during the cold war, because both sides relay on it. If europe, and for most as one of the best customers, Germany, would dicide to get their natural resources from somewhere else, the russian economy would be hit severly.

2356,"Spaniard that lived in Sweden here. 
Honestly, I think that a lot of the controversy comes from two factors:
1. The high standards of civism in Sweden make any trouble look like pure chaos. 
- What can be considered mayhem there, could be easily forgettable in other places of Europe.
- For instance, Spain had a similar episode of gangs burning 150 cars in just one city in 2013 and almost nobody remembers that, responsibles haven’t been chased nor found and media gave it just the “right” amount of coverage.
Source: https://elpais.com/ccaa/2013/02/04/valencia/1359977997_326065.amp.html
- More recently, taxi drivers sindicates had some violent episodes against several Uber cars.

- What some call a “no-go zone” in Sweden would be any below-average income district in a country like Spain. Having actually more to do with poverty and unemployment than with migration.
- Issues with drug cartels are more regular and accute anytime in Spain or Italy and not as much is heard.
2. The international alt-right social media propaganda used Sweden to construct the narrative of an exemplar liberal-socialist downfall, oftenly exaggerating anecdotic events and plainly inventing data and news, like the very existance of no-go zones as war zones.
- The spreading of that discourse pulsates almost simultaneously through several related channels like “Tutti il crimini degli immigranti”, “Vox noticias”, “voice of europe”, “Breitbart”, etc...

yes france is not at the level of english on the world stage anymore since 50% of the world GDP is produced by english speaking country (11% fof french speaking), but more because 

1-french language is widely spoke so you don't have to rely on english language as much as for example the dutch or the swedes

2-france is not a country of merchand and business, therefore learning a foreign language isn't in the culture

saying that french is as relevant as english is indeed false, but going full throttle on the extrem and saying it is not relevant at all is not true

The Westminster terror suspect has been charged with two counts of attempted murder by driving a car through crowds outside Parliament.

Salih Khater, 29, will appear in court facing a count of attempting to murder members of the public and one count of attempting to murder police officers, following the incident outside the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.

The Sudanese-born suspect, who is a British citizen, allegedly drove his vehicle into pedestrians and cyclists before swerving towards police officers.

He then crashed into barriers outside the Palace of Westminster and was arrested. Three people were treated for non-life threatening injuries after the incident.

The defendant is due before Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday.

The incident promoted a major counter terrorism operation, with police carrying out a number of property searches and Khater detained under section 41 of the Terrorism Act.

Rooftop camera footage shows his Ford Fiesta mounting a pavement on the wrong side of the road before, witnesses said, it travelled around 40 metres (130ft) and hit a bollard.

Two weeks ago, Khater received his British citizenship meaning he could travel back to Sudan safely on his British passport.

Prosecutors will be treating his case as terrorism due to the method of the alleged attack, the targets selected and the high-profile location, the Metropolitan Police said after charging him on Saturday.

Earlier this week, a friend of Khater’s told the Daily Telegraph that he was not himself as of late.

The local taxi driver, who did not wish to be identified, said: “Last time I saw him, which was about two weeks ago, he was not himself at all. ...  because of his family problems, they were causing him a lot of stress. His father and [sibling] all died within a couple of months of each other.”

And the only reason I remember about it is because me and my friend were assigned a presentation about it.  
Until the recent change in schools, we covered history 2 times in repeat: classes 4-6 : everything, ending with wwii at the end of class 6, 1-3 of middle school: beggining-partitions, 1st of high school- napoleon-present. Included in that are all the uprisings, so, you know, very important, takes a lot of time. After wwii stuff is skimmed, mostly focused on how **bad** it was and how we **fought** against it.

All Asians bordering Ming reee'd at him to end tributary status to trigger the [disaster](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Unguarded_Nomadic_Frontier) but he refused during the session, instead focused on Yarkand under Ming protection. Then during the week of diplomacy he apparently gave in, ended tributary status and declared on Ming, then Tibet and Timurids declared on him. I'm not sure how the Ming war ended, think he lost some provinces, but he managed to beat back Timurids and Tibet and forced them to a white peace, after which those 2 ended Alliance and all other Asians started declaring on Ming, so now Oirat currently is in a war against Ming again and also against one of the splinters, Shan or Shun or whatever.",Deutschland,/r/europe/comments/98n977/reurope_plays_europa_universalis_iv_season_5_week/e4hxz9i/,chairswinger,1534734820

2676,"&gt; English vocab is about 60% French and Latin in origin.

Which is a bit misleading because often the more basic words are germanic (i.e. those you use more frequently in everyday language) and the more sophisticated ones are latin or french. A lot of latin words were specifically created within science. Everyone knows english has huge ammounts of dead vocabulary that is almost never used. I mean all languages have some but english has incredibly large swathes of it. And on top of it quite a bit of the latin/french influence is present within other germanic langauges aswell just not as much. From speaking 2 other germanic languages I definitely found english much easier to get into than into french from speaking english.

2697,"The difference is that roma cultures in europe actually promotes criminal behavior. No racism in saying that when it is obviously true. 

They shun education and honest jobs even in those countries where they cause least problems. Even the law abiding roma people often refuse to get education for actual jobs. Your examples fail totally because we want then to go to same schools than our kids. In Finland where the situation is generally good around 20% of the roma children don't pass the compulsory comprehensive school (over 99 percent of general population passes) and literally only a couple go to high school. Although there has been some improvement in getting them to vocational schools.

The main problem is that their culture was built on nomadic ideas where people traveled buying and selling stuff and doing some work that suited the lifestyle (like managing horses in big construction sites). Those jobs have disappeared but the culture hasn't accepted the change. Other parts of the culture cause additional trouble. For example roma women are often not allowed to be seen by non roma people wearing anything but the traditional dresses. Which obviously prevents doing any work where you would need to use uniform. Their internal honor codes often prevent interaction with authorities in criminal cases. There was a case a decade or so ago 
where one roma man talked about problems in television and received dozens of death threats as a consequence. In another case a roma woman talked in television and as a result received public slander by high ranking members of finnish roma community (who was later convicted of it). 

In the end the result of all the cultural problems is that even though the roma form only around 0.2 percent of the population here they commit around 20 percent of all theft. That is quite an achievement if there is nothing wrong in the culture. ",Finland,/r/europe/comments/98l5jm/reurope_starterpack/e4hsw3b/,jaaval,1534729510

2813,"&gt;You say we see most people not coming from war zones but that is not correct let alone relevant. If you are not in danger, you don't receive asylum. Simple as that. 30% of applicants received refugee status.

How is it not relevant? There is a difference between a direct war on your border and taking in refugees, and just taking in people who show up because they have it bad in their country.

&gt;Morocco makes up less than 1% of asylum applications and only 7% are successful. 90 people. 90 Moroccans received asylum in the first quarter of 2018. Tunesia makes up a proportion of applicants so small it's not even included as a country or origin.

The people coming into Spain are coming through Morocco. Morocco needs to work with the EU to stop that. And if they don't want to, they can be offered some terms for it, or we need to use our influence to make them. Also, Moroccans make up almost 6% of the people registered by the UN.

&gt;If you want to claim they throw away their identification to try and get in under another nationality, fat chance. Again, less than 1% of applicants is stateless.

Good, then we know where they are coming from and can sent them straight to the refugee camps there if they are fleeing from a war.

&gt;Your entire opinion is based on fiction. There is no wave of economic migrants. Why not? Because they don't make a chance being accepted. To create an international scene with an ally over 90 people who rightfully receive refugee status is absolutely absurd.

Meanwhile, we still have thousands of people arriving and needing to be processed. While that is going on, they can go around Europe freely. And if they get denied, they can disappear into an illegal life. Or their country doesn't take them back, leading to a years long process to get them on an airplane. Which is what needs to be fixed.

Of course this is not about 90 people, this is about the tens of thousands of others: [https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean). It is way less then it was a few years back, but it still too much, leading to political chaos, people angry with the EU, and no system in place for when it does go up again, like what is happening in Spain this summer. And if you don't agree with that, it still needs to be done to stop people putting themselves in danger and drowning.",,/r/europe/comments/98koz8/italy_threatens_to_return_migrants_to_libya_in/e4hbx6m/,cissoniuss,1534712274

You can get Nitric acid with a high voltage arc trougth the air and gather nitrous oxide pass trougth water and you have a bitric acid.

You can nitrate cotton or paper to get nitro-celulose which is the base component of smokeless gunpowder. 

Or if you are stupid enougth you can go and get some glycerin which is a base of those vaping liquids. This will require a few extra steps which I do not know as you cannot nitrate glycerin directly.





NB : I am talking out of my ass here and this is school chemistry and physics levels. Nitric acid is extremely potent and has a tendency to fume above a certain concentration giving a gas that will react into acid inside you if you breathe it in. Brething in nitrous oxide will also create nitric acid in your breathing system. Niroglycerin is one of the most potent explosives which is out of use for a very long time , because it is very easy to tigger which means it left a bloody trail and not because it was used in wars.

BTW, I don't understand what Poland are doing in the EU if they don't trust most of its members. The UK had clout to play that game, EE is simply going to get the two speed treatment.

You know don't know that there is a Slovenian minority in Italy? Who has also about the same rights that you guys have? Ah and for your information there are also French speakers in Aosta valley that again have the same rights that you have

.so as you can see your foolish theory of without Austria we would have been butchered lt is kind at odds with that thing called reality.

No I would have never took out on my own. While some South Tyroleans like to pretend they live on the Gaza strip.

No. I am pointing out that you are moaning and pretty ignorant of history at that.

Have you ever hard on any media Slovenian speakers complaining how hard was for them? Probably not.

You know how often I hear about South tirolens complaining about suffering most of them are too young to have experienced ? Often. Usually in attempt to extract concessions or just attract pity. 


&gt;3. Do you know what propaganda is? I am not promoting a political cause i am telling the truth about my land. Being pity and propaganda dont go together very well.

3101,"Well thats a bit intellectually dishonest. Yes, slavery was present in Africa before the British, Spanish and Portuguese came. However, the scale of it was far smaller. It was common for there to be small wars between tribes with the loser having to give up some of the population as spolia in the form of slaves among other respurces. This strengthened the victor, and also allowed for population replenishment in existing communities.
The introduction of Europeans and more specifically European arms led to a vicous feedback loop. The chiefs and kings wanted these European arms for power projection and protection, so they started wars expressly to enslave, which they in turn traded to the Europeans for those arms, which allowed them to more easily start new wars. Which lead to a massive increase in slavery, since it now was a commodity to be traded. This itself lead to the annihilation of many small tribes, kingdoms and the destruction of autochtonous urban centers, even excluding the ones the Europeans would destroyed themselves when they cut out the middle men and set up their own authorities.

3103,"I was born, raised and educated in the Dominican Republic; that in itself doesn’t make me an expert but History happens to be my main interest and I read a lot about topics that interest me.  I have read, cover to cover “[The History of Haiti](https://www.amazon.com/History-Greenwood-Histories-Modern-Nations/dp/0313340897/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534687680&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=history+of+haiti)” and “[The Dominican Republic: A National History](https://www.amazon.com/Dominican-Republic-National-History/dp/1558765190/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534687861&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=history+of+the+dominican+republic)”.  I know what I’m talking about, I’m not just quoting a poorly sourced Wikipedia article.

You apparently have a deficit in geography, can’t read or are being unnecessary dense; I’m talking about the Dominican Republic here, not Haiti.  I have been very clear in stating that even though Spain ceded  its colony (Santo Domingo) to France in 1795, France never took full control of it.  A representative of the French government was sent to Santo Domingo, but Spanish colonial authorities ruled the place until 1801.

That’s when Toussaint Louvertue, heading a rebel army marched east and took control of the territory on behalf of France and to enforce the term of the Treaty of Basel.  Except that he wasn’t authorized by the French government to do this and they sent a huge invasion force in 1802 with the goal of taking control of the whole island and reinstating slavery.  That force was supported by Spanish colonials, who were not interested in Toussaint’s revolution and didn’t want to free their slaves.

That war lasted for two years and culminated in the foundation of Haiti in 1804; [the first constitution of  Haiti in 1805](http://faculty.webster.edu/corbetre/haiti/history/earlyhaiti/1805-const.htm) established that the whole island (not the western side) was its territory.  I’m quoting now from the second book I linked above:

&gt; “The war ended with the most spectacular defeat for French army. More than fifty thousand soldiers died in twenty months of fighting, leaving from that formidable army some 600 men of Montecristi under the command of General Ferrand, and another 400 in Santo Domingo under the command of General Kerversau.”

England at that time had intervened in the conflict against the French, its main rival during the Napoleonic wars.  General Kerversau surrendered, but not Ferrand who took his 600 men to Santo Domingo and deposed and shipped Kerversau out of the island.  Ferrand got 300 additional French soldiers and 500 Spaniards and attempted to hold on to Santo Domingo against an Haitian army of 21,000 soldiers in March 1805.  The siege lasted for three weeks and was lifted upon the arrival of a French fleet, which the Haitians though was heading to the western side to disembark and take control of the former Haitian colony.

In this situation, the only way that you can claim that France controlled the Spanish colony is if you pretend that Ferrand had control of it in behalf of France.  He didn’t; he was basically fighting with Haitians and Spanish colonials until 1809.  This period is called the “Spanish reconquest of Santo Domingo” [and there’s even a monument in the Dominican Republic celebrating the main battle of that war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Palo_Hincado).  

Again, these are historical facts; stop arguing about matters that you clearly know nothing about.

3108,"&gt; Hope it succeeds in Russia too, but certainly not through fighting or violence, we had a bad experience with the last revolution, so we are happy to go steady and take it slow this time around.

See, that's the exact kind of pattern of thought that I not only find to be wrong, but a bit revolting. And it's not because I secretly wish for violent behavior in any neighboring countries, but because I think violence, as it is, is misunderstood and misinterpreted.  
And that what the oligarchs/corrupts/etc are doing right now, whether in Russia or in Romania or in any other country, is very much, very overwhelmingly obscenely violent. This violence however is masked behind a veil of hard-to-be-perceived corruption (for whatever reason).  
Let's say you have stealing as a corrupt act (and it is, undoubtedly a corrupt act):  
 - when a regular Joe steals something (clothes, computers, phones, money, etc), for whatever reasons, the consequence of their actions aren't big: in other words, they just left someone or some company without X product;  
 - when an oligarch steals, they steal in absurd amounts from either the state's budget or from a great number of workers; which makes them reliable for the well-being of people, thus their actions are of a much more violent nature, they affect the health, the nourishment, the well-being and the overall life span of people.  

This is why I don't really buy the ""take it slow this time around"" point of view. Sure, the richer people might afford to do that, but meanwhile the corrupts are very much killing and making people miserable.  
A very similar narrative has been told to the black community in America by the ""white moderates"", about which MLK was absolutely, 100% spot-fucking-on  

&gt; the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.  

Of course, in the case of Russia (Romania too), there's no need for ""racialization"" of such politics, but the main idea is very much valid nonetheless.  
I honestly, 100%, believe (without any malevolence on my part), that there's a *huge* disconnect and thus, as a direct result, a huge lack of empathy towards the very poor of the society -  which you know who they are, you know the conditions they live in, you know that their children don't go to school, you know that they have barely anything to eat, you know that they are in a very shitty health and financial condition, I am absolutely 100% sure that you know all of that and despite that, just as I'm sure about my similar country-men, yet you refuse to knowledge and engage with it.  
 
&gt; take it slow this time around

Well, *fuck*, that's all fine and dandy for you, Russian-moderate, but in the meanwhile your fellow country men are sick and dying.  
For once, I wish, I fucking wish, one of you insert-country-here moderates would go to the bottom of the pit and tell those poor sick fucks that you're gonna ""take it slow"" this time around.

How Putin actually operates means he needs dissident voices in the country to give the appearance of democracy, it would not be in his best interest to silence all opposition.

Did you read this article you posted? It's actually says deaths of journalists have many causes, chechens, business interests, lots of them happened before Putin as well

&gt;The violent deaths of journalists started in the Yeltsin era (1991–1999) and continued under Putin, president of Russia from 31 December 1999 to 7 May 2008. When Medvedev became president, he spoke of the need to end ""legal nihilism"".[citation needed]From 2003 to 2008 there have been a rising number of trials but by November 2009 there had yet to be a major breakthrough, under Medvedev, of either in the prosecution of pre-2008 deaths or the investigation of killings since his May 2008 inauguration. The Politkovskaya murder trial and the first arrests in the Baburova-Markelov slaying (November 2009) showed some inconclusive signs of movement.



The journalist murder rate actually stayed consistent from the 90s until today.

3124,"Interesting photo. Is there a parade of some sort in Kiev?

I'll just list the contents of the photo for those curious.

~~On the bottom right we have three BM-30 Smerch missile launchers - the ones with 16 long tubes each - which shoot 300mm rockets at maximum range of 90km. Not very precise but with cluster munitions they are a pain in the ass.  Russia used them to shoot from across the border during the 2014 offensive.~~
EDIT: Actually they are BM-27 Uragans which are smaller 220mm missiles with half the range. Props to /u/RamTank for catching this. 

Then we have seven BM-21 Grad issile launchers in the middle - the ones with 40 short tubes in a box each - which shoot 122mm rockets at maximum of 40km.  The ammo is very cheap and they are the most common annoyance. Used extensively by all sides - Russia, Ukraine and the rebels.

Then on the top left you have six 2S7 Pion howitzers on transporters (because they are heavy and long ) Those are huge 203mm guns which shoot 100kg shells at up to 40km without rocket assisted projectiles - then they go up to 60km. Those things are also damn accurate for big guns, much better than M110s for example.  The fun thing about shooting those things is that first you have an automatic loader because the shell is so heavy and then there's a siren that warns you because the blast is so powerful and loud that you might actually get a concussion.  

On the top right you have a bunch of 2S3 Akatsiya howitzers which are short-barrel 152mm guns with relatively short range - less than 20km - because of the barrel. Not very good and obsolete but the ammo is the same for all the 152mm guns so you take what you can. Russians are mostly using newer 2S19 Msta self-propelled howitzers but some reserve units still have 2S3s and there are more in storage.

That one truck-mounted howitzer is a new prototype with 2A65 Msta gun which has a range of twice that of 2S3 and three times with RAP.  Not sure what it's doing there, probably for export if anyone is interested?

And then  at the very front on the right there are six of what looks like the light 2S1 Gvozdika's which are light 122mm howizters. Very common since they used to be the regimental artillery in Soviet divisions (152mm was division artillery and 203mm was army artillery). They shoot as far as the 2S3s but the ammo is very cheap and is smaller so if you don't need heavy barrage the 2S1s are preferred over 2S3s.  Everyone uses them and they are very popular worldwide. They also have an interesting property thanks to the chassis which is based on the MT-LB transporter - they are amphibious which means that if you have 2S1s and MT-LBs as ammo carriers and command vehicles you don't have to worry about getting across rivers and such and in general you handle well in rough Russian/Ukrainian terrain. Fun thing about those things - they are so light (for a self-propelled howitzer) that every time they shoot it almost feels like they are about to fall apart. But they don't.

The disparity in my criticism is not due to a bias, it's due to how each country stands up to the standard I set for treatment of its gay citizens. 

Thirdly, my standard is partly set by emotion, yes, but also by what is objectively better for the wellbeing and equal treatment of all people. 

Fourthly, I don't read American news more than my own, why would you make that assumption? I don't watch BBC or CNN. They're not very popular in Ireland.

Fifthly, I don't think any country or any people are ""evil"". I don't really believe in evil. My view is that everybody is doing what they think is right, whether it has a good outcome for others and their well-being or not. I favour treatment that maximises well being.

&gt; The notion of them marching onto a conflict in their current situation is shaky at best, very unlikely imo.

Because the war was over at that point. Milosevic was ready to sign the peace treaty, and NATO just needed to facilitate an offensive in order to make the Bosnian Serb leadership come to the table. 

I don't think there was ever an intention to go beyond that, and that had to be clearly communicated. 

&gt;Not to mention that both EU and NATO would support Croatia and BiH.

Unless Russia can keep them out. It's not the nineties anymore. 

&gt;Croatia's policy towards BiH over the past 15-20 years was and is purely a supportive one, Croatia repeatedly guaranteed the territorial integrity of BiH and has no interest in carving it up.

Serbia is supportive on paper as well. 

I don't really buy this, and if shit hit the fan, I'd expect Croatia to grab what they can, like they attempted last time. The loyalties of Croats in Bosnia are clear, and it's not to BiH in its current state.

We can experiment with new AND we can follow the manners of the ancients. As long as we do it in an organized manner with the respect to a regional context.

And yet you condemn a huge group of peaceful counter-protesters and deny the legitimacy of their registered and just as legal protests based on unverified reports of alleged violent incidents by a small subgroup which may or may not be associated with the legal counter-protests, and which may be as harmless as some empty plastic bottles being thrown at police.

Sure I agree, but I'm just trying to make sense of what you're saying. Are you saying the Dacian kingdom didn't exist, the Roman conquest didn't happen or what? It just makes no logical sense. 

If you admit both happened (don't think there is controversy on that, there are Dacian and Roman ruins in the country, historical records of Dacia as a province and the wars to make that happen, Trajan's column in Rome commemorating it) then where did the Dacians go during the Roman period?

[Alexander the great and the history of Globalisation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41345992)

&gt; No single individual has so many cities named
after him or her in the eastern hemisphere.
(Columbus, probably, may have a similar claim in
the western hemisphere). In India alone, almost
every state has cities named after Alexander
(pronounced Sikandar). Some of the famous cities
named after Alexander are Alexandrupolis in
Greece, Alexandria in Egypt (where Alexander is
buried), Iskandria in Afghanistan, Alexandria in
Iraq (on the Tigris river), Alexandria in Pakistan (on
Chenab), Iskenderum in Turkey, Golâshkerd in
Iran. The list goes on and on. There is a town in
India (now in Pakistan) named after his horse
Bucephalus. The town is now known as Phalia.
Alexander rode the horse across Asia. 

__________________________________

&gt; The most intriguing aspect of Alexander was his
vision of globalization and bringing people of all
races together. Alexander the Great conquered and
integrated almost half the world before his death at
the age of 33. His motto is summed up in the
following passage, “All mortals should live like
one, united, and peacefully working towards the
common good. You should regard the whole world
as your country, a country where the best govern,
with common laws, and no racial distinctions. I do
not separate people, as many narrow-minded others
do. I am not interested in the origin or race of
citizens; I only distinguish them on the basis of their
virtue. For my part, I consider all, whether they be
white or black, equal.”

http://thethinkclub.com/2010_Oct/perspective_alexander.pdf

It is not by chance, that Alexandria still bears his name in Egypt. It is not by chance that north Macedonia, has statues erected of him, from a city that he did not even come from.

3497,"It is easy to point fingers to islam, west or anything but the fact of the matter is, by nature, it was doomed to be this way. There are several factors.

First of all, although its a cliche, these countries are not ""real"". Iraq , for example, as a country never existed in history. The term was used only in agricultural and taxation matters in ottoman archives. Ottomans ruled modern day iraq in three provinces: Basra, baghdad and musul. All were distinct from one another in religion, economy and power structures. Today's Iraq is(was) exactly divided in the same three lines, simply because thats the natural divison. Same goes for Syria as well. There was a Aleppo governate and a Damascus governate. Lebanon did not exist. It is the name of a mountain. Even libya, was three different regions. Cyreneica, Fezzan and Tripolitina. Romans used it this way, caliphate ruled libya this way, ottomans ruled it this way. Today the lines almost exactly copy that divide. What I am saying is, from the get-go, the was harder than it had to be.

Secondly, there was a major power vacuum and a power struggle. It was not under any actor's hegemony, and countries or/and tribes started to compete for that hegemony, for resources, for influences, for natural barriers etc. Just like how Europe fought each other for centuries over the hegemony of europe, middle east was and still is trying to settle that. In this climate, errors are lethal. US can say we shouldn't have gone to war in Vietnam and they will be fine but mistakes like that are direct threats to countries' existences. No room for mistake leds to fear &amp; paranoia. Overt measures and extreme responses create victims.  And generations full of hate, resentment and division. Long and complicated history of the region makes everything messier. On top of everything, unlike europe during the last 500 years, there are outsiders interfering in the ""game"". Favoring, supporting and interfering etc. 

Third, Most of these regions have not ruled themselves for almost 1000 years. Arabic culture is very hostile against any resemblances of central authorities. Except for the Prophet's rule, there were always some faction or some tribe, dissatisfied/rebellious towards the authorities. State tradition in a culture is important. It is natural to some cultures, it is absurd to others. Population was alien to submitting towards some king or a president. 

Ideological godfather of political islam and a very important figure in muslim brotherhood, Sayyid Qutb, wrote a book. In his book, there is a line that I always found a very good representetive of arabic/islamic culture: ( paraphrasing ofc )

 &gt; It is obvious to us, Muslims, there is but one god and that is Allah. A muslim should not worship any god but Allah. Then why obey any authority but that of the Allah ? 

In the book, he denounces and criticizes kingdoms, republics, Feudal systems, communism and nation states. Only a caliph tasked with the duty of ""managing"", not ""ruling"" in accordingly to Allah's will can and should be acceptable for muslims. 

Already weak foundations for States, coupled with poverty, conflict and corruption, lost legitamcy in the eyes of their peoples as this ideology spread.

Check out the countries that Brits have left.

IANAL, but from reading the article, I would say legally no.

So, how much do your trust your family to honour your text message once you are gone?

The client's correct response would be telling the butcher to fuck off, because the butcher's primary economical goal should be selling meat, not robbing his clients of their privacy.

My point is that this is not about the agreement between a site and the visitor, but there not being an agreement between the visitor and the thousand of third party services that the website includes in its stack for reasons that are all but technically necessary.

The architectural community is therefore never going to promote any style evocative of pre-modern design, because this would undermine their most intrinsic theoretical beliefs. 

It's wasn't so much a cost issue as an intellectual and artistic shift. Several decades before modernism-proper took off, the mass-production and even (in some cases) prefabrication of architectural elements was taking place. I know in certain larger cities (like Vienna, Prague, Budapest, and Berlin) buildings could even be ordered from catalogues. If you're ever in these cities, I challenge you to walk around and really concentrate on the late-19th/early-20th century apartment blocks. After a while it becomes clear that many have the same essential template — they've just been customised. Some are even identical bar their colour (I noticed this a few times in Prague/Budapest, even with some very intricate buildings).

The EU hasn't just suggested it as an option its currently blocking talks until the UK agrees to it. 

&gt; at no time did we even so much as suggest that there could be a circumstance where British citizens would be expelled. 

Nether has the UK. 

&gt; We commited to this from the beginning

No the EU did not it refused to make to a legal commitment on citizens instead insisting a commitment would only be made as part of a final deal, despite the UK asking for a binding agreement to be made immediately to so that peoples futures wouldn't be dependent on the outcome of talks.  

&gt;Your damn former foreign minister is currently campaigning for a no deal Brexit. 

Hes saying he prefers a no-deal exit over agreeing to the EUs ultimatum, which is the UK stays in the EU but with no vote or the UK breaks the GFA and only NI stays in the EU potentially restarting the troubles and devastating NI economy, both of those options are worse than no-deal, so while its not a great option its the only realistic option currently available to the UK, unless the EU changes its stance. 

The outcome preferred by the UK is the same as its been since the start of talks a CETA style trade agreement along with mobile custom patrols directed by CCTV tracking system to avoid physical infrastructure on the Irish border.

3912,"Greeks, like other Christians, were also made to pay the jizya, or Islamic poll-tax which all non-Muslims in the empire were forced to pay instead of the Zakat that Muslims must pay as part of the 5 pillars of Islam. Failure to pay the jizya could result in the pledge of protection of the Christian’s life and property becoming void, facing the alternatives of conversion; enslavement or death.

Like in the rest of the Ottoman Empire, Greeks had to carry a receipt certifying their payment of jizya at all times or be subject to imprisonment. Most Greeks did not have to serve in the Sultan’s army, but the young boys that were taken away and converted to Islam were made to serve in the Ottoman military. In addition, girls were taken in order to serve as odalisques in harems.

These practices are called the “tribute of children” (devshirmeh) (in Greek παιδομάζωμα paidomazoma, meaning “child gathering”), whereby every Christian community was required to give one son in five to be raised as a Muslim and enrolled in the corps of Janissaries, elite units of the Ottoman army. There was much resistance to this. For example, Greek folklore tells of mothers crippling their sons to avoid their abduction. Nevertheless, entrance into the corps (accompanied by conversion to Islam) offered Greek boys the opportunity to advance as high as governor or even Grand Vizier.

Opposition of the Greek populace to taxing or paidomazoma resulted in grave consequences. For example, in 1705 an Ottoman official was sent from Naoussa in Macedonia to search and conscript new Janissaries and was killed by Greek rebels who resisted the burden of the devshirmeh. The rebels were subsequently beheaded and their severed heads were displayed in the city of Thessaloniki. In some cases, it was greatly feared as Greek families would often have to relinquish their own sons who would convert and return later as their oppressors. In other cases, the families bribed the officers to ensure that their children got a better life as a government officer.

No. But that was not my point. It matches neither my conclusion nor my premise.  

* I was not ""judging all Muslims"". That was not the conclusion I was going for at all. 

* As for the premise it was not just two. My example shows that its a substantive amount. Because in the demographics of Muslim NHS staff  (which there's no reason to believe to be more fundamentalist than average) was resistant enough to the rules, that they had to be changed.

There is no cost to throughput other than initial infrastructure cost and maintenance. Occasionally network can get overwhelmed but you don't have to proactively throttle users at fixed amount used in certain period. You just dynamically adjust per real usage and plan for long term infrastructure upgrade in area that's often having issues.

Proactive throttling done by providers is a scam, a money grab. Dynamic throttling if actual resources are truly used up is fine. But it's never as severe as throttling to 1 Mbps they do, and more importantly - it goes back to high speed immediately after rush hour.

Highway is usually a good analogy to explain how networking works. During rush hours you have to go slower until city planners expand roads network, because roads are packed.

4184,"&gt; Cyprus has a huge Greek population **today** not **once upon a time**. Even with the illegal settlers, turks on the island are still just a minority.So I'm not sure what you're talking about.

One that wouldn't be for an annexation, so be my guest.

&gt; Dude threats about partition will have no value if we are already at war. The only reason that there are negotiations today is because we all want to avoid war. If we are already at war empty threats about ""turkey invading"" and ""partition"" will have no leverage anymore. Saying that a few thousand turks on an island with 80% greeks will be able to achieve partition while greece and turkey are already at war is kind of ridiculous.

You're aware that you can't annex the island if the island is partitoned? If the island gets reunited, any annexation threat would be ending up with the same stuff at the end of the day.

&gt; I'm assuming you wanted to say ""since if Turkey doesn't attack Cyprus"". What I meant when I said that ""cyprus will follow"" was that after greece, there is no way that turkey won't attack cyprus too. 

Turkey won't be attacking Greece, but in any case, they won't be having a war with Cyprus. necessarily if they happen to have a war with Greece.

&gt; It's kind of naive to believe that after they attack greece, turkey will leave cyprus alone. As for what you said (""I doubt if any Greek Cypriot would go and side with Greece""),you are delusional if you think that greeks of cyprus won't side with greece in a potential war (and the other way around).

Turkish Cypriots won't be siding with Turkey if Turkey attacks to somewhere, and I doubt any Greek Cypriots would if Greece attacks to some place aside from the little Hrisi Avgi charter there.

4194,"A person from Niedersachse will be able to tell you more, but from what i understand back when Germany was not a united country and a bunch of duchies, cities, the Duchy of Hannover was the hegemonic power in Niedersachsen, while Braunshweig resisted as a Free City/Duchy with a major trading position. 

Hannover eventually became a more effective administrative and trading center, dwarfing Brunswick (I cant spell it in German anymore) - they even formed what is now the British royal family. That is until the industrialisation of the region, which was either late 19th century or during the WW1-WW2 war industrialisation, that helped Brunswick overtake Hannover. Since then Brunswick and Hannover have effectively competed with each other for industry (VW), and the federalisation of West Germany meant Hannover grew into its administrative capital and HQ/Services city where the upper classes of Lower Saxony reside while Brunswick, due to the effect of the Iron Curtain and then outsourcing, is now still seen as depressed industrial working class.

4329,"&gt;That's really dumb if Spain said that. If Scotland got its independence legally recognised as such by the UK - they would be really dumb to not let Scotland in, since the rest of the EU would hate them for that.

The most important thing to Spain is Catalonia. Even if independence was achieved fully legally that would show the Catalans there's a chance. Give support to Scotland by letting them join the EU and you'll put pressure on yourself to give Catalonia a similar referendum. 

&gt;As for Kosovo - I really don't know if Serbia would or wouldn't recognise it as a prerequisite for joinning the EU. As for 'there's no such prerequisite' - it's only for the public, I don't think the west would let Serbia join without recognising Kosovo.

I'm really not sure.

It is also a part of Islam that socially discriminate against women in general, and by upholding this Islamic religious behavior, the court accepts and help uphold Islamic discrimination of women.


It's a classic example of the paradox of tolerance.

4363,"mainly the western countries that did not take turkish migrants back in the day. the international voting map kind of sheds a light on this but it is not 100% accurate because the turks escaping from the erdogan regime generally like to integrate and tend to not go for a vote. if you look at the data from the netherlands for example you clearly see that participation was low among the younger voters because they are integrating much better than the first generation of migrants. 

https://i.imgur.com/j8udOHk.png

This new so called ""secular exodus"" is a new phenomenon starting with the park protests which is ripe for more analysis. The first Turkish migrant workers to the continent were from rural areas, they were poorly educated and many of them had their  first exposure to urban life in their new countries. 

This new migration wave however consists of the upper crust of Turkish society, most of them hold more than one degree and they move to Europe as highly skilled workers, investors or grad students. Its a textbook example of brain drain caused by the idiotic policies of the Erdogan regime. These Turks dont cause any commotions, they want to integrate and most importantly their main motivation for immigration is personal freedoms not economy. 

You wont see a panic here because it is a win for Europe, most of these people dont even identify as muslims and they are fierce when it comes to democratic values and they generally want to be a productive member of society rather than leeching off from social benefits.

You didn’t actually explain anything, you just said that privacy is a human right and therefore cannot be used to buy things.

It’s just an appeal to emotion that the term ”human rights” is supposed to evoke.

4466,"It's good money, but it's not good business. It has no long term sustainability, fluctuates like crazy and cannibalizes everything else. 

The worst part is that the tourists themselves are a big downside for other tourists. Growth is capped and the industry tends to be seasonal.

You can try going more high end, but the number of high end tourists is very limited. You can hike prices, but this inevitably hurts your numbers. You can try and extend the tourist season, but that's usually dictated by when workers take their holydays so there's not much you can do. 

Mind you, anyone who can profit from it now really should. This is something individuals can't influence outside the voteing booth so by making things worse you may end up making them better in the long run. It is however critical that you never become dependant on tourism income. The inevitable crash is going to ruin so many people on the Croatian coast, it's not even funny.

People set them selves up for failure, living so far above their means that many need new tourism records every year just to not fall behind on morgages and loans. The marginally smart ones at least just overexpand their holdings, buying new property and running them as LLCs. The not so smart ones add on lifestyle expenses like a bigger home, a boat and multiple high end cars.

I genualy want to slap people who think taking out a loan against your immobilia to fund a second brand new BMW or Mercedes is a good idea. Of course, why wouldn't you want to tie your livelyhood to a rapidly depreciating asset that loses 40% of it's value in 18 months. Yes, that's a bigger hit than most people will take doing anything other than gambling, but just think about how good it feel for the first few weeks before you get used to it and it starts feeling like owning any other car.

I think I went a bit off topic, but it's all part of the same problem.

While buildings around her get bombed she continues on with her life as if nothing has happened and no one seems to get through to her. She always gets home to sleep instead of leaving the city. At the end her unit is the only one left standing on the street. And as she is looking for food outside her unit her husband comes walking down the street telling her the war is over.,Europe,/r/europe/comments/989scx/dortmund_before_and_after_wwii/e4ek3kj/,JurijFedorov,1534589727

I was completely surprised by the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. I consider this to be the greatest misfortune in our current situation. It did not have the slightest chance of success, and it exposed not only our capital, but also this part of the country, under German occupation, to new terrible repressions. (...) It seems that no one honest and blind has had the illusion that what happened will happen, it is that the Soviets will not only help our beloved, heroic Warsaw, but they will wait with the greatest satisfaction and joy until it spills out bottom the best blood of the Polish Nation.
I have always been, and all my colleagues in the Corps think that at the moment when the Germans are clearly falling, when the Bolsheviks are just as hostile to Poland and destroying our best people as in 1939 - the uprising would not only make no sense at all but it was even a crime.
Of course, it is clear that there are no words that would express our highest admiration and pride for the heroism of our Home Army and the people of the capital. We are with them every pulse of our blood. We experience deeply this tragedy and our helplessness right now to help them. All our battles from Monte Cassino through Ancona to the Goth Line seem small to us in the capital.

4681,"&gt; This is ridiculous. The EU generally reflects the interests of northern Europe, not Germany. If it would reflect the interests of only Germany it would collapse.

Ok, so it reflects the interests of a region that you're the biggest power in? Of course the EU does not reflect the interests of Germany only, there are member countries in the EU whose interests almost fully allign with those of Germany, so obviously Germany pushing for its own interests indirectly means pushing for their interests as well.

And yes, you are right that the direction of the EU is not fully determined by Germany. Germany is simply not strong enough to be able to do that, however it is the strongest member states by far. So it does have the strongest position to push for its own interests. That certainly isn't imagination, that's just the reality. The likelihood that you will ever find yourself strongly at odds with the EU is small compared to other member states, because compared to them, you have bigger chance to alter the EU position from within so that it's not too at odds with you.

&gt; I could well imagine Saxony's alligning more with Czechia than with Schleswig-Holstein which in turn alligns more with Denmark (certainly Sleswig does).

Sure, Germany is a country with relatively big regional differences. The voting patterns and the satisfaction with the EU/euro does not seem to differ that much though, except for the former Eastern German states of course.

&gt; I also can't help but think that some of it is imagination. The statistically most pro-EU people are the Poles and the statistically least pro-EU people are the Czechs. Clearly their interests are the excact opposite (except they're not).

Go to Poland and ask random people whose country's interests does the EU reflect the most and you will get the same answers as in Czechia. Yeah, statistically people in Poland are more pro-EU. They connect the EU with personal benefits more so than Czechs, because they use the freedom of movement way more than us, and their officials are also more skilled in using the EU funds efficiently. They also tend to be less of a grumpy cynics compared to us.

However you should not take one statistics, asking one simple question about the EU and use it to make a full picture of Poles' attitudes towards the EU. Poles on one hand will say they like the EU but at the same time they will fully support its government's decision to reject MENA refugees. They will say they like the EU, but at least PiS voters will back their government in the feud over the indepedence of the judiciary. PiS can literaly cause a full, open head-on collission with the EU without it significantly affecting their ratings. Perhaps this could show you a more nuanced picture of the Polish attitudes towards the EU. Sure, they like it, they know it brings benefits to them and their country, but they aren't some support ethusiast EU supporters. At the same time, we here in Czechia do not hate the EU with a burning passion. Just because I'm Czech does not mean that when I say some critical about the EU, it is made up. Honestly I didn't even mean it as criticism.

I just said that Germany is a powerful state and as such has the biggest chance to shape the EU to its liking. More or less of course. Germany does not always fully succeed, but has the biggest potentional to do so. As a result, the EU works in German interest and so Germans are happy with it.

Then again, as I have already said, there is no perfect measure for this and it is always subjective. I think you and I agree on this.

Lack of large scale reaction by the Swedes? What are you even talking about? Thw Swedish Democrats have gone from being non-existent in the parliament to 25% support (potentially biggest party in Swesen). All other parties have also a harsher stance on immigration than before. If that's not a reaction I don't know what is, or do you expect Swedes to go around and murder immigrants?? No, (most) immigrants came here legally, and so to stop the influx of immigrants you do it in a democratic way through voting.

When it comes to the USA vs Sweden comparison, the cultural is a lot different between let say Syrian refugees than beteeen Mexicans and people living in texas (where the primary languahe is actually spanish).

the understatement of the year. The goal is quite obvious, to bully independent bureaucratic institutions into conformity and to staff them with political goons. Well functioning bureaucracies put checks and balances on governments, and this is not something these populists want to deal with. 

It's the same thing the Polish government attempted to do with their courts, or The Trump administration does when it staffs EPA with climate change deniers.

Farah Alhajeh, 24, was applying for a job as an interpreter in her hometown of Uppsala when, for religious reasons, she placed her hand over her heart instead of shaking the hand of her male interviewer.

In the first judgement of its kind, the Swedish labour court ruled the company had discriminated against her.

Farah Alhajeh had tried to avoid any upset in the interview by greeting both men and women by placing her hand over her heart.

A Swedish Muslim woman whose job interview was terminated when she refused to shake hands with a man has won compensation.
Farah Alhajeh, 24, was applying for a job as an interpreter in her hometown of Uppsala when, for religious reasons, she placed her hand over her heart instead of shaking the hand of her male interviewer.

In the first judgement of its kind, the Swedish labour court ruled the company had discriminated against.

The company had argued her actions contravened their requirement for staff to treat men and women equally.

Ms Alhajeh would have provided interpretation services via telephone or video, The Local reported, and would not have had to meet customers face-to-face.
The office of Sweden’s discrimination ombudsman argued she had tried to avoid any upset in the interview by greeting both men and women by placing her hand over her heart.

The company was ordered to pay 40,000 kronor (£3,400) in compensation.

According to the BBC, Sweden’s discrimination ombudsman, which represented Ms Alhajeh, said the judgement had taken into account “the employer’s interests, the individual’s right to bodily integrity, and the importance of the state to maintain protection for religious freedom.”

Sweden’s labour court found Ms Alhajeh’s refusal to shake hands due to religious reasons was protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.

While it said the company was right to demand both sexes be treated equally, it was detrimental to Muslims to demand a greeting in the form of a handshake.

Three labour judges ruled in favour of Ms Alhajeh’s claim, while two voted against.

4767,"""Pain"" is not the best moniker here. 

Hollow point bullets cause very significant tissue damage and pain as they expand when hitting muscle tissue, this in turn means they release all of their energy into the body they're hitting and stay lodged inside. 

From [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_ballistics#Flat_point)

&gt; More effective on lighter targets are the expanding bullets, the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet. These are designed to use the hydraulic pressure of muscle tissue to expand the bullet. The hollow point peels back into eight or nine connected pieces causing it to expand the damaged area. The hollow point fills with body water on impact, then expands as the bullet continues to have water pushed into it. This process is called mushrooming, as the ideal result is a shape that resembles a mushroom—a cylindrical base, topped with a wide surface where the tip of the bullet has peeled back to expose more area to create more drag while traveling through a body. A copper-plated hollowpoint loaded in a .44 Magnum, for example, with an original weight of 240 grains (15.55 g) and a diameter of 0.43 inch (11 mm) might mushroom on impact to form a rough circle with a diameter of 0.70 inch (18 mm) and a final weight of 239 grains (15.48 g). 

Edit: Then you also have fragmentation bullets that fragment upon hitting muscle tissue with each fragment going their own way, hitting organs and whatnot on the way.

4770,"&gt;Normal, yet at highest point in 20 years.

The reason for it being at a highest point in 20 years is that many companies had problems filling their apprenticeship places. One reason is the increasing academisation of the German society.More and more people are getting the  higher education entrance qualification and going to university , while companies are getting more demanding making it difficult for people with no school diploma or a low  grades Haupschulabschluss to get a  apprenticeship position.

This is due to technological change in a lot of sectors. Office skills, that depend on writing,reading and also math skills , are becoming more important. Training somebody who didn't even manage to finish school or just very badly is becoming more difficult.

&gt;Well then, do these trainees earn living wage? Where's that data? If you'd be so kind…

Normally these average salaries are not posted for apprenticeship in general, but rather it is listed sector specific. Around 840€ was a general average I could find from 2015. You can't live from that in big cities in Germany, but the Ausbildung is not necessarily  planned to earn a living wage. It is education not a job. Don't forget that a apprentice has to go to school 2 days  of the 5 day work week.  As a student you also don't get a salary in Germany. You normally are entitled to support from your parents while doing your first apprenticeship and if that is not the case or not possible you can get support from the Government.

EDIT:

For refugees the Ausbildung is quite attractive, because it opens the possibility of getting a residence permit.

if you want data you can search for it yourself. Quoting the Article is not enough reading up on the system. ",,/r/europe/comments/988kt0/migrants_help_german_firms_fill_training_vacancies/e4eejv9/,s4mv1m3Z,1534577197

Hungary managed to go from 1st or 2nd (I am not sure if they surpassed Czechoslovakia, and I don't count East Germany) country in GDP per capita in former communist block to being 3rd last among former communist block countries which joined EU. For eg. Poland had half of the gdp per capita of Hungary around 1990. Slovakia and Baltic states were dirty poor also. 

So I am not sure who is committing ""suicide"" here. Especially considering that Hungary votes for cleptocratic leader which fills pockets of his cronies on Ukrainian scale.

And I know your strategy perfectly: every 5 days you delete all your reddit contributions, so that nobody can ever bring to light what you wrote. In the same way you will also erase this very message. What makes me regret having to waste time with you here. You don't mind writing any nonsense, knowing that you will erase it.

&gt; You know full well there weren't Catalan flags because independentists had their own ""celebration"".

As I said in other comments, there were indeed alternative manifestations to this of the Spanish king. And by the way, as you might know, those other ceremonies managed to gather many more attendees than this one of the king that basically concentrated Spanish nationalists only.

The Catalan flag is the flag of all Catalans. Used by all Catalans. The fact that only Spanish flags were seen there gives you a clue to understand what kind of public was there.

Having said that, some few neutral Catalans and Catalan separatists did come. Without a flag, without insulting or attempting to boycott the act as the others did. What should have been the normal thing. But they couldn't enjoy the event normally because of those nationalists. [Here](https://twitter.com/superwomanroja/status/1030376903612538881) you have two independentists: mother and son insulted by a group of Spanish nationalists.

&gt; I guess a picture of a couple women laughing is enough to prove people were there as a celebration of the monarchy.

Curious that you mention this.

Those women who wear the cap with the Spanish flag literally [went to sell those hats right there](https://twitter.com/Yo_Soy_Asin/status/1030403854075080704), setting up a table in the middle of the event. In that image you can also see how the Spanish television interviewed them. They have the nerve to say the following: ""I criticize the separatists that today is not flag day"". Yes, she says that while wearing a hat with the flag of Spain and selling them.

Those are the same hats worn by the unofficial and self-styled ""services of order"" that I mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9868uv/spanish_king_taunted_by_catalan_separatists_at/e4dv3cw/). No one knows who they are or where they came from.

In any case, no. That picture is not the ""proof"". The proof is in the videos of the event, where the behavior of the attendees can be seen. I don't know if you're trolling me, if you don't watch the news or you're just trying to dodge what happened today. Because insults and disrespect are not justified. They took the event to their territory, discrediting the victims. Insulting those who made speeches in Catalan language, etc. I don't even want to repeat all what they did.

&gt; He used his speech to mention the jailed politicians while naming 0 of the victims.

When you lie so blatantly, it's not worthwhile for me to answer.

&gt; I know from your perspective anything Catalans do is great and anything Spaniards do is bad but can you just take a step back and read what you write?

If this law was written 30 years ago opting in via a letter or a phone call might have seen reasonable, and then that law would have been obselete 15 years ago. It might even have stood in the way in the rise of the internet as a platform for some things since it would have been too annoying to opt in the required way for every website you want to visit. And if it never got popular no one might have realized that updating the law was neccesery.

Who can say what new tech or platforms might come along in the next 15 years that requiring a button on a website might stand in the way for. Or the next 50. You could make the law specific to current platforms, but then users of any new ones that come along would be unprotected.

Better to be a bit vague and just require that the user can opt-in/out in a manner that is reasonable for the platform and not a hassle for the user. Then you let the courts decide if a method for a specific platform is reasonable or not. That way the law could still be relevant for a long time to come.

5020,"&gt; that violence

Think about the following scenario. You and your friends with your wife and just with some of your regular group of friends join **another peaceful protest** against the current government.

And you shout your slogans against the system, like being from France you might shout ""Fuck Macron"" or ""Fuck the Party"".

The gendarmes while you were just protesting peacefully start a 4 PM to empty they're tanks of gas in the air and let the gas be carried by the summer wind. And not just one gendarme did this, a lot of them as the Square starts to feel unbearable as you start to cough and your eyes are in tears, you shout more and louder. The fucking gendarmes are cunts and are doing this on porpoise to make you leave, so you shout more and harder. Some in the first line near the fences were hit harder so the crowd stars booing the gendarmes.

And then they start throwing gas cans all around you, one just hit your friend and other friend girlfriend and the smokes stars to disperse. One of your friend is bad, like really bad and another's wife just fell off her feet, as the smoke is unbearable. 

What do you do ? You find them a safe space for them and go shout more or you pick the brick next to you to throw-it at the gendarmes ? A lot did the first one, but there were some that did the ladder. I've seen a friend of mine who's a manager and a nice guy and a stranger to violence, who picked up a slab and threw it at the gendarmes out of spite and hate.

And then they start to use the water cannons and throw more gas cans, 5 minutes later we have grenades blowing around you. You are not familiarized with the ""non lethal grenades"" so you are now even more scared and enraged. If you are around 30 years, it flashbacks they same images you grew up with from the '89 revolution and its aftermath abuse of the government over civilians peacefully protesting as you are doing now.

And in this furious and angered mob, inexplicable they send a fucking battalion of gendarmes cutting the middle of the square. Their action was inexplicable by any civil unrest standard.

Inexplicable they loose two gendarmes on the way, where they were heading and some angered protesters tried to lynch those two gendarmes and they battalion watches from the fences. [Eventually a group of protesters get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQK269QHfLc) them out from the hands of the mob, still the battalion of gendarmes watches from the sidelines.

The gendarmes station is raging that two gendarmes were baldly injured. Then *it was ordered* the square evacuation, and by ordered they just opened the water cannons and started blasting gas all around and they did not did it in a decent civil way, as there were still over 150.000 people in the streets. No, they hunted us on the streets, alleys and where they could find a individual he was beaten just for being there.

Many of the less well off regions are catching up rapidly fast but yes, this has been happening for a longer time already however the correct statement is that smarter, high skill, people may move to prosperous cities or regions. How well off the country as a whole is doesn't really matter that much. Prague is richer than any german region but Hamburg. The rest of Czechia is almost entirely below the level of eastern german regions. Lombardy is up there with Bavaria, Campania is on the level of Estonia. Ile-de-France holds about 12 million people and is the 5ht richest european region (and all 4 richer regions have less than 6 million combined) but most of the remaining France is again not really better of than eastern Germany.

5128,"&gt;Or, I can criticize the IDF, for having policies and practices in place that lead to it being trigger-happy and killing vast numbers of civilians. The issue isn't with just a few rogue soldiers.

Great. I do know a couple experts in all sorts of areas in the IDF (infantry, sniping, demolition, airforce, navy etc) with whom I often talk about policies and doctrine among other topics. I have my own fair share of criticism there, on what policies are outdated, and conversely what policies should be implemented.

For example, my main point of criticism is the inherent flaw in the Hannibal Protocol, how commanders and soldiers alike perceive it, and the ramifications on their way to the solution, due to false perception of the intentions of the protocol.

What policy or policies exactly do YOU think are misplaced or want to talk about?

&gt;Under international law, Israel's possession of Nuclear Weapons is illegal.

I have never heard of that. It would be illegal if it was signatory to the NPT and would obtain nuclear weapons after signing it, but for a long time now Israel has been unable to produce nuclear weapons. And its nuclear ambiguity practically means it does not face the repercussions of being a nuclear armed state.

Can you tell me exactly what law says that Israel's possession is unlawful?

&gt;Also, there are several times that it has been believed Israel did threaten the use of nuclear weapons. Perhaps you consider those threats justified, but that doesn't change the fact that Israel did threaten their use 

You're confusing actual threats with intentions to threaten. In 1967, at the heat of tensions, Israel believed the Arab states would invade, which eventually did happen. It planned to detonate a nuclear weapon in the Sinai. Far enough from any Egyptian city, but close enough to an Egyptian military base to allow them to clearly observe the blast without being harmed themselves so they could report it.

This would deter them to end the war. Of course, there was never a need because the war only lasted six days.

Reading material: https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-planned-to-detonate-atomic-bomb-in-sinai-if-six-day-war-went-wrong/

But Israel has never threatened anyone with the use of nuclear weapons. If it had done so, it would have to give up its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Part of that policy is being unable to make threats.

&gt;Due to the colonies, it continues. Palestinians are slowly being pushed out of their land and into smaller and smaller regions.

Areas A and B and Gaza remain unchanged, and settlements in areas A and B are being demolished if they're ever built.

&gt;So can and do the people of Iran, and yet we sanction them - and for doing far less than Israel has done, and not only in the field of Nuclear Weapons.

Far less? That is BS.

Israel is a democracy, and a peaceful nation. All around it there are wars yet it managed to acquire peace with Egypt and Jordan, and maintain long-lasting quiet with Lebanon and Syria. It is the only place in the middle east that can be called stable. It has greatly contributed to middle east peace by being a stable country, whose only wars with its neighbors are conflicts with proxy groups that don't last more than a month on average, every few years. It is indirectly influencing on other regional states by showing what a democracy can be like, and what having proper, conflict-free relations can do for the quality of life in a country and the economy (read: Egypt and Jordan).

Iran, on the other hand, pursuits nuclear weapons with the declared intent of destroying Israel, the USA, and other countries in the region.

It has funded for many years the world's largest network of terrorism, spanning from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen, to Morocco and even South America, USA, and practically half of Europe.

&gt;Israel needs sanctions, because that is likely to be the only way to force them to withdraw the colonies and revoke their annexation of East Jerusalem, at least within a reasonable timespan.

Those parameters are to be determined in a peace treaty, not via sanctions. Israel already offered to withdraw the settlements and from East Jerusalem, in 2000, but Yasser Arafat rejected that deal. Abbas, many years later said he would probably accept that deal, but that opportunity has passed and a lot has changed in the relations, including Hamas taking over the Gaza strip and waging war on Israel, and the 2nd Intifada that left more than a thousand Israelis dead.

5244,"&gt;Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak and his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire spoke by phone on Friday and discussed U.S. sanctions steps against Turkey, agreeing to act together in response to such moves, the Turkish ministry said.

&gt;The statement said that the two ministers decided to work closely to develop cooperation between Turkey and France and agreed to meet in Paris on Aug. 27.

&gt;Turkey and the U.S. have been locked in a heated crisis emanating from unjust sanctions and the actions of Trump, as Washington levied sanctions on Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gül for not releasing American pastor Brunson, who faces terrorism charges in Turkey.

&gt;Turkey on Wednesday doubled tariffs on several U.S. goods, including alcohol and tobacco products and cars, after Trump increased U.S. tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel imports to 20 percent and 50 percent, respectively.

&gt;U.S. stocks suffered their worst day in seven weeks after the move, and the lira gained 7 percent against the dollar.

&gt;Since the recent developments, a number of countries, including Germany, China, Iran, Italy, and Qatar, voiced support for the Turkish economy and called for a diplomatic solution to the problems between the two NATO allies.

'Fucking one's siblings', as laid out by the ethics council, has no dramatic consequences to speak off, at least in the context of already tolerated procreation. 

There is a difference between a social custom and breaking a law. The incest prohibition is a taboo, it's not prohibited on the basis of consequence, but on reflexive disgust in the same way a taboo against homosexuality was formerly justified. In contrast to holocaust denial which is perceived to be a threat, and thus outlawed, taboos are not sufficient to legally infringe on individual freedom.

XIII ([Enciclopedia Catalana](https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GDLC-e00072161.xml))

Apparently, *Winidhĭld* translated was [Guinidilda d'Empúries](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinidilda_d%27Emp%C3%BAries), original of Flanders.

If this was coding or database design, you would look at the similarities between the popups and decide that they are so similar that this setting should probably be a browser setting instead. That'll be a tough fight though, as the companies are based on those data the brokage of it while serving you personalized ads. So things has to change, for the good of everyone.

It was originally proposed to have a circle of 15 stars for each member, but due to the controversy over recognising the Saar Protectorate as sovereign they settled for a permanent 12 stars with the argument that it'd represent perfection instead.",,/r/europe/comments/9827o7/construction_sheet_of_the_european_flag/e4d2gri/,AccDoesntCheckOut,1534525184

&gt; ""The order was called ""On the liquidation of Polish sabotage and espionage groups and units of the POW"" (POW stands for Polish Military Organization, Polska Organizacja Wojskowa)""

My god, you truly believe Soviet Propaganda. Look at this part of the linked article:

The following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish operation, as described in Soviet documents:

1. ""Active"" members of the Polish minority in Soviet Union (practically all Poles).[3][4]
2. All immigrants from Poland.
3. Political refugees from Poland (mostly members of the Communist Party of Poland).
4. Former and present members of the Polish Socialist Party and other non-communist Polish political parties.
5. All prisoners of war from the Polish-Soviet war remaining in the Soviet Union.
6. Members of Polska Organizacja Wojskowa listed in the special list (most of them were not members of that organisation).* 

140k people in total. I bet all were fucking spies. Makes sense to escape to the country that pretty much cleansed all of the Poles it could reach even pre 1939.

&gt; So an army that lost WW1, was barely holding on in civil war and got defeated by Poles alone would march on entire Europe? Really?

Not on day 1. They probably couldn't march on entire Europe, but certainly could join German communists and fuck some smaller European states.

&gt; Hitler saw entire east as German's land as well. You also wanted to destroy Russia and had plans for an empire spanning all over eastern Europe.

Hitlers approach to Eastern Europe is way more complicated. He knew that Germany has no claim on the vast majority of EE but his philosphhy stated that the stronger takes all.

Private consumers don't even buy the same category of knife from Victorinox, which you'll see in virtually any professional kitchen anywhere and is definitely a usual suspect when it comes to knives.

But the F. Dick a) has a shape I like better and as it turns out b) even though it's the exact same steel, F. Dick seems to be more capable of hardening it than Victorinox. So that's what I bought.

5568,"&gt;The 9 EU regions of England are based on the boundaries of the counties of England, which are well established (even including the 1974 changes), and I intentionally chose those 4 regions above by grouping EU regions together, meaning all of them adhere to long-established county boundaries (many of which have been unchanged in several centuries).


You're making up an arbitrary unit though by bounding together counties and that is something there is little appetite for or identification with when it comes to a serious political level. For example you could bind Scotland and Wales together and call it the ""Celtic"" region. That has logic and is a fusion of two ""well defined"" areas, but it doesn't mean people will fall over themselves to support it especially when it will have such an impact on the country.


&gt;London is already fairly devolved to the GLA - in some areas the most devolved part of the UK except for NI - and that hasn't 'destroyed the concept of England'.


Because that is nothing like federalism. To get your nice even grouping of federal states you would have to butcher up England like you're proposing. That is different from devolution. It means suddenly the regions of the UK will have a very serious constitutional status and power (which they have zero of at the moment on a UK wide level) but England will be nowhere to be seen.


You just cannot force vague fusions of English counties to the same status of distinct nations like Wales, Scotland and indeed England.

Same for marketing options (newsletters, notifications etc).

Data collection that is necessary to run the service does not require consent - only a link to a list of what is collected.

The State, not having the money (or being legally/politically unable to provide it), asked the EU for help. When the State should have just pointed to the contractual clause about modernization being part of the S.p.A.'s responsibilities.

You are saying that this transfer of EU funds is entirely legitimate: As eventually the ownership of the road network will return to the State. I disagree as the company's statute it says that thee company is responsible. So the EU, knowingly or unknowingly, is unjustly financing the Benetton Empire.

You don't scramble jets when someone enters your airspace, you do it before they enter. That's the whole point. Both Russia and NATO often fly missions close to each other's airspace and both scramble their jets to intercept each other. Shooting down any airplane at this point would be an act of aggression. The events when actual airspace violation actually happen are very rear, and even in those situations there are international rules on how those have to be handled. Not following those rules and shooting plane down could also be considered an act of aggression. 

&gt; Instead do what the turks did: Blow the plane to kingdom come.

You do remember that after that, Erdogan apologized, the pilot who actually shot down the Russian jet was thrown in jail, Turkey signed billions of dollars worth of contracts with Russia and Turkey completely changed their allegiances in Syria by joining Russia and Iran in ""Astana process"".

5754,"&gt;The answer will be in the privatization agreement between the State and Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A. From their Statute it says that they are responsible for the construction and management of the road infrastructure and that they are responsible for maintenance, extraordinary repairs, improvements, modernization, enlargement and completion.

Yes.

The construction part is a bit complicated, they built but without right of property on the new built infrastructures.

&gt;In your opinion the bridge is owned by the state, and so would be managed by ANAS.

All the highways are propery of the state, so when concession expired they return to the State.

ANAS is a public company which managed roads for the state, not all roads and without ownership.

&gt;Autostrade per l'Italia only have the responsibility to maintain the bridge. Although from their Statute you can see their responsibility is something more.

Yes maintenance, extraordinary interventions and other services.

&gt;I don't understand the link between your comment about the fact that the EU monitoring the situation and State Aid to private companies is mutually exclusive.

Per se I don't see the state aid, the highways are public property and the past privatization of service was caused by the pressure by EU regulation, the only problem is about extensions of concessions.

EU regulation about state aids is very tight, and indeed Eu recalls Rome for the extensions of concessions, but not for state aids about funds.

By the way I checked the 2,5 bln figure for funds in 2014-2020 and is referred to general roads and railways, not specifically to highways.

&gt;Note: Also since the 90's? Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A was created by privatization in 2002. prior to that date it was part of the State.

When IRI (the public company in charge of transports) was dismembered in the '99 highways were privatized and Benetton take the concession (in a monopolistic way)

In 2002 the society was reorganized in Autostrade spa.

PS: I hate the privatization and Austostrade with passion, I would prefer State managed highways. A sentence about State aids should be the end of the Benetton empire, but unluckily it's not the case.",,/r/europe/comments/97u9e0/eu_hits_back_at_italy_populists_over_genoa_bridge/e4chdsd/,trajanz9,1534503947

5783,"You, my friend, are full of shit. Europe has never called itself “land of the free” like the US has. Europeans have always valued their culture and customs, it’s only in the last few decades that this “political correctness” bullshit has started being shoved down our throats and the majority of people don’t like it, even if they aren’t very vocal about it. 

When I visit a foreign country, I respect their culture and customs. If I go to Japan, I don’t agressively insist people shake my hand. Respecting the culture should be twice as important when moving to a country instead of just visiting. 

What I find the most infuriating is that Muslims especially get a free pass on most things compared to other people. If I go to the UK or Netherlands and show up late for work and tell my boss, “hey, you know in Romania if you are told to show up at 8:00, it’s not a problem if you show up at 8:10”, I would probably get fired on the spot. On the other hand, if you don’t hire a Muslim because they demand to not shake your hand, wear a hijab regardless of workplace dress codes and pray while at work, you are considered a racist piece of shit. 

On top of all of this, why should we show tolerance towards the most intolerant people on this planet. In Japan, if I go inside a building and not take my shoes off, maybe I’d get some weird looks, maybe some old lady would start yelling at me, but that would be the most extreme consequence. In an Islamic shit hole like Saudi Arabia, if you dare to kiss your girlfriend in public you would immediately be thrown in jail. Fuck this.

Don't get me wrong, i think it's foolish. Same way i you may think it's foolish to greet every woman i meet with two kisses on the cheeks. I respect if you don't like it and will not force it upon you, but that is how it is around me, i either kiss you, or i give no physical greet at all. Same way i think is 100% hilarious there are still any religion at all (to me they are all equally pathethic excuses to believe in an afterlife). 

So, in my opinion, if you are not hurting anyone, if you are doing whatever it is you are and you are not hindering your ability to do your job, let it be.

There was nothing out West except some raw materials and rowdy barbarians.

Rome was oriented towards and mostly developed from and developed in Eastern Med/Levant/Anatolia. 

And lastly... Romans themselves believed that Rome was founded by Trojans ... Anatolians/EasternMed. As per the Aeneid and the most sacred ancient Roman religious rites.

5934,"As a first step, I think there needs to be a reframing of what we mean with moderate Muslims and extremists.

A lot of Muslims (and their ""supporters"") appear think that extremism is only about terrorism, and anyone who is peaceful is a moderate.

The reframing is this: If you think, for example, that apostasy should be punishable, you're an extremist. If you think homosexuality should be punishable, you're an extremist. If you think blasphemy should not be allowed, you're mostly certainly not a moderate.

Make it so that the narratively ""average""  Muslim is one who is as extreme as the average citizen of the country is. Anyone more extreme is an extremist, and more moderate is a moderate. Right now, it seems that Muslims who should be classified as extreme are seen as average, and Muslims who should be seen as normal are moderate.

Once everyone is on the same page about extremism, we can really start to talk about it and address it.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/97v0um/mosque_sermon_called_for_armed_jihad_a_sermon_at/e4cac8r/,Aarros,1534489666

Dropping houseprices might favour the older generation a bit, but since they're older, it also means the house you might inherit as a child of said generation will be worth less.
