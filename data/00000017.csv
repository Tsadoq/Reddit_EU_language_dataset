&gt;Dexclaimed at the start of the health crisis, Boris Johnson was finally able to make the British vaccination campaign an example. While the strategies applied to deal with the health crisis have been significantly different in France and in the United Kingdom , what opinion do the French have of the British Prime Minister?

&gt;First of all, the British Prime Minister has a very high notoriety rate - 85% - among the French. It is in particular very well identified by retirees and by executives and upper intermediate professions. This strong notoriety is certainly explained by the atypical personality of the former mayor of London and his leading role during the Brexit campaign as well as during the negotiations to leave the European Union that followed.

&gt;The champion of France from below

&gt;Of all French people, 51% say they have a good opinion of Boris Johnson. An important score which, if he was a French politician, would place Boris Johnson the fourth favorite personality of the French. He would thus be the fourth and last political figure to exceed the 50% favorable opinion mark, behind Nicolas Hulot., Édouard Philippe and Roselyne Bachelot. This popularity rate is all the more impressive as the personality of the head of the British government is considered to be very divisive. A closer analysis of his popularity also indicates the existence of favorable opinion reserves (Boris Johnson could have been more popular if he had been better known). Indeed, we note that the socio-professional category having the most favorable opinion of him (63% of good opinion) is also the one with which he has the lowest notoriety (79%): the working classes.

&gt;TRIBUNE. The eccentric British Prime Minister succeeded, in particular thanks to the success of his vaccination strategy, to seduce the French ""from below"".

&gt;From the point of view of partisan sympathy, Boris Johnson seems to aggregate the support of Christophe Guilluy's peripheral France. It obtains its best scores among supporters of the National Rally (60% good opinion, including 13% very good), Republicans (59% good opinion) and La France insoumise (55% good opinion). These results are consistent with Boris Johnson's electoral successes during the 2019 legislative elections , where the Conservative Party managed to keep its strongholds and conquer constituencies strongly anchored to the left. Conversely, it fails to appeal to urban populations with a high level of education. Boris Johnson thus collects 57% of bad opinion in the Parisian agglomeration and 64% among graduates of higher.

&gt;A proactive management of the health crisis

&gt;Regarding the management of the health crisis, 74% of French people believe that the British leader has managed the crisis as well or better than Emmanuel Macron, and nearly a third think that he has managed the crisis better than his French counterpart. A particularly high score when the British Prime Minister advocated the strategy of collective immunity at the start of the epidemic. If the number of deaths per million inhabitants is much higher in the United Kingdom than in France, the success of Boris Johnson's vaccine strategy tends to quickly narrow the gaps and has already made it possible to reopen shops and bars in addition

&gt;The figures from the study also seem to support Boris Johnson's strategy of ""taking back control"" rather than suffering the health crisis. Despite structural flaws, such as a more strained health system in the United Kingdom than in France and the appearance of the English variant, he adopted a clear strategy based on vaccinationto get his country out of the crisis more quickly. Thus, for 54% of Republicans sympathizers, Boris Johnson has managed the crisis better than Emmanuel Macron. It is only among supporters of the presidential majority that Boris Johnson is considered, in the majority (54%), to have handled the crisis less well than the French president. Moreover, it is among the oldest populations and, therefore, statistically, the most at risk, that Boris Johnson's opinions on crisis management are the best.

&gt;Far from the caricatures that are made of it, Boris Johnson has finally managed to seduce a majority of French people by embodying an unusual political line. It is by breaking the codes that he succeeded in conquering social classes disenchanted by politics",,/r/europe/comments/npoudi/boris_johnson_un_modèle_politique_pour_la_france/h066syo/,rose98734,1622535105

The profit margin for each pizza or a kebab plate depending on the places efficiency and ingredients chosen can reach near 80%.

Flour is dirt cheap and provides a large amount of the mass of the pizza along with water. The toppings can be low quality, so shitty less than 10e/kg cheese is bought preshredded. Same with meats, ham is really cheap in bulk, same with salami or any other non fancy cold meat. Ground beef is often used and costs less than 5e/kg raw, this can be baked in bulk in the oven. Some special cheeses can sometimes be found from these profit orientated pizzerias, but the thing is you don't have to use much of them, to be allowed to say there is this topping in the pizza.

Sweden is doing just fine I would say and it's their own policy. So far they seem to be doing ok. So I'm not sure what you are so afraid of.

Maybe it's because not everyone feels patriotism in countries that only exist because of colonialism in the current form. And also it's not always so easily fixed. Economic problems exist often outside of our ability to deal with them. Capitalism is just unfair like that.

So what, are not supposed to care about the casualties of civilians? Also what did you expect an economic cooperation group such as the EU to do realistically? It's not a country with a military and interventionism isn't necessarily a popular model of foreign affairs.

If you think helping people in need will somehow amass to Europeans being replaced then idk what to tell you. No immigrant is assimilating you. And also keeping your own culture close to you is not a bad thing. It's as if you moved from France to Hungary and suddenly you're expected not to speak of your origins or speak your native language or prepare your traditional food. Wouldn't that feel horrible to you? And no it's not as easy as ""you just gotta deal with it"". It's wrong to ask someone to abandon their cultural background just because they moved somewhere. 

Also your sentence ""everything nowadays is racist smh"" perfectly sums up the type of a person you are.

555,"I know you said ""etc.,"" but I'd like to add horse racing. Though that applies to more than just Saudi Arabia.

I know someone who works at a horse farm owned by some billionaire from Dubai. They'll throw millions at horses that might not ever do anything. I've seen people's houses that had worse living conditions than some of those horse's stalls. They had ceiling fans. I live in a wealthy suburb of Washington, DC and I don't even have a ceiling fan.

When they built the farm, they basically bulldozed somewhere around 2,000 acres, reshaped it how they wanted it, built a lake, and transplanted something like 10,000 trees. All the power/phone/internet lines are underground because it would harm the aesthetic.

One time, a member of the rich family was visiting and forgot the three digit combination to the lock on her luggage. It doesn't take that long to go through that many combinations, so an employee just started at 000 and went up until he found it. She tipped him $1,000.

Obviously I've spent a little time around that world and it can be pretty crazy. Nothing against the other sports you mentioned, but at least an F1 racecar has a ton of extremely detailed engineering and testing behind it. A horse could come from an excellent lineage, look great, and still fail miserably. And human athletes can (usually) be reasoned with, trained in more detail, and coached in the same language.

Horses are also pretty fragile and can be very dumb. Horses can't even vomit and they can die from that. Among domesticated horses, colic is the leading cause of premature death.

It's true, we don't want uneducated unskilled immigrants from Africa and the Middle East. You can call it racist or xenophobic, but I think it's mostly due to bad experiences due to culture clashes.

She was imprisoned because she was a suspected Stalinist, simply because she joined the Communist Party before the war. This happened to a lot of prewar communists, including my own grandfather.

My own family suffered because of it, but I can't really blame Tito for saving us from Stalin. And just like Ženi Lebl, my grandfather was cleared of suspicion two years later and released. It was a specific event for specific people in specific circumstances in 1948-1951, not the regular daily life of the Yugoslav population in the 1970s and 1980s when these flats were built.

720,"Emergency brakes, curfews, school closures: Without lockdown measures, infection rates will not fall, politicians believe. Some experts disagree - and are getting new arguments from a recent study by the University of Munich.

While the number of infections in Germany continues to fall, politicians are discussing the relaxation of measures. It is usually taken for granted that there is a direct link between corona measures, such as curfews, mandatory masks or restaurant closures, and the incidence of infection. This is the only way to justify many restrictions on fundamental rights from a legal point of view, such as the ""federal emergency brake,"" against which the Federal Constitutional Court recently rejected several emergency petitions.

Constitutional Court rejects urgent applications against lockdown
This does not mean that it has yet been decided whether and which restrictions are constitutional - this will only be decided in the main proceedings, legal experts emphasize. But many restrictions will remain in place, depending on reported incidence figures, and can be reimposed at any time, even after relaxations, if incidences rise.

However, after a year of the pandemic, there is growing evidence that a causal link between many measures and the incidence of infection cannot always be proven. For example, several U.S. states recently showed that, even after months, neither the number of infections nor the number of deaths increased following the lifting of almost all protective measures, including the mandatory use of masks, and that the number of deaths actually declined continuously.


Corona cases in Bavaria: schools hardly play a role
CODAG LMU Munich Corona cases in Bavaria: schools hardly play a role
In Germany, too, experts had repeatedly stressed that many lockdown measures were not effective. Now, fresh data has come from LMU Munich that supports these theses. Dr. Ursula Berger of the Institute of Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology and statistics professors Göran Kauermann and Helmut Küchenhoff have been publishing data on the development of the Corona pandemic for several months under the title COVID-19 Data Analysis Group (CODAG). FOCUS Online presents some of the findings of the latest study, which was published on May 28.

725,"School Closures
""We see both in the workplace and already in schools the clear effect of rank testing: Mandatory testing, or mandatory testing, initially leads to a jump in Covid-19 cases. In the long term, the incidence figures from outbreaks fall again,"" the experts said. The researchers' conclusions: the tests can detect and break chains of infection. But the experts also clarify, ""Case numbers from outbreaks in schools remain insignificantly low."" Infections in the workplace would have played a much larger role.

Corona outbreak: Did China know earlier than thought?
spot on news Corona outbreak: Did China know earlier than thought?
After the opening of the schools for attendance classes after the Easter vacations, the infections among schoolchildren had ultimately decreased. ""It can be assumed that due to the series testing among schoolchildren, the number of unreported cases in these age groups is close to zero, i.e. in these age groups the incidence of infection is now almost completely reflected by the reporting incidences,"" the experts added.

""More objectivity in the discussion""
Using these data, the researchers see only a minor role for schools in corona spread, similar to data from previous CODAG studies. ""These results may help in the current discussion about vaccinations for school children to prevent infections in schools and contribute to objectification,"" the study states. Although the researchers don't explicitly say it, one can infer: Nationwide vaccination of children, or the requirement of Covid19 vaccination to attend classes, could not be justified, at least with the argument that schools are relevant outbreak sites - because they are not.

Incidence values with limited significance
The federal government's current lockdown measures are directly dependent on certain incidence values. Falling below or exceeding certain thresholds virtually automatically sets in motion certain measures, up to and including general curfews. Many experts, such as the well-known infectiologist Matthias Schrappe, believe that orientation solely on this value is wrong. The Munich researchers also say, ""An evaluation of the infection incidence of the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 in the German general population based on the numbers of reported cases or rates based on them, such as the 7-day incidence, is only possible to a very limited extent due to the varying test behavior.""

""No direct association with measures taken""
The researchers consider the R value to be more meaningful - the reproductive R value indicates how many people an infected person infects on average. It depends little on testing behavior and reported positive results. Here, when comparing the first, second and third Corona waves in Germany, the researchers observed something that does have political significance: ""In the R values, as determined daily by the Robert Koch Institute, there has been no direct correlation with the measures taken since September - neither with the lockdown light on Nov. 2 and the tightening on Dec. 16, 2020, nor with the 'federal emergency brake' adopted at the end of April 2021,"" the report says.

So the federal government's claims that measures such as curfews have no alternative appear to be on firmer footing. ""As of mid-April, the R-value is falling again. The drop is also discernible here even before the 'federal emergency brake', so that the measures taken may well have positively influenced the course of the infection event, but are not solely causally responsible for the decline,"" the LMU study says.

750,"&gt;Dude, you can find Africans and Muslims more culturally similar to you than Latvian rural hicks (or Irish rural hicks).

Seriously, this man hasn't been around the world enough like his namesake Temujin. 

Latvian hicks I find aren't too different from Russian hicks and Russian hicks are pretty fucking different from your average Western European urban citizen. I cannot relate to most Russians anymore, that's one of the reasons I left Russia. You can find a lot of very progressive young people in cities like Tunis, Tehran, Beirut, Damascus, etc on the other hand. 

And plenty of hard-working and educated coastal West Africans, every single person from West Africa that I know living in the States is running a business, hustle is the name of the game for them. I would argue I've seen plenty of Western Euros far lazier than them, the culture of starting a business isn't necessarily that healthy in many EU countries. 

&gt;what does cultural homogeneity mean

You and I and he all know what he meant, it's a dogwhistle.

I am not unsympathetic to the problems Western Europe faces assimilating MENA immigrants, but the right way to solve them is to go along the Canadian immigration system, not some sort of a black and white all or nothing approach of going from mass immigration to zero immigration from a whole swathe of the world. That sort of policy will never be implemented while this world is still maintaining a semblance of stability, and such a policy would make Europe look disastrously fascist and racist. 

You can literally tell 99% of MENA immigrants to fuck off without looking like a racist by creating a points-based system like Canada that only admits the cream of the crop. Which is working splendidly for them. Neither US nor Canada has problems taking in MENA immigration, all they did was limit it and they're fine.",Apparently Serbia according to /u/cLnYze19N,/r/europe/comments/nozlgx/official_eu_conference_on_the_future_of_europe/h03tzmz/,Aemilius_Paulus,1622484851

805,"&gt;You have this weird, dubious impression that Europe has some chronic labour shortages that it is struggling to fill.

This isn't an issue of labor demand; this is an issue of consumption.

Europe needs tax revenue in order to function. That revenue is built on income and domestic consumption, and income is built on both foreign and domestic consumption of European products. Europe *currently* subsists on exports, relying on foreign consumption to bring in enough money for their governments to function.

But you're now looking at a situation where your population moves into retirement en-masse (meaning dramatically increased spending *and* dramatically reduced consumption, as old people don't really consume that much), so you're going to be even more reliant on foreign markets.

But at the same time *the majority of the developed world is similarly aging into mass retirement*, so they're *also* going to be increasingly dependent on nations with good demographics to absorb consumption. Which is basically just the United States, with whom the EU has no trade deals, and which is shifting towards a more protectionist stance with respect to trade.

So the only way out is by boosting domestic consumption, but that in turn requires the presence of the demographic that is responsible for consumption from a global perspective; people between the ages of 20 and 35. You can't afford to wait to naturally produce this demographic, so you need to import it.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/np0nx6/timetodelivermigrationeu_no4_more_legal_pathways/h03e974/,r3dl3g,1622477156

Together with currency exchange, those recent scare stories of arbitrarily denied entry, and whatever hoops my Chinese citizen husband had to jump through, it seems like a non-starter by now.

Those peeps here arguing how this shit is ever so normal for visiting the US or Japan or whatever kinda miss the point IMO. From a European perspective the UK isn't that sort of place.

1055,"It was already the case before. EU Treaties have mutual defence clauses (although it is written in Art 42 that this does not go against neutrality policies).

Nonetheless, only 5 of the EU 27 member states declare themselves to be somewhat neutral but the way this is declared varies from country to country.

Austria is constitutionally neutral after the Declaration of Neutrality adopted in 1955 under pressure from the Soviet Union. This has nonetheless not stopped the country from participating in both the EU's CSDP and PESCO as well as multiple EU Battlegroups

Finland used to be fiercely neutral during the Cold War, due to mainly to the post WW2 context and pressure from the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, this is only considered to be a policy matter and can thus change at any time. And indeed, since 1995, Finland has modified its neutrality to mean military non-alignment allowing the country to join the EU. This non-alignment policy is further rolling back today with an increase of military cooperation with Sweden and the participation in EUBG, EU CSDP and PESCO.

In Ireland, neutrality is also a matter of policy (although it has multiple times be considered to be something that would not be rolled back without massive popular support). That being said, the country is a member of the CSDP and PESCO and participated in multiple battlegroups.

Malta is also neutral and is in fact the only country in the EU to not take part in PESCO or battlegroups without an opt-out. It is nonetheless a member of the CSDP.

Finally Sweden is, like Finland, no longer neutral and has entered mutual defence agreements with the rest of the European Union. It does however continue to behave like a neutral or non-aligned country for most of its foreign policy although that has rolled back over the last few years given the increase in threatening activity from Russia. Sweden is also part of the CSDP, PESCO and various EU Battlegroups.

So ultimately, there are only 3 neutral EU countries who still participate to various degrees in EU security and defence policies

1317,"Battle of Jutland, also called Battle of the Skagerrak, (May 31–June 1, 1916) was the only major encounter between the main British and German battle fleets in World War I, fought near the Skagerrak, an arm of the North Sea, about 60 miles (97 km) off the west coast of Jutland (Denmark).

The battle unfolded in extensive maneuvering and three main engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the North Sea coast of Denmark's Jutland Peninsula.

It was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war. Jutland was the third fleet action between steel battleships, following the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904 and the decisive Battle of Tsushima in 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War. Jutland was the last major battle in world history fought primarily by battleships.

Germany's High Seas Fleet intended to lure out, trap, and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the entire British fleet. This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British blockade of Germany and to allow German naval vessels access to the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Great Britain's Royal Navy pursued a strategy of engaging and destroying the High Seas Fleet, thereby keeping German naval forces contained and away from Britain and her shipping lanes.

The Germans planned to use Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper's fast scouting group of five modern battlecruisers to lure Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty's battlecruiser squadrons into the path of the main German fleet. They stationed submarines in advance across the likely routes of the British ships. However, the British learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely, so on 30 May Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty, passing over the locations of the German submarine picket lines while they were unprepared.

On the afternoon of 31 May, Beatty encountered Hipper's battlecruiser force long before the Germans had expected. In a running battle, Hipper successfully drew the British vanguard into the path of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Beatty sighted the larger force and turned back towards the British main fleet, he had lost two battlecruisers from a force of six battlecruisers and four powerful battleships—though he had sped ahead of his battleships of 5th Battle Squadron earlier in the day, effectively losing them as an integral component for much of this opening action against the five ships commanded by Hipper. 

Beatty's withdrawal at the sight of the High Seas Fleet, which the British had not known were in the open sea, would reverse the course of the battle by drawing the German fleet in pursuit towards the British Grand Fleet. Between 18:30, when the sun was lowering on the western horizon, back-lighting the German forces, and nightfall at about 20:30, the two fleets—totalling 250 ships between them—directly engaged twice.  
  
Fourteen British and eleven German ships sank, with a total of 9,823 casualties. After sunset, and throughout the night, Jellicoe maneuvered to cut the Germans off from their base, hoping to continue the battle the next morning, but under the cover of darkness Scheer broke through the British light forces forming the rearguard of the Grand Fleet and returned to port.  
  
Both sides claimed victory. The British lost more ships and twice as many sailors but succeeded in containing the German fleet. The British press criticised the Grand Fleet's failure to force a decisive outcome, while Scheer's plan of destroying a substantial portion of the British fleet also failed. 

The British strategy of denying Germany access to both the United Kingdom and the Atlantic did succeed, which was the British long-term goal.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/nowemz/this_day_in_1916_battle_of_jutland_begins_the/h021cz1/,capcaunul,1622441867

1514,"&gt;Byzantine confusion during the Battle of Manzikert in which they retreated while winning due to a misunderstanding between the formations. Alp Arslan, the Turkish leader, was so surprised to see his army saved by this retreat that he attributed this event to Allah's intervention. 

No, there weren't really ""misunderstanding between formations"", i mean there was that instance of Romanos charging forward with the center and then retreating because his army was too slow, this did create confusion and gave the impression that they were routing, but this did not cause the Byzantine army to retreat. 

Romanos wasn't that bright of a general and he made tons of mistakes, he divided the army into 4 sections, right flank, left flank, center and the rear. And he made the dumb mistake of giving the rear section's command to his political rival. His job was to support the weakest section during the battle, surprise surprise, when things started to look bad instead of risking it he just retreated. 

Romanos commanded the center terribly, Alparslan's center baited and harassed them and then just straight up ignored them and attack the left flank of the Byzantines who were already engaged with the Seljuk right flank. Romanos was unable to regroup and help the left flank in time, and after Seljuks decimated the Byzantine left flank they surrounded the Byzantine center, meanwhile Seljuk left flank routed the Byzantine left flank and came to help Alparslan surround the Byzantine emperor. This was also the time Byzantine rear retreated instead of helping Romanos. 

Alparslan's army was almost entirely made up of highly mobile horse archers so they were easily able to change positions and surround the isolated Byzantine sections. Byzantines were not experienced with this kind of warfare so they performed very poorly. Would the Byzantine be able to change the fate of the battle if they helped Romanos? Maybe but it is far from certain. If they attacked Alparslan's forces could easily disengage and continue their hit and run tactics whicy the Byzantines had pretty much no counter to. 

Manzikert was hardly a Byzantine retreat, only the remainder of the right flank and the rear managed to retreat. The rest were wiped out along with the elite Varangian guards who made a last stand protecting the emperor. Romanos was taken captive, a peace deal was made and he was released. When he returmed to Constantinople he was tortured and killed by his political rivals who disregarded the peace he managed to make with Alparslan. Needless to say this didn't turn out well. It is safe to say this was the event that led to the collapse of the Byzantine Empire.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/nnf7ao/on_this_day_in_1453_constantinople_falls_to_the/h01gfbs/,ZrvaDetector,1622427800

And that's not to mention that computers have been in full control of lethal systems for decades, like [Phalanx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS).

To be blunt, a blanket ban on computer control of lethal systems is not gonna happen.  No chance.

1622,"The most likely connection is with Dacians however (never heard of a similar custom at nearby Slavs,let alone the fact Slavs themselves are a composed population made up of various people, not just proto-Slavs, and they also adopted customs from others).

The main Getae-Dacian deity, Zalmoxes, is mentioned in ancient writings that was covered at birth with a bear skin for example (thats one possible origin of his name in Getae-Thracian language).

We also know (Mircea Eliade is one of the main historians of religions who mention this) that peoples in this area, before even the first mentions of Dacians in any chronicles, were dressing in wolf skins for example, as part of some warrior initiation ritual in some secret cult.

So, the most logical conclusion, seeing the beliefs behind the custom (chasing the evil etc) and the time period (New Year, ""the birth of a new year"" etc) is that this is related with some ancient Dacian belief related with the birth of Zalmoxis, the begining of a new year and a new life and chasing away the evils that might interfere with it, stuffs like that.

1905,"What you should keep in mind when looking at that map is that many of the motorways depicted there are the aforementioned shit ones with gravel for shoulders that were built post-2010, which are also significantly narrower &amp; have lower speed limits (usually 110kph). Many former motorway plans were downgraded to this, including the desperately needed M8 which would cross the country in an east-west direction bypassing the overcrowded Budapest metro - but yet its construction has stalled since 2010.

Another thing you can see on this map is an utter failure of long-term planning. You have small towns like Pápa with populations equal to a mid-sized BP suburb getting their own highways while the Budapest ringway has been stuck in its current, incomplete state for nearly a decade with no sign of new construction starting on the horizon. Hundreds of thousands of people would be benefited by M0 but instead of building it they've just downsized its plans to a two-lane road &amp; seemingly abandoned it entirely in practice. There was also recently an article that stated M10 (which would replace Route 10, one of the most dreadfully congested roads in the country) will not be built until 2052, despite the fact that by that time the area its supposed to serve will have likely doubled in population.

AKEL presents itself as the continuation of the Communist Party of Cyprus (1926-1944, illegal since 1931). More objectively, AKEL was the creation of the collaboration of underground CPC leaders with members of the moderate/progressive bourgeoisie, similar to the [United Democratic Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Left) in Greece when CPG was made illegal. In both cases: *""initially was meant to act as a substitute and political front of the banned Communist Party, it eventually acquired a voice of its own, rather pluralistic and moderate""*.

Unlike Greece where the CPG eventually was made legal again and returned, in Cyprus the CPC didn't reappear.

2007,"&gt;Reddit isn't a real source, and askhistorians is wrong probably about as often as they are right. Fundamentally its a linguistics question anyway, not history. 

You clearly didn't even bother to read the answer, because the first thing the guy stated was that he had a major in Arabic.

&gt;I can read and write MSA, but I have trouble reading the Qaraan. That should not be the case if the language is ""unchanged"" since 500 CE.

Since you already speak arabic I shouldnt have to tell you this but Qur'an is spelled with a U. I can't find any language that writes Quran with two A:s either. Could you please explain the odd spelling.

And if you can't read the Qur'an, that's probably because of your poor Arabic skills and not the languages fault. Arabic is the MSA. What you probably speak is a dialect of Arabic, and I'm going to guess that you weren't raised in an Arabic country since in that case you would have been taught the MSA in school.

&gt;Also literally nobody speaks MSA, that's not a real thing. Some news broadcasts and academic setting use language closer to MSA, but it is literally never used outside of writing.

MSA is the standard way to speak Arabic. Since it's a widely spoken language with tons of different dialects, the MSA is the standard way for Arabs to communicate without a problem that is taught in schools all over the Arab world. Arabic has been this way for hundreds of years. MSA has never been anyone's native language but it's the part of Arabic that matters the most, because it's the ""official"" version.

2010,"There are two ""oo"" sounds in English, and based on the above transliteration, you might be thinking of the other one, as in ""noose,"" where the ""oo"" is different than it sounds in ""book."" 

But adding an ""r"" at the end makes it a different sound. The ""ir"" in ""hayir"" is more like ""er"" in English and sounds similar to ""higher,"" so that's not a useful example if we're trying to isolate for just the undotted ""i"" sound. 

For comparison, listen to this. The final vowel-consonant combinations in ""book"" and ""findik"" are very similar, and clearly different than the short ""i"" vowel sound in ""pick.""

2021,"I can see what you mean. We have grown immensely as a species, and we have created more and more intricate ways to produce vast amounts of energy - some of which have been abused in the most terrible ways. You may be right that that is the message: don't start thinking too much of yourself, because that may well invite disaster. In such cases a loving parent would warn or stop you.

Of course it would be a mistake to make the story more than it is. As you say, it's a myth to explain all the languages in the world, nothing more. They didn't have our concept of what a god is. They didn't think too much about plot holes and whatnot.

In that sense I'm not serious when I call God petty; we're dealing with a very different set of rules, a different kind of idea about the divine, a different kind of value system and a very different type of story telling. Reading it through a modern lens as if you are analysing the motivations of Thanos from the Avengers movies is just missing the point.

2065,"I partly disagree. Compared to human languages, the language of mathematics precisely defines its meaning, there should be no guesswork.

The axioms and production rules are not arbitrary and are chosen based on the most primitive features of the abstraction. Peano arithmetic is meticulously precise regarding what a natural number is: it's either O or S n, where n is already known to be a natural number. You might ponder on the meaning of O and S and try to find a deeper meaning in them, but from the point of view of Peano arithmetic these are logical constants that we presume exist: O corresponds to the minimal element and S n corresponds to the ""next"" element. Depending on the desired meaning -- O is zero or one -- addition and multiplication are defined in a way that matches our expectations. The O S formalism is the way we write down our ancient understanding of natural numbers as something you count with fingers.

But yes, the meaning we put to mathematical formalism is external from it by nature of the former being in our head and the latter being ""on paper"".

It looks like there are a few people selling (non-costume) cloaks.

My guess is that cloaks aren't as convenient as a jacket and pants at keeping you warm.  When you move in a jacket, you can't accidentally let in air, because the jacket forms to your body.  A cloak has a big slit up the front.

And in a cloak, your arms are encumbered — you have to stick them out the front of the cloak, because it's sleeveless.

If you look at what people *do* wear today, they seem to have sleeves.

* [duster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duster_%28clothing%29)

* [trenchcoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_coat)

* a [poncho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poncho) doesn't have sleeves — your arms come our the ""bottom"", but it's also looser and shorter, so it's not as much of a hinderance.

I am thinking that maybe the trenchcoat was part of what killed the cloak.  The cloak apparently went out of fashion in about the 1930s, and the trenchcoat was a thing starting in the 1940s and was functionally comparable.

https://www.quora.com/Why-and-when-did-cloaks-go-out-of-fashion

&gt;From what I can tell, the last time long cloaks were in fashion was in the 1930s.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Capes and cloaks were a part of the mysterious, almost mystical glamour evoked by 1930s fashion. It was a return to the Victorian era of wearing a cape or cloak as both fashionable and practical protection from the elements.
This outerwear trend was particularly helpful for evening wear styles. Women wore them over their dresses so as not to cover too much of their glory — but most times the cape alone was glorious enough to look at!

-

&gt;But even then the style was more towards semi-tailored capelets and fur-collared coats rather than full-length cloaks. By the early 1900s, cloaks were already considered matronly.

-

&gt;A few possible reasons why cloaks went out of fashion:
&gt;
&gt;* they're perfect for cold weather, since they can hold a warm cocoon of air around you but once you have to put your hands out of the cloak it lets in cold air and you might as well wear a coat, which is much more convenient. Plus cloaks probably get caught in a lot of stuff.
&gt;
&gt;* long coats or capes don't work well in cars or around machinery
&gt;
&gt;* Fabric scarcity maybe? They did go out of fashion before World War II.
&gt;
&gt;* More people started keeping sewing machines in their houses. Sewing machines made it quicker and easier for people to sew more tailored garments in heavy fabrics. So a person could make a cheaper, more practical garment with about the same effort. Jackets, coats and other tailored garments with buttons, pockets and so on gradually took over because of the invention (and increasing improvement) of machines that allow for the quick and efficient weaving, cutting and sewing of such garments. Prior to the late 1700's and early 1800's, cloth was woven on hand looms, and garments had to be hand sewn by tailors/seamstresses, or made at home.
&gt;
&gt;* Capes were very useful when you were driving a coach or had to walk about in the rain. (What is a cape, after all, but a king of poncho?) Drivers would wear capes to protect them from the elements as they drove their coaches and wagons, and toffs would wear them to protect their elegant clothes.

2095,"&gt; I don't see how they are worse then, Erdogan is really religious and Islamic fanatic, he recently built a new mosque in the central square of Istanpol, converted the haya Sofia and also preached Islamic chants from the Quran himself in there, from a western point of view it's insane to think of a leader acting that way this religiously. 

""Western point of view"" that's exactly why many people cannot understand the motives of Erdogan. He is a macchiavellist who keeps his interest above all ideologies. He would be the most Atheist person in Czechia and most Catholic person in Poland. The thing is he was pro-LGBT rights, pro-privatization, pro-freedom of speech until those started to make him lose votes. He was bragging about how he destroyed Turkish nationalism and nationalists. He is in coalition with the nationalist party now and he brags how he saved Karabakh for our Turkic brothers in Azerbaijan. He will do anything that let's him keep the votes. He was in alliance with Gulenists too. He let them purge Kemalists and gain the control of the army. Gulenists became terrorists for him when they started to act against his interests BUT they were always the terrorists for secular Turks. I had no doubt they were terrorists before 2013. They tried to reach me in order to brainwash me by teaching how I should lick the feet of Gulen etc. They brainwashed many young students and their organizational structure was revealed many times but Erdogan didn't accept it just to keep the power.

&gt; So, we know Erdogan is a propagandist, a liar, corrupt and in bed with the mafia, why would you trust him on this, since he has a proven past of demonizing and creating ""terrorists"" out of his opponents, be they political or even simple university students.

I don't trust him. He is in alliance with other religious cults now which I believe should be purged. He will keep doing it but it doesn't change the fact that Gulenists were terrorists even before the coup or 2013.

2348,"&gt;Crimea used to be Russian but was given to Ukraine because of geography

Well, not quite. 

It was a ceremonial gift, not a real one. It was not approved by the Duma, but it became defacto apart of Ukraine. 

They ceremoniously gave it to Ukraine because it was the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1654 when the Cossack Rada apparently decided to unify with Muscovy. 

I suppose it makes more sense geographically than giving them Sakhalin, but they didn't do it for geographical purposes.

&gt;Even the law itself is double sided. On one side it upholds right of self determination, on the other guaranties the sovreignity of international borders as they are.

Yes to some extent. It should be no surprise that the west dominates the UN. They hire those with certain viewpoints and from there they play power politics. 

Self-determination is good when it benefits the U.S. and their allies. It's deemed ""illegal"" when it doesn't. 

See every example known to man.

&gt;Personally i am not interested in Crimea, i only do not agree with people comparing the two issues. The settings are different.

How are they different?

Both had their states dissolve their parliament and status. Had Russia not saved Crimea, how many would be dead right now? Look at Eastern Ukraine. Ukraine originally threatened Crimea with violence.

Vowel-heavy is a bit of an understatement lmao.

2405,"Russia has agreed to release $500m in credit to Belarus and look to increase the number of flights between the two countries as the Kremlin doubled down on its support for Alexander Lukashenko after his forced landing of a passenger flight that has sparked western condemnation.

Russian president Vladimir Putin hosted Lukashenko in Sochi on Saturday, treating his guest to a yacht trip on the Black Sea a day after the two men held talks for more than five hours.

The two-day summit has underscored Moscow’s position as the embattled autocrat’s closest and most reliable foreign ally, and took place as the US joined the EU in imposing sanctions against Minsk.

Russia’s support for Lukashenko was in stark contrast to US and EU condemnation and could complicate preparations for a summit between Putin and US president Joe Biden in Geneva next month, which has been billed as an effort to normalise relations between Moscow and the west.

Belarusian authorities used a bomb threat and a fighter jet to force a Ryanair flight travelling between Greece and Lithuania to divert to Minsk on May 23, where police then detained Roman Protasevich, a leading dissident journalist, who was on board.

That brazen move, described by Ryanair as “state-sponsored piracy”, provoked condemnation from western countries.

The EU has banned Belarus state airline Belavia from its airports and pledged to impose additional sanctions against the country, while Biden on Friday reimposed “full blocking sanctions” against nine Belarus state-owned companies.

The Kremlin has criticised the west’s response and, announced that a delayed $500m loan to Minsk would be released by the end of June.

The money represents the second tranche of a $1bn financial package Moscow agreed in December to bolster Lukashenko’s finances, which have been hit by the fallout from mass protests against his fraudulent election victory last year, and the impact of Covid-19.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the transport ministries of Russia and Belarus would work together to “organise air transportation” that would allow Belarusians to travel to Russia for summer vacations and to fly home from European countries via Russia, offsetting the impact of the EU’s flight ban.

“President Lukashenko informed [Putin] in detail about what happened to the Ryanair plane,” Peskov told reporters, adding that the talks were “very constructive, rich in content”.

The Kremlin has dismissed as “Russophobia” western claims that Moscow assisted Minsk in the operation to arrest Protasevich or was given advance warning.

The dissident founded a media channel that reported on and helped co-ordinate protests against Lukashenko.

Russia this week forced at least two European airlines to cancel flights to Moscow after it failed to approve new flight plans involving a detour around Belarus.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/no6je7/russia_releases_500m_loan_to_belarus_as_west/gzyfytf/,usmilitarythrowaway1,1622362469

2491,"The passage from his book *Travels through Sweden, Finland and Lapland to the North Cape in the years 1798 and 1799* is fairly amusing, although not that different from a modern travel book that tries to spice up the description of Finland:

&gt; Another particular that appeared very singular among the customs of the Fins, was their baths, and manner of bathing. Almost all the Finnish peasants have a small house built on purpose for a bath: it consists of only one small chamber,  in the innermost part of which are placed a number of stones,  which are heated by fire till they become red. On these stones, thus heated, water is thrown, until the company within be involved in a thick cloud of vapour. In this innermost part,  the chamber is formed in to two stories for the accommodation of a greater number of persons within that small compass; and it being the nature of heat and vapour to ascend,  the second story is, of course, the hottest. Men and women use the bath promiscuously, without any concealment of dress,  or being in the least influenced by any emotions of attachment. If, however, a stranger open the door, and come on the bathers by surprise, the women are not a little startled at his appearance; for, besides his person, he introduces along with him, by opening the door, a great quantity of light, which discovers at once to the view their situation, as  well as forms. Without such an accident they remain, if not in total darkness, yet in great obscurity, as there is no other window besides a small hole, nor any light but what enters infrom some chink in the roof of the house, or the crevices between the pieces of wood of which it  is constructed. I often amused myself with surprising the bathers in this manner, and I once or twice tried to go in and join the assembly;  but the heat was so excessive that I could not breathe, and in the space of a minute at most, I verily believe, must have been suffocated. I sometimes stepped in for a moment, just to leave my thermometer in some proper place, and immediately went out again, where I would remain for a quarter of an hour, or ten minutes,  and then enter again, and fetch the instrument to ascertain the degree of heat. My astonishment was so great that I could scarcely believe my senses, when I found that those people remain together, and amuse themselves for the space of half an hour, and sometimes a whole hour, in  the same chamber, heated to the 70th or  75th degree of Celsius. The thermometer,  in contact with those vapours, became sometimes so hot, that I could scarcely hold it in my hands.  

&gt; The Finlanders,  all the while they are in this hot bath, continue to rub themselves, and lash every part of their bodies with switches formed of twigs of the birch-tree. In ten minutes they become as red as raw flesh, and have altogether a very frightful appearance. In the winter season they frequently go out of the bath, naked as they are, to roll themselves in the snow, when the cold is at 20 and even 30 degrees below zero. They will sometimes come out, still naked, and converse together, or with any one near them, in the open air. It travellers happen to pass by while the peasants of any hamlet,or little village, are in the bath; and their assistance is needed, they will leave the bath, and assist in yoking or unyoking, and fetching provender for the horses, or in anything else, without any sort of covering whatever, while the passenger sits shivering with cold, though wrapped up in a good sound wolf's skin. There is nothing more wonderful than the extremities which man is capable of enduring through the power of habit. The Finnish peasants pass thus instantaneously from an atmosphere of 70 degrees of heat, to one of 30 degrees of cold, a transition of ahundred degrees, which is the same thing as going out of boiling into freezin gwater!And what is more astonishing, without the least inconvenience; while other people are very sensibly affected by a variation of but five degrees, and in danger of being afflicted with rheumatism by the most trifling wind that blows. Those peasants assure you, that with out the hot vapour baths they could not sustain as they do, during the whole day, their various labours. By the bath, they tell you, their strength is  recruited as much as by rest and sleep. The heat of the vapour mollifies to such a degree their skin, that the men easily shave themselves with wretched razors, and without soap. Had Shakspeare known of a people who could thus have pleasure in such quick transition from excessive heat to the severest cold, his knowledge might have been encreased, but his creative fancy could not have been affifted: - 

&gt; Oh!  who can hold a fire in his hand,

2493,"&gt;Western and Eastern europens don't mix well either.
&gt;
&gt;Oh but they do! When Western and Eastern Europeans have babies, those babies are beautiful, white and fully European looking. A half German, half Russian person can't be distinguished visually from full German or full Russians.
&gt;
The baby might have mix d ethnicity, but it will be fully white racially. It will have a lovely European nose, lips, facial bone structure, hair texture, eye shape, hair and eye colour, skin tone and body proportions.
&gt;
&gt;When a European has a mixed race child with a black or Asian... Oh boy. The child will look like the race of the non-European parent. Mixed race, half sub Saharan African people look especially bad by European beauty standards. They look completely foreign. They have the wide flat African noses, the huge protruding lips, the prognathous faces, the terrible pot scrubber coiled hair that is always black, black eyes, brown skin, small calf muscles, high posteriori. Sometimes the hair looks like telephone cords.
&gt;
&gt;Look at the mixed kids of Heidi Klum. They do not look European at all. They look Nigerian.
&gt;
&gt;So mixing out with other races is bad for Europe. It will eradicate our European beauty. It will eradicate our appearance. It will result in the ethnic cleansing if Europeans and our physical character, resulting in a future Europe where everyone looks black African.
&gt;
&gt;Both Europe and Africa will then be filled with Nigritic looking people and the original Europeans will be gone. It's ethnic cleansing
&gt;
&gt;Why do you support ethnic cleansing of Europeans from the continent where we evolved? Why do you want women with long blonde wavy hair, round blue eyes, small lips and long narrow noses to go extinct?
&gt;
&gt;Western and Eastern Europeans mixing will preserve the European people and our beauty.

2637,"&gt; Reality contradicts you. The EU is a common marketplace defined by free movement of goods, services, people, capital and enterprises. It can't be more unregulated than that. One common critique on the EU is that it neglects its social aspect. There are social rights but those are secondary, moreso soft law.

Now you are just confused. None of those rights guarantee anything with respect to specific regulations. Yes, there is freedom of movement of goods and services between EU nations. But they all have to adhere to the same BS EU standards on top of BS national standards.

&gt; Maybe it would be interesting for you to read about the Commissions' guidelines and the EU norms about preventing state subsidies. It is very hard now thanks to the EU that governments of member states subsidise certain companies on their ground so that they could have a better concurrential position. 

If you have so little clue about innovation, that you think you need government subsidies to innovate, I can't help you.

&gt; Companies have profited enormously of this common market. No customs within the EU, no tariffs, equal playing field and so on. The Brexit is a nightmare for most enterprises and companies. More costs, more paperwork, more hinderences transporting and so on: a logistical and costly disaster.

Still, no innovation.

&gt; Socialist populist distopia? I don't think you know what it means or that you are well informed. The majority of the European parliament is center to right leaning ideology.

2672,"&gt;Now you are just confused. None of those rights guarantee anything with respect to specific regulations. Yes, there is freedom of movement of goods and services between EU nations. But they all have to adhere to the same BS EU standards on top of BS national standards.

That is not how EU-law works. There are differences between Regulations, Directives, the Treaties and Decisions. Combine this with fundamental principles of EU-law such as direct effect (horizontal/vertical). This ensures that you can't just put EU-law on top of your nation state law. Depending the formal type of law, EU-law goes above national law, except if national law is in a better position to regulate it, then there is the principle of subsidiarity that plays. Pay attention to nuances.

&gt;If you have so little clue about innovation, that you think you need government subsidies to innovate, I can't help you.

Reading comprehension is key. I didn't say that governmental subsidies are vital to innovation. What I did try to educate you on is that the EU and it's bundle of norms and regulations made it possible to create a level playing field for companies and enterprises. By having good barriers to prevent state subsidies the EU tries to minimalise the nefast effect governmental subsidies have on the level of competition. The EU wants to promote competition. And it does that very well. Competition breeds, or at least contributes to innovation. It's basic understanding. It is also common knowledge that governmental subsidies which puts certain companies in a very advantageous position does stagnate innovation in a significant way: the company is mostly content with keeping it's dominant position and does the minimal instead of innovating to get ahead of the game. There is a reason tons of books, guidelines and legislative work goes into this.

&gt;Still, no innovation.

It is also widely know so far that Brexit, and the increase of barriers to trade does stagnate innovation. There is less incentive because of it and it becomes more difficult. Tapping in other markets is key to innovate, and Brexit made that harder. Also, basic stuff.

&gt;The EU parliament is absolutely useless for the most part. Most decisions are taken outside. By the year, the EU is becoming more and more centrally planned, with little parliamentary control.

Saying that the EU parliament is useles just proves that you have no understanding about how EU-institutions and the leglislative process works. Just to give you an example: the Parliament is a co-legislator, it has the power to adopt and amend legislation and decides on the annual EU budget on an equal footing with the Council. It supervises the work of the Commission and other EU bodies and cooperates with national parliaments of EU countries to receive their input. And of course, the parliament has many more roles that it plays. On top of that we in Europe have elections for it.

&gt;The reality is that little has happened with respect to innovation in the EU in the last decades. I don't care how you try to ""explain away"" this fact.

I advise you to read this if you are able to: [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/67/innovation-policy](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/67/innovation-policy)

On the other hand, the largest single ethnic group in the U.S, German-Americans only accounts for 14% of the population, and most americans have mixed ancestry.

Whether someone is male or female is very important for me, e.g when it comes to picking a (potential) partner.

Objectively speaking, if we simply define the terms ""woman"" and ""man"" based on biological sex, why would you mind being called a ""man"", if that's the accurate description based on the definition? Where would the problem be? Why would it hurt you?

The answer is because you want to be a biological female, but since you can never achieve this, you want to settle for the second best option: living in a fantasy world that considers you to be and treats you like a biological female. 

As I have said I appreciate that you were civil in this discussion. I don't want you to suffer, I don't want to hurt you, but I'm simply not convinced.

2776,"Lol no it's not,the year before the British,launched an airstrike from a British  aircraft carrier  that knocked out 3 Italian battleships. In early  41, 11 months before the fall of Singapore,  the Germans had created an entire  elite squadron called fliegerkorps 10 to cripple to two British aircraft carriers in less then 6 months of each other.

The British routinely sent the battle ships out with aircraft carriers to protect them with air cover. Look at both force H and the Mediterranean fleets.

Again the British had crippled the bismark on its first voyage with aircraft. 

It was well believed at  that sending both prince of Wales and repulse to the far east was a mistake,but churchill wanted them there.

Force z had asked for aircover from Singapore and by the time  they had arrived  it was to late,the planes arrived 7 mins after both had sunk.

The admiral at the head of force z thought he could use his ships like bismark and he did and achieved fuck all,sorry minus destroying on out of date battle cruiser.

So to say that they didn't know the power of aircraft is crap  the British had used airpower to crippling effect in the Mediterranean two years before and had been on the end of it as well.

The fate of force Z was down to poor planning, poor communications and stupidity, the same can be said of the fall of Singapore.",,/r/europe/comments/nnrey5/italian_projapanese_poster_celebrating_the/gzxvqrl/,andyoudaballnight,1622345901

There’s a huge age difference between me and my siblings (my sister is 13 years younger, mom had her at 38) because my parents wanted for us to have a better childhood than they had. My grandparents had multiple children and both my mom and dad grew up really poor. So when they became parents they decided to wait so we could have our own rooms, enough money to cover our needs and they had enough time they could spend with us.

I would never have a child if I lived in a one room apartment or at my parents/in-laws and had only a part time poorly paid job. And that’s the reality for many young Polish people now.

There was virtually no response from the west. In my opinion, Russia is perceived more as an annoyance than an actual threat.

Climate change will exacerbate (and already is) tensions and conflicts in the Sahel; there may well be multiple state failure, the rise of Islamic extremism and herder-pastoral tribal conflict across the Sahel, driving enormous migration waves to the N African coast and Europe. And ofc there’s the danger of destabilisation in the Indian subcontinent with Bangladesh flooding with sea level rise and erratic weather patterns eroding farmland, as well as the Himalayan glaciers melting and causing potential serious conflict. Refugees may well pour westwards or to Europe.

Hell even subsidize housing aimed at young families.

2972,"&gt;Would you stop with your bullshit please.  You know exactly what I mean by racially and ethnically European. 

I genuinely don't. 

1. Because race is a pseudoscientific concept, there is no European race, any less than there is an Asian race or an American race.
2. Because European isn't an ethnicity, it's a geographic denomination. You will be surprised to learn that Poles and Germans, although sharing a similar frontier, are too vastly different groups. Same goes with French and Italians, Greeks and Serbs etc...

So again, what do you mean by Europeans? Because I can take your idiotic argument to its logical conclusion. Considering that the only populations of Europe which are descended from  the pre-indoeuropean nomads of the Yamna culture survive in Sardinia and the south of Corsica, I say that we relocate all Europeans to the Caucasus and give Europe to its rightful owners: Sards and Corsicans.

&gt;Humans moved into Europe and then evolved and mutated to become a distinct racial group, visually distinct from the racial groups in other areas.

You are talking about European peoples as if they are some kind of new Chihuahua breed. You realise that all humans belong to one species? That they all can reproduce together and have offspring right? And that while some traits are exhibited by Europeans in particular, you can find them in other human groups right? Right?! 

&gt;This is something even a child understands?  Why are you trying to obfuscate what European means?

Because it is an obtuse term. Like it or not, Europe is an abstract construction. There isn't a single possible ground by which you can say that ""This is Europe, and this is not Europe"". Even geographically, Europe belongs to the ""Eurasian plate"", not the European plate. Moreover, the ancestors of modern Europeans, those nomads of the Yamna Culture, they are also the ancestors of Iranians and Indians *(at least linguistically)* and they spread as far as the borders of China.

&gt;Even better question, why are you allying yourself with non-Europeans/non-whites?  

I am allying myself with no one. The Anatolians, modern Turkic peoples, are closer to British than Tajiks, Europe

&gt;What are they paying you to support mass immigration and diversification despite the terrible harm it will do to future generations of native, original Europeans?  

I don't care about how mass immigration and diversification will do to Europe, I'm not European, but I care about dumb fucks like you spreading myths to scare people. Immigration and diversification in Europe is far from the boogeyman the Far Right want you to believe. European countries will do just fine. 

&gt;Don't tell me you are doing this purely for Reddit karma?

With older woman I was also more talking about \~45. For the age of 40 the risk of getting a baby with down syndrome is 1:84. At 45 it is 1:32.

So the chances of getting a miscarriage or a baby that has down syndrome (not including other stuff) at the age of 40 are about 34% at 45+ it is about 55%. So yea ... far from my exaggerated claim but imo a risk that should be considered (not saying that older woman should not get children but just saying that sooner would be better (and not only due to medical reasons ... being in your early 20s and see your parents turn 60 very soon is imo not really fun either))",,/r/europe/comments/nnjzzw/avarage_age_of_women_to_give_birth_of_the_first/gzwmga1/,jerry_miller8337,1622319746

&gt;Military build up in China and the South China sea will be the next flashpoint. It's far enough away not to be our fight. We have been involved in nearly every fight for centuries, time to sit a few out. Rebuild our society rather than war machines.

So you’ve gone from state vs state warfare being extinct, to now saying the south China sea will be the next flashpoint? Well which is it?

I’ll leave you with this quote, from a man who held the same beliefs as you:

*”How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing. It seems still more impossible that a quarrel which has already been settled in principle should be the subject of war.*

*I can well understand the reasons why the Czech Government have felt unable to accept the terms which have been put before them in the German memorandum. Yet I believe after my talks with Herr Hitler that, if only time were allowed, it ought to be possible for the arrangements for transferring the territory that the Czech Government has agreed to give to Germany to be settled by agreement under conditions which would assure fair treatment to the population concerned.*

*You know already that I have done all that one man can do to compose this quarrel. After my visits to Germany I have realised vividly how Herr Hitler feels that he must champion other Germans, and his indignation that grievances have not been met before this. He told me privately, and last night he repeated publicly, that after this Sudeten German question is settled, that is the end of Germany’s territorial claims in Europe.”*

He is an open atheist, a hypocrite known for visiting temples for pictures while torturing, exiling or killing Christians, openly flaunting his already frivolous laws.

3362,"After last week’s post about the [Dragon of Wawel Hill](https://brendan-noble.com/wawel-dragon-smok-wawelski-polish-legendary-dragon-slavic-mythology-saturday/), we’re continuing our series of dragons this [Slavic Saturday](https://brendan-noble.com/slavic-saturday/) with the [Żmij](https://brendan-noble.com/zmij-zmey-dragons-of-slavic-mythology-slavic-saturday/) (also known as Zmey/Змей, Zmei, Zmaj/Змај, Zmiy Змій), a popular form of the beasts from Slavic folktales and mythology. In other posts we’ll go into more details about named Żmije from across folktales, but for now, we’ll focus on Żmije in general.

Note: As we near June’s release of [A Dagger in the Winds](https://brendan-noble.com/books/a-dagger-in-the-winds/), the first book in my Slavic fantasy series called [The Frostmarked Chronicles](https://brendan-noble.com/books/the-frostmarked-chronicles-slavic-fantasy/), you can pre-order the book as well as join my monthly [newsletter](https://brendan-noble.com/newsletter/) for updates and free novellas (such as the recently released prequel, [The Rider in the Night](https://brendan-noble.com/newsletter/)) set in the world of the series.

Our dragons are different?

Whenever the topic of Slavic dragons is raised, people often ask how they are any different than the dragons found throughout most European myths. It’s a good question, as at first, it appears that the Żmije are just the massive, winged, fire-breathing serpents that have been made popular in folklore and fantasy. And it’s not wrong to claim they’re those beasts, but Żmije are in fact different.

It’s important to understand the etymology of the term Żmij or Zmey when looking at these dragons. Quite literally translating to “viper,” the Żmij represents perhaps peak of the serpent in Slavic myth. Serpents are incredibly important due to their connection to the god of the lowlands, magic, and the underworld: [Weles/Veles](https://brendan-noble.com/veles-weles-slavic-god-of-the-underworld-lowlands-and-cattle/). Weles is often represented as a serpent or dragon in his battle against the god of thunder, [Perun](https://brendan-noble.com/perun-god-of-thunder/). Though Weles is often considered a trickster and deceiver, he is not considered evil, and this is important to remember when discussing the dragons and serpents connected to him. “Evil” was rarely considered to be as black and white in Slavic myths as it is in modern-day and many western European folktales. So, knowing this connection to Weles and serpents, the differences between Żmije and the traditional dragons make sense. Not only are Żmije multi-headed dragons capable of breathing fire, they’re also incredibly smart tricksters capable of using cunning more than brute force to kidnap maidens and mess with a story’s hero. Like Slavic gods and many demons, they can even shape-shift. Usually, this means shape-shifting into humans for often sexual purposes. Offspring of dragons and humans were thought to become brave warriors and heroes.

Despite the destruction they could cause, the perceived war against the highest god of Perun, and Żmije shape-shifting and seducing women, these creatures were not considered evil – typically. Slavic pagans worshiped the gods but typically believed the gods’ wars were not to be interfered with. Dragons, like gods, were sometimes thought to have power over a specific element or area (making fire-breathing could just one possible weapon they wielded), so choosing a side in the wars among them and the gods was thought to be a poor decision. A satisfied dragon could provide help or a positive form of their element to a village, just like keeping Weles happy would protect farms and nature’s lowland forests. 

Regional Variations

Particularly among south Slavs, Żmije were protectors. Brutal storms could hit the Balkans, ravaging farms and villages. It was believed that these storms were brought by an Ala/Chała, a demon sometimes pictured as a dragon (or similar to one). Żmije defended villages from these demons, defeating them and earning a positive reputation in south Slavic myths. In Bulgarian folklore as well, a “Smok” (a snake) will turn into a Żmij after forty years.

Żmije are most typically associated with east Slavic tales, particularly from Russian fairy tales (called skazki). In these tales, dragons are typically enemies to be slayed by a bogatyr – the hero of the particular tale. Many of these stories originated after the arrival of Christianity, so it is likely this made Żmije take on the negative traits of serpents in Christian thought (associated with the Devil). The most famous of these dragons are Zmey Gorynych and Chudo-Yudo, who we will talk more about in future weeks. Interestingly, it is also said that a Żmij guards the path of souls into the underworld of [Nawia/Nav](https://brendan-noble.com/prawia-prav-jawia-yav-and-nawia-nav-the-three-realms-of-slavic-mythology/), and, like in Bulgarian folklore, both the Ukrainians and Belorussians have tales of serpents turning into Żmije after a certain number of years (seven and a hundred respectively).

Western Slavic dragons often combine elements of the Żmij and Germanic dragons. So, while the Żmij exists in western Slavic mythos, there are other dragons such as the Czech and Slovak “Drak” and the Polish “Smok.” We talked about [Smok Wawelski](https://brendan-noble.com/wawel-dragon-smok-wawelski-polish-legendary-dragon-slavic-mythology-saturday/), the Dragon of Wawel Hill, last week, who combined the Żmij’s love for kidnapping women with the western style of a dragon as well.

3363,"The fact that modern turkish relatively is more similar to old turkish doesn't mean that converting to Islam didn't harm our identity. It took years after formation of modern Turkey for turkish to became what it is today. Just a century before today we were speaking a hybrid language of persian, arabic and turkish. Heck speaking turkish was considered for peasents meanwhile governors would speak persian. Islam is not the thing that saved us from assimilation it was the exact thing that fastened it. Today's Turkish was formed after years of research to find what is ""turkish"" (researches that was lead by Atatürk to find roots of language but I wouldn't recommend to read them because some of them are really stupid such as Sun Language Theory) dedicating the rules and using those rules to make new words for those words that doesn't have turkish translation (The new language laws) then even forming a whole formation to save language from future assimilation (Türk Dil Kurumu). So no Islam didn't save us, we saved ourselves. And also the reason that those examples assimilated is because they were minorities if you are a minority you are most likely to get assimilated by some kind of imperialism.

3471,"I read about it, I honestly had not heard of that battle before. But it does not read as a decisive victory to me, rather a strategic one. Napoleon seems to have been able to use his genius to turn the tide of the battle to avoid the destruction of his army, but the campaign was already lost at that point anyway.

And from what I have heard before Napoleon retreated from Moscow due to a lack of food, combined with no peace being in sight. 

&gt;THERE WAS A COUP HAPPENING IN FRANCE

If it is the Malet coup, it started the [23rd of october](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malet_coup_of_1812). Napoleon strted the retreat from [moscow on the 19th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia). So the retreat from moscow was not due to the coup.

However, I am a bit confused. What I meant with him wanting a decisive battle was a battle that would end the war. And he did not get one, to his disappointment.

That an illegitimate claimant officially recognized an other illegitimate claimant also means absolutely nothing. Were they part of the Roman State? Were they Roman Citizens? Were they protectors of the Roman Republic? Were they elected as Roman Emperors by the Roman People, Roman Senate and Roman Army? 

The Roman Emperor was an office, not a regal title that could be sold or given away. If one did not fullful the above criteria, then his claims are simply illegitimate. The case is that when in 1453 AD the Roman Emperor fell, and the remaining free Romans did not appoint a new one in his stead, there was no other Roman Emperor. As for the Roman Emperor of Pontus, meaning David Megalos Komnenos who ruled from Trebizond, he is not exactly a 'proper' Roman Emperor, given that the Trapezountines had given up any imperial claim in the Treaty of 1282 AD.

But we don't even need to discuss theory here.

We do know what liberalization in the agricultural sector does.

It means that agri-giants buy everything and then decide to produce what is expected to be the most profitable on the international market. Farmers can keep working in their farms if they accept to do whatever the big boss want them to do. In many cases they don't accept such a situation. I'm sure that even with your minimal understanding of how an economy works, you can draw the logical conclusions from that.

3750,"Armed with a device designed for throwing tennis balls for dogs, it is possible to launch an egg a very satisfying 60 metres. Head to the Quartier Leopold in Brussels on the right day and you can see farmers from across Europe firing a wide range of produce an impressive distance at Belgian riot police. It is during these regular protests at the European Union’s headquarters that the ingenuity, bravery and diligence of the European farmer truly shows itself. In one episode a pair of tractors slowly drove through a barbed-wire barricade, as cops scattered. When an armoured police van turned up, the farmers drove into that too. It took two water cannons at full blast to make the tractors retreat. 

Over the years, grumpy farmers have covered stoic Belgian riot police in hay, eggs, and milk direct from the udder.A riot can be the voice of the unheard. It can also be a tantrum of the ludicrously privileged. European farmers are politically powerful in the same way that the sky is blue: it is a fact so universally acknowledged that it is usually not worth mentioning. This power was apparent this week in the final negotiations between diplomats, members of the European Parliament and officials over the terms under which farmers will receive €270bn ($330bn) in 2023-27. That the farmers will get the cash is a given. The debate is about how many conditions will be attached, with the options ranging from not a lot to very few indeed.

The Common Agricultural Policy (cap) is a tumour in the eu’s body politic. Sucking up a third of the group’s budget, it is a neat illustration of its struggle to change itself for the better. What began six decades ago as a quid pro quo between France and Germany (farming bungs in exchange for market access) is still in place. It is an odd form of redistribution. About 20% of farms get 80% of the money. Aristocrats, agri-giants and the Catholic church all take a juicy cut. Companies linked to Andrej Babis, the billionaire Czech prime minister, got €34m ($42m) one year. Money is shifted from European taxpayers to landowners, in a frankly feudal farce. 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, there is a pretence that things will improve. This time, the European Commission has given up. “We have to acknowledge that there will be no revolution in the cap,” said Frans Timmermans, the commissioner tasked with making Europe greener.History is littered with once-mighty interest groups that have withered. Coalminers in Germany and Poland will have cash thrown at them as their industries are phased out as part of the plan for a “just transition” to a green economy. But this amounts to a free bar at a wake. By contrast, farmers remain as powerful as ever. Partly this is down to the nature of food. People care more about what they put in their mouths than how they heat their homes or the bodywork of their Audis. Unlike coal or steel, food is not truly fungible. An Italian may spurn a tomato from Spain, never mind one flown in from Morocco, or a genetically modified American one. For a continent without a common tongue, snobbery about domestic produce provides a universal language.

&amp;#x200B;

The way the EU cooks up agricultural policy helps farmers keep their outsized power. Normally, policymaking in Brussels is a bazaar, with everything for sale at the right price. Officials from countries haggle with each other, surrendering on one topic to get what they want on another file. As a system it is opaque, but it works. By contrast, farming is insulated from the other subjects of haggling, sealed off in its own special committee. The result is that governments try to grab as much cash as they can, rather than question whether it should be there in the first place.

For all the talk of the eu’s democratic deficit, agriculture is an area where the eu suffers from a surplus of democracy. Dead-eyed technocrats would happily chop farming subsidies. European politicians will not let them. In France any self-respecting presidential candidate must spend time sniffing cheese at agricultural fairs. Farming generates barely 1% of European GDP. But its fate has outsized importance. Rather than left or right, the political battleground across much of Europe is a fight between urban centres and the rural periphery. 

Britain’s exit removed one of the few big governments that was less neuralgic about the future of farming (as its current enthusiasm for free-trade deals with agricultural powerhouses like Australia attests). For most of the EU, slashing subsidies would be an assault on a politically potent rural hinterland. It is a fight few want to have.

Luckily, some do. Greta Thunberg, a young Swedish climate activist, has joined a cabal of NGOs hammering the eu for not doing enough to curb agriculture’s environmental effects. At the moment, whatever ambition the eu has for climate policy melts away when it comes to farming, even though its emissions rival much heavier industries. Farmers can no longer brush off the concern. Environmental policy has gone from the hobby-horse of sandal-wearers to an existential policy debate. From now on, the farmers will have a fight on their hands. Things can get better. After all, the cap used to be even worse. 

The days when European taxpayers paid to overproduce products that were then dumped on poor countries are over. But it took years of concerted campaigning to shift the butter mountains and the wine lakes.It is too late to make a difference this time, as talks over the €270bn come to a close. A slow grinding fight led by the likes of Ms Thunberg is necessary if the cap is to be overhauled. Ensuring that farmers do their bit for the climate, and stopping the transfer of cash to those who do not need it would be a start. 

The story of European policymaking is one of path dependency in which errors take years (and usually a big crisis) to unpick. Until then, the cap will remain a scar on the eu, a visible reminder of how hard it is to undo past mistakes. Should it ever look like being fixed, though, it will be wise to avoid the eu quarter in Brussels.

Nobody got shot or anything. We were part of the USSR proper, so we didn't have a local dictator like Ceaucescu. Instead, we had a Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic which was the regional government in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, so on a tight leash from Moscow.

Right in the period after the we regained independence, some of the more ""enterprising"" party members used their power to grab lots of real estate and formerly-state-owned companies.

Not at all.

These exercises have constraints imposed on them, such as the use of active sonar, geographic restrictions etc.

This is to provide some training benefit where to play the exercise as in war time would provide none.

To give you an example, a Type 45 Destroyer operating off the South West coast of the UK detects the Hawks used to 'attack' them when they take off from the airfield. However they're allowed to get in close to test the close range defences. Whereas in war time, they'd have been shot down long ago.

It has 4 semi-cylindrical corner towers fitted with battlements and arrow slits. The gem of the castle is its unique keep which dates back to the 12th century. It is located to one side, it's 17 m high and it has 3 floors. The first floor has a traditional Almohad ribbed vault which is the only example of its kind in Spanish military architecture.

3888,"&gt;It’s as simple as research done that confirmed both a difference between trans and cis people

... AND THIS EXACTLY is my argument! There is a difference between trans and cis people. There is a difference between what you refer to as ""cis woman"" and what you refer to as ""trans woman"".

Nobody can deny this difference, yet by trying to change what the words ""man"" and ""woman"" or ""he"" and ""she"" refer to, they want to make this difference invisible.

The ones you refer to as ""trans women"" want to be called ""woman"" because they hate this difference and they want to eradicate this difference.

That's why they do the surgery, but that's not enough. And because that's not enough they want to go one step further and eradicate the difference from language as well. 

The ideology is that there is no difference. But as you have said yourself: There is. There simply is. And that's why I won't use the same term to describe them and real women.

The question we have to ask ourselves is: What defines a woman? What defines a man? If it's not how they dress, speak and act, what else is it? Just how you identify as? Then there would be no need for a binary system or any distinguishing at all. If it's based purely on identification and that identification is based on nothing, then both terms are meaningless and useless.

There is a massive biological difference that exists in almost every species and that has massive consequences. That's why we originally started to differenciate between the two. And this is why there needs to be a distinction. 

But if we use the old system to make a useless and meaningless distingtion, what system do we use to make the important one? The answer is none, because that's what they want. They want to eradicate the important distinction from language in order to appease their emotions, their ideology: the belief that there is no difference. But there is and that's why I refuse to participate in the attempted change of language. 

I appreciate the civil discussion but it appears as we will have to agree to disagree.",,/r/europe/comments/n2egrh/poland_rejects_inclusion_of_third_gender_in_new/gztw3zz/,Diqmorphin,1622254588

Belarus no longer has access to those sorts of feeds. It’ll very slowly damage the country’s understanding of the outside world, insulate their culture, and set them back technologically. This is the sort of decision where those it impacts don’t understand the impact until well after it’s too late to fix. I feel for those living in Belarus. Best of luck as you head into the dark.

It explicitly comes to the conclusion that national governments do not have the power to interfere in the ECBs decisionmaking (at least on their own), neither the Commission and the Parliament even receive a mention, and rightfully so. Out of all EU institutions, the parliament is probably the one with the least influence on the ECB. Any EU institution has less power over the ECB than the group of national states - through their appointments of ECB council members and the directors. Even though the appointment of the president itself is done by the commission president, the decision is made by the member states. So far, no country (or group of countries) was able to install a puppet in that position however.

For sure not. But I know someone at a hospital and they've done dozens more of ""CTs"" (CATs?) than normally because of headaches (plotttwist: Noone had it). Still, very bad to do that unnecessarily.

More important, though: How high is your risk in your daily life? And if you can do homeoffice and don't have kids, it's often lower (at the currently low infection rates) than the risk of suffering from a ""Sinusvenenthrombose"" (which is what the STIKO bases their descision on).

Oh and 6 weeks is the offical approval. So that should be fine enough. If you can, I'd postpone it by another 1 or 2 weeks for some extra protection but probably it's better in your age anyways than in the average studies.

4387,"The United States is growing at such a blistering pace the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates. In Britain, retail sales grew by nine per cent this month, the fastest pace on record, as the economy opened up again. Around the world, economies are starting to bounce back strongly from the Covid-19 crisis. Except for one: France. We learned today that the country is now officially in a double-dip recession. The explanation? That is easy. It made a complete hash of its vaccination programme.

In the first-quarter of this year, revised figures showed that France’s output shrank by 0.1 per cent. That followed a 1.5 per cent contraction in the final quarter of 2020, making two consecutive quarters of falling output, the standard definition of a recession. That was driven by an 8.3 per cent fall in household spending – hardly surprising since nothing was open. 

'The main message from today’s data still is that 2021 GDP forecasts likely will have to be revised down, and that the slowdown at the start of Q2 was fiercer than initially anticipated,' argued Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note.

It is not hard to work out what has gone wrong. France relied on the EU to source vaccines for the country, but that was painfully slow. The shots were not approved quickly enough, and not enough had been bought. Even worse, the government sowed doubts in an already sceptical population by constantly changing its mind about the safety of the AstraZeneca jab. 

Of course, in fairness, France has largely fixed the vaccination issue, and is now getting jabs into people’s arms at the same rate as the UK or Germany. But it lost a crucial three months along the way. On top of that, Britain’s departure from the EU hasn’t helped. There has been a significant drop in cross-Channel trade, and while that has hit the UK, it has, of course, hit France as well. The cost of that in lost output is now becoming painfully apparent.

In fact, a double dip recession, especially one that is largely self-inflicted, is the last thing president Macron needs right now. There are two big problems. 

First, France can’t really afford it. No one has been paying too much attention to debt levels over the last year, mainly because every government has been borrowing money on an unprecedented scale, but on some measures France has overtaken Italy as the third largest debtor in the world (measured by the total amount owed). More than half of that 2.67 trillion euros (£2.3 trillion) of debt, or 115 per cent of GDP, is owed internationally, unlike Italian debt. For now, the European Central Bank is willing to buy all that with freshly printed money. And yet, at some point, higher and higher debt levels for a smaller and smaller economy are going to be a problem. It is just a question of when. 

Next, Macron already faces a tricky presidential election in April next year, only ten months away. The polls show him beating his likely run-off challenger Marine Le Pen. But not by a huge margin. There will be a few percentage points in it. A recession is hardly going to help a politician whose main claim to office is technocratic brilliance. He could really use some growth right now – but it does not look as if that is going to happen.",,/r/europe/comments/nn16m3/france_is_paying_a_heavy_price_for_macrons/gzruesj/,casualphilosopher1,1622218097

4401,"This is Brexit all over again. The Swiss government pulled the plug on its seven-year negotiation of the EU-Swiss institutional framework agreement on Wednesday. Its failure was driven by familiar issues: freedom of movement and dynamic alignment. Just one year ago, the EU's Brexit negotiators still insisted on dynamic alignment — the idea that Britain would have to follow new EU rules even after it left the bloc. It was only the credible threat of the Johnson administration walking out of negotiations that ended this anti-democratic monstrosity. Every country, the EU included, has the right to restrict market access. But nobody has the right to impose their own legislation dynamically on third countries. This cannot be excused by the idea that, as the larger body in almost any negotiation, the EU has economic might on its side.

Freedom of movement clearly played a role as it did during Brexit. It is intricately interwoven with full membership of the single market and of the EU itself. It is only when member states have full voting rights in the European institutions that such a transfer of power is democratically legitimate. Germany's constitutional court would rule any such agreement null and void if dynamic alignment was imposed on the country. And yet, as the largest member of the EU, it is happy to impose laws on other countries that it would find unconstitutional.

The EU would do well to reflect on its own mistakes during the Brexit years: playing with the opposition against the government in extending deadlines; interfering in the domestic debate by unofficially backing a second referendum; and by insisting on dynamic alignment during trade talks. The EU’s conduct during this period hardened pro-Brexit views in the UK and generated unassailable majorities for the pro-Brexit Tory party.

Switzerland and the UK are among the richest countries in the world. Both are very old democracies. What inspired the Brits to leave is exactly the same EU approach that has now stopped the Swiss from half-joining. In both cases, the debate was accompanied by Project Fear threats about inevitable economic decline. The pro-EU argument was utilitarian. It didn’t work politically because utility is not distributed evenly across the voting population. In other words, there is one class that enjoyed the benefits of EU membership while another saw little to no benefit at all. And to the surprise of economists, not all voters are as utilitarian in the way economic models demand them to be. Switzerland and the UK have also, historically, been relatively successful in shifting national business models. They will now need to do this again.

The agreement would have secured Swiss access to the single market, opening the door to new agreements in energy and healthcare. Switzerland has already signed more than 120 bilateral agreements with the EU that have enabled barrier-free access to the rest of the union. But it rejected a proposal to join the European economic area in 1992, and its bilateral agreements are problematic because they have had to be renegotiated every time EU law changes. With so many agreements, the process often stalls — if it happens at all — and the EU has insisted since 2008 that Switzerland must sign the framework agreement before concluding any new bilateral deals.

But what were the substantial differences that led to the deal's collapse? It came down to three contentious points that have not been resolved since 2018 when the agreement was first drafted: wage protection, state aid rules, and the access of EU citizens to Swiss social security benefits.

There was domestic resistance from both the right and the left. The conservative Swiss People’s party rejects European integration and celebrated the decision as a victory for Swiss sovereignty. On the issue of wage protection, the pro-European Social Democratic party was under pressure from unions to oppose the agreement. But Swiss social security benefits were the most contentious issue, with Ignazio Cassis, the Swiss foreign minister, arguing that concessions would have amounted to a fundamental shift for the country’s migration policy. Switzerland wanted to retain the right to choose who settles in its borders and what support the government is expected to give them.

It is too soon to tell whether abandoning the framework agreement will be an economic disaster for Switzerland. Its decision not to join the EEA in 1992 was not a disaster. But if the EU sticks to its word and does not renegotiate the bilateral deals, regulatory divergence is all but inevitable.

This will become a major problem as existing deals come to an end. Just this week, a deal on medical device standards expired, meaning Swiss medical exporters lost access to the single market. Within two years, agreements on mechanical, electrical, and metal industries will also expire, putting 300,000 jobs and 55 per cent of goods exports on the chopping block. Capital markets, the power grid, and Switzerland’s participation in the EU science research programme are also at risk. The EU should reflect deeply about Brexit and the Swiss 'nein' — and avoid assuming this is a right-wing conspiracy. In the UK we heard the expression of bad people lying to stupid people. If that is what you want to believe, go ahead. But it won’t solve your problem.

Instead of this insistence of rigid and ratcheting alignment, the EU should offer an outer layer of membership — an associate membership — that includes the customs union but not the single market. That way it respects the democratic rights of all countries, in and out, and presents them with a choice of benefits and obligations. It’s the half-in status — the one that the UK rejected — which causes all the problems.",,/r/europe/comments/nn17ct/the_eu_has_learnt_nothing_from_brexit/gzrujzi/,casualphilosopher1,1622218158

That not only devalues the caregiver's qualification, but also invokes stereotypes and prejudice, somewhere along the following lines: To a polish woman, being offered the chance to work in Germany is so great she will gladly accept the shitty job of live-in caregiver despite the long hours, the hard and sometimes yucky work, and the bad pay, because it is obviously so much better than any job she could possibly get back in Poland, and therefore Grandma and especially Grandma's family, who pay for her, are entitled to treat her like shit.",,/r/europe/comments/nmxyat/german_ad_grandmas_new_polish_woman/gzremwp/,hjholtz,1622211244

4541,"&gt;How much was it and was she personally responsible of using that money?

How much was what? Well she is PM, of course she has responsibility of somethings at least. Knowing whether or not you paid for your own breakfast would be one of those.  

&gt;Yes, other PMs have used it and the decision to use it did not come from her.

Some used it some didn't. 


&gt;There was existing compensation, her office used it. That has not been the problem, the only problem is that it is unclear if it is tax free or not.

According to the article I linked that isn't true. I'll quote below.

&gt;&gt;In fact, the Prime Minister's Office used Articles 6 and 7 of the Act on Ministers' Salaries and Allowances to try to justify the legality of paid breakfasts.

&gt;&gt;However, the aforementioned articles do not not refer to any kind of food provisions. They just state that ""The prime minister is provided with housing in a state-owned building and the State is responsible for the costs incurred due to its maintenance, heating, lighting and furnishings, plus the necessary staff"" and that "" Based on a decision by the Prime Minister's Office, a minister is reimbursed for reasonable extra costs associated with ministerial responsibilities.""


&gt;This is only a problem for right wingers. Everyone else sees it as what it is: bureaucracy.

I doubt that is true. You seem to be playing party politics with. If not every PM did it, then clearly it's a reflection of her morals.

4657,"&gt; Finally, one needs to keep in mind that a pipeline creates a bilateral dependence: Russia depends on the EU remaining a reliable customer. The bilateral economic link is much more important for Russia since earnings from gas exports make up a significant portion of Russia’s overall export earnings (and the revenues of the Russian government) – but are only a tiny fraction of the European economy.

&gt; Furthermore, Europe already has an alternative source of supply in the form of free capacity for LNG imports. This means that Russia depends much more on the EU as a customer than the other way round. To achieve its own ‘gas market independence’ from Europe, Russia would need to construct a costly capacity to export LNG from facilities closer to fields near the Arctic Circle. With Nord Stream 2 it has less of an incentive to do so.

[Nord Stream 2 – a red herring at the bottom of the sea
](https://www.ceps.eu/nord-stream-2-a-red-herring-at-the-bottom-of-the-sea/)

It's all a geopolitical ""problem"" and the Americans and some countries in Europe just don't want to lose any influence or money. One can understand, but in Germany one should clearly say fuck off. I'm not a fan that the Greens cling to the Americans so much and want to withdraw the political will from everything.

It goes even further. At the same time, Russia is increasingly becoming dependent with China - also largely through gas sales. If the US actually feels threatened mainly by China, then it is in its own best interest to bind the EU and Russia closer together in order to keep Russia out of China's power bloc.



Pretty sure NS2 is a good thing

You always here arguments about Germany being dependent on Russia.

Germany being dependent on Russian gas is not a valid argument against Nord Stream 2. 

1 Germany amd Russia will create a codependency, because Russia needs the money of European countries buying their gas. Russia has been pretty reliable when it came to trade with Germany.
Germany needs the gas for some years now, because we want to change our energy sources, here it depends who will make which decisions in Germany on focusing renewable resources.


2. This whole thing of the US being against the pipeline is about them wanting to sell us their dirty gas.
Which may be good for the US, but bad for the enviornment and possibly more expensive for us.

A valid argument would be, that some eastern European countries would be affected in a negative way like Ukraine.

Just because there is a pipeline doesn't mean that it will be used.

But I don't think Germany will be using gas for many decades to come.



The Ukraine point is a problem. But since when has 'depriving another nation of income' ever been a reason not to do something that was in the national interest? Embargos, for example, are harming third party nation's income as well. Tax heavens are responsible for billions in lost tax income. Poland, for example, jumped at the opportunity of stationing thousands of US troops from Germany as well. Did they care about the economic impact on Germany?

Germany was dependent on Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Poland.
All four are not nice nations, Poland is the friendliest and that says something.
So why should Germany be dependent on four and not just one especially regarding that Ukraine for example caused problems for us in the past.

Increasing European energy dependency on Russia, is up to every single nation. Germany wants to become climate-neutral by 2050. Many other nations have plans to decrease their dependency on fossile fuels as well. Just because there's a new pipeline in place, doesn't mean consumption is automatically going to increase as well. In fact, projections show that NS2 is likely never going to be profitable.

US LNG is several times more expensive than Russian gas. And as the last 4 years have shown, the US cannot be fully relied upon either.

I love it when americans explain to europeans what european interests are. 


Let's remember the time when the Americans imposed sanctions on russian gas only to buy it themselves and sell it to us with a premium :
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Paradise-Papers-Reveal-US-Selling-Russian-LNG-In-Europe.html

If the Americans want us to become dependent on their fracking-gas so badly they are welcome to make us a better offer. We're not going to be bullied into a trade deal!


The US uses its power only for its benefit.
And when somebody doesn't want the US, they go crazy, like when Iran wanted to use the Euro for oil instead of the Dollar.

I hope the trade between Germany and Russia is made with the Euro.

But Russia will not just go away either, for Germany Russia is not all that far away, and we have to deal with it one way or another, and if trade can keep things at least somewhat stable between Russia and Germany, that is not a bad thing.

The only substantive trade between the west and Russia at this point is their energy sales to Europe. Trump as a big advocate for US gas exports obviously wanted to end that and ensure Europe as a captive market for the US.  
Outside of cutting off energy income there isn’t much left outside of actual war that can be done to further isolate Russia at this point.

Antagonising Russia and building up sanctions does not work.

By the way, immigration is a net gain because many of them are engineers and doctors. And if they fail in Sweden, that has mostly to do with structural racism. 


Swedish culture is just as toxic and misogynistic as middle eastern cultures.


And let's not discuss volumes and numbers, there is no maximum limit. We could accept 10 million refugees tomorrow, no problem! (Actual quote)


Sweden is safer than ever, the surge in crime is to be blamed on the white middle/upper class who buy drugs. (weed) If people stop using drugs, the criminal gangs will dissappear.


PISA results are GREAT now! We excluded 15% of students from the results, but still, GREAT results!*



This is the actual narrative being fed to us by the media and politicians. People are fed up, but the ingrained fear of being called a racist runs very deep. The debate climate is WAY more reasonable now than 5-10 years ago, but I think it'll take many more years before we are even close to Denmark.

The straights are an international waterway where right of passage is guaranteed, even for Russian Ships, and can be controlled only in formal declarations of war, something that is useless in the nuclear age.   


Despite these setbacks, Turkey was still a slight asset, but only because of 2 reasons:  


1) Kemalist Turkey was a strong western ally.

2) Turkey's Georgaphy made up for the lack of long range capability to effectively contain the Soviet Union with missle defences, and provided potential air superiority in the Caucasus in case of conventional war.

Last time me and my partner flew with Aeroflot was a “never again” moment for me.

Flight from Moscow delayed 6 (!) hours because they opened the engine hoods and couldn’t figure out how to close them. I got this juicy tidbit as I was sitting right next to an Aeroflot technician who was on vacation and he chatted up with the staff.

Turns out a lot of airplane technicians do not in fact know english, and Boeing translates technical manuals for them. I get national pride and all, but english _is_ the lengua franca of the tech world, so not knowing it at this point, especially for safety hardware is nuts.

And all we got for our trouble was about $15 voucher to spend in Sheremetyevo, at night. I only managed to get myself a cup of tea.

And on the way back our flight also got delayed, so much so that they had to switch to Korean Air so we don’t miss our connection, and we nearly did as there was the recent plane crash there that made a huge mess of things. We were in the air, circling, hoping our fuel did not run out. Crazy.

So Aeroflot? Through Moscow? Nah I’d rather pay a bit more and go through somewhere else.

4880,"Here's [another attack on civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Zurayq#1948_War_and_aftermath) from a month before Israel declared independence:

&gt;Abu Zurayq's residents had traditionally maintained cordial relations with the nearby Jewish kibbutz of HaZorea, including low-level economic cooperation, particularly with regards to agriculture. Arabic language versions of a Jewish labor periodical were regularly distributed in the village. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as part of Jewish efforts to clear the area around Mishmar HaEmek of Palestinian Arabs, on 12 April 1948, Palmach units of the Haganah took over Abu Zurayq. There they took 15 men and 200 women and children into custody, after which they expelled all of the women and children. Demolitions of homes in the village began on the night of its capture and were completed by 15 April. The Filastin newspaper reported that of the 30 homes demolished by Palmach forces, five still contained residents.

&gt;According to the account of a Middle East scholar and resident from HaZore'a, Eliezer Bauer, following its capture, Abu Zurayq's men, who were unaffiliated with any Palestinian militia and did not resist the Haganah, ""tried to escape and save themselves by fleeing"" to nearby fields but were intercepted by armed Jewish residents of nearby kibbutzim and moshavim. After a firefight in which many of the village's men were killed, several survivors surrendered themselves while other unarmed men were taken captive, and the majority of these men were killed. Other men found hiding in the village itself were executed, while houses were looted before being demolished. Bauer's account of events was discussed by the members of HaZorea's kibbutz council where the events surrounding Abu Zurayq's capture were condemned.

&gt;Most of the people who managed to escape or were expelled from Abu Zurayq ended up in makeshift camps around Jenin. Along with the expelled residents of other nearby villages they complained to the Arab Higher Committee of their situation, asked for help with humanitarian aid and demanded that Arab forces be sent to avenge their loss and return them to their lands. Following the 1948 war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel, and as of 1992, the land had been left undeveloped and the closest populated place is HaZorea. Much of the village land is used for either agricultural or pastoral purposes. The agricultural land largely consists of cacti, olive and fig trees.

4883,"&gt;the dogma around the gold standard in the late '20s that arguably turned a small recession into a major depression.

""Arguably""? That's putting it mildly. For starters, the great depression happened mostly in the 30. The 20s were famously ""roaring"" and the stock market crash happened in 29, so ""late 20s"" is not correct. There is little (although crucially not ""no"") dispute that the gold standard contributed to the great depression, but it certainly wasn't the only factor, and acting like you know what it would've been without the gold standard, namely a ""small recession"", is dubious at best.

There is no academic agreement about the causes of the great depression, which is par for the course with economics. There's no agreement about anything. Just like there might be people who believe currency stability is a bad thing (who... exactly?), there are definitely a *lot* of people who want the gold standard back, as foolish or wise as that may be. There is certainly a growing sense that neither politicians nor academics are much concerned with preserving monetary wealth beyond what's required for an economy to function. But those people holding money in their accounts aren't willingless puppets. They are very much aware that they're holding on to a depreciating asset. That's what's causing a run on cryptocurrency, among other things. That's not a currency envisioned by the likes of ""modern monetary theory"" enthusiasts, it's much closer to a return of the gold standard, but this time outside of political control.

At the opposite end of the scale, elementary occupations (such as cleaners and helpers, labourers, food preparation assistants, street and related sales and service workers) were the worst paid occupation in all EU Member States, with the exception of Denmark, where service and sales workers earned less.

All in all, mean gross hourly earnings of the best paid occupation in the EU were around three times higher than those of the least well paid occupation. More precisely, the gross hourly earnings of a manager in the EU (€28.6) were almost three times as high as of an elementary worker (€9.7).  
  
Across the EU Member States, this ratio was highest in Cyprus, where managers (€31.7/hour) were paid on average five times as much as elementary workers (€6.3/hour).

Yes, but both countries kept stressing all the time how they value their sovereignity. Brexit was shocking, but not exactly unexpected. With almost 50/50 split on such an important matter, Brexit could've been delayed, but not prevented in its entirety. Think about it: if Scotland could call a referendum any time they want, they'd leave the UK within 20 years inevitably, because at some point the scales would just tip in a moment of weakness. That's the same thing.

Regarding Switzerland, they've always made it very clear they don't want to be a part of EU. So it's really not surprising that they reject certain treaties. If they accepted everything, they could just join EU and be done with formalities.

EU is in a position where it can't be a loose group of members anymore because of economic and legal challenges. Either we go towards a federation, or this whole thing collapses.

5020,"Volkswagen was established in 1937 by the German Labour Front (*Deutsche Arbeitsfront*) in Berlin, in order to mass-produce a low-priced “people’s car (the [Beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle)): a car affordable and practical enough for common people to own. 

Deutsche Arbeitsfront was the labour organisation under the Nazi Party which replaced the various independent trade unions in Germany during Adolf Hitler's rise to power. 

The Austrian automotive engineer Ferdinand Porsche, who was responsible for the original design of the Beetle, was hired by the German Labour Front in 1934, and ground was broken for a new factory in the state of Lower Saxony in 1938. 

The outbreak of World War II in 1939 occurred before mass production could begin, and the factory was repurposed to produce military equipment and vehicles. Volkwagen’s military involvement made its factory a target for Allied bombers, and by the end of the war the factory was in ruins. 

It was rebuilt under British supervision, and mass production of the Volkswagen began in 1946. Control of the company was transferred in 1949 to the West German government and the state of Lower Saxony. By that time, more than half of the passenger cars produced in the country were Volkswagens.",,/r/europe/comments/nmptfb/28_may_1937_volkswagen_the_german_automobile/gzq2a5d/,Vucea,1622176822

The USA was also decentralised and federal, while Russia was extremely centralised on an individual sovereign. The USA was founded by Puritans who encouraged literacy and brought the printing press with them on the boat, while Russia suffered from rampant illiteracy and Serfs were often denied any real education. 


The Americans had a smooth ride into modernity because their ancestors laid the foundations for it. The founders of the US government gave them Division of Powers, Secularism, Peaceful transition of power, and decentralised state authority.

Instead going through canyon left and right for several hours you can go straight through same canyon for half an hour which would bring more tourists, connect villages better and most important taking money from people driving on it ( waiting for day to pay air i breath).

But as you know corona happened and all countries locked which means no money from serbian tourists in montenegro which take big percentages in montenegro GDP ( montenegro is basically living from tourism)

Additionally, 30 years old dictatorship took off.

No, that's ethnic cleansing. It's considered in the past now because it was done as retribution after WW2. While not acceptable by today's standards, you'll notice that a crucial difference is that it was done, and because it didn't create a permanent situation of injustice, everyone has been able to move on. By keeping the occupation and Apartheid alive, the Palestinian conflict can never be lived down, and the region is locked in a perpetual state of war.

5221,"Being (not only) Polish myself the current Turow situation reminds me of an important aspect of polish culture which I call ""getting a second chance"". Let me give you a few examples.

A Polish child fails at school - they get a second (third, fourth) chance, the threshold to pass getting lower each time) and it eventually moves to the next grade within the same group of children.

A student at a Polish university fails an exam - he resits it (and re-resits and re-re-resits) until he passes.

(A catholic person commits a sin and confesses to a priest - the sin is forgiven. ;) )

In my opinion this type of behaviour causes a lot of harm to people by teaching them not to worry until it's too late (I know - it also causes harm to other people around them and to the society as a whole but I don't want to talk about it here).  There usually are no second chances in real life!

Now, back to the problem. The ECJ ruled to close the mine and the Poles ""woke up"" and want to negotiate with the Czech while they had not moved a finger when signs of troubles had been proliferating on the horizon for few years. Sorry! The ship has sailed! Learn to play by the rules and learn to be consequent!

Even in the first days, people would come to the infirmary and ask for tourniquet in order to make slingshot to shoot at the police and we always refused, saying that it's a peaceful protest. I myself washed and cured the feet of a French journalist who travelled all the way to Istanbul to make reports and had bruises. It was all like a big carnival  and a peaceful protest until politicans started to give speeches and turn it into a political campaign. Then the people who was running everything smoothly lost control and one day the flamas of DHKP-C, PKK and so on started to be hanged in high up places, that's when the police multiplied their violance and started to burn the tents. I was there, I've seen it all, I have had a man die in my hands by the gas bomb capcule that hit his skull.

You can have a market without profit motive. The key to having a market is giving patients the choice. You can still have non-profit hospitals and third payer systems.

&gt;For example in Dublin recently some of our bus services were privatized. The same buses are running on the same routes with the same timetables and charging the same fares, only now the drivers are paid less and a private British company makes a tidy profit out of it. It's ridiculous.

5275,"&gt;I can think of almost no other country or bloc that weaponises trade and market access in the same way that the EU does. Their dealings with Switzerland (and the UK) are a perfect example of it.

There simply isn't any other country which offers other countries direct participation of its internal market. There simply isn't. This isn't weaponization. If you want something very very extraordinary, you'll have to put up with the asks of the offering country. The dealings of Switzerland (which understands what it asks) and the UK (which has no idea what it asks) aren't an example for anything you think they are. 

&gt;And by being thuggish about it, they've provoked Switzerland into abandoning the agreement entirely, thereby guaranteeing a never ending negation. Well done EU!

They weren't thuggish. They simply were clear what has to be in the agreement. Basically, Norway, FTA or no way. It's a choice. A choice no other trade bloc/country offers other countries. Offering something which isn't available by anybody else isn't being thuggish. Trying to get the very special deal of the already exceptionally special deal isn't something which has to be granted by the EU.

&gt;Because FTA's are not the same as single market access and represent the binary 0 in a choice the EU offers between 'comprehensive access' and the 'just above the bare minimum', with very little in between. The economically illiterate 'four freedoms' dominates all of their reasoning, and is the basis of their refusal to offer a meaningful compromise. 

The four freedoms are an economic necessity. Otherwise there will always be forces by the producers, labour, capital or service providers complaining that they are especially badly hurt, that the cherry-picked deal is unfair and that one has to be abandon it therefore. This is ecnomics.

&gt;Exported goods that want to enter the single market need to adhere to EU regulation, countries (however) don't. But that's not how the EU deals with other European countries, it seeks to impose EU regulation on the whole country, not just the goods that are being exported (e.g. the TCA, remember how the EU was banging on for the first 4 months of negotiations about 'dynamic alignment'???, In the end the UK settled for something closer to 'non-regression'). 

Dynamic alignment would have gone both ways. Increases in the UKs labour, environmental or other level-playing field related topics would have forced the EU to also increase those regulations or would have allowed the UK to introduce tariffs. Again, this makes sense in the context of a no-tariffs, no-quotas deal. For example if the UK introduces a 20h/week for everyone, the UK will be able to rebalance the deal to deal with the competitive fallout. Same goes for the EU. Non-regression and balancing measures afterwards will achieve exactly the same. You really didn't follow or understand the negotiations at all. 

&gt;Wrong. The EU made the entire TCA contingent on a satisfactory agreement for fisheries. You obviously didn't follow the process closely. 

Negotiations, negotiations my (wo)man... Due to France and Belgium, the EU played hardball. In the end, there would have been a deal with no fisheries and no fish exports either way if the UK would have wanted that. 

&gt;Under international law the EU has NO RIGHT to fish in British waters. But they made every aspect of the future relationship hinge on their continued access - this is completely at odds with any other serious bilateral trade deal between major economies. 

And? The UK has also no right under international law to export its fish to the EU without tariffs or quotas. That's why one negotiates deals. It seems the UK was willing to give up a bit of fish for being able to sell dish. 

Also this isn't at odds. The Norway-UK deal is currently not on track of happening due to fish. Trade deals have been stopped due to far more minor bullshit. 

&gt;No, it isn't. The EU insisted on 'cross-retaliatory' sanctions, so if the UK loosens regulation for one specific sector, the EU can asymmetrically target another - which is ridiculous. 

Yeah, you just described the WTO standard procedure. Obviously ""sanctions"" have to be adjustable. So if someone subsidizes sector X illegally with 10 billions and tariffs wouldn't be able to minimize sector X exports by that amount, than there has to be the option to hurt sector Y by that amount. Welcome to the standard world of trade. 

&gt;Sure, but the UK has a history of promoting free trade and competition, and the EU is the antithesis of both ideas.

Yeah, the EU is the biggest single market and has the most FTAs as well as trade facilitation agreements with third countries in the world. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. The EU is the biggest free trader in the world. 

&gt;This is grade A wank drivel. They 'gave it up for Ireland's sake', give me a break. They used the entire NI issue for leverage in the talks, it was entirely cynical on the part of the Commission.

Okay, there is no help for you. Think for a second logically. NI is worth nothing to the EU. The EU couldn't give less shits about NI. There is no oil, no nothing of any interest. Would any sane person give up control of my one of its external borders to another country for nothing (NI)? Do you hear your argumentation? If Ireland hadn't briefed the shit out of the EU and stated that there would be no-deal in case there is a border, the EU wouldn't have had a problem with a hard border. You are simply delusional.

&gt;Fundamental economics predicts that the eurozone collapses without meaningful risk sharing, a banking union and fiscal transfers. 

Yeah, haven't we heard that for the last 10 years? Let's see. I am no big fan of the Euro. But it seems far more robust than people would have thought.

&gt;You're so glib you're squeaking!

Have a look at the discussions around it by trade experts. The deal is absolutely in favour of Australia. Massive export opportunities for Australia and almost nothing in return for the UK especially in regard to services or anything of importance for the UK economy. The UK will export a bit more Scottish whisky and Australia can compete the UKs agriculture into the ground. Nobody, absolutely nobody expected Australia to get no-tariffs, no-quotas. Somehow the UK gave it away or Australia managed to out-negotiate the UK. 

&gt;It's in everyones interest for the EU to fail and for the continent to build something better (more accountable, less political, more focused on trade and inherently sustainable) than the half baked, bloated, arrogant and ideological monster that exists now

Bloated? The EU has around 50k employees. The UK will have hired more customs agents than that due to brexit. Trade IS political. You see it everywhere. To remove NTBs you need an executive, a legislative body and overarching jurisdiction. That is the only way to get a democratic internal market. More focus on trade? You have a problem with the four freedoms (of trade and labour) and then want more trade? Are you a bit insane? Do you even know what you want? 

&gt;Yeah, because the EU is the only project that can improve trade for Europe...

5303,"Online exchange services? So not cash then....? I am confused why this is an argument for cash? Equally an argument for having bank cards in multiple countries.

Whenever I compared my banks rates to WesternUnion, the banks where slightly better because you didn’t have to pay the “start” fee if you had an account, for cash. When I compared digital exchange rates, well, you would have to compare on the day since they change, and again, my own bank was usually slightly better.

Again, if your banks have a system that needs maintenance so often that’s it’s a problem but they don’t announce it so people don’t know it - that just shows again that the country is behind on technological solutions in regards to paying by bank card. And again, back up fucking cash.

I am not saying that because it never happened to me it didn’t happen. My dad got his bank card flagged and closed on holiday in the US. If you travel often that’s what you tell your bank so they can disable whatever automatic flagging system they have.

In Denmark 16% of all payments in shops were by cash in 2019, down from 23% in 2017. Even amount the 70-79 year olds - the elderly is usually the group used as argument as to why not remove cash - it went down from 40% to 22%.

Cash has loads of benefits, less money laundering being one.

Now, the euro also has benefits, but the smallest one of those should really really be the not having to exchange physical cash.

For example, the EU member states can barely agree on something, issues which even NATO has. An European Government would have hard difficulties passing laws and enforcing it with support of its citizens as it would be. Good example of this would be Belgium, which basically regional party voting blocs, the Flemish people voting Flemish parties and Walloons on Walloon parties. It is very likely that a government would be run by French, German parties and deciding policies for everyone else, (which would also be bad considering how could they decide what is best for each region).

5487,"But I mean if Rutte wants to stay an overcompetitive (because of comparatively too low wages) exporting giant someone has to buy all this stuff, someone has to make the debt. I find this borderline insane to constantly knock the South for enabling the economic policies he pats himself on the back for. I mean lets call him what he is, a mercantilist, an ideology that has for good reason been declared dead 100 to 200 or so years ago.

Germany of course does much of the same but even Merkel rejects Rutte's policy. Rutte is the equivalent to Lindner being chancellor of Germany in which case I would be very worried about the further existence of the EU as we know it (and I'm not talking about positive transformative change ofc). There is no way we can ever make any monetary union work the way Rutte wants it, it's completely out of the question. If it's bettween these policies and abandoning the Euro for good I think the later is vastly more promising, the Euro would probably die anyway if we truly followed Rutte's model. 

It's not about Netherlands=bad. I know many fine people from the Netherlands, it's that some of the ideas of the Dutch government are borderline insane and their entire political scene has been coopted by different flavours of liberal-conservatism. The point is excactly that even Dutch and German citizens would benefit from higher wages. Furthermore we can not keep a monetary union where everyone does as he pleases and expect that everything will be fine in the end. We either need a fiscal union as was always intended or we need to consider is the Euro is really the right model for us. Personally I think the enormous damage of the 2nd option isn't in any way worth it when many of the downsides presented about fiscal union are so purely illusory. Fiscal union means collective responsibility for the benefit of all and stability across the Eurozone. We are already liable for each other, it's time to stop pretending otherwise.

And reading the article that appears to be the case. What he then used those nudes for is despicable if it turns oit to be true but the initial question still remains open to discussion: 'when would asking for nudes' be a disqualification/rape/harassment?'

If a person sends nudes and then feels bad that he or she did and complains.. does this mean it's attempted rape? Harassment?

Iceland doesn't really figure into the arrangement.

I'm simply pointing out that it's only to be expected that EU member countries criticize Ireland for this arrangement, seeing as it makes the EU poorer as a whole. The only member state that winds up being a beneficiary of this arrangement is Ireland. They wind up building a huge chunk of their economy on funds that would, under more normal circumstances, instead be helping to strengthen the EU as a whole.

The adoption of the Euro, along with EU membership, have utterly transformed the country in mostly positive ways. Irish people are very supportive of EU membership in general because it has A) lifted us out of the economic abyss, B) helped us escape British and Catholic domination, and C) allowed us to grow into a more confident and prosperous nation. You have to remember that Ireland has only been independent for 100 years, and for at least 70 of those years we essentially swapped colonial oppression for theocratic oppression. It's still a young country, very much still in a postcolonial mindset and not as confident in itself as its more mature Western European neighbours such as the UK and France.

You country has mostly been booming economically post WW II and still has low density. The illegal immigration you get from the border goes straight into the labour sector. Because of conservative policies (and democratic ones pre 2000's as well), there's very little welfare structure for non-citizens, so immigrants, both legal and illegal, have to work or starve. That's not the case in Europe, there's much more generous welfare state here.
