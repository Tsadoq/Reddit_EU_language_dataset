6,"General elections are by no means the only requirement for democracy, as we understand it today (as opposed to ancient greek etc.).   
Other requirements are:

* A steady constitution (to protect minorities)
* Free flow of information (for constituents to make self-responsible decisions)
* Separation of power (Government does not control legislation and jurisdiction)

We have seen all of these points being attacked by the various 'leaders' mentioned in the photo. On the top of my head I can think of: Orban tries to control the media/education, Trump tried to delegitimize them. Kaczynski tries to get rid of separation of power by relieving judges of their duty and appointing loyalists. Erdogan tries to rewrite the constitution. And Putin basically all of them. I'm sure you can find examples for all of these guys gnawing at these principles.

Extreme example: In the first German republic Hitler's party was elected with strong majorities in general elections. When they came into power there were still elections, but they already controlled the media (Gleichschaltungsgesetz) and were destroying checks and balances in the parliament and the judicial branch. 

Back then they were just less subtle than the autocrats of today. Modern 'strong leaders' have learned from the past.",,/r/europe/comments/ll030a/d√ºsseldorf_carnival_2021/gnmrbd6/,alxfry,1613469269

139,"&gt; Because ""Nazism"" isn't defined by building hospitals, schools, and general welfare for for everyone, but especially the poorest and most vulnerable.

The nazis would have said so. 

&gt;  It's popularly defined by mass murder.

*We* define it that way, because the nazis did mass murder. And when you do mass murder, we cease to give a shit about all the nice things you did for the German people. As we should. 

In just the same way, the commies did mass murder, and when they did that, everyone except commies ceased to care about anything else about communism. As they should. 

The only people who look past the mass murder are commies, because they want to make excuses for communism. No one else is willing to look past the mass murder, because *mass murder is a thing that we ought not to look past*. 

Commies in the early 20th century can be excused, because the mass murder hadn't happened yet, just as Nazis in 1920 could be excused. Nazis in 1945, and communists in the 21st century, cannot. 

**To be a 21st century communist is to be a mass murder apologist, and nothing else significant.** There is no excuse.

176,"Precisely because it is a supermetro is why it can stop at small places.

A metro only stops at places where people want to be, so I won't stop at small places. However a supermetro works like an airplane, so a supermetro doesn't need to be at the destination. It can also be somewhat near a large area, with the assumption that people will travel to the supermetrostation using local transport; much like they do with airplanes.

In that sense the distance Hamburg--Amsterdam is rather large, meaning everyone living in the middle (which is still quite a lot of Dutch and German people) would have to travel for hours before they reach a supermetrostation. While Emmen (or Zwolle etc) are not interesting on their own, they can be used to reflect the entirety of North-East Netherlands and half of Niedersachsen and Nordrhein-Westfalen, which may well be worth it.

That is also why I say the supermetrostation should be in Utrecht rather than Amsterdam; if it is in Amsterdam then travel to/from Amsterdam is very smooth but to e.g. Rotterdam takes much longer and the metro has to pass straight through heavily populated places. If the supermetrostation is a little bit east of Utrecht than it in in a rural area (hence there is space to build a station) and while travel to/from Amsterdam would take half an hour more, travel to/from Rotterdam would take a similar time less.",Utrecht (Netherlands) ,/r/europe/comments/lkb3ct/imaginary_concept_of_a_paneuropean_rail_network/gnmkj2r/,WeabPep,1613462864

Nazis weren't anti-theist. This is some religious propaganda bullshit trying to paint nazis as atheists, that even you contradict in your next sentence.

What they might have been was anti-church in that, just like communists in Russia, they didn't want to compete with the church for power.

328,"You're right that civil and common law aren't fundamentally divided by existence of a constitution, but I think that you may also have a bit of confusion: there are two unrelated things that ""civil law"" means, and I think that you may have in mind the wrong one for this context.

This is the one that the map is talking about:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)

&gt;Civil law is a legal system originating in mainland Europe and adopted in much of the world. The civil law system is intellectualized within the framework of Roman law, and with core principles codified into a referable system, which serves as the primary source of law. The civil law system is often contrasted with the common law system, which originated in medieval England, whose intellectual framework historically came from uncodified judge-made case law, and gives precedential authority to prior court decisions.[1]

This is the one I think that you are thinking of, which relates to wrongs related to property rights:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)

&gt;Civil law is a major branch of the law.[1] In common law legal systems such as England and Wales and the United States, the term refers to non-criminal law.[1][2] The law relating to civil wrongs and quasi-contracts is part of the civil law,[3] as is law of property (other than property-related crimes, such as theft or vandalism).[4]",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ljtut8/legal_systems_in_europe/gnm0msr/,duisThias,1613448447
329,"TLDR: Minister of Healthcare announces results of survey- 2.8 million people want a COVID-19 vaccine. MoH also says that any person can choose their preferred vaccine (Pfizer/Moderna/AZ), so we order 2 million doses of each (presumably preference will be evenly split by means of black magic). 
January- United Kingdom has amazing rollout, while Pfizer‚Äôs having temporary setbacks; MoH increases AZ order to 4.5 million doses (cause panic + ‚Äòthey‚Äôre gonna be faster&amp;cheaper‚Äô)
Few weeks ago- AZ vaccine is announced to be less effective than Pfizer/Moderna towards new variants, this is blown out of proportion and people start thinking that the AZ vaccine is shit (it‚Äôs not), MoH (again due to panic) increases mRNA vaccines order to a combined 7 million, but due to poor logistics, we still only receive about 25k Pfizer and 10k Moderna per week. Meanwhile AZ is coming in at 50k+ per week, but people don‚Äôt want it as much, so it‚Äôs not being used up immediately like the other two and starts stockpiling slightly.

The usual estimation for the period in the entire continent is well over **50 million mostly european immigrants**, not only 30. Both image and table seem to ignore the huge migration to latin America, the second biggest in the world for the period after US, which distorts the result greatly.

The map estimation is extremely low surpassed in both cases by Argentina or Brazil alone, countries that got many more immigrants also than Canada+Australia+New Zealand. The great migration to Cuba is also ignored despite being bigger than south african, siberian or algerian which are however mentioned. **For entire Ibero-America the total number of migrants for that period is probably close to 15 million**.

\- [Argentina](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inmigraci%C3%B3n_en_Argentina#Origen_de_los_inmigrantes_hasta_1940) got **over 6.6 million** immigrants in that period (close to 5 million counting only italians and spaniards, +1 million french, germans, jews, poles, russians, etc). 

\- [Brazil](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imigra%C3%A7%C3%A3o_no_Brasil#Impacto_da_imigra%C3%A7%C3%A3o) received **over 4.5 million** (3 million only counting portuguese, italians and spaniards, but also hundreds of thousands germans, poles, ukrainians, etc)

\- Over 1 million europeans arrived to Uruguay, Chile and Venezuela. Some hundred thousands more (probably another million) including rest of the south-american countries.

\- Before and specially after Independence, Cuba received over 2 million immigrants (more than half spaniards, hundreds of thousands from other Antilles islands).

361,"In common law, precedent has a greater importance relative to legislation than it does in civil law.

In common law, courts are adversarial.  You have two lawyers, each acting to present the case from their own client's standpoint.  The judge is largely a passive participant who listens to the arguments of each and then rules.  If you've seen American TV shows or movies, you may have seen dramatized common law courtrooms.  In civil law, I understand that judges are more active participants, coming up with and asking questions to try to investigate the matter.
Juries are more frequently-used in common law then in civil law.

The impression I have is that I good way to summarize would be that common law is more decentralized and relies less on governmental institutions.  In common law,  citizens play a larger role in making decisions relative to judges than in civil law.  Lawyers play a larger role relative to judges in directing the course of a trial than in civil law.  Judges play a larger role relative to legislators than in civil law.  Each of those has a larger group play a more-prominent role in common law than they do in civil law.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ljtut8/legal_systems_in_europe/gnm2tne/,duisThias,1613449730

371,"&gt;I mean, then I can agree when you say the Netherlands is boring.

No.  No.  No.  I keep getting misinterpreted.  The Netherlands is far from boring and is an absolute beautiful little country with beautiful cities, towns, museums and tons to do.  I highly recommend going to visit.  I enjoyed myself immensely.

What I am saying is that the Netherlands does not have much NATURAL beauty (as seen in the OP pic) compared to most other countries.  Which is strange to me as an American because the Netherlands has a seashore which seems underused and not as touristy or good for viewing wildlife as comparable places in the United States and Europe.

&gt;Also, why did you go along the coast of Holland?

A friend and I had a week to spare and we decided to see the coastal cities as we had both been to Amsterdam and Rotterdam.  We were driving down through Hamburg and Bremen from Denmark.  I had relatives that lived in Western Germany for many, many years so I was able to visit the area often.

&gt;the Netherlands holds around the same territory as South Carolina.

Exactly, but with many, many more people (17 million to 5 million).  Taking this example of the Netherlands to South Carolina you can see the difference between them in Natural Beauty.  South Carolina has Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach, 2 of the most desirable touristy beach areas in the country.  South Carolina is filled with estuaries filled with migrating birds and wildlife.  There's whale watching offshore.  Inland there are hills and eastern forests filled with natural beauty.  The Netherlands doesn't have this simply because so much of it is man made land.",,/r/europe/comments/ljoc8p/the_netherlands_looks_like_an_old_masters/gnm3jy1/,Incunebulum,1613450160

I personally don't believe in collective responsibility for centuries old historical events. If we for the sake of argument assumed such anyways or if I did then certainly the U.S. would share some responsibilities. That's not really under contention. Certainly there's no shortage of people today that believe as much and moan about the evils of dead white (American) men, Andrew Jackson, and the Trail of Tears endlessly. But then, whatever responsibilities, that's just a lesson on what not to do. Not a lesson in well America did it so we should too, or at least be complacent.

What I objected to is the post I replied to with the bizarre implication that America is uniquely immoral for having some colonial history and therefore should criticize no one abetting what's going on in China right now.

With opposition leader Alexei Navalny in custody, his associates have been stepping in to organize protests across Russia to maintain pressure on the Kremlin. [Leonid Volkov,](https://www.dw.com/en/russia-orders-arrest-of-top-aide-to-alexei-navalny/a-56522931) a close ally to Navalny, toold DW's Russian service that the protest movement's strategy is to improvise in order to be flexible and ""outsmart Putin.""

""I don't want to and can't say anything specific about the format. It will always be something new, something different,"" Volkov said.

## Navalny ally Volkov: 'Our strategy is to be flexible and to be smart'

Volkov was instrumental in organizing [Valentine's Day protests](https://www.dw.com/en/russia-navalny-supporters-hold-valentines-day-protests/a-56565484) by calling for the demonstrations on Twitter.

Supporters of Navalny held candle-lit minidemonstrations in residential courtyards across Russia on Sunday evening. Protesters used a new method of demonstrating by using the flashlight function on their smartphones and arranging candles in the shape of a heart. The action took place under the motto ""Love is stronger than fear.""

""Be sure to tell your stories after the action: How did you decide to get out? Were you the first in your yard or did you join someone? Have you met new like-minded people? These stories are perhaps even more important than the flashlight encounters themselves,"" he tweeted.

## New efforts to pressure Putin

Volkov said protesters' strategy was to ramp up pressure on Putin and to grow the number of supporters. He added that leaders want to ""help supporters to organize themselves and not yield to Putin's strategy of fear and smear campaign.""

""So far we have been very successful and I think will remain quite successful in the future,"" Volkov said.

Navalny was arrested last month upon his return from Germany, where he was being [treated for poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok](https://www.dw.com/en/navalny-aide-warns-against-broad-sanctions-on-russia-over-poisoning/a-55020936). He was jailed on February 2 for violating the conditions of a 2014 suspended sentence.

His¬†[arrest and subsequent imprisonment](https://www.dw.com/en/russias-alexei-navalny-faces-more-jail-time-in-slander-case/a-56544202) has spurred weeks of nationwide protests resulting in the arrests of thousands of demonstrators.",,/r/europe/comments/lko7fn/navalny_ally_leonid_volkov_our_aim_is_to_outsmart/gnkudee/,TouchAlert,1613426114

771,"&gt;France has been quite expansionist historically, and because it was very centralized and culturally dominant for so long it has kept all the new territory. Russia or China, for example, gained a lot more territory but if you look at the population profile, until about 50 years the new territories could have been removed very easily because the original populations weren't assimilated (Tibet, Xinjiang, Siberia, etc).

I don't think these comparisons really work, though. France is much smaller than Russia or China, and it's also much more culturally homogeneous. Sure, there are basque, celtic and germanic people who were assimilated in France. But if you look at the history, all those people had a deeply intertwined history since Roman times if not before. Culture isn't just about language.

It's not a story of ""France gets your territory and starts assimilating you"", it's much more complex than that. And it didn't result in a simple one-way assimilation either. There wasn't a big french blob that blobified its surroundings. The idea of ""France"" as a country populated by french people isn't much older than the Renaissance, and even then being french meant a variety of things.

Let's also remember than in France, nationalism historically had little to do with ethnicity, and a lot more with democracy and human rights. Right at the same time when other countries promoted the greatness of their ""race"", France was obsessed with regionalism, folklorism, local languages revival. They chose a celtic people as mythical ancestors. Redditors are fed propaganda about how France forced everyone to learn ""common"" french in school, but that wasn't the point at all: the point was giving free, non-religious education to every kid in the country. That education was in ""common"" french because that way everyone had access to the same level of education, and could travel the country. It wasn't about making France more homegenenous - quite the opposite in fact. The goal was to make sure everyone could be on the same level.

When we see in the news that a school opened in an african country to teach english to the kids, people don't think ""oh no they are assimilating them to english culture!"", they think ""now the kids will have access to education etc"". France gets a lot of bad press for its supposed ""assimilation"" policies, when in reality it was a country with population that were diverse but had a lot in common ; and with time and centralization evolved in a more united entity, but still shows a lot of internal diversity.",,/r/europe/comments/lk1ou6/how_france_got_its_shape/gnkgcgd/,Cato_Mageor,1613419400

Salafi groups on the other hand are more connected to Saudi Arabia AFAIK, and quite a bit different and even more dangerous. 

That these have merged are a very big claim that I would take with a grain of salt, it would require an in-depth socio-political analysis. My suspision is that they are throwing the term around a bit, and should be more distinct regarding the intricacies of these movements if they want to analyse and respond effectively. 

It could also be the case that Salafist-sympathizers are turning into Erdogan-Islamists, which they have worded as a merger, when it‚Äôs more of a change than merger.

803,"Pandemic management is really bad, through. Last week of March'20 was declared as 'week off'. Imagine audience reaction - they've treated it exact way (it is week off, not lockdown!) and started to spread Covid from Moscow across the country. Official lockdown in regions lasted to mid summer, however, actual lockdown was never implemented, and strict measures lasted only for 2 or 3 weeks. After that, many workers were called back into offices (factory workers never stopped to work). And in beginning of May (at the new cases rising) it was announced that 'federation-wide measures starting to loose up'. People hadn't heard about second part of story 'regions continue to maintain measures' and went out on streets the same day of announcement.

Mask wearing is still mandatory at workplace, mandatory in public places, mandatory on parkings etc. Yet, in my region, you can meet 10% at max who wear mask at all, and 2-3% who do it correctly. People go to the resorts, ski, mountains, and bring covid to their homes.

Hospitals do their best not to acknowledge covid cases even with evident symptoms. Many of my acquaintances caught covid in clinics' coridors.

809,"You are so uninformed it is pointless continuing to have this conversation.   Black people are less likely to be killed by police per police interaction, they just interact with the police a lot more because they are more criminal.  And your ""study"" wasn't actually a study, it was a review and opinion piece.  It never linked a source for the 5x drug use in white people.  It probably used raw numbers instead of per capita and that is why they didn't link it.  Basically, you provided a piss poor opinion piece.  The only thing I agree with them on is that the war on drugs needs to stop.

You keep bringing up high death rates not being justified, but they don't actually have high rates compared to white people. Overall more black people are killed, but they also interact with the police far more.  So if have a random black and white person, the white person would actually be more likely to be killed by the police if he/she interacts with them.  It seems you have difficulty understanding this fact.  

A group which commits 50% of the murders while only being 13% of the population ends up being killed by police, who would have thought?  And even then, the vast majority were armed and dangerous and there was nothing wrong with it.  There is no epidemic of white police killing black people.  

You seem to have a hard time understanding the facts.  A highly criminal demographic is more involved in the justice system, who would have thought!?  Did you read the paper where murders skyrocketed in areas where police pulled back because of protests demanding they be defined and leave the community alone?  Did you even read the link I sent?

You seem slow on the uptake.  You seem like you are more interested in keeping a narrative alive instead of admitting the facts.  Let me just tell you that you are wrong, misinformed, and far less humble than you should be with your level of knowledge.

I am nonschalant about pretty much everything due to congenital mental disorder. I am incapable to act against my nature.

&gt; You are literally playing down the situation as not important

Because in grand scheme it really isn't important.

&gt; And that is true, but then if the situation is so unimportant, then why is it okay for the government to prosecute this person?

It is not okay.

&gt; A edgy guy who made a joke, why is it not a big deal that he was legally punished by the government for it?

Because consequences of it are not big deal. He lost some time and money. How does it affect world? Even if you consider it becoming new precedent and every edgy guy who makes racist joke getting fined, it doesn't have significant impact.

&gt; Should the government just be able to punish you for trivial things that shouldn't be illegal but it's whatever, it's just some fine?

No.

&gt; If you fail to see it is a joke then you either have a powerfull dogma, you didn't look into the situation and see his responses at all, or you're dim witted.

997,"&gt; Not only because it hurts the physical fitness

So, I'll buy that someone needs equipment to train very specific things.  Like, this is unquestionably a pain if you're a bodybuilder and aiming for to build specific muscles.

But for general wellness, you do not need equipment to exercise.  People here jog a fair bit.  In elementary school, I recall us being taught to do [burpees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burpee_(exercise\)), among other calisthenics.  You don't need a lot of space and need to hardware to do burpees.

I mean, especially in summer, if the gym has air conditioning ‚Äî dunno what the situation is like in Europe there ‚Äî I can imagine wanting to  exercise in an air-conditioned environment.  But we're in the middle of a cold snap right now in Europe ‚Äî that doesn't seem to likely be an issue.

And, hell, while I can understand it being a nice convenience, everybody went without air conditioning until less than a century ago.  And there are even people who enjoy doing heat challenges, like [that group who does runs in summer in Death Valley](http://darthvalley.heatrunning.com/) dresses as Darth Vader and Chewbacca.  I'm not one of them, but I can handle exercise without A/C.

&gt; and the mental/social needs of the participants

I mean, that's exactly what the restrictions are designed to *do*.  To limit how many people someone physically comes in contact with.  Can hang out on the phone or computer with people, but they're trying to get people to not be physically in the same space with each other to limit spread.

&gt; but also because many sport establishments will not survive this

Well, that may be a legit complaint, but I'm pretty sure that the argument for ""the government should subsidize gyms to ensure continuity"" is separate from ""should gyms be open right now"".

&gt; when they fall away people will no longer be able to do sport

If an establishment goes under and there is demand, a new one will show up.  It's like with restaurants ‚Äî they go out of business all the time, and new ones show up.

For the US:

https://www.perrygroup.com/foodservice-expert-overview-on-how-long-restaurants-last/

&gt;It was concluded from both our analysis and the studies that the majority of restaurants usually fail in the first year. Of those restaurants and foodservice businesses that made it beyond a year, 70% failed within the next 3 to 5 years. Of those that made it beyond then, 90% remained successful and stayed in business longer than 10 years. There is a more recent article this week in The News Press that reports similar results that our foodservice expert report concluded more than a dozen years ago. This excerpt, along with the full story, shows times have not really changed that much as a restaurant management consultant and what you can learn from these Florida restaurateurs: ‚ÄúAccording to therestaurantbrokers.com, the average restaurant‚Äôs life span is five years with up to 90 percent of independently owned restaurants closing in year one.

That's a pretty brutal attrition rate.  But are there no restaurants out there?  No, because new ones also show up to serve the demand at a rapid rate.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/lkews7/people_in_lithuania_stage_outdoor_training_to/gnjnbq5/,duisThias,1613405561

1004,"&gt;Guess all European courts are retards then

Many experts in Spain warned back then that German and Belgian judges weren't understanding the European order of extradition. Instead of deciding if the accused subjects were suspect of breaking the Spanish laws suggested by the Spanish Supreme Court, they decided if they would have broken German or Belgian laws had they done the same in Germany or Belgium.

As Germany and Belgium have different penal codes in which the equivalent of sedition requires different actions for Germany or simply doesn't exist for Belgium, they decided to set them free.

However, those **German or Belgian judges never said they didn't commit the crimes they were accused of**. They simply said that those actions didn't match any crime in their own countries and understood they shouldn't be extradited.

Europe‚Äôs most prominent federalist has accused Ursula von der Leyen of overseeing a ‚Äúdiplomatic disaster‚Äù that has wrecked relations between the EU and Britain.

Guy Verhofstadt, the senior liberal MEP and former Belgian prime minister, attacked the European Commission president for making the EU‚Äôs vaccines ‚Äúfiasco‚Äù worse with panicked measures.

Proposals personally driven by the leader of the European Commission to reintroduce a hard Irish border as part of export restrictions last month have, he said, poisoned relations with Britain and undermined years of work.

‚ÄúThe use of the Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol has been a diplomatic disaster that destroyed in a few seconds the seriousness of the negotiations with the UK conducted by Michel Barnier for more than three years,‚Äù said Verhofstadt, who was the European parliament‚Äôs former Brexit negotiator.

Verhofstadt, 67, accused Von der Leyen, 62, of ‚Äúprolonging drastically the Covid pandemic on mainland Europe‚Äù at a huge cost to lives and the economy.

He is incensed that, while 75 per cent of vaccines are made on European territory, the commission‚Äôs bungled procurement contracts have led to a scarcity.

‚ÄúThe EU is a world leader in producing vaccines yet there is a lack of supply in every EU country. It‚Äôs a lack not seen in the same dramatic proportions in the US, Canada or the UK. In the US nearly 10 per cent of the population has had a first shot. In Britain it‚Äôs 20 per cent,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe need to renegotiate, with binding commitments and mandatory timelines, and speed up authorisation of upcoming vaccines.‚Äù

‚ÄúA fiasco I called it and a fiasco it is. After two months the rollout of vaccines is dramatically low in Europe. On average no more than 4 per cent of European citizens received a first dose,‚Äù he said at the weekend.

‚ÄúThe introduction of new export authorisation for Covid vaccines adds only unnecessary burdens and by doing so prolongs and doesn‚Äôt speed up vaccinations.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/lke56t/ursula_von_der_leyens_covid_vaccine_disaster_has/gnj8tht/,quixotic_cynic,1613397420

France has stepped up criticism of Britain‚Äôs vaccination strategy by attacking its focus on distributing first doses, which provide some immunity. The √âlys√©e Palace insists that in reality the French are beating the British in the vaccine race.

‚ÄúThe British are going faster because they have relied heavily on the first injection. If we take a look at the number of people who have had both injections in the UK and the EU, France included, we see that the number of fully vaccinated people is lower in the UK,‚Äù said Cl√©ment Beaune, the French Europe minister, today.

‚ÄúThe British have taken more risks, which has allowed them to go faster. What is happening in the UK is not something I would like to have here. It‚Äôs a strategy of massive vaccination with more risks.‚Äù

**Germany can look back on a long history of migration. Emigration flows dominated until the late 19th century. After that, the migration direction increasingly shifted and various migration flows to Germany occurred during the 20th and 21st century.**

Migration Flows during the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries
The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) led to serious destruction and a significant reduction in population in some German regions. The respective sovereigns therefore recruited employable and tax-paying people from other overpopulated regions who were looking to settle in the war-ravaged areas (""population policies""). As a result, they transformed into Central European immigration regions. Religious refugees from other parts of Europe were also drawn to early modern Germany. The largest as well as economically, culturally and politically most significant group of immigrants were the Huguenots. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1598) in 1685, thirty to forty thousand Huguenots immigrated to the German territories, primarily north of the Main River (especially to Brandenburg-Prussia, Hessen-Kassel, the Guelph Duchies and the Hanseatic Cities).[1]

After these immigration flows, which continued until the middle of the 18th century, the continental emigration to Eastern and Southeast Europe prevailed until the 1830s while transatlantic emigrations, especially to the United States, were predominant until the late 19th century. From the 1680s to the year 1800, more than 740,000 people emigrated from German-speaking regions to Eastern, Central Eastern and Southern Europe. And from 1816 to 1914, more than 5.5 million German emigrants departed for the United States. There, from 1820 to 1860, German immigrants represented the second-largest group of all immigrants behind the Irish at around 30 percent; from 1861 to 1890, they were even the largest. The extensive expansion of economic opportunities due to high industrialization and agricultural modernization in Germany as well as the economic crisis in the United States finally led to a significant reduction in transatlantic migration flows.

Flight and Forced Labor during and between the Wars
The ""Century of Refugees"" began, starting with World War I. The Weimar Republic became the destination for hundreds of thousands of refugees who escaped the aftermath of the Russian Revolution in October of 1917, the subsequent civil war and the implementation of the Soviet system. The same fate was shared by tens of thousands of Eastern European Jews who were looking for protection from pogroms and anti-Semitic developments in many parts of Eastern Central, South Eastern and Eastern Europe. With the National Socialists‚Äô rise to power, Germany yet again ‚Äì as before World War I ‚Äì became an asylum-opposed state. The new rulers also cast out more than half a million people. This affected political opponents of the regime, those who the regime deemed to be opponents and especially all those who were being increasingly dehumanized and persecuted due to the racist ideology of National Socialism. Primarily, it was the Jews of whom about 280,000 to 330,000 were able to flee the Reich from 1930 to 1940. Approximately 195,000 German Jews, who were not (or no longer) able to escape, were murdered by the end of the war. Only about 15,000 to 20,000 survived the camps or remained hidden in the Reich. Asylum for those refugees was granted by more than 80 states worldwide; frequently ‚Äì and increasingly during the 1930s ‚Äì this occurred with reluctance and hesitation because the people seeking refuge from Germany were perceived to be a burden on the economy and social security systems, especially against the backdrop of the Great Depression.",,/r/europe/comments/lke74k/historical_and_current_development_of_migration/gnj94uy/,quixotic_cynic,1613397625

**""Guest Worker"" Recruitment, the Labor Recruitment Ban and Family Reunification**

During the 1950s and 1960s, the young Federal Republic of Germany experienced an economic boom which went hand in hand with an enormous expansion of the labor market. Since the domestic workforce was no longer sufficient to cover demand, Germany entered into the first agreements for the recruitment of workers with Italy in 1955, and with Greece and Spain in 1960. Treaties with Turkey (1961), Morocco (1963), Portugal (1964), Tunisia (1965) and Yugoslavia (1968) followed suit. The migrant workers generally assumed unskilled labor and positions with minimal training requirements in industrial production with high physical stress, health burdens and wage conditions that many locals were not willing to accept (anymore). The recruitment of so-called ""guest workers"" was terminated during the oil (price) crisis and due to increasing unemployment in 1973. Yet, this decision can also be ascribed to the increased permanent settlement of foreign workers in the self-proclaimed 'non-immigrant country' of Germany. From the late 1950s until the stop in labor recruitment in 1973, approximately 14 million foreign workers came to Germany, of whom 11 million only stayed in the country temporarily and eventually returned to their home countries. The others remained and their families joined them. Because of this development, the number of foreign workers decreased after the end of the recruitment period ‚Äì from 2.6 million in 1973 to 1.6 million in 1989 ‚Äì but the foreign population grew from 3.97 million to 4.9 million during the same period.

**Immigration in Unified Germany: Asylum Migration and the Influx of Ethnic German Resettlers in the 1980s and 1990s**

With the opening of the ""Iron Curtain"", the transformation of the political systems in the former states of the ""Eastern Bloc"" and the collapse of the GDR in 1989/90, the migration patterns in Europe drastically changed. In Germany, the number of asylum applications rose significantly, especially from Eastern, Central Eastern and Southern Europe. It surpassed 100,000 in 1988, climbed to approximately 120,000 in 1989 (the year of the European Revolutions), reached 190,000 in unified Germany in 1990, and finally soared to almost 440,000 by 1992 (see ""Flight and Asylum"").

In addition to the immigration of asylum seekers, the number of ethnic German resettlers increased significantly in the Federal Republic of Germany in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The designation ""resettler"" comes from the early 1950s. After the end of refuge and displacement caused by World War II, approximately four million ethnic Germans still lived in Eastern, Central Eastern and Southeastern Europe in 1950, according to official numbers. The Federal Expellee Law from 1953 assured them acceptance as German citizens. Between 1950 and 1975, a total of 800,000 ethnic German resettlers, and between 1976 and 1987 616,000 more passed through West German Border Transit Centers for Resettlers. Then, once the ""Iron Curtain"" was lifted, their mass immigration set in: Starting in 1987 and against the backdrop of ""Glasnost"" and ""Perestroika"" in the USSR, the numbers quickly increased and more than three million resettlers came to the Federal Republic of Germany in the subsequent 15 years. In total, 4.5 million ethnic German resettlers immigrated to Germany between 1950 and 2016.",,/r/europe/comments/lke74k/historical_and_current_development_of_migration/gnj99gi/,quixotic_cynic,1613397706

**Current Developments**

Immigration reached its first climax in reunified Germany in 1992. During that year, more than 1.5 million people immigrated to the Federal Republic of Germany, while 720,000 left the country. The result is net migration of approximately 782,000. During the following years, immigration significantly decreased. Statistically speaking, Germany was an emigration country in 2008 and 2009: The number of people leaving the country was higher than those arriving from abroad. Since 2010, the influx of migrants has been increasing again. In 2015, immigration was at its highest in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany especially due to the large influx of asylum seekers (cf. Fig. 1).[2]

In 2015, a total of 2.14 million people immigrated to Germany, while approximately 998,000 people left the country during the same period. This results in a migration surplus of approximately 1.14 million people. Over the past few years, the majority of immigrants arrived from European countries, especially from EU member states. One exception was the year 2015. Due to the large number of asylum seekers from countries outside of Europe, the share of citizens of the European Union among all immigrants was only around 40 percent.[3] Syria was the main country of origin of new immigrants, ahead of Romania and Poland (cf. Fig. 2).

**The Immigrant Population**

An analysis of the immigrants and their descendants who since 2005 are also statistically recorded as ""population with a migration background"", underlines how greatly immigration has shaped the population of the country in past and present. According to the definition applied by the Federal Statistics Office, a person is considered someone with a migration background ""if they themselves or at least one parent did not obtain German citizenship through birth"" (loose translation).[4] According to the results of the micro-census in 2016, more than 18.6 million people living in Germany (22.5 percent of Germany's population) have a migration background. That includes nine million foreign nationals (10.9 percent of the population) as well as 9.6 million Germans (11.7 percent of the population). Most people with a migration background are of Turkish or Polish descent (15.1 percent and 10.1 percent respectively) or come from the Russian Federation (6.6 percent).

The regional distribution of the population with migration background varies. Among the old West German states, especially the city states of Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin, as well as the federal states of Hesse, Baden-Wurttemberg and North Rhine Westphalia have a high percentage of persons with a migration background: Immigrants and their descendants represent more than 26 percent of the population of these states. In contrast, the share of persons with migration background is less than seven percent in all the ""New L√§nder"" (cf. Fig. 3).",,/r/europe/comments/lke74k/historical_and_current_development_of_migration/gnj9db0/,quixotic_cynic,1613397774

1053,"i would never say that other products have a ""universal design language"". Or should have. But i can certainly explain what i mean with ""soulless"". I mean that the Facades all look kinda the same, with no real original selling points. That the Windows are either facing the wrong directions (i.e. onto other windows), or are too large so you can see the whole flat from street level. The Greenery is new, so i cant criticize too much on that, but its still underwhelming. Even if i imagine the trees fully grown. The park is just one flat area, designed to discourage ""cornering"" and make camera surveillance easier. And everything is really windy, which is no surprise at the waterfront, but could have been circumvented by building some nooks and corners with benches. But the most horrible thing is the Facade facing the heating plant. 10 meters in front of the windows you have that big industrial chimney. And, ofc, the concept for small owner-managed stores did not go well, the rent was much too expensive from the start. And with some buildings i really wondered when they are going to finish, just to find out that it already is, it is supposed to look like a building site!

Interestingly enough, in both cases it was the Italian police and judiciary systems that found and prosecuted the illegal activity, even if the funds were from the EU.
Also the video was from 2015, and it does not state ""almost all the money ends up in the hands of mafia"". One of the public officials interviewed said that, in that territory (Mineo, not Italy), any activity worth money will become interest of mafia.

In any case, that's a practical argument that doesn't really speak to the moral value of self-determination. The secession of the US from the British Empire did indeed contribute to the collapse of the Empire, but would that mean that the US did not have a right to govern themselves? Similarly, the secession of Algeria did great damage to France, but does that mean that you support a re-annexation of Algeria by France?

The constitution of Spain is indeed very recent, and I think it's a good argument against secession that it was put in place not many generations from now - Catalans are alive today who were alive when it was signed.

I am 100% in favor of letting people file applications from other countries and refugee camps, and when approved they can be brought here safely. But in order to make such a system work, we would then also need to lock down our borders, to prevent unfair treatment, since if we still allow people in at the border then, an application from another country or refugee camps makes little sense. And locking down those borders means pushing people back, which is not a nice sight of course, but in my opinion the better evil compared to what we have now.

1218,"Definitely, although it's hard to make a number on it: OLAF is the office at EU level that does some of the investigations, but there are also national authorities. And OLAF makes recommendations that then have to be implemented, and it does not report on that.
The implementation is usually national law enforcement duty. 
Just looking up with no efforts, and looking at one country, Italy, I found something like 15 million euros of frozen funds linked to three different cases (all in 2019). It pretty much depends on national authorities (contrary to what the OP claims), and in Italy they do work a lot on this side. 
If you are a fraudster, the only way not to give back EU funds is to cash it and disappear for good. It can be done, but the cost is quite high
basically, it is somewhat easy to steal/misuse Eu funds, but it's really hard to get away with it without paying a price: in my country, where we have a high EU funds scamming rate, recovering the misappropriated funds is a normal activity for law enforcement agencies, worth several million euros every year",,/r/europe/comments/ljnw9d/are_eu_funds_an_amplifier_of_corruption_in_its/gnirxtv/,The3lm,1613383115

1227,"No. And there are two reasons for that.

First off, it's natural for any and all businesses to centralize to only one location. The only barrier to this is logistics, and microelectronics are very logistics friendly so it's natural for the entire world's microelectronics manufacturing to concentrate to a single city. This gives them easier access to relevant competence, the supply chain that they need access to already ends there and so on. You also end up getting a financial culture that's used to assessing and investing in microelectronics there. Only lasting disruptions will break this advantage effect, and COVID is not a sufficiently lasting disruption. These companies have no natural reason to branch out.


The second reason is that microelectronics is geopolitics. It's not a luxury product that is easy for your country to do without. It's a critical part of both defense and of most other industries today. Countries have a vested interest in controlling these as foreign countries become dependant on you then and less likely to act against your interest.


Furthermore, if you for whatever reason want to branch out you are likely to look to establish yourself in a country that exists in the ""golden zone"" of having a highly educated population and low labor cost. This goes for any knowledge intensive industry. Countries are not in this sweet spot for long, as labor costs often start to raise quickly when they get there. Europe is not. China is leaving it. Other areas will attract these investments naturally.

If Europe wants to stake a claim in new industries that is not simply a variant of those they already dominate, industrial policy and directed investment is needed.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/lk3gx9/eu_weighs_deal_with_tsmc_samsung_for/gnis1av/,notbatmanyet,1613383208

Here, a few examples from LEFTIST (if we used centrists and right-wingers as well we could be here all day) politicians giving shit to the citizens of poorer regions:

What about that representative from ERC, Joan Puig, who called the people from Extremadura (poorest community in the country) ""ungrateful"" and ""bastards"" for not appreciating their Catalan overlords  enough?

What about that town councillor from the Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds (The Catalan environmentalism Greens), Llu√≠s Su√±√©, who published [this image also about Extremadura](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/MUb6IB6OPLZw6saCTsGaL5jnKyo=/768x0/arc-anglerfish-eu-central-1-prod-prisa.s3.amazonaws.com/public/POSXBWRH25ESRNRLTAO2TZKUWQ.jpg). Translation:

""SOS, Extremadura needs you! The 8'7% of the Catalan GPD is not enough, sponsor a child from Extremadura for 1000‚Ç¨/month""

Oh wow, child poverty, so funny amirite? It's hilarious to laugh at a region like Extremadura where the fucking 52% of the children live under the poverty line, hilarious!!!

What about Pere Aragon√®s, from ERC, talking about how the Catalana are genetically more European: ""the Catalana share more generics with the French than with the Spanish, more with the Italians than the Portuguese, and a little bit with the Swiss. The Spanish share more genetics with the Portuguese than with the Catalans, and very little genetics with the French. So curious...""

What about Joan Puigcerc√≥s when he was the president of Joan Puigcerc√≥s saying that the Catalans paid so much while no one from Andalusia pay taxes?

What about Rufi√°n, one of the most visible heads of ERC belittling a Twitter user, who told him mixing up Catalan and Spanish while talking didn't make sense, because he was from Seville/Andalusia? Rufi√°n literally tweeted a screenshot pointing at his location saying ""whatever."" That's it, he didn't even bother actually replying or ignoring him.

What about that time Dolors Bassa, from ERC, claiming that minors addicted to snorting glue were coming from Andalusia and Ceuta to Catalonia?

&gt;Communism (from Latin communis, 'common, universal') is a philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and **the absence of social classes, money and *the state*.**

It's in the definition that there isn't a state. 

So you can argue that communism isn't achievable or whatever but judging communism based on what happened in the Soviet Union, China or some other supposedly communist country is just idiotic.

1476,"The European Union is considering building an advanced semiconductor factory in Europe in an attempt to avoid relying on the U.S. and Asia for technology at the heart of some of its major industries.

The EU is exploring how to produce semiconductors with features smaller than 10 nanometers, and eventually down to 2 nanometer chips, according to people familiar with the project. The aim is to curtail dependence on countries such as Taiwan for chips to power 5G wireless systems, connected cars, high-performance computing, and more.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea, the two leaders making the most innovative processors in the sector, could be involved in the EU project, but nothing has been decided, a French Finance Ministry official said in a press briefing on Thursday, following the report from Bloomberg.

The plans come at a time when automakers are grappling with semiconductor shortages. Europe‚Äôs biggest carmaker, Volkswagen AG, lost tens of thousands of cars in production, and Daimler AG has said it‚Äôs doing everything it can to minimize effects of the industrywide supply bottleneck. While the problem may prove to be short-lived, the issue has highlighted Europe‚Äôs reliance on sourcing key technology from abroad.

European attempts to ramp up production -- led in part by European Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton -- could involve re-developing an existing foundry or building a new one, the people said, who added no final decision has been taken and the time frame of the project is still to be determined.

A European Commission spokesperson did not respond to requests to comment. Samsung didn‚Äôt immediately respond to an email for comments.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to fab location selection, we need to consider many factors including customers‚Äô need. TSMC does not rule out any possibility, but there is no concrete plan at this time,‚Äù spokeswoman Nina Kao said in an email when asked about cooperating with Europe.

Once a hub of semiconductor factories, Europe has dramatically cut back on manufacturing over the past 20 years, with automotive-chip designers including NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG preferring to outsource a major chunk of production to giants like TSMC, and other foundries. When carmakers wanted to increase orders at the end of 2020, they struggled to secure capacity, after demand had already been allocated to other industries such as smartphones.",London born.

The only thing our government would have to do is back those restrictions with data. And it is not like the government does not have the data that opening pubs and restaurants leads to the spread of disease.

Our government does not want to justify the restrictions because it is simpler for it to just close everything without having to explain why. Considering many people do not follow the measures because they don't understand them, it would actually be useful if the government had to explain them outside of SoE.

Also, political parties represented in our Chamber of Deputies have requested our government to e.g. increase the compensations for people and businesses, which would make more people follow the measures. Our government promised to do that but nothing happened. Thus, Chamber of Deputies decided that the only way to control the government is to take away its SoE. Would it be better if the Chamber removed the government itself? 

Note, that the Chamber also asked the government to enforce some other reasonable measures while removing some unsubstantiated ones. The government was asked to do that multiple times in exchange for SoE support, promised to do that every time and then always somehow forgot...

Also, the opposition already presented the government a Pandemic Law---something between the extreme State of Emergency and a normal state---but the government refused to do anything with it.

Automakers traditionally use relatively basic chips, but as cars made by Tesla Inc. and VW have become increasingly reliant on software, the demand for smaller semiconductors has increased. GlobalFoundries is Europe‚Äôs main foundry, which typically produces 28 nm processors at its Dresden factory for mainstream applications.

‚ÄúIn terms of geo-strategy and from a resilience perspective in the international system, it would make a lot of sense to have an advanced foundry‚Äù in Europe, said Mathieu Duchatel, who heads the Asia program at the Institut Montaigne, adding that while there may currently not yet be a need for 5 nm chips in Europe, decades in the future it could be of use, particularly in defense innovation.

One of the biggest hurdles for the EU‚Äôs semiconductor plans could come down to financing. At a conference last week, French Finance Minister Bruno LeMaire said Europe‚Äôs industrial projects, including on semiconductors, are all very investment intensive. ‚ÄúOne of the weak points is the access to risk capital in Europe and the implementation of the capital market in Europe,‚Äù he said.

Breton said last year the chip alliance would be armed with an initial combined public and private investment of as much as 30 billion euros, only slightly higher than TSMC‚Äôs annual capital expenditure this year. Around 19 member states have already backed the commission‚Äôs plans and have agreed to establish an investment instrument co-financed by the countries and participating companies. At least 20% of the EU‚Äôs 672.5 billion-euro recovery fund has also been allocated for digital priorities, including microelectronics.

1544,"Quite frankly because the politics of Spain overshadowed their potential to grow. To more clear, they were on the rise a few years ago when the main right wing party was plagued by corruption scandals and voters were coming to them. They tried to pass themselves as a central party, but in reality, most of their voter base was coming from that corrupt right wing party. So they started focusing all their energy towards becoming the lead right wing party. 

Keep in mind that they were born in Catalonia as a result of people discontent with the Spanish left-wing party embracing Catalanism(not independence, but taking on more of the cultural aspects much the same way the right-wing party has embraced Galicianism in Galicia). 

What ended up happening to derail C's is that that referendum happened. Then Vox began growing as a result of the referendum claiming themselves to be the ones who can really stop Catalonia by being super centralist. 

Instead of backing denying them, C's embraced them as a means of gaining power in Andalusia and Madrid. They also played second steps to them by organizing protest with them where they took photos with them. As it turns out, when you're competing to be the most right wing party, people are going to go for the hardcore version and not the version that wants to be centrist even though they were also using hard language just like Vox. 

The deathblow for C's probably came in the summer of 2020 after the April elections when they win an historic amount of seats in the elections. They could have pacted with PSOE to form a government that would have been stable and it's what PSOE wanted. Instead, it's leader decided he would placed a sanitation cord around PSOE playing to the tune of Vox who considered PSOE an anti-constitutionalist party. So what happened is that there had to be another election and they pretty much lost all of their seats. Now both Vox and the regular right-wing party are in a tug of war match while the current leader of C's is trying to be more centrist in policy and rhetoric, but barring a huge corruption scandal in PSOE or PP/Vox, there probably won't be another huge exodus of voters into another party. 

I think it's fair to say in conclusion that the current ills of C's have everything to do with the decisions of it's previous leader taken after the 2017 referendum.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/ljzfey/elections_in_catalonia_the_proindependence/gni6r7t/,Matrim_WoT,1613365489

&gt;""per capita consumption figures likely overstate actually available amounts, given that the Soviet Union‚Äôs inadequate transportation and storage infrastructure led to frequent shortages in stores, as well as significant loss of foodstuffs and raw products due to spoilage... In 1988, at the height of perestroika, it was revealed that Soviet authorities had been inflating meat consumption statistics; it moreover transpired that there existed considerable inequalities in meat consumption, with the intake of the poorest socioeconomic strata actually declining by over 30 percent since 1970... Government experts estimated that the elimination of waste and spoilage in the production, storage, and distribution of food could have increased the availability of grain by 25 percent, of fruits and vegetables by 40 percent, and of meat products by 15 percent.""

&gt;  
&gt;This means that there's no actual way of accurately knowing the USSR caloric intake, but there's a reason they were inflating numbers, weren't they?

* The caloric intake of modern Russians is lower than in Soviet times

Russia's current caloric intake as of right now is  3,320 kilocalories, the Soviets reached to around 3,400 kilocalories.

* Your own source is showing us that Soviet gdp growth was higher than the global capitalist average""

"" The USSR could be seen as a long-term bubble economy: Initial fast-growth, then stagnation, and finally crisis, in comparison to the rest of the economies, that took longer to take off,¬†but that growth was then sustained. ""

"" We can also take another year, like 1950, to avoid WWII effects, and use indexed data, but this doesn't change the picture much. That's why I included fewer¬†countries, to make my life easier. I also included the United States and Switzerland and Hong Kong. Hong Kong tells roughly the same story as Singapore: that you can be really poor and grow rich with adequate institutions and capitalism. The United States and Switzerland (Or any developed country) illustrate an effect that wasn't obvious from the previous charts: that it isn't fair to compare the rates of growth between these countries and the SU. Richer countries grow at a slower pace. ""

""Next, I consider the period 1928-1989 and 1928-1991. Allen stops at 1970 because until then 'the planning system was working well'. In my view, we should see what came after 1970 as a consequence of what came before, including perhaps the breakup and crash of the Soviet economy in 1991. Stopping our analysis when the planning system stopped working well seems to me like stopping an analysis of the Spanish economy just when the housing bubble was about to pop. By this I mean that Soviet growth was propelled in great measure by increasing inputs (capital and labour), not productivity, and that is not a stable long-term run strategy. At some point you run out of people to put to work. I refer to you to this [other post of mine](https://nintil.com/2016/11/07/the-soviet-union-productive-efficiency/) for more info on this. This is not an speculation of mine, it is the consensus view of why the USSR ended up stagnating (Though this by itself did not cause its collapse).

Now, the USSR is below South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Portugal, Finland, Singapore, Italy, Norway, and Thailand.

When extended to 1991, the USSR is also overtaken by Spain, Jamaica, and Singapore

I didn't really want to argue about not having to be wealthy to start a business (almost no people in the startup scene are rich around here) because you'll just ignore it or not believe it, but there's a different argument there: starting a coop business makes this argument irrelevant, because any financial needs in the start get split between x people.

Right. No argument from me here, the income disparity under communism was smaller because communists stole from people, that's what people around here are talking about from the very beginning.

Oxford University conducted the so-called Oxford trial in UK and Brazil, and we have data for patients who received the vaccine in one-month interval, 2 or 3 months interval. First of all, we believe that the efficacy of one dose is sufficient: 100 percent protection against severe disease and hospitalisation, and 71-73 percent of efficacy overall. The second dose is needed for long term protection. But you get a better efficiency if you get the 2nd dose later than earlier.

1910,"I definitely acted in good faith - if I could have written it more concisely I definitely would have. Much appreciated response, but to be honest facts are facts and I hope you can see why you or I being convinced isn't the issue. The issue is that the original post lacked historical context, which I badly provided. I can try and respond to you while distilling it one step further though.

The main aspect of the original post was ""islamophobia"" and how it affected modern day French Muslims. My response criticizes it for a lack of historical perspective. I just don't explicitly say that, but I think it was clear what was intended.

So islamophobia, like anything, is not caused by a single thing, that's easy for anyone to agree on. The original post is choosing to highlight the most recent period of french colonialism as the singular, or massively most important reason for modern day ""islamophobia"". I believe this is a mistake caused by an ignorance of history and emotional bias.

By contrast historians, or people who educated themselves outside of school, would see the entirety of french muslim relations as a whole regardless of how long it has been; this holistic view is very important because historians know that recent events find their causes in older events. So I pointed out how the recent colonialism by the French, occurred in response to centuries of a VERY REAL threat and fear that a bunch of muslim invaders were going to do to them what they already did to the italians and spanish. French colonialism was a short, hateful response to the devastating and painful muslim colonialism of europe and africa that lasted 600 years......do you get that connection? Recency bias is a big problem in a society that doesn't know history. French colonialism is by far less violent than the campaigns islam and europe waged against each other during the crusades, it honestly has very little to do with why islam and the french have tension. That is the bulk of my criticism.

Secondly, your argument about Napolean and the revolution and me disregarding 
other recent french history as reasons why the french identity exists is actually illogical. I don't disregard them at all, they just had nothing to do with what I was discussing and including them doesn't make logical sense. I gave you the exact moment in time when france became france and ceased being just a group of loosely associated barbarians from Germany. French identity is mostly related to the fact that the proto-french had to ally with each other to avoid slavery and genocide when the Ummayad Dynasty attacked Gaul - Napolean was not going to be alive for 700 more years....and has nothing to do with why the french became french.

Third, you bring up a lot of random things throughout your whole response that are not associated with the discussion. A couple were pretty wild assumptions about my education or world-view. FYI, I am well versed in most history involving the middle east and islam, despite what you disrespectfully assumed in your post. I am obviously also very aware of the general histories and violence in Europe, so you bringing these things up assuming I didn't know them without a real reason is just random to me.

Lastly, I have no clue why you bring race into this in the last paragraph. We have been discussing facts about history and religions this whole time...?

2011,"A - There is nothing socialist in having a good, livable minimum wage. Extreme unhinged capitalism made you believe that exploitation is the way forward.

B - There is a reason why living conditions are better in european countries with more socialists valyes than in USA : people are much happier and less stressed BECAUSE the governament is there to help them when they can't make ends meet. In USA, that's assured homelesness. We pay much more taxes because we can afford it in Europe, and ask any European, we would gladly pay more taxes if it ment keeping free health care out of reach of any corporate greed. No one in Europe or Canada ever EVER begged not to go to a hospital or take an ambulance because it would cripple them financially.  Socialized health care cost less per year than privitized health care, that is proven. And if a small business doesn t make enough money to pay every employee a decent wage, it means they shouldn't have employees in the first place. If they can't operata without employees, it means they shouldn t be in business until they can.

C - USA is a hellhole for any immigrant who doesn't have ample means on arrival, and USA still leads the board with illegal immigration. Social benefits do not cause illegal immigration, it only helps everyome to live decently no matter their means. Free health care, free education, and let's hope free public transportations are the way forward. Soon therenwill be no other solution and no way out of UBI, and this is the best thing that could happen : no one will ever be victim of greedy landlords, no one will ever be stressed because of bills and rent and mortgage. No one will ever be forced to work 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet. A person should be able to pay rent, bills and food without stress on A SINGLE MINIMUM SALARY, after taxes. $15 is a step in the right direction. $17 would be better.

2052,"&gt;Norway set a world record for electric cars last year. For the first time, more electric cars were sold there than vehicles with combustion engines. VW came out on top, with two e-cars from the Wolfsburg-based company among the top three in Norway. One of them even knocked Tesla out of first place.
From 2025, Norway will only permit e-cars
Norway wants to stop allowing new combustion engines in four years' time and has been promoting electromobility extensively for years. With success: Last year, 141,412 new cars were registered, of which 76,789 were pure electric cars, or 54.3 percent. Norway is thus the first country in the world to have more battery-electric cars newly registered than vehicles with gasoline, diesel or hybrid engines.
Audi e-tron and VW ID.3 in the top 3
The Audi e-tron took first place with 9,227 new registrations, displacing Tesla's Model 3 in second place with 7,770 vehicles. The VW ID.3 is in third place with 7,754 new cars sold, although VW has only been offering the model since September. The 76,789 pure electric cars were joined by 28,905 plug-in hybrids sold last year. Here, too, VW does well in Norway, with the e-Golf plug-in hybrid making it to 5th place.
If pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids are added together, Norway comes in at just under 75 percent of new registrations. E-car drivers can enjoy many advantages in the Scandinavian country. They pay no import duties or taxes on their vehicles, and there is no freeway toll. In cities, electric cars are allowed to use the bus lane and for the most part do not have to pay any fees in public parking lots.
Charging stations in Norway heavily utilized
Interestingly, in Norway the number of charging stations apparently has little to do with the success of e-cars. In Norway, there are 23 vehicles per charging station, compared with only 9 in Germany. The fact that there are fewer charging stations that are heavily used apparently does not deter Norwegian buyers from electric cars.
VW on the road to success
Incidentally, VW has been very successful with the ID.3 not only in Norway, but also in other countries such as Finland, Sweden and Slovenia. There, according to VW, it was the most frequently delivered battery electric vehicle in each case. In Sweden, it was even the best-selling car overall in December, regardless of the type of drive.

Capitalism, in its ""free market"" unregulated form, is truly a dystopian system. Under free market capitalism, those who cannot work and provide for themselves (because they are born with disabilities, grow too old, suffer debilitating injuries, etc) will suffer and die. Even workers who are productive are often exploited, not to mention the rampant waste and pollution caused by free market capitalism.

I see, you are talking about ""currency trading"" which is a form of trading where two currencies are traded against one another. Never ever heard someone refer to a currency traded in currency trading as ""a trading currency"" but let's put this misunderstanding aside.

My original question still stands: Why did you not mark NK as red? You can only answer this in two possible ways:

* a. ""I did not know that the euro is used in NK""
* b. ""There is a difference in the way the euro is used for payment in Zimbabwe and NK, this difference is that...""

We need better anti-mafia and anti-corruption laws, because what we're doing now is clearly still not enough. We need a bureaucracy overhaul because right now things are so bad companies are afraid to invest in the country because of this huge time and money sink. Lowering and reshuffling taxation would be cool too, because right now taxes are very high. Something also needs to be done to combat unemployment among the young, and school abandonment rates. Also, salaries are very low and I don't know how the government can even fix this, but any incentive to speed up the modernization of companies and employers in the country would probably go a long way. We also need more effort put into fighting tax evasion, which is a huge issue for everyone. I probably could go on, Italy has a huge series of problems (and I'm not even touching social ones, like how the hell are gay people not allowed to marry in 2021) and our governments are too busy discussing bullshit to begin addressing even one of the points in my list, and even fixing everything here would probably still not fix the situation at all, like our sky high public debt, no plans to ever reintroduce nuclear energy, super low levels of digital and computer competency, rampant racism and ignorance, etc

Basically, the country is such a clusterfuck that if you're in your 20s or 30s, your best bet is to find a better country to live in instead of waiting for your concerns to be addressed, because at the moment things are actually getting worse, not better, so I don't really see the point in waiting.. this is reflected by the huge emigration rate from the country, the educated flee while the average Joe is only afraid of some brown people at the border.",,/r/europe/comments/liopiw/new_italian_prime_minister_mario_draghi_the_man/gne13fs/,xevizero,1613303907

Compare a cured ham (""just"" a pig's leg in salt, most of the times completely uncooked), to a tenderloin medallion. Even wildly different things can be done with the same parts; spanish torreznos (pig belly cut in cubes and deep fried with salt sprinkled on top) vs bacon (also just pig belly, but this time sliced thinly and then cured in salt or brine, sometimes smoked, before it is then fried). If I didn't know, I dont think I'd guess.

Bacon is pretty basic pork. Maybe you just live in place where there is no high quality pig meat? If it is a plain cut you'll be able to distinguish things like the quality of the meat better. (In my opinion  but I dont think this is controversial?) Iberian pork tastes better in all its basic cuts, not just when it is processed to ham. I mean the difference between a shitty cafeter√≠a meal and a michelin star restaurant, for the same cut.

In addition, it has four studies published since the beginning of 2021, in preprints, all of which point in the same direction. Three of them were conducted in the United States and the fourth in Italy. Three followed cohorts of healthcare workers, the last one analysed a panel of blood samples taken at random. All focused their analysis on the messenger RNA vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the most widely deployed. And they all came to the same conclusion: one dose of vaccine injected into a former patient produces an immune response that is as strong, if not stronger, than two doses given to a person who is ""na√Øve"" to the virus.

And, look, in so far as that is a matter for the medical agencies of each member state I don't disagree. That's their call. The EMA have approved it for use. 

You're right in that it is all about risks..... but the other risk is balancing an aging population, restricted supply of vaccines in general, rapid deaths, and lack of economic activity due to extended lockdowns. Maybe that's not a risk worth taking given you _do_ have a vaccine that prevents severe illness and death.

I think you're confused.

The part re: ""appropriateness"" is nonsense and you'll pardon me if I don't engage with it.

&gt; Or deleting UK posts on vaccines but not EU ones even when they were directly reported to you?

2520,"no, your understanding of communism is extremely flawed. you are looking at it through the lens of what we've seen so far in ""communist countries"" which are little more than state capitalists with a tiny bit of worker ownership. every time a socialist/communist nation pops up what do you think the incredibly powerful and rich western capitalist countries do? trade embargoes, stopping other countries from trading with them, stopping buying their goods, and if the country is small enough, invading and replacing the (elected by the people) leader of the country. this is the reason why the only communist/socialist nations are those strong enough to withstand the imperialist forces of the west, such as Russia and China (again tho, not communist). please have a look at all of the trade bans and coups that have occurred in central/southern America that were propagated by the US and EU. then capitalist dipshits like you point out these ""starving and failed countries"" which always happen either due to incompetent leaders (Russia) or Western involvement and complete ceasing of trade. and then, these western forces sweep in, perform a coup, and install a right wing dictator who will do their bidding, drain the countries natural resources and sell it to them at incredibly low prices to help ONLY the capitalist class of those western countries. just look up what happens to these weaker nations who don't have the manpower to defend themselves, and then tell me that it's entirely their fault. (also unethical imprisonment what the fuck are you talking about have you fucking seen the United States, highest prison pop. in the world, highest % in prison, worst systemic racism especially in the prison system. and again these prisons are very often used to profit off of their inmates, since they're already in a controlled economy. shut up.)

no matter how many fancy ways you describe capitalism, the only way it can thrive is through exploitation of:


1) its own workers. 


-capitalists use the labour that their workers generate and take a cut (generally the vast majority), meaning that the worker doesn't receive the full value of their labour


2) other poorer nations


-the same principle but applied on a larger scale, due to free market forces demand is so high that the pressure and toll on the countries resources had to be exported to others, who will make a fraction of the profits that the ruling classes in the capitalists nations do


whoops, maybe that genuine argument with actual points was a little too complex for your brain which has shrivelled up altogether from complete capitalist indoctrination. how about this:


capitalism is just fascism painted white: you can pretend that they are hugely different, but at the end of the day there will still be an incredibly powerful capitalist authoritarian class making all the decisions by leveraging the power of their capital. whoops, made an actual point again.

2749,"&gt;You can't write a contract to do that as it would be illegal.

So if it were legal, it would be ok? wtf?

&gt;Contracts only hold if the entity enforcing them can actually enforce them. In democracies, usually people can vote on issues without having to resort to military force.

This is perhaps the fundamental flaw in your worldview. You're operating off of the idea that we live in a functioning democracy. And no, I'm not about to talk about corruption, as bad it is under capitalism due to wealth inequality. I'm talking about [manufacturing consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent). The media, advertising, colleges, research institutions, every major source of information barring a couple of government programs (which are often contributed to/bribed by wealthy capitalists), are controlled by capitalists. Even ""left"" leaning sources are always pro-capitalism, even if they advocate higher wages or something, it's usually because the capitalists who fund that source would benefit from it (i.e. tech companies who get all their labor from impoverished companies and benefit from wealthy consumers). 

Socialism is in the material interests of the working class. The reason so many don't recognize as much is the same reason such a large portion of China genuinely thinks the CCP is communist, despite China having billionaires who own private property. Propaganda. Advertising is a trillion dollar industry. Most of that money is spent by giant already well established companies. The reason they advertise isn't to inform you, it's to influence you, subconsciously. Most people can recognize that. But the same goes for the rest of the media they fund. There's a reason there are so many gigantic right-wing influencers, like Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Candice Owens, ect. but so few truly leftist ones. The few who do call themselves leftist are always still some flavor of capitalist, at most being social democrats who call themselves democratic socialists. The largest modern left wing influencers I know are YouTubers who grew their channels entirely themselves, without millions to spend on advertising. Which perhaps explains why they all have shitty production quality, now that I think about it...

If you want to read more about manufacturing consent, read the book by Herman and Chomsky. Or, at listen to Chomsky talk about it.

&gt;Giving the government the right to confiscate any private property has historically, every time, led to authoritarianism.

Socialists don't advocate giving the government the right to confiscate private property... They advocate for all private property to be public property, and to be controlled democratically. Generally, 
power over such property would likely be devolved to those who use the property or locals. Depends on what the people want.

Also, while private land ownership seems less relevant today, it is still the fundamental basis of capitalism, because land is needed for literally all production. You can't make things of material value without land. 

And while I did switch between talking about private property in general and land several times, I didn't conflate them. If people think of ideas and choose to share them, other people should be able to take full advantage of those ideas. The idea that Disney should be able to prevent people from making a Micky Mouse film because they own the copyright is absurd. But there's not much purpose for copyrights/patents/trademarks once wealth accumulation is eliminated along side private property. It's really just a way to restrict competition, from the standpoint of corporations like Disney, or insulin producers, of which there are 3 that account for 90% of global production, due to patents.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/liwovo/memorial_of_the_victims_of_communism_in_prague/gncrzqf/,TheGoldenChampion,1613278787

This requires the workers to seize the company. Despite what other communists will tell, this won't just 'happen', a government with huge power will have to seize companies on behalf of the people and carry out the peoples will through democracy.

You mean the same way you strawmanned communism?

&gt;You assume that since I argued against communism that I love capitalism. I think capitalism and communism are equally shitty systems.

Okay, capitalism is shit, I'll take your word for it. Since you reject communism, what alternative mode of production would you suggest?

&gt;The closest ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù country to try something actually good was Yugoslavia with its market socialist economy

Yugoslavia was good for many reasons, the market economy not being one of them. In fact it's one of the reasons it was destroyed.

&gt;But yes, when I studied Russian in college, I knew many people who lived in the eastern bloc and they thought it sucked.

Sweet, I live in an actual ex-socialist country and I know many people who would kill to go back to the time where they could **live** like people. But anecdotal evidence isn't evidence at all, I have relevant statistics to prove my point.

2905,"&gt; The article does not comment on what the ratio of empty lorries was so far in February

I am not sure what you mean. I have quoted the relevant sections of the article providing information on exactly that. 

&gt; It's not disingenuous, it's an aside. 

You claimed ""There is absolutely no data on whether there are still 'above-normal' levels of empty lorries returning to the EU over that period."" The article presents figures relating exactly to that point. You then proceed to try to justify your statements via confusing absolute counts with percentages (the absolute number is completely irrelevant when the statistics are expressed in percentages) and implying that a large percentage of the total number of lorries was being turned back, which is not the case at all. 

&gt; Do you think empty trucks were turned around for not having the correct forms?

It is my understanding that, in order to enter the queues in Kent, you need the correct paperwork to be able to travel, you can't just say ""trust me guv, there's nothing in the back, honest"" and be let through. 

&gt; the empty lorries 'data' you quote next is almost certainly from January, they aren't for comparable periods, which is what you are assuming.

Great. Glad we agree that the article is very badly presenting information in a misleading way. Also, please don't say ""'data' you quote"" like that because a) the 'data' is in the article that you're claiming does not require a misleading tag, and b) ""I"" am not quoting it out of the blue or some other source, it's in the piece we're discussing. 

&gt; I'm accusing the r/Europe moderators off systemic bias against 'Brexit positive' (for lack of a better word) threads

In my opinion, that's nonsense, and a groundless accusation. 

&gt; shamefully censoring discussion over the Commission's monumental vaccine PR disaster by megathreading the issue, even as new information was coming out

I guess that we can all exhibit selective memory and pretend to ignore the fact that creation of the megathread was a response to the clear and obvious brigading that went on. 

&gt; I can find hundreds of posts that were not labelled as misleading, despite being far more flexible with the truth than this one.

Well, in the future, I would suggest that rather than keeping that information to yourself, you might want to bring it to the attention of the moderation team via modmail. 

&gt; I'm well within my right to point out that there is some evidence of a double standard.

You're certainly entitled to your opinion on the matter, sure. I am afraid that mine differs. 

&gt; Genuinely though, with the acrimony of the Brexit negotiations behind us we might see this sub return to a more civil and respectful form of discourse, if anything it has gotten worse, and it's particularly concerning that the mods seem to getting even more directly involved in the problem.

The moderation team goes out of their way to remain as unbiased as possible. We can't please everyone all the time, and believe me when I say that we do agonize over these types of discussions. The problem here is that this particular article is well below the standard one would expect from Faisal Islam and the BBC - that people see it as ""pro-Brexit"" is evidence of how deteriorated the discourse has become on that particular subject.",P√• lang slik er alt midlertidig,/r/europe/comments/lizh8z/brexit_lorry_chaos_avoided_as_freight_flows_back/gnbk494/,KvalitetstidEnsam,1613260614

I live in Denmark, we have a welfare state and I love that, but, we still need the exploitation of workers (not necessarily workers that work in Denmark, it could be the worker in a Chinese, Vietnamese or any other countries factory).

 The reason as to why I think capitalism is immoral can be said like this: if you want to become a wealthy capitalist you have to cut your worker salaries and give yourself that so you gain more profit basically stealing the labour value of the worker and giving the money they should have received for their amount of labour to yourself.

Also, your argument fails in it's premise: The assumption that Socialism and Communism mean State Control.  
But that couldn't be further from the truth, as the seizing of the means of production would be the last independent act of the State, after which it would wither away and would be needed less and less in managing daily affairs.  
Also, I would dispute that Private Property grants great personal freedom and democracy. While that is true for the small minority that owns said property (As capitalism would have it naturally narrowed down to), their position as owners (which is reinforced by things you mentioned like the State) allows them to deprive access of said property and it's produce (such as food, clothes, etc.) to the propertyless, and leave them with nothing to sell but their labour, creating a coercive relationship between the owner and the worker.

This lack of distinction is usually how sentiments like these are sold in the 'enlightened' West, whereby deaths happening under Communist rule are deaths attributed directly to Communist ideology whereas, say, 3 million\~ dead Indians under colonial rule is (at best tentatively) attributed to an individual country.

If we treated deaths attributed to Western nations the same way we did above, we'd have numerous statues titled *victims of Liberal Democracy*.

3201,"From a purely ideological standpoint the government isn't involved with communism. Unfortunately we don't live in an ideological society. In practice and in theory are different things as many engineers and machinists can tell you. 

A capitalist system requires enforcement by it's nature and therefore government. Enforcement to protect assets, enforcement to protect rules, Entities will gravitate to protecting them by themselves. This breaks down by populist revolt therefore government where the the people feel some measure of control is founded. Government is intrinsically linked to capitalism in this way. Government in a capitalistic system (there are many ways to do capitalism) is structured in such as way to give advantage those who participate in the system. Government therefore cannot be separated from the system it is a part of.

Decisions of government are thusly influenced by the underlying system and it's goals.

Capitalism does not require the creation of a powerful state to control and run the free market - it actively discourages it principle. Most forms of authoritarian capitalism directly go against the ideas of the open market. Communism requires the creation of a large and powerful state that holds accountability and controls distribution.

Romania was, before ww2, lead by a fascist regime that was the more radical version on nazi germany, after that the commies (with the help of the ussr) won 70% in the elections (with only 500 members all over the country, 100% fair elections, not stolen at all) and instantly arrested their opponents, made every single opposition party illegal and started a nightmare for Romania that would last till abt 1970.

In the 70's Romania did good (not great, good) bcos the leader (that was a dumb illiterate fuck) talked shit to the ussr and the USA saw it as a perfect opportunity to step on ussr's pride and got into good relations with Romania.

In the 80's we did shit, terrible, the dumbfuck decided to pay all the external debt and how he decided to do it? Starve the population, reduce their acces to electricity (that was already limited) and force ppl to work more (sometimes you wouldn't have even the sunday as a free day).

And finally, on 25th December 1989, Romania got the best Christmas present of all time, The Execution of the ceausescu couple, the leader and his bitch, those god damned traitors were killed after they tried to run from the country.

And we tought that after that we would be better, but guess what, ex commies, to this day, are still in position of power. Unfortunately Romanian ppl recognized their good and patriotic politicians only after their death (Corneliu Coposu, known as a dignity symbol, Corneliu Tudor Vadim, the man was an actual genius, etc)

Marx came up with the idea of a modern command economy, which to many people is a terribly unpopular format that is notoriously bad at catering to what the consumers need. In order to have a command economy, the state needs to have total control over everything - meaning a communist state needs to be, in some way, a dictatorship. As we well know, this power tends to get to people‚Äôs heads. So while indeed, the economic standpoint of ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù didn‚Äôt kill all those people, the prerequisites of a communist nation did. So it could be argued that they died *because* of the very nature of communism.

And about your statement on the Holocaust - the Nazis weren‚Äôt really capitalists either. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not using the ‚Äúthey had socialists in the name, they must have been left wing!!!‚Äù. What I mean is that, they too had a command economy, which is about as anti capitalist as you can get without abolishing the economy entirely.

3324,"Oof this comment section. Communism is a mixed bag, you are not a bad person for being a communist you are probably just naive.

The main problem with the ideology is it requires conformism. You have to make people conform/participate in the ideology for it to be successful, which is why they all devolve into brutal dictatorships. To redistribute the goods among the people a strong authoritarian state is needed, which will turn into a dictatorship. If you don't believe watch Big tech is the next few years, they have a lot of power that is unchecked currently. 

Capitalism doesn't need that as it separates state from market. Goods are handled not just by the government but redistributed among the people themselves in exchange for services, other goods etc. Sure it certainly has its problems but it's our best system for now. The main problem with Reddit and the political rift right now is both sides see the other as the extreme.

3379,"We attribute the death of large numbers of people to political ideologies, not economic systems. That's why you blame the Nazis for the holocaust. Communism is a political ideology created 200 years ago without any base in (and largely in contrast to) Western society. Only a small part of the communist ideology is economic policy, while the opposite is true for capitalism. 


Because communism contrasts western systems by design, it's easy to compare communism and capitalism, but we forget only the former is a political ideology. And as a direct result of the implementation of the core tenets of that ideology, around a hundred million people have been killed over the past hundred years. 


Notice that when you want to blame capitalism for an atrocity, you can always blame something else as well, i.e.: colonialism, imperialism, corporatism, nazism, fascism, etc. And these ideologies stake a much better claim to blame because they divide people into substrata based on one or multiple group identities, which makes it easy for 'bad people' to exploit and persecute those groups as a whole. On the other hand, it's hard to see the role that capitalism plays in this system because it's obfuscated by the aforementioned political ideologies.

3496,"the problem is that when you are trying to tell you about the Soviet ""communism""you're using completely the wrong narativ.

The main thing about the Stalinist repressions and the Gulag is that due to Stalin's personal paranoia and the special political conditions in the interwar period, the overgrown law-enforcement apparatus was transformed into the apparatus of terror. And anyone could have been hit by it.

But when the Stalinist regime ended, the Gulag and mass executions suddenly disappeared. But for some reason, in the West, they forget about this second half of the existence of the USSR.

And outspoken and bright dissidents were persecuted. They were fired from a ""delicious"" job, where it was possible not to work, but to fight the regime. And with active ani-state activity, they were put in prison. And just kicked out of the country.

But only a particularly biased person would argue that this was fundamentally different from the situation of the fighters against the regime in the United States or the same Germany. Harassment, bans on professions, fabricated criminal cases and murders.  


P.S. The Nazis killed more than 25 million Soviet people. More than half of them are civilians.

Their next problem is that the carriers aren't even in range by the time of that first strike. The result is they're dead. 

The carrier's ability to operate behind visual range and beyond the range of a ship's radar is a huge advantage. In a wartime environment it has planes scouting out hundreds of miles away from the carrier, using their own powerful radars beaming down at the sea and transmitting real time data back to the fleet. Naval warfare is just way more complex than launching a bunch of ASHM's and calling it a day.

Yes... TECNICALLY you are true... but it's common knowlege that ignorant people are more religius, while instructed are less religius. That's the reason for the dark age of science, where the Christianity tried to block the diffusion of scientifical discovery that would make the religiun wrong.

Science is the comprehention of the law of Nature with proof and discussion, religion want to explain them by imvented story (example: the Genesy)

&gt;The creation of the universe doesn't contradict Abrahamic religions.

The creation of universe dont contadict because it's still not clear, but the creation of living being contradict the Abrahamic religion.

Eventually realize that a speculation inside your head isn't a proof that this is actually a fact.

BTW, there was also no one mentioning Asia. And if you think a German will have fear from seeing skyscapers of Russia ... you're misguided. Google for ""Skyline Frankfurt"" to see some skyscrapers there as well. Or look [here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Hochh%C3%A4user_in_Frankfurt_am_Main).

Also, somehow, we Germans don't put Russia completely into the Asian basket (we also don't put it completely into the European basket). Moskwa, for example, isn't even in Asia. We didn't look at Tyumen after all. So why do you bring up Asia?

Speaking about economic fear: the economy of Russia is just as large as the economy of Italy, so why would we need to compare it with asian countries like China?

China has a MUCH higher population than Europe and also much more landmass. And therefore MUCH higher potential for a MUCH bigger economy than Europe. Currently the BSP of europe is about 2x as large as China, but this will surely change.

Do you have fear about this, so that you transport your own feeling onto me or other europeans?

But if you want to put Russia into the same basket as China: be my guest. China has an even worse government and political system as Russia.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/lin8gq/moscow_russia/gn73y3w/,holgerschurig,1613218203

https://www.reuters.com/article/poland-gas-russia-idUSL5N25X1LG

&gt;If Germany gets better prices from Russia than Poland (and this isn't that unlikely!), then it might be because of the different energy mixes of these countries. Poland just doesn't use much gas, they are totally into coal: their energy mix is using about 50% coal as input.
&gt;So when it comes to import-negotiations, they probably get a better price for coal than Germany, which hardly uses coal anymore.

3765,"I largely agree, but I don't think we'll see a voluntary withdrawal from NATO from the countries that won't spend 2%. Those are likely to be the larger, more western members. If they left, NATO to the US would keep the liability the eastern countries pose while losing the asset the western countries provide.

&gt;Ischinger said Germany and the European Union more broadly needed to take seriously their role in the world. Faster, competent decision-making at the EU level, better military readiness and commitment to NATO's nuclear sharing policy are some of the big points he said would help convince American voters that the trans-Atlantic relationship remained in their interest.

This is unlikely to happen in a meaningful way. Europeans are not in favor of making any substantial political moves in the US's favor as it relates to Russia and China (how many times have we seen on this sub the polls showing a desire to remain neutral in issues between US and China/Russia), and as I'll note below, Europe's economic interests are not sufficiently aligned with the US.

&gt;""First, Biden will be welcomed,"" former US Acting Ambassador to Germany James Bindenagel told DW, albeit cautioning that some in Germany would want to see considerable changes. ""If the policies on China and Russia, for example, are the same with only a change in 'tone,' then the German narrative that America is not a reliable partner will be strengthened.""

Wanting the US to change its policies on Russia and China is wishful thinking. US interests are containing China to defend its own hegemony, its Pacific allies, and its economy. US interests on Russia could change, as noted below, but that would be to the detriment of Europe's security footing.

**For me, these are the key facts in evaluating the transatlantic relationship:**

-Only two things really matter: trade and security

-China's economy will surpass the US economy at some point in the 21st century

-The US will not have the same clear victory over China like it did over the USSR

-Europe will not jeopardize its trade with China to defend US hegemony

-In the absence of US unipolarity, the US's interests are far more narrow than many imagine

-Europe has no replacement for the US from a security perspective

Much discussion on this topic fails to consider: What are America's vital interests? If multipolarity is an inevitability, which allies and how much power projection does the United States actually need? What is the interest the US has in the Middle East when the US is effectively energy independent? With the Cold War over and Russia substantially weakened, how vital are the Europeans from a defense perspective? They won't side with the US against China meaningfully on trade, so their value is... what? Russia could make it to the Rhine and they wouldn't be any closer realistically to being able to project power across the Atlantic against the US.

The three things vital to the US this century are: (1)maintaining hegemony over its neighborhood (Americas), (2) preventing Chinese hegemony over the Pacific (for which it needs Japan, Australia, and India) and (3) access to international trade (with trade being supported by the major players in the multipolar world, the US doesn't have to do much heavy lifting). Beyond that, it needs only domestic stability and investment.

This to me paints a worrisome picture for Europe. Europe, with its ties to China's economy, is not a vital interest of the United States. Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, North Africa -- all of these are problems for Europe that it lacks the strength and cohesion to tackle alone, and the US will likely be increasingly disinterested in helping because of the above. America's unipolarity will likely fall to multipolarity, but Washington is in a good position to defend its VITAL interests this century. 

Brussels and Berlin are not. Europe that is effectively neutral on the matters of most concern to the United States isn't all that useful, so as Ischinger fears, it will be increasingly difficult for Europe to demonstrate a value high enough to justify the current NATO Art. 5 guarantee. Europe needs to step up and increase its own cohesion and capabilities, because whether Trump or Biden is in office, the transatlantic divide will likely only increase over time, and Europe needs to be better prepared, as the US likely already is.

3784,"BERLIN‚ÄîGermans with foreign roots are increasingly voting for the center-right, providing a new pool of voters for the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the country‚Äôs social fabric becomes increasingly diverse and traditional political allegiances dissolve with integration.

This could have significant political implications for the country, which was home to the largest group of migrants in the world‚Äî13 million‚Äîin 2019, just behind the U.S., according to the United Nations. It also shows how decades of immigration into Europe has transformed the continent‚Äôs demographics and is reshaping politics in unexpected ways.

The finding, in a new study by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a think tank linked to Ms. Merkel‚Äôs Christian Democratic Union shows a majority of people of migrant origin in the country favor conservative, free-market or even far-right parties.

‚ÄúWe are seeing a process of normalization,‚Äù said Viola Neu, the author of the study. As migrants become economically and culturally more integrated, get naturalized and gain the right to vote, they tend to shift support from the center-left to the center-right, she said.

‚ÄúPeople with immigrant backgrounds now vote like the majority does‚Äînot as a group tied to their origin, but according to their values and personal preferences,‚Äù she added.

Timur Husein, a Muslim politician who heads Ms. Merkel‚Äôs center-right party in the traditionally left-wing Berlin district of Kreuzberg, is one of a number of new faces in a party that still has ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù in its name but is becoming more open to non-Christian members and activists.

Mr. Husein has recently battled an initiative by local liberals to rename streets dedicated to Prussian generals who fought against Napoleon as part of an effort to remove references to wars and nationalism from public spaces. Just a few years ago, the coalition of Greens, Communists and Social Democrats backing the campaign could have counted on the support of people like Mr. Husein, born to Macedonian-Turkish and Croatian parents.

This is no longer true. In Germany, 53% of Turkish-origin voters said they would support conservative parties in 2019, up sharply from 17% in 2015 and closer to the parties‚Äô popularity among the broader electorate.

This has mainly been a boon for the CDU, which remains the country‚Äôs most popular party despite a steady erosion in support over the past two decades. The study also shows rising migrant support for the Greens, which has long shed its radical origins to become the second-largest centrist party in the country. Both parties broadly favor the welfare state and free markets, but the CDU has maintained a more socially conservative profile.

There is no statistical data, however, on the political leanings of recent arrivals such as Syrian refugees, very few of whom have obtained German citizenship and are able to vote.

Mr. Husein said his father, who worked in a factory, joined a union with ties to the center-left Social Democrats before joining the party itself. His mother supports the Left, a far-left group.

The couple worked hard to get him into a school that prepares academically gifted children for university. There, Mr. Husein had his first brush with progressive militantism, when fellow students burn their grade certificates in protest against imperialism and state oppression. ‚ÄúWe migrant children who struggled to even get there were mystified by that behavior‚Äîto us education was the way out of poverty,‚Äù he said.

When he joined the CDU in 1998 there were three members with immigrant roots in his district. Now migrants and their children make up a third of party members there. The group celebrates both Christmas and Iftar, the nightly breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan.

People of foreign background are natural conservative voters, said Serap G√ºler, a conservative politician. Most of Germany‚Äôs immigrant¬†communities hail from Turkey, the Balkans, the former Soviet Union and North Africa‚Äîcommunities that are comparatively¬†conservative in their values, often because they are religious.¬†Many of these immigrants, Ms. G√ºler said, reject favorite progressive issues such as drug legalization, criminal-justice reform and nontraditional family models.

Yet the CDU was until recently suspicious of migrants, she said. Helmut Kohl, the chancellor who presided over German reunification, wanted to deport half of the country‚Äôs Turkish population in the 1980s because he believed they couldn‚Äôt assimilate.

There are still occasional tensions at the grass-roots level. Sener Sahin, a Muslim, abandoned a bid to run for mayor of his Bavarian hometown early last year after meeting opposition from fellow conservatives. But party leaders have generally encouraged efforts to woo more diverse candidates.

When she joined the CDU in 2009, Ms. G√ºler was a rarity as a Turkish woman and immigrant. Now she no longer stands out, said Ms. G√ºler, a junior minister in the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany‚Äôs most populous state.

‚ÄúMigrant entrepreneurs, like the majority of entrepreneurs, want low taxes, while working people want to go up the social ladder and have less time for identity politics or progressive themes,‚Äù Ms. G√ºler said. The next milestone would be for the CDU to appoint the first-ever federal government minister with a migrant background, something that could happen after the next general election in September, she said.

In federal politics, one of the most prominent people of immigrant background is the spokesman for the conservative bloc in parliament, B√ºlend √úr√ºk, who was born in Turkey.

Srita Heide, an entrepreneur and CDU legislator in a district near Frankfurt, came to Germany from what was then Calcutta‚Äînow Kolkata‚Äîover 24 years ago and has since built a consulting firm operating across the globe. She was wooed by center-left parties but opted for the conservatives because, she says, she wasn‚Äôt driven by her identity as a migrant but by her values and political beliefs.

‚ÄúI believe in tradition and at the same time in being modern and going along with the times,‚Äù Ms. Heide said.

Immigrants have previously sided with progressive parties not for ideological reasons but because they hoped for more support and protection, said Haci-Halil Uslucan, professor of modern Turkish studies at the University of Duisburg-Essen.

Now, that pattern is breaking down because immigrants are becoming better integrated, Prof. Uslucan said. Meanwhile, conservatives are reaching out to migrant communities, which are often younger than the general population and therefore attractive to parties with an aging membership, he said.

In a recent essay titled ‚ÄúThe CDU Is the People‚Äôs Party of a Diverse Nation,‚Äù Health Minister Jens Spahn, a prominent CDU leader, and D√ºzen Tekkal, [an award-winning filmmaker of Yazidi origin](https://www.wsj.com/articles/immigrants-with-their-split-identities-trigger-soul-searching-in-germany-1534334402?mod=article_inline), call for a ‚Äúcosmopolitan patriotism‚Äù embracing all of Germany‚Äôs ethnic groups.

‚ÄúMany young people with a migrant background come to me and ask how they can get engaged politically without going to the left or the green parties,‚Äù said Ms. Tekkal, who runs a pro-integration group called German Dream. ‚ÄúThere is a process of transformation happening.‚Äù

Ms. Tekkal says that the conservatives must compete with the Greens for the future votes of new immigrants.

Tareq Alaows, a Green party politician who fled to Germany from war-ravaged Syria in 2015, is the first Syrian refugee to run for Parliament. He says the Greens became his political home because they stand for diversity, open society and climate action.

‚ÄúWith Germany‚Äôs restrictive asylum laws and refugees drowning in the Mediterranean, I think the conservatives in government take pride in small gestures, but they are not aligned with their Christian values,‚Äù Mr. Alaows said.

Joe Chialo, the CDU parliamentary candidate from Berlin‚Äôs Mitte district, a Green party stronghold, disagrees. Mr. Chialo, a practicing Christian, entrepreneur and executive at Universal Music Group who hails from Tanzania, was once a member of the Greens and shifted to the CDU five years ago.

‚ÄúI left the Greens because moralizing became more important \[to them\] than political action,‚Äù Mr. Chialo said. ‚ÄúAs an entrepreneur, as a family man and as a man of faith I feel the CDU represents my values now.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/liwi6h/immigrants_and_their_children_shift_toward/gn5sdd3/,j12329lk2,1613204141

The indigenous peoples fought back, so the French tried to starve them all to death and many resorted to eating their children. By the 1300s the economy was less than 0.01% of global GDP.

The middle ground is to settle for a mix of the two, or a medium sized one that isn't too small to not be able to carry big guns, but it's also not too big to be able to be more flexible. 

Isn't this how tanks evolved too? Before WW2 you have this big dilemma between heavy tanks and light tanks, and the same problem arose.

like i said, i wouldn't take the stance that the EU is racist. but still has race as an issue to tackle deeply. all these study's are a bit flippent in my eyes. its a hard thing to quantify. but, i have linked the source material that is digested by uk citizens, and the normal starting point for anyone who wants to accuse the EU of being racist   


now, racism is still an issue in the UK. i dont think any country can remove it completely. the uk, in some aspects (but not all, Muslims and Islam is a hot topic here as well, and definitely needs improvement) **may** have reached the highest realistic point of tolerance. i think, it would be good to see every country hit the 90%+ on all the questions in the studys.   


how you tackle it? not sure. positive image from your leaders, with a generational shift is probably the only way to get there.

4061,"I have a one-of-a-kind story about that. 

Back in automn 2003 i think, studying in North of France near Lille. Once with my friend we leave Lille with his big old car aiming at reaching Besan√ßon in the East of France. My Friend - the driver - wants to take a diversion through Belgium and Luxembourg and then go south through Alsace, to avoid the pretty high fees of the french highways, so we are in for a 6-7 hours drive. 

We leave Lille in the early night, enter Belgium, go on for may be 200 kms until the fuel reserve indicator light comes on. My friend, self-confident, tells me ""yeah dont worry the reserve can last 80 kms we'll manage to find a gas station in the mean time""...

About 20 kms more, we find one, park the car, but we have to rely on the automatic stations because it's too late for any human presence. Problem is we dont know any of the displayed credit cards allowed, and especially mastercard/visa is not one of them !

About 20kms more, other station, same failure !  It's about 10 pm, pressure starts to rise...

About 20 kms more  (or was it 30 ?), we manage to get out of the highway and find a gas station in a small city ... but still the same problem, no mastercard accepted ! Now we start to worry a little about what's left in the fuel tank, and even more where  on hell to go to find some fuel at this late hour, especially that in those days we didnt have any smartphone or GPS. 

So we rely on the panels for directions and miraculously find the direction of a comercial area just outside of the city... Time to pray to be able to reach it in time! 1..2..3 kms, commercial area in sight ! Now we have to find a gas station ahah.. it's dark we can't see well so we pick the first way we see andengage the car in the commercial area... Bam!  At this precise moment the car is running on empty and stops lamentably. 

It's now more than 11pm, we dont know where we are... but.. we have some water bottles in the car trunk and our last chance is to empty them and to fill them with fuel whenever we find a damn gas station. Although we are on the side of a fast car lane we can see some kind of village alongside of the road so we decide to try our luck and knock at a house to ask for at best a drive at least directions to the closest gas station. I le t you imagine the face of the guy opening the door this late to 2 guys with 2 emtpy plastic bottles each...  Scared like a deer in front of a car in a forest, he doesnt offer us a drive but tells us that there is another gas station 5kms away. 

So here we are, walking on the side of a an expressway and hitchhiking. A car stops , the music is loud , it stinks wine, this is a french guy .. searching for his mate who is supposed to be nearby in some kind of hostess bar for truck drivers mouhaha. This guy is a bit crazy but he leads us to the Holy Grail, the gas station, and leave immediately. 

Of course it would have been too easy if it ended now : our mastercard is still not allowed and we are fucked. I'm starting to get on my nerves and feel tired , knowing that we just drove one third of th distance to Besancon. 

Now comes the real delirium.  We noticed a round about just prior to the gast staion so we stand there and waves to car drivers  with our empy bottles to sgnify them that we are in need of help for fuel.  A few cars slow down and when they see those two monkeys reaccelerate, i don't blame them for that . 

Its almost 1 am, and we dont laugh anymore... when suddenly a van slows down....  Its the police ! Never been happier in my life to see the police coming ! We explain our situation and just see these folks laughing, saying ""ahh you were amost there, Luxebourg is 3 kms away ! and actually you are lucky to be safe because this commercial area was the golden triangle at the border of Belgium, Fance and Luxembourg for trafficking drugs and weapons !"" 

So here we are a the back of a police van, with our empty bottles crossing the border to Luxembourg, finding a gas-station that accept all the credit/debits cards of the world and beyond, and filling the bottles at the light of the police van !

They bring us back to the car, we add our few liters of fuel to the the tank, and the car is born again.... Merci la police belge (ou luxembourgeoise)  !

We are three hours late, and finally heading again to Besan√ßon. Well, that was true until the second crazy event of the  night a few hours later (a story about fog and road infrastructures) !

4081,"Since i'm %12.5 Kurdish, you're asking this to a right guy :)

We generally don't have problems with Kurdish people. We fought together. We build this country together. 

But at first years of the republic, we had some major ptsd from treaty of Sevr. During the Ottoman times, we lost literally every place that has any differentiality. Even Arabian peninsula rebeled and it caused shock. So they though that, if there won't be any differences, we wouldn't split. Until 80's, oppression wasn't severe (no one even realized that there was at the first place) because Kurds were mainly living at rural and sadly undeveloped areas. There were generally farmer and those places had feudal type rich a.sholes. (there were rich guys who called aƒüa, they had everything. And everybody worked for them. And those people only gained the amount that their aƒüa's though suitable. Terrible as you can imagine). At the coup 80, Kenan Evren banned Kurdish language and even Kurdish names. (he wasn't racist tho. He was psychopath in general. His solution of ending leftist and rightist brawls was hanging both sides. And those people that he hanged was university students). 

Kurdish language ban lifted at '91 and Kurdish names are legal since early '00 (I don't even know why did they banned them. How can anyone control if someone speaking something lmao) 

After the foundation of PKK, until 00's, wasn't exactly a nice times to remember. Being Kurdish still wasn't a reason to get bullied (because there were Kurdish people at every socio-economic places, even at the parliament since the beginning) but words like 'Kurd', 'Kurdish' became a taboo because it was reminding PKK (they weren't as harmless as today tho. Starting from the 80's to the late 00's they terrorized the whole country. And ironicly they killed more Kurds than anyone ever did)

Since we helped peshmerga during √ñzal presidency, ( and also since we couldn't prevent the commision of Northern Iraq) we had enough experience of identifying people and everybody were already pissed of whatever Kenan Evren did.

After the assasination of Hrant Dink, the whole perseption of our country (about everything) had changed. And at 2009, government's Kurdish initiative had started. Kurdish language became one of the optional lessons at certain areas, huge economic investments made by state etc... So, things turned normal again. Of course there are still some things that everybody should work on it (like Kurdish people should start to paying their own electricity bills lmao), but we're in a deffinetelly better situation that what people thinks.

If we were communicating face to face, it would be a healthier conversation because i probably forgot more than half of the history and this topic is extremely complicated and has to many aspects but i hope this would help. You can ask anything you want to know. I would like to help you :) 

Very short summary: We love Kurdish people but PKK and PYD can rot in hell.

I'm absolutely not debating the safety of effectiveness of the vaccine.

What I'm saying is, that for those vulnerable groups that have currently received the vaccine, we still need to ensure that they get their second dose to ensure maximum protection.

Completing the first round of vaccinations is a fantastic milestone but it's far from the end of the story, and certainly not a cause for celebration and getting complacent.

AZ's own data shows that it's necessary to have a second dose to ensure sufficient levels of immunity. Their own data shows that it unknown whether the 76% efficacy is constant or whether that will decline over time without a second dose.

There is also, as I previously stated, inconclusive data from preliminary studies to assess efficacy in the over 70s. This isn't my opinion, they say it themselves in The Lancet paper.

It's great that we've got the first round of vaccinations done, but these groups are still massively at risk until the rest of society gets vaccinated as well (even if we assume the 76% efficacy rate is also applicable to these groups,  1 in 4 of them are still at risk of contracting COVID, and for these groups that will be a serious threat to their life)

The vaccine provides 76% protection after a single dose. That's still a 1 in 4 risk of contracting COVID for those vulnerable members of society. Additionally, from trial data it looks as though the vaccine is much less efficient at preventing asymptomatic cases of COVID.

That second dose is imperative for boosting immunity to higher levels (to around 82% efficacy - not perfect but a 1 in 5 risk is much better than a 1 in 4)

As AstraZeneca's own figures suggest in an article published in The Lancet:

4267,"Well we were better off too, our ""golden era"" was actually somewhere around the 1960's, before Ceausescu, he was actually a representative of decline already, and most construction and infrastructure projects halted during his reign, and still didnt restarted, however GDP and industry wise we probably reached peak in the 1980, the problem is that he started exporting a lot and ignored the local economy, so living standards wise the peak was 1960, but economy wise the mid 80s. And then of course the socialist system fell, the 90's was a massive tragedy, full of theft and misery. And barely after 2007 when we entered in the EU we started recovering. We don't have any heavy industry left, only light industry that is mostly foreign owned, and we are mostly a natural resource exporter mixed with some cheap assembly products that come from our sweatshops. In the old era we used to have an actual industry with finished good products, but now it's mostly like that.

4282,"The leadership of the European Commission doesn't have a direct mandate from the electorate as many would like.

This is useful for ensuring accountability by making the head of government, the leader of the legislative majority, and the top party's boss all the same person. The European Union is different.

In the EU the commission president must obtain not only the approval of the European Parliament but also be supported by a supermajority of the European heads of government. You have to find someone that would be supported by 72% of the EU heads of government representing 65% of the EU population. That gives the EU heads of government a pretty strong veto. There was an attempt in both 2014 and 2019 to cut the EU heads of government out of the process, ultimately this failed. Perhaps this was predictable though.

In addition, it has four studies published since the beginning of 2021, in preprints, all of which point in the same direction. Three of them were conducted in the United States and the fourth in Italy. Three followed cohorts of healthcare workers, the last one analysed a panel of blood samples taken at random. All focused their analysis on the messenger RNA vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the most widely deployed. And they all came to the same conclusion: one dose of vaccine injected into a former patient produces an immune response that is as strong, if not stronger, than two doses given to a person who is ""na√Øve"" to the virus.

4302,"Something quite interesting, with **worldwide impact**, happens at 3500 BC: **Neolithic farmers move into southern Scandinavia.**

But first, a side note about vitamins: humans require specific chemical micronutrients which are used as precursors and catalysts in the biological processes which sustain life. Some of these chemicals can be synthesized by humans, and others must be obtained in the diet, and some can be obtained either way, under different circumstances.

Vitamin D is a micronutrient which plays a role in a number of biochemical processes, and is an example of the latter type: it can be obtained in the diet, but can also be synthesized in the human body under the right conditions. Specifically, **Vitamin D synthesis occurs in the skin when it is exposed to UV light** from the sun.

Humans evolved in tropical savannah under direct sunlight in warm conditions. Wearing little or no clothing, with year-round sun, humans were exposed to too much UV -- far more than necessary to synthesize enough Vitamin D, and in fact enough to interfere with other biological processes like cell division. To limit the amount of UV light penetrating the skin, humans evolved melanin pigmentation. This still allowed enough UV still got through to synthesize Vitamin D, but mitigated the effects of high exposure.

Humans didn't stay in the tropics, though. After mastering fire and tool use, humans spread out, migrating beyond the tropics. Humans could now survive cold, wintry conditions, using tools to hunt game and keeping warm with fire and animal skins. And though these humans were covering their skin and were exposed to low-angle, UV-free sunlight for much of the year, it wasn't a huge problem, because (as hunter-gatherers) they were meat-eaters who obtained enough vitamin D through their diet. Other animals have similar biochemical pathways to humans: they can synthesize Vitamin D through sun exposure, and it builds up in their tissues. Plants, however, lack the requisite genetics to produce Vitamin D (and don't need it in their metabolism), so **it cannot be obtained in a plant-based diet.** No problem for those hunter-gatherers, who eat meat.

Enter agriculture. Humans can now obtain enough calories and nutrients to survive from plants alone. Grains and pulses replace meat as the staple protein source: it's no coincidence that every ancient agricultural society has a traditional ""beans and rice""-style dish, whether it's chickpeas and wheat in the Mediterranean, dal and rice in India, soybeans and rice in Asia, or the beans and corn of Mesoamerica: combining these two types of plants provides complete protein for a large number of people.

These agricultural areas have another thing in common, too: they're all tropical or subtropical. Agriculture was discovered independently at least five and maybe up to eight times in human history, with Mesoamerica, East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, the Fertile Crescent, and Papua New Guinea all developing separate farming cultures with different crops. A Stone Age farmer may not be getting as much dietary variety as a hunter-gatherer, but a farming lifestyle can support a much denser population in a given area, and outcompete less-efficient land uses. As a result, **farming culture spread** to any areas that could support the crops.

And that includes one area which, due to a quirk of the current positions of the continents, can support Middle Eastern wheat agriculture at a high latitude. 

Let's take a second digression into thermodynamic weather patterns: hot air rises, cold air sinks. The sun primarily heats the Equator, which (due to geometry) has more incident photons per unit area than areas closer to the poles. Thus, the ground (and the tropical ocean) gets warm, heating the air above it. This air rises to the top of the atmosphere, where (due to gravity) it can't keep going up forever. The low pressure pulls in air from higher latitudes (colder) to take its place, and the heated air spreads north and south through the upper atmosphere, radiating its heat as it moves. This ""polar cell"" is ultimately the root cause of almost all weather patterns on Earth. 

It's not just a straight north-south airflow, though. The earth spins on its axis, which imparts an angular momentum to everything within its gravitational field. Every air molecule spins at the same speed as the ground beneath it (and when the air moves at a different speed from the ground, you feel that as wind). But the closer you get to the axis of rotation, the slower your apparent rotational speed. After all, if you look at a spinning disc, a point halfway to the edge moves through a much smaller circle than a point at the edge. Relative to the center of the Earth, a person standing on the equator must travel 40,000 km per day to complete a single rotation -- a blistering 460 meters per second -- but a person standing at the 45 degree latitude only travels 28,000 km in the same rotation, a mere 320 meters per second. A person at the geographic pole, of course, does not move at all relative to the center of the Earth.

So **at different points on Earth, air molecules move at different speeds**, depending on the speed of the ground below. But the air is only loosely-coupled to the ground, especially as it moves away from the surface (and doesn't bump into trees, mountains, and buildings). In addition, each molecule must obey the law of conservation of angular momentum. Ultimately, as the air moves towards the poles in the upper atmosphere, it continues at the speed it started at until it hits something else. As these molecules move north, they start *also* moving eastward relative to the ground beneath them. Once the molecules are over the mid-latitudes, they're moving, relative to the ground below, about 140 m/s -- the difference between those two speeds above -- and form something called the **""jet stream""**. In general, in the mid-latitudes, due to the rotation of the Earth, the winds blow out of the west, pushing you to the east. We call these winds the **""Westerlies.""**

Air's not the only fluid, though. The oceans are similar: water is heated at the Equator, it expands slightly, and sea levels rise. This expansion causes surface water to flow away from the Equator, toward the poles. However, because of the shape of the North American continent, warm water from the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico can't just flow north -- it, too, is deflected eastward by the coast of South Carolina, resulting in the famous Gulf Stream current of warm water across the Atlantic. The warm water ends up in the North Sea off the coast of Scandinavia, where it finally cools, sinks, and becomes a deep-ocean current that flows back southwards through the Atlantic, ultimately surfacing again off the coast of India.  [This is the best visual I can find for the three-dimensional nature of the ocean currents.](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/d629dd5cc3fe48ea9fc744dada861da0/resources/Ocean_Currents_Red__1524694224110__w1500.jpg)

The shape of North America forces the warm water current to narrow and deflect, bringing lots of tropical heat northwards to Western Europe and Scandinavia. This in turn warms the air above, which blows its warmth across Western Europe and Scandinavia. If you ever wondered why Cornwall (50 degrees north) can support subtropical palm trees while Vladivostok (just 43 degrees north) is a winter hellscape -- this is why.

**This warm, moist air makes one of the world's few high-latitude agricultural zones possible.** The weather in southern Sweden is similar enough (at least in the growing season) to the weather in the Middle East, and of course, the photosynthesis reaction requires light in the visible range. Put in enough hours of direct sunlight in a single growing season, and food comes out; plants don't particularly care if that's low-angle sunlight from long summer days at high latitudes, or high-angle year-round sunlight in the tropics.

But humans care. Low-angle sunlight passes through more atmosphere, filtering out UV light. Humans with melanin-rich skin, in turn, filter out *more* UV light. In the winter, wearing thick clothes, with low-angle sun and dark skin, the human **simply cannot synthesize enough Vitamin D** in his or her skin to meet the daily requirement. Which isn't a problem for any high-latitude population (the Inuit are, in general, quite dark-skinned!) **until they start relying more on plant agriculture for food**. 

As a society starts to transition into high-latitude agriculture, a new selection pressure occurs. Dark skin may no longer strictly be necessary to mitigate the harmful effects of the direct tropical sun -- but it's not harmful, either, to a person with a Vitamin D-rich diet. But when you take away meat, dark skin is suddenly detrimental to survival. Humans with lighter skin can make more-efficient use of the limited winter incident UV radiation, and therefore can survive with less meat in their diet. This allows for more intensive farming at high latitudes, and ultimately results in people with light skin outcompeting people with dark skin, but only in the one region in the world where high-latitude farming was possible.

And that didn't happen until 3500 BC, when Neolithic farmers made it all the way into southern Scandinavia. There, they found a region which *should* be impossible to farm, except for a series of coincidences involving a genetic mutation to the genes which regulate melanin production, tracing back to the thermodynamic flow of heat energy across the Earth, and ultimately, the shapes of the continents themselves.

**TL;DR: White skin has been around about as long as the Pyramids.** By combining our understanding of genetics, biochemistry, paleontology, agriculture, weather patterns and even tapping into our understanding of geometry and physics, we can walk through the series of coincidences that resulted in the evolution of white skin.",,/r/europe/comments/li7t0g/10000_years_of_european_history/gn3eys2/,caballero_jetable,1613159735

4515,"Navalny is worse than Putin. 

Putin is a bad guy, but a mob style figure - he's ultimately pragmatic and in it mostly for himself so he wants to keep the gravy train going.

Navalny is a true believer, which makes him far worse. This is a guy who marched with actual neo-nazis. This is a man who sincerely belives in Great Russia irrendentism - not as an expediency to stay in power and get rich. This is a guy who made ""Stop Feeding the Caucasus"" - dogwhistle to ""let ethnic minorities starve"" a motto. 
The idea that Navalny is better than Putin because he's not corrupt is flat out crazy and a sign of the infantilization of our society. 

&gt;""‚ÄúOf all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience"".

People who support Navalny to oust Putin remind me of those people a few years ago who wanted to oust Assad in Syria and then we all got ISIS. 

There are plenty of Russian politicians who oppose Putin and also oppose the annexation of Crimea, wars against Georgia, expansionism, Russian supremacism, irredentism, don't engage in violent anti-minorities rhetoric and so on.

4649,"&gt;Less than two weeks after its success in Greece, Dassault Aviation has just been selected by the Croatian authorities as one of the two finalists in the competition to replace the 12 Mig-21s of the air force that will be retired from service in 2023. However, the commission in charge of the tender did not communicate the conclusions of its evaluation, leaving it to the Zagreb government to select the winner. The political as well as the operational nature of this decision may help assess the chances of the Rafale.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Last Round**  
&gt;  
&gt;In January 2020, the Croatian interministerial commission in charge of evaluating the various candidates applying for the replacement of the venerable Mig-21 LanceR, issued a RFP (Request for Proposal) to several countries. While two of them offered new aircraft, the American F-16V and the Swedish Gripen C/D MS 20, the others offered second-hand aircraft, such as Italy with its Eurofighters, France with the Rafale to the latest F3 standard, but also Norway, Greece and Israel, all three of which offered F-16s. After an initial filtering process that eliminated the Norwegian and Greek F-16s, it is now the turn of the Gripen and Israeli F-16s to bow out. The choice of the Rafale came as no surprise to public opinion, nor even the ousting of the Swedes or Israelis. Admittedly, Gripen, already operated in Central Europe by the Hungarians and Czechs, was well suited to Croatia's financing capabilities, and the Swedes had even proposed an amount of investment in the country equal to the amount of the package, i.e. 1 Geur. But with the evolution of the external threat, and after a relentless media campaign, the Swedish offer was considerably weakened. Israel was a critical partner of the Croatian Air Force, which in 2002 had entrusted the Aerostar/Elbit JV with the modernization of 12 Mig-21s to the LanceR standard. The aim was to make them compatible with NATO STANAG standards, as well as to equip them with modern equipment in terms of avionics (HUD Elop 921, MFCD, HOTAS, INS), sensors (Radar EL/M-2001B, electronic warfare pod ELL-8222 R) and short-range air-to-air missiles (Magic II, Python 3). But above all in March 2018, Zagreb chose to replace them with second-hand Israeli F-16 Ds modernized to Barak (lightning) standard.   
&gt;  
&gt;**New Context**  
&gt;  
&gt;However, the situation has suddenly changed. First of all, Croatia is not taking off since the failure of this acquisition. In January 2019, Washington opposed the resale of the Barack F-16s for $500 million on the grounds that the technology transfers granted on this aircraft could not be transferred to a third party. And more specifically on the performance of the radar and the electronic warfare system, which had seduced the Croatian authorities because of their ability to track and destroy enemy ground/air capabilities. However, the Israeli authorities had certified from the start of talks with the Croatian Minister of Defense Damir Krsticevic that Washington would have no objection. Despite strong lobbying by B. Netanyahu to Mr. Pompeo, the Director General of the Israeli Defense Ministry, Udi Adam, had no choice but to come to Zagreb to officially apologize. This misadventure demonstrated that even if these devices had been modernized by Israeli industrialists, they often remain dependent on the goodwill of the Pentagon regarding their technological innovations. In addition, the geostrategic context has become more radical on the borders of Croatia. If Zagreb follows with great attention the activity of Turkey in Bosnia-Herzegovina, like the Islamist radicalization that is proliferating there, it is even more worried about the return in force of the Serbian air threat. Belgrade has indeed benefited from a donation of 14 Mig-29 offered by Russia and Belarus, which could be supplemented by 8 additional aircraft. In addition, it is planning to strengthen its ground/air defense capabilities. Following the acquisition of several Pantsir short-range systems, it is conducting negotiations with Beijing for the purchase of several HQ-22 medium-range systems. Finally, last summer it received the first batch of a series of 24 Chinese CH-92A ground attack UAVs.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Political choice**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Rafale will therefore have to face the American F-16 Viper, which not only integrates technologies directly from fifth-generation aircraft such as the F-35 or F-22 (data fusion, collaborative combat, etc.), but also promises to carry all the US Air Force's available and future weapons. However, two points would weaken its offer. To get back into the budget, Lockheed would not be able to provide as many aircraft as Dassault. Indeed, in July 2019, the Bulgarian government had to release nearly 1.1 Geur to launch the acquisition of only 8 of these aircraft. In addition, while these aircraft were favored by the previous Croatian Defense Minister, Damir Krsticevic, Washington's blockade on technology transfers of Israeli F-16s has left its mark. Many decision-makers are convinced that the performance of the American aircraft would be severely degraded. A situation that therefore favors the Rafale, especially since according to some local contacts, the French aircraft are favored by the military. Thanks to the Rafale, Croatia would have an operational and technological capacity without comparison in the Balkans (apart from Greece). Moreover, and contrary to the F-16, it is available in the very short term since the aircraft are already in stock within the Air Force. Added to this is the political dimension. Indeed, the new Croatian Defense Minister Mario Banozic has been hammering home his desire for a European solution ever since his appointment. This position was reinforced by the visit on January 14 of the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian, who is a connoisseur of the Rafale dossier after managing to sell it three times (India, Egypt, Qatar). Although cooperation with the United States is strategic for the Croatian government, it is primarily seeking the support of France, which will hold the presidency of the EU in 2022. Not only to obtain its opposition to Serbia's integration into the European concert, to join the Schengen area, but above all to benefit from massive economic aid that would allow it to revive growth after an earthquake, the consequences of COVID on tourism, and the return of ultra-nationalist parties during the last elections.",France,/r/europe/comments/libja3/rafale_croatia_dassault_on_the_verge_of_success/gn243pn/,Ra75b,1613138412

&gt; the UK's vaccination program has nothing to do with Brexit. This fake news has already been debunked.

It's true that a) The UK wouldn't not have been compelled to sign up to the joint procurement scheme, and b) That the MHRA could have authorised vaccines before the EMA regardless. 

However, there was clearly political pressure for member states to go along with the Commissions procurement scheme and to wait for EMA approval before distributing any vaccines to their own citizens.

This can be seen in the fact than no significant EU member states went against the joint procurement process, or relied on their own authorisation. The UK was widely ridiculous, in British and foreign media, for not taking part in the EU's scheme, I find it difficult to see how (had there been no EU referendum) the UK would have chosen to go it alone. Brexit gave the government some political cover for not subscribing to the broader EU effort. 

&gt; It did so quicker because it didn't wait for regulator approval

This is just dumb. Everybody bought vaccines before regulatory approval was granted, countries were placing orders whilst the vaccines were still in early trials. And every single one of the EU's initial orders was placed before any candidates had received EMA approval. 

&gt; The EU countries just chose not to be too hasty without, you know, actually checking if the vaccine is safe.

Again, this is misleading bollocks. The UK regulator took all necessary steps to verify the safety of the vaccines that have been approved, the EMA was not privileged to any extra data (as I've seen some people try to claim on this sub), nor were they more rigorous.",United Kingdom - We hold all the fish ,/r/europe/comments/li6ss5/brexit_cost_will_be_four_times_greater_for_uk/gn24d62/,MyFavouriteAxe,1613138553

&gt;Certainly. As soon as the original contract is finished, AZ will export abroad as there is no export ban, de facto or otherwise.

There is certainly a de facto ban as it is not making export until the contract is fulfilled.

De facto: existing or holding a specified position in fact but not necessarily by legal right.

In fact the export are ban because the contract is not fulfilled. Even if it is not a law, that still fit the meaning of the word.

4726,"Where do we even begin:

AirBnb Exploits everyone. 

As a host, if your tenants become a problem, Airbnb is usually reclusive, takes too long to respond and generally tries to wave responsibility.

As a tenant, its scary. Anyone can become a ""host"", there are no verification or requirements. People have found hidden cameras, but I'll go as far to say that more people haven't found the cameras/mics in their room, during their stay.

In general, if something goes wrong. Airbnb immediately goes into silent mode and tries to duck responsibility. They don't have your back, regardless of which party it is.

Then comes the bigger issue. Airbnb is a leech. They ""act"" like a Hotel, without following any regulations and they don't get taxed as a Hotel. In the meantime, the savings are not passed down to the customer, they are pocketed by Airbnb.
 
Uber is doing the SAME exact thing. Instead of the hotel industry, they are doing it to the transportation industry.

Essentially their business plan is - let's do what these guys are doing, but let's mask ourselves as a Tech company to skirt all regulations. Thus they effectively speed-run capitalism and funnel wealth to a singular spot. Take the money from everyone and ghost them if they have a problem.

It wouldn't be as bad (economically, socially it would still be exploitative), if there were more competitors, but as it stands, they are horrendous.

You might enjoy their service and feel conflicted, but that doesn't change what they do to the economy, and society, in general. When few companies have so much money, it tends to be bad for society in the long run.

Why these companies have so much funding? Because it's an amazing business plan, if you only care about profit. As a company, you make more money, for doing less and legally you're not responsible. You can stonewall your customers and most places have no laws regulating your activity.

The gig economy is a scam, very well done, very well ran, but a scam nonetheless. It funnels money to even fewer people and brings wealth-inequality to a whole new level.",,/r/europe/comments/li6yne/new_spanish_law_to_make_food_delivery_workers/gn1t4lh/,A78BECAFB33DD95,1613131032

4739,"&gt; It's obviously the opposite: once you sign trade deals, you lose any leverage you might have. If you simply trade under GATT terms, then you can use the potential for trade deals to force them to implement reforms. 

No. The entire point of the EU is that it is not so. The entire point of the EU is: If countries trade a lot, they won't want to go to war with each other, because a war would then cause unemployment and economic damage in their own country.

It's really odd we have an EU based on that idea ""trade causes peace"", and then so many people really don't believe in it anymore.

&gt;This is literally a CCP propaganda line that has been mercilessly mocked in the last couple of years. It's absolutely amazing there are still people parroting it in 2021. Someone should tell this to the people in HK or Tibet. 

It's not, it's based on looking at Chinese history, and how they consider themselves to be the empire in the middle, and the rest of the world to be so much below them that it isn't even worth for them to spread their culture and create a coloniat empire.

If you had ANY idea of history AT ALL, you would know that HK IS in fact Chinese, it's as Chinese as Liverpool is English and Hamburg is German. 

The UK ""rented"" HK for a 100 years, which was forced un China as they were weak at the time. The rent period expired, and they want it back in China completelt.

Tibet was ""just"" independant 1912-1950. It was Chinese 1720 to 1912, and it became independant because China was in chaos. As soon as China again had a central government they took it back.

IF you gave a shit about history, you would know: The areas China are interested in, are ONLY those that used to be part of China and that they lost in their chaos period 1900-1945. 

They have no interest in getting control over completelt new areas, like say they'd never invade South Africa and make it a colony.

The CCP also does not export it's ideology. They do not say they have a universal ideology, and all countries should adop their way.

In contrast, the hit for the EU is estimated to be about 0.5% over the same period.

Brexit trade arrangements are ‚Äòunmitigated disaster‚Äô, food industry experts say

'Food exports to EU have declined by 50 to 60 per cent in January,' one leader says

Zoe Tidman

Some companies have been forced to close permanently, committee told

(Getty Images)

Brexit has been called an ‚Äúunmitigated disaster‚Äù by food industry experts, as they told MPs about the impact of new trade arrangements.¬†

Sector leaders told the International Trade Select Committee the cost of disruption hads already caused some businesses to shut their doors for good.¬†

The Brexit trade deal secured on Christmas Eve left businesses just days to prepare for changes, which came into force in the new year. 

Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), told MPs on Thursday food exports have been cut by at least half since the start of January despite the deal.¬†

He told the committee: ""We agree with other trade groups that food exports to the EU have declined by 50 to 60 per cent in January.


""That may be because companies have stockpiled three or four months of goods on the other side of the Channel and they may bounce back, but that is a big number to recover in the next few months.""

Promoted stories

He said he was ""particularly concerned"" about uncertainty among officials overseeing new trade checks.


""This is not trivialising it, but in many cases they are making it up as they go along, because they don't know what would happen with particular certificates,"" he said.


Mr Wright also warned that the UK could be ""50,000 customs agents"" short of what is needed when import regulations are enforced from April.

Marine and fisheries consultant Terri Portmann told MPs that seafood businesses are already shutting amid the impact of Brexit disruption.


""It has been an unmitigated disaster,"" she said on Thursday.

""We have already seen seafood businesses who heavily relied upon an export market close their doors ‚Äì companies that have been around for 30 to 40 years.

""And I suspect there are many more that are currently hanging on by their fingernails and going bankrupt slowly, because part of the problem is that with fresh seafood products, you can't stockpile.""

There are certain ROI projects that are necessary to keep the whole economy on track but overall my point stands. I am 100% with you on the invest smarter side of your argument. I just dont see how investing less is the only way to archive that.  


&gt;Everytime corporate and capital taxes are raised the argument is companies will leave. However a shrinking share of the consumer market also impels other, consumer oriented companies to leave or never come. The system is prioritizing one economic segment over the other.

Wait... so your argument is to let them leave? Because leave they will. We have seen this countless times already.
What you seem to prpose here is a simple trick. Its Stiftung your economic model from an manufacturing based economy to a service oriented economy. 

&gt;Germany slash capital and corporate tax rates to the bone

I never wrote that and thats not how Germany does it. What youre doing here is making a strawman argument.


&gt;Brain drain is exacerbated by this phenomenon as wages are lower. 

This is a bold claim since you probably very well know that the low income section of the economy does generally not extend to the higher educated workforce. Also your plan to increase in progression in the income tax would be the main reason for income reduction with higher educated workers.

&gt;Greece continues to increase tensions with provocative acts in the Eastern Mediterranean, most recently by testing its Russian S-300 air defense missile system during a military drill on the Greek island of Crete, **security sources** said Monday.

&gt;**Security sources** told the Sabah daily that Greece‚Äôs actions pressurize already strained tensions in the region. Turkey and Greece are at odds over a variety of issues, including maritime borders and drilling activities in the Eastern Mediterranean.

4978,"A  Danish-developed vaccine from the University of Copenhagen is a strong  bid for an effective weapon against corona, according to leading vaccine  researchers. The expectation is that testing on humans will begin this month

The  hope is light green with regard to the vaccine against covid-19, which  has been developed at the University of Copenhagen, and which is  expected to start being tested on humans at the end of this month.

The  vaccine is based on a new technology that the researchers at the  university have been working on for 15 years, and they themselves  believe that there is reason to believe that the vaccine has something  special to offer - if it succeeds in the clinical trials and when up to  the population.

""I  expect that our vaccine will activate a strong response from the immune  system and also work significantly better than many others against new  virus variants, ie mutants,"" says Ali Salanti, professor at the  Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the University of  Copenhagen.

The  expectation is supported by the American professor Bryce Chackerian  from the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, who researches  vaccines based on similar technology and who has followed the work at  the University of Copenhagen closely.

‚ÄúI  believe that their vaccine has several advantages over other vaccines  that have already been approved or are in the late stages of clinical  trials. One of them is  that it indicates that their vaccine will provoke a very strong response  from the immune system, ‚Äùhe writes in an email about his expectations  for a high effect.

New virus variants such as the South African seem to be less sensitive to antibodies, he continues; the vaccines simply risk being worse, as seen with Astrazeneca's vaccine against the South African mutant.

‚ÄúBut if you can produce very high levels of antibodies, then it's less worrying. So there is potential for the Copenhagen vaccine to better protect against new virus strains, ‚Äùwrites Bryce Chackerian.

S√∏ren  Riis Paludan, professor at the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus  University, also believes that the Danish vaccine has potential.

He has seen data from the experiments in monkeys and mice, and ""it looks promising"", he says:

‚ÄúAfter  the first wave of vaccines, which are the ones we have now, there will  be another wave where some vaccines will be targeted at new virus  variants; some will provide better immunity and some will work better in the weak groups we do not succeed in vaccinating now. In that race, I think it is a strong candidate to become one of the best. ‚Äù

However, he emphasizes that everything is ""theory"", as long as the clinical trials have not been completed.

The Statens Serum Institut is also developing a vaccine against covid-19. It is based on a different technology than the vaccine offer from the University of Copenhagen.

5024,"To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have taken a variety of restrictive measures since the beginning of 2020. The air transport industry was hit immediately.

The first impact was visible in March 2020, with a 44% decrease in the total number of commercial flights (passengers, freight and mail) in the EU compared with the same month in 2019. With COVID-19 restrictions in full effect and changes in travel preferences, the most substantial falls in the number of commercial flights were recorded in April (-91% compared with the same month in 2019), May (-90%) and June (-84%).

During the peak summer months, there was only a partial recovery, with falls of 64% in July and 53% in August, with further decreases observed in September (-59%), October (-62%), November (-68%), December (-67%), with no signs of recovery in the new year: January 2021 (-68% compared with same month in 2020).

Although the extent of the impact and path to a recovery varies across EU Member States, the largest decrease in the number of commercial flights was observed in April in 21 Member States, while May recorded the largest decrease in the remaining 6 EU Member States.

Following unprecedented decreases in the number of commercial flights in 2020, the pandemic continued to impact a vast majority of EU airports in 2021.

In January 2021, the largest decreases in the number of commercial flights were recorded in major European air transport hubs: M√ºnchen (-25 400 commercial flights compared with January 2020, -85%), Paris/Charles de Gaulle (-23 500, -63%), Amsterdam/Schiphol (-23 100, -61%), Frankfurt/Main (-23 100, -64%) and Madrid/Barajas (-22 900, -70%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/li5ahe/commercial_air_transport_in_the_eu_a_long_haul_to/gn16igc/,filosoful,1613110768

Same with homicide. 100 homicides in 2010, then 0 for 7 years and 120 in 2018 would give you a 20% increase on your map. It's not a progress chart if you only use two years. If you want to represent progress, do a line chart so people can see the direction it trends towards.

Well it was also stated pretty openly they wanted to force euro trading of all regards into the block. That failed spectacularly as it mostly moved to New York.

5276,"&gt; What it effectively means is that the new covid antimeasures will have to be targeted and cannot be country-wide.

If I understand correctly, the goal of the Pirates is to atop using state of emergency authority and use explicitly-legislatively-granted authority.  I can understand the rationale there in the sense that the executive is there to work quickly, where the legislature has no time to be involved, and states of emergency grant the executive a broader scope of authority for crises.  The pandemic has been going on for a while and new unexpected, rapid actions probably aren't necessary, so it's possible to return to a non-emergency state of affairs and let the legislature grant powers explicitly.

However, I don't understand the argument for moving control down to a region level.  In fact, I think that this may be one major weakness in even the (federal) US, not to mention the EU.

You want to centralize power when you have to make a decision that affects everyone.  Who do you side with in a war, say ‚Äî the whole country has to act together.

And you want to decentralize power when the decisions made can operate pretty well independently, in isolation.

One region's actions here can have major implications for other states.  Like, a region that depends on tourism may want to open up for business. A region that does not may want to keep things closed.

But the tourism region opening for business affects the other regions.  Like, if it's spreading disease elsewhere due to free population movement, that affects those regions.

In the Austria/Tyrol case yesterday, Tyrol apparently is adamant that it must make money from tourism, regardless of the impact from the disease.  Austria said ""okay, but then we're going to try to limit the costs to you via screening at the border"" (which I doubt will work well, as the screening won't catch everyone).

It seems to me that within a region that enjoys free population movement, the decisions would ideally be centralized.  And that's not just to force the tourism region to close, but because if the tourism region is closed for the benefit of the office region, then the office region should arguably bear part of the costs od supporting the tourism region, as it is enjoying some of the benefits.

I don't think that there's a realistic alternative to disentangle interests of regions other than having an actual quarantine building that you have to wait in for two weeks when crossing the border of the region.  If that could be done, then regions could probably reasonably make their own calls.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/lhx3uc/czech_parliament_refused_to_prolong_the_state_of/gn0jpac/,duisThias,1613097240

It's like the Ship of Theseus, it's not really the same government, or the same state. In its current form, it's not morally responsible for things that happened hundreds of years ago. 

The further back you go, the less tenuous is the case for apologies, guilt or reparations.

&gt; They were the crimes of the british state.

This just makes you whitewash lots of history because very few states have the political stability and longevity of the entity with constitutes Britain.

By your logic, if the UK has transformed itself into a constitutional, federal republic in the 1950s, you'd say that the current state had no responsibility for any crimes committed by the empire - because obviously its not a continuation of the previous system.

5311,"Average salary in Vilnius after tax: ~1000eur  
Beer price in an average bar downtown 3.5  
Amount of beers monthly net salary can buy: 285  

In order to buy the same 285 beers a month in London, average wage has to be 285 * 6 = 1710eur (1500gbp) after tax per month.  

However!  

Buying one pint of beer in London will get you 68ml more beer than buying a regular beer in Vilnius (0.5L), although the trend is now getting closer to 0.4L.. Anyhow. So if we adjust for the volume of beer relative to the optimistic 0.5L in Vilnius, you can buy 285 * 0.5L = ~142L of beer a month in Vilnius. While for the same volume of beer you need to buy only ~250 beers in London (285/0.56826125). Therefore, volume adjusted, we're looking at
250*6=1500eur (1300gbp) after tax a month to buy the same amount of beer a month as an average person in Vilnius.

It's hard to find average net salary in London, but if it's this low after tax, then it sucks and you'd have 2x the quality of life living in Vilnius. Otherwise - enjoy your cheap beer :P",üá±üáπ in üá©üá∞,/r/europe/comments/lgsb5j/eslalit/gn01oxn/,climsy,1613087838

5459,"&gt; Nuclear is extremely effective at producing base load, since it doesn't really cost more to produce electricity than it cost just sitting there.

It's not different from renewables in that characteristic.

&gt;Wind and solar, at the moment, are not really reliable enough to provide base-load and they're really not suited to provide peak load either.

They are, however, the cheapest source available. Given the fact that we need flexible supplementation or storage either way, it makes more sense to use renewables to produce a bulk load, and use some of the saved money to build more storage. In the end, it's cheaper.

&gt;Effectively, at the moment, if you want to increase Wind/solar production, you have to increase your coal/gas/fuel production capacity in parallel (or Hydro, but most countries are already maxed out or close to maxed out on it, and it also has quite a few environmental drawbacks). Energy storage at the moment is not on the table for countries the size of Germany/Poland/France...

You can go to quite a high percentage of renewables on the grid even without storage, no country has maximized that capacity yet. So there's more progress to be made.

And then there are numerous storage projects going on, the most promising ones are synthetic gas, because that can just be used to replace the gas in the pipe network, making a smooth transition and converting the existing gas plants to carbon neutral.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/lhi3tx/race_to_phaseout_coal_the_uk_vs_germany/gmznekz/,silverionmox,1613081017

Hungarian Revolution of 1956
Basically an uprising within the Warsaw Pact states so might not be morally fine but would be deemed internal affairs I guess

Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, 1968

Also an internal conflict of the Warsaw Pact as Czechoslovakia was a member state. Operation had 137 death and 500 wounded.

Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War (1979‚Äì1989)
After a communist coup the country went into turmoil and the Soviet Union did send in an army to secure power, invasion by the western point of view intervention from the sowjet view point.

Russo-Georgian War, 2008
Was started by Georgia during Olympic Games which is traditionally peace time with us support and training when they wanted to reintegrate separatist territory. War began with Georgian artillery shelling Russian peacekeeping forces.

Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014‚Äìpresent)

2 soldiers killed 60 detained 
After a probably encouraged coup the new pro western forces started to shell eastern cities in Ukraine that did not want to follow the coup as they have mainly Russian backgrounds.

Russia did than secure its biggest base in the Black Sea which is also mainly populated by ethnic Russians.
And probably also supported pro Russian troops in the don bass conflict

You might want to add Syria where the Russians support the government after being asked for help

I would not really call Russia a war monger based on this.

Meanwhile the us:
1950-53 Korea war
1961 Cuba (bay of pigs)
1961-73 Vietnam war
1965 Dominican Republic 
1982 Lebanon 
1983 Grenada
1989 Panama
1991 gulf war
1993 Somalia
1994 Haiti
1994-95 Bosnia
1999 Kosovo
2001-2021 Afghanistan
2003-2010 Iraq (still troops there 11 years later)
2011 Libya
2012-2019 isis war

It was actually.. A secret that AZ should have either reveiled or avoid to allow EU money for UK plants.

&gt;The EU didn't require exclusivity from EU based plants, that's clear from the contract they released and didn't redact property. Probably saved them allot of money upfront as a result even if they now seem to be having second thoughts.

Never was an issue. We never asked for exclusivity. Not even when they said they can't deliver.

&gt;The Belgium plant didn't say they weren't having problems they said they complied with there contractual obligations with AZ which they did.

No. They said they met their deliveries. Meaning no production problems and they've produced everything that was requested and had no issues, which were the main reasons stated by AZ for the delays.

Now, if AZ didn't ask them for enough doses and then realized this, that's AZ's problem, not the Belgium's plant.

5548,"&gt;and allied bombing missions sure as fuck didn't discriminate between Germany and German occupied.

They did discriminate between Germany and occupied territory.

From Richard G Davis, official historian of the USAF, setting out British bombing policy:

&gt;In  occupied  countries,  bombing  was  confined  to ‚Äúmilitary objectives‚Äù only; the following rules applied:  
&gt;  
&gt;1.  Bombing of civilian populations, as such, forbidden,  
&gt;  
&gt;2.  The objective must be identified,  
&gt;  
&gt;3.  The attack must be made with reasonable care to avoid undue loss of  civilian  life  and  if  any  doubt  exists  as  to  accuracy  or  an  error would involve the risk of serious loss to a populated area, make no attack, and  
&gt;  
&gt;4.  Observe the provisions of the Red Cross conventions.

and

&gt;The  concern  for  their  own  and  for  the  people  of  their  subjugated allies did not extend to the enemy. In two pithy sentences Air Vice-Marshal John C. Slessor, assistant chief of staff (policy), who  issued  the  instructions,  wrote,  ‚Äúconsequent  upon  the enemy‚Äôs adoption of a campaign of unrestricted air warfare, the Cabinet  have  \[sic\]  authorized  a  bombing  policy  which  includes the  attack  of  enemy  morale.  The  foregoing  rules  governing  the policy to be observed in enemy occupied countries do not, therefore, apply in our conduct of air warfare against German, Italian, and  Japanese  territory,  except  that  the  provisions  of  the  Red Cross Conventions are to be continued to be observed.‚Äù

Davis also notes that the head of the USAAF in Europe, Carl Spaatz, told the 8th Air Force to '‚Äúconduct  its  operations  in  accordance  with  the  rules  as  set forth‚Äù in the RAF memo.'

However, Davis notes that in 1942 and 1943 the USAAF was mainly attacking targets in occupied Europe, not Germany, and their accuracy did not allow them to follow the rules:

&gt;Strict compliance with the directive would have halted American heavy bomber operations. The Eighth would appear to have made no changes to bring its day-to-day operations into compliance with the new policy.

Davis also notes that the RAF did not strictly follow these rules with regard to German U boat bases at Lorient and St Nazaire. 

General Doolittle's later instructions for attacks by the 8th AF using radar bombing (which was very inaccurate):

&gt;a.  Unrestricted  Areas.  Any  military  targets  in  Germany  proper  more than 50 miles from occupied territory may be attacked under any conditions provided the mission instructions of the field order are followed.  
&gt;  
&gt;b.  Restricted Areas. Military targets in Germany proper that are in a zone less than 50 miles from occupied territory may be attacked if they  can  be  positively  identified,  bombed  visually,  and  attacked without any risk of bombs falling in occupied territory.   
&gt;  
&gt;c.  Occupied  Territory.  Only  those  targets  listed  in  the  field  order  for the  particular  operation  may  be  attacked  in  occupied  territory. When these targets are so obscured that normal bombing accuracy cannot be expected, the bombs will not be released.

There were of course operations where the value of the target overrode the risk to the civilian population, but in general, allied bombing policy sought to minimise civilian casualties in occupied territory, and maximise them (or at least were indifferent to) in enemy territory.",,/r/europe/comments/lhhcfh/bombs_dropped_in_wwii_in_europe/gmz6mvt/,WhiteSatanicMills,1613073773

London's trading volume is 5x greater than the entire EU combined - it really is a global centre. Equivalence would have been better, but in this particular instance it is the EU being a little petty - there are a lot of places with equivalency that are far less aligned than London, equivalence isn't applicabke to most areas of trade, and the UK granted equivalency to EU firms as a gesture of good will in that area. But that's the EU's prerogative, so there's no point complaining. It also won't make much difference. London will look outward whilst the EU looks inward for financial market growth. Both are in a position to grow if done properly.

Re the qualifications, it's again a pain but not a deal breaker. There will be short term disruption but it really just means that individual bodies have to grant it.

5601,"Well they knew that the longer the war went on the lower the chance for success would be. And a strategic bombing campaign that builds up over years was never an option because they would lose that very time if the allies did the same, which they in fact did.

So they never really put much effort into producing larger bombers. Germany had large aircraft (BV 222, BV 238, Ju90/290 etc.) but always saw more use in smaller more tactical aircraft.

So from that perspective the german doctrine for aerial warfare made total sense, but got into more and more problems the more the offensive initiative shifted away.

Only in late 1944 did they decide to stop producing bombers all together and focus primarily on producing fighters (""J√§gernotprogramm"" - Emergency Fighter Program). Far too late of course. Had they decided to do so in 42 or early 43 the Allied bombing campain could have had much much higher losses.

**Intercepts from an encrypted messaging service used by criminals are now admissible in court, Catherine Baksi reports**

Judges rejected a bid last week to prevent evidence of messages obtained from EncroChat, an encrypted phone network, being used in a criminal trial.

In a victory for prosecutors in their fight against organised crime the Court of Appeal ruled that communications obtained by French police by hacking into mobile phones were lawfully obtained.

But defence lawyers warn that the judgment creates ambiguity over the meaning of terms used in English law and opens the door to allow evidence that would normally be excluded.

Chaman Salhan, a solicitor at the law firm 2nd Opinion Now who styles himself as ‚Äúthe Encro defender‚Äù, says: ‚ÄúYou can understand why the Court of Appeal was reluctant to throw the evidence out. But we need to be careful that we don‚Äôt jeopardise the principles of freedom and democracy that we hold dear. Here the courts have allowed a foreign power, which won‚Äôt tell you how it‚Äôs done it, to say that people are guilty.‚Äù

The case came after it emerged last summer that EncroChat ‚Äî a Dutch business that developed an encrypted secure mobile phone instant messaging service ‚Äî had been infiltrated by the French and Dutch authorities, who shared the information they garnered with the National Crime Agency (NCA) in London.

The NCA said that about 10,000 criminals in Britain used EncroChat for the sole purpose of co-ordinating and planning their activities, and described its breach as the biggest breakthrough in the fight against organised crime.

Historically, under English law the authorities could obtain intercept material, via phone tapping for example, but that information could not be used as evidence in criminal trials.

That rule, which is designed to protect the methods used by the security services and law enforcement agencies, contrasts with the approach in many other jurisdictions, including the Netherlands and France.",,/r/europe/comments/lhqid0/hacked_messages_can_be_used_as_evidence_in_court/gmypjzu/,quixotic_cynic,1613066618
5664,"[2]

However, the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 ‚Äî often dubbed the ‚Äúsnoopers‚Äô charter‚Äù ‚Äî allows communications from phones and computers to be used in evidence if obtained by ‚Äúequipment interference‚Äù; that is to say, hacking.

Lawyers for the defendants in the EncroChat case argued that the messages were inadmissible because they were intercepted in real time while ‚Äúbeing transmitted‚Äù. The prosecution said that the messages were admissible because they were ‚Äústored‚Äù on the devices and sourced by ‚Äúequipment interference‚Äù.

The authorities have not revealed their techniques, but the court explained that French police found a way to send an implant to all EncroChat devices in the world under cover of an apparent software update. That implant caused them to transmit all the data held to the French police.

Sitting in the Court of Appeal, the lord chief justice Lord Burnett of Maldon, Lord Justice Edis and Mrs Justice Whipple said that the ‚Äúcommunications were extracted directly from the handset of the user and not while they were travelling to, through or from any other part of the system‚Äù, and crucially therefore while they were ‚Äústored‚Äù temporarily on the devices.

The judges ruled that the material was obtained lawfully using ‚Äúequipment interference‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúinterception‚Äù, and there was no bar to its use as evidence in criminal proceedings.

A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‚ÄúWe are pleased that the court agrees that this material was properly acquired and can be used as evidence in these important cases. This ruling is consistent with our longstanding position on using intercepted material as evidence and in keeping with how we expect material from equipment interference to be treated.‚Äù

Defence lawyers expressed unease at the ruling, which they claimed opened the way to the admission of new classes of intercepted evidence that the law had so far deemed inadmissible.

One solicitor acting for defendants in cases involving EncroChat evidence who wanted to remain anonymous explains: ‚ÄúThe reality is that the evidence was live and had the information been obtained in this country it wouldn‚Äôt have been admissible.‚Äù

Trevor Francis, a solicitor at the law firm Blackfords, suggests that while the infiltration amounted to a hack, the court made a ‚Äúpublic policy judgment‚Äù.",,/r/europe/comments/lhqid0/hacked_messages_can_be_used_as_evidence_in_court/gmypkml/,quixotic_cynic,1613066626
5665,"[3]

Francis adds that ‚Äúreading between the lines the Court of Appeal is effectively saying that the EncroChat system only exists for criminal purposes and they are not going to prevent evidence being admissible where it is obtained by prosecuting authorities from such a system‚Äù.

Lord Carlile of Berriew, QC, a former independent reviewer of terror laws, insists that the ruling does not change the law, but instead clarifies how encrypted material obtained from storage in another jurisdiction can be used in evidence in England and Wales.

‚ÄúThere is a danger that the rationale of the case will be misunderstood,‚Äù Carlile says, and he suggests that the government should ask the Law Commission to review its consequences.

The appeal judges suggested that, given the outcome, others looking to challenge EncroChat evidence ‚Äúshould not be surprised if the trial judges deal with them rather more briskly‚Äù.

But Salhan, who is acting in 25 per cent of all EncroChat cases in the UK, suggests that it would be wrong to presume that there will be a rush of guilty pleas, insisting that this is ‚Äújust the beginning‚Äù of the legal challenges. He says that the volume of cases he is dealing with has highlighted ‚Äúproblems and anomalies‚Äù that question the integrity of the EncroChat material.

However, he adds, the inability of the defence to check the source of the material means they cannot examine the possibility that material has been edited, manipulated or produced by the result of a technical glitch.

Observers expect defendants to seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.",,/r/europe/comments/lhqid0/hacked_messages_can_be_used_as_evidence_in_court/gmyplav/,quixotic_cynic,1613066633

A conclusion that is still wrong. If you look up definitions of the work ""Socialism"" you'll find out:

&gt; Socialism is a political, social and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and democratic control or workers' self-management of enterprises

Now, if you can show (e.g. by refering to the party program) that these parties actually want to do that (transfer the means of production into social ownership), then you'd be right.

But as you cannot do that, we can still say ""they are leftist parties"", but we cannot say ""they are socialist parties"". They simply don't want to erect a socialistic government form.

5739,"&gt; I just don't think there are large innate differences.

I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree here. I think there's some very big differences. One obvious example is the physical differences between men and women.

&gt;  Before the agricultural age women and men mostly did the same things, there was no role system. Then with the agricultural age, roles started appearing.

(Your statement isn't exactly accurate, gender roles might have become more prevalent after, but they did exist pre the agricultural age)

I think you're agreeing with me, women did the same jobs out of necessity, just like we see much higher enrollment in STEM in Saudi arabia than Sweden, necessity.

More economic freedom allowed those differences to manifest, I think we'd also agree that there are physical differences that make men more suited for some tasks, and women for others.

Child rearing is clearly a womens role, men cannot bear children, that's not something imposed by society, it's just something imposed by nature, this doesn't make one gender better or worse, it just makes us different, and that's ok.

&gt;  So if there are differences then something isn't really equal.

I agree, something isn't really equal, men and women aren't the same, I just don't think that's a bad thing.",,/r/europe/comments/lhh9gl/female_researchers_as_a_percentage_of_total/gmy7thz/,Hugogs10,1613059293

Would you find them long term, robust option?    
What about nice wooden boxes, in the shapes of trees, with leaves on them? Still no?   

Ok, fine, now you have millions of tons of carbon stored in wood, what do you do with it for the next ""hundreds of thousand years""? How do you prevent them to, I don't know, burn (which only gets more probable year after year)? And that is without counting the surface area now reserve for these forests; no solar panels, no dwellings, no wind turbine, no agriculture, no grazing, this area is now reserved as carbon landfills.    



As for putting things in the ground, for long term storage, I prefere the geological stability of undergroud, engineered, monitored storage where to put a a **solid** compared to a **gaz under pressure** in an cave that has been bored through.    

For carbon storage, the only long term stable solution I am willing to consider is [deep ocean mineralisation](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/srccs_chapter6-1.pdf): long term chemical stability, no land use conflict, imune to geological or climate variation, zero biosphere impact.

5913,"Indeed. When looking for a car almost two years ago I took a glance at various options and ultimately decided that small petrol city car bought used (5 year old Toyota Yaris III with 1.0 engine) is not only one of the cheapest options in the long run, it's *also* option with one of the lowest total carbon footprints. Especially in Poland with still relatively dirty electricity production. That said in those two years since then prices of used electric cars came down to where they look surprisingly comparable in total ownership costs as long as you actually drive a decent amount. Without any subsidies. New cars have similar relationship and if the trend is maintained - literally in 2-3 years buying anything other than electric will be outright stupid even purely from money perspective.

I've glanced at a number of plug-in hybrids and to me they seem like pretty dumb option. In theory they should allow you to merge the benefits of BEV in city driving with range of ICE. But in practice they cost about as much as current state of art BEVs which have very good range and to the boot they are much more complicated since they effectively need 2 drivetrains (i.e. more expensive to maintain). Battery of a PHEV will also degrade faster due to far deeper cycles it goes through. Though I guess long term viability is not that much of a concern for a person who buys a new car every 3-5 years.

I also share your sentiment about people buying SUVs. I just cannot fathom how spending *that* much money for a fashion statement has become normalised. And SUVs are largely just a fashion statement since main practical difference in their real world usage from a kombi(station wagon) or van with similar amount of space is just the looks.

While I agree they are not incompatible, the french republic, due to its history with french monarchies, has tried its best to stay away from using symbols of the monarchy. 

For example the king's cake tradition, in which you eat a cake and the one that finds a little figurine in his slice gets crowned king, does still happen at the presidency every year, but there are no little figurine so that nobody gets crowned a king. 

The french republic stays as far away as it can from the monarchy's heritage.

To stay in the example of Napoleon, it almost always refer to him as ""general/consul Bonaparte"" but never as the emperor. And they will never commemorate officially anything related to those monarchies.

The third R√©publique, after getting a majority of Republicans in its chambers in the 1880's did it's best to destroy all symbols of the monarchy, selling the gems of the crown (tens of thousands of gems and crowns), destroying the palace of the tuilerie, banning royal families, removing the title of ""Marshal"" (which was later re-introduced in WWI etc...

Now, don't get me wrong, there's no need to go back to the times when the birth rate was 10 children per woman, but the current levels are also unsustainable in the long run.

Where did I say that the president needs to live in their house? I said that they don't own the house. For me yes, presidents aren't better than other citizens and should not be given free housing. But that is a different question. In most republics (and in countries where the PM gets a house) the president is allowed to live in a government house but she/he doesn't own it. Or do you think that Trump owned the white house?

&gt;Is that really better than the monarchy in terms of cultural soft power? What is the actual benefit to this person being elected democratically?
