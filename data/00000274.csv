Are you in a good place mentally? Or perhaps you have no idea what xenophobia means. Protip: if you say something  like ""ewww i hate this cultural tradition we're importing from x, I like the idea but it's just not our thing"", you're probably a bit xenophobic.

What you're suggesting is childish, like when kids simply flail their arms around and move towards somebody while insisting that you're they're not trying to hit them, and that it's the other kid's responsibility to move.

270,"like i said, he was a weird guy. but most muslims i know have quite weird views on life or religion. and everyone of them seems to have his own special way. 

things i have heard from muslims:

- ""its not ok to drink alkohol but when you do you have to hold the bottle under the table so allah won't see it""

- ""this is pork!"" - ""not, this is poultry, look at the packing.."" - ""shut up, you know nothing!"" *throws the meat away*

- ""afghanistan is way better than germany. germany is shit"" - ""then why did you come?"" - ""because people in afghanistan werent nice and the police beat me up""  .... yeah must have been a nice country. 

-  ""this is not in the koran! the prophet never said this! i have read the whole koran and never seen this!"" - i showed him the line of text - ""yeah ok but the prophet doesnt mean it the way he write it"".


I kinda stopped arguing with muslims over religion or oersonal beliefs, which is hard, because my work makes me have to talk to them. and sometimes reason and logic is far away from them. 

even doing some catering with them is stressfull. 

other than that, most of them are ok.

Green Party politicians Ákos Hadházy and party leader Bernadett Széll has won the right to visit the sorting centers for the [anti-Soros national consultation](https://www.ft.com/content/76ce19e4-a768-11e7-93c5-648314d2c72c) and were granted 90 minutes to visit all 3, dotted around Budapest. 

In the first screening center, where mail is X-rayed for explosives and other unwanted material, they could not produce a daily ledger, showing the number of daily recorded incoming envelopes. 

In the second, sorting center, where the questionnaire and the recipient's address form is sorted there was a ledger, but it was not shown to them. They said it's kept under lock and are prohibited from showing them. When informed about having a court order, the story switched to no ledger. 

In the third digital processing center had no ledger, but a local director has said they've received 400 thousand forms until November 13. On November 14, the state secretary for the Cabinet Office of the Prime Minister, responsible for the national consultation has reported 1.1 million forms received so far. 

The discrepancy can be explained by the consultation available online. However the form has zero verification, anyone can type in any names, e-mail addresses, formatting is not checked for e-mails, etc. This was uncovered in the first day of it being public. The reponse of the overseeing minister was: 'We are aware of the issue, however we hope it will not be abused' and proceeded not to make any alterations to the digital questionnaire. 

It was in this center where an official government photographer has appeared and took a picture of the politicians, who were banned from taking their own. 

Image description in pro-gov't origo.hu: 'Bernadett Széll and Ákos Hadházy on the photograph published by [official gov't site] kormany.hu. In the background you can see the boxes used for collecting forms from the national consultation, 500 each. Yet the president of [the green party] has said the whole consultation is a fake, without a single registry book or even a sole sheet'

The politicians have said that in their estimation, the government could've received back around 900k forms as opposed to the officially reported 1.7m and have seen grave forms of mishandling where additional forms could've been inserted into the pile without issue. 

The national consultation has been mailed to all Hungarian voting age citizens who have not opted out from receiving it. ",He does it for free,/r/europe/comments/7fbcvg/hungarian_opposition_politicians_gain_permit_to/dqap55g/,vernazza,1511568193

389,"There were no alliance. 700 OUN members served in 2 Wermacht batalions in 1941. All political contacts with Germans were through Abver. OUN desperately tried to contact Nazist party or SS and make a deal that Slovaks did. They failed. Germans thought they were too weak and unimportant, and they were quite right. All OUN managed to bargain was these 700 Ukrainians and that was Wermacht, not SS. Then June, in a week Germans capture Lviv and OUN-b immediately proclaimes Ukraine as an independent state. Of course they meant to be German puppets like Slovakia, but Germans denied it again and immediately disarmed/arrested/whatever these 700 solgiers. Since then OUN saw no difference between Germans, Russians, and Poles. Tactically they collaborated with all of them, mainly by exchanging intelligence.

No doubt Hitler never knew who Bandera is, take apart ""betraying"" him.

OUN was not designed with a specific purpose of exterminating Poles. There were no such plans at least until (that's my improvisation here, I'm not in a total command of details) 1941 (OUN was found in 1930 iirc). They were discussions on Poles and Jews before that - the same way plans about reintegrating Donbass are discussed today. More like daydreaming. Among these discussions were proposals which might be described as ""fascist"" but there was nothing similar to a consensus. Describing OUN as people who corralled in 1930 with the sole intention of ethnic cleansing is totally wrong. As for 1943, the consensus among non ukr/pol historians is that genocide was ordered by local UPA commanders. Personally I have no doubt that general command knew what's going on. It's like Holocaust where we have exactly 0 proofs that Hitler ordered it but it's hard to imagine that the whole thing could be done without his knowledge.

Still, the idea of OUN was totally like the idea of AK.

No one denies that Poles were among the less collaborative and most anti-Nazi. But war is a bitch. AK got weapons from Nazi, Dmowski wrote the same shit as Dontsov (I've never read Dmowski but I don't think there would be any substantial difference).

In a sence I understand Russians who are outraged with Holodomor spinning. They are not denying numbers nor motivation, they are pretty hard on communists themselves (when Europeans don't hear them). They despice pretty assholic politization of a huge crime/tragedy. Not like Russians are not acting like assholes themself on every single issue when they are ""good guys"", but still, because of ""moral imperative"" they are correct. OUN/AK shitstorms in a moral sence are more or less the same.

Another unrelated idea: when I'm thinking when Ukrainians and Russians could become friends my best guess is ""decades after Crimea return"". But when I'm looking at the level of Poland overreaction 75 years since I'm starting to think that ""centuries"" is a more realistic guess.",,/r/europe/comments/7erxv2/poland_used_pieces_of_ukrainian_memorial_to_pave/dqaqchb/,jsislsrt,1511569825

405,"Let's start with the fact that he was anti-communist activist in Solidarity, along with his twin brother who died in a plane crush in Russia. He had (and probably has) a very tight ties with the Polish inteligentia forces who defected from the communists. He always believed (or knew) that in 1993 foreign inteligentia took over power in Poland. Walensa canceled the parliament in 1993, as a result of ""lustration"" (act exposing the communist agents), because he was an communist agent. Kaczynki's party was the only one that had no communist agents in 1993, it was called ""Centrum"". Okay, that's basically his 90s background.

He designed president Duda who vetoed 2/3 reforms. 2 were unconstitutional. He most likely designed the reforms just for the president to veto them. There are reasons for that 1) As I said discreediting he's most dangerous competitors and the government, so he has a real good reason to change them.
2) Agreeing with EU
3) Tuning dow the opposition
See for yourself, the 1 of 3 were constitutional. EU commision won't prove anything.

Many Polish politicians were exposed for their corruption, and lavish life, because of easy to hide things, expensive watches, going to parties, going on expensive trips, bahamas etc. He lives humbel, no watches, no expensive holidays (always in Poland), no big villas. Nothing on him.

Why is he probably gay? He never had wife, never publically with a women, NEVER, never talking on issues of gay marriage etc. That's most likely. There is no single girls who, would say ""yeah I've been with him in high school/uni. On the other hand we know of his friendships"" with man. He can play this card anytime.

Hope I helped. Some of I wrote is my opinions, but I'am not alone. Many things I wrote is facts, like that Walensa was an agent- it's known to the Polish public.

Analysis offered by user Pletterpet 


So, I'm writing an essay on the actions and reactions of the west during the Crimea occupation and the following separatist movement in Ukraine. What I figured out so far is that the US will not intervene because they do not see Ukraine as something of core interest, and Russia does. Obama 's theorie is that Russia will have the power to escalate and he was not prepared for a war in Ukraine. Frankly, Obama didn't see the Russians as a threat to the US, his priority was China.
And because EU was so long dependent on US military they didn't have the power to do anything about it. Too late the EU realised that USA (under obama) doesn't care about (non nato) eastern Europe and Russia. He saw it as EU'S responsibility, and rightly so.

603,"We have universally binding collective agreements in Finland. These collective agreements are binding in their respective sectors also on unaffiliated employers, i.e. employers that do not belong to an employers’ organisation. Almost all workers in Finland are covered by these universally binding collective agreements.

From the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/web/en/employment-relationship/collective-agreement):

&gt; A collective agreement may be confirmed as universally binding by the Board for the Ratification of Validity of Collective Agreements. Universally binding collective agreements are binding in their respective sectors also on unaffiliated employers, i.e. employers that do not belong to an employers’ organisation. Any clause in an employment contract that violates the corresponding provision in a universally binding collective agreement is null and void.

&gt; In Finland there are about 160 universally binding collective agreements. The exact amount may vary slightly. When an employer wants to know which universally binding collective agreement he/she shall apply, the answer depends usually on the sector (industry) where the employer company operates in. An employer company’s sector is being compared to the scope of a universally binding collective agreement. Labour inspectorates and social partners can help to find the right collective agreement.

From [Service Union United PAM](https://www.pam.fi/en/about-pam.html):

&gt; Service Union United PAM is a trade union for people working in private service sectors. PAM has about 230,000 members and 76% of them are women. The majority of PAM’s members work in retail trade, property services, security services as well as tourism, restaurant and leisure services. PAM negotiates collective agreements for service sectors and safeguards its members’ interests at workplaces.

&gt; Union membership rates

&gt; 1.    Commerce: about 65%

Agreed, sorry for the derail.

&gt;That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be the ones entrusted of paternity. If someone is too weak to walk that doesn't change the fact that normal behaviour and skillset of humanity is set for long distance jogging.

Maybe 10.000 years ago, but that ""normal"" no longer applies to the chair sitters of modernity,  nor do we expect it of people any more than we expect them to be sprinters, lifters or swimmers. 

We have to accept that we can not take biology as anything we can build concepts on. Human are inherently social and technological with biology quickly sliding into irrelevance.

&gt;A man is man because his sex and his role, those two are unseperatable, because they are evolutionary output from the psyche to the actual organs, and religious symbols represent this. This is obvioulsy not that easy on social level but that is not the current topic.

I think it has a lot to do with the current topic, because we're discussing attributed gender on an agenderless being. If the being is agender, if such a being is capable of existing, then the role itself is agendered by default.

And since sex is incapable of defining much besides the mechanics of procreation and heredity, and cannot say anything much of the individual than expected hormonal effects, how can we trust sex to provide clear role attribute unless the role is tied to those fleshy, mechanical and hormonal effects.

It's a paradox: If God is a ""he"", either role is genderless or god has sexual organs. One is not a mainstream belief, the other is something which might quickly verge on heresy.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7f7r9h/church_of_sweden_to_stop_referring_to_god_as_he/dqa86ps/,anarchotech,1511546564

657,"Probably.

Not being an economist, I'm limited to conjectures here. I hower hope it is reasonable to posist what follows.

The devil here lies in the small detail that is the definition of *better*, for which no scientific consensus seems to exist.

If your goal is to mesure the evolution of the GNP, then GNP is your best indicator. Sorry for the tautology, but I find that underlying tautologies is a no-nonsense exercise when questioning economics.

GDP has its advantages I suppose, starting by the fact that it is well known and well established. Part of its appeal is also the modicum of scientifc varnish it offers, being based on hard verifiable public data.

Here comes a train of other devilish details. The biggest is, I'd guess, something of an epistemological nature. Since inception, the academic discipline of economics struggled to be accepted on par with hard sciences. Many natural scientists seem to cast economics in the same non descript box with fuzzy humanities such as philosophy, litterature, underwater basket weaving or sociology. Which, imho opinion, is a great injustice to said disciplines as well as a great loss for hard sciences, as well as a tragic ignorance of the history of science, from Eratosthene to Steven Hawkings via Descartes, Pascal, Lavoisier and of course Leonardo and Michelangelo, but I digress.

Now tremble before the mighty bandwagon of politics, its sidekick the sad clown ""The Press"", the squad of special interests disguised as cheerleaders and the disaccorded fanfares of ""My-God-Is-Better"" fanatics. And don't forget unions. Unions are big players in the field of political economy.

Finally, what of economics trickles down to the rest of us often amounts, upon closer inspedtion, to layered heaps of rehashed crap. Hence the collective hypnosis fixated on the GDP and its growth.

The HDI seems open for debates as it is a composite index and I'd suppose that not every scholar aggrees as to the pertinence of such or such component.

Illegaly remove a sitting president and deny the right of millions Ukrainians to be represented because ""protests"". Very weak argument.

Maidan destabilized Ukraine. They could and should've waited that one god damn year and then elect a new president and without any problems sign whatever deals they wanted. **ONE YEAR.**

Instead, they have chosen to deny the right of millions Ukrainians to be represednted and illegaly overthrown Yanukovich without lawful procedures.

763,"&gt; lenin and stalin brought so much destruction and humiliation to their country and yet they get glorified.

To be fair - my personal perspective - but I understand them. Russia isn't exactly a rich country and realistically it will not be for a long time (wealth accrues over time, you just don't wake up in a gilded nation). So they're poor now, they were poor then. 

Democracy is also extremely tricky. Much like the Russians (and Romanians) we Bulgarians live in what could be classified as a Mafia State, I cannot put into words how demoralizing this is. It puts the argument of ""dysfunctional democracy vs benevolent monarch"" into a whole new light. 

So you, before they were poor, now they're poor, before they lived in an olygarchic state, now they live in an olygarchic state. Before they were respected on the words stage, now they're the but of a joke (if it wasn't for Putin scaring the bejeezus out of everyone, even more so). Lenin and Stalin at least built a superpower (historically to them goes the credit). 

It is counter-productive, but it is understandable.

783,"A traditional craft that is said to date back to Saint Francis of Assisi’s commissioning of a Nativity scene in the 13th century, Naples elevated this craft into high art. By the 18th century, thanks in part to the patronage of King Charles the III, the art of the presepio was in its golden age. The traditional life sized wooden religious Nativity scenes that were crafted for the church had evolved into animated, detailed and expressive miniature terracotta figurines in an art form that blended sculpting, painting, fashion, and tailoring. In true Baroque fashion, the sacred and the profane collided, setting the Holy Family and the procession of the Magi alongside vignettes that portrayed contemporary life in 18th century Naples. Scenes that depicted ordinary people going about their ordinary lives: shoemakers and innkeepers, bakers and fruit vendors, fishmongers and butchers, carpenters and blacksmiths, and the beggars, the poor and the derelict.

These intricate scenes soon found their way into the homes of the royalty, nobility, and the wealthy bourgeoisie. Today, the Neapolitan Presepio or Presepe, o’Presebbio in dialect, is probably Naples most widely known Christmas tradition.

In centuries old workshops and artist studios in Naples, master and apprentice artisans still sculpt these intricate figurines in terracotta and wood. Rarely the work of one artist, the hands, feet, or limbs may be entrusted to an apprentice, while sculpting of the faces will be the work of a master. The pieces are colored by expert painters and attached to a body made of iron wire and a thick hemp wick. Hand blown glass eyes and costumes made of fine fabrics finish the pieces. The figurines are then placed in and around mangers or “caves” that are typically made of natural materials or in elaborate city or country landscape settings. Today’s presepio might also include lights and water and mechanical features and today’s figurines include everything from traditional 18th century figures to contemporary figures on the national and [international stage](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2718/4132978615_6d449f5170_b.jpg) (here an example from the early 2010s with a statue of Obama)

Most of the Neapolitan workshops are clustered along the ancient alley Via San Gregorio Armeno where you can find these masterpieces alongside mass-produced items made of plastic, wax or poor quality ceramic.

&gt; Tier 1 cities in China are wealthy and prosperous on 'par' with West already, with total population over 100 million, India lacks such wealthy cities (as far as I know).

Are they? This seems more like a matter of perception than facts, because I don't know what a ""Tier 1 city"" is supposed to be. Several Indian cities do have GDPs the size of the smaller European countries. In China, all foreigners see are large coastal cities. You see the real state of the country in the rural areas. Though to be honest, even in Shanghai you can find slums, they're just well-hidden.

&gt; Many people also consider India to be really filthy, rivers and streets polluted with both human and industrial waste (thrash in case of the streets).

Literally it's exactly the same in China, which is the world's biggest polluter. So many rivers in China are so polluted as to be completely unfit for human use.

Again, this is all a matter of perception and stereotypes. India is stereotyped as a poor and filthy country, while China has managed to rewrite how it's perceived to be seen as rich and powerful, and their government plays up this perception for all it's worth - until someone points out China's massive pollution contribution. Then suddenly the Chinese government is claiming that they're still a third world country so they should be allowed to pollute more, that they need to be given more time to develop, that Europe polluted the world more first, etc. Trying to have their cake and eat it too.

932,"The exact character of the boom depends on the geometry of you, the flight path, and what's on the ground - obviously anywhere directly underneath the flight path while the aircraft is supersonic gets the proper ""crack"" as the compression wave touches down (i.e. they hear the boom directly pass over them on its' way outwards from the flight path). People some distance from it (like you ashore, and thus a little way before the supersonic phase begins) hear a collection of interrelated sounds: the direct boom (although further attenuated by the extra cosine distance) and reflections and diffusions of the boom from the ground. These don't arrive in quite the order you'd think, either, as the density of air substantially affects the speed of sound: at Concorde cruise altitude (~60k ft) Mach 1 is around 15% slower - which means the ground reflection, dulled by interacting with trees and buildings (or the surface of the sea, which is an acoustically complex entity in its' own right) can partly arrive before the direct sound, if you're a sufficient distance away - as a very approximate measure, if the angle between the ground and the plane from your viewing position is more than 60 degrees, you'll be hearing ground effects first. There's also the inverse square law to consider: a linear increase in distance between you and the plane results in the boom as it hits you having to be larger with the square of the distance (because it's a big circle radiating out) - which again reduces the peak loudness. 

A practical example, though: when you're reasonably far away from lightning, you get rolls of thunder that properly rumble and don't have a distinct ""bang"" - despite thunder being exactly one compression shockwave with no extra following sounds at all. When you're close to the lightning, though, you get a very distinct ""crack"" and then some reverberations (if you're in the right environment for reverberation). 

In short: the noise abatement procedures for Concorde were very effective and reduced the disruption caused by going supersonic at low altitude and over land, enormously, which allowed it to have a reasonable relationship with the general public. If they *hadn't* adopted noise abatement procedures, then it would have been noisier (due to size; boom energy is roughly linear with volume of aeroplane assuming no special noise-reduction features) than QRA fighters going supersonic at low level, and those are loud enough that the MoD gets complaints every time it happens. That would have almost certainly turned both the British and American public against supersonic jets entirely, especially when it would have been a case of ""ordinary working people"" suffering the negative impacts of booms, so that ""the jet set"" could fly in style. The working class will put up with broken windows to avoid Soviet bombers; not so much so Sofia Loren can nip over and do two 10pm interviews in one night.

1226,"Estwhile the center of the Universe, Europe attempted suicide twice in the twentieth century. The devastations were sever. When peace and sanity finally prevailed, everything was in short supply.

And by ""short supply"" I could as well say ""no supply"". Factories had been bombed to the ground. Surviving railways had no usable rolling stock. Millions of able-bodied men had died or been maimed. There were famines in Holland. The average European kid was a malnourish orphan dressed in rags. The task at hand was simply to rebuild a whole continent from the ground up, while simultaneously exorcising ancient demons.

It was a bold plan. It needed success. It needed to show its usefulness. Every tonne of coal extracted meant another familly wouldn't freeze to death this winter. Every shirt out off the loom meant a naked man got clothed. And babies, babies everywhere. Every penny spent by the state filled a gap. Material progess *was* progress, period, no question asked. 

Then, Europe gradually moved out of scarcity through the 60s and the 70s. Western Europe that is. But then, the dogma had already cemented that GDP means happiness, even though is was becoming increasingly clear that productivity is not the only measure of prosperity. Meanwhile, the Cold-War was still red-hot. Many European countries had historically strong Communist or Socialist parties which posed a (debatable) threat to the stability of those democracies (that were also America's bitches). The factual observation that Eastern industrial output was inferior was seen by many as an argument valid enough to demonstrate that socialism isn't desirable and that the continuation of conservative policies was a prerequisite for lasting peace, almost no questions asked. The importance of civic liberties had not yet completely permeated the collective European mind.

1992, Europe is reunited, all rejoice, another reconstruction, quite a few walls were torn down besides Berlin, and yet again productivity became temporarily convenient shorthand for happiness, also many dissenting questions were raised, from western spoiled brats aspiring to more liberties but also from some people in the East, left on the side of the road by the sudden shift to market economy.

Meanwhile in China, a dragon awakes.

Meanwhile in climatology labs, alerts start blinking.

1268,"&gt; [In solidarity with Library Genesis and Sci-Hub](http://custodians.online/)

In Antoine de Saint Exupéry's tale the Little Prince meets a businessman who accumulates stars with the sole purpose of being able to buy more stars. The Little Prince is perplexed. He owns only a flower, which he waters every day. Three volcanoes, which he cleans every week. ""It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them,"" he says, ""but you are of no use to the stars that you own"".

There are many businessmen who own knowledge today. Consider Elsevier, the largest scholarly publisher, whose 37% profit margin1 stands in sharp contrast to the rising fees, expanding student loan debt and poverty-level wages for adjunct faculty. Elsevier owns some of the largest databases of academic material, which are licensed at prices so scandalously high that even Harvard, the richest university of the global north, has complained that it cannot afford them any longer. Robert Darnton, the past director of Harvard Library, says ""We faculty do the research, write the papers, referee papers by other researchers, serve on editorial boards, all of it for free … and then we buy back the results of our labour at outrageous prices.""2 For all the work supported by public money benefiting scholarly publishers, particularly the peer review that grounds their legitimacy, journal articles are priced such that they prohibit access to science to many academics - and all non-academics - across the world, and render it a token of privilege.3

Elsevier has recently filed a copyright infringement suit in New York against Science Hub and Library Genesis claiming millions of dollars in damages.4 This has come as a big blow, not just to the administrators of the websites but also to thousands of researchers around the world for whom these sites are the only viable source of academic materials. The social media, mailing lists and IRC channels have been filled with their distress messages, desperately seeking articles and publications.

Even as the New York District Court was delivering its injunction, news came of the entire editorial board of highly-esteemed journal Lingua handing in their collective resignation, citing as their reason the refusal by Elsevier to go open access and give up on the high fees it charges to authors and their academic institutions. As we write these lines, a petition is doing the rounds demanding that Taylor &amp; Francis doesn't shut down Ashgate5, a formerly independent humanities publisher that it acquired earlier in 2015. It is threatened to go the way of other small publishers that are being rolled over by the growing monopoly and concentration in the publishing market. These are just some of the signs that the system is broken. It devalues us, authors, editors and readers alike. It parasites on our labor, it thwarts our service to the public, it denies us access6.

We have the means and methods to make knowledge accessible to everyone, with no economic barrier to access and at a much lower cost to society. But closed access’s monopoly over academic publishing, its spectacular profits and its central role in the allocation of academic prestige trump the public interest. Commercial publishers effectively impede open access, criminalize us, prosecute our heroes and heroines, and destroy our libraries, again and again. Before Science Hub and Library Genesis there was Library.nu or Gigapedia; before Gigapedia there was textz.com; before textz.com there was little; and before there was little there was nothing. That's what they want: to reduce most of us back to nothing. And they have the full support of the courts and law to do exactly that.7

In Elsevier's case against Sci-Hub and Library Genesis, the judge said: ""simply making copyrighted content available for free via a foreign website, disserves the public interest""8. Alexandra Elbakyan's original plea put the stakes much higher: ""If Elsevier manages to shut down our projects or force them into the darknet, that will demonstrate an important idea: that the public does not have the right to knowledge.""

We demonstrate daily, and on a massive scale, that the system is broken. We share our writing secretly behind the backs of our publishers, circumvent paywalls to access articles and publications, digitize and upload books to libraries. This is the other side of 37% profit margins: our knowledge commons grows in the fault lines of a broken system. We are all custodians of knowledge, custodians of the same infrastructures that we depend on for producing knowledge, custodians of our fertile but fragile commons. To be a custodian is, de facto, to download, to share, to read, to write, to review, to edit, to digitize, to archive, to maintain libraries, to make them accessible. It is to be of use to, not to make property of, our knowledge commons.

More than seven years ago Aaron Swartz, who spared no risk in standing up for what we here urge you to stand up for too, wrote: ""We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access. With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?""9

We find ourselves at a decisive moment. This is the time to recognize that the very existence of our massive knowledge commons is an act of collective civil disobedience. It is the time to emerge from hiding and put our names behind this act of resistance. You may feel isolated, but there are many of us. The anger, desperation and fear of losing our library infrastructures, voiced across the internet, tell us that. This is the time for us custodians, being dogs, humans or cyborgs, with our names, nicknames and pseudonyms, to raise our voices.

Share this letter - read it in public - leave it in the printer. Share your writing - digitize a book - upload your files. Don't let our knowledge be crushed. Care for the libraries - care for the metadata - care for the backup. Water the flowers - clean the volcanoes.

With 10 2m^3 stacks of 10TB HDD's transfer speed via concorde is 0.026Pb/s or 26.89Tb/s

The fastest transatlantic cable is Googles 'FASTER' boasting 60Tb/s

Facebooks 'MAREA is planned for service by Q1 2018 and is capable of speeds up to 160Tb/s. From my short amount research each cable pretty much doubles in strength with each new cable laid.
Assuming this is true, we can do some pretty dodgy maths: add the top 2 speeds and multiply by 1.2 to get the total speed possible (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)
We get 264Tb/s or being generous we can round it to 300Tb/s.

In order to achieve that speed via concorde, you would need 3691.4Pb, or 110 stacks. This would come at a cost of $1.3512bil, and would weigh 520520lbs or 236104kg.

A tour operator primarily targeting Italian and Spanish travelers offering *""Moscow &amp; St. Petersburg, [...] Baltic States, [...] Other tours in Russia""*

I hope that the tour guide will not just focus on old buildings and *traditional* restaurants but will also give at least some context about the region. Because that's the only way given that not even basic education regarding geopolitics to the east of Berlin wall exists in most WE countries, especially Romance speaking ones. I know it's not the case in this sub but many in their early to mid 20's see East bloc as a single entity (Budapest and Prague being notable exceptions since at least one of them was visited during a school trip 10 years ago). Of course some are considerably better informed than others and can make some distinctions around here like my Italian colleague who recently learned the news from me that Latvia has joined EU (it happened when he was 11) or my Master educated ex from France who was quite surprised to hear that Ukraine isn't part of EU and when asked if she heard anything about Crimean war during last 3 years replied with *""Yeah, it's bad..""* After countless conversations with folk like that, I began to think that school curriculum there is simply ignoring half of the continent.

1537,"No, it actually went in reverse from how you described. What is nowadays the masculine form in Indo-European languages _used_ to be the fully neutral form. You see that all the time, in Old English ""man"" just meant ""human"" and could also be applied to female persons easily. The precursor of ""he"" could also be applied to female persons.

Old English had three words ""mann"" which meant human being ""wermann"" which meant specifically male human being and ""wifmann"" which meant specifically female human being. ""wifmann"" is what eventually evolved to ""woman"" and the wif- prefix is still visible in ""wife"" but not in many other places. The sexism you spoke of worked in the opposite direction. People started to specifically note female human beings so often that the absence of noting it specifically began to imply maleness because people always felt they needed to explicitly note that a human being was female not noting it implied the opposite after a while so ""mann"" started to more and more refer to male human beings explicitly and as a consequence ""wermann"" was no longer needed and died out and ""wifmann"" evolved into ""woman"".

This is still to this day why in many Indo-European languages the feminine form has a suffix attached to the masculine form. Because the Masculine form was originally gender neutral. Like Dutch has two words for ""friend"", ""vriend"" and ""vriendin"", the latter being feminine and the former being ""sort of masculine but not really but I guess it kind of is"". In Middle-Dutch the word ""vrient"" whence it comes was just gender neutral like in English. But due to these origins when you refer to a female-only group of friends you'd still typically use the ""masculine"" plural; you can use the feminine plural to do so but it sounds like you're talking more about their gender than about their status as your friends. Even though using the ""masculine"" form without qualifier on a female person sounds kind of strange and without any qualifier it just refers to a male friend but for isntance you can say ""vrouwelijke vriend"" just fine which means ""female friend"" if you want and ""vrouwelijke vriendin"" sounds like a weird pleonasm. ""mannelijke vriend"" for ""male friend"" also sounds fine and doesn't sound like a pleonasm but ""mannelijke vriendin"" sounds as paradoxical and weir das ""male female friend"" in English does. So even though ""vrient"" in middle Dutch was just gender-neutral the word today has a very masculine slant to it but it's not symmetric in the slightest and it still has some gender-neutral application.",,/r/europe/comments/7eym75/no_more_middots_french_pm_clamps_down_on/dq98ujj/,cromulently_so,1511482208

1846,"&gt; This pattern of antisocial behaviour by profit shifting hubs such as these is estimated to impose global revenue losses of around $500 billion each year – with disproportionately high costs for lower-income countries where revenues are most badly needed. The benefits, meanwhile, are many times smaller. **While the shifted profits might have been taxed at 20-30%, the procuring jurisdictions receive a tiny fraction of that.**

&gt; **For jurisdictions with smaller populations, and no concern for the damage they do to others, that tiny fraction may be worthwhile. For a larger country like the UK, starting from far behind these others in the race to the bottom, the calculation simply couldn’t add up.** All the revenue given up since 2010 in cutting the rate to 19% would be eclipsed by the further losses needed to take the effective rate down far enough to compete for profit shifting. Any gains, from a near-zero percentage of shifted profits, just wouldn’t come close.

&gt; Ultimately, the EU can restrict market access if the UK fails to meet international standards in respect of tax and transparency

The report further determined that Bosnian Croat forces had also carried out policies of ethnic cleansing targeted principally at Muslims, but also Bosnian Serb populations, but on a significantly lesser scale than the Bosnian Serbs and their allies.** Finally, it found while Bosnian government forces (largely Muslim) had engaged in practices that constituted grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, they had no policy of ethnic cleansing and did not carry out such operations.**",Bosnia and Herzegovina,/r/europe/comments/7esh8d/srebrenica_memorial_to_the_8372_victims_of_mladic/dq8m38s/,Adil_Zulfikarpasic,1511452902

In the Netherlands there was even quite a bit of resistance against the former Warsaw pact countries joining the EU because of the large amount of Eastern European immigrants that had come beforehand.

So was in Germany and Austria, which demanded (and got) 7-year period, during which the citizens of the new members could not work in these countries without work visas (!). Well, they do remember that and is one of arguments against immigration policies pushed by Germany, as in ""we needed visas to work while we were EU members; why should we allow non-members, who have no intent to work, to use our social system?"".

However, the point was, they *wanted to be westerners*; there was no need for any social programs to integrate them. Actually, they had to work harder.

&gt; That is not the point, the Germans emigrating to the US weren't interested in integration too. Nor were the Italians. It always takes effort.

They didn't hold the American values in contempt, but as equals. They wanted their part of American Dream. They didn't want to change the US society to fit their values, they changed themselves to fit. Melting pot and so on.

1967,"Not sure that you understood what you read. The origin of the Greeks is the most important thing of determining if those tribes were Greek. By ""Greeks"" we mean the people that created what is Greece and the Greek civilization. It doesn't matter if the Minoans or the Mycenaeans originated even from Africa, they'd still be Greek tribes if they are proven to be the descendants of the people that we show as Greeks. It's not the other way around ""oh that tribe comes from Anatolia so it's not Greek"". The study shows not only that the modern Greeks have as much in common with the Minoans as with the Mycenaeans which are considered a Greek tribe, but also that these two groups were connected. Either way you look at it it points to the same conclusion, unless of course the research is shown to be bullshit.

It's not a matter of the Greeks claiming anything good. If that was the case we'd be claiming the Aztecs to be Greek too.

1984,"It's also not ""gender neutral"" language. A gender-neutral word can refer to both males and females.

In the end how French works is that by approximation there are ""gender-neutral"" and ""feminine"" words. This is similar to actor/actress in English where ""actor"" can be used for both male and female persons but ""actress"" only for female persons. Now imagine a language full of it.

It's all a continuum and matter of degrees, the French word ""acteur"" definitely _leans_ slightly more towards masculine than gender neutral but ""actrice"" leans a thousand lightyears further towards feminine. If you use the pleural ""acteurs"" to refer to a group it does not say anything about the makeup of the sexes whereas the plural ""actrices"" for a group not only implies that the entire group is female; it puts a huge amount of emphasis on that fact and almost makes the gender-makeup of the group sound more important than the profession.

2047,"You would be surprised how many more ""scientific tests"" exist to reexamine the same thing. You are a bit naive if you really think that it is easily possible for regular sick criminals to perform some sort of perfect crimes that are literally unsolvable even with evidence. 

Unsolved crimes are those where there is no suspect or where there's no body or evidence of murder or even indirect evidence of murder. There are no ""innocent guys"" in these because the crime is unsolved in the first place, it's not solved ""wrong"".

If there is a suspect and evidence is examined thoroughly, then it's extremely rare to select a wrong suspect, to sentence an ""innocent"" guy, because there's so many slip ups even the smartest criminals can make that it's more likely for them to make one then for the justice system to sentence an ""innocent"" person. And also to commit a crime and avoid getting caught or getting evidence pinned to you requires a lot of effort and planning, very few of the criminals sentenced to death actually do that, a lot of them are dumb as a brick.

But if you want to blame ""racist bias"", investigators not doing their job or outright sabotaging it, or even the laughable practice of putting on a show for a jury of random people of which like a half doesn't even want to be there and the other one just wants to see some thrilling courtroom show which has very little to do with actual justice, then it's putting the blame on the justice system being rotten and corrupted in its very core and not on the death sentence being at fault here.

2142,"&gt; The internet is already “biased” by much more impactful factors than zero ratings. Advertisers come to mind as a major one, who provide significant financial incentive to provide or more importantly not provide certain content. 

Then why make it worse?
 
&gt;Also, a point could be made that in a mobile environment zero caps are a good thing. Providers are stuck competing with each other

And they use their bottom line as a touchstone for that competition, so getting money for zero ratings  will encourage them to do so.

&gt;Providers are stuck competing with each other, so they can’t use them to boost services owned by then while leaving others behind, granting them an unfair competitive advantage, since consumers are free to pick a service of their choosing and will simply pick one that offers a more comprehensive package.

People will blame the website rather than the ISP. How can you tell the difference between slow servers and a throttled network?

2155,"The criteria:

...survey questions:

1. must be simple and understandable;

2. must be non-hypothetical;

3. must require only knowledge that respondents actually have;

4. must avoid double stimuli;

5. must avoid unclear terminology;

6. must avoid inexact time references;

7. with multiple items must have both negative and positive response options;

8. must avoid insinuation and leading questions;

9. must have response options that are balanced, logically complete, and free of overlap;

10. must avoid contextual effects.

Some key parts:

&gt;One example is the frequently posed question about respondents’ trust in EU institutions. Perhaps widespread knowledge can be assumed among respondents on the structure and responsibilities of the Council, the European Parliament, and the Commission (though we have serious doubts with regard to the Commission). However, questions on trust also include the European Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the European Ombudsman. Respondents regularly answer “no” when asked whether they have ever heard of or read about such institutions, but are nevertheless required to state whether they “tend to trust” or “tend not to trust” them (most recently in EB 73).

&gt;Hypothetical items such as “To reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990” overburden the cognitive abilities of respondents. Who can evaluate whether such goals are “too ambitious,” “about right,” or “too modest”? There is a high risk here that respondents will tend to give socially desirable answers rather than actual estimates.

&gt;Respondents have a tendency to answer many questions with “I agree” or “yes,” regardless of the question’s content, a problem referred to as “acquiescence” (Iarossi 2006: 44–45). Therefore, by using only positively or negatively formulated choices, a survey can steer results in a desired direction. (...) Questions requiring “tend to agree” or “tend to disagree” responses appear frequently in Eurobarometer surveys. Close examination, however, reveals that the choices provided on EU topics sometimes veer persistently in a positive direction. (...) Note in particular that items such as “[our country’s] voice counts in the EU” and “the interests of [our country] are well taken into account in the EU” are logically close-by, a situation in which inverse orientation of one of the statements would be clearly appropriate. Such a negatively poled statement was provided for the first time in spring 2008 in the form of “the European Union imposes its views on [our country]” (see the last bullet point in Table 4). It immediately received the highest level of agreement and was removed just two surveys later. (...) It is clearly evident here that the Commission is targeting “integrationist” results while suppressing “Eurosceptical” ones. 

&gt;As early as Survey 48.0 (Q37), rule 7 was being faithfully upheld, with respondents being asked negatively-oriented statements as well, such as “the more unemployment there will be in …”. However, this approach was suspended in 2001 just as the Commission was carrying out a special survey dealing with the EU’s eastward enlargement. Positively oriented statements were now in the majority and statements that had previously been negative now appeared in inverse formulations. Respondents were now being asked to rate statements such as “Enlargement will help to create more jobs.” Although the results obtained here certainly remained unsatisfactory from the Commission’s viewpoint, the Commission could henceforth avoid negative messages such as “Fifty percent of Germans expect unemployment to increase.” Instead, the reported result was positive and one-sided: “20 percent [agree] that it would create more jobs” (EB 2001: 3).

&gt;Respondents are, in effect, being presented with a fait accompli, with a choice of only three different time schedules for eastward enlargement. Opposition to enlargement was registered only when respondents revealed it voluntarily and indeed a remarkable 50 percent did so (EB 1995); we can only speculate on the outcome had the respondents been presented with a methodologically clean question. 

&gt;At first glance, the way the question is formulated and the available response options appear to be fair. However, closer examination reveals that this is not so: two of the three
optional responses are geared toward support, while only one implies disapproval. The number and order of the options suggest the presence of a neutral option, which in fact does not exist. A respondent who selects the apparently neutral option signals approval of EMU (“is … necessary”) rather than indifference. 

&gt;Q12 requires the interviewer to read out a list of EU accomplishments to respondents who are then asked to select the two best. Let us ignore the peculiar construction of Q12 which presumes the success of the EU actions and leaves no room for respondents who may not share the presumption. Instead, let us direct our attention to a violation of the tenth rule: Q12 actively gives a positive stance toward European politics. Therefore, a contextual effect on Q13 and Q14 may occur.

A. We're doing classic social democracy by expansive tax politics

B. We're not doing that, because we're realistic and need to take responsibility for the economy

I'm not saying any of them are *lies*, but depending on when you play which card, you can successfully keep your voters happy, while not making your opponents hate you.

 I think the Swedish right is split through the middle between the sensible part that believe his government are a political opponent - albeit a reasonable one. The other part thinks he's literally Hitler.

Anyway I guess my point was that at least the social democrats would phrase their political strategy as ""social democracy, but only if and when we can afford it"" – which is vague and ambiguous but seems to satisfy a big chunk of the Swedish electorate.

To be fair, that policy has been the mantra of Swedish social democracy for the last 50 years. Their offensive play is the social democracy card, their defensive play is their record of keeping the public economy in shape.

But you could argue that the Swedish economy is in such a good shape that there's room for *actual* and *offensive* progressive policy. Wages and median disposible income is rising a lot, while expenses for social programs are at historical lows.

Iñigo Pérez de Herrasti is one of those accused of the attack on the Cultural Center Blanquerna 2013 and will not have to enter prison by decision of the Constitutional Court , known as Wednesday. He probably doesn't ring a bell by his name, but Perez de Herrasti has an important criminal history and family ties with the current Minister of Education and spokesman for the Spanish government, Íñigo Méndez de Vigo , and the former Minister of Defense Pedro Morenés Eulate .

The assailant, about 60 years old and leader of National Alliance, is Morenés cousin on his mother. At the same time, it is also Mendez de Vigo brother, and his sister, María Pérez de Herrasti, is married to the minister.

Between criminal history Perez de Herrasti, has a sentence of 14 years in prison in 2000, when he was arrested along with three members of Neo Nazi groups with explosives and weapons for  attacking relatives of ETA prisoners who traveled to the capital Spanish to visit the imprisoned.

Seven years later, Perez de Herrasti made a hunger strike, accompanied by Pedro Pablo Peña, a member of National Alliance, to protest what they saw as preferential treatment to ETA prisoners.

In addition, the ultra is the son of Marquises . His father, Ramón Pérez de Herrasti and Narvaez, is the fourteenth Marquis de Albayda, and his mother, Begoña Alvarez de Eulate Urquijo and is the daughter of the Marquis of Bolarque and is part of the family of the Marquises of Urquijo.

The Second Chamber of the Constitutional Court agreed Thursday to suspend execution of the sentence of imprisonment imposed on him by the Supreme Court, along with four more ultras, who attacked violently the Blanquerna Cultural Center on September 11, 2013, as took place the official ceremony of the Diada de Catalunya in Madrid.",Basque Country,/r/europe/comments/7ez7pc/one_of_the_spanish_farright_ultras_that_stormed/dq8dz5j/,Basque_Pirate,1511438827

Why? On its own it's a non-argument: replace zero rating with a disgusting crime of your choice.

&gt;If some costumers opt for that over non-zero rating packages and some don't (like me for instance), that is a sign of the market functioning as intended and people ""voting with their wallets"". 

People will not make a conscious choice, by far the majority will pick the option that is presented as standard, and even if it's free then the no zero rating will be hidden behind a lot of technical fine print that most people don't understand, so they'll just say ""give me the standard thing"".

&gt;If it has negative effects like you predict (zero rating isn't a thing for that long) the EU will surely act and further adapt net neutrality rules to prevent zero rating.

Why clean up afterwards when you can prevent it at all?

Although having a law degree in most European countries does not make you a qualified 'lawyer'. There's usually another qualification you have to do, or a period of training.

E.g. in the UK, once you have your law degree (or once you've done your one-year postgraduate conversion having done a non-law undergraduate) then you have to do another year of study to either prepare you for the bar (to be a barrister) or to allow you to start your training period articled to a supervising lawyer (to be a solicitor).

It's still quicker than the US though. If you start at 18, then it's 3 years undergraduate, one year postgraduate, and then you start earning money while you train with your firm/chambers.

2336,"He is right, but he's not completely right either.

I'm a non-EU migrant living here in France. My visa lasts about another year. I'm not here for asylum reasons (based on a contract-studentship-scholarship situation), but once you're already here, it's much easier to stay here than any country I've ever lived in. You just have to find sponsorship for a job, or even just enrol in a university (which is the least expensive I've ever seen and doesn't even have selection for bachelors-level public universities) to be allowed to stay. All of these things make it easier for you to become a contributing member of society, which in turn makes it much easier for you to stay in France. Yes, there's a mountain of horrible paperwork, but that's France... 

I feel like this is the right way to do it. So in the case of this woman, she's not in danger in Morocco, no. But she could find sponsorship for a job or some other way of living, even just being sponsored by a relative. The state just doesn't want to pay for people to live here unless those people are in danger. That's a position I can really understand. When you migrate, you have to earn it unless you're fleeing from danger (as too many people are).",,/r/europe/comments/7exiig/macron_to_moroccan_woman_you_must_return_to_your/dq88sfm/,arrbeen_throwzor,1511424613

The laws are not the same for rich and poor, every aspect of public life is being privatised, politicians are glaringly obvious tycoon shills who don't even try to hide their corruptness. Enormous sums of public money are wasted on bullshit. Blame is thrown on anyone who is different for bullshit reasons, just to provide the dust-cover for corruption.

Above paragraph describes both USA and Croatia, but it doesn't describe all EU countries. Not the ones that are leading, anyways.

2504,"&gt; No mate. It's because there's a demand for it. If there was no demand, then there would be no reason to mine it. Just because you spend X monies making it doesn't make it worth X+Y monies. Especially true with crypto since, well, you get nothing physical back.

Yes, and because it takes so much to mine the _supply_ becomes lower thus increasing its value.

The weird state of the world is that _anything_ in low supply gains value no matter how practically useless it is, see jade again. It is just as useless as a random rock but the supply is low thus it the value increases.

&gt; Yes it is. You're not comparing 99.99 and 100%. You're comparing 100% and depending on what you're doing way way less.

Yes I am, we are comparing bitcoins to jade in the event of a bubble collapse. Bitcoins are in that case 100% wasteful power and jade is 99.9999999999% wasteful power because in the event of a collapse of jade it's just going to be rocks which you invest a fucktonne of energy in to excavate while you could just get them out of your garden.

&gt; Because a jade doesn't cost $1000 per kg to mine. It costs pennies. Demand and availability drive the price up. Not cost.

Actually the highest quality jade has a market value above gold per mass because it costs that much to obtain it.

High quality jade is indeed rare in the Earth's crust which is why it costs more because you have to excavate far more Earth to get it which makes it more expensive to do. So we have a little stone which unlike gold has no industrial application which is worth more than it just because it costs more than gold to unearth.

&gt; A $100 bill doesn't cost $99 to make it costs sub 1c. Again governments drive the price up. Not cost.

And 100 EUR in bitcoins doesn't cost that to make either. It costs that _to mine_. That 100 EUR bill you have at one point was gold excavated from the Earth which the bank took in and handed out money for in return. That money you own are worthless bits that serve as a _proof_ that you once did an amount of labour to obtain it—it's not at all that dissimilar from bitcoins.

&gt; And regardless, this is whataboutism. We're not talking about jade here. We're talking about crypto.

""whataboutism"" like most logical fallacies is a term people repeat without understanding. Like any logical fallacy whether it is fallicious depends on what you attempt to demonstrate with it. It's a fallacy to say ""Other problems exist therefore this is not a problem"" it is not a fallacy to say ""You claim you care about this principle  but this principle applies elsewhere too and you don't seem to care about the elsewhere, therefore you do not actually care about this principle""

&gt; And as long as crypto uses up coal, petrol, yada yada and provides nothing in return, then it's 100% wasteful.

So does jade mining and you seem to not care about jade mining and defend it thus demonstrating that you do not care about the principle you claim to care about above. Not only jade miing but also:

1. painting
2. art in general
3. going to an amusement park

Like I said all of those practical functions can be replicated with another material that is cheaper to unearth and produce. It is sold at a higher price than that simply because people are willing to pay more for ""real jade"" even though they wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

Okay, let's put it like this then, the number ""0"" in finance is a social construct.

0 is 10 cent less than 10 cent in the same way that 2.10 is 10 cent less from 2.20.

Numbers in finance go positive and negative all the time, 0 is not really some kind of special singularity in finance. For an investor the difference between whatever you invested in turning out literally worthless and worth 0 and worth 1 cent is really not any more meaningful than the difference between it being worth 30 billion and  it being worth 30 billion and 1 cent.

2719,"&gt; I'm trying to explain that being a Serb does not make me guilty for Srebrenica, just like being a Croat does not make him guilty for Oluja.

See, I agree with the claim that the fact you're a Serb doesn't make you guilty for Srebrenica.

But why do you have to mention Oluja in the same sentence? They're not in the same level of reality. In Srebrenica, Ratko ladić led the killing of 8000 unarmed Bosnian people. In Oluja, Croatian Army liberated 10 000 square km, with as many as 200 000 people (or more) living there. Out of that number, the ICTY assesses there were 324 civilian casualties. More than 2000 people in Croatia were sentenced for crimes committed in Oluja (mostly looting and destruction of property).

No, having the nodes verify blocks before adding them to the chain does that. 

Mining does not add any cryptological security. Mining is an intentional waste of time and processing power to limit the number of blocks added to about one per 10 minutes. There are two reasons for that, one is that blocks have to be able to propagate through the network before the next one is added, and the second is as spam/ddos protection. The scheme was originally created to [combat email spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash).

The vast majority of processing power used for bitcoin has nothing to do with actual processing of transactions nor securing them, it's solving pointless problems to intentionally slow down the network.

The specific problem of Serbia seems to be that they are Russian friendly and as such the EU / USA conspiracy theories abound. This is also the main reason why they thought they could oppose NATO. They hoped that Russian support would be a strong enough deterrent to NATO. Luckily at that time Russia didn't intervene militarily afaik. 

One thing that is particularly interesting in the Russia /  Serbia relationship, is that both countries have the same policy about their expats.

&gt;Do they actually include all services or will they find reasons why service XYZ is not a ""true"" video streaming service?

&gt;how the ""EU and America"" was manipulating things to ""make Serbs the bad guys"".

Well that one is pretty much obvious to anyone with eyes, or at least that the UN and America. I recall the Serbs being unequivocally described as the new Hitlers with a people of born Nazis in news coverage up until the mid 2010s, it was fine for anyone to take shots at them uncontested.

In reality there isn't a clean side in either of the two big conflicts in Yugoslavia, but you wouldn't know that if you only listened to the UN or American sources for any length of time, likely because they stood to profit off the breakup.

&gt;**Trump bought Miss Universe in 1996** from ITT Corp., eventually moving its headquarters from Los Angeles to New York and signing a co-ownership agreement with the NBC network. NBC aired Miss Universe from 2003-2014 but, along with Spanish-speaking network Univision, dropped it in September 2015 after Trump's controversial campaign statements regarding illegal immigration.

&gt;Trump eventually settled with NBC, buying out the network's 50 percent ownership. Just days later, he sold the Miss Universe Organization to WME/IMG, which moved the broadcast to Fox.

&gt; ""I have truly enjoyed owning the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants. **When I purchased the pageants many years ago, they were in serious trouble. It has been a great honor making them so successful**,"" Trump said in 2015."" The pageants are now in the hands of a great company that will shepherd them to even greater levels of success.""

""I think it's so great of me to make such a failure of a pageant into a global success all thanks to the man of the hour, me. Overall I'd rate myself a 10, easily. What, you think I should get an 11? I agree! Liberals are crying right now because they're such losers and I'm so hugely successful! Sad!""

2902,"But legally it was non-existent, yet tiered internet didn't happen. Why? Because it was too early, but also because traffic was way lower than now. 

The battle we're witnessing at the moment is between equivalents of transport companies (i.e. Netflix, YouTube, etc.) and road administrators (i.e. ISPs). Transport companies use a lot of trucks and they make a much larger impact on the roads than regular cars. So, what does a country usually do in this case? They introduce levies on heavy users to compensate for the fact you'll need to repair the road earlier than without trucks on the roads. On one hand that's good, because you pay for what you use - if you use roads less (for example, you're travelling by car) you pay for the roads in taxes, while if you use them more, you pay a levy in addition to taxes. On the other hand, it may create an abusive situation. Most states not only own roads, but also postal services, including logistics companies. By exempting state companies from paying a levy, you can lower their cost of conducting business, meaning they can offer lower prices than the rest. At the same time, you can also increase the levy to a point where the only reasonable company you can choose is the state one. 

So the question is: who should foot the bill for the infrastructure? Should it be the ISPs or content providers? If the first, then you allow these companies to freeload on ISPs' work, basically having the whole backbone for your business plan handed to you for a very low price. If the second, then you give them a powerful tool to eliminate the competition by combining infrastructure and in-house content.",(temporarily in Denmark),/r/europe/comments/7eqko4/why_is_net_neutrality_important_and_what_can_we/dq7d6ql/,uelkamewrybady,1511380799

An AK unit could be as little as 2 people. AK consisted of over 380,000 people and AK created the only governmental organization during WW2 devoted solely to saving and protecting Jews.

I am commemorating nothing. Just observing a pissed off Ukrainian nationalist spitting all over himself and I have to say it's fun.



So, back to your articles and your frequent use of the phrase ""Nazi collaborator scum"". Yes, they were scum and that's why Poles don't want UPA memorial in Poland.

3137,"&gt;Good for the economy doesn't mean good for the people.

True in general but when it comes to the EU for Germany the benefits still outweigh the cons by a lot.
&gt; We have low unemployment, but a lot of people working and still having to be supported by the country. I love travelling in Europe and meating different people, but this can't mean letting everybody in, living here off welfare, like gypsies and other balkanese do (take a look at Duisburg).

Working people that still have to be supported by the country is not the EUs fault. It is very difficult to immigrate into Germany (or any other EU country for that matter) and live off welfare. Read the law, it clearly states people have to be working or be able to support themselves to move around freely. The reason why people that work still have to be supported by the state is that people keep picking on the people below them instead of going out on the street and look at where the wealth really is. Politicians are elected by them that constantly make decisions that hurt these people 'in order to protect the hard working middle class' that is constantly shrinking in reality.

However I don’t think we ever have 100 percent that Russia will be peaceful, if history teaches us one thing. That being said it is absurd when some people in Poland think their country could be a target. The only thing that Russia might wanna do in the next decades (still I think a slim chance of it) is to “reclaim” Russian speaking territories. So the Ukraine from Kharkiv to Odessa might have something to worry about. Odessa seems far from the border, but it has such a strong presence in Russian culture (songs, books etc) and is always regarded as a Russian city by those, so this could be the gem Putin would like, as it’s a beautiful and well known city. Belarus might be made to tighten the union against it’s will, but that’s on Lukashenko, as instead of bringig the local language back he decided that the country uses almost exclusively Russian and not Belarussian. Thus throwing his citizens under a bus if Russians decide that Russian needs saving = Russian speaker. Out of the EU probably the Baltics have some very slight reasons to fear, but I really don’t see Putin’s army invaiding Daugavpils...

3179,"&gt; To begin with, rich and established armies have lost to poorer, more experienced, and more determined armies in the past

Yes, but lets be careful what we mean by ""lose"" in the modern era. Losing is a function of failing to achieve political goals, not military defeat, loss of territory, or significant loss of fighting ability. When the US has a straightforward goal like in the first gulf war, its a hilarious one sided slaughter.

&gt; And consider what Russia has done so far in the case of information warfare and political influence in the US, I'd rather we not invest in another Yalta.

Why does everyone talk like the US isn't doing the same to Russia, and hacking the shit out of them? The Russians simply don't *talk* about it because they are a repressive state. You really think the NSA doesn't have them compromised 6 ways from sunday?

All the russians have succeeded in doing is inflaming existing bigotries in our rural populations, while that helps them achieve specific political goals, it doesn't improve their opinion of Russia.

And the US is taking pretty severe measures to reduce their influence, they summoned google/facebook/twitter to receive a public whipping, and are cracking down on russian media firms.

&gt; Not to mention that, full cynicism applied. A restart of a cold war might benefit America as well by re-solidifying control of West Europe as well as domestic public opinion.

It might. But I'd like to think that the past has proven that a powerful America is not a bad thing for Europe. We like europeans, we want to see your countries prosperous, and have no real interest in telling you how to live your lives day to day.

&gt;the concept that ""boys don't cry"" is a historical blip in the grand scheme of things.

Oh really? Isn't crying a biological indicator of despair? If you publicly show to everyone that you are out of balance, unable to pull yourself together, then people can't really depend on you cause you need more help. Then what's the use of you, as a man, a builder, a warrior, or a king?

You talk about art. Look at the monuments, and statues of crying people. They usually cover their faces with their hands (except of Marry, the angles, and Jesus)- as we do naturally, all humans. We are naturally ashamed of exposing our vulnerabities- in fact rightfully so, as our enemies could use them against us. Jesus wasn't afraid of exposing himself, in fact he knew he's gonna be betrayed by his best disciple.

There are also purely biological reasons which doesn't support the theory. Females search for the most suited male in order to reproduce. Females need protection, aspecially when they are pregnant and largely unable to work or feed onself. That's why male, must had always been strong, and usefull. Another biological reason, is the fact that man are in general much less emotional than women. There are very important reasons for that, but I don't need to go into details. Being strongly emotional is a feminin trait. Jung wrote on that a fair bit.

 Femininity amongst boys is quite unusual in history, but happens every now and then. It can be an indicator of a falling civilization, if feminity transcends into sexual life. At least that's what Camille Paglia proposed. ",Vratislavia (Poland),/r/europe/comments/7emgrs/special_eurobarometer_465_it_is_acceptable_for/dq6zytq/,nikogoroz,1511366905

I am split between this, one the on hand having a test where people can just write whatever they think is right is just completely impossible to grade. What school test in exams is if you know what certain ideas are.

I just wrote a test in macroeconomics. If you want to criticise you can't drag on about it very long. There is a time and a place for criticism and questioning, but in exams teacher want to know you know certain theories and how they are used. 

There are other way where you can give students more freedom, and teacher need to construct assignments where you can argue more freely and make your own observations. That is hard though, and it demands a lot of students.  

About politics, you just need to find out what political views your teacher has, and quote that in assignments. Sorry Greece :(. If you think about it, it boost critical thinking, you just need to be critical of when and where you write what.

We now know this was all bullshit to throw the 99% of people a bone to fight over while the holders of capital got their hands free, but it wasn't so clear from the start.

So we deregulated, and that meant that literally anything would go. So mortgage debt was tiered, bundled with more debt of the same tier, and sold as security based on the likeliness of that debt being repaid. 

And the shitty tiers were tiered again, and sold again, and tiered again, and sold again. 

And thus everyone got their fill of the shittiest security in the world, and then shit really hit the fan: people weren't paying their debt, which meant houses were entering markets again at lower prices, which meant that it didn't make financial sense to pay their debt even for people who would've otherwise, since the prices they bought at were so inflated they actually stood to lose money by paying it. Cue they domino effect. 

As such, it's quite hard to pinpoint the guilty parties with the rigour that is customary for criminal charges. It sure would be nice to get some of that money that made it out back into the everyday economy, but that would require a systemic change far beyond criminal charges.

The US has fucked up not only South America, but the Middle East (which has caused conseuqences for Europe), but, **again**, in the context of media propaganda in Europe, the US is not even half as a threat as Russia is.

&gt; Eastern euros have already flooded our towns and cities and made such change to cultural life in the Uk that the vote last year for brexit was basically to kick out all the eastern euros.

And? I am still in Latvia. If you want to ''kick them out'' don't destabilize the place they'll go back to. I don't know if you know this secret, but the better off our countries are (including, y'know, not fucked up by Russia or their geopolitical ass-blasting), the less we'll come to Western Europe. Au contraire - as things get better here, more people will come back here, because many of those in England right now are not those who enjoy Western life and ideals.

&gt; watered down our living standards

OH BOY! So, instead of blaming the Parliament for shitty policies, you blame fucking hicks from Bauska and Kaunas for watering down your living standards? What kind of house of cards did you live in where decades of Indian and Pakistani migration did nothing to your country, but a quick surge of Eastern Europeans ''destroyed'' your living standards. Are we shitting down your chimney or jacking off on your cucumbers? 

&gt;  ill be fucked if I have to fight a war for them as well.

You sound like such a lovely person! Don't forget we're already fighting wars together. So while our men bleed for you in countries Eastern Europeans barely even know about, you sit on your ass in your apartment in Cornwall, Dublin or wherever the fuck got the worst of the Eastern European migration, and condemn half of Europe to death because your cunt politicians managed to blame a fucking Polish farmer for bringing down the quality of life in a country that enjoyed more than 60 years of post-war economic growth.

&gt;**Is zero-rating allowed under the Regulation?**

&gt;It depends. There are different types of zero-rating practices, some of which are more problematic than others. BEREC’s Guidelines look at different examples and provide guidance on the extent to which they could be considered permissible under the Regulation.

&gt;The BEREC guidelines explain that some practices are clearly prohibited – those where all applications are blocked or slowed down once the data cap is reached except for the zero-rated application(s). Others are less clear-cut and will be need to be assessed by NRAs against a number of criteria set out in the Guidelines.

And in the meantime these services are rearing their ugly head across Europe. [Here's an example from the Portuguese co MEO](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNGlrABUIAAr9RO.jpg:large).

People say it's no problem for net neutrality because every service can participate but in fact, Telekom has various technical requirements on how the data is transported and also  As you can imagine, small internet businesses often don't have the money to adapt these requirements or even to go through the enormous amount of paper work required to participate and therefore are disadvantaged.

3372,"A lot of American newspapers, highly respected ones actually are suggesting that the French president is quickly taking the lime light away from Merkel. 

Macron, unlike every other Western leader refuses to act as if he's above Trump and/or mock and use his low approval ratings as easy political brownie points. Trump is 71 years old, an extreme narcissist, went to a military styled boot camp for the rich due to his bullying at a young age, believes his own conspiracies, and also is leader of a super power nation. When all of his countries ""allies"" turn against him, where does he go, who does he turn to? Macron has extended Trump an olive branch and is actually throwing the American people a life raft in the process rather than pointing and laughing. There has to be something said about that man on that front alone. Even though Macron is more Obama than Obama. Trump does the opposite of Obama, Macron does the opposite of Trump, without the sly insults. 

Merkel has had huge fuckups rather people here want to admit that or not (going with the 'not') but overall out of all the world leaders out there, I'd say she's absolutely been one of the best leaders overall. Given the fact that Germany is a rather large country, it has huge influence in the EU, has some influence with geopolitical conflicts, and has to juggle so much.. there's a lot of room for fuckups, she's avoided many of them. Even the immigration thing I think was one of her biggest failures but in the process, Germany facing an aging population (very dangerous, like Japan) - she essentially gave Germany a booster shot for an entire generation. So with her failures, there's almost always been a reward in the end for the German people.

My biggest dislike for Merkel is her letting other countries become a punching bag so Germany can enjoy saving face. IE the Snowden leaks where supposedly the NSA was spying on German citizens. In reality, the German government was spying on German citizens, German government wasn't the victim but rather an accomplice. Merkel didn't say a word, instead let Obama, likely her greatest ally at the time take the fall for it until later leaks revealed that the German government was spying on it's own citizens, selling that information to a foreign state, and then in return getting even better spy software to be even more efficient.. and the idea that Germany had zero control over this, that they had no choice but to spy on their citizens.. I saw Merkel as virtually flawless (except for her same sex marriage stance) until that happened, because the response of her and her party while it was happening and them knowing what really was going on.. using it to play victim and political points then when the truth came out, not putting as much effort into saying ""we fucked up."" 

I'm not sure how long Merkel can stay in power, if she'll win another election but I think compared to what's out there.. Germany has a decent leader with her in power. ",,/r/europe/comments/7ep6bp/a_world_without_merkel/dq6pgma/,irishtayto,1511352288

3374,"&gt;Even working half-time with kids and household is very demanding imo.

I'd even say kids and household alone are more demanding than ordinary full time job. 

Anyways, many people here seem to perceive the issue one-sidedly: evil eastern european men opressing their women, while the truth is a bit more nuanced. Gender roles pressure is a two way street. It's no coincidence some of our women prefer Germans and foreigners over locals, but i think you overestimate the role of equality and overlook another factor: money. Men are expected to provide, and yes, largely by women too. Those who don't are seen as failures. 

Now, it's easy to point fingers when you enjoy your 35-hr workweek, 30 days off and other benefits of WE social security. Whole different story when you have to work your ass off 10 hours a day 6 days a week with almost no free time, like many men here still do. Not because they want to buy a porsche, as u/fluchtpunkt apparently suggests, but simply to make the ends meet (as if nobody noticed the obvious correlation here - the poorer the country, the less ""progressive"" women and more ""money oriented"" men are). 

Results? In Poland, the average male life expectancy is almost 10 years shorter than that of women. We also have one of the highest suicide rates in Europe, with male to female suicide ratio also being [the highest in Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xzwau/male_suicides_to_female_suicides_ratio/?st=jab02d7x&amp;sh=eb267c88)

It is not my personal liking, it is the default.

Messing up the clock like that would mess up your biorhythm and health.

&gt;The middle of the light period is 13:00. https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/belgium/brussels

That is because you are in the wrong time zone. You use CET when WET would be more appropriate.

.

&gt;That's insane. Just move the clock forward and make the activities match the light.

Human activities change all the time, who is to say our grandchildren will not resent this move like we resent day light savings since it douse ""not match real activity""? 

Activity is no measure when noon should be placed. If you don't want to waste sunlight wake up at 4.20 simple. 

&gt;The problems come from switching twice per year. There is no reason we can't leave it on permanently.

Russia tried to stay at summer time when they stopped switching two timer per year, they learned this was stupid AF especially during winter so they went back to ""winter time"" which is the non augmented timezone's time. 

&gt;And we have a clock to organize our lives and working hours, so the effect on working hours takes precedence over the fetishism of putting the number 12 on the solar noon.

Working hours take no precedence and are a non argument. Working hours can be changed on a whim, once we set noon to noon we are not going to keep changing that.

&gt; *You want to know what this was really all about? The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.*

But I think that the main point of discussion in this thread is the role of men and women, but the formulation of the question and how it's extremely open to different interpretations and people who have answered this has clearly made a lot of assumptions.  The differences in interpretation brought on partially by differences in culture ensures that people aren't really answer the same question to being with.

I don't agree with the topic question formulation. For example, in Lithuania family is seen as #1 entity. Job and state comes after that. Thus if someone asks wether you value family or job more..

3682,"I disagree, CSGO lootboxes are *the* worst **because** you can trade them for real money. That's where gambling comes in. If they were bound to the account, people would be as motivated to buy them. I've read articles in mainstream media, of teenagers losing 10.000 EUR or more Gambling with CSGO skins. I haven't read a single article about anyone spending that much on Overwatch lootboxes.

As a comparison, in Heroes of the Storm you get in-game currency when winning a game, on top of that you get a lootbox, that gives you random loot from the shop. Loot you can buy with in-game currency. Duplicate items give you more in-game currency to buy items in the shop. You never feel inclined to buy currency playing that game.

That's just one example and loads of games are doing it extremely differently, even within Blizzard games, Overwatch, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, do it very differently, depending on the game. Hearthstone is way too expensive with their in-game currency, for my liking.. While I feel the others are quite balanced.

So a lootbox isn't just a lootbox. What makes it work good and what makes it greedy and horrible, is the algorithms behind it, not the lootbox itself. Loot RNG has worked well for very long in loads of games, even before Video Games in D&amp;D.

3721,"Unpopular opinion here, but what about games that use them as end-of-game loot? A bit like looting a mob or a boss in an MMORPG? I play a bunch of games with loot boxes, *only* having cosmetic effects - and what's inside the loot boxes you can buy for in-game currency anyway if there is a specific skin you want - a currency you can't buy for money..

I don't think it's fair towards the game, that just use loot boxes as RNG loot, instead of a boring currency you just spend in a shop. 

Not all games are super greedy games and if they want to ban them for being addictive, well what about extra HP in Candy Crush and 90% of moneitization on Mobile games?

The only game I can really think of at the moment, being a Gambling game is CSGO as you can actually make real-money by reselling the skins...
I don't think  it's fair for other games, where you can't make money from Lootboxes and where it's only cosmetics and have no affect on gameplay.

If all the games having loot boxes need to be labeled gambling, then **every** monitized game should, as it also results in Whaling - Which people don't seem to get the difference between whaling and gambling...

Either way, this won't stop people with addictive personalities, it will eventually lead to something else, without any help or therapy.

I know everyone is hating on EA, but seriously, don't let this ruin every other game that has a fair system for loot boxes or loot in general, just because negativity surrounding EA and Activision is always dragging headlines.

Perhaps instead of letting grey haired politicians who know nothing about games, ruin fun experiences in some games, just because of EA - maybe provide more therapy and help to people with addictive personalities and people who have a hard time managing their finances..

3747,"The Captains Regents (that's their official position) are elected every six months, that's true, but they are indirectly elected by the members of their unicameral Parliament, i.e. citizens do not have to vote every six months. The Parliament, whose official name is Great and General Council (*Consiglio Grande e Generale*), is elected for a five-years term.

Captains Regents can be re-elected, but between a term and the next there must be a three-years interval, and even if many of them are elected for a second term, only a handful of people have been elected three times, and as far as I know only one has been elected four times.

Their term is fixed and begins on April 1st and October 1st. If one of them resigns, or dies in office (last time happened in the 1930s, if I'm not wrong), or is otherwise incapacitated, a new one is elected for the remaining time up to the next term, so it could happen that someone have a term lasting only a week.

There is this priciple that everything is done in a collective way, so that no power lies in the hands of only one person, and that reflects in the way Sammarinese institutions refer to them: even if they are officially known as Captain Regents, on official documents they are referred as the Most Excellent Regency (*Eccellentissima Reggenza*), i.e. pointing out the position rather than the people. Something like: ""The Most Excellent Regency has declared that..."" instead of: ""The Capitains Regents have declared that..."".

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa6QR-s2pzY) is the official announcement of the new regency, read out to the citizens from the balcony of the government palace by the secretary of State for internal affairs, between the two leaving Captains: ""By order of the *pro tempore* Most Excellent Regency, I do announce to the people of the free land of San Marino that the Great and General Council, in the today's sitting, having invoked the assistance of our glorious protector San Marino for the safeness and perpetual freedom of our ancient Republic, has elected Captains Regents for the six months from [date] to [date] messrs [full name of one] [ordinal number of his/her term] and [full name of the other] [ordinal number of his/her term]"".",Italy,/r/europe/comments/7ecm90/what_do_you_know_about_san_marino/dq6cu4p/,gerri_,1511324993

And it's not a isolated example either, since you had the same thing happen in China with the Great Chinese Famine that starved tens of millions, an which itself was caused by Mao's attempt to socialize the economy through the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution, where once again millions were extrajudicially murdered &amp; tortured, with millions more stripped of everything &amp; imprisoned, in a attempt to purge capitalists &amp; abolish the bourgouise as a class. 

Socialism is a retarded ideology. In dozens of countries over the past hundred years, it's CONTINOUSLY caused authoritarian dictatorship, mass murder &amp; hunger, while also entrenching the same widescale poverty it promised to abolish, in the most corrupt way possible.

A lootbox isn't gambling in my opinion, unless you can earn real money of it, like CSGO. There are plenty of games that have lootboxes, with fair currencies and ALL content of loot boxes can be obtained through a shop, using in-game currency anyway.

The question is, where to draw the line. I'd love to see CSGO's loot boxes be bind-on-account, so you can't trade it. But I doubt grey politicians can see the difference between an indie-RPG using loot and then a CSGO, that's straight up gambling.

Games like SCGO are straight up gambling, while Battlefront II is a horror due to the fact it's not only cosmetic, but is P2W...

Where did I say that? I'm just explaining how there can be a decrease in the production of food, but what make such a famine was the kulaks not wanting to sell the food because they prefered to speculate, and that's a motive of the collectivization. The industrialization was esential for the country as it was threaten by foreign powers as it was demonstrated during the civil war and in the 2WW and with a fas industrialization there would be a improvement in the production of food as it was later demonstrated.

I disagree, but I think medicine is a special case, because nothing in our cultural or philosophical background has us prepared to treat it like a free market. No one goes around complaining about how they need to regulate the iPhone cover market, because people can act like rational consumers and buy any cover they want at a competitive price.

Medicine on the other hand, is a restricted market, where you cannot legally purchase many of the things you will need (like aneasethetic for a surgery), and the physicians can't tell you how much things cost because they don't know. It is an extremely inelastic demand curve, because people will pay anything to stay alive.

That's why I think medicine in particular must be regulated, but other markets I think work fine without it. ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7ejzeo/while_were_relatively_safe_in_europe_our_american/dq60vdb/,SuperObviousShill,1511309719

4030,"Okay, you have an experience with dumb ignorants that simply choose to not speak Czech even though they live there. Probably they would be able to speak, they just dont want to, because ""meh, they understand me, why even bother"". I am sorry for that. 

Random people in Slovakia would speak Czech, because they can just like a person who never left Slovakia could speak English. Vast majority of Slovaks watch Czech TV channels. It starts already with small children watching kids channels (that was also my case), because we dont have any (good ones) in Slovakia. I dont think Czechs watch Slovak TV channels. Also as far as I know, Slovak movies are dubbed into Czech language when broadcasted in Czech republic. We dont dub Czech movies in Slovakia. A person can learn language just from listening to it in the TV (especially kids, they are like sponges).

Anyway, I checked the source page of this map and in the discussion I have learnt:

* Another important point: **the survey is not about the Portuguese but about the inhabitants of Portugal (i.e. no Portuguese living abroad were interviewed (or they didn't count for Portugal), whereas immigrants living in Portugal were included).** ([source](https://jakubmarian.com/average-number-of-languages-spoken-by-the-eu-population/#comment-1728595678))",Slovak in Tyrol,/r/europe/comments/7egb08/average_number_of_languages_spoken_by_the_eu/dq5tvsl/,mirakdva,1511301839

The media's usually more interested in riling people up, so they just [write pieces like this](http://www.bbl.is/frettir/frettir/islendingar-greida-fyrir-kjarnorku--kola--og-oliuframleidda-raforku/11443/) that proclaim the absurdity of farmers in Iceland being approached by energy companies to certify their vegetables as ""nuclear-free"" or whatever, or sensationalist headlines like ""Iceland is now powered by coal"".

But that's actually what's **supposed** to happen. That a 100% clean energy economy is certified 100% dirty is the market working, because it means that 100% of the energy got subsidized by producers of the actually dirty energy. I.e. the real test of clean-ness is whether you're obligated to pay for these certificates, which energy companies in Iceland aren't.

You can read reports [such as this one](https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/atvinnuvegaraduneyti-media/media/2015/161018-Upprunaabyrgdir-i-islensku-samhengi.pdf) that (in the very beginning) explain the rationale behind this.

4113,"&gt; A Pole Divided

&gt; by Donald Tusk

&gt; Poland as a set topic... You could think: just sit and write. But here there's void, only somewhere in the distance hussars and uhlans go, uprisers and marshals, Dzikie Pola and Jasna Góra rave, missions of the epoch, Polish months, victories of failure. Victories?

&gt; How to free ourselves from these stereotypes that accompany us almost since we were born, strengthened with literature, history, popular ressentiments? What will stay of Polishness, if we deduce from it this whole sublime-grim-preposterous theatre of unfulfilled dreams and ungrounded illusions? Polishness is an abnormality - this association is forced upon me with hurtful persistence, whenever I touch upon this unwanted topic. Polishness invariably causes in me the reflex of rebellion: history, geography, historical bad luck and God knows what was forced upon my shoulders these burdens, which I do not really want to carry, neither can I put down (I do not want to do so regardless of everything?), burnt a stigma; and command me to carry them with pride. So I stand here as abnormal, filled with Polishness to limits, and there, where others say 'human', I say 'Pole'; where others say 'culture', 'civilisation' and 'money', I scream; God, Honour and Fatherland (everything obviously starting with uppercase); when others build, love each other and die, we fight, rise up and die [my note: previous word referred to death by natural causes (umierać), while this refers to death by unnatural causes (ginąć)]. And only in short moments of a pause we ponder over our national ethos a bit more critically, we read Brzozowski and Gombrowicz, we become more normal. There is some tragic disparity in Polishness - between imagining and fulfilling, plans and realisation. It is an ethos of those with bad luck, an ethos of losers and at the same time not accepting their defeat. Freedom is in it the highest value [----] [cut out by censorship - Act from July 31, 1981 on the control of publications and events, article 2, point 6 (Journal of Acts no. 20 position 99, changed: 1983 JoA no. 44 position 204)] jumps upon great deeds with usually bad results. Polishness is indeed inadequate a projection of our joint complexes, inadequate to grim reality. What is more beautiful than Poland is the escape from Poland that we have on the ground, dirty and poor. And this is why it makes us dumb so frequently, blinds us into the land of myth. It is the myth itself.

&gt; Yes, Poland reminds of failure, bad luck, storm. And how could it not be this way? ""What else is our life? - wrote Andrzej Bobkowski in ""Szkice piórkiem"" [""Drafts with a little fountain pen""] (how many on point comments about Polishness can you find there!). - Rolling short pieces of a string on a cardboard without being able to connect them with each other. Where should I look for a birth act of my grandfather? Where to find a trace of a grand-grandmother? What can a thought that is turning back be attached to? To nothing - to stories, almost to legends of this country, which rented itself an interconnecting room in Europe and for tens of centuries tries to arrange itself in it with all the conveniences and an illusion of a room with a single door, exhausting all its energy on arguments and fights with those who walk through it. How can one think of arranging this room with nice furniture, trinkets and cabinets when they [subject isn't literally given] are covering the floor in mud all the time, break and bruise items? This isn't life - this is a constant temporality of a life of a butterfly and that's why there may be so many traits reminding of this insect in our character? How can we be ants?...""

&gt; When I not down these loose comments, I feel at every moment, that I can't catch something with my attention, that I can barely formulate banal thoughts. The thought is distorted by the mood, emotion, and these can change as well. Because although Polishness triggers associations created by history, it is also an act of happening, after all, it is the unsure look into the future. And I am yanking myself between bitterness, melting mood, pride and uneasiness. Then I think - in a Polish way, pathetically, that Polishness, independently of a burdensome heritage and tragic association, stays our common, conscious choice.",(temporarily in Denmark),/r/europe/comments/7eiplq/google_plans_to_derank_russia_today_and_sputnik/dq5maut/,uelkamewrybady,1511294531

The last few years has changed this a bit with the rise of the Sweden Democrats. They are on the conservative (and populist) side of the spectrum and are very well-represented outside the big cities. But the other big parties are still all fairly liberal, and most people still vote for them.

4177,"Almost one year after the Berlin Christmas market attack that left 12 innocent people dead, six Syrian men planning to carry out another attack were arrested by German authorities on Tuesday morning.

The Telegraph reports ""the target of the planned attack was a traditional Christmas market which opens in the western city of Essen next week"" and that the suspected men all entered the country as asylum seekers.

""Authorities were alerted to the suspects by other asylum seekers who recognized them as jihadists who had fought for Isil in Syria,"" reports The Telegraph. ""Officials have yet to comment on the target of the planned attack.""

As to the intended nature of the attack, prosecutors involved said the men planned to carry out a terrorist attack utilizing weapons and explosives.

In December 2016, Tunisian migrant Anis Amri, at the instructions of ISIS, drove a truck through crowds of Christmas shoppers in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring another 56. Then President-elect Donald Trump called the incident ""an attack on humanity.""

The men arrested Tuesday ranged between ages 20 and 28; four of them ""entered Germany as asylum seekers in September 2014, before Angela Merkel opened the country’s borders in her controversial refugee policy, while the other two arrived in 2015.""

According to Straits, the arrest marks the second time in a month that Syrians have been taken in by authorities on suspicions of terrorist activity.

""Earlier this month, a 19-year-old Syrian man was detained on suspicion of planning a bomb attack,"" Straits reports.

To prevent another Christmas market attack, concrete blocks have been installed around the central squares to keep trucks from plowing into people enjoying the festivities.",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/7ekt3g/germany_authorities_arrest_six_syrians_planning/dq5n659/,JimJones4Ever,1511295358

4203,"Stvar je u tome da prije 1000 godine od Triglava do Crnog mora se praktički isti jezik pričao, no onda kroz povijest je utjecaj Mađara, Njemaca, Venecije, Turaka dao svoj danak jeziku koji je dobivao razlike u određenim područjima. No ja govorim da to ne znači da nije postojao osjećaj pripadnosti nekoj skupini, a ta pripadnost se pripisivala hrvatskom entitu još od 16tog stoljeća, prije bilo kakvih konstrukcija naroda. Sad ulaziš u sferu Šešeljevih fora sa tim standardnim. Pa nije nastao standardni jezik radi stvaranja nekog izmišljenog identiteta, nego za borbu tog identiteta protiv strvinara sa istoka što se pokazalo ispravnim pogotovo u Dubrovniku krajem 19tog stoljeća. I taj ""standardni"" se doslovce nigdje ne koristi baš u tom formatu osim možda na dnevniku al to je više jezik nastao na temelju kako je pričao visi stalež u Zagrebu krajem 19tog stoljeća, za primjer pogledaj i pročitaj Glembajeve. Jednostavno mi je ta teza o narodnosti kao nekoj izmišljenoj konstrukciji smiješna, jer da je izmišljena raspala bi se ubrzo. Pripadnost narodu i domoljublje su često najjače emocije koje mogu nastati kod čovjeka, što se pogotovo vidi u sportovima di je emotivni ulog uvjek jači na međunarodnoj sceni naspram klupske. Nismo genetski modificirani da je nekako to usađeno u nas nakon francuske revolucije. Isto tako su razmišljali marksisti početkom 20tog stoljeća kada su mislili da će tokom WWI narod i vojnici odbiti boriti se protiv neprijatelja i dići ruke na aristokraciju jer oni su pravi neprijatelj. Naravno to se nije desilo jer većina ljudi nisu utvare poput marksista koji nema identitet i zbog toga preziru ostale pa su se počeli igrati sa tuđim životima. Jedino di im je plan upalio je Rusija, naravno to ništa nije bilo spontano kako romantički učimo u udžbenicima, nego je uloženo puno kapitala i propagande u to, i negdje 15zak godina borbe i prevrtanja.

Simply different social preferences. I think the Western German model is the world-wide historic standard. After the war it developed into different directions.

Since the reunification it has obviously normalized a bit. But the differences remain very obvious.

I think the tsunami argument is not one of the stronger ones, particular concerning Germany. We really only have a handful of plants in reach of a tsunami (Brokdorf, Brunsbüttel, Unterweser), which is an extremely unlikely event for central Europe anyway. A stronger argument (and a deciding factor, in my opinion) is that while modern nuclear power probably *can* be operated safely, decades of experience show that it will not be done that way, because for-profit companies cut corners and humans make mistakes. There is such a long list of incidents, accidents, undisclosed problems and the handful of really large disasters (Chernobyl, Fukushima, Kysthum, Hanford, Three-Mile-Island,...) that it's a valid decision for a society to say that it doesn't want to roll the dice on such a scale. An INES 6+ event in the Blue Banana is not something we are ready to deal with.

Another argument, at least for Germany, is nuclear waste disposal. This is evidently a politically unsolved problem (since decades), suffering from, again, improper implementation, NIMBYism and so on. We also really don't have many large unpopulated areas to store spent fuel and radioactive parts of dismantled plants. This is obviously not a concern for large countries like the US, Russia or Australia.

I'd say, however that getting out of coal is more urgent than getting out of nuclear, and doubly so for lignite. I'll support any plan to moderately extend nuclear plant lifetime (under government control if necessary safety upgrades make continued operation unprofitable) if that eliminates coal power in an equal amount.",Not with SC I swear,/r/europe/comments/7egxdg/infographic_greenhouse_gas_emissions_tonnes_per/dq57lsh/,Turminder_Xuss,1511279953

4306,"&gt; If it was a high profile festival celebrated and appreciated by pretty wealthy people who could afford top quality painters

You do realize that painters don't have to be commissioned by someone wealthy in order to make a painting, right? This new link doesn't even show a painting but just a drawing. And as for the earlier link, Jan Havickszoon Steen is kind of famous for his work *not* depicting the sort of things wealthy patrons would commission; and we clearly don't see a wealthy family depicted in his painting of the celebration.

More importantly, Jan Steen was a *catholic*. It is not really that surprising that a catholic painter known for depicting homely scenes would depict a *catholic* celebration (which Sinterklaas was) that was only permitted to be celebrated in private; and the existence of the painting doesn't really tell us anything other than that some catholics continued to celebrate it despite the public ban.

&gt; If it had to be forbidden, that means it was quite popular and likely remained so 

Hardly. It didn't matter how popular was or was not. What mattered was that it was *catholic*. The Dutch republic was calvinist; and catholicism was repressed. Sinterklaas would not have been celebrated by the predominantly protestant population.

&gt; I argue that Schenkman very obviously inspired himself on the template

""very obviously?"" You're seeing what you want to see. I don't see any obvious inspiration.

&gt;  It's much more nextdoor than Spain, which Schenkman also weaved into the story. 

That happened before Schenkman. The earliest known literary connection to Spain dates from an 1810 pamphlet wherein Sinterklaas is said to go from Amsterdam to Spain to go get oranges and pommegrates. But the connection had probably been made much earlier, as the saint upon which the character is based was re-buried in the Italian town of Bari; which was later under Spanish dominion at the same time we were. This also connects to the oranges and pommegrates, since these were heavily traded with from the south.

Bavaria being closer to Spain is ultimately also irrelevant. We have no historical connection to Bavaria, but we *do* to Spain. And in addition to the above mentioned possible origin for the connection, there's once again the fact that it is a *catholic* celebration.

4331,"It might be true that right now there is more of a push for centralization but that by itself doesn't mean that it's the best option or I'd have to agree with it. I personally find the model of a europe of regions, with small governments that collaborate with eachother, much more appealing than trying to create the united states of europe like some french minister said recently. I find countries that follow the former model such as switzerland to be a much better role model than something like lets say france for example. And I believe that fundamentally countries should be formed by regions that want to voluntarily be part of that union, which is where I disagree with you that Catalonia already has that, since the referendum is being denied. If Catalonia were to become independent I would be open to following the same principle and allowing for example Vall d'Aran or whatever other region to have their own say in the matter and I think that the correct approach would be to make moves to make them happy to stay in, and not to say that ""you are bound to me and that's how it is"" which seems to be the majoritary spanish approach. 

I don't think that independence has to correlate with wanting to create separation at least in the way you say. The absolute majority of the movement has been pro europe and believes in all the principles such as freedom of movement of people or goods. To me it's much more about self-governance, starting anew and bringing the government to a level that's closer to the people, hopefully with the implementation of some form of direct democracy (which ties with what I said of smaller countries working better on principle and having Switzerland as a good model). It's already been said by both sides that noone has to renounce to their spanish nationality if they don't want to and I don't see in what practical way people would be separated. If what separates them is only the fact that they are no longer all considered spaniards, I have to wonder who the nationalists relly are.

Even if it was just these 4 -and I'm pretty sure this isn't the first case (in fact, plenty of people in this thread pointed that it wasn't)- that's roughly 1.98 terrorists per 100k. The equivalent rate among the non-asylum seeking Germany population would produce about 1650 terrorists. 

Of course, the real rate for terrorists/asylum-seeker is much higher. For example, just from the 2014 crop, the [Ansbach suicide bombing prepetaror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Ansbach_bombing) was another. Now the rate among 2014 applicants applied to the general population would produce over 2000 terrorists. And it gets increasingly more implausible once you start adding up all terrorists.

So e.g. in the case of Iceland various EU countries are obligated to buy these credits, which gives the energy company more money and allows them to lower their prices.

We now know a lot more about these systems such as West Antarctica and how certain mechanisms make them unstable, which means they can disintegrate within a relatively short timeframe and contribute multimeter sea-level rise within this century.

Each degree of warming ultimately causes around 0.4 meters of SLR due to thermal expansion alone (not sea ice and glacier melt): expansion:http://www.pnas.org/content/110/34/13745.full

Certain key glaciers lead to extensive retrograde slopes, which means the ocean will flood in underneath the glacier, when the calving front reaches the grounding line. This leads to marine ice-cliff instability, whereby the tall calving fronts rapidly fall off the glacial face, as the glacier melts from underneath and is simultaneously lifted by the ocean:

Although mountain glaciers contribute relatively little to sea level rise, it's worth noting that they will likely disappear completely in Northern Europe within this century:
http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00669-3

Thinning of ice shelves (that hold back glaciers) is stronger along a channel structure formed by the ocean circulation under the ice shelf. This factor is unaccounted for, and for certain glaciers in West Antarctica such as Dotson Ice Shelf (DIS), the channel will melt through, and the ice shelf collapse, within 40–50 years, almost two centuries before collapse is projected from the average thinning rate, if focused thinning continues at present rates:

Some of the first efforts to quantify potential global warming contribution from Permafrost indicate that methane emissions form permafrost areas in the high north will be significant:

Equilibrium climate sensitivity may rise with a warmer climate, meaning that this is yet another factor that may accelerate global warming: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013GL058118/full

4589,"&gt;state they were going to take in 800,000 refugees?

After a rise in asylum seeker arrivals beginning of the year, it was projected that more than 800,000 people could arrive, so a public debate was started were the German government looked for ways to reduce that number.

So it is rather the opposite, the German government tried to keep as many refugees away as legally possible.

Some foreign media however reported instead of 'Germany is expecting a sharp rise in asylum seekers up to 800,000' that Germany 'will take in 800,000' refugees. This is obviously a completely different story. The gist of the reports I have read about it in international media was, that the UK/US or whatever government was making a fuss about a small number of refugees, the Germans are going to take in a much larger number.

The left wing media typically wanted to shame their respective government to take in more refugees, so they spun it like the German government was glad to accept these people, the right wing media on the other hand started to call the German government crazy to counter the left wing media.

While the whole time the German government was looking for a way to have less refugees. For example by speeding up deportation procedure, trying to have other countries take refugees, negotiating with Turkey to stop new arrivals, increasing foreign aid funds to some countries etc. 

The German government did however reject some populist proposals like shooting refugees at the border, letting people drown at sea or building a fence inside Europe, which where obviously against human rights or in case of the fence, would not solve the problem for the whole of Europe, for example not for Greece and not for Italy. 

Since the public discourse on the right had already shifted to Merkel is crazy, the German government's attempts to find a European wide solution was than transformed in a narrative, where Merkel had first invited people to come to Germany and was now trying to push these people on the rest of Europe. 

&gt;didn't suspend the Dublin rules

After there was the sharp increase in refugee numbers, Germany stopped for some time the attempts to deport people inside of Europe because it took a lot of time each case and the courts had stopped these attempts with the justification that the countries of entrance couldn't handle the inflow. Dublin was not 'suspended' since Dublin deportations are a optional thing anyway. 

&gt;Yes, conditions were imposed on loans given to those countries, who because of the shared currency had no other options but to take the loans on those conditions, or drop out of the Eurozone (which was no solution because all the debt was denominated in Euros). So any 'choice' these countries had was an illusion, they had to accept the terms being offered by the IMF and Germany or completely destroy their economy.

In the Netherlands you will always be a foreigner. THAT is the tip of the iceberg here and shows just how ingrained this mindset is in our society.

4784,"I don't think they did. They were uncompromising on the matter of families of rejected refugees being allowed to come to Germany even though the rejected immigrants would have to leave Germany. Is that wise ?  
I am by no means a friend of the CSU but in this case I think they were right, albeit for the wrong reasons.  
Think of it: The families of rejected refugees would have counted towards the ""limit which must not be called limit"" of annual immigrants. But they didn't have a chance to stay, it would only have been temporary - and that would have been unfair towards real refugees who would have had a chance to stay - but were not permitted because they were above the limit.  
Also, those families would have had the right to come - but Germany would have been under no obligation to provide transport. It would have been up to the families to pay for it. So how many would then have sold everything, their belongings, their houses - in order to come to Germany, just in order to get deported back again ?  
Or the rejected refugees themselves ? Better to have a place to go back to rather then being dumped back in your old land and have nothing and nowhere to go.  

So - yeah. I think the Greens are as much to blame for taking such a hard stance on an issue where immigrants were rejected on grounds of trying to claim refugee status instead of just trying their luck as what they really are - immigrants.

There's a reason competitiveness indices have tolerance, healthcare, liveliness and such as important factors making a city attractive. If Bratislava or Budapest wanted to be just as attractive for business, they'd need to work on their culture as much as on financial incentives.

4955,"&gt; but family reunification is at all time highs

And that will fall down to normal levels soon enough. There will be people who will want to reunite with their family and people who will want to get back home. It depends on how terribly their city was destroyed, how integrated they are in their host country and that kind of factors. Helping Syria rebuild quick may help, it's worth doing a study. You can incite some of them to leave and accept the rest over time, or get EU to have other countries better share the load. This level of immigration is high but manageable, it would only be an issue if the government hosts people stupidly and get them to live long term all in the same few places, in other words if assimilation policy is poor. A mistake more readily made by conservatives, usually less likely to account for long term sociological factors and population dynamics.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; It's just a really unefficient way of spending money.

Germany in particular has room to manage the 2015 wave reunification included, with its insane surplus that is markedly beyond EU's recommended maximum of 6% and should be driven down, but keeps growing because of a lack of public investment inside German borders. Money isn't used ""on refugees"", it is used on Germany's infrastructure, which needs it badly, and the construction sector is a solid purveyor of local activity, which means GDP growth, decreased unemployment, increased purchasing power and all that jazz. While receiving 1.5 million refugees in two years is a lot, it also forced the German government to spend money which resulted directly in about 40% of that year's growth IIRC.

&amp;nbsp;

That's for the 2015 wave reunification included: High but mostly just a sudden spike on the timeline, so manageable, especially in the case of Germany where it actually enabled a much needed increase in public investment. Thanks to this, the low internal consumption has increased in the country and, beyond Germany, this helped the entire Eurozone, which restarts thanks to quantitative easing, Germany's internal consumption and Brexit. That also came with a political cost and a risk down the road if assimilation is not done properly, but we can see it's more balanced than some people would think.

On the other hand, a lacking resolution in fighting climate change means +3 or +3.5°C, which translates directly into way more important waves that will occur every year for way longer than the Syrian war. Africa is incredibly large, it can hold 4 billion people that would still be an average density of 132 persons per km². China has 143, India 393, Indonesia 139, Japan 335, South Korea 511. So Africa may well hold 4 billion people and not leak any more than China, India, Indonesia, Japan or South Korea do. It just needs to be developed enough, and *climate change fought against*. From a purely migration-oriented viewpoint, fighting against climate change and accompanying Africa's development is number 1 priority. A left-leaned government will more readily execute these policies than a conservative or a liberal one.",,/r/europe/comments/7eacny/merkel_prefers_new_vote_after_talks_fail/dq4le44/,_Handsome_Jack,1511239273

 * Petrol is quite a bit cheaper, like -10% vs the Italian stations just across the border.

 * They don't do panini there, everything is a [piadini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piadina). Same ingredients on the inside but they use a flatbread instead of regular bread. I actually like the format better because when they take the cold day-old sandwich and throw it in a toaster the heat passes through the dense flatbread much more easily, unlike the insulating panini bread where the toasted top scratches and burns the roof of my mouth and then I get disappointing room temperature cheese in the middle.

 * looking on a map the the air distance to the old fortress city is pretty close to the surrounding countryside, but is is literally a mountain of stairs and roadway to climb.

Eg if Spencer had killed somebody then he would agree with such a ban, but currently he does not agree. The rest of his comment is that Europeans (and the users of this subreddit?) accept censorship too easily. He's interpreting this move by the Polish to censor the ideas Spencer has.

5031,"&gt; Studies also show that young people here in sweden are more positive to casual sex than earlier generations so obviously its not sexual conservatism as such.

What are those studies? Are they actually having more casual sex than earlier generations? That's not what's happening in the US or the UK - you can look up and you'll find plenty of studies showing millennials have far less sex, far latter and far less casually than older generations did; I'd be surprised if it's happening in Sweden. If you mean those studies show that young people are more positive to casual sex than older people, well, that's a given in every generation - married people with teenage children or grandchildren tend to be far less sympathetic to casual sex than their teenage and young adult children. 

I don't know why you think it's political, I didn't use conservative in any political sense whatsoever, political conservatism isn't a lifestyle. In fact, a well-known conservative political philosopher, Michael Oakeshott, famously argued that people with more nonconformist lifestyles should be political conservatives (probably related, it's long been rumoured that the real reason he never got a knighthood was because he got caught having sex with a female student in a public beach a couple of days the Queen's Birthday Honours List was announced - in any case, his bohemian lifestyle was well-known). More extensive views on sexual boundaries are exactly what characterizes more sexually conservative, or more puritan mores. Pretty much all of these behaviours would be seen as highly improper and sexual in the Regency or Victorian periods - just chek a Jane Austen book. Not so much a few decades ago - some would be considered vulgar in the fashionable society, but surely not among hoi polloi. On the reverse, the hand on the lower black was actually seen as courteous and civil, and surely not erotic, among the upper crust - pretty much it still is.

[Asia increased their emissions in 10 years with the total amount Europe emits.](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2016-07/global-ghg-emissions-download3-2016.png)

That's why we could completely stop and Asia and Africa could increase their emissions with Europes total emissions in just a few years. They alone can potentially easily emit enough so we reach +3-4°C. [And the Paris Accord is pure shit to be honest](https://www.politico.eu/article/paris-climate-deal-is-meaningless-cop21-emissions-china-obama/).

&gt;A country can propose to reduce emissions off a self-defined “business-as-usual” trajectory, essentially deciding how much it wants to emit and then declaring it an “improvement” from the alternative. To prevent such submissions from being challenged, a group of developing countries led by China and India has rejected “any obligatory review mechanism for increasing individual efforts of developing countries.”


On mass immigration, I agree the asylum claims has gotten down a lot from 2015, but family reunification is at all time highs. The stop from Libya is temporary as long as Italy pay the local warlords there, we have no idea how long this will continue.

What I don't understand is, if you vote for a green party you get maybe 10% less emissions, but 5 times as many refugees compared to the alternative.

5044,"My interpretation as someone who grew up in the East and has been living/working in Kreuzberg since the 90ies:
There are many aspects. 

First of all the GDR was actually much more nationalist, then the FRG. You had pledges of allegiance to the flag in school, lots of stuff was national something, something, like the NVA. Also the whole narrative of everyone being against the state doesn't hold up. Most people led normal lives and the rejection of everything different was actually welcomed by many - a bit like around 68 in the west when people welcomed police action against hippies - except there was never a moment when society changed to a more liberal one.

Then there was the narrative of being the anti-fascist state - xenophobic incidents and neo-nazi violence where kept under the rug and often framed as conflict between drunk youth (something you can still see in Bautzen). There was book published about this stuff this year (sorry it's german)


http://www.schmetterling-verlag.de/page-5_isbn-3-89657-153-2.htm

Also the infamous attack on Zionskirche (sorry it's german):

http://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/reportage/1987-angriff-in-der-zionskirche-staatsluege-und-rechte-offenbarung/20462700.html


Also the people from Cuba/Mosambique/Vietnam were actually kept separate from the rest of the population - my mom told me stories of parties in the early 70ies where Cubans were caught partying with East Germans and then reprimanded and even sent back. So people had little interaction with other cultures and kept seeing others as just that - others. This is probably one of the reasons why Vietnamese people are still called Fidschis even by reasonably educated people in the East.

I had lots of prejudices as well, but the moment you realize the big Arab guy with the huge Gold chain and Rottweiler that looks like he is in the gym 24/7 is actually gay might be the moment when you see that the others aren't one faceless group but quite mixed as well with some nice people and some assholes - but they are assholes cause they are assholes and not cause they ""aren't from here""",,/r/europe/comments/7e49np/liberal_party_fdp_quits_coalition_negotiations/dq4ekd7/,throw_away_I_will,1511231244

Ah I think I see what you are saying. 

I think you misinterpreted what the hebrew school was saying. They never said the Arabs were our eternal enemies or some evil people.

What they said was that the ""The arabs have 22 countries and we have only the one. Why must they also have this one"" or ""The israelis have offered peace multiple times and the palestinians rejected it"".

Keep in mind, that while hebrew schools teach the israeli side, they are also talking to 10-12 year olds. It can be kind of difficult to teach kids this age the complexities of the situation, and that while israel can do wrong, that israel still deserves to exist and for many things in the right.


Its hard to teach kids, and in general people, a non black and white view on geopolitics, and especially this one. I just think you misunderstood what they meant because you were young.

5073,"&gt;That is an absurdity that genuinely puts in question any knowledge you have on this.

I assure you my employer feels otherwise.

&gt;The notion that every single Irish person who has reproduced has been unable to do so without doing it with someone who is a direct ancestor of a Viking is absolute nonsense.

To be clear, the claim is not that all Irish people who've ever lived are descended from Vikings, merely that all *modern* Irish are descended from Vikings.

Let's do some back of the envelope math on this. [Chang's results](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/Ancestors.pdf) show that in a randomly mating population of N individuals, you only have to go back about log_2(N) generations before you reach the first ancestor who is ancestor to everyone alive in the population today, and you only need to go back to about 1.77*log_2(N) generations ago to reach the point at which everyone alive then who left any modern descendants at all is an ancestor to the entire population (the ""all-ancestor date""; also note that [Lachance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0AlnbM3hVwZTTIzSU9nbHZ2Y0k/view) shows that these results are quite robust to even fairly high levels of inbreeding). Chang also shows that once you get back to the all-ancestor date, about 80% of the population is ancestral to everyone alive today (these individuals are called ""all-ancestors""), and the other 20% is ancestral to no one.

If this date is more recent than when Vikings began intermarrying with the local people, then necessarily every modern Irish person has a Viking ancestor.

The Irish population peaked at around 8 million in the 1800s, is around 5 million now, but was below 1 million for most of the last millennium. If you use 1 million as the population size and take a generation time of [29 years](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.20188/full), you get about 578 years before the first person ancestral to all Irish people, and about 1023 years until the all-ancestor date. If you use peak population size of 8 million, you get 665 and 1178.

The first Viking incursions into Ireland started in 795, and by the early 900s there's clear evidence of Viking settlements in many places in Ireland. All that needs to be true is that *one* Viking is ancestral to a person who would go on to be ancestral to all modern Irish, and given that we hit the point at which 80% of people alive are all-ancestors around or before that time, we need speculate that only a handful of Vikings left descendants in Ireland during those early years of the incursion in order for it to be essentially certain that at least one of them is an all-ancestor.

The numbers admittedly land at a place where there is just enough wiggle room that there might not be any all-ancestor among the Vikings. If there's just enough inbreeding and/or isolation among disparate parts of the island, if population sizes were a little larger than estimated, etc. If lots of factors line up just the right way, the precise statement that all modern Irish are descended from Vikings may not hold.

It is definitely not an absurdity, however, and I'd still wager it's more likely true than not. I agree that intuition leads us astray here.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7d4364/european_countries_that_qualified_for_the_2018/dq4fljv/,jjberg2,1511232350

5075,"What exactly is the conspiracy theory here? 

I find utterly bizarre that people are so cavalier to discard the influence of such a well-financed special interest group like Soros' political organization. 

I can only imagine if that pamphlet had been published by some right-wing institution. Well, actually I don't have to. For example:

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy

&gt;A shadowy global operation involving big data, billionaire friends of Trump and the disparate forces of the Leave campaign influenced the result of the EU referendum. As Britain heads to the polls again, is our electoral process still fit for purpose?

The Koch brothers or Aarron Banks are always sinister figures ""buying democracy""; if anyone questions Soros, even though his action is far less transparent, it suddenly becomes a ""conspiracy theory"". 

I mean:
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/19/mp-calls-for-inquiry-into-arron-banks-and-dark-money-in-eu-referendum

&gt;Speaking in parliament, Ben Bradshaw said there was “widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference in western democracies”. He described as “very worrying” a series of investigative reports published this week by the Open Democracy website into the funding of the Leave campaign.

Arron Banks is being investigated because of a piece published on Open Society, which is Soros financed website. That's the entire extension of the ""widespread concern"". No other source is cited. 

And why would anyone would have a problem with Farage questions?

&gt;So I shall be writing today to all 226 of you, asking some pretty fair questions:

&gt;“Have you ever received funds, directly or indirectly, from Open Society?

&gt;“How many of their events have you attended?

&gt;“Could you please give us a list of the meetings of all the representatives [you have met], including George Soros [himself]?”

5137,"While I appreciate you taking the time, you got quite a lot of things wrong.

&gt; The Euro, which had existed in virtual form since 1999

It existed even before that, it was just called ECU. 

&gt; One glaring flaw in the Euro, is that it combines countries with varying productivity, debt, GDP, and economies together under one currency. In 2000, one year after the Euro was launched in virtual form, Germany had a Gross domestic product was 1.9 trillion US dollars. At the same time, the GDP of Greece was 124.4 billion US dollars, the GDP of Ireland was 99.4 billion US dollars, and the GDP of Spain 595.4 billion US dollars. Originally, this was a good thing for Germany and other exporter nations, as joining the Euro lowered the value of their currency, making it easier to export their products to the economically smaller countries in Europe. Basically, Germany would subsidize countries like Greece, Spain, and Italy, and in return these countries could now afford German exports.

You are drawing a line where there simply isn't one. Total GDP is irrelevant. The total GDP of two countries say exactly nothing about whether a currency union between the countries would work. Germany and Austria could have a currency union without any problems as their economies are similar, despite Germany having almost ten times the GDP. 

&gt; Due to their involvement in the euro, countries such as Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and others now had low interest rates, and were able to borrow a lot more money than was available to them in the past. This would end up causing the European debt crisis. This would end up costing them when their economies collapsed in 2011, and they had no way to pay off these debts.

This as a general statement is simply wrong. Italy didn't go on a spending spree, in fact, their Debt do GDP ratio *decreased* between 2000 and 2005. Italy didn't have a way to pay off their debt in 2000 either. Spain reduced its debt to gdp ratio by 16% between 2000 and 2005. Spain didn't overspend, they just ran into major troubles when the housing bubble in their country collapsed and they had to bail out banks. 

Generally speaking, only a very few countries are capable of paying off their debt. This isn't a relevant metric. Even Germany won't pay its debt back completely. The only thing that matters is that the debt is sustainable for a country. And, thanks to the Euro, it still is for the mentioned countries (apart from Greece) as their interest rates remain low. 

&gt; Due to low interest rates, smaller, less efficient economies could borrow large amounts of money that before they never were able to.

These countries borrowed heavily even before the Euro, Greece at some point reaced over 20% in interest on their debt when they still had the drachma. The difference was that the countries were able to rid themselves of that debt by devaluing their currencies. 

&gt; As a result, the debts compiled by countries, thanks to low interest rates, have become nearly impossible to overcome.

Again, the only thing that matters is sustainability. 

&gt; The strong German economy, which previously was a blessing for these countries, became a huge disadvantage, as it became very hard to export goods outside the EU, as they are too expensive.

You are mixing stuff up. The currency was too expensive for these countries *before* the financial crisis, this has been much less significant since the crisis as QE and other actions by the ECB have significantly reduced the value of the Euro. Greece by the way never had an export industry to begin with. And I don't agree that ""the strong German economy"" was a blessing for these countries prior to the crisis. You also ignore that the German economy only really started picking up speed during the financial crisis. 

&gt; This means that the EU has forced a controversial policy of austerity on some of the hardest hit countries, which has failed to make a significant positive impact on these countries economies, with a large social cost, most notably extremely high unemployment, for the citizens of Greece, Italy, Iceland, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and others across the Eurozone.

I would argue that there wasn't another option that doesn't involve these countries leaving the Euro. Simply propping up their economies with even more debt isn't a workable plan. 

I'd like to quote something that was written about Mark Blyth's book ""Austerity"": ""Mark Blyth has brilliantly shown that Austerity does not work. However, he has failed to consider the possibility that expansion may not work either"".

&gt; From an economic perspective, the best option is to end the Euro.

Wrong. Even Varioufakis stated that ""entering the euro was a bad idea, leaving it now would be suicidal"".

&gt; with weak economies such as Greece and Italy,

Italy doesn't have a ""weak economy"". The south of Italy does. The north is comparable to Austria or Germany. 

&gt; no one wins

This isn't abotu ""winning"". And actually, Germany benefits quite a lot from this. 

&gt; On solution is to bring in a multiple tier system, which would bring in three different currencies

I have read about the suggestion of two currencies, but three is simply too much. It won't work. The only way a split currency would work is having a northern euro and a southern euro, the northern group being led by germany and the southern one by France. A group without any of these two countries would be irrelevant and the currency worthless. 

&gt; There would be criteria set for each for qualification into each tier, so countries can move up and down, and even drop out if they still can’t meet the standards that are required.

This would ruin the point of the euro and also be ridiculously expensive as countries that are on the edge between two groups could be forced to change currency every few years. 

&gt; countries would be placed with similar levels of size

I don't understand your opinion with size. Size does not matter for currencies. 

&gt; Germany and France obviously have larger levels of economic activity than Latvia and Cyprus.

Totally irrelvant. Latvia would be a good fit for a currency union with Germany due to the nature of their economy. Cyprus would be a better fit for France. Latvia and Germany go better together than Latvia and Cyprus. 

&gt; There should also be an independent committee to regularly check on each member of the Eurozone, so they would not be able to accumulate the huge debts that caused the debt crisis.

As I have stated before, the debt crisis wasn't caused exclusively by debts that were too high. And if you had an independent committee of this kind: Then you could stay with the current euro. Maybe add some financial transfers on top of that. The problem is that such a body would exercise direct authority over the budgets of different countries, which would mean reducing their souvereignty. Most parliaments refuse to give up their budget right, and I can fully understand them in this regard. 

&gt; While Euro may not have worked out in practice as it did in theory, with some tweaks, it could become an effective currency for Europeans.

Aye - we arent used to that, like not at all. I can only recall a single minority government (one ""level"" lower than national parliament) and it went really bad.

Thing about this is that Merkel would have to get together with either Greens or Liberals to even have a base for anything which in reversion would naturally piss of the other. The political positions of the left sided parties is.... questionable from Merkel's or more specific from her CDU point of view so counting on them to get shit down is out of the question. Leaving our right wing populists AfD - nobody wants to (openly) work with them. They have a lot of open racists and Nazi relativationists in their ranks so you really dont want to get any relation to them if you give a shit about ~75% of the german population.

I really dont see anything involving a minority government happen. IF we get to vote again there will be some shifts, but I highly doubt there will be enough movement to enable a Left-Wing coalition.

You could suggest shared enlightenment values in terms of democracy, rights of man and so on but those things aren't really pan-european in any sense. In Europe alone, i would only suggest Britain and France have a deep long lasting commitment to these things. The rest of Europe either took them on through the threat of force or were channeled into these things by western (US) forces. I wouldn't trust a Romanian or a German to defend my British liberties for example. The Spanish lived under a right-wing dictator only in the 1970s.

5217,"&gt; People that feel it's not even worth considering, are, in my eyes, privileged.

I'm sorry but you are simply incredibly ignorant if you think that wanting to live in a country where you have equal rights to other people is being privileged. I'm not a snob for wanting to be able to marry, or at the very least have a civil partnership. You clearly have no empathy if you can try to claim such a thing as a small issue that doesn't justify wishing to ignore a place. I could visit Slovakia for a holiday, and I could live there for a time, but I have every right to turn down settling in a country that thinks I don't deserve being treated as a proper human.

&gt; What I mean by that is do we really make only the selected most developed Western European countries as the acceptable societies for ""humane"" life, and draw the line so as even an upper-middle income country like Slovakia is not good enough?

Yes, especially if you have gay workers? It's not like the countries are unable to change. If Slovakia was that invested in attracting westerners, it could have tried to appeal to them. But instead all we get is eastern Europeans calling us snowflakes for liking to stay in places where we have all the rights we deserve.

&gt; Also, why are these countries even in EU, if they're actually not acceptable?

They are acceptable members of the EU. They are just behind enough that they cannot complain about westerners turning their nose up at them. I will consider living in eastern Europe when I am not treated as a second class citizen there. I have no obligation to come before that, and neither did the employees of the EMA.

Look, I truly do not hate Slovakia or any other eastern European country. I'd like them to have more agencies, I cheer every bit of progress they make on both economic and social points, and I look forward to when your quality of life is comparable to that of the west. In fact, I'd even be OK with complaining about westerners avoiding moving there just for the sake of higher wages. That's privilege. You just simply cannot judge westerners for wishing to live in countries that treat them better, and you absolutely cannot judge people for wishing to live in countries which give them equal rights.

5301,"Behind a paywall:

&gt;The Dutch parliament has warned its government to start making serious contingency plans for a “no deal” Brexit, highlighting increasing nervousness in some EU countries that stalled negotiations could lead to the UK crashing out of the bloc in 2019.

&gt;A parliamentary report compiled by senior Dutch MPs said the “unthinkable” was now possible: “a chaotic scenario in which the UK on 29 March 2019 departs abruptly from the EU, with no exit agreement or transition period [in place]“, it said.

&gt;The Dutch economy is one of the most vulnerable to Britain’s exit from the EU on the back of its strong trade links and geographic proximity. The report commissioned from the Dutch parliament is likely force a response from the right-wing government of prime minister Mark Rutte. It comes ahead of a crucial Brexit summit in Brussels next month when the EU27 must decide if the UK has made “sufficient progress” to advance talks to a trade deal and the future relationship.

&gt;Anne Mulder, one of the Dutch MPs, who compiled the report said: “Negotiations are in a deadlock. The UK is divided and some politicians in the UK are unrealistic. This is a negotiations about limiting the damage”.

&gt;The Dutch assessment urges the EU27 to begin internal discussions on trade talks and negotiations over a transition. It was compiled after Dutch MPs met with senior UK government ministers, including then-former deputy Brexit secretary David Jones, earlier this year.

&gt;Brexit talks have stumbled over how much the government of Theresa May is willing to pay as part of the country’s financial settlement. The Dutch report said the Brexit bill was proving to be the “the most important political obstacle” but urged both sides to compromise to stop the issue from blocking vital talks on trade.

&gt;It also called on the country’s industries – from fishing to agriculture – to begin preparing for the impact of a “no deal” on their businesses and called for more transparency on the European side about the state of talks.

&gt;Britain is one of the Netherlands long-standing EU allies. With Brexit looming, the report urges the country to forge new partnerships with like minded free-trading countries and not sit in “cold fear” of the Franco-German partnership.

&gt;“The benefits of a solid relationship with the United Kingdom after the Brexit are big, not only economic but also political when it comes to cooperation in the field of security, defence, police and justice. The Netherlands certainly has an interest in a comprehensive trade partnership”, said the report.

&gt;It also hinted at the Brexit boon that could be delivered to the Dutch economy after the UK’s departure, saying Brexit would mean the Netherlands will become a “logical gateway” to the rest of Europe.",London,/r/europe/comments/7e822w/dutch_parliament_warns_government_to_plan_for/dq3tc4x/,LemonG34R,1511207965

The reason why you subgroup langues like balto-slavic (which is a subgroup of indo-european) is that you have to go back in time fewer years to find a tribe which speaks the root of both slavic and baltic then you have to go back in time to find a tribe that speaks the root of both french and Hindi.

The complete FDP argumentation is more than fishy and neither Lindner, nor Kubiciel neither argue trustworthy, nor have body language that is the slightest trustworthy either.

So, their argument is illgocial and their way of presenting this argument is more than weak, while it contradcit the arguments of all other parties of that negotiation, even the one that have no reason to back up for example the CDU (as even Claudia Roth does).

And in special the FDP realises NOW that they are unhappy with the results, at a moment where the only disagreement were left was between Green and CSU?

People overlook that Germany became the largest holder of those bonds because they bailed out their own banks, banks that had bought those bonds from Spain and Greece for prices that suggested they had the same creditworthiness as Germany! Where was the rhetoric about reckless German banks? Where was all the lecturing about moral hazard for greedy bankers making risky investments (again)? Nope, much easier just to blame people in other countries... 

Agree it was a difficult issue to face, but in this crisis, there were several different steps that could have been taken to relieve the Southern European countries. First and foremost, running looser monetary policy would have been hugely beneficial to those struggling countries. But it seems that even some mild inflation in northern Europe was too high a price to pay. Secondly, help those countries to recover economically before introducing austerity and (much needed) reforms. Thirdly, in the case of Greece, there needed to be debt forgiveness. It has been clear to everyone 5 years ago that Greece was never going to be able to pay off that debt. And yet we keep punishing them for it, more austerity, more unemployment... they have literally lost something like 1/3 of their economy since the start of this crisis... 

The disappointing thing is that all of this was predicted well in advance - economists all over the world were telling these guys austerity was a mistake. Ignorance cannot be claimed as a defense in this case.

Thx for the constructive points. So just to pull it all together:

+ We know that Lenin wanted an European-wide revolution
+ Lenin was pro-Polish before Poland was independent capitalist nation
+ Lenin, believed that Pilsudski will commence the revolution
+ As soon as he realized that Poland won't become communist, he knew that Ukrainian SSR must be joined with the federacy as fast as possible, before the Polish help to install republican government in Kiev
+ When Polish offensive reached Kiev, Lenin decided to crush Poland, and push ""onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland""- as Tuchaczewski ordered 2 July 1920

So I think we can agree, that if Poland went communist it would be the best ally of Lenin, but because it didn't and rivalized for Ukraine it became his worst enemy.

For example, our most right-wing party (VVD) has done a lot of work to introduce more market elements in healthcare, but even they would not water down the Affordable Care Act as much as the Republicans have. They'd probably look at Obama's original plans and go ""That could use a bit more solidarity"". Although, now that I think about it, I wonder if the more leftist American politicians are moderating their own points of view because they think that stating their actual, possibly more leftist, views would be political suicide.

5683,"&gt; So ethnicity has nothing to do with genes, it's just whatever you believe you are?

Pretty much, what part of your genes says your Polish?  Is there a marker in there that identifies you as Italian?

Now you certainly share more of your genes in common with people from your country than people from countries further away (neighboring countries are often indistinguishable).  Thats how those genetic testing websites work, you mail them a sample and they tell you how similar that sample is to the other samples in their database.  But that doesn't mean there's some genetic marker that says you're Spanish.

Ethnicity can certainly be based on ancestry, my parents, their parents, and as many generations I can count considered themselves French so therefore I'm French.  But there's not some genetic marker you carry that holds that information, you have to be told and have some information that shows what previous generations in your family thought of themselves.

Rachel Dolezal is a funny case, you know no one ever asked her to do a DNA test right?

Lisbon had a majority against (more than 2:1) and Blair had promised a referendum on the European Constitution in his manifesto but weaselled out of it because (as he later admitted) he knew he’d lose. If either of those had been amended enough to gain popular support they’d have pushed Britain a long way out of the EU but done so much more gradually and on more favourable terms. 

Blair was also the leading figure pushing for the EU’s eastern expansion, which immediately lead to an increase in opposition to the EU when it took effect. He also waived the right to immigration controls and lied about the number of immigrants who would come until just before that decision was irrevocable and refused to change his mind in that last week. The public supported it until it was revealed that he’d lied, then support collapsed (just like the Iraq war…).

5897,"&gt; I think we have a very different view on this.

It's not about the views, it's about the facts.

&gt;The Transnistrians have their own government, their own flag, their own currency, their own army, their own police, their own territory, their own passports, everything their own.

Which are all fake. One of the fundamental conditions for statehood, according to the Montevideo Convention is the ability to engage in relations with other states. Transnistria isn't recognized by any other legitimate state, and the includes Russia despite you falsely trying to imply otherwise. The fact that Russia de facto engages with the Transnistrian government does not change this, as Russia has proven many times to be a dishonest state, selectively respecting international law only when it suits them. For example, Russia ships ""free"" gas to Transnistria, but then adds that gas to the external debt of Moldova. If they recognized Transnistria why ask Moldova to pay for Transnistria's gas consumption? Of course Transnistria would never be able to afford that gas, because they completely rely on Russian subsidies to survive.

&gt;their own passports

Those passports are merely worthless pieces of paper, since no country recognizes them. If you print a passport for a fictional country it's worth just as much as a Transnistrian passport. Transnistrians who travel internationally, including the leadership, use Moldovan or Russian passports for that purpose.

5908,"&gt; Influence on public opinion, via use of appropriate news selection in social media (but also real provocations); a method already well described and researched on the examples of USA and UK; specific directions in Poland: 1. undermining of sympathy for Ukrainians (the strongest front, but not very effective, although it might change in longer perspecrive); 2. creating a negative image of the EU and West (including negative news and fake news about immigrants and refugees). While 1. does'nt duplicate PiS propaganda (because apart from individual cases, the government is still rather pro-Ukrainian), 2. does, and very strongly (anti-immigrant/refugee themes are among core ones).

I think that the first part starts coming to fruition (which is what Tusk mentions in his tweet).
