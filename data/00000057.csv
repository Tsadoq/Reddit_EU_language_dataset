92,"&gt;Where can I find a conclusive number for the effective tax rate? All of the sources I find are different.

There is no definite answer because corporate taxation varies according to the tax rate and the allowances available, and the allowances will add up differently depending on how much, and what type, of investment is required.

For example, in Germany a company that buys a factory building can offset the cost against tax, in the UK they can't. So if a company requires a lot of investment in buildings in Germany, it will have different allowances to a company in the UK, and different allowances than another company in Germany that doesn't require so many buildings.

The OECD has a detailed publication showing the different ways corporate taxes are applied: [https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/corporate-tax-statistics-second-edition.pdf](https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/corporate-tax-statistics-second-edition.pdf)",,/r/europe/comments/jt8v68/europe_has_the_lowest_corporate_tax_rates_in_the/gc5488x/,WhiteSatanicMills,1605263482

101,"Very unpopular opinion:

I don't think think the recent trend of looting garbage in supermarkets is a good thing. Its one of those things where at first everyone seems to agree and there don't seem to be any issues until you go to the details:

Is this free food really going to poor peoples? Often they can't give it to food banks etc for legal reasons. I have seen cases reported where it was mostly rich kids like progressive university students doing this. Then they will even make a mess doing this and the working class supermarket employee has to clean it up. Sure they will say they are all super careful but try going through an overly full giant garbage container without making a mess.

If its not going to peoples in need then why should they get free food that is subsidized by all the paying customers? And if you want do enable this on a large scale who is actually getting this free food? And we already have working systems for giving free food to the poor anyway. Soften up the laws and have supermarkets and food companies work together with food banks and other such places which is already happening for decades btw. and happens more and more.

I think this ""dumpster diving"" activism had some good initial ideas and shed light on food waste and also to reduce packaging waste. That said I feel these ideas are already everywhere and have been for a long time and there are political parties and EU regulations and all that working for it. So its not like nothing is happening to combat that. I would prefer supermarkets not throw away the good stuff but have some organized system where it goes to poor peoples instead of green activists and have the rest of the stuff well disposed and where possible improve recycling etc. 

If you aren't super poor maybe work for your money and buy it like the rest of us which actually helps to pay for all the free stuff going to poor peoples and we can make incremental improvements which are happening. Living a bum life and cursing on capitalism and virtue signaling how our system is oh so terrible does not help anyone.",,/r/europe/comments/jtc37y/heres_what_the_guy_found_in_a_hypermarket/gc4wycb/,CyberianK,1605255555

182,"This is **NOT** victim blaming. 

In a dictatorship laws only hold meaning so long as they prop up the dictator. Whatever (little) value your life holds in a dictatorship, it only holds value as long as the status quo is maintained. 

If you are threatening the dictator, your life is forfeit and you should be cognizant of when you're doing things that threaten the dictator or even just things the dictator's thugs perceive as threatening. 

In other words, if you're doing something that endangers you, it should have some purpose. After everything that's happened he should probably know better and not think it can't happen to him just cos he's innocent. He'd better have been doing something *really* important and not just out for frivolous reasons. 

This is *not* like a woman dressing """"provocatively"""", having too many drinks or walking alone at night. This is more like a guy putting his hand through the bars into the lion's den thinking it's a tamed lion cos this looks like a zoo, and getting mauled.

Well the guy in the car obviously is frightened and just drives past them when seeing them. The fact that the first of the officers recoils pretty hard already confirms that the guy was going pretty fast. And it looks like he passes quite the distance in a short time. 

So obviously at this point he is driving 20 km/h into a crowd of policemen and for most of them he probably came out of nowhere. He totally seems like a terrorist.

415,"&gt; TDS is not saying that all people disliking Trump are deranged

That is very literally what it is doing.  The ""D"" stands for ""deranged.""

I have absolutely seen it used to refer to anyone who does not support Trump; I'm surprised you'd deny that.

&gt; The pandemic f.i., he did horribly, but to say all 240k deaths are his fault and the US is the worst in the world is TDS.

That's a straw man.  No one, or nearly no one, thinks that the U.S. would have had zero deaths without Trump, or that the U.S. is the worst in the world.

So you're setting up a straw man and saying that this makes it OK to call someone deranged...  Honestly, even if it's not a straw man, I'd say calling someone ""deranged"" is pretty uncalled for, don't you?  That's about as bad as half the posts you quoted originally.

&gt; I did not use such language, yet I am often on the receiving end of it

Maybe don't go through a forum and collect posts that you find ""hateful,"" conglomerate it into a single post, post it, and then link it in ANOTHER thread talking about all the ""vile people"" you found, and referring to them sarcastically as the ""tolerant left""?

That's not exactly avoiding a toxic confrontation, is it?  And, honestly, I would say that those last parts ARE ""expelling hate."" 

&gt; despite being a center right Biden-man since the primaries...

You, obviously, know you better than me.  But this is not how you come across.  Why would you make the conglomeration-of-left-hate post; why link to it again later?  Why do you have such positive opinions of Tucker Carlson, an extremely biased right-wing pundit?  Why do you defend a horrible phrase like ""TDS"" using a bizarre straw man?

To be clear: I'm not saying you're lying.  I'm explaining why ""moderate political beliefs"" is not what came across in these posts.

&gt; Do you remember 2012 and how Ro.ney was absolutely vilified for milquetoast comments like 47% and binders full of women? 

I've seen this accusation before and honestly I don't buy it.  ""Binders full of women"" was laughed about as a weird turn of phrase.  People can, and should, mock politicians even for reasons like this.  I don't think anyone thought it meant he secretly hated women.

Obama was vilified for (mis)saying ""you didn't build that"" in a speech about how people help you in your life.  I've literally heard that recording hundreds of times; it was used VERY seriously to attack him.  That's called politics.  No, it's obviously not unique to the left.  Come on.

&gt; Well, I am on Reddit and I know which side in the US is having the most violent riots and protests. 

...yeah another really unbiased view here...

Right wing extremists have killed more than left wing extremists in the past year.  The *mainstream* right wing (not extremists; mainstream politicians) is currently refusing to accept the outcome of the current election, and threatening to use every resource at their disposal to overturn it.

It's wrong to burn buildings down for political reasons.  And if there were any political deaths at these protests (honestly I think I only know of one from the left, but I'm sure I'm missing some), that's also horribly wrong.  But bringing it up in this context---implying that the left is somehow worse---is completely insane.

&gt; I am waiting for leftist condemnation of protest violence, but it is hard to find. Both in politicians as commoners. 

OK I found it for you: https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-biden-condemn-violence/fact-check-joe-biden-has-condemned-violent-protests-in-the-last-three-months-idUSKBN25V2O1

I got it by googling ""Biden condemn riots.""  It took 3 seconds.

Honestly, if you really are a European centrist, it seems you've just bought into a lot of right-wing (honestly pretty far right) ideas and news stories.  ActualPublicFreakouts is a far-right hangout; it's not a good source of actual news.  Same with Tucker Carlson. I don't know much about ""ShitPoliticsSays"" but considering the (very left) political leanings of /r/politics, it seems like it's very likely to distill the most toxic left-wing posts on reddit for you.  Again, not a very unbiased or holistic (or, honestly, healthy) source of information.

439,"&gt; A research team at Deutsche Bank proposed that people pay a 5% tax for the “privilege” of working from home, if they continue to do so after the pandemic, as this could subsidize income lost by lower-earners due to the coronavirus crisis. 

&gt; Deutsche Bank thematic strategist Luke Templeman said in the investment bank’s Konzept research report, published Tuesday, that a tax on remote workers had been needed for years but “Covid has just made it obvious.” 

This reads like pure satire. Except it isn't.

Russia has been a hostile power for as long as most people can remember (apart from a brief uneasy friendliness in the '90s), but its people are not typically part of the perception of Russia's adversarial relationship with the EU and North America.

If Russia were to be somehow brought into the fold, it would be to everyone's joy and mutual benefit apart from the current ruling elite in Russia. The country could undergo the most rapid economic expansion in its history and become the power it should be, and within ten years its people could be earning the kind of money that's typical in Italy or Spain. Russia's best future lies in cooperation with the EU; maybe even in membership one day. It has enough land to become the breadbasket of Eurasia and the geography to be at the heart of an enormous slice of China-EU trade.

502,"Exactly.
Fascism can happen in any country, not just Germany. Other examples of past fascist regimes include Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Italy, Chile, etc. When it springs up in other countries it doesn’t have to look identical to nazi Germany, it caters to the nationality of its supporters. People are really horrible at determining when something is fascist because newer examples of it don’t mimic nazi Germany. In the United States for example: *you know who* is a Fascist and many of his supporters are as well (not comparable to hitler, but still a fascist).

It is also extremely stupid when people hear russian or chinese or see a red flag and immediately think it is some sort of socialist or communist country. The USSR betrayed the original ideals of the revolution which was an egalitarian communist society, but betrayed everyone and oppressed the working people harder than before. China now is really just state capitalist. The workers don’t own their labor, are oppressed by the government, have to pay rent for housing, have billionaires, a rigid class structure, and of course corporations are present everywhere.

521,"Of course they are. The West doesn't want the refugees to come back because that will help speed up the resolution to the Syrian conflict. What other justification would the U.S &amp; Turkey have of illegally occupying parts of Syria if civilians return back to their homes and start picking up their lives. 

The West has put a lot of resources to try and take Assad out. They helped turn what was a protest within Syria into an armed conflict very quickly. Within weeks, the CIA was pouring weapons into the arms of the opposition protesters and the intelligence agencies coordinated quickly with the media to give them a branding and legitimacy calling them the 'Free Syrian Army'. They found out quickly enough that these are not 'moderate rebels' but a collection of jihadist who saw this as an opportunity to turn a secular Syria, one of the most tolerant countries to all religions and cultures, including a mix of Muslims, Christians, Kurds, Yazidis and others all living peacefully side by side into an extremist caliphate. 

All of a suden their 'Free Syrian Army' started to branch off into extremist groups such as Tahrir al-Sham, Fatah al-Islam, Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, Islamic Jihad Union and many other fanatics that wanted to turn Syria into Afghanistan 2.0 extreme with a caliphate. Out of that, ISIS formed and strengthened, taking over half of Iraq and Syria, beheading and commiting some of the most grotesque human crimes we've seen in our generation to innocent civilians.

Syria was on the verge of collapse with ISIS on the pinacle of taking over the whole country. The West panicked and dumped their 'Free Syrian Army' who were already sponsored with advanced weapons and tried to build a coalition of Kurds in the north and east of the Euphrates to try and slow down the imminent collapse of Syria. 

Only one country had the courage to reverse this process and still doesn't get credit for it. Russia. Russia saw what was about to happen as the jihadist swept through Aleppo, Raqqah, Hama, Homs and other major cities and closed in on the Syrian capital of Damascus. It was at this point that Russian forces, using the Khmeimim Air Base as a staging point unleashed fire and fury on the Jihadist, rolling back their progress and helping save Syria from the abyss that the West nearly sunk it into.

Instead of calling it a day, they don't want to accept defeat so are still acting as a blocker to any progress in Syria, using their media to paint Assad as the aggresor when really, he was the foundation that kept Syria from imploding.",,/r/europe/comments/jt6co1/assad_says_west_preventing_millions_of_refugees/gc3qwia/,thekremlinbot,1605226957

This is NOT a defense of Neo Nazis in any country, but I think that the rationale of people like the retard in this picture is that they somehow think that they are actually descended from Germans, and as such are supposedly suitable for Nazism.

I sure know that when the Nazi-backed Croatians performed an extremely brutal genocide against Serbs during WW2, their rationale was that Croats were actually a Germanic group of people (even though it’s been widely established that Croatians are an entirely slavic group, and a significant number of the people we today consider to be Croatians are actually de facto ethnic Serbs who switched to Catholicism hundreds of years ago), and that as such, the slavic Serbs were untermensch",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/jsrbxx/a_participant_of_the_march_in_warsaw_uses_nazi/gc3qzzi/,agent_detective,1605227014

&gt; Like, all the facade of progress was really more about ""We finally return to our pre-soviet free Poland"" than ""Progress after the regressive soviet era"" 

Yes and no. One thing what halted societal progress whas the great influence of the Catholic Church. In the communist era the Church manged to keep a certain independence and became an important centre of opossition. Even for liberal - minded people, the Church provided an alternative against the grey communist reality - an then Karol Woytyla became the pope John Paul 2. The significance of this can't be overstated. His visit to Poland in 1978 had great importance, inspiring people to create ""Solidarność"". 

When the communism fell, the Church enter the new age as a institution with grear authority in the society, strenghten by the person of John Paul 2. And they weren't shy of using this influence politically. They were the single most powerful lobbist. Religion classes in school, putting restriction in abortion laws (until 1993 abortion in Poland was legal), taking back old, pre-war real estate properties etc.

585,"&gt;Do you understand what word ""legitimacy"" means?

&gt;Luka will never be legitimate president in the eyes of Belarusians after he ordered killing and tortures of our people. 

I know this but sadly Lukashenko and the police don't care. They don't care about the people and they don't care about legitimacy. It's sad I know but nothing would stop them from trying to maintain or regain power with every tool at their disposal 

&gt;As for pro-Russian politician it's possible, but I believe Belarus will switch to parliament republic and the pro-Russian movement they created recently made it's leader former neo-Nazi and anti-Christian, who will vote for such a freak?

No one. But who voted for lukashenko? He still ""won"" the election. They don't need legitimacy just fear

&gt;What, revolution in Russia? Why not?

Because of the second largest army in the world. There are just sooo many factors to consider here but Russia is simply too strong to fall after an unsuccessful (relatively) small war

&gt;Do you know that Putin's rating is about 20%? Belarusians will just help Russians to initiate revolution and overturn Putin and his thiefs.

Man this could never happen. Never ever. Russian propaganda will paint Belarusians as disgusting west puppets the moment you throw out Lukashenko. It's very likely that Belarusians would be seen as outside aggressors that deposed a legally elected president (propaganda can really fuck you up) and want to strip Russia of it's freedom. This is simply a dream, a good dream, but not a possible one. Sorry

&gt;This will lead to independence of many regions on Far East, Siberia, South, Tatars and Belarus of course

Simply put: no. Not a lot of Russian ethnic minorities want to be independent. They are treated ok and they are pretty fine in one of the biggest states of the world. They simply don't want to be independent and they don't wanto to fight a war with Russia to be independent 

&gt;I'm not saying that we will defeat their army, but we will organize guerilla movement like in WW2.

Belarusians could but no one else would help. If ethnic minorities in Russia wanted to do that they would have already done it. Chechnya tried and everyone else saw how it ended

&gt;Nobody in Belarus cares about what he wants and don't even think about him. Our people will decide future of our country on our own.

I would love for this to be true belive me.

Drones did play a part in establishing air dominance.

Aside from Tor, all Armenian air defense is 50 years old. It's not substantial, it's barely held together crap. S-300 is not equipped to deal with small drones.

You're also underestimating he cost of the drones. TB-2 (Turkish attack drones that launch missiles) cost $8-9mil a piece (sale deal to Ukraine), each missile is about $50k a piece. while Israeli anti radiation drones that killed S-300 components and Tor are about $700 each. 

The S-300 was destroyed by 3 Harop strikes and a Lora ballistic missile, overall costing several millions (still a great deal). While the Tor took out an TB-2 ($8-9 mil) before getting destroyed by a Harop ($700k). Azeris still came out ahead as the Tor costs $25 mil, but not as significantly.

Aside from AA, it was just pure and simple air dominance.

880,"No, they're not. TB2s are only marginally smaller than a Predator drone. They're about the size of a small plane or glider, and not stealthy at all.

The success of the Turkish/Azeri drones comes down to 2 major factors:

1. Baiting Armenian air defence systems (as noted)

2. Armenia's lack of a credible air force.

It's highly likely that conventional air defence will have to be re-evaluated given what happened here and in Libya, but a sufficient air force wouldn't have had any problem with them. No first rate military considers armed drones to be any more of a threat than conventional manned aircraft. The biggest takeaway here is that cheap armed drones are impossible for *third-rate* militaries, even with air defence systems, to effectively deal with, as they can't afford air power.",,/r/europe/comments/jsm11m/conditions_of_the_armeniaazerbaijan_peace_deal/gc2jq61/,RamTank,1605205658

It's like thinking British people have to be proud of their colonial past or that Americans need to be proud of killing Natives because they are from that country. Anyone who's not from Germany who wants to be a Nazi is right on par with a German who wants to be a Nazi - both were hated by the Nazis. Nazis were committing atrocities against their own people before they could take it outside, and a lot of ideas were just institutional commonplaces - like not taking care of the disabled.

Thinking that people of non-old Nazi territories can be reasoned with if they just realized where they were from is quaint, modern liberal thinking that reduces it too much. What this man likely wants was never contained to just Nazi Germany or territories - but they go with the best brand there is for effect. Those who don't end up making nationalist movements anyway but it's not like there's any better ground.

Fighting stupid people is not how you get smart people. We are not that different. 

Human brain is very adaptable. Intelligence is &lt;=50% inherited and &gt;=50% acquired. So raising your children well and giving them good education (at home and in school) is sufficient to ensure that they are smart. 

The society on its part needs to help with education and with promoting intelligence as a value. 

Our current global media culture is too distorted toward being noticed by any means. So it is plagued by anti-intellectualism, thanks to its shock value and ease of consumption.

1003,"\&gt;  Well, first the party name doesn't say anything. By that logic North Korea would be democratic. 

I already mentioned why the Nazi Party was NOT far right in my opening paragraph. The naming convention merely serves to illustrate my opening points. 

\&gt;And the Nazis weren't distinctly left or right in economics. They also cooperated with private corporations and privatized several firms. 

Which contradicts your previous point labelling them as far right. So now you're saying they're neither? My point in my previous post is that they are socialist in the fundamentals. 

\&gt; Oh, then how are Merkel and Faymann *similar* to the Nazis? 

Read my previous paragraph closely dipshit which was:

\&gt; Similar to your two 'compassionate' ex and soon to be ex-Fuhrer(s) the National Socialist Party and also members of the European political left had and have a very soft spot for political Islam. 

In other words both your 'leaders' or Fuhrers have and had a tolerance for political Islam namely mass immigration and benign ignorance of Saudi and Turkish mosques in both Germany and Austria being incompatible with the political values of those two countries. Kurz is dealing with this now. Obviously you are ignorant of the news in your own country. Astounding.

\&gt; Birthrates will stay higher than average for Muslims, yes, but they will decrease and not stay on the current level. 

What is the basis of this assertion? Your ass? I get my figures from here:  [https://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/) 

I do not make up my facts.

\&gt; And yes, high birthrates are connected with becoming the majority. You see, the more births there are of a certain group, the more people of this group there will be, therefore they would be more likely to become the majority. 

Correlation is not causation. Immigration is not factored in to the debate. Take Australia for example - very low native birthrate requiring immigration to sustain population and economic growth. Asian Australians have the highest birthrate but there is no causation to becoming the majority since immigration comprises the overwhelming majority of population growth (direct causation). (ABS 2020)

\&gt; And oh the sweet irony of saying ""I only debate on facts"" after insulting me multiple times in a debate.

This is reducing the argument to absurdity. 

&gt; his guy couldn’t possibly be in mid motion of raising his hand from his side to the air to wave normally. 

Nope. I'm saying it's very clear that he's fully extending his arm, with fingers outstretched and thumb tucked in, in a classic neo-Nazi salute pose. That is not how people normally wave. Does that mean he *couldn't possibly* be waving? Of course not. Does that mean he's most likely giving a Nazi salute? Yes.

&gt; You and the OP (and apparently the majority of this sub) have decided to label this person as a Nazi because it stokes your personal passion. This somehow feels like you’re “fighting the good fight” to you I’m sure.

No, I'm saying he's doing a Nazi salute because that's by far the most likely thing going on. Instead of trying to pop-psychology me, why don't you ask yourself why you're desperately clinging to a vanishingly small probability?

[link to the document in Hungarian](https://www.parlament.hu/irom41/13647/13647.pdf)

Article L:

&gt; Marriage is a union between a man and a woman

Article XVI:

&gt; Hungary protects the right of the child to have an identity based on the gender it was born with and makes sure it gets raised based on our country's Christian values

Combine that with [the law of adopting children (in Hungarian only)](https://www.parlament.hu/irom41/13648/13648.pdf), submitted at the same time as the constitution change, which says (article 101) that **the minister** responsible for family affairs can decide on individual cases, with special consideration towards Article XVI of the constitution.

---

In other words, singles can adopt children only if the minister approves it, and the minister needs to make the decision based on Article XVI which says children need to be raised on Christian values (effectively banning gay people from adopting).",Vojvodina,/r/europe/comments/jstat5/hungary_proposes_ban_on_adoption_for_samesex/gc1opdq/,flyingorange,1605190894

So in the same vein as people being passionately anti-Trump, it’s only natural that he’ll gain supporters in Europe too. The faux outrage about him having supporters here, while championing anyone who hates him, feels inconsistent. Some people will like what he stands for and some won’t.

I’ve seen graffiti all over Europe that is anti-Trump in nature. What’s so shocking about someone having a flag of support then? Do we expect that Europe will only have people who hate him? Or do we only want to act as if openly hating him is the “normal” / allowed stance?

1197,"Well, behaving within the frames of a ""terrible country"" we are essentially taking the same near-nationalist position. I suggest not to use such definitions. Turkey is the same country as any other, but its political elite at the moment puts the question of its standing in power above everything else and resorting to these unworthy methods like nationalism, religion, and dividing the people into ""good guys"" and ""absolytely wrong"".  


Bts, the last point is very widely used in the Western world too. The habit of dividing things into ""black and white"" has been with us in politics for decades.

&amp;#x200B;

Many authoritarian governments resort to this, but this is a temporary phenomenon cultivated by the current elites and we should not be answered with hatred in response to hatred. All that we can achieve in such ways will be only increased hatred. This is irrational and if you condemn Turkish nationalism and ""exclusivity"", then trying to feel higher than them is also a manifestation of ""exclusivity.""",Europe,/r/europe/comments/jsm11m/conditions_of_the_armeniaazerbaijan_peace_deal/gc1eddc/,B1sher,1605183877

To make where I am coming from more clear: I am very much of the opinion that the means have to match the ends, and I also do not thing that any progress we made in the last few decades is at all secure and therefore using incompatible means paves the way for the reaction to rise to power more easily (due to reduced social reflexes).",Cyprus (self-isolating in DE 🇩🇪),/r/europe/comments/jsrlya/norway_outlaws_hate_speech_against_trans_and/gc1edjr/,agrammatic,1605183881

IIRC The Emperor needed the Bundesrat's consent to declare a war, and the Reichstag's consent to pass budgets. The German Empire would not have gone to war without it's civilian government agreeing to it and cooperating.

By the time the war got into full swing, the government had also pretty much been taken over by the Military. The likes of Ludendorff and Hindenburg obviously proclaimed themselves loyal subjects of the Emperor (and identified as royalists after the war), but they were running the show and simply keeping him informed about matters which they had already decided.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/js3jak/on_this_day_102_years_ago_11th_of_november_1918/gc0oexv/,SeleucusNikator1,1605162898

1. Even if those Greeks with degrees return to Greece and enjoy a tax break of 50%, they will still get almost half or even more than half less than what they get abroad (and work in shittier conditions, for example doctors will have to work in shitty hospitals with worse material etc.) (architects and engineers will have to work in a country with shitty infrastructure, just take a look at how the houses and appartments are built in Greece and the sidewalks). And considering the fact that these people are used to living in the West which is more developed and the people more educated on average, why on ear th would they want to return to their small city with uneducated people who will not have the same midset, and if they move to Athens which generally closer to the West that will just further the problem we already had called centralization.

1- Putin does not like the current Armenian government. AFAIK, the previous government was highly corrupt and most of the officials were basically Putin puppets. Pashinyan was systematically removing those officials and replacing them with those who were closer to EU and US. There was a real discussion about changing the country's external politics away from Russia and towards EU. Putin does not want a country who stands between Russia and Iran and is strategically important.

2- I don't know much about the history, and it is a mess anyways, but those lands officially belongs to Azerbaijan. Look up ""Madrid Principles"" for more info on this. Russia's position on this conflict was that they would support Armenia in a defensive war; but the conflict was happening in NK and hence deemed as an Armenian offensive war. Even though the 2020 conflict was started by Azerbaijan, it was a defensive war.

Of course I am simplifying but Armenia should have seen this coming. Putin had both the motives and the means to abandon Armenia in any conflict related to NK. This was not a secret.

Actually there clearly is. The very idea of secularism is the separation of Church and State with regards to the running of the nation. Whereby the Church should not have influence over policy. It was never meant to be a system that prevents a person's religious freedoms. As is the case in most Secular Western nations. However France has gone well beyond the founding principles and therefore has gone to EXTREMES whereby any physical manifestation of faith or religion is seen as a direct threat to French secularism. If this is not extreme then I do not know what is. It is very similar to Ataturks policies except he went even more extreme and had people executed for simply wearing a Fez.

1518,"Your point on automation is something I did it consider and has great merit, however I think as a whole the gradual aging of population as opposed to a continuously young one is a net negative. An equilibrium must be found somehow, whether through government or societal change. As you said, a young nation must continue to rapidly increase population to stay young, and the opposite applies to an aging nation, the decrease which may start as a gradual will continue to gain speed as fewer people in a society are of an age to have children, as displayed by a demographic pyramid (an upside down one in this case). What I advocate for is not a result of a corporatist conspiracy or fear mongering, but genuine concern for a phenomenon (late stage demographic transition) which has never before happened in human history. Not once before now and the past few decades proceeding today has any so notable a section of the human population actively decreased as a result of not war, famine, or disease, but from lack of reproduction. An economy at the level of the ones found within (western) Europe can not sustain itself without either support of or the active homeland engagement of a physically producing society(producing physical goods, manufacture, agriculture, etc. rather than the service based one which predominates in more advanced economies), which as of right now only exists in semi developed nations with large young worker bases such as India, China (a decade ago maybe, but now they too face a demographic catastrophe which is self inflicted and arguably far more severe than the one we in the west face), and Central American nations. I definitely realize the future contains many unknowingly detrimental developments such as resource scarcity and overpopulation, but if these are the issues avoided in Europe and its periphery by a declining population, an equally dire situation will be reaped as a consequence. As of right now populations which are either currently or soon to be dramatically increasing or decreasing will not be sustainable in the future, and balance must be found. Just as nations in Africa find themselves wrestling with issues of overpopulation and vast swaths of said population being too young to be economically and societally useful, Europe faces a similar but polar issue of large, unproductive populations emerging which even at greatest efficiency can not be supported at a greater ratio than currently with a maintenance of similar quality of life. Unlike the young population however, old, top heavy  populations can not be balanced out naturally (the natural decrease in birth rate being the path down which the young society will follow) and will have their demographic issues continually exasperated without proper intervention. 
A population which starts to decrease will continue to decrease, and without the economic leverage it once had will be unable to sustain its current lifestyle in an increasingly hostile and competitive world.",,/r/europe/comments/jrgw76/europes_median_total_fertility_rate_at_nuts3_level/gc0cbm3/,swikade69,1605155563

Occupiers trying to discredit and delegitimize the resistance movement of the people they occupy, what else is new? 

The matter of fact is that terrorism was a pretty vague concept already two decades ago, and since then it has only become vaguer. That's why not even most governments have ""that one"" definition of ""terrorism"". In [the US for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_terrorism#United_States) every government agency has its own definition of it.

At this point, it's just euphemism for ""people we don't like"" while at the same time glorifying common **criminals** as being way more dangerous than they actually are.

I am extremely aware of what Freedom of Speech means. For example in the US, you can question the Holocaust, you could always insult the President, insult the flag and national anthem. You would he hated for it but you have the FREEDOM to do it. 

France does NOT have Freedom of Speech for all the above mentioned reasons. France in their EXTREMIST SECULAR views only allow Free speech that suits them and do not allow anything that opposes what they deem as French Values. That is LIMITED Free Speech. Now since you are so obsessed with Turkey then we can go on and say that Turkey also has limited Free Speech. Neither country has true Free Speech. So the only difference is how much limitations they put on their own people. Seems rather hypocritically of France (A nation with Limited Free Speech) to point their finger at Turkey and say 'You are limiting Freedom of Speech'. It is like a tragic comedy. So it is pure French arrogance that leads them to believe that they have a right to tell Turkey how much 'Limitations' are and aren't allowed. 

At least the US has a consistent leg to stand on. Like it or not but they aren't hypocritical. They are consistent in upholding their values of Free Speech. Unlike France.",,/r/europe/comments/jshfas/turkish_man_ismail_demirbas_arrested_after/gc01bs3/,no-bs10,1605148897

Hypocrisy from whom? Where did France or  french ever denied selling weapons? You are a fucking moron...


&gt;Russia and China sell weapons also but what they DON'T do is claim that they won't sell to one nation because of ethics with regards to human rights violations whilst selling weapons to other human rights abusers. 

So that make them better in your POV? Invading Ukraine and the opression of the uygurs in China don't matter ? Lol

And since you have nothing more to say you are calling me an Nationalist (biggest joke ever)


So let me get this straight.... You said tjat

1- France is bad because they sell weapons in India oBviIuSly They are evil

2-USA is far more tolerant than us while czling franxe extreme securalist


3-  that WE are hypocrite despite showing nothing that prove that  France dened seling weapons

False. That is a gross lie. Also the fact that it is a crime to insult the French flag fits your description anyway. 


""USA had racial segregation just 50 years and their own media are full false propaganda.""

France was still committing a genocide in Algeria until 1962. They used chemical weapons, rape, torture and mass murder to occupy it. As admitted to by Macron himself but he refused to apologise for it as he said 'We cannot be stuck in the past'. Such a convenient excuse to get yourself out of responsibility. Imagine claiming that the French media is also not full of propaganda. That is literally what the media is. It is propaganda. Every country in the world does it. 




""And you just mentionned USA a comment ago...""

Well actually the US is nowhere near as extreme as France. They give Freedom to people to embrace their faith and wear whatever they want to wear. A person can wear a cross around their neck whilst working in a govement office. A women can wear a hijab to the beach without being forced to take it off, unlike in France.

1693,"&gt;What happens when there is one tax paying worker for every two pensioners? When there three or four? Five? 

How about 100 ?

I don't think you understand the term ""GRADUAL"" !!!!

Or maybe you don't know old people eventually die.

Again, I am talking about a gradual decrease in population. A small negative population growth, if maintained over time, will result in smaller population and there will be no fuckin collapse.

**Look at the unemployment rate for young people all over Europe. It's worryingly high.**

Now consider that a decrease in population will initially not result in fewer people paying taxes, but in less unemployment benefits being paid. 

The unemployment will go down to manageable rates.

**High unemployment leads to social unrest.** 

That is something that you have to be very careful with. I don't think you want social unrest and extremism, especially not in countries with nukes.

**Automation will lead to further job losses**

Which will mean higher unemployment, which would just be compounded by an increasing population. 

What do you think happens if unemployment reaches 25% or 30% ?

What happens if the state can't give all those people enough money so they don't starve to death ?

&gt;How can this region continually compete economically once the rest of the world furthers its demographic transition and becomes as productive per person as Europe?

Compete from what standpoint ?

What you want is efficiency, not raw numbers. 

Countries with small populations, like Switzerland or Luxembourg are doing great. They don't need to have a GDP larger than China. They focus on innovation, high quality products that have big margins. 

What you want is not have a giant GDP and have the standard of living like India, you want a high GDP/capita and the standard of living like Switzerland or Norway.

&gt;if South Koreans continue their demographic path, they will become literally extinct by 2700

It's ok, will start a program to breed them in captivity, and then release them in the wild.

Jokes aside, I hope you realize that's stupid. No region in the world will just become empty. One way or another, people will live there.

What you just said is like saying: a child was born 50 cm long and grew 25 cm in his first year, so by the time he's 40, his height will be 10.5m

&gt;I don’t understand what I fail to recognize in order to become convinced of a elderly only society.

You fail to recognize that: 

1. We're not talking about an ""elderly only"" society. That's stupid. I am not talking about killing all the young people
2. You are regurgitating things that you heard/read in the media, that are IMO pushed by corporations who need a continually growing population as a continually growing customer base, so they can keep growing themselves - this is driven by the fact that a company just being stable is not enough for investors these days, it has to keep growing, and it has to accelerate its growth - which just can't happen all the time
3. You ignore other forces/factors, like growing unemployment and its social risks, and exploding automation and its consequences
4. You are basically fear-mongering or you bought into the fear-mongering
5. You ignore what should be the main goal of an economy: offering the best possible life for the people living under that system. The goal of an economy is not to have to biggest raw GDP in the world.  That means nothing if at the same time the quality of life is shit, people have little to no social protections, die from curable diseases, many are homeless, the wealth inequality is sky high, and society is crumbling and the country is turning fascist or already fascist",,/r/europe/comments/jrgw76/europes_median_total_fertility_rate_at_nuts3_level/gc04ml9/,deponent,1605150806

1702,"&gt;Turkey has 2 proxy wars going on right now

Syria, Libya, Azerbaijan, Iraq and wherever the hell Erdogan finds Kurds *next* week.

&gt;One can argue and would be factually right about Turkish intervention in Syria against the Assad regime is widely supported by Western nations because first it’s destabilizing a Russian satellite country which is also supported by Iran

One could argue that and be a wrong. The West made it clear from the first day that Turkey’s invasion flew right in the face of its efforts in Syria. It specifically targeted NATO’s Kurdish allies and employed Islamist factions, as if more of those were needed. Turkish units have even shelled American outposts in Syria.

The fact that the West and Russia are at odds over Georgia, Ukraine and other matters doesn’t mean its in our interest to go out in the world and punch Russians wherever we find them. Turkey’s Syrian intervention only completely pointlessly provokes Russia and makes Syria even more dependent on it.

&gt;because it’s stopping a second refugee wave across Europe (mind you Turkey hosts around 5 millions of Syrians).

Patently false, Turkey can manage that just fine without invading Syria. Creating an occupied zone in Syria to store Syrian refugees in may help alleviate that problem *for Turkey* in the short run, but it obviously doesn’t contribute to ending the war.

&gt;they’re also doesn’t want a Kurdish statelet that undeniably has seperatist and revolutionary tendencies on her border, this group called YPG has nothing to do with Western interests if they’re not actually planning to use them against Turkey someday.

There’s this thing called the right to self determination. You should look it up.

And the YPG has fought alongside Western forces for nearly 20 years non stop in Iraq, and in Syria for as long as ISIS has existed.

Turkey on the other hand has repeatedly bombed the YPG and driven them off in both countries, while doing nothing against neither AQI nor ISIS.

&gt;Albeit one of the reasons of Turkish involvement in Libya is in fact their conflict with Greece

What’s Turkish for *mare nostrum?*

&gt;they’re also again fighting against the influence of Russia which seems to be working some kind of a deal with Haftar (who knows, it might be a millitary base or something different), i suppose you would know that this Haftar guy also gets insane amount of support from both Saudi Arabia and UAE

I frankly cannot keep track on how many nations Haftar is working for according to Turkish users in this sub. One day it’s France, the next it’s Russia, then it’s Saudi Arabia and the UAE. I guess by next week it’ll be Hungary and Israel?

&gt;they’ve also financed tons of mosques inside Europe which were a breeding ground for radical islamism

Turkey also does that. Please stop doing it.

&gt;they hate Turkey because Turks supports Muslim Brotherhood (a group that i deeply hate)

Fair enough, can’t disagree on that one.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If you think that Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran is more trustworthy than your 60 year ally it’s a whole another story, enlighten us about how Russians should be supported against a NATO member Turkey in Libya. (Well France already kinda does that.)

i will slightly address this, though. most eurozone economies are already considered developed, it is hard for them to grow fast. outside of the eurozone, you have really young economies with immense potential (such as poland and romania) that also have the benefit of being in the EU, which means they are considered to be very stable. this makes them incredibly attractive to investors, and, say, €1B will yield a greater return in poland than it will in germany. don’t forget that those investments are still made in euros though. even though those countries don’t use euro as an official currency, cars are still bought in euros, some salaries are still paid in euros. hell, in romania even phone plans are in euros. sure, that money may get converted into the local currency somewhere down the line, but you will have to use euros when you do business in europe.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/jsclzt/croatia_aims_to_adopt_the_euro_as_its_currency_on/gbzm6ea/,bogdoomy,1605141005

1742,"&gt;Lowering consumption of goods will be necessary if we are to meet our climate target of &lt;2°C.

Consumption of resources yes, not necessarily of functionality. But from a policy POV it doesn't matter, as long as the resource use goes down, and the incentives to get there are the same.

&gt;I don't know if you've already gone on one of those carbon footprint simulator websites, but even if we assume some magical 0gCO2/kWh electricity grid, the 2°C target isn't met in our countries without other, drastic restrictions. And said restrictions get tighter and tighter by the day as we waste away our remaining carbon allowance...

Sure, electricity is just the warming up.

1762,"&gt; If that were the case, Germany's 2030 pathway wouldn't be so pitiful. Germany clearly has the funds to spend on such a ""cheap"" and ""fast"" transition.

Those pathways include current known projects. It does not account for delays, or projects that are started and completed between now and 2030.

&gt;Hahaha, of course, we should all be thankful for Germany, who spews all sorts of pollutants and carcinogens (not to mention radioactive ashes) with their crappy lignite plants.
If renewables are so cheap ""thanks to you"" (of course, countries like China, which are the main producers of renewable in the world, don't deserve any credit), then achieve something better than a pathetic 230gCO2/kWh by 2030. Then we'll be thankful.

Much of the price decrease was due to the implementation of mass production, which would not have happened without commitment of a major user. Then once the production is ongoing, it becomes attractive to invest in R&amp;D to increase efficiency, and the ball starts rolling.

&gt;Are you seriously blaming nuclear for not ""pushing away"" German coal, as if it were their responsibility? What a joke.

I'm not blaming them. I'm mostly using it as an illustration that it wasn't easy to push coal away in Germany.

Trump is down 1,655,192 to 1,642,379 in Arizona. There are some outstanding ballots but he'd have to win 64% of them which is statistically unlikely since even good drops for Trump have been around 56%. 

&gt; is projected to win in Georgia during the recount

Trump is down 2,471,906 to 2,457,794 in Georgia. Recounts usually only flip a few hundred votes. (And might not flip them in Trump's direction.)

&gt; will most likely flip PA by legal means removing spoiled ballots.

Doubtful. Trump is down 3,376,950 to 3,328,154 in Pennsylvania. Trump's attorney admitted that there's no evidence of fraud.

&gt; I don't know about MI, but the largest amount of evidence of fraud has been in MI. 

The ones that have been recanted under oath?

&gt;I don't know what alternate reality you live in where there is no path to victory. That's just false. 

Reread this sentence and compare it to the actual vote counts. 

When Trump leaves office on January 20th, I recommend you find more reliable sources of information than you currently use, since they're manipulating and misinforming you.

Please provide us with your news sources so I can do the same if Trump *does* start his second term on January 20th.

Once that's the status quo the UK then begins its own customs enforcement and tries to negotiate from a stronger position.

1843,"Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, has claimed that Britain is struggling to conclude a trade deal with his country before the Brexit transition ends on January 1 because it does not have “the bandwidth”.

Mr Trudeau said Canada was highly experienced at striking trade deals and was ready to conclude an agreement with the UK, rolling over the terms of the existing EU-Canada deal when the transition period ends.

“The UK hasn’t had to negotiate trade deals in the past few decades,” Mr Trudeau told the Financial Times. “So there is an issue of not really having the bandwidth within government to move forward on this.”


Liz Truss, Britain’s international trade secretary, denies that Britain does not have enough capacity or trade negotiators to do a deal, and her allies say she hopes to get an agreement across the line by January 1.

“We’re firing on all cylinders,” said one aide. “We’ve got more than 700 staff in our trade policy group, which is considerably more than the Office of the US Trade Representative.”

Canada’s a really easy [trade deal]. We’re there for it. We’d like to do it.

Justin Trudeau
Britain currently trades with Canada under the terms of the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement signed by Mr Trudeau in 2016, which removed most tariffs on trade.

Unless the Ceta terms are rolled over, trade between Britain and Canada will revert to “lowest common denominator” World Trade Organization terms, with new tariffs and barriers to trade, on January 1.

Britain is Canada’s fifth biggest trading partner after the US, China, Mexico and Japan, with over US$20bn of bilateral trade in 2017. Securing a deal before January 1 is important for both countries.

Mr Trudeau told the FT Global Boardroom conference on Wednesday that the two countries were “on the edge of having an agreement” but said that “one of the challenges is bandwidth”.

He said Canada had a free trade deal with every other G7 country, along with a free trade deal in North America and treaties with countries around the Pacific Rim. “We know how to negotiate trade deals,” he said.

Mr Trudeau said he offered some of his country’s expertise to Britain, which had not had to negotiate any trade deals since it became a member of the EU in 1973 because Brussels ran commercial policy.

“I know that rolling over and demonstrating free trade deals for the UK government is extremely important,” he said.

“Canada’s a really easy one. We’re there for it. We’d like to do it. So I’m very hopeful that it’s going to get done but that really is up to the UK government because we’re there for it.”


Justin Trudeau speaks to FT editor about working with Joe Biden
Ms Truss recently concluded a trade deal with Japan and has rolled over all but about a dozen EU trade agreements: Canada is the biggest outstanding one, along with Mexico, Vietnam and Egypt.

“The core elements of the deal are agreed, there’s just a few things to iron out,” said an aide to Ms Truss. “We’ve made some very reasonable offers to the Canadians.

“The ball is in their court probably more than it is in ours. A deal is there to be done. Bandwidth isn’t an issue at all.”

2092,"No they didn't. They gave their lives for the interests of some cozy elite that didn't have to fight themselves in the war, and they did so because they were lied to that the war was a necessity for their country by those same elites.

Here, from *All Quiet on the Western Front*, written by an actual WW1 veteran:

&gt; ""It's queer, when one thinks about it,"" goes on Kropp, ""we are here to protect
our fatherland. And the French are over there to protect their fatherland. Now who's in the right?""

&gt;""Perhaps both,"" say I without believing it.

&gt;""Yes, well now,"" pursues Albert, and I see that he means to drive me into a
corner, ""but our professors and parsons and newspapers say that we are the only ones that are right, and let's hope so;--but the French professors and parsons and newspapers say that the right is on their side, now what about that?""

&gt;""That I don't know,"" I say, ""but whichever way it is there's war all the same and every month more countries coming in.""

&gt;Tjaden reappears. He is still quite excited and again joins the conversation, wondering just how a war gets started.

&gt;""Mostly by one country badly offending another,"" answers Albert with a slight air of superiority.

&gt;Then Tjaden pretends to be obtuse. ""A country? I don't follow. A mountain in Germany cannot offend a mountain in France. Or a river, or a wood, or a ﬁeld of wheat.""

&gt;""Are you really as stupid as that, or are you just pulling my leg?"" growls Kropp, ""I don't mean that at all. One people offends the other--""

&gt;""Then I haven't any business here at all,"" replies Tjaden, ""I don't feel myself offended.""

&gt;""Well, let me tell you,"" says Albert sourly, ""it doesn't apply to tramps like you.""

&gt;""Then I can be going home right away,"" retorts Tjaden, and we all laugh, ""Ach, man! he means the people as a whole, the State--"" exclaims Müller.

&gt;""State, State""--Tjaden snaps his ﬁngers contemptuously, ""Gendarmes, police, taxes, that's your State;--if that's what you are talking about, no, thank you.""

&gt; ""That's right,"" says Kat, ""you've said something for once, Tjaden. State and home-country, there's a big difference."" ""But they go together,"" insists Kropp, ""without the State there wouldn't be any
home-country.""

&gt;""True, but just you consider, almost all of us are simple folk. And in France, too, the majority of men are labourers, workmen, or poor clerks. Now just why would a French blacksmith or a French shoemaker want to attack us? No, it is merely the rulers. I had never seen a Frenchman before I came here, and it will be just the same with the majority of Frenchmen as regards us. They weren't asked about it any more than we were.""

&gt;""Then what exactly is the war for?"" asks Tjaden.

&gt;Kat shrugs his shoulders. ""There must be some people to whom the war is useful.""

Sorting out moving it is is a fairly minor issue. I've transported medicines on normal curtainsiders between manufacturer and pharmaceutical wholesaler that needed to be kept to a specific temperature and that was done with a specialised pallet sized container with its own integral power supply and temperature logging. Basically if you can already make something that it can be stored in, which Pfizer and many other places already have, you can create a portable version of that. You don't need specific hubs either.

2122,"&gt;Small countries always have to rely more on trade because their internal buffers are smaller. That is quite logical. If we cut France in Denmark-sized pieces the dependency will be even higher.

So Denmark is too small a country to be used as an example of transition to renewable on a large scale. That's like saying a city next to a hydro plant is an example of how you can transition to 100% renewable.

Looking at large countries like France or Germany would be more appropriate to study policies that approach grid-scale.

&gt;That being said, looking at Europe as a whole favors renewables because the weather and seasonal variability for solar and wind across the whole continent is substantially smaller than those of a single country.

Smaller, but not nearly small enough to have something approaching base-load, let alone dispatchable power. Lesser variability doesn't compensate for the lack of export/import capability that you get from looking at the whole grid.

Also, if you want to be able to use Spanish solar to power Polish homes, you're gonna need a much sturdier European grid and interconnections.

&gt;Likewise, France's model can't be applied everwhere either, because it *also* relies on a big fraction of hydro power and the large number of plants to produce some flexibility. Wouldn't work in countries that are smaller or have less hydro, for example Belgium was about as committed to nuclear and they never did better than 60% nuclear and 40% fossil.

I don't even advocate for exporting France's model literally everywhere either. I simply oppose dogmatic belief in the idea that we can go carbon-free without nuclear playing any part at all, despite expert panels like the IPCC showing that it needs to be part of the toolset used against climate change.

60% nuclear and 40% fossil is still better than 100% fossil, especially if in the former case you use less CO2-intensive fossil fuels like gas instead of coal. That being said, if storage technology is to become as affordable as you claim, then there shouldn't be any issue with going 60% nuclear + 40% renewable.

&gt;And really, in 1950 nuclear power didn't exist, so by that reasoning it would never have been built either.

Didn't say no renewable capacity should be built. It simply isn't sufficient on its own given current technology.

&gt;There are more constraints, their coal sector has been favoured politically for a long time, because they're important employers in Eastern Germany. That's not a good reason, but it happens.

That looks like a good excuse on paper, until you think about it. If renewable was as cheap as you portray it to be, then there should already be enough at this point for there to be no room nor need for burning coal to generate power. That's evidently not the case, and given projections (230gCO2/kWh in 2030), that's still not going to be the case in 10 years.

&gt;And yes, Germany kickstarted the thing and 20 years ago the price was still quite a bit higher. The same budget spent on today's prices would be quite different.

Then go ahead and get rid of fossil-fuel generated electricity in less than 10 years. If it's as easy and cheap as you make it out to be, then it should be a piece of cake.

&gt;Besides, both Germany and France's emissions are now on the per capital level slightly below that of the 1960s. In that regard they're equally succesful now.

We're talking about grid carbon density here, not emissions per capita. Please don't mix things up.

When it comes to grid carbon density, Germany is not equally successful to France, not by a long shot.

&gt;Which, again, has more to do with their lucky happenstance of having hydro up to their nose that takes care of the load balancing in a clean way so their NPPs can run at full efficiency, making the costs bearable.

You don't need hydro for NPPs to run at full efficiency. To be at full efficiency, NPPs need to be run as base load. This is not any more of a drawback than intermittence.",,/r/europe/comments/js5kf7/the_most_carbonemitting_power_grids_in_eu27_based/gby3qpi/,Perett2822120,1605111745

Not really directly comparable, to read your text messages a criminal would have to clone your SIM card and read them as they’re sent, with messenger apps once they’re in they can read your entire messaging history at their leisure.

They are indeed. Even calling it a ""science"" is such a joke, seeing as how there's absolutely nothing scientific about it - just a label to try and give the field credibility.

&gt;if you find it too difficult to give different meanings to the same word depending on context thats not their fault im afraid.

No, not at all - I find it silly when we already have 10 words to describe something and a group of morons decide to take a term that means the *direct opposite of what they are describing*.

It's lazy and idiotic.

""Oppressed group"" would literally describe the exact same thing without being an oxymoron and twisting the meaning of the very specific word: ""minority""

&gt;the opposite of ""minority"", in this context not ""majority"" but rather ""dominant group"".

You're literally proving my point about what a joke the field is.

They can't even stick to opposites. So instead of having ""Subordinate group"", ""submissive group"" or even ""non-dominant group"" they chose to grab a word, completely flip its meaning, then instead of choosing the opposite word for the opposite definition they pick something completely different.

&gt;one group earning more or voting more doesnt make them a dominant group until they actively keep other groups subordinate (if you think asian americans do that, please provide evidence)

Mate, it's 2020. If that's your definition then women are absolutely not a ""minority"" group.

2588,"The chanson (song) de Craonne, written by an anonymus grunt in the French army: 



When after eight days, the rest over

We go take back the trenches,

Our place is so useful

That without us we'd get crushed

But that's over, we've had enough

No one wants to march any more

And with a heavy heart, as if in a weep

We say farewell to civvies

Even without drums, even without trumpets

We climb up there, keeping our heads down

 

- Chorus :

Farewell to life, farewell to love,

Farewell to all women

It's all over, it's forever

For this infamous war

It's at Craonne on the plateau

That we must kick the bucket

Because we're all condemned

We're the sacrificed

 

Eight days of trench, eight days of suffering

But we still have hope

That tonight will come the relief

That we're waiting without truce

Suddenly in the night and in silence

We see someone approaching

That's an officer of rifles

Who comes to replace us

Softly in the shadow under the falling rain

The little rifles are looking for their graves

 

- Chorus

 

It's sad to see on the main boulevards

All these fat ones partying

If for them life is great

For us, it's not the same thing

Instead of hiding, all these shirkers

Had better climb to the trenches

To defend their ownings, for we own nothing

We the poor miserous

All the comrades are buried there

To defend the ownings of these gentlemen

 

- Chorus :

Those who've got the dough, they'll come back

For it's for them we die

But it's over, because the soldiers

Will all go on strike

It'll be your turn, fat gentlemen

To climb on the plateau

For if you want to do war

Pay it with your own blood

Bogus claims to discredit our Turkic heritage and curtail panturkism.

2793,"Road transport continues to have the largest share of EU freight transport performance among the three inland transport modes. In 2018, road transport accounted for three-quarters (75.3 %) of the total inland freight transport (based on tonne-kilometres performed). This share increased by 0.1 percentage points (pp) compared with the previous year. Rail transport accounted for 18.7 % of the EU total, slightly higher than the previous year (+0.4 pp), while the share of inland waterways was 6.0 % of the total inland transport performance.

The modal split at country level varies considerably. In particular, the modal split obviously depends on the availability of a given mode. Only 17 of the Member States report freight data on inland waterways. In particular, Cyprus and Malta do not have either railways or navigable inland waterways; thus, for these two Member States the share of road freight transport is 100 % by default. 

In 2018, road transport was the main inland transport mode used in all EU Member States with the exception of Lithuania and Latvia, where it represented 32.1 % and 24.2 % of total inland freight transport, respectively. In those two countries, rail transport was the main inland transport mode used in 2018 with shares of 75.8 % in Latvia and 67.9 % in Lithuania. Rail also played a major role in the other Baltic Member State, Estonia, with a share of 46.2 % in 2018. In 2018, road transport accounted for more than 70 % of inland freight transport in 16 Member States and more than 90 % in Ireland, Greece and Spain. The share of inland waterways was the highest in the Netherlands (43.2 %). High shares were also recorded in Romania (27.1 %), Bulgaria (24.5 %) and Belgium (16.1 %).

School hours are ~4 hours for kindergarten and 9-2 for elementary school here vs 8-4 in Hungary in the early 90s. You can’t have a full time job with those hours.

Also a major reason American women in their 50s and 60s retire is to take care of their new grandkids.

&gt; he was extradited on August 31, 2012 to Azerbaijan, where he was greeted as a hero,[1][2][3] pardoned by Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev despite contrary assurances made to Hungary,[4] promoted to the rank of major and given an apartment and over eight years of back pay.

This document presents the Ifop questionnaire submitted to our representative sample of the population residing in metropolitan France - 15,459 people aged 15 and over were questioned -, from which a specific sample of Muslims or of Muslim culture was extracted; they represent 1,029 individuals, of which 874 define themselves as ""Muslims"".
 
This survey was carried out from April 13 to May 23, 2016. Interviews were conducted by telephone. The representativeness of the overall sample was ensured by the quota method with regard to:
• socio-demographic criteria (sex of the individual, age of the individual);
• socio-professional criteria (individual's profession);
• geographic criteria (administrative region, size of urban unit, proportion of immigrants in the municipality or district (IRIS) of residence);
• civic criteria (nationality).

Never said they had an ""obligation"". That's not international politics works. 

Good allies help each other, within reason. I would say helping the Armenians protect their people in Karabakh is within reason. Armenia will be badly damaged for years or decades by this conflict, how is it unreasonable for them to ask for help from their ""ally""?

&gt; And certainly Russia has no obligation to send its troops to annex land for Armenia, especially when Armenia has not even sent its own troops to do so.

Did you ignore everything I wrote? It's not necessary for Russia to help Armenia annex everything. You're just repeating yourself ad nauseum.

And yes, Armenia sent its own troops. Saying otherwise is propaganda.

&gt; On both counts it was done to protect Russian nationals there from a revolution in Ukraine

Oh, not this again. There was no serious threat to ethnic Russians in Ukraine. The interim government even vetoed efforts to remove Russian as the official language. On the contrary, Russia made anti-Russian sentiment in the country, much, much worse with their invasion. The invasion was not done to ""protect Russian nationals"", that's propaganda bullshit to sell the war to Russians and foolish sympathizers in the West.

As for the rest, I don't have time to respond to your entire anti-American spiel. I've seen it a million times, you just condemn any foreign intervention by the US without regards to the context.

Russia has no obligations to support Karabah separatism from Azerbaijan. And certainly Russia has no obligation to send its troops to annex land for Armenia, especially when Armenia has not even sent its own troops to do so.

Russia broke international law by threatening to use force in Crimea and actually using force in Donbas. On both counts it was done to protect Russian nationals there from a revolution in Ukraine, a neighbouring country, which they did not support. For its breach of international law, Russia was heavily sanctioned.

Whom was USA protecting in Yugoslavia? In Iraq? In Libya? Whom was USA arming in Syria? In Afghanistan in the 80s? In Iran? These places are on the other side of the world and had no relevance to USA. Where are the sanctions against USA for it's consistent disregard for international law. Where is the condemnation for the killing of over a million Arabs in the recent years? Where are the cries about genocide of Arabs?

I am not even mentioning other US adventures in Cuba, Nicaragua etc, at least those are closer to USA borders. Speaking of borders, USA is quick to condemn and bomb anyone in the middle east if they dare to pacify armed revolts in their own countries.

A bit misleading. Armenian population in the green area accounted to less than 1%. Peace is achieved before Azerbaijan went too in to NK.

&gt;This is a bit like the people who describe destroying Israel and expelling all the Jews as “liberation” because Arabs used to live there.

Nobody is being expelled just becuase we call it liberation.

&gt;So whose rightful claim is it? How far back to we keep playing the sick game of “this land is our rightful clay, so we’re within our rights to take it and expel the people living there”? It should be obvious that this is a vicious cycle.

I don't get how did you reached to the conclusion where anybody is expelled or liberation means expelling anybody its just a word people use for removal of occupation it ain't that deep.

2. make contact to foreign nations or other individuals or institutions that align with your goal of removing the current leader and promise them to do so in exchange for (financial) support by them.

3267,"You obviously did not understand the ""culture **starts**"". I'm not saying people should eat the same thing all the time. I'm saying the basics of culture stems from language, food, clothing, it's the most BASIC stuff, then social customs, and then in higher spheres it's about values etc... 

Saying language is hardly a custom IS profundly stupid, because any society relies on the commodity and community of language. As a greek you should know about it, since even though they were city-states, the hellenic peoples had common ground for understanding each other and engage in different common customs such as the olympics. 

I'm not advocating against learning other languages, not at all. But when citizens of the same country don't speak at least one common language, that's generally a problem, also because language determines a certain perception of the world, ideas etc... (which is why learning many languages is a good thing. Some languages lack the world ""to have"" for example). If you're here for more than five years and can't engage in a BASIC conversation (not talking about hard stuff, but small talk), that means you did not try to integrate at all, simple as that, no matter how complicated a language is immersion is the best situation to learn (i've met an iranian girl who learnt french through immersion, able to do small talk, in a span of a MONTH without any previous knowledge), even more so if the local populace is understanding and helpful (such as the greeks i've met were).",,/r/europe/comments/jr5d08/eu_draft_declaration_sets_out_stricter_rules_on/gbuoukz/,CharliCharmant,1605032731

3341,"Wow that's a huge generalisation that's incredibly harmful to suicide and mental health discourse. Suicide attempts are suicide attempts and should all be taken equally seriously.

Besides the biggest argument towards why women don't choose violent methods is because they are concerned for how people might find their bodies and don't want to cause unnecessary distress to their family beyond just their death (which to those who are suffering enough to commit suicide they don't believe their death will even cause that much distress so why make their family clean their brains off the ceiling and inconvenience them even more than they already have) 

It isn't a competition over who's the best at suicide! It's a discussion so that shitty attitudes like ""women don't even try to kill themselves properly it's just for attention"" that's harmful to EVERYONE. Have you ever concerned that this exact discourse is why men choose more violent methods? Because in a world where they're told every waking breath that to be feminine is bad. That even when contemplating death they don't want to be seen as a ""pussy"" or being ""like a women for choosing a half hearted suicide method""

3477,"My point about nationalism was about how this crazy Turk nationalism helps ANY dictator to seize and hold power, not just Erdogan. Its not just Erdogan. The Turkic people not just in Turkey but elsewhere in Europe are crazy nationalistic and that will inevitably help populist and nationalist leaders to rally more support. This whole Ataturk glorification is just one side of this nationalism, he is made out to be some huge exceptional figure that was so special and deserves praise from not just Turkic people, but from everyone.  


After WW1, most of the old monarchist systems broke down and were replaced by many new ethnic nations, most of them looking to chase this same democracy, but were by 20s-30s replaced with dictatorships. Many of them still retained these democratic dreams and ideas, trying to work towards that eventually, but have a ""strong leader"" guide them through the hard times, facing recession, rise of communism, fascism, religion and all those other threats to these young democracies. It wasnt just Ataturk, he really wasnt that special. He is made to be that special, again because there are lot of Turks AND they are crazy nationalistic. Im not saying he is a dictator like Hitler, Stalin, Kims or whatever.. im saying he is dictator like most of the other ""young weak democracies"" had.  


I mean I get what youre trying to say, but my point was as little that ive read about Ataturk doesnt paint him to be a much different of a leader than that of other new European nations of that time. He is a historic figure and definitely pushed Turkey to western values, theres no doubt about it... but its also rather clear he is made out to be a bigger hero that did nothing wrong, pushed by the many Turks on social medias. It all goes hand in hand with denying genocides/massacres most of the times as well. I wouldnt have a problem with people celebrating historic figures from their past, if that didnt also encompass trying to rewrite history. Somehow even the anti-Erdogan Kemalist nationalists seem to be completely against any discussion about these massacres or Kurds and go on to justify them by continuing to vilify the opposition. It all also seemed to be happening more often while there was this whole Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict going on.  


I dont expect you to see my POV or receive any upvotes for what I said, I dont care. I explained my side of the argument as best as I could. If you want to keep praising Ataturk, be my guest, I dont object that as long as it stays logical and truthful, not based on nationalist fantasies and with malicious intent to push narratives.",,/r/europe/comments/jrfaf9/on_this_day_leader_of_the_turkish_national/gbtvlos/,itskarldesigns,1605018577

3560,"Though I'm aware of the assimilation during communism (which started later, during Ceausescu), this is the first time I'm hearing that an assimilation took place during the interwar period. 

I've read impartial historians like the famous Lucian Boia, or even foreign ones, very acknowledged, like Keith Hitchins (*Romania: 1866-1947*), among many others, and I've got to say: never found anything related. Also, I think this must also be the first time I hear a Hungarian saying that an assimilation happened *including* during the interwar period.

But in the end I agree no side is better.

As it regards the reason why they left, especially post-89, I also agree that some leave because of the language. Kids hear only Hungarian during the first 7 years of their lives, before they enroll in school. Parents do not want to teach them Romanian too. That's because of nationalism, fear of assimilation and other bs UDMR serves them everyday, using fears in order to control them and stay relevant. 

Like if you know another language you will suddenly become Romanian and you will lose your identity. I know German and English on a native level, that doesn't make me German or English in the slightest. It just means I know two more foreign languages. 

But it's also because we have them learn Romanian **as a native language**. It would be best to teach them Romanian as a *foreign language*. Luckily, there's been a push for that and I think that idea will be implemented in the near future. I don't know how much success it will have, since learning it as a foreign language doesn't exactly guarantee that they will *actually* learn it. We also learn French as a foreign language here, but 2 hours a week doesn't mean you will get good at it by the 12th grade. 

Finally, granting dual citizenship was also kind of a double-edged sword in that sense. Made it easier for them and kind of encouraged them to leave.","Romania, Transylvania",/r/europe/comments/jr15c6/brasov_romania_the_fog_made_it_look_cinematic/gbtknly/,ArtDoesNotComeEasy,1605011266

My God how many accounts are you going to make? I did see you've posted at r/Serbia and it kinda reminded me of you, but I thought ""No  way"". You know it would actually calm my tits if you told me some of the other Serbs I've argued with were you in disguise XD  



&gt;Okay. The use of force by Russia is predicated on two things:

&gt;A) The interests of the Russian state

&gt;B) International obligations towards their allies

&gt;In this case there were neither.  

 

Yes they were neither but I'm saying that defending their ally not being in the interest of the Russian state is the problem. Well not for me, but if I were Armenian or from some of the other countries that are Russian allies, I'd view it as somewhat of a betrayal.   



&gt;It's not hypocritical, you said that Russia has broken some guarantees, I'm pointing out that they have not, those guarantees still stand.   

Considering Russia has always acted more in line with the spirit of their relationships than the legal letter I do think they've effectively broken them.

3568,"1. Battle of Maraş wasn't really fought by Turkish forces. The French got stuck on a guerilla war with the local population. And as you know, guerilla forces don't really have a command structure to prevent such inhumane acts.  

2. Armenian forces also massacared Turks and Kurds in the area aswell people always seem to look at Turkish atrocities and never look at the things that Armenians and Greek forces did, let alone that they literally occupied a lot of land that belonged to Turks.  

3. During the Greco Turkish war Greek Forces burned down many Turkish villages and massacared many locals. They also pretty much treated Turks like shit. My question is why would we even burn İzmir, a city that we fough to take for 3 years? Would that make any sense at all? Ataturk himself said that they didn't burn İzmir. Although I think that İzmir might have been burnt by the angry Turkish locals that wanted to take revenge from the Greeks, so they took their anger out on the remaining Greek population.  

4. I am pretty sure you mean the Greco Turkish population exchange by ""Thrace Pogroms""  

5. Dersim Massacare wasn't really a massacare but it was more of a revolt. Imagine this, you have been through 2 large scale wars and you have barely survived as a country and then suddenly a large scale revolt breaks out. What will you do? Just let them casually revolt and cause anarchy? Of course in order to protect the country's integrity and unity you go all out.

For example, a country with fewer researchers should have a higher chance of getting less than average results.

So based on a single event that happened in Khojali, the history of oppression and systematic eradication of Armenians is justified?

&gt;Why do you guys keep using the same narrative, portraying Armenians as the ultimate victims, even though there were no good sides in the war?

Well, you obviously have a side. I simply support Armenians in Artshak for the same reason I support Native Americans in their fight. Why should the indigenous population of the region be displaced or massacred, which we saw happen to Armenians over and over again. And why would I support a racist dipshit who openly calls for the eradication of Armenians?

And no one is claiming Armenians are the ultimate victim. They are, like your people or the Jews, have been victimized for most of their history, but the difference is they have never been offered the same level of dignity. I am from Turkey, and Armenians are still treated like dogs.

And the abuse you got from Armenians is not ok, but imagine this. If a random person defended the Nazi invasion of Poland and the Nazi rhetoric against Polish people, based on what bunch of German nationalists told him, what would your reaction be?

And consider this. Your people had at least your empire days and today going somewhere better. My people are witness to what happened to Armenians and I can assure you for the last 1000 years Armenians have known mostly tragedy. Their identity is shaped by grief and with that, comes a lot of anger against the world.",Dersim,/r/europe/comments/jr7pmf/armenian_russian_azerbaijani_leaders_sign/gbtd85s/,cervanto96,1605003815

3647,"&gt;In the second quarter of 2020, the EU household saving rate recorded its highest year-over-year increase since the time series began at +10.8 percentage points (pp).  
&gt;  
&gt;The main reason behind this was a marked 17.3% year-on-year decline in household final consumption expenditure.  This drop in household final consumption expenditure was in stark  contrast with the decrease of 1.8% in the last quarter and recent  increases in excess of 2%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Compared with the second quarter of 2019, the household saving rate  increased in all but one of the Member States (for which data are  available) in the second quarter of 2020. Sweden was the only Member  State where there was a decline (-0.6pp), while the highest  year-over-year increase was observed for Ireland (+22.0 pp), followed by  Spain (+13.7 pp).  
&gt;  
&gt;The increase in the household saving rate in the majority of the  countries with available data is mainly explained by the large decrease  in household individual consumption expenditure. The largest decreases  in household expenditure were observed for Spain (-23.9%) and Ireland  (-22.8%), while the lowest decreases were noted in Czechia (-4.4%) and  Denmark (-7.7%).

Also if you know what the message is, then you also know the random padding length so that gives you 0 security there. It's better to add hashing of some sort.

Most security problems don't come from a problem in the randomness of a cipher, but from implementation. One time pads don't really help with that, I'd say they only make it worse.

Another thing multi device encryption is going to be a nightmare with this kind of setup, how do you know how much of the pad the other device used?

You being incapable of thinking understanding religion, or its impact in exploring the human spirit.. Doesn't make it not true. 

Religion is a descriptor of human emotion, understanding, reason and philosophy agreed upon and evolved over hundreds of years.

What makes an 'apple' true? Why is it called an apple? Why do we agree it looks a certain way.. Or that we can even eat it? What about from a molecular level... Is it still an apple?

Is Alexander the Great real? Why? Evidence we found him? Or rather his impact to society? His philosophy? His story? Or the story others told of him? How he changed the world?

Did God or the story of Jesus not change the world? More so than the great kings? Why do the 3 kings bring him gifts? Why did every medieval age king need approval under god? Why did they have to be answerable to god? What if they were not? Morality of a supremely powerful god king, changing every few years without any shared morality - would have been an even more dangerous world, even in a world of crazy religious kings... A crazy king who thinks he himself is a god, would undoubtedly be more dangerous.

Jung's case for god being real, is more compelling, and based on darwinian type reasoning in itself.

In the US, I'd guess that the federal bicameral legislature was partly inherited from the UK and partly because this new ""federal republic"" thing didn't need to represent nobles but *did* need to represent member states.

Russia is a federation, and similarly has a bicameral legislature.

Canada, also a federation, has a bicameral legislature that *seems* to be more powerful than but appears to, based on a skim of WP, by convention rarely use its powers, which seems curious:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada

&gt;Other than these two exceptions, the power of the two Houses of Parliament is theoretically equal; the approval of each is necessary for a bill's passage. In practice, however, the House of Commons is the dominant chamber of parliament, with the Senate very rarely exercising its powers in a manner that opposes the will of the democratically elected chamber. Although the Senate has not vetoed a bill from the House of Commons since 1939, minor changes proposed by the Senate to a bill are usually accepted by the House.

My impression is that Canadian government is somewhat less centralized than the American, so I'd have expected their Senate to be more active.

Almost all US states also have bicameral legislatures, though there are too many of them and my familiarity is too lacking to say much about their powers.

It makes Russia happy as they flex regional power, it makes Turkey and Azerbaijan happy with the direct link from Nahçivan to main Azerbaijan land and taking most of the territory back without fighting and still owning resources from Karabakh region which will still be under Azerbaijan control, just like before an autonomous region most probably. 

There is no reason to continue war and risk winter wars, foreign powers like USA getting involved etc when you won so much already.

Azerbaijan takes ALL of the Azeri-majority territory back.

Azerbaijan takes SOME of the Armenian-majority territory as well.

Rest of the territories go back to pre-abolishment with Russian and maybe Turkish forces for next 10 years in the area.

But for non German speakers like me who learned of this incident when young under the old name (and don’t speak a language that includes words like kristall or nacht, therefore have no other associations with them), “Kristallnacht” is a word that is suffused with violence and terror and triggers immediate revulsion and horror—the very opposite, presumably, of what the Nazi propaganda aimed for.

“Reichspogromnacht” conjures no emotional response, it’s just a word I don’t understand.

4230,"&gt; Dear compatriots, sisters and brothers. I have made a very, very difficult decision for myself and all of us.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have signed a statement with the Presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan on ending the Karabakh war at 01:00. The text of the statement that has already been published is unspeakably painful for me personally and for our people.  
&gt;  
&gt;I made that decision as a result of an in-depth analysis of the military situation and the assessment of the people who know the situation best. Also based on the belief that this is the best possible solution in the current situation. I will give a detailed message about all this in the coming days.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is not a victory, but there is no defeat until you recognize yourself as a loser. We will never recognize ourselves as losers and this should be the beginning of our era of national unification and rebirth.  
&gt;  
&gt;We need to analyze the years of our independence in order to plan our future and not repeat the mistakes of the past.  
&gt;

4267,"&gt;  nobody forces you into religion so why can’t people just respect catholics as they respect others?

the problem arises when they demand that their world views are turned into the law of the state like in some theocracies and when their views trump scientific facts. Take homosexuality, for example. The catholic church keeps saying that homosexuality is against nature, or a mental illness, in spite of the scientific consensus that it's neither and just a variant of the human sexual behaviour. A scientific consensus that exists pretty much in all the developed world. The American Psichiatric Association reached that conclusion in the 1970s.

And the Catholic church demands that its views on marriage apply to civil marriage as well as religious marriage, in spite of the fact that they are separate and legislators wouldn't force any religious confession to allow same sex marriage.","Ein Tirol ist nicht genug, dem Südtirol gebe Ich mein Vorzug",/r/europe/comments/jr1g0e/domestic_violence_is_not_a_tradition_one_of_the/gbrkfp4/,standy85,1604960947

1. Cease-fire applicable as of November 10th, noon (Moscow time). Both parties stop at their current position.
2. Agdam and Gazak regions to be given back to Azerbaijan forces by November 20th
3. Deployment of a ~2.000 Russian peacekeepers contingent along Artsakh and Lachin corridor's borders
4. The Russian contingent is here for 5 years, which would be automatically renewed every 5 years if none of the parties declares 6 months before the expiration of the period of intention to terminate the application of this provision
5. A peacekeeping center is being deployed to control the ceasefire
6. Armenia to return the Kelbajar region to Azerbaijan forces by November 15 and the Lachin region by December 1, 2020, leaving behind the Lachin corridor (5 km wide), which will ensure the connection of Artsakh with Armenia. In the next three years, a plan for the construction of a new traffic route along the Lachin corridor, providing communication between Stepanakert and Armenia, with the subsequent redeployment of the Russian peacekeeping contingent to protect this route will be determined. Azerbaijan guarantees the safety of traffic along the Lachin corridor of citizens, vehicles and goods in both directions.
7. Internally displaced persons and refugees are returning to the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent areas under the control of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
8. PoW, other prisoners, dead bodies exchange
9. Armenia to ensure transport links between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. Transport control is exercised by the bodies of the Border Service of the FSB of Russia.

Now, catholics might vote for rules that are not pro-abortion because that is wrong to us but we cannot condemn the Catholic Church or even Christianity as a whole because some priests who were not doing their job well told others to “hate those who don’t think like you”. A good  catholic priest might remind people that abortion is a sin to the eyes of God and therefor condemned by the church as well, but by no means catholic are allowed to force others into religion or impede others from their freedom. Catholics can try to change your mind from something we do not see as good but that’s it. Everything crossing that line goes against the freedom God gave each person and we are not to interfere with it. Now, saying that Catholics _pushed_ those hate laws can be considered 2 ways: something that is not contemplated in our religion or a grave accuse",,/r/europe/comments/jr1g0e/domestic_violence_is_not_a_tradition_one_of_the/gbr504x/,Fraltair_,1604953307

Why did neighbours grow while Poland was dropping this time?
Do these countries implement child benefit programs a longer time then Poland?
Are any of these neighbours birthrates increasing without childcare programs? 
What is the state doing to help with birthrates, any other programs?

The head of the European People's Party (EPP) faction in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, asked the Prime Ministers of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki and Hungary, Viktor Orban, to accept solutions on linking EU funds with the rule of law. ""Weber's appeal is frivolous"", PiS MEP Jadwiga Wiśniewska commented for PAP.  ""I appeal to Viktor Orban and Mateusz Morawiecki to notice that with such a mechanism we will depoliticize the entire process. **In the future, the assessment of the European Commission (regarding the rule of law - PAP) will be neutral. If a dispute arises, the Court of Justice will decide""** \- he told journalists in Brussels Weber.

&amp;#x200B;

""By using this mechanism you want to de facto introduce neocolonial exploitation of Central and Eastern European countries, you have historical experience in this,"" - Law and Justice MEP Jadwiga Wiśniewska replies to Weber's appeal in an interview with PAP - **""We are to pay a contribution to the EU budget, open our markets to your goods, pay new EU taxes, you eagerly take over our educated employees, and in return you want to block our access to the EU budget. We will not agree to this. We will not agree to discrimination ""**\- emphasizes Wiśniewska.  **""We can say that it is Prime Minister Morawiecki and Prime Minister Orban who can appeal to Mr. Weber: that he and others in the European Parliament do not delay the implementation of the results of the EU summit in July this year"" -** says Ryszard Czarnecki, PiS MEP.

&amp;#x200B;

It was then (in July) that the heads of state and government reached an agreement on the multiannual budget, the reconstruction fund and established the general framework for conditionality in access to EU funds.  A detailed agreement on the rule of law mechanism in the EU budget was reached by negotiators of the European Parliament and the German presidency last Thursday. It was criticized by the governments of Poland and Hungary. advertisement  **Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced last week that Poland will certainly exercise its right to object, if there is no agreement on linking the so-called rule of law with the EU budget.** In turn, Orban addressed a letter to the German presidency and heads of EU institutions, in which he threatened to veto the EU budget and the reconstruction fund if the disbursement of funds was related to the issue of the rule of law.  The majority in the European Parliament, which influenced the tightening of the regulations, however, hope that the regulation on the rule of law mechanism will eventually be adopted in the majority vote in the EU Council, and the rest will not be blocked

According to Weber, the entire long-term budget and reconstruction plan must not be allowed to be held hostage by Budapest. ""I want to make it clear. We should move forward. Viktor Orban will not change the result of last Thursday negotiations. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, decisions on this regulation are taken by the EU Council by qualified majority"" - emphasized the German politician.  **Law and Justice MEP Jadwiga Wiśniewska points out that her party supports solutions aimed at protecting the EU budget against fraud, and that was the direction in which the conclusions of the July EU summit were headed.** She also pointed out that EU regulations must comply with the law and cannot circumvent treaty mechanisms.  In her opinion, the conditionality solutions agreed last week mean circumventing Art. 7 of the EU treaty and the unanimity required under it as regards decisions on sanctions against any Member State.  **""We cannot agree to such solutions, because they are outside the Treaty. Weber's appeal is frivolous""** \- the MEP said in an interview with PAP.  Poland and Hungary have the option to block the decision to increase the EU's own resources, thanks to which it will be possible to raise funds from the financial markets for the reconstruction fund after the coronavirus.

The European Parliament has already issued its opinion on this matter, which allows for further steps to be taken by the EU Council and ratification of decisions by national parliaments, but for the time being there is no move on the part of the EU countries in this matter.",,/r/europe/comments/jr37m4/the_head_of_the_epp_group_calls_on_poland_and/gbqre7i/,TyrantfromPoland,1604946770

&gt; The chronicle of Aliyev's fiasco, on the eve of the national holiday of Azerbaijan. 

&gt; The Azeri forces fell into the trap set by the Armenians. Aliyev had promised his people and his Turkish bosses that his troops would parade on the day of their national holiday, November 9, in Shushi. 

&gt; The Armenians had a surprise in store for him. 

&gt; On the eve of November 9, they started evacuating Shushi in the morning. The civilians and 1,500 Armenian soldiers, mountain commandos, left the area, climbed into the surrounding mountains and set up a barracks, waiting for the Azeris to bite. 

&gt; The spy drones recorded the escape of the population and the soldiers. The fools believed that the Armenians had really left the area. The Azeris sent 30 scouts. They saw the area deserted. They notified the headquarters that Shushi had been abandoned. 

&gt; The 30 Azeris started celebrating and taking pictures in Shushi, until the rest of the aid arrived, consisting of 1,200 Turks and Azeris. 

&gt; They had fallen into the trap set by the Armenians! From the surrounding slopes of the mountains, the Armenian army began to descend with 1,500 men, all mountain commandos, and literally slaughtered them. 

&gt; 800 Turkish Azeris were killed. The others ran to escape. In their anguish to escape the massacre, they even threw their weapons into the street. 

&gt; This will be a day of shame for Aliyev and his army, where they were humiliated on the battlefield and even on the eve of their national holiday, where they will never forget it. 

&gt; After this fiasco, they wanted to entertain the impressions and started distributing to their friends in the media around the world, press releases about the alleged occupation of Shushi by the Azerbaijani army. The Azeri parrots got the news, without crossing it and played the game of propaganda and misinformation of Azerbaijan and Turkey. 

&gt; In Greece, the first and best the usual suspect, Nikos Evangelatos widely published the news, which he took from the Turkish media, as he states in his sources and from there began the Copy paste of the sites of the plate, which provide information only copy paste . 

&gt; Meanwhile, the Armenians in Shushi have set up a party and are celebrating for the great trick he achieved, as if they were getting married, as reported by Armenians who are in the area and describe the situation to us.

I guess you’re right, but I think there’s an exception for mass data collection by Google; they collect information you don’t actively “make”.

Say you visit a site via HTTPS, that, like pretty much every popular site, uses Google Analytics and Google Ad tools. When you load that site, the connection to both the site server and the Google servers are encrypted, in other words they are secure.

But you’re not browsing *privately*. Google uses the fact that they’re built into 85% of popular sites to build a profile on you and to serve you ads (and who knows what other stuff). Google’s servers are obviously highly secured. But Google doesn’t respect your privacy. Technically, only the intended people get to view your browsing history/preferences (i.e. you click that “agree” button), but probably didn’t want it to happen in the first place.

So in this case, everything is secure, but the setup doesn’t respect your privacy.

&gt; That is something I could get behind. But compromising all encryption for the sake of a few criminals? That sounds like a terrible idea.

I agree with that principle: any measures should only affect the subjects under investigation. A blanket open backdoor is just asking for problems.

4625,"from the article: 

&gt;Die Regierungen der EU-Mitgliedsstaaten haben sich darauf verständigt, sichere Verschlüsselung EU-weit zu verbieten. Das geht aus dem geheimen Entwurf einer geplanten Deklaration des EU-Ministerrats hervor, die der Österreichische Rundfunk (ORF) veröffentlicht hat. Zwar betont das Dokument zunächst die Bedeutung der Verschlüsselung und gelobt, sie zu fördern, doch dann wird nach ""innovativen Ansätzen"" und technischen Lösungen zur Brechung der Verschlüsselung verlangt.

&gt;In allgemeinverständliches Deutsch übersetzt bedeutet das Dokument, dass die Regierungen alle Dienstebetreiber dazu zwingen wollen, Hintertüren in ihre Verschlüsselung einzubauen. Darüber besteht offenbar bereits Einstimmigkeit im Rat der EU-Minister. Der Resolutionsentwurf heißt offiziell ""Sicherheit durch Verschlüsselung und Sicherheit trotz Verschlüsselung"".

&gt;Nach Einschätzung des ORF sollen Betreiber von Ende-zu-Ende-verschlüsselten Diensten wie WhatsApp und Signal dazu verpflichtet werden, für den Betrieb unnötig Generalschlüssel zu erzeugen und diese bei Behörden zu hinterlegen. Diese können sich dann jederzeit unerkannt in private Unterhaltungen und andere verschlüsselte Übertragungen einklinken. Die konkrete Methode stelle einen Man-in-the-Middle-Angriff dar und gehe auf einen Vorschlag britischer Spione zurück.

In English: 

&gt;The governments of the EU member states have agreed to prohibit secure encryption throughout the EU. This emerges from the secret draft of a planned declaration of the EU Council of Ministers, which the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) has published. Although the document initially emphasizes the importance of encryption and vows to promote it, it then calls for ""innovative approaches"" and technical solutions to break the encryption.

&gt; Translated into generally understandable German, the document means that governments want to force all service providers to build backdoors into their encryption. Apparently there is already unanimity on this in the Council of EU Ministers. The draft resolution is officially called ""Security through encryption and security despite encryption"".

&gt;In the opinion of ORF, operators of end-to-end encrypted services such as WhatsApp and Signal will be obliged to generate master keys unnecessary to normal business operations, and to deposit them with public authorities. These can then be used to examine private conversations and other encrypted transmissions undetected at any time. The concrete method represents a man-in-the-middle attack and is based on a proposal by British spies.",🇺🇸(NC) ->🇩🇪,/r/europe/comments/jqw8pn/eu_will_ban_endtoend_encryption_once_again_behind/gbpxy79/,Hoeppelepoeppel,1604931890

Ergo, for at least the first 2 years, Biden will not be able to do anything major on climate change. Rejoining the Paris Accord would be a good statement by the US but it would be just that, a statement.

The tithe (10% of your income, I'm pretty sure it doesn't need to go to your the Church either. Just to some form of charity) is not and has never been necessary for salvation.


If the priests are actually teaching that then they are literal heretics. Salvation in the Orthodox Church is and has always been a process that is happening through working together with God to allow him to make you more and more like him.

&gt; the data also indicates that obama lowered deportation and trump increased it.

Lol, that is what you cling onto just because you don't want to admit Obama did more deportations than Trump? Go on, pick any three years of the Obama's presidency of your choice from my comment up above and add the numbers of those three years up. And even then, that number is more than the number of illegal immigrants deported by Trump in the three years of his presidency. 

Also, the reason why you have no clue from where I got my claims of total separation from, is because I never even mentioned total separation in any form whatsoever on this thread lol. Where did you even get that from?

So your only defense to Obama building up cages and putting kids in them is that ""there was a crisis."" Would you still have that same defense if it were Trump in place of Obama under same circumstances? I guess not.

My area can get really bad hail storms. To prevent the worst of it we 'seed' the storm clouds.

I might be wrong on the specifics, but the general point is that we get less hail and more intense rain.

We started doing that 20-30 years ago, and it looks like Romania started around the same time. My city's drainage was built to handle the hail and small amounts of rain, not large flash-flood events, so we often end up with streets that are flooded for an hour or two after a big storm.",,/r/europe/comments/jqrrad/i_present_to_you_the_far_superior_romanian/gbparcv/,redopz,1604910831

5096,"No problem.

I can’t speak to pardons in other countries, but I think the men who wrote the U.S. constitution realized that sometimes an injustice can be done and they wanted a backstop. Also, the Christian concept of forgiveness may have informed their thinking. I also think they believed that, in general, elected leaders would be men of honor because they would get their positions based on merit rather than inheritance. In retrospect, they were probably a bit naive on that point.

Now this is going to blow your mind - the president may be able to pardon himself because the constitution doesn’t specify that he can’t pardon himself and the more I think about it, the more I think he is going to take this path. Because norms and history mean exactly zero to soon-to-be-ex president Trump. 

The preemptive Ford pardon on Nixon was constitutionally suspect, but it was never challenged by which I mean it was never brought to the Supreme Court. However, it was a very unpopular move and probably at least part of the reason why Ford was not re-elected. I strongly suspect that the Democrats will not want to spend the political capital to argue against any federal pardon of Trump before the Supreme Court, so he will get away with abusing this rule too. But everyone knows that the state of New York has been building a case against soon-to-be-ex president Trump and they could be ready to go with an indictment the minute he leaves office. So that will probably have to be enough.

ISTANBUL, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Turkey's lira surged 2% against the U.S. dollar on Monday, after Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said he was resigning for health reasons, the second surprise departure of a top economic policymaker in two days after the central bank chief was ousted.

The lira TRYTOM=D3 stood at 8.3650 against the dollar at 0325 GMT, strengthening from a close of 8.5445 on Friday, with analysts saying that the departure of the two top policymakers had set the stage for a sharp interest rate rise.

The upheaval follows a 30% slide in the lira to record lows this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as investors worried about falling forex reserves and the central bank's ability to tackle double-digit inflation.

Albayrak's resignation, announced in an Instagram statement confirmed by an official, came a day after his father-in-law President Tayyip Erdogan replaced the central bank governor with a former minister whose policies are seen to be at odds with Albayrak.

""I have decided that I cannot continue as a minister, which I have been carrying out for nearly five years, due to health problems,"" the statement said. Albayrak became finance minister two years ago after serving as energy minister.

Two sources at the presidency could neither confirm nor deny the statement when reached by Reuters, but a Finance Ministry official confirmed its authenticity.

Erdogan, who appointed former finance minister Naci Agbal as the new central bank governor on Saturday, would need to approve the resignation.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/jqqu9d/turkish_lira_gains_value_after_finances_minister/gbotdfx/,-Equestris-,1604895848

5137,"It's a bit more complicated than what you're saying.

Firstly, the only way that state legislatures can ""direct"" the appointment of electors is also the only way that they can ever act - via legislation. The current legislation is clear, and I have described its function. The state legislatures have pre-approved the process - there is no formality in the present legal process that involves the state legislatures ""signing off"" on electors. You quoted Article II Section 1 Clause 2, but Article II Section 1 Clause 4 states the following:

&gt;The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.

The time which Congress determined was November 3rd - the state legislatures can't pass legislation to change their method of appointing electors after that date (they can, but it would apply to the next presidential election and elections following).

Not to mention, an abundance of legal precedent in the past century has established that by the 14th Amendment, the removal of the right to vote and to have a vote counted without due process is not constitutional - and invalidating the popular vote in an election is likely to be seen as equivalent to nullifying those votes. So I doubt the Supreme Court would allow the states to pass a law of that nature (appointing one party's slate of electors without regard to the popular vote) even if there were time left to do it.

In short - it may have been possible prior to the election, but the 14th Amendment means still probably not.",,/r/europe/comments/jpvdv0/joe_biden_is_elected_president_of_the_united/gbovfxo/,jmc1996,1604897259

There’s some of Jesus, Obama, Trump, Trudeu, Macron, AMLO, Tom cruise, etc. The only double standard here is that we are ok drawing all of them, but not Muhammad. 

Lastly. I agree. We need to be kind to other people. But freedom of and freedom from religion cannot be compromised. Not now. Not ever. 

Drawing Muhammad is forbidden in Islam. Which is great. But they can’t tell us not to do it because we aren’t Muslims. 

Eating pork is forbidden in Judaism. But they can’t tell us not to do it because we aren’t jews. 

Freedom of religion allows people to say “I can’t do X, because it’s against my religion.” It doesn’t say “You can’t do X because that’s against my religion.” That is religious oppression and when they threaten violence upon you then it becomes religious intimidation.

I have a question about a Polish poem and I’ve been seeking the answer for years now—mainly with Google and, of course, international imageboards. I can’t find the answer for this one. 

I took a class at my uni in Chicago called “The Polish Masters” or something like this—it was basically an intro to Polish literature and we read everything from the earliest recorded instances of Polish literature (they were church songs and homilies) up to stuff written in the 1960s. This was all in translation (English).

Anyway—there is a poem I’ll never forget because I loved it so much and I keep trying to find it based on the name or the author. We studied it in the class.

The poem was about a pianist who played Polish national music in a building which was being attacked during either WWI or WWII. Like the band on the “Titanic” who played music until the ship completely sank, he played the piano until the building was completely burned down or bombed out.

It was a beautiful poem.

More like publics being twitchy about it.  It's an interesting question, and it's not a new issue.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_FXt0eM

Here's Milton Friedman on it, starting at 03:42, talking about free trade in steel (at the time, the US steel industry was calling for protection against Japanese steel producers):

&gt; Now why, is the steel industry and similar industries, why are they so effective in their campaigns for protection?  Because of a very common problem that affects not only this but lots...lots else, and that is the difference between the visible and the invisible.  The people who are going to lose their jobs in steel are very visible.  They're a collective group.  You can name their names.  Suppose we restrict imports from Japan.  Then people are going to lose their jobs in these export industries.  They will be widely spread over the country.  You and I couldn't name one person...but that doesn't mean they're any less real.  But the greater propaganda effect of the steel industry is because you can set...the visible is a more potent political force than the invisible people who will lose their jobs.

I'd suggest the concept of *concentration of benefit, diffusion of cost* is a factor.  There is a certain fixed cost to engaging in political advocacy.  An company that is going to go out of business due to trade barriers being lowered is an organization that already exists, is organized, has a significant benefit per person -- enough that it's worth actually aiming to do something about it for the people involved.  The benefits of advocating for protectionism are concentrated in this company or industry.  They can arrange for marketing campaigns and the like opposing free trade that will put them out of business.

The benefits that will be derived from barriers being lowered are diffused across many people, a small amount.  Many of the people probably do not know that they will be potentially employed by a company that would benefit.   Few people are willing to individually take action over a small benefit to them.

https://fee.org/articles/concentrated-benefits-and-diffused-costs-explain-the-persistence-of-tariffs/

(FEE's a right-libertarian organization, for those not familiar with it.)

&gt;Tariffs hurt more people than they help. So why do those outnumbered few keep winning so many political victories at the majority’s expense?
&gt;
&gt;The answer can be found in the concept of concentrated benefits and diffused costs. Gordon Tullock gives an example of this with his Tullock Economic Development Plan, which “involves placing a dollar of additional tax on each income tax form in the United States and paying the resulting funds to Tullock, whose economy would develop rapidly” (see more on this plan on p.13 of “Virtuous Capitalism,” Fred Smith’s and my 2015 paper on rent-seeking).
&gt;
&gt;For the losing majority, a dollar per year is not worth the trouble of going all the way to Washington and trying to get Congress to change policy. But Tullock has hundreds of millions of reasons to fight as hard as he can to keep that unfair policy in place. That is why concentrated beneficiaries usually win out over indifferent majorities.
&gt;
&gt;The late economist Mancur Olson develops the idea more fully in his classic book *The Logic of Collective Action*. Olson points out that it is far easier to organize a small group than a large one. Not only that, but people in a smaller group are also more likely to know each other and police each other than in a larger group. That social dynamic means smaller groups are less likely to have shirkers, slackers, and deserters than a larger group. And because fewer people are sharing the spoils, smaller groups pursue their missions more intensely than larger, diffused groups where each individual member has less at stake.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/jqcyhv/exclusive_joe_biden_will_not_prioritise_ukus/gbomcor/,duisThias,1604891495

5290,"He wasn't a pedo.

First, Hadhrat Ayesha was the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr. Tabari reports, “All four of \[Abu Bakr’s\] children were born of his two wives…during the pre-Islamic period \[i.e., pre-610 AD\].” \[11\] Hadhrat Ayesha’s marriage to Prophet Muhammad took place one year after Hijra (emigration to Medina), or around 624 AD. Therefore, even if Hadhrat Ayesha had been born as late as 609 AD, only a year before Prophet Muhammad claimed prophethood, she would have been roughly fourteen at the time of emigration to Medina in 623 and therefore no less than fifteen at the time of her marriage to Prophet Muhammad. This is a far cry from the age of six that critics assert.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise, most historians report that Hadhrat Asma, Hadhrat Ayesha’s elder sister, was ten years her senior. \[12\] The books Tahzibut Tahzib and Al-Bidaayah wa an-Nihayah both report that Hadhrat Asma died at the age of one hundred, in 73 AH (695 AD). \[13\] This means that Hadhrat Asma must have been no younger than twenty-seven at the time of emigration. Hadhrat Ayesha’s marriage to Prophet Muhammad was in 1 AH or by some sources 2 AH, when Asma was twenty-eight. This means that at a minimum, Hadhrat Ayesha was eighteen or nineteen upon her consenting marriage to Prophet Muhammad.

&amp;#x200B;

research showed that she was actually 15 at the time of her betrothal and 19 at the time of her marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

Research subsequent to the time of Maulana Muhammad Ali has shown that she was older than this. An excellent short work presenting such evidence is the Urdu pamphlet Rukhsati kai Waqt Sayyida Aisha Siddiqa ki Umar (‘The age of Lady Aisha at the time of the start of her married life’) by Abu Tahir Irfani. Points 1 to 3 below has been brought to light in this pamphlet.

&amp;#x200B;

The famous classical historian of Islam, Ibn Jarir Tabari, wrote in his ‘History’:

&amp;#x200B;

“In the time before Islam, Abu Bakr married two women. The first was Fatila daughter of Abdul Uzza, from whom Abdullah and Asma were born. Then he married Umm Ruman, from whom Abdur Rahman and Aisha were born. These four were born before Islam.”

&amp;#x200B;

Being born before Islam means being born before the Call.

&amp;#x200B;

The compiler of the famous Hadith collection Mishkat al-Masabih, Imam Wali-ud-Din Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Khatib, who died 700 years ago, has also written brief biographical notes on the narrators of Hadith reports. He writes under Asma, the older daughter of Abu Bakr:

&amp;#x200B;

“She was the sister of Aisha Siddiqa, wife of the Holy Prophet, and was ten years older than her. … In 73 A.H. … Asma died at the age of one hundred years""

&amp;#x200B;

This would make Asma 28 years of age in 1 A.H., the year of the Hijra, thus making Aisha 18 years old in 1 A.H. So Aisha would be 19 years old at the time of the consummation of her marriage, and 14 or 15 years old at the time of her nikah. It would place her year of birth at four or five years before the Call.

&amp;#x200B;

The same statement is made by the famous classical commentator of the Holy Quran, Ibn Kathir, in his book Al-bidayya wal-nihaya:

&amp;#x200B;

“Asma died in 73 A.H. at the age of one hundred years. She was ten years older than her sister Aisha.""",God Bless the United States,/r/europe/comments/jqfmd4/pakistan_thousands_urge_cutting_ties_with_france/gbonnge/,BewareTheKing,1604892278

I speak English decently and can do decently at other European languages. I've lived in Vienna for a while, so I don't have any integration issues, I'd prosper just fine in the West.

I've had dozens if not more of opportunities to go work for private hospitals and even teach there.

I've said no and will continue to say no. My country lacks people, especially educated people. The desperate, low level materialism must stop, and people need to contribute to their native land.

Should I mention that my medical education was paid by taxes and was mostly free (had to buy manuals etc)? How could I leave? I have a duty to serve my people for sure, they paid up so I can learn and become a medic.

On the other hand interestingly whilst there is certainly right wing or white supremacist terrorism , I can’t say I have the impression there is much ‘Christian’ terrorism as such in Europe in which people have been indoctrinated by extremist sermons in churches and scream Jesus is great while blowing themselves up or beheading someone for drawing a cartoon.

5398,"I mean, you're just scraping the barrel at the moment now. So you're telling me that just because you think Trump caged kids out of ""inhumane racism"" that is somehow worse than what Obama did in the first place?

Also, where was the criticism during Obama's presidency for kids being caged? Right, the liberal news media never reported it and you never knew because that is all you refer to.

Dude, Obama not only built the cages but also put kids in them. There are photos dating to 2014 of kids locked up in cages in detention centres. So he is to blame as much as Trump is. Those policies continued into Trump's presidency until the liberal news picked up on it.  

It's fact that kids were locked up in cages during Obama's presidency first. You can offer whatever reason for such a policy that ""obama had to do it."" to put your point across. But saying that somehow the same thing that Trump later did is worse because of his so-called ""racist sentiments"" pushed by the media would be full of bias.

5489,"I'm gonna be completely honest and say the people in this post and sub saying shit like ""We can finally breathe again"" are really funny.

As Europeans, the main way that the US election impacts us is how the future president will view and change US-Europe relations. Trump, for all the rhetoric around leaving NATO, did not do so and in fact, in certain Eastern European countries, expanded US NATO operations. Some of the Eastern European countries most at risk from Russia, like Poland, achieved great relations with the US during the Trump administration. 
His rhetoric about NATO and such did end up pressuring European countries like Germany, Poland, France and Italy amongst many, to finally increase their defence spending and commit to eventually reaching the 2% of GDP defence spending (Poland has already reached it) as required by the NATO treaties themselves.
This can only be good for Europeans, as the US declines on the world stage, eventually Europe will have to take its fate in its hands and not rely and freeload on the US' military.

Would Europe-US relations be better under Biden? Probably. Yet, as France's foreign minister Le Drian said, EU-US relations have already shifted permanently, the EU has finally started to grasp the need for common military action outside of NATO, a concept impossible to conceive just a decade ago. It is unlikely that a Biden administration would change that, as European leaders understand that US priorities have shifted towards the Asian-Pacific theater since even before the Trump administration. The US no longer really cares about Europe beyond stopping it from falling under Chinese influence. China has become to both Democrats and Republicans the main issue in US foreign policy.

Overall, nothing much, expect US pressure for more European defence spending, will change for and in Europe as a result of Biden being the next president just as it did not under Trump.

TLDR: Trump didn't change much of NATO. In fact, Europeans got so shit scared of him screaming about NATO, that the only thing that changed in NATO during his term was increased European defence spending. Biden, just like Trump and Obama, doesn't really care about Europe and is focused on China. It's time for Europe to understand that and start taking independent action outside of NATO.



Personal note: In terms of US foreign policy, which is almost the only way US policy affects Europeans' lives, Trump and Biden are extremely similar. They are both inside the norm of US military doctrine. 

Trump didn't stop the drone strikes of Yemeni children that Obama had ramped up and in fact, increased them on occasions, resulting in hundreds of deaths of Yemeni civilians. He sold tons of arms to the Saudis so they could keep killing Yemeni children but on the ground instead. Trump increased tension in the Middle East through provocation of Iran, which needless to say does not benefit Europe in the least.

Biden voted in favour of the Iraq War as a US Senator in 2002 in clear violation of international law and the US charter. The Iraqi war resulted in the deaths of hundred of thousands of Iraqis, some estimates say more than a million. Thus, everyone who voted for the resolution in Congress is at least partially responsible for those deaths. That, in my opinion, makes them murderers and war criminals considering the atrocities committed during that war. On top of that, even after warnings from some European countries (i.e. France and Germany) about the consequences to the region, the US Congress did not care for it and still voted for the resolution. The rise of ISIS, which has been responsible for hundreds of deaths of European citizens, has been often attributed to the regional and Iraqi instability following the US attempts at nation building in Iraq after the invasion.
Additionally, Biden never condemned Obama for authorising and ramping up US drone strikes on Yemeni civilian targets, including hospitals, resulting in hundreds of deaths of Yemeni civilians during the Obama administration.

In my opinion, both Trump and Biden are war criminals who deserved if not the death penalty, at least a lifetime in prison for their crimes against humanity. But hey the US is good and great so they will never get charged and/or convicted for those crimes. 

TLDR: Trump and Biden are disgusting war criminals so who really cares which one of the two is elected to keep bombing Yemeni children in hospitals.",,/r/europe/comments/jpvdv0/joe_biden_is_elected_president_of_the_united/gbns43u/,notincognit,1604874825

There was no Macedono-Bulgarian, there has been only Bulgarian.

Now people from North Macedonia refuse to admit that they even speak Bulgarian at all, they claim that their language developed by itself in Macedonia. If they say they speak Macedono-Bulgarian - nobody will have a problem, but they do not say this. They claim their language is independent of Bulgarian all together and is Macedonian. (because Bulgaria is a dirty word)

This is like Austria claiming that their (German) language is just Austrian and refusing to admit it is actually German, therefore claiming the entire German language for themselves and invalidating any other country which speaks it.

The president is the commander in chief. The amount of power one holds in that position is hard to comprehend. They fully control the most powerful weapons ever known to man, which have the potential to eradicate our species wholesale if used.

Presidents appoint federal judges for lifetime appointments.

They have a huge responsibility in moments of national crisis like a pandemic.

They appoint people to incredibly powerful positions all over the federal government.

The legislative function of the diets of both Bohemia and Moravia was revoked; all subsequent legislation was to be by royal decree, receiving only formal approval from the diets.  

Catholicism was declared as an official religion and everybody was forced to convert. Most educated people often chose exile - around 80% of Czech nobility emigrated. Their properties were often given to foreign nobles.

The German language was declared an official language of Czechia. 

Thus, the Czech language ceased to be used as a language of the upper classes and educated people. Czech lands lost their independence and become just a province in the Habsburg realm.

5819,"I have watched a few of those documentaries, one thing to remember is how much the farmed salmon industry improves all the time, and many of the documentaries are old, and earns money on being ""shocking"". I believe all salmon is now fed with organic food which isn't as bad (if i remember correctly salmon farms release less than 2% of Norways ocean waste). 

&gt;Not only is it made out of fish oil

Not any more

Farmed salmon actually contains less toxins than wild salmon now. The only negative health consequence is that it contains some degree less of omega-3

I can't find any info on ""dangerous Monsanto chemicals"" but they do use flubenzurons to kill lice, which can have a negative impact on crusteaceans, in worst cases up to 1000m in the vecinity of the farms. Lots of fish are also sold to China, where they are pumped with chemicals, if thats what you mean? 

There are many horrorpictures of farmed salmon, most of these cases has been reported to the police, the CEO can go to jail if its bad enough. One thing to remember is, what happens at the pig farms, with farmed chicken, veal, ect? One bad deed doesn't excuse another, but we have to realize farming meat for 7bn humans has some horrific consequences.",,/r/europe/comments/jprial/norway_to_send_17_million_kroner_in_humanitarian/gbm4c77/,almightyleader,1604845441

We shouldn't have quota, but those numbers are still a good indicator for how equal a society is.

Btw, I don't think that this map is enough, because there are also:

\- disparities depending on the field (many more men in engineering sciences, many more women in literature).

\- disparities depending on the level (men usually get higher positions).

5843,"My personal experience is based in Germany, but France is somewhat similar. Here are a few reasons:

1. Germany and France are very conservative when it comes to gender roles, raising kids and expectations for the upbringing of said kids. It is still quite common for the woman to be raised for and expected to care for the family while the father is expected to provide for it.
2. A lot of women, especially in more rural parts don't see a necessity to study and are searching for a job with 2 workdays. They prefer work in administration, basic medical staff, etc.
3. Classical research disciplines like chemistry, physics, mathematics and computer science are viewed as more of a mens world and you have a high percentage of male students, laking almost any female students. I studied CS in Munich, we were something like 80 men and 3 women. 2 of them changed major in the first year. Our graduation was something like 1 woman and 40 men. (And yes, the culling in CS is around 50-70%).
4. It is very hard to become a researcher. It takes years of studying, working in a laboratory both with a low payment (something like 2000\~2500 Euros) and with long working hours, in some places inkl. weekends. This is the experience based on my wife's work as a cancer researcher, where she needed to work with highly dangerous substances, and was expected to be at least 6 days a week, 10 hours per day. Furthermore, her continuation was based on constantly delivering results. If you don't - you are out. Not worth it, that is why she switched. You get the same money for making some basic tests, have your 40 hours work week and 0 health risk.
5. The long working hours do effectively put your personal life on hold. And even if you are in a relationship and you want to build a family... men can't get pregnant.",,/r/europe/comments/jqbgot/percentage_of_female_researchers_in_europe_by_map/gbm4kbz/,MagesticPlight1,1604845589

5909,"&gt; Its electoral system, in which the candidate who loses the popular vote can easily win the White House, probably makes a lot of sense to Americans but not to anyone else. 

It's designed to make sure that only certain states with bigger populated cities don't decide who the president will be but the presidential vote should represent all the states or majority of states.  
  
If this was to apply to European Union, electoral vote would mean the European presidency wouldn't be decided by 2-3 most populated states (Germany and France and crowded big cities there) but would require representative votes (electors) from all states; Poland, Spain, Portugal, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Greece etc.   
   
Highly populated States like California (with big cities like Los Angeles approaching 15-20 million population), New York (with 10-15 million populated NYC) and TX have a lot of electoral seats due to big populations, but states like Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, Nevada, Colorado, Michigan etc. all have their own representation, hence the ""United States"".",Earth,/r/europe/comments/jq76hm/europe_the_pretrump_world_wont_come_back/gblroac/,angelheart_,1604838248

5943,"They were supported by USA during the cold war era to counter the rising popularity of communism among young Turkish people. The grey wolves and the leftist groups were killing each other in the streets in the 70s all across the country, which led to the 1980 Turkish military coup to establish order again. 

The military executed many people. Although they claimed they did not take sides, the executed and imprisoned ones were almost all leftists. So the grey wolves were pretty much given a pass. They have been politically represented in the Turkish parliament with the name MHP (Nationalist Movement Party).

Up until a few years ago, MHP was a staunch opposer of Erdogan, but for reasons unknown to the Turkish public, they had a sudden change in stance and are now in alliance with Erdogan, supporting him in every policy no matter how un-nationalist it may be. 

This also forced Erdogan to change the undertone of his speeches from strictly bashing Turkish nationalism in favor of political Islam, to a more nationalist one. Because political Islam does not have a very strong voter base in Turkey, Erdogan currently has to appear nationalistic (although everyone knows that he wants to base his concept of unity on Islamic principles).

Before its change of heart, MHP had a voter popularity of ~12%. After it allied itself with Erdogan, the more secular ones in the ranks of MHP left and founded the iYiP. This caused both parties to be unable to pass the 10% vote limit required to obtain seats in the parliament. So Erdogan changed the rules and created the alliance system and made it possible for MHP to have seats in alliance with his AKP. Therefore MHP (thus, the Grey Wolves) are now in a symbiotic relationship. Each dependent on the other.",,/r/europe/comments/jp4voo/germany_seeks_to_ban_grey_wolves/gblsfbs/,simpleton_v,1604838569

You may not change gear, but a couple of seventy year olds cycling for fun may find it a bit more difficult (although most use electric bikes nowadays). There's a lot of recreational cycling in this part of the country, so facilitating cyclists was probably an argument.

The trend simply continued during Trump, if he didn't do a thing the whole time, it would probably have led to the same or better result (and he did add to the debt significantly). Also Biden did stutter much worse as a kid, so most of his speech issues are just remains of that.
