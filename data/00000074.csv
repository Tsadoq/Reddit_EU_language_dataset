29,"I agree that nobody should be called a bigot only because of their geographical classification of countries. At the same time, I think once you get more familiar with why certain Central Europeans are irritated by the term 'Eastern Europe', it's not so hard to stop applying it to them.

It is a purely political classification from the Cold War (not geographic, as Finland or Greece are never called Eastern despite being located way east from Germany - as per your definition- and instead are called Northern/Southern Europe). This irritates some people as they, indeed, don't want to be associated with the former Soviet Union. The saying goes something like 'nothing good ever came from the East'.

Central Europe is simply a better political and cultural classification. I see in your flair that you are half German, so maybe you will be familiar with the term Mittleuropa that roughly describes the area of former German and Austrian empires. This classification is much closer to the everyday realities of the region as you cannot erase hundreds of years of cohabitation and common traditions by 45 years of communism. Central Europe is Catholic (and partially Protestant) as opposed to Eastern Orthodoxy, it shares many customs with the German-speaking regions but much fewer with the Ukrainian and Russian regions in the East. History, traditions, and religion have a large impact on a nation's culture and totalitarian ideology is unable to erase this.

Therefore, when somebody doesn't like to be associated with Eastern Europe, it doesn't have to mean they hate it. They might not feel the connection of their country with the East.

TLDR: Central Europe is a better classification for the countries in the region.",,/r/europe/comments/icoa1g/a_slovak_man_jozef_chovanec_has_died_while_in_the/g278b7p/,DiplomaticButter,1597920397

53,"Social distancing and washing hands is of course important for controlling the spread, but it's not *why* nursing homes in Stockholm were hit hard. Of course Swedes washed their hands and stopped seeing each other just like the rest of Europe did. Nursing homes stopped taking visitors, and still enforce this policy.

The reason why the virus could get in to nursing homes, in particular in Stockholm, is as I mentioned earlier, the working conditions. They have a high number of people who work short shifts, meaning that the effect of ""social distancing"" was nullified. This was a problem before covid19, but with covid19 it meant the death of hundreds of people.

There was essentially no difference between Finland's and Sweden's early response.

73,"I think this is an interesting discussion but I'm not too well versed in all of these persons and their stances. The list seems a bit random too me because you will find just as many people who spoke out and warned of fascist movements in their initial stages. While early fascism and Nazism definitely had a different popular appeal in the beginning because they looked shiny and grandiose, opinions quickly went sour with every step they took towards totalitarianism. 

On Churchill and Ghandi I can make two small comments though as they were definitely not progressives in my opinion:

Churchill was a war romanticizing warrior type of the Navy and one can definitely see why a man like him would sympathize with strong man politics. But I'm also pretty sure he was anti-totalitarian. I admit that I don't know much more about him, so I'm happy to learn.

Ghandi on the other hand had some nutty suggestions for the British like rolling over and let the Nazis rape their island, so I don't know I we should even care what he has to say in those matters. 
Or in any others. He also mused that non-violence by the Jewish community might melt Hitler's heart. 
He preferred an preindustrial and deurbanized Indian nation and wanted the country to unlearn the last 50 years of technological progress. 

&gt;You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions. Let them take possession of your beautiful island, with your many beautiful buildings. You will give all these but neither your souls, nor your minds. If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourself man, woman and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them.

210,"It has to do with the checks and balances in place.

Basically it works like this:

The parliament wants to introce a new law? If it changes the constitution, a mandatory referendum must be held, and the populace decides.

If the new law does not alter the constitution, a referendum can be held, as soon as enough signatures have been collected.

Now put yourself in the shoes of a member of parliament: a referendum lurks around everything you might propose. Do you want to have worked for nothing? If it's too unreasonable or too drastic, it is almost guaranteed that it will fail. So you go for very moderate changes only, after discussing all implications with all imaginable minorities.

Then there's the popular initiatives. If it's a sensible or urgent topic indeed, the parliament would have taken care of it already. Hence the popular initiatives almost always are in reality quite unpopular. Oftentimes, the parliament presents a more measured compromise along with the popular initiative. You end up voting for both (and for the case that both are accepted, you answer a third question, which one you prefer in such a case).

There's your reasons, why most new proposals get rejected.

246,"I would argue that Lenin changed Marxism quite fundamentally. Revolution ""Marx style"" requires popular support - majority of the society has to be communists in order for it to work. On the other hand, when Lenin started setting up shop in Russia, there were still people there who lived during serfdom. It was a country barely past feudalism and nowhere near ready for a communist revolution. Lenin's big change was creating the idea of a vanguard party, that was supposed to lead the people towards communism inspite of the lack of popular support. He basically concluded that, if at the time it wasn't possible to achieve his goal through democratic means ( by which I mean ""the people leading themselves"", rather than the usual ""through the mechanisms of a liberal democracy"", as obviously Tzarist Russia wasn't a democracy), he would just turn to authoritarianism instead. Of course the problem here is that this way of doing things comes with an inherent risk of the vanguard party abandoning their original ideals and becoming unwilling to cede power - which is exactly what happened in the USSR and it's satellite states.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/icqmlw/spanish_communist_party_shows_its_support_of/g26uw1t/,HadACookie,1597906662

392,"I understand turkey's point and if it was any other country that acted more reasonably and we could trust, I think we wouldn't have a problem to reach a settlement. 

However I think that you also agree that if the roles were reversed and Turkey had UNCLOS on its side, it wouldn't be bargaining a single centimeter of its EEZ just because Greece thinks it's ""not fair"". If turkey had Salamina and it got a lot of EEZ next to Greece because of this, it would absolutely be doing the same.

I also know about the cases with the other countries and the court and the results they achieved, that's why I said Turkey has a chance to get a good ruling, however this requires Turkey to go to international Court and it avoids to do that. I think Turkey doesn't want to risk going to a trial cause it can't bully the ICJ and there are cases where the court has also taken in consideration other facts that Turkey wants to avoid like the 12 miles of territorial waters. If the court ruled in favor to Turkey regarding Kastellorizo but also justified Greece in extending it's waters to 12 miles, that could be troublesome for Turkey.  On the other hand using its fleet to try to pressure Greece into make an agreement is more convenient for Turkey so it chooses that.

Also I think that this particular case with Greece is a bit more special that the other cases cause we're not talking about a single rogue island. Kastellorizo is part of the Dodecanese complex and Greece has over 3000 islands which are an important part of its territory so even though a favorable ruling toward Turkey is possible, It could be different from the solutions you see in those other cases.

Idk like I said, Turkey deciding to follow UNCLOS would be a good thing for it at least diplomatically, but Turkey feels like it has better chances by ignoring it and claiming a lot more so I hope the two counties can at least settle this in court in the future and accept any ruling.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/icn33d/after_turkish_and_greek_warships_collided_the/g26pfze/,Divide-By-Zero88,1597901865

431,"I think that it's not as easy as that. For them standards of living were exponentially getting better. It's really difficult to wrap your heads around this so let me explain.

1940s Croatia was incredibly uneducated, poor, 95% farming, only 10% of people even went to universities and most people had only 4 years of elementary school education.

I'll take my grandparents as an example, no electricity, no running water, no television, kerosene lights, no fridge, no washing machines, nothing. Every single appliance you can buy today they did not have. They stored ice in a hole in the ground and most of it melted by summer. They made their own clothes, own food, own everything. 

From 1950~1990 my grandfather worked in agriculture as a farmer. He was basically in a generational house living with 3 other generations. The grandfather that owned the house had the final word on everything. 

By 1965 he had earned enough to buy a house in a nearby village, this instantly gave him electricity, running water, plumbing. 

Then from the yearly profits of the land they bought a Bicycle, A Television, A Fridge, Electric Mixer, Motorcycle, New Tractor, New Tractor Attachments, Car, Another Television, Another Bicycle, Radios, Washing Machine, Freezer, Smoke Chamber, and so on and on... 

He literally went from 0 to having a fully equipped house. In the span of about 15~20 years. 

Meanwhile I'm alive 3x years. I live in the same house I grew up in, I didn't buy a new car, I didn't buy a new house, I bought ton of appliances but they cost next to nothing compared to one of the TV back in the day that would translate about 3000$ in todays money. 

I have objectively achieved a lot less then he has.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/icjgvh/how_croatia_has_developed_from_1990_to_2020/g26feho/,SvijetOkoNas,1597894881

483,"That just isn’t how Germany works. Germany has a mixed parliamentary system which essentially (and very simply put) allows people to vote for parties in parliament and those representatives in turn elect the chancellor (equivalent to prime minister in Canada and elsewhere). It is similar to how the speaker of the house is chosen except just with many parties instead of two. So they vote for their chancellor in the same way that you vote for the speaker of the house, any legislation in congress, and even president: via representatives/electors. So voting for a member of Merkel’s party *is* voting for her as chancellor. It is simply a different system entirely to yours and whether you like it or not, that’s just how it is. There seems to be no opposition to it (that I have seen) within Germany. It is just a different type of democracy. 

As for referendums, I am not 100% familiar with that aspect of the German constitution, but as far as I know Germany’s constitution simply does not have a provision allowing for nation-wide referendums.

Doesn’t sound like he had that much support even in 2014.

In 2018 regarding the presidential election, a speech was leaked in which Erdogan ordered seizing of ballot boxes to ensuring that “work there would be finished before it even started.”

Just last year, Istanbul had to do the election again because the opposition won the first time by 14,000 votes despite all the corruption. Thankfully people didn’t give up this time and he won by a bigger margin (800,000) the second time.

I don’t think someone who has 42% of the population would have to corrupt elections in such ways. Not to mention them bribing poor citizens with pasta and coal to increase their popularity. All of this stuff is common knowledge in Turkey. At best he has about 35% of the population. 42% from the last election is solely coming from corruption, if he truly had 42% the corruption could easily have brought that percentage over 50%.

For reference [here](https://twitter.com/metropoll/status/1295249870832508928?s=21) is the most recent poll, but take it with a grain of salt as polls can be biased.

551,"&gt; it wasn't about ideology

Ideology was definitely a huge factor.

A large part of Hitler policy was built around anti-communism. He believed “Jewish Marxism” was a threat, and regularly references communism in Mein Kampf as one the greatest enemies of Germany. He believed that Marxism was a Jewish plot to destroy Germany, and he advocated for “the destruction of Marxism in all its shapes and forms” When he was tried for his involvement in the Munich Beer Hall Pusch, he claimed that his singular goal was to assist the German government in “fighting Marxism”.

In 1939, Hitler told the Swiss Commissioner to the League of Nations Carl Burckhardt that everything he was undertaking was ""directed against Russia"" and that ""if those in the West are too stupid or too blind to understand this, then I shall be forced to come to an understanding with the Russians to beat the West, and then, after its defeat, turn with all my concerted force against the Soviet Union"". This seems to be exactly what he tried to do, with the non-aggression pact.

The meme came about because of my anecdotal observations across Reddit.

I constantly see Europeans complain about Americans, America. 

Yet they surround themselves with literally hundreds of thousands and millions Americans on an American website, and then complain about how American it is.

I figured the complaints are at least slightly ironic?

562,"Spaniards are not obsessed with communism and left-wing ideology. 

In fact, the Communist Party barely got into Spain's parliament this last election by piggybacking on their sympathizers in the *Unidas Podemos* party (who are left-wing populists, but not generally communists), which is honestly kind of pathetic. 

There is a history of political radicalism being a strong force in southern Europe, but this includes both left and right wing radicals. This is for a variety of reasons, perhaps most prominently that Spain, Italy, and Greece all had long histories of political violence and authoritarianism before achieving stable democratic governance. There's also been a higher degree of economic instability.

I wouldn't say the hard-left is ""gaining power"", either. There was a huge upsurge in support for left-wing extremism during and after the financial crisis, but as economies have stabilized, *most* people seem to have lost interest in radical economic proposals. In Greece, for example, the left-populist *SYRIZA* was voted out last summer and replaced with the centre-right *Nea Dimokratia* party. *Unidas Podemos* managed to squeeze into Spain's current coalition government, including putting a single communist minister in the cabinet. 

The migrant crisis also energized the hard-right throughout the region. For instance, Italy is currently barely staving off a government led by the hard-right *Lega Nord* through a tenuous coalition between the centre-left *Partitio Democratico* and the populist *Movimento 5 Stelle*. Greece also had literal neo-Nazis in parliament for most of the past decade, though they thankfully lost all their seats in last summer's election.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/icqmlw/spanish_communist_party_shows_its_support_of/g260c5t/,jogarz,1597886284

574,"It should be obvious why he asked EU not to interfere. Yes, you're in part right, he doesn't want other countries to get into the habit of ousting dictators. 

However, as evil he is, he's still right. Countries need to fuck off and mind their business more often. Rampant interventionism is never a good thing. Countries never actually interfere to do a good thing, that's not how geopolitics work. Everything is done for money and your strategic benefit. 

To set a precedent for intervening in countries whenever someone arbitrarily decides someone to overstep the bounds of tyranny will not lead to a better world. Where is Libya now? Did the West intervene in Bolivia for a good cause or to get some access to natural resources on previously protected indigenous land? 

Point is, intervening in regime changes is dangerous. Belarusian people can handle this -- and if they cannot, foreign powers stepping in militarily won't help. 

That being said, if EU can sanction Lukashenka without affecting common people of Belarus too much, it would not be bad. Economic sanctions are a polite, yet very effective way of curbing regimes.

636,"&gt;Scotland would have the luxury of negotiating time to secure a trade deal

I don't think they would. Scottish independence would mean a new currency. That currency would inevitably depreciate because Scotland has a very large budget deficit and a very large trade deficit.

So from the moment Scotland voted for independence until independence day itself Scotland would be using a currency (the pound) that everyone knows would be replaced by a new, lower valued currency after independence. That means banks wouldn't want to issue mortgages in Scotland, businesses wouldn't want to invest, savers would want to move their money out of Scotland.

On top of that the UK government would almost certainly end the current system that results in Scotland getting an extra £10 billion a year of public spending. So from shortly after the independence vote the Scottish government would have a massive shortfall in revenue which they couldn't address by printing money and any borrowing they did to make up the difference would be in another country's currency.

The Scottish government would be desperate to get the independence negotiations done as quickly as possible.",,/r/europe/comments/icmivv/latest_panelbase_poll_puts_support_for_scottish/g25k7i1/,WhiteSatanicMills,1597877580

translated by DeepL:

Derailed train: almost 10 km unmanned.   
Engineer and train conductor got off at the previous station.  
The derailment near the Carnate-Usumate station in Brianza.

It travelled for almost 10 km from Paderno d'Adda (Lecco) to Carnate (Monza and Brianza) station without service personnel on board the train which derailed this morning causing the injury of the only passenger present in the wagons. In fact, the driver and the train conductor got off at the station of Paderno to take a break, and the train then started to run, probably taking advantage of a slight slope present in that section. Travelling at low speed, it arrived at the next station, where it was diverted by RFI's technicians on a dead track where it then stopped. Engineer and train conductor were assisted by the AREU at Paderno d'Adda station after minor injuries for causes still to be ascertained.  

The Monza Public Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation for culpable railway disaster, at the moment against unknown persons. The investigation is coordinated by Public Prosecutor Michele Trianni and Chief Prosecutor Claudio Gittardi. The investigators will wait for Polfer's report, which is making inquiries into the case, and then, if necessary, they will make entries in the register of suspects.  

Long waits for the replacement buses of the Milano-Lecco-Sondrio and Milano-Paderno Robbiate lines scheduled to leave from Monza station, due to the derailment of a train at Carnate station. For passengers who reached Brianza airport by train before 3 p.m., the first useful replacement bus left in the direction of Paderno Robbiate at 4 p.m. No bus left in the meantime in the direction of Lecco. Passengers also complain about the lack of information on where to wait for the bus. The train conductors indicate to wait for them ""in the station square on platform 1"", but in the station there are neither directions nor people able to direct them.

I've written many sentences providing solutions. 
Who says most of the countries claiming to be developed and humanistically led are the most patriotic ones? The last time I checked any survey on patriotism, Turkey is always way higher than developed countries. (And I guess no matter what the countries claim, being developed or not has objective criteria that everyone agrees on.) 
Nobody is criticizing teaching history, but teaching only the good parts and then glorifying everything without any kind of critical thinking will just create people who love their country but do things that are harming the country. (As they have been doing for years.) 
This country has enough of emotinal patriotism, we need logical people who can see what is right and wrong in their country, because too much pride is the enemy of development. The Ottoman Empire fell because they weren't able to see what was going wrong, we have to stop thinking criticism is a bad thing. As long as the objective of criticism isn't only to criticize, but to actually fix something, it's the key to development. 
You can't fix something that you think isn't broken. (But of course anyone who looks at PISA results can understand Turkish education system is deeply broken.) Not even mentioning that most of Turkish students can't show Poland (or Austria, or Japan) on the map, or will have no idea, after 12 years of education, about the slave trade in the Ottoman Empire.

975,"&gt;It isn't when the Parliament voted against the extension and you were trying to explain how only ""anti-EU"" countries were to blame for it.

The European Commission opened the extension up to a vote before representatives of European member states. Representarives of the member states voted 18-9 in favor of an extension. The Parliament can only make propositions for phase-outs, which ultimately is implemented/decided by national councils and/or the European Council. That's my whole gripe. The parliament should decide on these matters. Not some representatives of national institutions. Also, the parliament should be transnational to truly represent political opinion beyond borders. The European Council should be replaced with an Upper Chamber of regions/Senate. That's the way towards progress, not just leaving every ultimate decision to the whims of a handfull of politicians that don't have the interests of Europe as a whole at heart. Among the 18 countries, you have many of the usual suspects of course, like the Visegrads. 

&gt;Germany is one of the most pro-EU countries there is.

As a German I disagree. For the past 20 years that has simply not been true. 

&gt;If you think that Merkel is against the EU I'm not quite sure what tell you ...

I am not quite sure what to tell you either. If you believe platitudes and empty words that's kind of on you. She is not against the EU per se but she is definitely not enthusiastically in favor of it. CxU representatives do the bare minimum to keep the thing running for Germany's benefit. That's why we gifted you a nationally burnt politician as a figurehead of the EU. Von der Leyen got the job because no one liked her in Germany, because Orban and friends were more alright with someone carrying the label ""conservative"" and because she was important for German party politics. Literally no other reason. 

&gt;Yes, and they didn't so please explain to me again about how we should increase their power when they already fuck up in simple co-operation cases.

We should increase the power of the parliament and uncouple the European Commission from national decisionmakers, like for example the German agriculture minister shouldn't be the pivotal decisionmaker for a *European* law. Same as how Orban shouldn't have the final say over who is the President of the European Commission. I seriously don't get how you can't understand my argument.

1020,"&gt; Today TUT.BY has received information that Russian specialists have been attracted to the places of the striking Belarusian employees of Belteleradiocompany.
Let us remind you that the passage along Makaenka Street to the television building is closed on both sides. Only BT employees are allowed near him.
Director of Belteleradiocompany Alena Martinovskaya told TUT.BY that she was not allowed to work today. Probably due to the collective appeal to the leadership that she signed. The girl also spoke about Russian specialists who are now working at BT.

&gt; Information about Russians from the very morning comes from various sources.
“Yesterday afternoon, about six people came to our video engineers,” said one of the employees who participates in the strike. - They were interested in the work of our installation complex. The management among themselves discusses out loud that these are Russians who came to work from Moscow. As our guys report, the Russians will have a social package and a salary of 5 thousand rubles. For understanding: Belarusian specialists receive from one thousand to one and a half thousand rubles for such work, - said the interlocutor.
We talked with the correspondent of the Russian TV channel RT Konstantin Pridybailo , whom the journalists of Belteleradiocompany saw in the building these days.
He explained that he had been in Minsk for two weeks already - both for personal matters and for workers, as an RT correspondent.
- I have not seen any other Russian journalists at Belteleradiocompany. Yes, I was there, talked with some of my friends, colleagues, now leaders. They are really looking for people for vacant places in the market - in Russia, in Ukraine, because some Belarusians are leaving, some are on strike. Well, it is their right to look for employees - journalism is a rather migration profession. I myself do not work for BT and do not plan to, I have not received any offers.

Any intelligent person is able to see that the protests and then the  riots were two successive events, not one and the same. 

The democrats do the exact same conflating, calling the nightly riots in portland peaceful, calling the looting in other cities like chicago peaceful.

&gt; When he sends federal troops to attack peaceful protesters and arrest  them without any grounds? You can't deny this, there are hundreds of  videos showing such events in Portland. Of course they complain about  it, rightly so. 

Those troops were there due to antifa thugs attacking a federal courthous every goddamn night and yea throwing people into unmarked vans is going way too far but there also have been plenty of democrats complaining when trump send those federal troops to protect federal property but these same people turn around and also blame trump for not doing enough about the rioting.",,/r/europe/comments/ic8hvf/ny_gov_cuomo_calls_covid19_the_european_virus/g23vkl3/,Jodike,1597848743

there is no shooting down of a greek pilot in 1995 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_shootdowns#Aegean_dispute

&gt;Roundel of Turkey.svg Οn 8 February 1995, a Turkish F-16C crashed on the sea after being intercepted by a Greek Mirage F1CG. The Turkish pilot Mustafa Yildirim bailed out and was rescued by a Greek helicopter. After brief hospitalization in Rhodes, the pilot was handed over to the Turkish side.[33] It can be considered a maneuvering kill by the Mirage F1 .
&gt;Roundel of Turkey.svg On 27 December 1995, a pair of Greek F-16Cs intercept a pair of Turkish F-4E. During the dogfight that followed, one of the Turkish aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into the sea, killing its pilot Altug Karaburun. The co-pilot Ogur Kilar managed to bail out safely and was rescued by a Greek ΑΒ-205 helicopter. He was returned to Turkey after receiving first aid treatment in Lesbos.[33]
&gt;Roundel of Turkey.svgOn 8 October 1996 – 7 months after the escalation of the dispute with Turkey over the Imia/Kardak islands, a Greek Mirage 2000 fired an R.550 Magic II missile and shot down a Turkish F-16D[34] over the Aegean Sea. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces.[35] In August 2012, after the downing of a RF-4E on the Syrian Coast, Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz confirmed that the Turkish F-16D was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 with an R.550 Magic II in 1996 after reportedly violating Greek airspace near Chios island.[36] Greece denies that the F-16 was shot down.[37] Both Mirage 2000 pilots reported that the F-16 caught fire and they saw one parachute.[38]

Cute. 

The Commission is anti-European. They represent the wishes of their population to not improve the EU and disregard its authority perfectly fine. If the people in the Visegrad countries wouldn't have voted for people like Orban or the PiS party, the European Parliament and the the European Council would have agreed on a more democratically elected candidate. 

But because the European Council is vested with too many powers, a handful of its members roadblocked the whole process and forced someone who wasn't even running for the election into the position of President of the European Commission. That was a decision that the governments of European member states made to deligitimize the whole EU process. And after the fact you have all these people who voted for these politicians and parties who pulled that stunt, crying about how the EU is broken and undemocratic anyways.

The Commission could be perfectly democratic, if the European Parliament was the one actually electing the office, instead of just getting sidelined by the European Council whenever its convenient. If people in European member states wpuld vote more pro-European politicians/parties, the Council would be more willing to accept or even expand the authority of the European Parliament and the EU would be perfectly democratic.",,/r/europe/comments/ic2ch5/belarus_gives_the_eu_a_chance_to_show/g2374tk/,Kuchendieb07,1597834158

1365,"&gt; University of Cambridge anthropologist Nora Weller told the Pristina-based KTV that the status of the Visoki Decani monastery has become a complex issue because of the behavior of the Kosovo authorities who have to prove that they can protect the Serb community and its cultural heritage, the KoSSev news portal reported on Wednesday.

&gt; A dispute broke out recently between Abbot Sava Janjic and the local authorities over the construction of a road part of which is to be built in the protected area close to the 14th century Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC) monastery with Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti stepping in calling for the construction of the road to stop temporarily. The dispute also drew comments from Belgrade.

&gt; “The issue of the monastery and its status in Kosovo is very complex and that complexity comes from the time of (UN peace negotiator Finnish politician Martti) Ahtisaari but it goes even deeper since the local authorities were never diplomatic and the necessary professionalism in their relations with the Church. Moreover, the central authorities in Kosovo did not tackle church issues with the seriousness it deserves and I don’t know why but the SPC is constantly being pushed aside,” Professor Weller is quoted as saying.

&gt; She said that the SPC and its churches and monasteries will be one of the main issues in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue because, according to her, it’s clear that the Church is fighting for its status. She added that no public figure or official in Kosovo has never stood up to protect the church leaving the impression that Kosovo is not really taking care of it.

&gt; Weller said that the latest dispute is proof that Kosovo is incapable of implementing its own laws to protect communities as it promised to do leaving the church to do other things which are not within its powers. The Kosovo authorities, local and central, have to prove that they can protect the SPC as it was defended for centuries, they have to prove that the Serb community is protected along with its cultural heritage, Weller said.  ",Ljubljana (Slovenia) 🇸🇮/🇭🇷,/r/europe/comments/ick27m/cambridge_university_professor_says_kosovo_has_to/g230p6v/,CrystalMaterelius,1597827325

1413,"&gt;Wrong. When discussing minorities, use actual minorities in your examples. This only point invalidates the rest of your comment, but ill debunk the rest too. Just so you get it.

It is, since we aren't discussing the matter of actual minorities, but your hypocrisy. You are just a nationalist, it's that simple.

&gt;'Dutch influence''? Belgium has been independent for a couple of generations, my friend. You mean the influence of the Dutch langauge? Well ofcourse. Its up to the Belgians how they organize their society and country. For all i care they speak only in sign language from now on. They have chosen to separe it trough 2 state governments with each their governments. Kinda innefficient, but if thats what they want.

You didn't address the point. Try addressing the point.

&gt;This gibberish is going against what the current accepted norm is among historians. Its rather insane you portray it as an argument. And dont come at me with the bullshit like Catalonia or anything like that. It would only show how little you know about European history.

Tell me about this accepted norm among historians, I will wait.

Also, no, not Catalonia. I'll bring up Northern England and Midlands. Those people have less and less in common with one another, from common problems to identity. This is a process of regionalism, same with France. Toulhose region is nothing like Picardie or Ile De France, they are only really united through language. People slowly cease to identify with a bigger understanding of a nation and nationality, that's a fact.

&gt;Yeaaaah, sorry. Im gonna believe the historians and well, human history, over some random reddit commentor who clearly knows jack shit about this subject.

Tell me about those historians, point at them. So far you are the only one throwing words to the wind.

""Russian President Vladimir Putin has told his German and French counterparts Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron that any attempt by outside forces to intervene in the political crisis in Belarus would be counterproductive.
In two separate phone calls on Tuesday, initiated by Berlin and Paris, Putin stressed that placing external pressure on the leadership in Minsk is unacceptable. Russia and Belarus have formal military and political alliances, via the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and a 'union state' agreement. 

According to the German side, Chancellor Merkel told Putin that Alexander Lukashenko's government must stop using violence against peaceful demonstrators, enter into a dialogue with the opposition, and immediately release political prisoners.

The chancellor's comments came amid various discussions among European Union members about how to address the situation in Belarus. EU ministers agreed last Friday to draw up a list of targets for a new round of sanctions, and politicians in Poland and Lithuania, and other states, have pushed for interventions, to various degrees.

“The parties thoroughly discussed the situation in Belarus following the presidential election,” the Kremlin statement read. “Russia pointed out that foreign attempts to interfere in the country’s domestic affairs were unacceptable and could further escalate tensions.”

“Hope was expressed that the situation will improve as soon as possible,” it concluded.

Later the same day, a second call took place with President Macron, in which Libya was also discussed. 

“When discussing the complicated situation in Belarus, Vladimir Putin stressed that interference in the internal affairs of the republic and putting pressure on the Belarusian leadership would be unacceptable,"" the Kremlin explained. ""Both sides expressed a desire for an early solution to the problems that have arisen.""

Belarus is arguably Russia's closest ally and is a full member of two Moscow-dominated alliances which serve as alternatives to the EU and NATO in Europe – the EEU and the CTSO, in addition to the ‘union state’ agreement.

By contrast with some of the rhetoric from Western Europe, the official response from Moscow has been measured. Numerous Russian experts have expressed the view that the Kremlin would prefer if the situation in Belarus did not become another ‘East versus West’ geopolitical struggle.""",,/r/europe/comments/ic0js1/lithuanian_parliament_declares_lukashenko_not/g229j09/,squirrelbrain,1597805824

But that leads to a question: by what mechanism did all that US wealth shift to these countries? Are you really suggesting that the US government just poured money into them? Because if so, that would represent an _incredible_ act of charity: raising a whole swathe of countries in both Europe and Asia, including recent enemies, not just _out_ of abject need and fear of famine, but all the way to fierce economic rivals with high living standards. That would be an amazing and unprecedented act of generosity.

If, on the other hand, it _wasn't_ simple generosity then it must have been trade: the West Germans and French and Japanese and Koreans and Taiwanese simply produced stuff that Americans and others wanted and sold it to them, effectively redistributing wealth and raising quality of life in all countries.

""In the six days after top Chinese officials secretly determined they likely were facing a pandemic from a new coronavirus, the city of Wuhan at the epicenter of the disease hosted a mass banquet for tens of thousands of people; millions began traveling through for Lunar New Year celebrations.

“This is tremendous,” said Zuo-Feng Zhang, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “If they took action six days earlier, there would have been much fewer patients and medical facilities would have been sufficient. We might have avoided the collapse of Wuhan’s medical system.”

If the public had been warned a week earlier to take actions such as social distancing, mask wearing and travel restrictions, cases could have been cut by up to two-thirds, [one paper later found](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843v3.full.pdf). An earlier warning could have saved lives, said Zhang, the doctor in Los Angeles.

Doctors and nurses in Wuhan [told Chinese media](http://archive.vn/OLdHs#selection-871.108-890.0) there were plenty of signs that the coronavirus could be transmitted between people as early as late December.

“Everybody in the country in the infectious disease field knew something was going on,” she said, declining to be named to avoid disrupting sensitive government consultations. “They were anticipating it.”'

If you don't have that, you have to re-adapt the economy through political measures. For that you need a well-functioning government (which neither Greece nor Turkey nor any country that puts itself in this kind of situation have).

1855,"The maps I linked of course are tools and have no legal claims. I never said that. I used them as tools to explain how between UNCLOS, existing treaties and the use a median (equidistant) line the EEZ’s should look as per a non-profit organization. If I made you think that I implied that these show the true EEZ, or how it should be in the end of the arbitration, it wasn’t my intention. I just think this should be the basis of discussion (the median) and start from there. I don’t think kastellorizo should get all 200nm but I don’t think turkey is right at all to start from a 12nm (iirc) basis.

Equidistance is correctly not mentioned for the EEZ, but it is for the territorial waters. As you claim, equity is instead the term used, its true. As per the link listed in the previous comment from the ministry of affairs of turkey, turkey claims that kastellorizo and Cyprus should have a 12nm (I think) EEZ. I don’t consider this equity. The commentator before mentioned kastellorizo’s inhabitants and distance. This also is not mentioned at all at UNCLOS. If you translate equity as measured and quantified by inhabitants and distance, then please provide the numbers. Otherwise it’s up to ICJ to consider what it considers as equity.

1893,"Here are some important points for me:

- Turkey shouldn't have a role in United Cyprus. (Obviously Greece and UK shouldn't have a role either). You are a Turk. You have a dictator now, I don't want a guy like Erdogan to have a say in the internal politics of Cyprus. That means Turkey can't remain a guarantor power. I believe it's not unreasonable to want a truly independent and sovereign Cyprus.

- All foreign armies must go. I can't feel safe when there are 40.000 turkish soldiers. Again I believe this is understandable. UN, UNFICYP, EU, Security Council should make sure everyone feels safe.

- A big number of refugees can return. I think it's agreed a number of around 90.000 (so this is not a main area of disagreement between the two sides).

- Famagusta and Morphou should be in the GC zone

- Cyprus must act as a single country. Outside of Cyprus I want it to just be Cyprus. A single international personality.

- About political equality, I am okay with equal representation in the Senate, I am okay with TCs having a higher representation in the Lower Parliament. I am not sure about the one positive vote on every issue(since I fear this will lead to dysfunction)

- I am even willing to accept rotating presidency(but that's something that most people disagree with me)

- The Republic of Cyprus will transform from a unitary state to a federation

- All Cypriots are able to live, work, buy property, open business in any part of Cyprus. I mean what kind of country forbid its citizens to move freely and live freely wherever they want? I can live and work in any place I want in EU, I want to be able to do that in my country(Annan plan didn't allow that)

- I personally want to keep the flag of Cyprus the same. It was designed by a Turkish Cypriot and represents everything Cyprus should have",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/ic3acn/cyprus_says_willing_to_engage_on_defining/g21lkyw/,Bran37,1597792743

2013,"CONTEXT before yet another comment section turns into a pool of blind hate:

First off I don't support Turkey's actions, nor am I a citizen of Turkey or Greece. I also don't particularly want to do this, but someone has to. To the point:

Turkey is illegaly conducting seismic research in a region currently recognized as Greek EEZ waters. It's actually **legal for their warships to be there** as the EEZ only restricts **economic activity.** The Turkish warship escort can sail through those waters all it wants, their research ship the Oruc Reis can't do research as that is considered economic activity. It is important to note that the Greek EEZ is outlined by [UNCLOS](https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf) \- a treaty ratified by 167 countries, but not Turkey and the USA.

Again - what is illegal here is the research done by the Oruc Reis - the warships can sail through there legally.

Turkey is saying that the area they are currently doing research in should be theirs as the island of Kastellorizo is far too small to warrant such a big EEZ - and they are probably right. [The red outline](https://i.imgur.com/81IM0O0.jpg) shows the absolute minimum of what Turkey would get from the area if it went to international court (**while being forced to make concessions elsewhere)** based on [previous precedents](https://i.imgur.com/81IM0O0.jpg) and this is taking into account that Kastellorizo is part of the Greek archipelago, that's why it would still get a massive area of EEZ compared to its size - connected to the rest of the archipelago.

**The problem** is that Turkey is not pressing its claim in international court, but is doing it illegaly with a warship escort. This is also one of many such incidents and it's starting to really build up.

Finally - Erdogan: r/europe always likes to upvote the sensationalist articles from the nuggets he throws for his extreme base, but we never get the full speeches where he talks about [wanting dialogue and diplomacy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE3mf_YJUnk&amp;t=149s)

Again - I am not affiliated or a fan of the Turkish regime. I think Erdogan is bad and I do not agree with Turkish foreign policy, but things are getting ridiculous in this sub.

Blindly antagonizing turks with sensationalist propaganda is making things worse and moving us away from a solution. Furthermore I'd ask any incel level idiot that going to war over seismic research is a good idea - go speak with some Yugoslav war victims or in fact go to Turkey and speak to the most recently ethnically cleansed muhacirs (from my country btw) and learn what the consequences of war and conflicts based on ethnic hate really are before coming on r/europe and spewing retarded bullshit.

edit: I forgot to mention - before anyone accuses me of wanting to appease Turkey - I think they should be sanctioned for these actions and sanctioned more if they continue. The EU can sanction Turkey into oblivion, especially in its current state.

2026,"We are also doing massive amounts of testing these days. País Vasco, Catalunya, Madrid, and Aragón were signficantly  [increasing the number of PCR tests](http://www.telemadrid.es/coronavirus-covid-19/Carabanchel-Usera-Villaverde-contagios-coronavirus-0-2260273966--20200818073006.html) and, in Madrid anyway, were targeting a younger demographic in some of the hardest hit areas of the region for a random PCR test. While the shockvalue of seeing the numbers is not pleasant by any stretch of the imagination, it's reasonable to see that there's an increase attributed to more extensive testing compared to where we were a few months ago. 

Also, on the other hand, you have to look at how Spain is structured: once the State of Emergency ended, all power was given back to the Autonomous Communities (CCAA). The CCAA, up until a few days go, were left to their own devices on how to handle and implement measures pertaining to health and hygiene. This is why there was a lack of implementing masks amongst the country -- Madrid (where I live) was one of the last CCAA to make the mask mandatory whereas other CCAA had, had it mandatory weeks prior. The Canary Islands was the [last CCAA to make it completely compulsory](https://www.eldia.es/canarias/2020/08/13/mascarilla-obligatoria-canarias-espacios/1101145.html). 

It was only with the spike in numbers that the Ministry of Health came out with [eleven measures and three suggestions](https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2020/08/14/5f369e5efdddfffa3a8b461d.html) to try and curb the numbers from exploding. Regardless, the CCAA have not implemented them all at the same time but have the expectation to do so within the next few days. They cannot really do any more without the Central Government declaring another State of Alarm and assuming control again--something that would not sit well after we went through so many extensions and the more right-winged parties threatened to not vote in favour of it. 

Then you have to look at the enforcement of the rules that the CCAA implement: yes, in Madrid it's mandatory to wear a mask even when you can maintain the social distancing, but I see teenagers wandering about with the mask on their elbow or with their noses exposed. There's just a simple lack of enforcement and until there's a tangible punishment (aka, a fine), people will continue to disobey because they can get away with it. It's immensely frustrating because the virus spreads like wildfire, but there's a very misconstrued relationship with the Spanish public and the police. Even as of today, the Balearic Islands had said that partying on boats was prohibited... yet people were out partying on boats with little consequence and it was documented all over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Lucia_Bohorquez/status/1295773006632034304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1295773006632034304%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felpais.com%2Fsociedad%2F2020-08-18%2Fultimas-noticias-del-coronavirus-en-espana-y-en-el-mundo-en-directo.html).  

One could argue that Spain opened the borders too early, we wanted that tourism money because the country's economy is so dependent on foreign tourists flocking to the beaches and coasts: but it goes beyond that. There's a lack of uniform consistency in policy implementation, a lot of bad calls have been made (letting clubs open, for example), and just dirty Spanish politics and manipulation that have contributed to a lot of the spikes in numbers. I can only speak for Madrid, but our regional government assured the Central Government we were ready to move onto the next phases back in May in June, saying we were completely prepared, but now the regional President is trying to bounce the responsibility back to the Central Government, saying they need to take charge of areas like the re-opening of schools, the airport and screening, etc.

Just because one guy said that, it doesn't make it true. He also had said before that the USSR was inherently expansionist.

If you care, read about Russia's history, especially in regards to Eastern Europe. They have participated 3 times in dividing Poland. They invaded neighbors over and over and over again.

Their history has been expansionist and imperialist, and the same principles still guide their external policies.

Sure, they claim they do it for ""defensive"" reasons. Like when they invaded Finland to ""defend"" Leningrad (at the time, now St Petersburg). As if it was Finland's problem or responsibility Russia decided to have a city in that place. Tough titties. Move your fuckin city inland, if you don't like its position.

In fact, just look at a map. Russia is the biggest country in the world. You don't get that big without being an imperialist shitstain.

And yes, there's plenty of proof Russia acted up without reason. The ""NATO expanders"" are right. Because they have experienced Russian ""defensive"" policies.

&gt;You keep using the term historical minorities. All it truly means is a minority that has failed to integrate into society for generations and generations. You act like if its somehow something we should cherish and protect. Weird stance.

Because during those times there were less opportunities to migrate and people felt the need to not integrate within the bigger nation group. The world is currently going through the procesd of regionalism. People in their respectible regions within the nation feel less and less belonging to the broader understanding of a nation. People of Southern Poland have less in common with Northern Poland, some more diverse regions cease to identify themselves with polishness.

&gt;She said the meeting allowed her to understand much better what had been happening in the east of Ukraine, what the security situation was like there,"" Kuleba said. ""The statement that Germany will support the rapprochement of Ukraine with NATO was very clear
[-Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Federal Ministry of Defence ](https://www.unian.info/politics/nato-membership-most-members-support-ukraine-s-accession-to-eop-11021423.html )

Considering Germany did let go of 10 000 NATO troops it doesn't seem like they want to keep on that ""free"" defense all that much. The whole NATO situation is also much more complex.

It is quite understandable that average Western European has no interest on supporting armies that they don't often even see as their own. Rather the only time the NATO defense pact was activated was for US to use other armies to get oil. It is quite obvious why people have no interest on voting people that want to increase military spending when the money is going mainly to that.

When European countries set more mechanism to spend more, but of course want to prompt more R&amp;D and equipment manufacturing internally - US usually directly attacks against those plans. 
Example 14 billion euro procurement project by EU to increase joint purchasing of military equipment and R&amp;D spending. This resulted into a warning letter from Ellen Lord (Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Sustainment) and Andrea L. Thompson (Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs) last year to stop the project as there was fears for EU countries buying less US equipment. US could care less about defense in Europe. It's just moving money to different pockets.

2270,"' Factory farming of livestock is a particular problem for Europe. This system is responsible for 85 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector. This is equal to 13 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions if land use and land use change emissions are included.  
Factory farming is a major consumer of global cereal stocks. European factory farming sucks up about two thirds of European cereal production, as well as millions of tonnes of cereals from abroad. This has major knock-on impacts on global supplies of food. It also leads to millions of hectares of land being grabbed in South America. '

2275,"Allow me to let you in on a secret, cutie pie. We know. Everybody with a functioning pair of eyes is aware of the fact that politicians do politics and that it's all a part of a campaign, or a game, or an internal struggle, or some other stuff that happens in politics. However - pay attention, because this is where the differences begin - instead of a persistent, insufferable need to be smarter than others we possess a certain amount of empathy. And that means when we see things like state-supported hate campaigns and persecution of minorities, or depriving domestic violence victims of millions which are then given to lunatics or spent on praising medieval worldviews, we are loud about it. Because these people's suffering is real and they do not deserve to suffer, or at the very least they need to know they are not forgotten. And if you ignore this suffering just because it's a byproduct of politics it doesn't make you smarter or less prone to manipulation; it makes you a sociopathic dickhead who doesn't care about anyone else than yourself. And believe me when I tell you, from the bottom of my heart, it's not impressive. Not one bit.

2342,"Eh yes. Just rhyming off numbers of personnel and ships isn’t a remotely accurate way of determining what the better navy is. If that was decent logic then North Korea would have one of the best militaries in the world.

For example, starting with aircraft, the F-35 is much superior to the dated French Rafale. The new Type 26 frigate is commonly regarded as the best anti-submarine ship of any navy in the world. The Type 45 destroyer is also widely regarded as just about the best anti-air ship of any navy in the world. The 2 QE class carriers alone can deploy over 100 F-35s and are state of the art carriers that mean the UK can project power all over the globe in a minimum of two locations. The Charles de Gaulle is good but it’s not quite the same level, and there’s only one of them. Only the Ford and Nimitz class carriers are regarded as similar or better.

А у нас, думаешь, как? Когда протесты шли по нарастающей - о них, кроме как через телегу, вообще не было никакой информации нигде. Ну вообще. Однако народ встал.

В том-то и дело, что всякие «скакания» для сугрева в Киеве (с существованием их ты хоть спорить не будешь?) и прочая, и прочая - очень легко создавали картинку которую элементарно было скормить восточным регионам. Если бы у нас присутствовало хотя бы 5% того, что происходило на майдане - в жизни бы МАЗ, МТЗ, Азот и прочие не вышли. Ноль шансов. Соответственно решение о региональной «базе» протестов было принято изначально.

&gt;Когда наемники Гиркина захватили Славянкск то стало ясно что если не начать отбиваться то и те регионы РФ отберет.

Да ладно там наёмники Гиркина. Ты же не будешь спорить что подавляющее большинство там сейчас никакие не Гиркины? Да, кукловоды из-за границы были, но для того чтоб у них что-либо получилось нужна хоть какая-то почва...

&gt;Не думаю что переубежу, но это моя точка зрения

Да в том то и дело, что я не спорю с тем, что Янык был сволочью и тряпкой. Дело в том, что те кто пришли на смену - не сильно (если вообще) лучше и результаты на лицо. Могли бы и дождаться 15-го и просто спокойно избрать нового, без эксцессов или максимум с чем-то на подобие первого, «оранжевого» майдана.

*Then don't do it to other people.* If everyone agrees there is no need for a god.

Only if not everyone agrees you have to involve a god as a moral lifeline (""otherwise god will punish you"", ""kill the infidels"") -- and that's sad because it's a moral declaration of bankruptcy.

Certainly not religion in itself. There is no correlation between immoral behaviour and whether a population is religious or atheist. Morality and religion are even two different things. Being atheist or religious just is whether you don't believe or believe in the existence of a god.             
        
Morality is an emergent property of people living together and (negatively) not stealing from, hurting, killing others at the slightest selfish impulse, or (positively) helping others when it seems they're in need of help.

Rome is really great if you’re interested in archeological stuff, Ancient Rome structures as well as catholic related buildings (Vatican for example) and renaissance constructions. Rome is built on many hills, with the Tiber flowing through it. It’s not really easy to use transportation inside the city, at least not as easy as in Paris.

Paris is more oriented on the 19th century architecture (Haussmann, art nouveau), with some older structures (renaissance or gothic).
The Seine really divide the city in two areas that are distinct. There is more diversity in the museum you could visit. Paris is somewhat more expensive.

Parliament rejected the move, and some members initiated the procedure of impeachment for breach of constitution. This was supported by the West.

A group of top officials headed by the then Russian premier minister Chernomyrdin flew in from Moscow to mediate in the negotiations. The result of which was, Lukashenko agreed to declare results of the referendum not legally binding, merely consultative, and in return the impeachment bill was withdrawn.

After the referendum which was believed to be rigged, Lukashenko received virtually unlimited power and declared referendum legally binding after all. Since then, the parliament has been in his pocket.

Yes I do believe the Germans are there for the Natural Gas.  I also believe they would do business with Satan himself, provided he was able to deliver on that which keeps their industry going.  They will deal with Putin, the Vory or whomever replaces the current system.

&gt; Why do you think the ex-cancelor of Germany now rules half of the Russian oil industry?

Hmm.  I would call that a bribe, a payoff or a “golden parachute” depending on whom we are to assume he was working for in the first place.

&gt; Why the EU let Russia control more than 40% of the gas and oil market in Europe?

&gt; Why France and Germany have blocked Ukraine's and Georgia's way to NATO not long ago?

You present this as two questions, but in reality it is only one, rhetorical, question, or maybe the answer followed by the question.

A simple T-62 (realistically T-62M) might not be able to duel Leo2 or even any late second generation tank for that matter, but against a simple infantry unit holding a position it is still a menace. Marginally good crew will be able to shell the enemy from multiple positions (the main advantage of a tank is its mobility, essentially a gun that can change position fast). 100mm HE shells are more than capable to kill and destroy field fortifications. HEAT shells will not penetrate any modern tank, but they will penetrate light vehicles, APCs, house walls, etc. ATGMs are not a panacea - unless you use high-range fire&amp;forget missiles such as newer Javelins and Spikes (which are expensive and not fielded in great numbers by European armies), a single good tank crew will almost always overcome a single good ATGM team. Shells will reach the latter much faster than the missile can reach the tank, but again, the most important advantage of a tank in a duel scenario is its mobility and ability to strike from many positions.

However the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly. A process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly underway during the reigns of Domnall and his successors.

That did happen in World War II in Finland and IIRC that in turn followed prior incidents (Spanish Republican War?), but I'm not actually sure how viable that is with modern tanks.

I did see video footage of people in Ukraine launching Molotov cocktails against an APC, though I don't know how effective that was, and that's not a tank.

Which isn't to say that your broader point about tank vulnerability to infantry-portable weapons isn't valid, just that I think that the bar to destroy a tank may be higher than ""guy with a beer bottle and a gasoline pump"" today.

EDIT: Yeah, [Wikipedia says that they were used to destroy tanks in the Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail#Spanish_Civil_War).

EDIT2: Also, note that I'm assuming that the tank is buttoned up here -- if I remember correctly from one of my books on the Winter War, Molotov cocktails were used on the air intake then.  If the tank has open hatches, I assume that one could drop all sorts of unpleasant things in -- firebombs, grenades, industrial explosives, whatever -- that the tank crew would be vulnerable to, even with a modern tank.

EDIT3: Also from the WP [Molotov cocktail article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail):

&gt;There were many who were skeptical about the efficacy of Molotov cocktails and SIPs grenades against the more modern German tanks. Weapon designer Stuart Macrae witnessed a trial of the SIPs grenade at Farnborough: ""There was some concern that, if the tank drivers could not pull up quickly enough and hop out, they were likely to be frizzled to death, but after looking at the bottles they said they would be happy to take a chance.""[20] The drivers were proved right, trials on modern British tanks confirmed that Molotov and SIP grenades caused the occupants of the tanks ""no inconvenience whatsoever.""[21]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ibpub9/amount_of_tanks_per_100000_people/g1xkl9y/,duisThias,1597711647

Whereas in the second case, it initially follows UNCLOS, which Turkey rejects. Regardless their issue was if snake island was an island or an islet, which is not the case here.

I mean, even before the protests you couldn't walk through the center of Minsk without seeing at least a couple of squads patrolling the streets. Now there's none. Combined with people enjoying their freedom all over the place this felt refreshing and unusual.

Also, the complete absence of drunk or drinking people among the protesters. This is particularly amazing cuz [Belarusians actually are the most heavy drinking nation in the known Universe](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/alcohol-consumption-by-country). It took learning about massive election rigging, tortures and rapes for people to sober up.

No, you got it wrong, Greece is a democratic country where freedom of speech and the right to protest against your government still exist. Look at today's Turkey and tell me, what does any European country lack compared to that?

3002,"Firstly that is already a projection of what the European Union is; the fact that the UK, out of its own free-will and self-determination got in (even after geting vetoed by France) already poses some questions here.
The fact that every step of the way the UK was not only granted veto powers over new competences, but also exceptions to projects should they not want to join, plus the infamous British rebate, also poses more questions on these views.

I see the European Union as a project, and indeed you can leave or you can integrate even more; it is a choice and it must be reflected via democracy, as it's been done. The problem is that once you want to leave, but you consistently make your exit a drag and provide little to no certainty to key issues (like the Irish border, or migration rights), while vilifying your age-old trade partners and their immigrants, things start getting tense.

I'd have no problem with the UK just going ahead with Brexit should it have been carried with better views on what type of relationship is desirable for both sides, and is still mutually beneficial. Instead, we get a British government who elected a known liar as PM, and who, to this day, shares no interest in a mutually beneficial relationship with the EU.

I do not see Brexit as an act of hostility at all, the hostile actions the UK has caused that I see as problematic is the buffoons in charge of the British government, that constantly lie and attack EU institutions, often for their own personal gain and at the detriment of better relationships.

3078,"You contradict yourself, you can't even grasp 7th grade physics and you try to infer that I'm poorly educated lmao. Let's use these ""simple physics""  
Braking comes from friction which is entirely dependent on traction. An average F1 race car weighs around 700kg. 200 kph is quite fast for a corner, but let's keep that value for your sake. A typical Polish ambulance weighs around 3500 kg **when it's empty**. With all the equipment and fuel the weight would probably raise by around 400-500 kgs, but again, for your sake, and to keep it simple, let's say it's 3,5 t. According to Newton's laws of motion (the simplest of physics ;) ), the net acceleration acting upon a body equals the net force divided by the object's mass. If we assume that the braking force of both vehicles is equal (which is again a simplification in your favour), disregarding the reaction time (which obviously would be faster in case of a professional race driver) then the stopping distance for the ambulance will be **3 times** greater than the race car. Add to that the fact that a race driver knows perfectly when to stop and an ambulance would have to come to a halt only when he suddenly has to, for example when encountering a pedestrian (Krakowskie Przedmiescie is a popular pedestrian road).   That's why every bit of traction matters.

China has 1400 million people and their population has peaked and will start declining soon, while their economic growth rate will slow as they get richer.

&gt;Have you heard of Mongol invasion in Europe? Basically it was the Chinese invasion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mongols have founded a ruler dynasty in China.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beijing is founded by grandson on Genghis khan.  
&gt;  
&gt;Current Chinese people think that Mongols are a part of their civilization.

&amp;#x200B;

The Mongols were not Chinese and nobody in China thinks that Mongols were Chinese. This is a misreading of the Yuan dynasty. 

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Chinese invasion has happened in history. And that invasion has destroyed Europe for centuries. At least the Eastern part.

3187,"Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne or Munich: girls and women do not feel safe in any of these cities. One in five has been harassed at least once, felt watched or threatened, the study showed.

Girls and women do not always feel safe in big cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne or Munich, the NGO 'Kinderhilfswerk Plan' study based on an online survey found.

""Our study has clearly shown that girls and young women, also in large German cities, are sexually harassed, feel followed and threatened, are insulted,"" said the head of the organization, Maike Röttger. As she added, this is a situation in which they are denied the right to safely and freely move around the city to get to work or school, meet friends or simply go for a walk.

**The ""street"" is the most uncertain**

A thousand girls and women aged 16 to 71 participated in the survey between January and March 2020. On the interactive map they marked the so-called ""Pins"", places they took to be safe or unsafe for themselves.

A scene straight from life - an attack on a young woman at a Berlin metro station

The most insecure girls and women feel ""in the street"". Public transport and green areas are the next risky places for them. The feeling of uncertainty is caused primarily by meetings with groups of people under the influence of alcohol or drugs along the way, moreover, poorly lit roads and parks, and finally abandoned areas, where, if necessary, no help can be expected.

In Hamburg, girls and women feel the most insecure at the main station and on the Reeperbahn, in Cologne the city center, including Neumarkt, for example, received the most negative pins. On the map of Berlin, the participants of the survey never marked the Hauptbahnhof main station, but countless negative opinions were given to places where tourists gather, such as Alexanderplatz or the streets of Friedrichshain. In Munich, ladies found parks, including the English Garden, uncertain.

The analysis of the collected data showed that every fifth participant of the study has already been raped once, followed or threatened. ""Many girls and women are ashamed of not reporting to the police in such cases,"" says Mirko Streiber, head of the Hamburg State Criminal Police Office. While the # meto movement did improve things a bit, it could have been much better.

The English Garden - one of the most dangerous places for women in Munich

The survey showed that the need for action is still great, emphasizes Maike Röttger. Every girl and woman has the right to move around the city freely and without fear. Maike Röttger demands that city authorities take the necessary steps, including, for example, more or better lighting or the elimination of dark angles in parks. ""But it's just as important to move away from the roles assigned to each gender, which still suggest to many boys and men that it is perfectly okay to molest women,"" she argues. Stereotypes and discrimination are still deeply rooted in the general consciousness of the reasons why girls and women cannot feel safe.

The authors of the study note that its results are not representative. Its aim was rather to show ""subjective sense of security in big cities"". But thanks to the high number of study participants, general conclusions can also be drawn from it.",,/r/europe/comments/ibmt3d/women_in_german_metropolises_fear_of_going_out_on/g1ws8uq/,undivided01,1597698035

So Turks think if RoC is a standalone country, Turkish Cypriots should get a share (directly, not a savings account), if not they should recognize TRNC.

RoC recognizes the right of Turkish Cypriots to the resources and as you said their share of any profit will be stored and transferred after a solution. You can't honestly expect RoC to fund ""TRNC"" directly, unless you think Ukraine should pay Russia for annexing Crimea or Azerbaijan should fund Nagorno-Karabakh. Also another reason this cannot happen directly is the fact that we don't know the type of the possible solution. If the solution is a united federal republic then Turkish Cypriot should and would absolutely get every cent of their share. However, if the solution is a two state solution then Turkish Cypriots will logically be entitled to 0% of the profits from natural resources found SOUTH of Cyprus.

3366,"&gt;Кстати еще вопрос, Какое вообще твое отношение к самому Евромайдану?

В основном - отрицательное. И дело не в том, что наш ОМОН плохой, а ваш Беркут - хороший. Все «хороши». Дело в том, что устраивать революцию с кровопролитием из-за того, что реально избранный президент отказался подписывать международное соглашение - сон разума. Да и методы - пугали. Тут как раз об этом:

&gt;Я говорил что там все святые ? Кто помогал, кто-то нет, кто-то добивал.

Это вот для нас выглядит просто пещерной дикостью. Кто вам мешал поступить как мы после того как студентов в Киеве избили? Могли бы остановить заводы, шахты, выйти на забастовки... Нет, пошли пиздить Беркут арматурой, начали выплывать всякие Сашки Билые, которые с автоматами в облисполкомах угрожали... Да и ещё какие-то непонятные снайпера-провокаторы которых до сих пор не нашли, даже после победы (что ну дико подозрительно). В эффекте - получили три региона в минус.

Мы же, как раз, чисто ментально ближе всё таки именно к двум из этих трёх регионов (Крым - отдельная история, сам понимаешь). Конечно у них сейчас там полный пиздец, но что поделаешь? Началась война, пролилась кровь, разбомблены дома и автобусные остановки. Возвращать их теперь будет тяжело. 

Ну и вообще, так сказать, результаты не особо впечатляют. Нас ведь Лукашенко заебал уже тогда, но в 2015 мы честно за него проголосовали, просто от страха закончить как вы.

I think best would be having open signs at the entrance, very much like the movie warnings. So people can choose to support the business or not. Not at all different than some restaurants advertising halal food or having signs for payment methods. Or R rated superhero movies.

Well I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I would say this - as a community we have met the absolute shitty scum of cishet people. But we don't call the whole cishet community horrible awful people.  - so don't lump us all together 🤷‍♀️ (also compare you finding some members 'cringe' and that being enough to not support us - to us getting death threats and assaulted by people and we still don't lump you all together)

as for the ""norm"" - well we just are different😂, we have different minds and bodies to the rest of the 'normal people' so we cannot pretend to be like them. We exist, always have existed. Society doesn't want to accept people are different. - we know the science behind our existence, society just wants to live in a simple fantasy where everyone is the same (ignoring science)

I think it's pretty disrespectful to say we complain about 'mundane' things🤷‍♀️  when what we complain about is the fact that we aren't treated equally - given the same representation - have to hide or live in fear - and so much more. Those aren't mundane wants. 

As for you - you clearly don't understand enough about us to make a solid judgement. (We don't expect you to understand the complexity of transgender people. But we expect you to listen to us *as people who it actually affects* and learn before casting your opinions on us)

3458,"This whole fiasco is only so Borisov buys more time. Protests albeit a bit split among their own ideas about the future, have clear demands which are resignation of both the government as well as the Chief's Prosecutor. Unfortunately, socialist party tries to abuse the situation in its own favour which ultimately led to bringing up populists idea such as constitution change. What a big part of protesters fail to acknowledge swiftly is that such a constitution change, as they plan it, is only going to ""entrench"" the corrupt elements in the government even further. What protesters also need is to overcome the socialist party who openly tries to appropriate the protest. It is a difficult situation since only a hard and unrelenting protest can drive off a proven corrupt and criminal power. It is very difficult to preach such behaviour since every other citizen approaches similar opinions with distrust and/or out of fear (which is easily understandable but still very inappropriate given the circumstances). In this part of the world, Bulgaria has always been an ""exchange coin"" between the two regional powers: namely Turkey and Russia. Bulgarian society needs to understand first and foremost that it should indeed follow Vasil Levski's deeds and ideals about ""pure and holy republic"" as he called it: a secular republic which grants its citizens equal rights no matter their religion or ethnicity. That may sound irrelevant given the current situation but such an ideal can only be achieved through ideals such as honesty, dignity and perseverance of those who are in power. Unfortunately, due to past 70-80 years of systematic terror, such abstract ideals are often seen as archaic, outdated and ridiculed. Fear quells any spark of desire for change. It may sound worse than it is, truth is, it isn't any better nevertheless. If Bulgaria does not follow this very path, it is indeed doomed to disappear under the suzerainty of neighbouring countries in the next century or two, be it formal or informal (such as Transnistria or Belarus which are both puppets of Russia, no matter the de jure independence of the latter). It is indeed one of the fastest shrinking countries in Europe (if not in the world), and that is mainly due to emigration.",,/r/europe/comments/ib8ndk/how_bulgaria_has_developed_from_1990_to_2020/g1v57ai/,Mucupka,1597675942

3509,"The Duma in Russia is an even bigger puppet. Parties elected to the Duma are sponsored from the budget (this is a federal law). The second part of party funding is donations from large and medium-sized businesses.

The leader of the largest party, United Russia, is Dmitry Medvedev, who was President of the Russian Federation in 2008-2013 after Putin's 2 terms and returned power to Putin. In fact, it was a circumvention of the 2-term limitation.

Dmitry Medvedev, like most officials in key positions, is Putin's acquaintance from his work in the St. Petersburg administration in the 90s. From 2013 to 2020, he was prime minister.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the United Russia Party occupies 338 out of 450 seats.

Russia is a Federation and the United Russia Party has a majority in regional parliaments.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem for Putin is that United Russia is very unpopular after the 2019 pension reform to raise the retirement age. And this is a big problem because the main support for Putin is pensioners and people of pre-retirement age, who are drinking change after the events of 1991, 1993 and the 1998 financial crisis.

The United Russia party now has very low support - official polls show 31%. When asked how the respondents assess the activities of the ruling party, 39% answered positively, while 45% negatively.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone understands that not a single serious decision in Russia is made without Putin's approval.

3542,"You're completely right. Just it's exactly the LGBT that you're describing not the Polish government though.

There is not a slightest characteristic that it would share with any kind of dictatorship. On the other hand LGBT shares plenty of them because it's nothing else but a hateful, dictatorship-like ideology.

For example, you have a complete freedom of speech in Poland, where the only thing that is not legal or is dangerous for you to say is inciting to violence against someone (in any form, whenever it's physical, economical or social violence). At the same time people on west even have literally their life destroyed by being fired from their work, excluded from society and banned from mainstream social media for the slightest critique of LGBT ideology or individuals from protected by it groups of people, even when it's a legit concern with literally zero hate in it.

LBGT calls itself with their flagship slogan of ""tolerance"" when the only people who they do tolerate are the ones who share their views. Everyone else is to be silenced, banned or destroyed. Pure hate and inciting to violence towards people not agreeing with it is totally ok according to LGBT followers as they believe those people are some kind of subhumans who should not have any rights and their views or voice should not be heard. The most common practice is to label someone not agreeing with you with any kind of label saying it's a ""bad person"" to make others not wanting to hear you or to deal with you at all. The exact same mechanism of what ""jew"" and ""communist"" were used by nazists back then.

Mainstream mass media? Saying anything not even negative, but just not positive about the privileged and protected groups of LGBT ideology is literally suicide of your career.

3595,"Already posted this in the megathread, so I'll just copy &amp; paste it here too.

 Just some personal experience here. I finally got to Belarus yesterday, to my home city of Minsk, my native Shabany district, an infamous cruel proletarian outskirts of the city filled with blocks of multi-story concrete houses. It's a been a while since I visited the country for the last time, and even that last visit was for immigration purposes only, I needed to do some paperwork on the ground. But I just couldn't stay away from the protests anymore, been hating Luka with my gut before it was cool, participated in protests since I was a kid in late 90s. And after all, I still do have my Belarusian citizenship so it still feels like my responsibility to remove the bloody dictator and his pigs.

So yesterday was my first day of protests and the first proper day in the country in a long time. For the initial hours in the streets I was constantly on the brink of tears of excitement. So unusual to see people with white-red-white flags in Shabany, to feel the solidarity that is almost palpable. There must be something in the water.

Me and my parents drove to the Stele, the location of the protest rally. Countless people and cars with the flags greeting each other, honking, cheering, waving hands and flags, sporting the V gesture. All over the fucking city. We parked the car in a couple of kilometers from the Stele and walked to the location. It was damn huge there, hundreds of thousands of people, Belarusians of all sorts: old ladies, workers, urban youngsters, hipsters, hippies, punks, metalheads, paratroopers, priests...

Never in my live I have seen my dad so excited and enthusiastic about anything, mom was happy too. They both were chanting, singing, greeting other protesters non-stop for the several hours that we spent there. We are really lucky with the season, Luka made a mistake holding ""election"" in the summer, it's so much easier and more comfy to protest. It so happened that I participated in Euromaidan too back then, and guess what, August is so much better than February.

[Here are some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/yEUIzll) that I made at Stele. Nothing really special, these won't make front pages but I still would like share for the sake of history and while I'm at it anyway.

If we are talking about the states of the warsaw pact beginning in 1968 and certainly after 1980 up until today propaganda is not meant to convince a majority, that everything is wonderful, it's meant to exert power and dominance, so that people are afraid of being political. Noone believes this shit, even most perpetrators cops and officials believes that everything is wonderful. But they reurgitate it in order to secure their own personal status. 

You are right that pre 1968 things were different. Fascists? They were completely high on their own suppy and drunk their own kool-aid to the bitter end of it. Communism is kind of a different story. If we are talking about communism pre 1920 that's the most radical movement of human liberation short of anarchism, certainly much more radical than liberalism. But they fucked up the revolution like the Jacobinians and then it ended up as the state ideology of one of the most oppressive regimes ever seen. There is a evil genius in stalinism for not abandoning communism but turning it into it's exact opposite. It's analogous to something like gaslighting, when abusers play nice with their victims to make them question their own conscience. Do you know that scene in clockwork orange, where the guy is forced to watch his favorite music of Beethoven to images of   
NSFL violence? This is stalinism. It conditions the people to believe a better world is not possible. Those who believed in communism 1920-1970 they were basically lying to themselves: USSR is this, when really it's that. Their idealism served them poorly and led them to be executed in show trials and rolled over by tanks in prague.

And again Germany is the only big countryin the EU to handle this. They focus on reality instead of supporting Greece in all costs about this East-Med issue.

Considering that Kavkaz 2008 seamlessly led to the Georgian War and the occupation of Crimea was covered as a military exercise in its forst stage, it's not surprising.

3767,"the officer didn't lose their job and stands by the evidence they presented. 

&gt; Following a police decision to treat Charlene's disappearance as murder, there were several arrests in the case, and two men stood trial in May 2007. The prosecution alleged at Preston Crown Court that Charlene had been murdered by Iyad Albattikhi, a 29-year-old man from Jordan and the owner of ""Funny Boyz"" fast-food outlet in Blackpool. Mohammed Reveshi, Albattikhi's business partner, was accused of disposing of her body. According to the prosecution, Albattikhi had sex with Charlene.[21][22] The prosecution alleged that the men had discussed disposing of her body by putting it in kebabs sold from the fast food outlet.[6][23]

&gt;The jury failed to reach a verdict. A re-trial was ordered and scheduled for April 2008, but such serious errors in the Lancashire Constabulary's covert-surveillance evidence were identified that the Crown Prosecution Service could offer no case, and the men were released.[5][17][24] In 2011, Albattikhi was convicted of assault after headbutting an 18-year-old woman.[25]

&gt;After a critical report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, one of the detectives involved, Det Sgt Jan Beasant, was found guilty of misconduct by Lancashire Constabulary and told to resign, but the Police Arbitration Tribunal overturned the decision.[26] In 2014, Beasant's lawyer said she was suing the police for up to £500,000, as her transcripts were in fact entirely accurate.[27]

3953,"A puppet state is a country that is controlled by another one.

The Republic of Cyprus is in no way controlled by Greece.

""TRNC"" depends on Turkey on everything and first and foremost on economy. 

Turkey builds a ton of mosques in thr last years and sent a ton of imams(not sure if that's how they are called) because TCs are not muslim enough.

A big chunk of teachers are Turkish(not TC). This is something the organization of teachers was complaining about.

A big portion(maybe more than half) of people living in the northern part of the island come from Turkey.

Check the latest economic agreement they made with Tatar and tell me if ""TRNC"" is not a puppet state.

Check what Erdogan said to Akinci. He told him to keep his mouth closed because he can cast him down from his position because he is responsible for the existence of that position.
He called the people to answer Akinci appropriately.

Does Erdogan see Akinci as an equal? As a president of another state?

A few weeks ago Tatar, Ozersay and Arikli went in Ankara to meet him. Do you know what they were doing there? He was trying to organise them so they can find a way to cooperate to win the elections in October so Akinci and Erhurman don't win.
Their 'visit' was condemned by the other political parties because Turkey shouldn't intervene in the internal politics of the TC community.

There are 40.000 turkish soldiers there. The police is controlled by the turkish army(Turkey).
There is no Ministry of Justice. 
There is no Ministry of Defense.

In 2000 Mustafa Akinci said that the police should be controlled by the ""Ministry of Internal Affairs"" instead of the turkish army and a chief of the turkish army called him a traitor.

A few years ago a journalist named Sener Levent made a caricature of Erdogan(during Afrin invasion). His paper offices were attacked by a bunch of nationalists. Do you think they got punished? Sener Levent sued Erdogan for it.
Sener also had to go to the court for that caricature. The court decided he was innocent.

A few weeks ago politicians from Turkey came to Cyprus violating the protocols of Coronavirus(since they should be quarantined). The 'Ministers' just let them in.
A week ago a member of the Turkish Parliament came with his wife violating the protocols for coronavirus. The 'Ministers' let them come in without negative PCR.

When political parties have in their agenda that they want to make the relationship with Turkey a relationship of equals instead of total dependence, then yes, they are puppet state.",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/iaw80f/borrell_calls_on_turkey_to_immediately_stop/g1t5ffi/,Bran37,1597641878

What I hated about ""the Imitation Game"" was that it didn't do justice to Rejewski (also the misrepresented Turing as being difficult to work with; in real life he was eccentric but still a good collaborator). 

Rejewski literally was the first. He and his team did the first major breakthrough of realizing (which was innovative at the time) that the Enigma couldn't be cracked linguistically, it had to be done mathematically, and started building models for how that was done. When they started working on it at Bletchley Park, the Enigma had already been cracked and Turing started his work from a comprehensive decoded cipher book, example decoded messages and *a functional code-breaking machine* named The Cryptologic Bomb (from Polish ""Bomba Cryptologiczna""). 

The major contribution of Turing et al in this case was they managed to finish what Rejewski couldn't; after the Germans realized the Enigma was cracked, they improved it, and even if it still functioned on the same principles, the Poles didn't have the resources to build strong enough machines. 

Turing was a true genius that made undying  contributions to human knowledge, but ""crack the Enigma"" he did not.

Hmm.

I'm gonna search for ""map"" on the sub and look at the last ten images of Europe and see what percentage it shows up in.

1. [Age dependency ratio in Europe in 2019](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/i9ilso/age_dependency_ratio_in_europe_in_2019_map/): Present, but only looks like a flyspeck.  I assume that it doesn't participate in Eurostat, so given that it's a small landmass and there are white outlines and gray land, it's just hard to see.

2. [Anime Set Outside of Japan: A Map of 70 Anime](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/i7skwn/anime_set_outside_of_japan_a_map_of_70_anime/): Present.

3. [Map of European languages spoken around the world](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/i5uyye/oc_map_of_european_languages_spoken_around_the/): Not present.  This map appears to be a clickable one, and I suspect that a lot of small landmasses are removed.  The outlines of coasts are certainly simplified.

4. [I made a map displaying how united our countries are, by the number of major organisations they are in. Kind of beautiful to see them gradually hooking together.](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/i420k0/v2_i_made_a_map_displaying_how_united_our/) Present (though looks to be colored as part of Denmark, which probably is not correct for what the image is trying to show).

5. [Map of the common colours of European postboxes I made myself after doing some research](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/i2w168/map_of_the_common_colours_of_european_postboxes_i/): Present.

6. [Map of new cases of Covid-19 last week vs the week before that](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/hzeaeu/map_of_new_cases_of_covid19_last_week_vs_the_week/).  Not visible.  Iceland looks to be covering it up in an inset.

7. [Corona map of Europe, according to Hungary. The Bay of Biscay seems particularly heavily hit.](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/hwent9/corona_map_of_europe_according_to_hungary_the_bay/): Legend covers up much of Scotland and probably all other islands up that way.

8. [1929 National Geographic map of Europe and the Near East](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/hus31z/1929_national_geographic_map_of_europe_and_the/): Present (as one would expect from *National Geographic*).

9. [A map of EU members’ largest trading partners in 2018](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/hur4zl/a_map_of_eu_members_largest_trading_partners_in/): Not present; may be covered by a legend.  However, this is not unreasonable, as the map only aimed to display EU members.

10. [Map of European Countries and their Brother Countries](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/htujbc/map_of_european_countries_and_their_brother/): Present (and explicitly has arrows and an entry in the legend)

So of that, 6 maps have the Faroe Islands.  Admittedly, one of those probably is using the wrong color for it, but one also goes out of its way to add reference to it.

The remaining 4 maps do not.  One doesn't have it, but it's probably because it explicitly simplified country outlines and omitted many small islands around the world; that's probably not unreasonable given the goal of being a clickable map.  One obscures or clips it out, but also only aimed to show EU members, so it seems understandable.  The remaining two either clip it out of the map or place a legend over the top.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ib32vq/how_come_that_so_many_ppl_forget_to_add_my/g1sjx3x/,duisThias,1597627236

3. Peculiarity: In its values kind of the opposite of German stereotypes: chaotic, anarchist, shabby, dirty, alternative (if you're into this type of city).

4. Monumental: At least the city centre with the Brandenburg Gate, the museum island, etc.

4374,"See? We mostly agree on all stuff.

&gt; In internet always, when is Poland mentioned there is Czech which remind affair with salt or other meat.

First, it wasn't just one affair, but multiple affairs. Secondly, its usually our way to put Polish people down when they get into their ""Polish food greatest, bettest"". I don't know and haven noticed anyone who would come with it in the first place. It usually serves as a reaction. But maybe we visit different internet circles?

&gt; Look I have similar attitude for such guys, that's why I always hate those idiots with Winged Hussars in avatars saying that PoLaND sAvEd WOrLd!!111!, Nope, Poland saved themselves.

This is stuff that irks me. When Polish people mention battle of Vienna, it is often as ""Poland saved Europe against Islam!"" *happy Winged Hussar noises**.

Then you read about the battle. Polish army formed only part of a single column (out of 3 total) of a greater Christian army that came as a relief force to Vienna. Hussars didn't charge immediately, but only after several hours of (mostly german) infantry fighting wore down the Turks and created an opportunity for a charge. (Infantry started to fight at 4am, Hussars didn't charge until 4pm)

&gt; Thing is, in that moment there was no international tribunal dedicated to this region. There was only agreement between local governments (both sides!) about temporary division of Cieszyn county based on entnicity of citizens. Your gevernment just didn't recognize this agreement (or said that in the moment of aggresion) and attacked when Poland was engaged in couple of different conflicts and have almost no army here. When Czechs took over everything what wanted, Allies enter to chat, and offical international negotations started. I wouldn't say that situation was ""little more complex"". Being on Czechs position, I would do the same, but please don't say that we started this. You just bail on agreement, when it was beneficial for you. Such a courage. Of course if you have other sources, please share it. 

The territory was divided by Allies (mostly Britain, France and USA). With France often serving as a self-imposed arbiter. Czechoslovakia thought that it had a better political chance of getting the territory given the historical claims and political connections, so they were happy to wait. Only after the plebiscite and recruitment of troops did the Czech side decided to act, because otherwise, Poland could claim a territorial rights based on this. After all, situation is not much different if someone starts to use your land and after 20 years, they would get the land based on its usage.

&gt; Yes, I know about Sudeten Germans, I know about Munich and this looser Chamberlain waving documents and saying that he saved peace in Europe. I know difficult situation was for you. Still, you didn't do anything, there was not a single shoot. Then after real german aggresion couple months later, you collaborated with Adolf as Protectorate (yes I know that majority of Czechs were in oppositon to this fact but still, Czechs were in government). 

There were few shots, but Czechia was under a strong political pressure to not defend themselves. Surrounded by enemies. I can disagree with the final decision, it was not bravest, but it wasn't stupid.

I could equally claim that Poland boasted itself as having stronger military then Nazi and being able to drive Nazi all the way back to Berlin (after all, Pilsudski government had quite close to Fascism, being military dictatorship). We both know what then happened.

&gt; Only way how I could image, Poland could survive German aggresion, is alliance with Czechoslovakia. And Czechoslovakia could survive thanks to this alliance either. You could be tough opponent for German considering numbers. Good defence lines, good industry, strong army. Hitler had to attack you first, we could help you with logistic, maybe with army. Still odds for pushing away Hitler would be small, but bigger than in all others simualtions. Unfortunatelly our government was to blind to see this (yours too). 

Yes. More importantly, a united political front would serve as a better deterrent against Chamberlain's ideas (oh, how I hate the modern portrayal of Chamberlain as a ""calculated attempt to buy time). WW2 might have never happened.

&gt; Look, be honest. USSR helped nations of Middle and Eastern Europe 7 years later and were forced to ""receiving aid"" through next 45 years. Poland-USSR border was still hot between 20-39. Till 38 conflict with Soviets was only real danger for our army, govenrment and society. I doubt that, USSR honestly wanted help you and it was to dangerous for us. That's all.

USSR wanted to help us because we were the only nation in the Central Europe that didn't behave hostile towards it based on ideological reasons. Britain, France and USA viewed USSR as a huge danger due to internal pressure from communist parties. After all, they wanted to put Hitler against USSR, which is the reason why Munich wasn't rejected and how Hitler wasn't immediately politically isolated. Czechoslovakia thus served as an important political bridge and an ""inside man"" from the Soviet perspective.

Those 200k+ we see in the videos are those that are both brave and hopeful at the same time. That's a small minority subset of those who wants change or voted opposition.  


What one could do is to compare demonstration numbers to other demonstration numbers, but then you should take into account population density, fear of persecution, and how violent the demonstrations could become. In the end, even that is a pretty useless exercise.

4377,"&gt; but more like another part of the prolonged Polish-Soviet conflict 

True.  
   
&gt;that was started by the Soviets.  
   
No. Where do you get that idea from?  
   
&gt;So you mean that Poland 'invaded' Russia by mere existence, right? Because Warsaw was also a Russian Empire's city.  
    
Not Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Later, Lithuania and Czechoslovakia. I don't think there's a single neighboring country Poland didn't attempt to invade or take territory from in the interwar period. Not for existing, but for believing Poland has some sort of weird right to rule entire Eastern Europe. And Soviets reaching Warsaw in a counteroffensive to the Polish invasion does not make Poland the victim. I'm not praising Russia, I'm stating how weird this conflict is being portrayed here. It's like people get off on imagining Poland as a poor weak kid that everyone bullies, when it was one of the most aggressive and expansionist European countries of the period.   
   
&gt;And why did Soviet Russia have better claims to these regions than Poland?    
    
Did I say that?   
   
&gt;And what did Russia do in Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania? How did they acquire these lands?  
   
Does it matter? We're talking about whitewashing Polish history, and I don't see how ""but Russians did it too"" is a valid defense. Yet, the westward offensive of the Red Army was almost completely bloodless until Poland attacked the Red Army and Ukraine. And, while for the most part Russia's/Soviet involvement in these countries was composed of supporting factions of already ongoing civil wars, which already had at least some legitimacy with the local populations, Poland was determined on outright invasions.",Bosnia and Herzegovina,/r/europe/comments/iamffh/in_1920_poland_defeated_the_soviets_despite_their/g1rsntj/,neko_ceko,1597611550

Except making shit up about how these soldiers could participate in the crackdown. All nine of them that came for an annual competition. 

&gt;one of the most informative voices available for western audiences.

Dear God, poor audience. 

Do you honestly want to be misinformed? I understand being against Lukashenko, but why the fuck would you want this dude to make shit up about some soldiers that came over for a friendly competition? 

&gt;Everything about your character in this website is fake. 

What exactly is fake? I'm very open about my stances and experiences.

&gt; get giddy at the thought of Serbia being then able to enact the Final Solution on Kosovars.

You're now outright lying. You are unable to address the fact that he lied, so now you're attacking me personally with more lies. 

&gt;On other threads you become a bleeding heart liberal insisting that Europe must let anyone showing up at its border in.

I'm insisting that some European countries fulfill their obligations under the international law. We all agreed to that.

I don't want migrants to come to my country either, but I fully support treating any asylum seeker as defined by the international law. There was a time when people from these parts also had to ran away and look for help in foreign countries, and I sympathize with that. 

Not pushing people out to sea is really a low bar for being a liberal, or a human.

&gt;That might seem like comments from two different personalities, but it is far more simpler. You believe the first and don't believe the second - that one you say without believing as you think voices like that might bring forth the downfall of the West and make your Final Solution possible.

Bolsheviks renounced all claims to this land in Brest-Litvost treaty and after they declared that partitions of PLC were illegal and thus invalid.

4470,"&gt; Moment wasn't random, you knew that Poland fought of 4 other frontiers and it was only your chance to move. You knew also that miliatry action will summon Allied interest, so you had to move pretty fast to have better position in negotations.

This is baseless speculation lol. Do i need to point out that there were multiple warnings given to Poland to cease the activities? 

&gt;I heard some dumb argument from you about ""international comission"" and that we broke treatment by gathering soldiers. This commision was formed after your aggresion. Something more? Do you know facts, which I am not concious? Share it. 

The whole thing about it being disputed territory is that the nations shouldn't interact with it in a way that would suggest that the territory is in fact theirs, hence the agreement. 

When you hold elections there and enlist people to military you are doing the exact opposite.

&gt;I'am happy that you're happy. And on Czechoslovakia ruins, Protectorate was created, with Czechs in power. I don't need to say what Protectorate did. (I don't want to talk about Slovakia, because it's just more deeep shiiit). Of course you'll say that ""no no, it was ruled by Germans"". It's true, but somehow whole government was created by Czechs. 

Yes, that was the whole idea of it..The idea of the Munich agreement was - Give Germans the sudettes and that's it..No war..Sounds like a good scenario no?

Well, when the Germans gave the ultimatum...Give up or we'll fucking rek you.. At that point there are NO ARGUMENTS to be made, that chosing not to go to war with Germany was a bad call..

If the pre-Munich best case scenario before Germany taking Austria was 3 weeks at best, with continuous retreat to tatra mountains..
Then Czechoslovakia without its fortifications and the mountains surrounding it, the war would be over instantly.

I still don't understand why you keep arguing against this. The population difference is enough to tell the story. The Reich had 69 million people, Czechoslovakia had 13 and 23-24% of it were Germans.

Germany had more professional soldiers than Czechoslovakia after full-mobilization.

&gt;Of course you'll say that ""no no, it was ruled by Germans"". It's true, but somehow whole government was created by Czechs. 

It was ruled by Germans, I literally told you in the comment above. Yes it had Czechs in it and absolutely nothing was to be done, without the ""Yes"" of a ""Reich protektor"". The Czech constitution was broken many times, Czech laws were ignored.  And several months later the Protectorate lost its ""autonomus"" status and was ruled by Germans.

**THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT** Keep CZECHs in, make it seem like everyone is fucking happy, because you are autonomous and ""under protection"". So the allies can't say they broke the Munich agreement. 

You know what the reaction to this was?

They pulled their ambassadors in protest. Chemberlain even tried to argue that because Czechoslovakia ceased to exist, theres no need to uphold the promises made regarding the Munich agreement.

Spineless.

&gt;Yeah and after this fact I hear that you guys often blame Poland for 68.

Nobody blames Poland for 68 lol what the fuck are you on about. Yes some countries didnt participate in the invasion, but whenever 68 is brought up its about the Soviets.

I  fail to understand why Europeans hate Trump. Too used to reading the  media of our American overlords who determine our foreign policies? Heh.

Trump  has been the most amazing President for our European interests in  forever. He has been weakening America geopolitically and creating a  vacuum of power worldwide as a result. The EU is filling it in this part  of the world. And they are hopefully discussing stopping to rely on  American military and building their own as an Union.

Aside  from that, internally, Trump is actually great compared to his  opposition, who wants to sell the country to Maoists. I understand why  one might not be uptodate, the mainstream American media which is where  everyone gets their info from, is pure propaganda at this point when it  comes to this topic.

Here, have some actual information about what's going on in America right now:

It has to do with supply chains, labour markets, demand and credit valuation. Adding these economies brings demand for goods and services as well as a whole new market for credit. 

The EU could literally dump hundreds of billions in to these two countries over a period of several years and everyone would still come out on top. 

Just imagine how much value would be instantly created in Ukraine and Belarus if their judicial systems were brought in under the EU judiciary! European banks would be lining up to dump credit in to Ukraine and Belarus so the people of those countries could invest in land, infrastructure, housing. 

I mean just in Ukraine we are talking tens of billions of Euros just by allowing Ukrainian citizens to purchase Ukrainian arable land with credit issued by banks who fall under EU judiciary. 

The value of that land instantly jumps if Ukrainians are able to settle financial issues in courts and able to kick court cases all the way up to EU courts. This reduces risk and is like printing gold over night.

I wonder why.

There is no way that adding another construction speciality to the budget of a building doesn't make it more expensive. Sure, people could build their houses a little smaller and use the money they saved from it to add an ornamented portico or a neo classical collumnade instead. But, unsurprisingly, very few people choose to do it, hence why you barely see any baroque, beux-arts or neoclassical buildings being built nowadays.

4715,"&gt;I don't know where you got that because of the economic situation in Turkey right now ready to talk.

Because turkey hasn't been not moving on the issue and the last years escalting the situation, but was not ready to talk. Most media I read point it out, that the turkish economy is on the ground and needs the EU.


&gt;You have something twisted. Greece wanted to go to an international court for this matter. The reason it didn't is that Turkey was asking to put Aegean and any other issue Greece and Turkey have together. This is no possible since its case is different and in some, there is no reason to go court since its only Turkey disputing the treaty of Lausanne.

Greece wanted to go in which matter to the international court? The kastellorizo issue, would only backfire on Greece current claims. All other dispute are not even an issue, as Greek and Cyprus have the law clearly backing them.


&gt;The same situation is right here. "" Blue homeland "" is what they are promoting in order to get as much as they can. It is a situation of ""mine is mine and yours is ours"" How can someone have meaningful negotiations on this basis?

Blue homeland is just bullshit and for me it's seems that's action is more based on strong nationalism on the current government and more for internal posturing.


&gt;Secondary, if a compromise is made the political parties that agree to it they will never see the light of day ever again(both countries). It is not like agreeing with a friendly nation like in the case of Bornholm. Turkey right now is mixed in 3 different countries(Libya, Syria, Iraq) with its army and occupying ground they have been violating Cyprus and now Greece territorial waters and EU barely send a strong-worded letter.

The issue nearly no country has good relation with Turkey. All had their turning points the last years. While Sanctions are weak, most of the payment we made to turkey were all drawn back and cooperation is close to zero. And no country was against more sanction in the last round, the only issue was declaration(which is mostly the strong worded letter).

Cyprus is a clear matter. And Turkey has been a bad actor there. The issue with Greece is a dispute. Turkey has rights there even after international law. The Turkey surveying ship(not those in cyprus waters) is mostly in disputed waters, those are neither Greek or Turkish until the dispute is settled. So Turkey is doing something highly illegal, but not because it's in Greek water. Until the status is not clear nothing can really be done legally there.

Poland and Denmark also needed sometime to agree on the Borholm EEZ. You don't need tension, like the Greek, Turkish ones to take your time to settle that dispute. 


&gt;This is what I am blaming Germany about. Not because they act on their own interest. That's expected by every single country. But pretending to be the leader of the EU.

Germany has two interest there stability/solving conflicts peacefully and a working EU. German foreign policy is of talking and agreements. That's nothing new. And Germany doesn't want to be the leader, mulitlaterism is the big word of German foreign policy. Especially under Merkel quick and deceivise action aren't the things in German politics.


&gt;The leading country of the EU needs way different qualities and policies than what Germany is bringing on the table.

EU is quite democratic and there is no leader and if at all we have a leader for a position or an Issues.


&gt;It has to act not only in its own interest but in the interest of all. If Germany was actually trying to solve the issue sanctions would be in the place that would force Turkey to compromise. Instead, they expect Greece to fall back.

Turkey was ready to talk about the issue(Greece-Turkey EEZ). That could have been on the way of solving. The Greek Egyptian deel could have waited afterwards. It was made exactly before the talks started. A month later would have been a different issue. And Germany is not against sanction, especially not in the Cyprus issue, but putting the Greek-Egypt deal in the declaration for the Cyprus issue is just next level Greek nationalism, in my opinion.  


&gt;As for the Greece-Egypt deal, it doesn't even have kastelorizo area inside! It's only Create and half of Rhodes or are you telling me that those don't deserve EEZ as well? Because that is exactly what Turkey is claiming


First of all, all inhabited island deserve an EEZ, that law. Second if there are issue, there are two ways to solve them. Treaty between the countries or going to one of the internatioanl courts.

The issue is that island have they have less influence against continental land mass. That is in Article 7 and was ruled in cased against the court often like that. How much is not specified. Rhodos would fall into in a far lesser extent and could mean that maybe a small percentage could go to turkey or nothing, but that would be only seen if the complete EEZ would have been solved between the countries. Either due treaty or Court, until then Agreements are always difficult.
As the law is so unpreciese and the EEZ agreement can look like they want. 
So it's doesn't need to follow natural boundary completly. That's the issue. If the law state it would need to follow natural boundaries and how the percentage are split that deal with Greece and Egypt would be completly legitimate. But it doesn't.

A reason Greece won't go to court. Especially since the complete EEZ there would be ruled and could swing either way. The law is unprecise that pretty much up to the judge. On the other hand Turkey won't go to court as they would accept UNCLOS. That would mean EEZ claims in Cyprus illegal and blue homeland anyway(when Turkey announced it I though it was satire as the lybia deal until I remembered who governs turkey). Also it could swing also against Turkey, while the result would be far better, than the maximum Greek claims, it would be less than Turkey would hope for.

How did anyone get this strange idea?

*Die Grünen* is IMO the very last party Erdoğan would want rising in
political significance in the German Bundestag. They're pro-NATO,
broadly anti-Erdoğan, especially their leadership and top politicians. Here's an excerpt from a Green Party statement on NATO's 70th anniversary:

&gt; [**Europe needs
&gt; NATO**](https://www.gruene-bundestag.de/themen/internationale-politik/70-jahre-nato)  
&gt; From the point of view of the Green Party in the Bundestag, NATO must
&gt; become more political. It must not stand idly by when one of its
&gt; members wages wars contrary to international law and invades other
&gt; countries – as Turkey does in Syria. By remaining silent on this
&gt; issue, NATO, as the sum of its members, is denying its own
&gt; understanding of itself as an alliance of values that stands for an
&gt; order based on international law. More than ever, NATO must credibly
&gt; stand up for values such as freedom, democracy and human rights, for
&gt; an order based on international law. This applies to its external
&gt; actions, but above all to its internal actions. The European members
&gt; in particular cannot afford to abandon the long-term goal of a
&gt; Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security area.

4813,"well, its not irreasonable, gernamy has a lot of profit from turkey through its investments and also a large turkish minority in germany. long story short, we ask from eu members to lose money on our behalf. do we 'play by the rules' and are we a eu member, while turkey is being aggressive and out of eu? sure, but they would be more willing to actively support us if there was an alternative for them.

germany also needs to have positive relationships with everyone. so even sanctions targetting turkish companies with ties to erdogan, not turkey as a whole, is not really an option either.

greece knows that eu wont easily take active measures. my guess is that we will actively block many of eu decisions until eu is forced to take minor sanctions when / if usa decides to take some action too, and the eu becomes even more disfunctional with greece, cyprus and france giving many obstacles. but thats all greece can achieve imo. 

note that while turkey not long ago disregarded eu to every aspect, turkey now tries to create ties with some eu members to stop greece's actions, and it has so far achieved that.

so all greece does is to gain time, keep the diplomatic and action initiative, and silently push for others to our terms. but eu wont ever be able to give a solution, so turkey targeting its actions towards eu does not mean much for turkey.

its intresting to see how macron and trump will act now that they seem to have some kind of 'agreements' over east med. these two countries can do way more to turkey that whatever eu can.

also, greece hols a wild card in its hands: germany and especially turkey need to have deeper customs union. talks about that matter within eu will come to place within late 2020 or q1-q2 2021... greece CAN and WILL block any deepening of eu turkey ties, not to mantion we might be able to threaten about older decisions about customs union between the two.

unfortunately for turkey, no matter how much it can promise to some eu members, it wont be able to directly affect eu decisions, as greece can.

what makes me wonder though, is that greece has proved to be quite flexible to its demands, only wanting the islands to actually 'exist' according to unclos, even if they dont get 100% of what they can get, as egypt - greece deal proves. while turkey on the other hand wants the islands to be... well, kinda not there. so i wonder why germany insists on turkey rhetoric about deals between greece and turkey, in order for the matter to be resovled, as they say, since current situation will only lead to further tensions. all greece wants actually is for turkey to recognise islands exist and we can talk about anything regarding them. i am 100% positive that a similar deal with egypt can be achieved with turkey, but i really believe that its crucial for turkey the islands to have no value, so much crucial that it wont ever accept anything less than that.",,/r/europe/comments/iahd7u/eu_reaffirms_full_solidarity_with_greece_and/g1q46du/,cupid91,1597574827

Easily crushed? The Bavarian uprising lasted a month, and the Spartacist uprising lasted a week in the capital of Weimar republic. Both had to be suppressed using paramilitary organization because the proper army was not capable of doing so. Now think of what would happen if instead of some insurgents it was hundreds of thousands of Bolsheviks.

&gt;Are you going to throw the 20 million number? Or maybe 40 million? 100  million? Modern estimates range from 6 to 10 million deliberate victims. 

1.6 million deaths in Gulags, 5.7 million in Holodomor, 800k in Judical executions, 400k in dekulakization, and that's only recorded victims.

&gt;Considering that 26 million people died as a result of Barbarossa, and 11 million in the Holocaust 

Tremendous mental gymnastics of you to blame 26 millions of deaths from Barbarossa on Hitler, and entirely ignoring Stalin deliberately sending his soldiers to death with NKVD legions behind them to shoot any people who tried to flee.

Taking Hard Line, Greece Turns Back Migrants by Abandoning Them at Sea

Many Greeks have grown frustrated as tens of thousands of asylum seekers languished on Greek islands. Now, evidence shows, a new conservative government has a new method of keeping them out.

RHODES, Greece — The Greek government has secretly expelled more than 1,000 refugees from Europe’s borders in recent months, sailing many of them to the edge of Greek territorial waters and then abandoning them in inflatable and sometimes overburdened life rafts.

Since March, at least 1,072 asylum seekers have been dropped at sea by Greek officials in at least 31 separate expulsions, according to an analysis of evidence by The New York Times from three independent watchdogs, two academic researchers and the Turkish Coast Guard. The Times interviewed survivors from five of those episodes and reviewed photographic or video evidence from all 31.

“It was very inhumane,” said Najma al-Khatib, a 50-year-old Syrian teacher, who says masked Greek officials took her and 22 others, including two babies, under cover of darkness from a detention center on the island of Rhodes on July 26 and abandoned them in a rudderless, motorless life raft before they were rescued by the Turkish Coast Guard.

“I left Syria for fear of bombing — but when this happened, I wished I’d died under a bomb,” she told The Times.

Illegal under international law, the expulsions are the most direct and sustained attempt by a European country to block maritime migration using its own forces since the height of the migration crisis in 2015, when Greece was the main thoroughfare for migrants and refugees seeking to enter Europe.

The Greek government denied any illegality.

“Greek authorities do not engage in clandestine activities,’’ said a government spokesman, Stelios Petsas. “Greece has a proven track record when it comes to observing international law, conventions and protocols. This includes the treatment of refugees and migrants.”

Since 2015, European countries like Greece and Italy have mainly relied on proxies, like the Turkish and Libyan governments, to head off maritime migration. What is different now is that the Greek government is increasingly taking matters into its own hands, watchdog groups and researchers say.

For example, migrants have been forced onto sometimes leaky life rafts and left to drift at the border between Turkish and Greek waters, while others have been left to drift in their own boats after Greek officials disabled their engines. “These pushbacks are totally illegal in all their aspects, in international law and in European law,” said Prof. François Crépeau, an expert on international law and a former United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants.

“It is a human rights and humanitarian disaster,” Professor Crépeau added.

Greeks were once far more understanding of the plight of migrants. But many have grown frustrated and hostile after a half-decade in which other European countries offered Greece only modest assistance as tens of thousands of asylum seekers languished in squalid camps on overburdened Greek islands.

Since the election last year of a new conservative government under Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greece has taken a far harder line against the migrants — often refugees from the war in Syria — who push off Turkish shores for Europe.

The harsher approach comes as tensions have mounted with Turkey, itself burdened with 3.6 million refugees from the Syrian war, far more than any other nation.

Greece believes that Turkey has tried to weaponize the migrants to increase pressure on Europe for aid and assistance in the Syrian War. But it has also added pressure on Greece at a time when the two nations and others spar over contested gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean.

For several days in late February and early March, the Turkish authorities openly bused thousands of migrants to the Greek land border in a bid to set off a confrontation, leading to the shooting of at least one Syrian refugee and the immediate extrajudicial expulsions of hundreds of migrants who made it to Greek territory.

For years, Greek officials have been accused of intercepting and expelling migrants, on a sporadic and infrequent basis, usually before the migrants manage to land their boats on Greek soil.

But experts say Greece’s behavior during the pandemic has been far more systematic and coordinated. Hundreds of migrants have been denied the right to seek asylum even after they have landed on Greek soil, and they’ve been forbidden to appeal their expulsion through the legal system.

“They’ve seized the moment,” Professor Crépeau said of the Greeks. “The coronavirus has provided a window of opportunity to close national borders to whoever they’ve wanted.”

Emboldened by the lack of sustained criticism from the European Union, where the migration issue has roiled politics, Greece has hardened its approach in the eastern Mediterranean in recent months.

Migrants landing on the Greek islands from Turkey have frequently been forced onto sometimes leaky, inflatable life rafts, dropped at the boundary between Turkish and Greek waters, and left to drift until being spotted and rescued by the Turkish Coast Guard.

“This practice is totally unprecedented in Greece,” said Niamh Keady-Tabbal, a doctoral researcher at the Irish Center for Human Rights, and one of the first to document the phenomenon.

“Greek authorities are now weaponizing rescue equipment to illegally expel asylum seekers in a new, violent and highly visible pattern of pushbacks spanning several Aegean Islands,” Ms. Keady-Tabbal said. Ms. al-Khatib, who recounted her ordeal for The Times, said she entered Turkey last November with her two sons, 14 and 12, fleeing the advance of the Syrian Army. Her husband, who had entered several weeks earlier, soon died of cancer, Ms. al-Khatib said.

With few prospects in Turkey, the family tried to reach Greece by boat three times this summer, failing once in May because their smuggler did not show up, and a second time in June after being intercepted in Greek waters and towed back to the Turkish sea border, she said.

On their third attempt, on July 23 at around 7 a.m., they landed on the Greek island of Rhodes, Ms. al-Khatib said, an account corroborated by four other passengers interviewed by The Times. They were detained by Greek police officers and taken to a small makeshift detention facility after handing over their identification documents.

Using footage filmed at this site by two passengers, a Times reporter was able to identify the facility’s location beside the island’s main ferry port and visit the camp.

A Coast Guard officer and an official at the island’s mayoralty both said the site falls under the jurisdiction of the Port Police, an arm of the Hellenic Coast Guard.

A Palestinian refugee, living in a disused slaughterhouse beside the camp, confirmed that Ms. al-Khatib had been there, recounting how he had spoken to her through the camp’s fence and bought her tablets to treat her hypertension, which Greek officials had refused to supply her. On the evening of July 26, Ms. al-Khatib and the other detainees said that police officers had loaded them onto a bus, telling them they were being taken to a camp on another island, and then to Athens.

Instead, masked Greek officials transferred them to two vessels that ferried them out to sea before dropping them on rafts at the Turkish maritime border, she and other survivors said.

Amid choppy waves, the group, which included two babies, was forced to drain the raft using their hands as water slopped over the side, they said.

The group was rescued at 4:30 a.m. by the Turkish Coast Guard, according to a report by the Coast Guard that included a photograph of Ms. al-Khatib as she left the life raft.

Ms. al-Khatib tried to reach Greece for a fourth time, on Aug. 6, but said her boat was stopped off the island of Lesbos by Greek officials, who removed its fuel and towed it back to Turkish waters.

Some groups of migrants have been transferred to the life rafts even before landing on Greek soil.",,/r/europe/comments/iap48q/taking_hard_line_greece_turns_back_migrants_by/g1pxw8g/,anonimraptor,1597568007

4931,"On May 13, Amjad Naim, a 24-year-old Palestinian law student, was among a group of 30 migrants intercepted by Greek officials as they approached the shores of Samos, a Greek island close to Turkey. The migrants were quickly transferred to two small life rafts that began to deflate under the weight of so many people, Mr. Naim said. Transferred to two other rafts, they were then towed back toward Turkey.

Videos captured by Mr. Naim on his phone show the two rafts being tugged across the sea by a large white vessel. Footage subsequently published by the Turkish Coast Guard shows the same two rafts being rescued by Turkish officials later in the day.

Migrants have also been left to drift in the boats they arrived on, after Greek officials disabled their engines, survivors and researchers say. And on at least two occasions, migrants have been abandoned on Ciplak, an uninhabited island within Turkish waters, instead of being placed on life rafts.

“Eventually the Turkish Coast Guard came to fetch us,” said one Palestinian survivor who was among a group abandoned on Ciplak in early July, and who sent videos of their time on the island. A report from the Turkish Coast Guard corroborated his account.

In parallel, several rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, have documented how the Greek authorities have rounded up migrants living legally in Greece and secretly expelled them without legal recourse across the Evros River, which divides mainland Greece from Turkey.

Feras Fattouh, a 30-year-old Syrian X-ray technician, said he was arrested by the Greek police on July 24 in Igoumenitsa, a port in western Greece. Mr. Fattouh had been living legally in Greece since November 2019 with his wife and son, and showed The Times documents to prove it.

But after being detained by the police in Igoumenitsa, Mr. Fattouh said, he was robbed and driven about 400 miles east to the Turkish border, before being secretly put on a dinghy with 18 others and sent across the river to Turkey. His wife and son remain in Greece.

“Syrians are suffering in Turkey,” Mr. Fattouh said. “We’re suffering in Greece. Where are we supposed to go?”

Ylva Johansson, who oversees migration policy at the European Commission, the civil service for the European Union, said she was concerned by the accusations but had no power to investigate them.

“We cannot protect our European border by violating European values and by breaching people’s rights,” Ms. Johansson said in an email. “Border control can and must go hand in hand with respect for fundamental rights.”

4960,"I don't know where you got that because of the economic situation in Turkey right now ready to talk.

You have something twisted. Greece wanted to go to an international court for this matter. The reason it didn't is that Turkey was asking to put Aegean and any other issue Greece and Turkey have together. This is no possible since its case is different and in some, there is no reason to go court since its only Turkey disputing the treaty of Lausanne.

The same situation is right here. "" Blue homeland "" is what they are promoting in order to get as much as they can. It is a situation of ""mine is mine and yours is ours"" How can someone have meaningful negotiations on this basis?

Secondary, if a compromise is made the political parties that agree to it they will never see the light of day ever again(both countries). It is not like agreeing with a friendly nation like in the case of Bornholm. Turkey right now is mixed in 3 different countries(Libya, Syria, Iraq) with its army and occupying ground they have been violating Cyprus and now Greece territorial waters and EU barely send a strong-worded letter.

This is what I am blaming Germany about. Not because they act on their own interest. That's expected by every single country. But pretending to be the leader of the EU. The leading country of the EU needs way different qualities and policies than what Germany is bringing on the table. It has to act not only in its own interest but in the interest of all. If Germany was actually trying to solve the issue sanctions would be in the place that would force Turkey to compromise. Instead, they expect Greece to fall back.

As for the Greece-Egypt deal, it doesn't even have kastelorizo area inside! It's only Create and half of Rhodes or are you telling me that those don't deserve EEZ as well? Because that is exactly what Turkey is claiming

5091,"The Battle of Warsaw, also known as the Miracle of the Vistula, was a series of battles that resulted in a decisive Polish victory in 1920 during the Polish–Soviet War. Poland, on the verge of total defeat, repulsed and defeated the Red Army in what Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, called ""an enormous defeat"" for his forces.

After the Polish Kiev Offensive, Soviet forces launched a successful counterattack in summer 1920, forcing the Polish army to retreat westward in disarray. The Polish forces seemed on the verge of disintegration and observers predicted a decisive Soviet victory.

The battle of Warsaw was fought from August 12–25, 1920 as Red Army forces commanded by Mikhail Tukhachevsky approached the Polish capital of Warsaw and the nearby Modlin Fortress. On August 16, Polish forces commanded by Józef Piłsudski counterattacked from the south, disrupting the enemy's offensive, forcing the Russian forces into a disorganized withdrawal eastward and behind the Neman River. Estimated Russian losses were 10,000 killed, 500 missing, 30,000 wounded, and 66,000 taken prisoner, compared with Polish losses of some 4,500 killed, 10,000 missing, and 22,000 wounded.

In the following months, several more Polish follow-up victories secured Poland's independence and led to a peace treaty with Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine later that year, securing the Polish state's eastern frontiers until 1939.

The politician and diplomat Edgar Vincent regards this event as one of the most important battles in history on his expanded list of most decisive battles, since the Polish victory over the Soviets halted the spread of communism further westwards into Europe. A Soviet victory, which would have led to the creation of a pro-Soviet Communist Poland, would have put the Soviets directly on the eastern border of Germany, where considerable revolutionary ferment was present at the time.

After the Battle of Warsaw, the history of Eastern and Western Europe took very different courses. The West has for twenty years enjoyed relative peace, while the East became a bastion of tyranny.

Nobody can hold back currency. The point of currency is for it to continually flow. Also setting 'corporate tax' is not how industry spreads across the Eurozone... It has to be mobile. Even the USA does not have a set corporate tax rate from state to state. (Apple and Ireland vs EU commission legal case).

Europe is flawed. And Germany has not only set the system but exploited it. Defending this is rather ridiculous at this point.
It is what it is. Proclaim defiantly 'we got ya'... And that your life is likely better for it. But to pretend Germany is innocent of not exploiting a broken system and doing severe damage to Europe, is just you either lying through your teeth.. Or just being completely naive.

Even Brexit was never supposed to happen. What people dont know, that the original issue with the UK under Cameron was to STAY.. But rather gain support, to challenge the way the system was set up. Eventually they voted leave instead of giving him powers.

5117,"It means you haven't had the same oligarch feuds fracturing the economy. 

Because ownership etc is pretty straight forward it makes support for business more straight forward and you have less of a risk associated with credit seeking activity or foreign direct investment. 

In Ukraine they are still in the process of untying several sectors of the economy from rent seeking schemes implemented in the past by different oligarch clans battling each other. Prime example being their whole electricity production system where one oligarch clan may own one power plant while a rival one in entwined in another and depending on who was in favour with the political leadership long electricity contracts were signed and locked in for years meaning the pricing of electricity made no sense and hurt industry.

Another good example would be KRAZ i Ukraine where different oligarchs may own the actual factory buildings while others own the intellectual property while yet other corporate structures owe wages to the workers etc etc. In such a convoluted environment no one is going to finance such operations or invest/partner with it. 
First all of that has to be untangled before anyone can make any sense of finding a business activity in it. 

Contrast that with MAZ in Belarus which has a ongoing production with quite clear ownership, leadership and active workforce as well as already a history of cooperating with a large German vehicle manufacturer MAN. They do not directly compete for the same market segment as MAN thus it would make perfect sense for MAN to step in as a subsystem supplier for MAZ in order to replace Russian components over time as a EU integration process. 

Alternatively MAZ also would have an easier time getting foreign direct investment or credit when compared to say KRAZ.

Reality is that there will be a need to have a net investment in to Belarus from the EU for many years in order to bring the economy up to a certain standard which does not rely on subsidised energy from Russia. 

When ever you have an economy built on subsidised energy that economy will be weak when subjected to real market forces along the whole axis of production. 

Some of the enterprises in Belarus are in reality jobs programs solely functioning on the fact that there has been subsidised energy available. 

In order to gain independence from Russia there will be a period of economic adaptation but as we have seen the EU is willing to invest in countries for decades upon decades in order to bring their economies up to fighting level.",,/r/europe/comments/iaaj4h/belarus_state_tv_channel_is_joining_the/g1pjcsn/,alohalii,1597554491

5126,"&gt; Can a German citizen enjoy their German UBI while living in Greece or Poland ?

Supposedly same rules apply for that as it already does for German benefits. 

&gt;What about multinational EU citizens (I know people with 3+ nationalities). Can they get UBI form all of these countries ?

Again, probably the same rules that exist already, which I don't know. 

&gt;How do you enforce rules that limit these ""abuses"" when unemployed people don't leave much paper trail ?

I do not know. But it's probably a similar case to current cheaters, we don't need to eliminate every single cheater, that costs more money than we save. Simply having some checks and serious enough consequences is probably enough to discourage the vast majority of cheaters, just the fact they could feasibly get caught. 


&gt;Low incentive to work (free rider problem)
&gt;Market distortions (I am actually not worried about that)

I meant that mostly as a combined problem. Because I believe most people want to ""work"" in some form. Very few people want to just sit at home and watch tv all day or whatever. So instead what you get is a lot of people doing something which they could get payed for, if they were good enough at it and there was less competition. I used artist as an example, but could just as easily be streamer or e-sports player too for example. 

Some would say though (and this ties in with some of the other stuff you said), that is something we want, it's not a problem. We would have enough people working essential jobs anyway, and generally our goal with work should not be to maximise economic growth or whatever, it should be to make people happy with their work. I mostly disagree with this and lean more towards what you are saying, which is why I brought this up as a potential problem. 

&gt;But beyond the economic aspect I have ethical issues with the first point. I think every able citizen should carry their weight and try to make life better for everyone. Obviously, there are those who cannot contribute and I believe they receive the help they need in most cases.

&gt;I don't think other people should qualify for ""free stuff"". 

I think the vast majority of people want to contribute to society, just not everyone might want to do it in exactly the way society needs the most. So you got to push them a little bit towards the most ""useful"" jobs, but not actually that much. I don't think people simply not doing anything is a serious issue if it's easy getting work. If it is an issue it is in jobs people don't want to do for various reasons, in which case, make it so people want to do them (by raising wages or whatever), don't force them because they have no other choice. 

&gt;Some would say, a lot of jobs may be redundant in the future. I say, don't train the current/new generations to do these jobs. Instead give them access to an education that allows them to be contributing members of developed nation of the 21th century. Impose caps on the number of students if there are concerns about overcrowding the market in some sectors ( doctors already do that in a number of countries).

I think you are overestimating how much education and stuff is necessary to be contributing members of modern societies. A ton of jobs will be replaced simply by stuff like entertainment and various ""simple"" services like that, not things that requires a lot of education. At least if we manage to redistribute the wealth gained from automated jobs more equally, which I hope we do. 

All of this is also one strength of UBI which I havent touched on (forgot about it), it would also replace student benefits and loans, hopefully allowing anyone in any position in life to be studying if they want to (assuming school is mostly free). Sure it might lead to some people never leaving school, which costs some money. But I just think a more educated society is a massive win, even if it's not massively useful educations, it still helps with so many other areas of society. 

&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, I would like to see the issues surrounding the banking &amp; finance sectors addressed. Imposing restrictions on the secondary capital market (e.g. can't sell shares for more that you bought them after factoring inflation) would be a good way to limit the current exploits in the system without preventing genuine investments ( primary capital market). The primary appeal of shares was supposed to be the dividends. 

I like that idea, had not thought about it like that before. 

&gt; The housing market could also use some more regulations.

Or less, depending on how you look at it and where you are. 

&gt;I believe these are actionable measures that achieve most of the effects of the UBI without most of its downsides but that just me.

I don't see why we could not do both. Obviously we can achieve mostly the same result in other ways than UBI, in most cases we already are to a large degree. UBI is mostly an effort to simplify our systems, both for the ease of citizens, but also to make the system more watertight. And especially the focus is on reducing admin and bureaucracy tied to our current welfare systems. I think the main benefit is psychological, it doesn't actually change much in practice, just how people view things. 

I have no idea how to actually roll out UBI or properly test it without it being a massive risk though. It could cause a lot of economic damage if rolled out all at once, and it's very difficult doing it bit by bit.

--- 

I touched on this a little bit, but another big advantage of UBI is the freedom it gives to especially low wage workers to quit their jobs or decline jobs that don't pay well enough or stuff like that.

I agree EU should have a joint military at least some sort if we want to project power overseas.

Unfortunately we are on the wrong side of the international law in Libya as UN recognized government is GNA. That doesn’t mean our actions are not justified. However most EU countries are neutral to the issue or they do not care as they are too far away.

We should always be aware that when we are getting involved in other countries (conficts like in Greece) we are not representing EU. We may be defending EU interests but let’s be honest a more neutral Turkey will massively benefit some EU countries and that’s why no one seems to act as strong as France.

The Iraq Body Count, which relies mostly on information from news sources, also presents some gender disaggregated information where it is available. In a dossier they reported that out of the 24 965 civilian casualties they had counted by 19 March 2005 they knew the gender of 13 811; 82 per cent of which were adult males (Iraq Body Count 2005). Obermeyer et al also report a much higher rate of violent war deaths amongst men in the 13 countries they have survey data from (Obermeyer et al 2008). Lastly, in the survey from DRC the deaths due to violence were also most common amongst men (Coghlan et al 2008). Interestingly, this study which unlike the others also takes into account indirect deaths after the war, appears to indicate that more men than women die overall (ibid)
___________
In  a  widely  respected study on war mortality in Kosovo, Spiegel and Salama (2000) found that men were 8.9 times more likely to die from war-related trauma than women, which coincides with men being systematically targeted. In addition, they compared  sex-specific  rates  within  the  age  strata  and  found  that  men  and  women  aged  0–14  years  had  a  similar  mortality  rate  from  war-related  trauma,  whereas men of military age (15–49 years) and men 50 years and older were 10.8 (2.7–42·2) and 9.6 (2.4–37.6) times more likely to die of war-related trauma than were women in their respective age-groups.",,/r/europe/comments/ia7aj0/polish_women_protesting_against_the_withdrawing/g1p8ejq/,finitewaves,1597547044

Greece’s agreement came as a response to the Turkish - Libyan one. The one passing through the Greek islands. Until the issue is resolved on whether or not islands have EEZ, resolved between both parties, not what one thinks is right, they shouldn’t have done it. Perhaps Greece was wrong as well, but I can justify them,

5441,"Unfortunately, the debate on reddit is often way too politically-charged on such questions. There has been no conflict with Russia on such technical issue as synchronisation area so far. I'm not even sure if Russia would technically be able to do that without risking blackout for St. Petersburg.

However, there's definitely little trust from either side towards energy trade. Russia tried to build an NPP in Kaliningrad as a rival project to new Lithuanian NPP (was stopped by a referendum later) but AFAIK, it was cancelled for the Belarusian NPP. It's clear Russia wants to sell energy to Baltics, but there are questions of energy security and unfair competition (Russian borderlands selling to EU market without following EU standards) from our side. What is more, Russia has built an isolated Kaliningrad electricity network altogether after it found out Baltics are preparing to switch to Central European grid.

The talk about ""Russia cutting electricity supply"" sounds far-fetched to me. Russia has halted rail freight to Estonia for political reasons, but that is several notches milder than sabotage of essential infrastructure. It almost sounds like they are overblowing the threat on purpose to get more EU support. Namely, the European Commission has planned generous support for the ""essential project"". While it makes sense for Baltics to be connected to European grid rather than Russian, there are still cost-benefit analysis to take into account.

Maybe I'm being too critical about our national grid company and they know what they're doing, but to me, it seems this project is led by mistrust towards Russia and some general ""European integration"" notion, but I'm not sure if the enormous price (over a billion euros, much of it covered by EU taxpayer) is actually worth it.",Eesti,/r/europe/comments/iad7b7/estonia_latvia_and_lithuania_are_preparing_to/g1o5aym/,toreon,1597532269

Armenia independence: **September 21, 1991**

Operation Ring: **30 April–15 May 1991**

&gt; Soviet troops and the **predominantly Azerbaijani soldiers** in the AzSSR OMON and army **forcibly uprooted Armenians living in the 24 villages** strewn across Shahumyan to leave their homes and settle elsewhere in Nagorno-Karabakh or in the neighboring Armenian SSR.[3] Following this, the **Armenian inhabitants of 17 villages across the Shushi and Hadrut regions were forcibly removed**. British journalist Thomas de Waal has described Ring as the Soviet Union's first and only civil war.[4] Some authors have also described the actions of the joint Soviet and **Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing**.[5] The military operation was accompanied by **systematic and gross human rights abuses.**

&gt; Human rights organizations documented a wide number of human rights violations and abuses committed by Soviet and Azerbaijani forces. These included **forced deportations of civilians, unlawful killings, torture, kidnapping harassment, rape and the wanton seizure or destruction of property**.[35][36][37][38][39][40] Despite fierce protests, no measures were taken either to prevent the human rights abuses or to punish the perpetrators.[38] Approximately **17,000 Armenians** living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.[41]

&gt; ***Azerbaijani officials, including President of Azerbaijan Ayaz Mualibov and the second secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan Victor Polyanichko, keep on approving these deportations, presenting them as a voluntary resetting of the inhabitants of NKAO. However, we have irrefutable evidence proving that these actions were carried out with a brutal use of force and weaponry, which led to murders, mutilations and the loss of personal property.[42]***

Read the link. The first president of Azerbaijan made a deal with Gorbachev for Azerbaijan SSR to vote to stay in the USSR (which it did) in exchange for approval for the ethnic cleansing of Nagorno Karabakh. It was approved and executed but halted because of the coup in Moscow where Yeltsin came to power and Gorbachev was ousted.

5589,"Greece is an archipelago country and Kastellorizo is part of the Dodecanese, it's not a single island on the other side of the atlantic. Those things could make the ruling different. You're claiming that Turkey is a special case but so is Greece because it has thousands of islands. In any case, Turkey would have to go to the international court in order to seek a similar ruling. Good luck with that. 

Also the island isn't insignificant. I'm not sure what makes it insignificant. UNCLOS doesn't make a distinction based on significance. If anything, due to its location i'd say it's important. The turkish coast also has a lot of places that are empty. Do they also get reduced EEZ somehow? 

I like how you guys have taken on calling the Greek claims ""maximalistic"". As opposed to what? Giving out our EEZ? Greek claims stem from the EEZ that UNCLOS mentions so for Greece as a signatory nation, they're not maximalistic, they're just what we can claim. Can you give me an example of Turkey being liable to claim X territory and instead claiming less in order to not be maximalistic? Turkey claims 6 n.m. in the Aegean and even has a casus belli against Greece in the case of expanding to 12 n.m. as the international law mentions, yet in the Black Sea Turkey has extended its waters to 12 n.m. despite not having signed the treaty.

I condemn (for example) the fact that North Korea doesn’t treat its people humanely (in my point of view). If a North Korean told me “hey why so negative? We are just thinking differently” I would reply that I am condemning that very different way of thinking. 
If you consider your “nationalistic” views as different thinking, people will bash those exact thoughts. Why would you expect it otherwise? Or, even better, what exactly did you expect? 

Regarding your first point of what nationalism is for a Turk, I could argue that in the past 100 years many countries faced difficulties. But most of them moved on, changing their attitude to better fit a globalized world. Whether or not nationalism “helped” turkey stay strong or whatnot is irrelevant. They should move on and cling to something different, since in my opinion nationalism rarely brings the best out of people, but rather the worse.

Lastly I honestly don’t think that turkey and Turkish people are getting “insulted” just because of the EEZ. This was just the latest thing of a long line of stuff that most people find debatable at best in turkeys stance. I doubt that anyone would be so negative if it was only the EEZ. However, I feel that you paint a picture of turkey being always the victim, being always invaded, people trying to steal the EEZ etc, and I don’t think that any country in the world would want something like this, i.e. to treat one specific country bad all the time. I just fear that (as many nationalists before) you see enemies all around coveting your country and resources, trying to undermine you, and so on, while you’re all alone because of a...

People don't insult Turkish users here because their point of view is different. People insult Turkish users in here because Turkey thinks that it should get special treatment in the EEZ situation because it refuses to sign an agreement that 163 countries have signed, because it's against its interests and so these users support Erdogan (whether you like or dislike Erdogan is irrelevant, it just so happens that you support your government in this) when he sends a research vessel escorted by warships to conduct research in an area that virtually everyone else agrees that it should be Greek EEZ. That's trying to enforce Turkey's unsupported view on the matter, with gunboats. No shit you'll get insulted for supporting that.

We get it, you don't like that deal, you think Turkey big, Turkey stronk, Turkey should have more. Well it doesn't always work like that. Sometimes some deals based on geography don't favor you. In this case it favors the country that has 3000 islands and a coastline, and not the country that has just a coastline. You don't like this and you protest but you have to understand that you protesting doesn't make you right and everyone else wrong. Maybe you're wrong and you're just unwilling to accept it so you dub everyone else that tells you that, a racist prick that attacks Turkish users just because ""they have a different opinion"".

5657,"The anti-discrimination agency of the European Union - the EU Fundamental Rights Agency - refuted media myths about the scale of violence against women in Poland - it is the country with the lowest scale of violence against women among EU countries. This does not only apply to the official scale of violence, i.e. the reported one, but the real one. The study was conducted on a large group of 42,000 women from all 28 Member States of the European Union, providing them with mental comfort through isolation from partners. Moreover, Poland not only has the lowest scale of violence, but is also at the forefront of countries where cases of violence against women are most frequently reported. This is the largest attempt so far to diagnose the situation of women in EU countries. 

In addition to that there is thesis that there are fewer cases of such violence in Catholic countries than in Protestant countries. Of course , everything that contradicts the propaganda line is successively ignored and questioned.

The most ridiculous are the headlines from countries like Denmark, published there because they leave this shady convention. They show the Polish family beaten by the father. Perhaps they would better take care of their own backyard, because the aforementioned report shows that the scale of violence against women there is 2.5 times higher than in Poland.

Personally, I am tired of this chauvinism towards countries such as Poland. Any study that makes it better than Western Europe or Scandinavia is immediately questioned and considered a mistake.

In this case, it is not fear for the fate of women that causes such a stir. Women in Poland do better than anywhere else",,/r/europe/comments/ia7aj0/polish_women_protesting_against_the_withdrawing/g1mud6z/,bienkoff,1597517719

5702,"&gt;there were more azerbaijani deaths than armenian, around 5 times more during the war.

Idk why you're trying to turn this into a dick but if you're referring to civilian deaths, then you basically pulled that out of your ass. There is no way you can get me a neutral source with civilian death figures, where the number of civilians killed on the Azerbaijani side is 5x those killed on the Armenian side. 

&gt;and a lot more azerbaijanis got displaced from their homes.

This, unlike the previous statement, is actually true. The number of displaced Azerbaijanis is 2-3~x those of displayed Armenians, and the reason for that is simple: Armenians won the war, and didn't need to leave Artsakh. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan were emptied of Azerbaijanis and Armenians respectively, with the differentiating factor being Artsakh. Had Armenians lost the war, the numbers would've been flipped.

The holocaust killed quite a bit more than 6 million people, as not only Jews were killed. If you include the persecution of communists, handicapped people, political opponents, and homosexuals, the death count reaches 11 million people.

Secondly, you are comparing a regime that only lasted 12 years to a regime that lasted 69 years. If we use the numbers that you provided and calculate the number of people killed per year, then Nazi Germany killed 500,000 people per year compared to 289,855 per year from the USSR.

Turkey's first invasion of Cyprus was justified; Turkey had the legal right to protect the Turkish community from inter-communal violence as specified by the agreement made between Britain and the Republic of Cyprus when independence was granted. Additionally, Greece violated that same agreement by trying to annex Cyprus; the agreement said either Britain, Greece or Turkey could use force to prevent a union between Greece OR Turkey and Cyprus.

Turkey's second invasion was unjustified, opportunistic and brutal. Greece had already been prevented from annexing Cyprus and the Greek military junta had collapsed. The second invasion involved widespread ethnic cleansing and atrocities against civilians. If that doesn't fit your narrative of Turkey as justified and righteous, so be it.

5813,"&gt;For more than 70 years Nato has kept the peace in Europe. Now two of its member states, Greece and Turkey, are on the brink of conflict not with an external enemy but with each other. This week Greece placed its armed forces on high alert. Not since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 has the danger of war been so pressing.  
&gt;  
&gt;The immediate reason is the countries’ competing claims to natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean. The wider cause is the mercurial conduct of President Erdogan of Turkey. The countries’ Nato allies and the European Union, to which Greece belongs and Turkey is linked in a customs union, should urge negotiation. Yet arbitration should not be mistaken for equidistance. Turkey’s claims and conduct are not defensible. Greece can reasonably expect its allies to state this to Mr Erdogan, who, like his ally Vladimir Putin, is wont to engage in brinkmanship.  
&gt;  
&gt;The eastern Mediterranean basin has abundant energy resources in the form of deep-sea gasfields. Their exploration over the past decade might have been a catalyst for regional co-operation and the resolution of longstanding disputes. Instead, it has taken these conflicts to another level. Ankara insists that the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"" must benefit from the gas reserves that surround Cyprus. It opposes the actions of the Republic of Cyprus and of international energy companies in exploiting these resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;No other country recognises ""Northern Cyprus"". The Republic of Cyprus, an EU member state, is the legitimate government for the whole island. Turkey has long insisted that the government in Nicosia has no authority to sign agreements and award concessions over drilling rights unless it comes to an agreement with Northern Cyprus over revenue sharing. There is no basis for this claim, and in the meantime the Republic of Cyprus has co-operated with Egypt, Greece, Israel, Jordan, Italy and the Palestinian Authority to establish a regional energy authority to co-ordinate policies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ankara sent a seismic survey ship, the *Oruc Reis*, this week to conduct research in waters around Greek islands. Turkish governments have long claimed that the country and its Cypriot enclave have the right to benefit from the region’s energy reserves. Turkey balks especially at Greek insistence that each of the hundreds of Greek islands in the Aegean has its own continental shelf and rights to surrounding resources. Yet Greece’s claim for territorial waters surrounding the islands is in accord with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which Turkey is not a signatory.  
&gt;  
&gt;In effect, Turkey is declaring its unwillingness to abide by legal requirements in the resolution of disputes over territory and resources. The danger that this could spark conflict is acute. Turkey is a substantial naval power. EU states have hastened to dial down the tension, with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, issuing a direct appeal to Mr Erdogan to pull back. President Macron of France has unequivocally backed Greece.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Erdogan has shifted the position of Turkey in the international order, and not in a good way. If Turkey negotiates in good faith, then energy competition ought to be capable of resolution. Yet Nato cannot have a member state that refuses to live within its long-established borders and encroaches on Greek and Cypriot waters. That is a non-negotiable principle, and its leaders should lose no time in impressing it upon Mr Erdogan.",,/r/europe/comments/ia8kmt/the_times_view_on_tensions_between_greece_and/g1lijf7/,free_thinker001,1597502905

5822,"1.

*Should we consider covid a threat when it infected only 1 person in Wuhan ?*

*Is covid no longer a threat once we have worldwide vaccine next year ?*

*Is an illness no longer a threat once we find the medicine ?*

Here's a [plot I made](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/okjffe0zua) showing projected population loss from LGBT only using percentage from [here]
   (https://www.statista.com/chart/6466/europes-lgbt-population-mapped/). The top line is for 6% LGBT, the lower line is for conservative estimate of 3%. It's basically a [geometric sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) using with `a = r = lgbt_percentage` 
   
The 6% looks scarily exponential, losing half of the population after only ~12 generations (12*11=132 yrs, 11 is the distance between generations: boomers, genX, genY, genZ, ...), and practically extinct after ~26 generations, falling below [critical mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) of 20%. Meanwhile the 3% line looked more flat, a lot more manageable. Supporting argument against LGBT normalization.
    
   
A bit meta, but there's two steps 'translation' from actual threat to our 'fear level'
   
    [threat] ---------------&gt; [a number] ----------------&gt; [psychological fear]
                 rational                    irrational 
              risk analysis                   emotion
 
Seeking agreement in this matter is actually asking us to synchronize our 'fear level': an impossible thing. Even now after so many deaths many people in the world still do not fear COVID. And let us remember that the whole world slept on covid while it was still in China. Sleeping on exponential growth.

&gt; LGBT is not an abstraction

&gt; it's a set of features on the spectrum of human biological variety

Looks contradictive to me. A set of features IS an abstraction (mental construct). To be clear, by abstraction I mean *the opposite* of something material/physical/tangible/legible/in-the-world. Honestly, mixing different level of abstractions is the crux of the problem. Unable to separate what's fundamental/real and what's not.

&gt; You can't enforce denial of those categories, they will spring back into existence

I'm not advocating for denial. Acknowledge/understand the problem for what it is, fix it at the root. Mental problem ? psychiatry. Social problem ? sociology/law. Hormone problem ? biology. Self image ? psychiatry. Don't mix/leak up different things. It's so confused now the problem leaks up to many different fields (marriage, etc).

&gt; The overwhelming amount of medical data suggests that transition and acceptance are of a great help

Fixing the wrong thing (mental/social/software problem but solved biologically/hardware). See the motivations of those who transition and the regrets of those who detrans. See whether you think it's the right solution or not. However I have to admit that we don't have better alternative, our knowledge on mental health currently sucks.

&gt; My point is about the origins of abstractions

Show me one gender artifact that's not in relation to / not referring to sex. It's not independent, it's derived from sex, the actual reality.

3.

No. Without the human, that pyramid won't exist at all. LGBT reduces human.
Also read my earlier comment. Amongst those that amplify human capability, the one that 'fit human' better wins in the long run.

4.

&gt; moral consensus is based not on the amount of categories we have, but on the variance between specific aspects

Works the same. just replace the word ""category"" to those variance/range/moral-frameworks, etc. The more variance/frameworks the less GCF.

&gt; not from additional abstraction, but from difference in philosophical and moral frameworks

So reduce those differences then (merge/join/compromise). Don't add additional moral frameworks.
A bit pedantic, but philosophical and moral frameworks are abstraction too.

5.

&gt; the race will matter as much in our treatment of other people as their hair color currently

Ok, misunderstood.

&gt; fundamental doesn't mean that we should stick to it

We were discussing this in the context of making consensus/law. It's not that we *should* stick to it. It's impossible to make consensus based on arbitrary mapping so full of contradictions.

Its baffling to me that most people arent educated on how communism was percieved by the majority of Western Europe. People were scared to fall into the hands of that regime. 
Today's narrative seems to favour communism as ""one of the good guys"" even with the aknowledgement of horodomor, the great purge and ethnic cleansing done prior and throughout the 2nd world war. 
As bad as the Nazi regime was, they no where near killed as many as Stalin did. 
The USSR has done more atrocities than any regime in the world, even going as far as completely vanishing a lake( with all the natural disasters caused by it), holding the world hostage in fear of a full out nuclear war. Yet we still have numb nuts declaring communism is good.

5859,"&gt; You might compare him to Salvador Allende.

A compeltely naive idiot who could not control his own party and tried to rule above the law?

Do you know Allende was getting impeached for gross misconduct, arbitray law enforcement, bulldozing separation of powers, applying laws that did not exist, not recognizing parts of the constitution, tampering with the supreme court, arbitrarily granting pardons, and other stuff? Hell, even Allende gave himself judicial authority and able to make court rulings, depsite that being a completely blatant power abuse. Winning an election does not grant you the mandate to ignore all laws and declare yourself above the law.

Impeachement procedures were started by Congress in August 1973 due to gross violations of law, constituion, separation of powers, and other bad stuff. Like:

-Trying to pass laws without Congress.

-Tampering with judge appointments.

-Tampering with court resolutions.

-Tampering with the Supreme Court.

-Tampering with media.

-Blocking opposition media.

-Trying to illegally expropriate land.

-Stopped equality under the law, by being easy on crimes by the left.

-Tampered with freedom of speech.

-Harassed non-leftist universities.

-Harassed and tampered freedom of association.

-Interfered with freedom of schooling.

-Illegal arrests with political goals.

-Arbitrarily ended trade unions' autonomies (galaxy brain move for a socialist).

-Imposed travel restrictions despite no law allowed for that.

-Usurped Congress' power so he could rule by decree.

-Removed all investigative powers from Congress.

-Refused to adopt laws already approved by Congress, especially constitutional changes which are beyond the scope of the president. That is, not recognizing the constitution.

-Compeltely one-sided use of presidential pardons by releasing en masse only leftist criminals.

-Attempted against separation of powers, including granting judicial powers to the president.

-Tampered and ignored all investigative powers from government accounting organizations.

I could go on.

Here is the source, the accord made by Congress to start his impeachment, in legalese Spanish:

5917,"Yes we do (although to a much lesser and strict extant as the US), but it's a bit different for some product type especially food, most of europe has grown for historical reason to a system that doesn't really exist in the US. 

In France it's stuff like AOC (name of controller origin), AOP (name of protected origin), ... Meaning even if it becomes the generic name it's protected. The region / area / ... Request to get the label for its product to the state, and if it is accepted (unique, historical, ...) a very specific geographic area is delimited and a control group/agency to ensure conformity. 

To be able to use the name a product must be inside that specific area, and depending on which AOC/AOP/... respect specific production methods during controls. It leads to protection of the areas, guarantees on the product, but also to massive value increase for the land (even if you are respecting all the same rules, producing exactly like them etc ... If you are 5 meters outside the Champagne area your product will never be allowed to bear the name).

It always seems a bit weird to notably american because while they understand protecting the name for quality of product / rules of production / ... They don't really get that a product that fit every criteria still can't have the name because eg its production site is a kilometer too far to the east.

But the thing is, it's because all of these (the cheese, the wines, the meat, ...) grew historically when trademark and copyright didn't really exist the way they are now, so their place of origin IS their trademark. Some wine and cheese are moving in the other direction and you know the specific winery, or the cheese brand, but the vast majority did not.

So yeah, ""Champagne"" and ""Brie de Meaux"" are generic name and / or the name of a geographical place and it seems weird to protect a specific product to that, but THAT is their trademark, and they didn't chose this ""instead of"" normal trademark, they were made that way before the concept of trademark as we undertstand it now even came to exist.

5932,"Well, this photo is slightly off of the diamond anniversary as that was taken September 2nd when they were actually signing the instrument of surrender. August 15th is the day when the prior day’s coup intended to prolong the war failed and their emperor got on the radio to announce their surrender, albeit in somewhat oblique fashion with classical Japanese that his own subjects didn’t really understand well. Here’s an English translation... lots of detestable propaganda in it (lmao at Japan not seeking territorial aggrandizement and striving for common happiness with the shit that was being pulled across the countries they were occupying) but there are some incredible lines in there. “The war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage,” indeed.

&gt; TO OUR GOOD AND LOYAL SUBJECTS,

&gt; After pondering deeply the general trends of the world and the actual conditions obtaining in our empire today, we have decided to effect a settlement of the present situation by resorting to an extraordinary measure.

&gt; We have ordered our government to communicate to the governments of the United States, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that our empire accepts the provisions of their joint declaration.

&gt; To strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations as well as the security and well-being of our subjects is the solemn obligation which has been handed down by our imperial ancestors and which lies close to our heart.

&gt; Indeed, we declared war on America and Britain out of our sincere desire to ensure Japan's self-preservation and the stabilization of East Asia, it being far from our thought either to infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark upon territorial aggrandizement.

&gt; But now the war has lasted for nearly four years. Despite the best that has been done by everyone – the gallant fighting of the military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of our servants of the state, and the devoted service of our one hundred million people – the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest.

&gt; Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.

&gt; Such being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, or to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the powers.

&gt; We cannot but express the deepest sense of regret to our allied nations of East Asia, who have consistently cooperated with the Empire towards the emancipation of East Asia.

&gt; The thought of those officers and men as well as others who have fallen in the fields of battle, those who died at their posts of duty, or those who met with untimely death and all their bereaved families, pains our heart night and day.

&gt; The welfare of the wounded and the war-sufferers, and of those who have lost their homes and livelihood, are the objects of our profound solicitude.

&gt; The hardships and sufferings to which our nation is to be subjected hereafter will be certainly great. We are keenly aware of the inmost feelings of all of you, our subjects. However, it is according to the dictates of time and fate that We have resolved to pave the way for a grand peace for all the generations to come by enduring the unendurable and suffering what is unsufferable.

&gt; Having been able to safeguard and maintain the Kokutai, We are always with you, our good and loyal subjects, relying upon your sincerity and integrity.

&gt; Beware most strictly of any outbursts of emotion which may engender needless complications, or any fraternal contention and strife which may create confusion, lead you astray and cause you to lose the confidence of the world.

&gt; Let the entire nation continue as one family from generation to generation, ever firm in its faith in the imperishability of its sacred land, and mindful of its heavy burden of responsibility, and of the long road before it.

&gt; Unite your total strength, to be devoted to construction for the future. Cultivate the ways of rectitude, foster nobility of spirit, and work with resolution – so that you may enhance the innate glory of the imperial state and keep pace with the progress of the world.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/ia517r/today_is_the_75th_anniversary_of_vj_day_marking/g1kyrn3/,sparkling_uranium,1597495854

5940,"&gt;Nowhere in the BBC article was something that contradicts anything I said. The EU and specifically Germany is pushing for dialogue. Yeah but on what terms? Dialogue is being proposed for the Cyprus issue as well with decades going nowhere.


It was getting there, especially since Turkey due to economic troubles need the EU to help. A reason they accepted the talks.


&gt;I am all for dialogue if you could read some of my previous comments (some are in greek) I actually proposed a possible deal. But dialogue on the bases of the Turkish claims is not possible.

Those are claims. are close to the possible maximun. What will be the effect will be seen by the treaty. Also Greek claims are far from acceptable for Turkey. So a compromise must be made. 


&gt;As for article 7 and 15, it is what you claim for the ""blue homeland"" as well just because some islands are closer to the Turkish mainland. Well, thankfully no one else understands it the same way you do and by the way, if it provides enough for Turkey to lay claim on it why it hasn't signed it?

USA is also not a signatory and is also pressing for a dialogue and it's action in South China Sea are mostly based on that too. 

And pointing out that the treaty. That Turkey didn't ratify orginally due to the Aegan dispute. I not saying Greece claims are wrong. I'm not all at the Blue homeland, especially as it against the treaty. As inhabited island have an EEZ stated by the treated. But the treaty also state that they must be a treaty about the EEZ in that case until then it's legal gray ground. 

But just saying bad Germany, because it's trying to solve the issue and the last exploration ended with the prentense of that. Greece is not in the right until we have a treaty.  And I mostly cover greece claims the large issue is Kastellorizo anyway. That why I pointed out article 7. 
Turkey can have legal objection to some greek Claims and the deal with Egypt falls into that problem. It's not the Cyprus issue, it's not the Aegan issue were it's pretty clear and Turkey is being unreasonable.
