You cannot call everything undemocratic if there’s plenty of people who don’t vote at all imo. This all stems from people believing they know better or being willing to destroy a countries culture in the name of the greater good.

112,"And he won’t be able to keep the game going for much longer.
An employee sorts Turkish lira banknotes at a bank in the town of Sarmada in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province on June 14.

 

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not usually known as an economic innovator. But for the past year, his government has been running a high-stakes economic experiment. The test: How long can Turkey hide the fact that it is spending far beyond its means? Normally when governments spend more than they tax, the difference appears as a budget deficit. They fund that deficit by issuing bonds, which are traded on international markets and so are easy to track. If the debt load grows too large, and if borrowing costs spike, then then country must default or seek a bailout. This type of debt crisis isn’t pleasant, as Argentina or Greece or Pakistan could attest, but it is at least straightforward and familiar.

Turkey has also spent well more than it should, but it has done so in way that hid the costs deep in its financial system, leaving them invisible to all but the most committed financial sleuths. There’s relatively little sovereign debt—the type usually funded by international bonds—to be found, though its overall value is ticking up somewhat. The big borrowing has been by the country’s banks, including both private and state-owned banks—and that is where Turkey’s trouble has built up.

Since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low, hoping to spur an economic recovery in the United States. This had the side effect of making it cheap to borrow dollars, for both Americans and for anyone else looking for credit. Turkish banks took note and binged on cheap dollar loans.

And so Turkey’s banks came to have lots of dollars. What to do with them? First, they lent the dollars to Turkish firms, in industries such as tourism, energy, infrastructure, and real estate, which preferred loans in dollars rather than lira due to the cheap interest rates on offer. Sectors like infrastructure and real estate sell primarily to Turks, so their revenues are priced in Turkish lira. But their loan repayments were still in dollars. The problem is that, if the lira fell against the dollar—and it has fallen substantially over the past few years—it would become harder for Turkish firms to repay their dollar loans. And that, in turn, could lead to a banking crisis.

Not all the dollars that Turkish banks borrowed from abroad were given out to Turkey’s companies. Individual Turks mostly take out loans to buy houses or cars in lira, not dollars. So Turkey’s banks needed lira to lend them. The banks took the dollars they had accumulated and swapped them into lira on financial markets, paying a fee linked to the lira interest rate set by the Turkish central bank. This created a second risk burrowed deep in the country’s banking system: If interest rates rise, the cost of banks’ lira borrowing would shoot upward, cutting into bank profits.

Fast forward to the past few months. As COVID-19 slammed into the global economy, emerging markets such as Turkey were hard hit. The lira lost 10 percent of its value in March and April alone. When the lira falls, the price of imported goods rises, and Turks’ living standards fall. Fearing a backlash, Turkey’s government decided to stop the lira from falling further. It used a standard tactic, selling dollars to buy up lira on the open market, bolstering the value of Turkey’s currency. For most of the summer, this trick worked: The lira was steady at around 6.85 to the dollar for almost all of June and July.

But spending dollar reserves to defend the value of your currency only works so long as you have dollars to spend.

  
The government started the year with far fewer reserves than it should have, and it soon faced demand for more spending, as Erdogan insisted that the currency be defended. Where to find more dollars?

 
This is where Turkey’s banks come back in. They had an excess, having borrowed billions from abroad in previous years. So Turkey’s central bank began borrowing dollars from the country’s own banks, too. The central bank owes $54 billion—dollars, not lira—to Turkey’s banks. But it spent even more than that, around $65 billion already this year, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs, on top of an additional $40 billion in 2019. So according to the most recent data released by Turkey’s government, the central bank is facing a shortfall of around $25 billion, once you subtract the funds they hold in gold and Qatari riyal.

A big hole is not what you want in your central bank’s balance sheet, but this it is the reality that Turkey faces. It is no longer possible to defend the lira at its level of earlier this summer. It has already slipped by several percent in value, and a steeper fall seems only a matter of time.

What options does Erdogan have? The path ahead is strewn with risks. Let the lira fall, and Turkish companies with dollar debts will struggle to pay them bank. A steep decline in the lira could even make Turkey’s banks go bust. Hike interest rates, and currency might stabilize, but the economy would be thrown into a deeper recession, exacerbating the coronavirus slump and denting Erdogan’s popularity. Both options are dangerous. But doing nothing is probably worse: The lira will fall anyway, and the economy will sink into a prolonged recession, too. Erdogan’s economic experiment was interesting while it lasted, generating a false sense of stability. But hiding the country’s economic problems deep in the banking system was never more than a temporary cover-up.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/j1vchv/erdogan_has_hidden_an_economic_disaster_deep_in/g71iw5q/,ZmeiOtPirin,1601368486

The casual link lower NGO presence -&gt; lower drownings isn’t proven either, but in the absence of a major change in push factors, European policy must be doing _something_ right in saving lives in the med. whether because of a lower NGO presence, deals with other states, pushbacks, or whatever.

The one thing we can conclusively say is that there is no casual link between a higher NGO presence -&gt; fewer drownings.",,/r/europe/comments/j1a57d/greek_police_arrest_33_ngo_members_for_human/g71j8ao/,Stralau,1601368881

143,"&gt;Well, those that move for high school are 15 when they move out. 

15 or 16. 

&gt;If 10% move out for high school at the age of 15, the average age to move out for the rest has to be 18.1. If that share is 15%, the average for the rest has to be 19.2. That’s not an unreasonable number. 

Well at the age of 18.1 you havent finished high school and if you havent moved out for high school already this is extremely unlikely to be when the rest of people move out. 19.2 does sound more likely but then again not everyone study in university directly after High school and even if you have a job directly after there is a wait to get a apartment in most municipalities that actually have jobs and you cant afford houses that early either. This is the norm for most Swedes, its a lot worse for Stockholm and Gothenburg. More than one fourth of Stockholms young adults aged 20-27 still live at home because its too expensive to move. Its less of an issue in the rest of Sweden but its not exactly cheap even in small cities like mine with 6000 people, a new apartment with one room will cost you 700-900€...  The old ones are usually never sold because they are so cheap.

&gt;So really, we just need to figure out how many kids move out for high school to see if the data makes sense.

Well we kinda have the statistics on that? According to SCB 92% of all teens aged 18 at the end of 2011 lived at home and in 2015 the same people now aged 22 at the end of 2015 46% of them had still yet to move out. (52% of men, 39% of women) Women were to a greater extent at the age of 22 in 2015 living in a household with a partner and be married. But SCB also claims the average age to move out is roughly 20-21.",Kungariket Sverige,/r/europe/comments/j19txa/average_age_at_which_europeans_leave_their/g71j8x7/,weirdowerdo,1601368903

179,"Sure, it has several points to consider:
1. Based on the Residency, cities and towns are getting their taxes payed from the government used for infrastructure builds and repairs. This is a problem especially for my hometown of Bratislava. Since it is a capital, meaning universities, bigger employers and such, there is plenty of people that have moved there whilst still maintaining Residence in their hometowns. This leads to a situation where the city has population officially around 450k, but unofficially it can be up to 700-800k, but the city only gets taxes from 450k and as such suffers from lack of funding.
2. The landlords are not obliged to give you residency in their property. Many won’t do it, afaik it creates a problem when eviction comes to a place. Also the process of obtaining residency from landlord hasn’t changed in decades. Tenant and landlord will have to go personally to the bureau with a document saying that the landlord is the owner of the property and agrees to give you the permanent residency there. Afterwards the tenant needs to get a new ID as our IDs always have an address of permanent residency on them.

As people pointed out, nothing really changes for you if you don’t change your residency, there are no fines or anything, so no one cares to change it. But as you can see in 1. it is problematic for the cities to maintain infrastructure used by hundreds of thousands more than they are getting payed on.

I have even recently seen banks refuse to allow a toll road to be paid down ahead of schedule because it would muck up their projections.

Also, having the people, and companies, have a total debt level around 200% of GDP is apparently an invitation for recession or even depression.

And it does not even require a complete halt in lending for it to be nasty, only a reduction in the issuing of new loans (and thus less new money injected into the economy). Because this means that existing debt become that much harder to service, inviting a domino chain of defaults.

Another trash thing, and technically fraud, claim your kid as a dependent, when they've lived on their own two years, and haven't got dime one from a parent.

Because of this, and the fact it's hard to prosecute, you get a ton of emancipated minors at 17, even when it's only months until they're 18. It's a firewall for identity theft, tax fraud, and other various things. 80% of the time, the parent is a junkie, gambling addiction, money problems sort. 20% of time, cult religions, psychopath parents, and other issues.

Sometimes, the Armenians won't because they actually don't like committing war crimes. Sometimes, the Azeris use the position to fire on Armenian villages, and when that happens Armenians do try to remove the threat (ie destroy the artillery).

I can attest to this

I studied chemical engineering in college

I had trouble finding a job out of college (maybe my fault, my state isn't chemical industry friendly and I didn't want to move). BUT, I did have some programming experience on the side. So I applied for java programming job, and hey look at that I got the job

Then after training for a month with the company, they got a contract. SAP consulting! They didn't care who, they just needed bodies on that contract. So then I got to learn how terrible Germans are at designing software

I worked on the security/permissions/governance side. Contract ran out years later. Decided to take the Sec+ certification for fun. Why not? It was cool stuff, but it had little to do with what I was doing.

Ended up applying for a job that was way out of my league but required Sec+. Company had questions on me not having all the experience they wanted, told them I took Sec+ cause I liked it (also massaged my experience and how it would apply), and I'm a fast learner that's truly interested in it.

To be honest, if the relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan were peaceful, like EU peaceful, I think most people wouldn't bother to whom it ""officially"" belongs. But I feel like we would be setting a dangerous precedent if we let a country like Armenia get away with military aggression just because ""damage has been done"". That's why I suggested that the incorporation process should be slow. Armenians are extremely traditionalist and obsessed with ""history"". It is all ""we have been living here since 5000 BC"", we are ancient, we have this and that. That is why they love playing the ""oldest christian country"" card as if it is something to be proud of. It really made me disturbed when I first went to the Armenian subreddit and I saw people using old medieval dynasty names as flairs. Azerbaijanis on this regard aren't really much better, but Armenians definitely would give them a run for their money. On top of that, their territorial claims go beyond the territory they have occupied now.

609,"Such an ""eastern"" mindset, I can fully relate.

People in Bosnia and Herzegovina mostly have built huge houses (sometimes even two, one beside the other) after the war in the 90's so that their children would have their own place to live when they get married. That part which was reserved for that child (mostly just the sons as daughters were expected to move out when they get married) was never fully completed as the parents didn't had the funds to finish it so they expected the child would finish it when the need arises. Basically a house with 3 floors (ground floor + 2 floors) is quite common, while with 4 floors isn't unheard for (that is literally a 12+ meter high house).

What happened now? Those children decided that they don't want to live with their parents when they marry, especially not in the suburbs of the cities. In the same time, many of those childrens decided to search for better opportunities outside of the country so those houses stand as half finished with half of them never getting a facade instead of their parents building a decently sized house with a nice garden and parkway, maybe giving a meter or two to the municipality to make a regulation sized street instead of a narrow path which we call a street.",,/r/europe/comments/j19txa/average_age_at_which_europeans_leave_their/g703llw/,AZ-_-,1601332414

(And if you read the pre-Confederation history of Canada you'll see plenty of disparity there even without Quebec, in fact Nova Scotia tried to secede right after joining...)

People on this post who want to roll the clock back may have the right idea I think, and I posted comment to support that. Because it would have been better to observe other examples of federation (not just Canada, but it gets people's attention to bang on about it), see what's necessary, and accept taking time to do things in the right order. Even if it took a lot longer to sell the challenging parts (like fiscal integration, and ceding of national sovereignty) that, in my mind, are vital prerequisites of the desirable parts (monetary union, single market). 

But perhaps the architects of the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties wanted it all to happen on their watch and in their lifetimes. However, their egos are not a great reason to endure all the trouble now being endured. I truly fear the well of European integration is being poisoned (again).

706,"The major problem for Europe is the culture in most countries. 

There is no risk taking, no interest in becoming big and talents are not paid enough or not really developed. 

If your company goes broke in the US, everyone will still respect you, you tried and took a shot and failed. If that happens in Germany you are regarded as a failure and attacked for it decades later. 

I can only speak for Germany, but here it seems that exceptional talent is neither discovered nor really developed. It is all about making a lot of good engineers rather than also developing exceptional ones. 

I remember how my Iranian father always said how easy my math homework in school was and how it was a lot harder in Iran. I always thought he was exaggerating, after all Germany is a world leader and Iran is not right? Nowadays, my opinion as you can read out of this post has been very negative. How come there is so much talent coming out of Iran, a nation under crushing sanctions that is ruled by a backwards Theocracy? How come a poor farmer boy with uneducated parents can win a fields medal and before that the first woman ever also won it? Just statistical coincidence? Then why is there also so much talent for AI coming out of Iran?

In the end, the hope for Europe in AI/Tech mostly is with France and the UK.

If so, I just hope the rents won’t keep rising like in the last years &amp; the extrem increases  being just a temporary trend, because otherwise berlin will become the most expensive city for sure. 

Oh and idk about Munich or Frankfurt or hamburg, but maybe the overall rents in berlin will always seem cheaper because berlin sprawls out so much. I mean like that flats in hohenschönhausen or in other places that are nearly in brandenburg drag the overall rent down and create a kinda tainted statistic...
The rents in the outskirts of the city are obviously dirt cheap, but no one wants to live there.

Edit: not trying to seem standoffish or not being able to see when I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure that I read that berlin did have the highest increase in rent and is one of the most expensive cities (not sure if this was in proportion to wages, but yea).

Yes, the Russians annexed only part of the principality, not the principality in its entirety. But the part of the principality that was not annexed went on to become Romania and so was outside the scope of my response. The important part that I wanted to highlight since it explains why Romania and Moldova are separate countries is that the area that is now the modern state of Moldova has been separate from Romania for most of its history and has developed a distinct identity because of it.

In Indiana, average household income (two parents) is $78,000.
In Massachusetts, it's $117,000. And in my city, much higher. For the same job.

So although salaries are 30% higher, should home prices be 270% higher than Indiana?

Suppose that depends on the quality of life you're looking for. Families look at local schools. Public education in Massachusetts is ranks the best in the States - and if it was it's own country, would rank ~6th in the world. Politics vary from State to State - so even things like ""is marijuana legal and available to buy in a store?"" add or diminish value to an area. Cultural, historic and culinary pillars. How important is it to have access to museums, galleries, concert venues, clubs, theater, lecture halls, community centers, bars and restaurants? How *walkable* is your community? A lot of my area was designed for foot traffic (pre-automobile), so I can walk to most of the things I need. Healthcare - Massachusetts has a semi-universal system that covers students, poor folks, the unemployed, etc. These things add or diminish value. 

I'm willing to pay more to have Boston as my backyard. Many people aren't and prefer a much cheaper place, farther, with more space.

Also, 150K upfront is 30% down. That's way above normal for the US. 20% is traditionally the number, but that's become increasingly more difficult to hit over the last 20 years.

They wan't to be unified with armenia...because the entire land is ethnically armenians today

its naive(blatantly stupid) to think armenians in karabag will accept being governed by azerbeijan. They will fight, and cooperation will be sparse. It would be incredibly difficult for azerbeijan to govern a karabag that's less than 70% azeri.

Best case scenario is they will be allowed to return to armenia peacefully like the greek cypriots did after the second invasion of cyprus. Although its not unlikely massacres will take place given the ethnic tensions between armenians and turks. also take into account how indifferent the international community has been so far.

They will be asked to leave behind their homes, possessions, and everything else. The same way the turks did in 1993 when leaving karabag.

851,"&gt;This is not the core of the debate, the debate is you don't call antisemit someone who mention a legitimate link between Soros and asylum seekers. Soros gave 18 bill dollars to this matter, this is legitimate to evoke such possibilities. 

No, the core of the debate wheter OSF donated towards the rescue ship NGOs. Also, you haven' actually provided a source for that 18 billion you keep throwing around which you probably should since according to your own link OSF has a yearly budget of $873 million which would mean they would have had to spend ~22 years worth of their budget to get that number and I somehow doubt that.

&gt;Now people are avoiding legal issues, and being accused of human trafficking is obviously one of the potential consequences (see this very thread) so you don't know if OSF is transparent. You DON'T know that. So give me a break with your ""research"" and report.

907,"I did take a look at ID.3, even went on a test drive. I didn't like its interior at all: really bad seats not really supporting you during cornering, really meh ergonomics, overall quality and materials actually a bit sub-par even for VW, more in line with their cheapest trims (even though the one I drove was top of the line). Ride was straight up bad: it's very heavy car on skinny tyres, which automatically gives you quite harsh ride. That's usually trade-off for good handling, but in case of ID.3 there's metric ton of body roll. It also has the same problem as many other EVs, mainly that it's very loud at speed - not necessarily louder than ICE vehicles, but once you remove the ICE noise (which usually is tuned to be quite pleasant 'white noise') you're left with annoying wind and tyre noise.

Right now I'd be closest to getting Mini Cooper SE. It's actually pleasant car to drive and be in. It looks like normal Mini Cooper (with some minor stylistic addons you can spec out of too), it drives close to normal Mini Cooper... but it's EV. Except it has only \~180km range which is about 100 km less than I'd realistically need myself... Other contender is BMW i3, which has the range, but it also looks like someone took 2-series Active Tourer (which is ugly car to begin with) and melted it slightly, and shares some of the ID.3 problems (seats, overall interior quality, ergonomics being compromised etc.).

To put it simply, what I'd really like is 1-series/A-class/A3, but EV. Premium car with premium interior, and in compact body with traditional layout, that's actually fun to get into rather than means to an end. Problem with EVs right now is that ""EV"" part adds so much to costs it's really hard to accept manufacturers cheaping out on other aspects of the vehicle.

I read the ""Local Government Charter of The Rights of The Family"". It is what the title says. It is a proposal to the local governments how to strengthen the families and protect the rights of the parents in matters of local interests (kindergarten, school, local business and law). 

And as far as I understand, the ""Resolution against LGBT ideology"" declares opposition to an ""ideology of the LGBT *movement*"", but neither of the documents actually contain a statement of exclusion of LGBT people from any territory, activities or rights.

Poland is not on the way to extend the rights of LGBT people and there were inappropriate political remarks during the election campaign, but the (foreign) activists and the media just fan the flame like this misleading action and post. Did anyone go to the Poland court to initiate national legal proceedings regarding to this matter? That would be the first step before the whole Europe makes political and legal judgments. I know many people are worried about the situation of sexual minorities not completely unfounded, but I am as much as worried about this new wave of ""paneuropean democracy"", that is based on biased news and political actions instead of facts, legal judgments and decisions.

Ok, London was originally a Roman city so I guess the English wouldnt lose English culture if they ever lost London because it was never there.

In 1930 Vilnius was a majority Polish speaking city, all major educational facilities including the university were also Polish speaking. Vilnius was a centre of Polish culture lots of Polish writers, poets, scientists etc. came from and in terms of cultural influence it was probably 4th most important city in Poland. On the other hand, Lithuanian presence in the city was almost negligible.

1003,"It has been a separate country for centuries, it has only ever been part of Romania for very short periods. It was an independent principality in the Middle Ages and at one time conquered by the Ottomans. And when later the Russians came and kicked the Ottomans out of Europe they decided to make Moldova a part of the Russian Empire.

After the Crimean War Russia was forced to cede parts of Moldova to Romania, but that didn't last long as the Russians simply seized them back a few years later.
Then in WW1 and the chaos of the Russian Revolution Moldova is invaded and occupied by the Romanian Army and the Moldovan parliament votes to become part of Romania. That also didn't last very long, since in 1940 Romania is forced to cede Moldova back to the Soviets.
Romania, which was allied with the Nazis, then tried to seize Moldova again during WW2, which didn't end well as Romania soon found itself invaded by some very angry Russians and got a totalitarian communist government imposed on it.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Moldova declares independence. Then a small region called Transdnyestria which historically wasn't part of Moldova and is inhabited mostly by ethnic Ukrainians rebels and declares its own independence, supported by remnants of the Soviet Army.

The idea of unification with Romania has been discussed in modern Moldovan politics, but while the idea is very popular in Romania, it has never really managed to get a lot of public support in Moldova. A majority of Moldovans  oppose the idea of unification. Moldova has never really been a part of Romania, and so it would be wrong to see ethnic Moldovans simply as Romanians. There is definitely a distinct Moldovan identity, even though they speak the same language.

In the present day, unification with Romania has become even more unlikely because Russia has recovered and is asserting it's influence over the region again.",Friesland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/j17fyb/central_europe_if_google_maps_existed_in_the_year/g6ydmb0/,GreatRolmops,1601303567

If the right of self-determination is concretely applied, it would result in Anarchy. As long as there are groups of at least 2 people, there will be differences in opinion and each time you can make a claim that the other half of the group shouldn't be allowed to decide for the other.

1186,"Somebody might correct me, but from what I know/understand:

&gt;indipendentist symbols

They weren't symbols supporting Catalan independence but supporting jailed politicians. The difference might seem small, but that was part of the debate because the [Junta Electoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junta_Electoral_Central) can't demand to remove all kind of symbols, only the ones that might affect the elections. As an example, in the past, public buildings also showed LGBT flags, banners supporting refugees or feminist messages. A point from Catalan independence leaders was that none of them was a symbol that could be considered to interfere with elections.

&gt;he didn't

Actually he did, but some hours after the deadline was over. I know it doesn't make much difference, but I thought it was worth pointing it out because it seems some international media is getting it wrong.

&gt;Am I missing something?

Something supporters of Torra are sharing on Twitter is that electoral rules are often broken and the sanction has never been inhabilitating the commiter. As an example, in January Pedro Sánchez (current Spain's PM) [was found guilty](https://elpais.com/politica/2020/01/23/actualidad/1579773917_569079.html) of breaking electoral rules too, but the penalty was 'only' a 500 Euros bill.

&gt;How is this not coherent with the law and if is not coherent with the  law why, how is the law getting abused to porpusely target separatists  in this case?

From my understanding, the position of Torra and its supporters is:

1. The Junta Electoral didn't have permission to tell Torra whether he had to remove the banner or not.
2. Even if it could, the penalty seems disproportionate, specially if you compare it with penalties applied to pro-union politicians when they committed similar faults.",,/r/europe/comments/j1a9ha/spanish_court_upholds_ban_on_catalan_leader/g6y37qd/,itssnowinginmars,1601297129

It is just that nobody vocalizes it because of the current situation.

Also, after Azerbaijan became independent, the population of Baku increased due to urbanization and therefore the percentage of minorities in the city decreased.

My parents tell me stories about their neighbors, teachers or friends who were Armenian. Especially teachers have always been praised. They were also known for being great shoemakers as well as handymen.
There were absolutely no clashes with them until 1988 when Armenian SSR started forcefully removing Azerbaijanis from Yerevan and other parts of Armenia. Then

But there have always been hatred from Armenians towards all Azerbaijani people, including Azerbaijani Armenians. Yerevan Armenians considered Baku and Karabakh Armenians to be ""chushkas"", which means something like ""redneck"" or ""villagemen"", and even condemned them for marrying Azerbaijanis.

Marrying other nationalities was also not super great within Azerbaijani community (the conservative people, i.e. grandparents who still have huge say in their offsprings' lives), but there was no special distinction between Armenian or other nationalities. Also both sides would usually soften up after a child was born. I've heard a lot of stories about it.

""The expulsion of Azerbaijanis en masse by Armenian extremists started in 1987 from district of Kapan.[25] According to Azerbaijani statistics, about 40,897 Azerbaijani families were wholly deported. 216 people died during the resettlement,[26] Most of the victims were from northern areas, where refugees poured from districts of Kirovabad formerly; especially to district Gugark, where 11 people were killed.[27] According to information of the KGB, in the Armenian town of Gugark: “…Azerbaijanis were taunted, killed and their houses were pillaged…”[28] 45 of them froze alive on mountains of Lesser Caucasus, 45 disappeared in mountain districts of Armenia, 34 were tortured and killed and 6 people were allegedly killed by Armenian doctors in hospitals.""

That's a bare-faced Trump lie that doesn't even vaguely stand up to scrutiny. [Here's](https://youtu.be/DwAXGuNaVyU) an interview with Joe Biden just yesterday.

Now go and watch your man Trump in an interview for comparison.

&gt;rape

Absolute bullshit. You've got one guy, Trump, with a comprehensive litany of sexual abuse allegations from several dozen women covering much of the last few decades and who is on-the-record boasting about what he thinks he can do to women because he's famous. Then you have a guy, Biden, who had one lone unsubstantiated accusation, and who offered for the full Senate records of the accuser's alleged complaint to be released to the media in response. It's gone nowhere since because there's no indication of any substance to report. I'm not going to engage further with this.

Shame on you for trying to draw a parallel between these two figures - Trump, a charlatan narcissist, and Biden, a guy with a decades-long record as a supporter of the American working class and friend of Europe.

1327,"&gt; I never said any such thing. All of my comments are specificlly listing the rules outside of city limits. I made no such reference to the laws inside of them. 

Again, if you actually knew the laws you are talking about, you'd how stupid and misleading and wrong the shit you said is.

These laws apply outside of cities, except for very few exceptions, where they do not apply inside cities, except for highways (and highwaylike roads).

So saying these laws don't exist on the Autobahn outside of cities. Is just about as wrong as it could possibly be.

Of course specifically criticizing this accurately is kind of an issue, you are right about that, but that's mostly because all of it is complete bullshit.

&gt;I even provided examples where this has been done already.

Okay and in which ways has that been done, because believe me, I can also name an entire fucking state and say that is an ""example"".

&gt;Cities and states DO have the ability to make their own laws regarding speed limits and traffic.

As I said, they can do that, AS IT IS LEGISLATED WITHIN THE STVO. So you know, the STVO still applies either way.

And again, it's still completely fucking irrelevant to the discussion at hand. Because even if I'd agree that you're 100% right on that. That leaves us at you saying ""these laws don't exist on the German Autobahn"", me pointing out that is wrong and then you trying to back yourself up by providing **exceptions** the mere existance of **exceptions** means the fucking law applies, you dimwit.


&gt;and since you've provided no evidence of your own it's clear that you believe your opinion to be true despite the evidence.

Despite the evidence? Mate? What are you smoking you provided no fuckinge evidence except for naming a state. This is no different than me telling you how the laws work. None of it is fucking evidence. Either way: Here are the laws you clearly are unaware exist.

&gt;The [**Police**](https://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/1048668/metra-stin-attiki-shedio-tis-elas-gia-adeies-plateies-meta-ta-mesanuhta/) proceeded to dismantle an organized **slave trade** circuit in [**Lesvos,** ](https://www.protothema.gr/world/article/1047449/metanasteutiko-europaiki-task-force-analamvanei-ti-diaheirisi-tis-neas-domis-metanaston-sti-lesvo/)in which a total of four Non-Governmental Organizations ( **NGOs** ) are involved . A case has already been filed against 33 NGO members - **including Germans, Swiss, French, Bulgarians, Spaniards, Austrians and Norwegians.**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\- an **Iranian** and a **Pakistani** .  
  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the police, **the circuit started its activity last June** and for the time being and it is estimated that at least 32 times that it organized routes of hope in Greece, more than 3,000 immigrants and refugees passed through our country.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The circuit used closed groups and applications on the internet to share information about where the boats would leave and arrive, providing information and even details about [**the Moria HVAC**](https://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/1046762/fotia-sti-moria-profulakistikan-oi-exi-afganoi-pou-katigoroudai-gia-ton-ebrismo/) .  
  
&gt;  
&gt;What the police are looking for now is the turnover of the circuit.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**The announcement of ELAS is as follows:**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*After many months of investigation by the Mytilene Security Sub-Directorate, the action of an organized circuit was identified, which was systematically active in facilitating the illegal entry of foreigners into the Greek territory, through the island of Lesvos.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*The investigation was carried out in collaboration with the National Intelligence Service (E.Y.P.) and the assistance of the Counter-Terrorism Service (D.A.E.E.B) as well as the Directorates of Management and Analysis of Information (DI.DA. P.), Foreigners of Attica and Criminological Investigations (D.E.E.).*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Information Collection and Management Department of the General Assembly also participated.* *Π.Α.Δ.* *North Aegean, the Department of Migration Management of Lesvos, the 9th Regional Administration of the Coast Guard and the Central Port Authority of Mytilene.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*A criminal case was filed for the case - for the - where appropriate - offenses of forming and joining a criminal organization, espionage, violation of state secrets, as well as violations of the Immigration Code.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*According to the research data, the organized circuit involves a total of (35) foreigners and a specific (33) members of four Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), which are active in immigration issues, as well as (2) third-country nationals.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*Chronologically, the action of the organized circuit is determined at least from the beginning of last June, in the form of providing substantial assistance to organized circuits of illegal trafficking of migrants.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*As for their methodology of action (modus operandi), those involved, under the pretext of humanitarian action, provided to refugee flows from Turkey, through closed groups and internet applications, information and confidential information, such as:*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*· The gathering places on the Turkish coast and the time of departure of specific refugee flows to the island of Lesvos;*  
*· the coordinates (longitude and latitude) of specific refugee flows and their direction in a specific time and place;*  
*· the number of foreign nationals boarding third countries in boats, as well as the prevailing situation during the voyage of the boats,*  
*· their final destination (landing area),*  
*· details of the accommodation in K.Y.T.* *in Moria of Lesvos.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*In addition, through the extensive use of a specific application of telephone connections, which is related to the activation of rescue operations, they hindered the operational work of the vessels of the Hellenic Coast Guard, during the time when migratory flows were evolving.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*From the data of the research so far, it appears that the organized circuit facilitated - with the methodology mentioned above - the movement to the island of Lesvos of a large number of third country nationals, in at least (32) cases (completed and attempted).*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*An investigation is under way to determine the full extent of the criminal organization's illegal activity and its links.*",,/r/europe/comments/j18dv4/immigrant_they_found_a_multinational_slave_trade/g6xotuu/,free_thinker001,1601282373

1348,"&gt; When Armenians in artsakh voted to seceede to Armenia BEFORE conflict started. THEY WEREN'T OPPRESSED.

How can you talk in such a confident manner about things you don't know? 

If Armenians weren't opressed how can you explain this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shusha_massacre

Or the fact that Armenians went from 90%+ of the population to 75%. 
Or the dozens of petitions sent to Moscow during the USSR complaining about mistreatment of Armenians? 

&gt;In 1964 a long petition, similar in nature to the previous one and signed by 2,500
N-K Armenians, was sent to Khrushchev. The petition, which solemnly brought
the problem into the open, explained Azerbaijan’s ‘chauvinistic, pan-Turkic
policy’ that aimed to expel the Armenians out from their ‘ancestral homeland’. The
petition also detailed Azebaijani attempts to keep the region under-developed and
asked Khrushchev to unify N-K with Armenia.88 Similarly, in 1965 a group of 13
Armenian intellectuals, artists and professionals petitioned the highest authorities
in the CP of the USSR including Brezhnev, Head of the Presidium of the CC of
the USSR, Aleksei Kosygin, Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, and
Anastas Mikoyan, Chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium, to consider
the Armenian grievances and attach N-K to Armenia.89 However, all these requests
fell on deaf ears.
This petition, known as the ‘letter of the 13’, represented one of the most
important turning points in the history of the struggle of the N-K Armenians. A
total of 45,000 Armenians signed the letter, among them Bakrat Ulubabian, one
of the nationalist leaders of N-K if not the mastermind behind the campaign in
the 1960s.90 Most of the issues raised in the letter became the blueprint for the
Karabakh nationalist movement in the late 1980s. The second half of the 1960s
was the period in which the NUP was created in Yerevan. Despite the small
number of people involved in radical protests, the N-K agenda raised the fury of
the Armenians and sought their support.

There was a Forsa [survey on 11.09](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Mehrheit-fuer-Aufnahme-von-Fluechtlingen-article22029015.html)., and only 15% were against taking in any refugees and even 50% were for taking in refugees regardless if there's an european solution or not.

Just look at the eastern Europe right after the fall of the Soviet union and the mafia wars in the 90's. 

 I were born right after the collapse of the Soviet union in the 90's, when our government/police was so poor and underfunded (average monthly wage was 50 EEK which is equivalent to 3.1 euros) that they didn't have the resources to fight against mafia. Mafia killings, car bombs, gas station and other armed robberies were common. Last mafia shootings and murder in public that i remember happened in 2006 and 2018. Last carbomb that I remember was around the year 2000. All because the police became enough funded and learned to fight against organized crime/mafia parties.

This is what having a police force fighting against mafias means and that they literally exist to protect ordinary people, at least in countries that don't value corruption and authoritarianism.

1369,"&gt;People are rational beings and will naturally choose the most appropriate mode of transportation given the circumstances

I'm fairly certain people will choose the most convenient/comfortable option available, not necessarily the most appropriate one. As you said, cars are incredibly versatile; if you have the option to use one (and its use is actually warranted, obviously), you probably will. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Yet the number of cars on the road still increased 10 times. How do you explain that? 

Your GDP is about 10 times higher as well. More money, more cars. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If you want to make people stop using cars 

I don't have anything against cars, all I did was point out that more lanes ≠ less congestion. There is an upper and lower limit to that, as pointed out in the article, but it's true for most (free) roads. [Here's](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-06/traffic-jam-blame-induced-demand) another (better) article on the subject; it mostly disagrees with everything you said, but I'd say it's worth a read regardless.

""Islamophobia"" and ""Turkophobia"" are just pseudoscience buzzwords, trying to put the blame for poor relations on other people, so that Turks can avoid having to have a long hard look at the real reasons for the way people behave when the topic of Turkey, and sometimes even just of Turks, comes up. 

If you mean racism, then just say it. There are racists everywhere, and feel free to report actual racism because it is against the rules, but I doubt that they make up more than a minority even in this sub. We can find this event entertaining without being motivated by racism, there are a lot of other reasons to dislike the Turkish government.

It seems to me more like people in this thread are joking about both Turkey and KSA, and the situation. You may not like being the butt of the joke, but you should learn to take a joke and realise when people aren't actually serious, it's not healthy to be unable to recognise and/or take a joke. People make jokes about pretty much everything, it doesn't mean that they are serious.

For a serious non-joke answer about KSA over Turkey? Many people are short-sighted, KSA is a more distant threat to Europeans and KSA actually tries to hide their threats. I agree that KSA are worse, but that doesn't make your extremists nice people. Turkey does the opposite of KSA, less actual violence (though gunboat diplomacy is a violent threat) but more political interference by Turks in our countries, and your government emphasizes its threats a lot so people hear about Turkey's misbehaviour more often, and from your own government too. People who don't care much about what is going on see a very misrepresentative picture of actual events, and not everyone has the spare time to find out more.",,/r/europe/comments/j0vh5u/saudi_arabia_officially_bans_turkish_products/g6xcpi7/,FCPTAN,1601270007

&gt;The Swiss said no by a large majority to a limitation of immigration of EU nationals, to the great relief of the business community, and voted in favor of a two-week paternity leave when young fathers were previously only entitled to a day or two.

&gt;Voters rejected by 61.7 per cent the popular initiative of the populist right-wing UDC, the country's largest party, which denounces ""uncontrolled and excessive immigration"" and considers jobs threatened by the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (ALCP) signed in 1999 with the European Union (EU). This result is all the more telling since the participation rate was very high at around 59%.

If you lived in the US and actually took the time to educate yourself, you would know that while many people are exercising their rights to protest in a peaceful manner, there are thousands of thugs and criminals wreaking havoc on the streets here for no reason other than to destroy property and assault innocent people. I encourage you to read the actually facts of the Brianna Taylor case for instance. The police announced themselves but Brian has boyfriend opened fire on them first. During their legitimate right to return fire to protect their own lives, Taylor was unfortunately hit and killed in the crossfire. Rightfully so, neither of these cops were charged as they have the right to protect themselves when fired upon. These are all indisputable facts, as proven through eyewitness testimony in the grand jury.  The 3rd cop was charged for firing supposedly blindly through another apartment. However, many believe that he was overcharged to appease the psychos on the street.

Yet, when news of these legitimate facts were released the mobs of thugs across the US used it as yet another excuse to destroy property and attempt to murder or injure police or anyone else they perceive as being against them.

I have no problem to argument pro Nuclear, but atleast use arguments and don't start shit talking. I could made a want page article how shitty Hinkely Point C is.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the unsincere parts.

Germany doesn't have the highest Elecricity prices, as that is a too broad term.

Going by price from generation Germany has one of the lowest prices. 

Yes consumer electricity prices are quite high, due to levies and taxes.  But if they do it like other countries and subsidize electricity through other means, it will be cheaper, which is also being planned, as the EEG will be partly paid by the CO2 tax. Also 50% of our Consumer are freed from Levies and Taxes as they are the energy intensive Industry and there is a reason that Germany has quite a lot of them.

The other graphic from the link of the article:

[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Electricity\_prices\_for\_non-household\_consumers,\_second\_half\_2019\_(EUR\_per\_kWh).png](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Electricity_prices_for_non-household_consumers,_second_half_2019_(EUR_per_kWh).png)

&amp;#x200B;

Than this unsourced masterpiece:

&gt;Berlin was even forced to restart some of its coal power plants to  compensate for slumps in energy production caused by the inherent  intermittency of wind and solar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Germany installed capacity. This side has also generation which tells the same story.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://energy-charts.info/charts/installed\_power/chart.htm?l=de&amp;c=DE&amp;stacking=sorted&amp;expansion=installed\_power&amp;sum=0&amp;partsum=0](https://energy-charts.info/charts/installed_power/chart.htm?l=de&amp;c=DE&amp;stacking=sorted&amp;expansion=installed_power&amp;sum=0&amp;partsum=0)

&amp;#x200B;

The only spike in added Coal capacity was in 2015, where new powerplants came online that were planned before the second nuclear exit, three of them. 

Those plant are probably running great.

[https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vattenfall-wants-shut-down-large-coal-power-station-hamburg](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/vattenfall-wants-shut-down-large-coal-power-station-hamburg)

&amp;#x200B;

Seems not. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also to downplay known facts is also an issue, everybody power generation has pro and cons.

And for nuclear the biggest con is cost, especially time and cost overruns are a well known problem. Happened with the majority of Nuclear reactors constructed in China and they build a lot of them. 

The European ones being built are even more abmyssal in that regard.

Building new nuclear is from an economic perspective worse than any form of Electricity production. While they are good in low CO2 emissions, but that are renewables also. 

MIT made a nice report how to lower the cost of Nuclear Energy, but they even acknowledge is currently the most expensive form and the methods for reducing cost are quite difficult to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

Profileration and Nuclear waste are also issues, especially politically. Peak Uranium is also an interesting discussion.  Those need to be atleast mention.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be about argueing about Renewables, without storage. Better Land use is also an interesting topic regarding renewables. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also it's about Nuclear funding for Nuclear from the EU. Countries can continue to build them.

Also the  countries not wanting nuclear funding on EU level is far larger than Germany.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/j0rlpv/europes_division_over_nuclear_power_is_hurting/g6waloi/,Salix166,1601246645

The CMA-platform is assembled in the same plant where the Volvo XC40 is assembled because thats the only Volvo built on the CMA-platform thus its assembled in Belgium and China but its not actually built there in the same plant. The Chinese plant in Taizhou altough most likely has their Chinese plant making theirs, the plant in Zhangjiakou but the plant in Belgium most likely has the Swedish plant in Skövde as a supplier, these are the only Volvo plants that make all their engines after all. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The huge difference is said companies own their own IP and guard it  where as the Volvo / Polestar IP is owned by Geely to use as they wish. 

They cant do whatever they want with Volvo Cars (without consequence), the brand is co-owned by Volvo AB and they could potentially force them to stop using the Volvo brand for their cars if they say merge with Geely which is Geely's plan at the moment. It'll be Saab Automobiles all over again, where NEVS who had bought up Saab Automobiles lost the right to actually use the brand Saab because Saab Group who owned the brand just said no now.

&gt; The other companies you mentioned such as Samsung, Apple and Sony are not owned by (subsidiaries) of Chinese companies. 

Okay then lets take this example. Microsoft an American company recently bought Zenimax Media for 7,5 billion USD, you might have heard of it this last week or not its big news in the gaming community anyway. Zenimax media which was already american actually is now owned by Microsoft, but they also own everything zenimax used to own now like the studio Machinegames that recently rebooted the Wolfenstein series. This studio is entirely in Sweden, it does not exist anywhere else in the world, only operates in Sweden. *Is the studio now american just because the owner of the studio is american even though it's situated in Uppsala, Sweden and literally does not exist anywhere else?* 

Or another one, DICE another Swedish Studio owned by EA an American company. Now from what I can find DICE has three studios, one in Stockholm and one in Guildford in England and one in L.A. in the US. Is DICE Swedish or not? Are their games Swedish or not? Is it American because their owner is? What do you say? 

Most people will say DICE is Swedish and their games like Battlefield are also Swedish even though they are owned by an American company and has studios outside Sweden, no one has a problem calling DICE Swedish tho but as fast as you mention Volvo Cars or Polestar they're Chinese when both of them are situated in Sweden, registered as Swedish companies, pay Swedish corporate taxes and have their headquarters here and so on.

&gt; In any case i do not understand the commotion from your end, the only  point of this entire thread was that the Polestar 2 is made in China  which it is ...

But also just so it is clear, the last thing Armenia wants is to involve Russia, because it could spell the end for Nagorno Karabakh's effective independence as Russia would put boots on the ground in the name of peace keepers - FYI the Russian proposed peace plan includes only Russian peacekeepers, and this has been adamantly rejected by the Armenians. They don't want to go back to the USSR 2.0.

In an attempt to provide an opinion to your question, I don't think it would concern NATO, as the latter is defensive. If Turkey's acts are considered to be belligerent (despite it purportedly being due to a defense pact) then it cannot trigger NATO for defense.

2110,"&gt; Else we would simply lay back and do nothing. This discourse absolutely does occur also, we can see how much societies view of homosexuality, trans people, ect. has changed over just only 10-20 years or so as proof of the changing theories.

Well, societies change, people change, politics change. I'm saying ""maybe we should debate about it"", I'm also saying ""I don't think BDSM is the n°1 issue of mankind today"".

&gt; The problem precisely with this is when someone comes along and says; ""No, your arbitrary judgement actively hurts me and so I must fight it."" 

Which happens literally every day in every parliament on the planet. Black lives matter hurts suprematists. Gay people hurt homophobic people. Liberal economic policies hurts social workers, and social workers hurt finances. So what, are we gonna ban everything that hurts anyone and build a teddy bear heaven ?

&gt; Take the (not as rare as you think) cases of odd sexualities where they insist on serious physical ""harm"" being done to them;

Which, if everybody consent to it, is done in private, all participants agree, so no victim, so no issue, and nobody ever cares cause nobody ever knows about what's going on there.

On the other hand, if you get your arm chopped off, chances are, you're gonna need a doctor. Then, you might get invalid for your job. Then, you might need some help in every day life, or, a prosthetic arm. So it's not like ""it's private and consequence free so nobody has to know"", cause it isn't. And the thing with kinky sex is the same : if it's consequence free, nobody cares. If it has consequences, then there are reasons for the community to actually care cause that's the community who's gonna fund your necessary health care...

&gt; I dont think you can shoulder this over onto doctors either; a suicidal person may desperately want to die, but be too afraid to do it, so asks a friend or family member to do it for them; is this assisted suicide or murder?

Murder. Assisted suicide is a medical procedure. And yes, medical stuff should be decided by doctors. Not by politicians, not by citizens, but by specialists who know what they're doing.

&gt; As you say, someone cannot consent to give their life away because that would also be giving up their ability to consent; does this not also apply to other permanent features, such as ""consentual"" mutilation, or phrased differently, surgery?

So where do we draw the line in there ? Genital stuff is not okay but fake boobs are ? How about people cutting half their stomach to weight less ? And piercing, do we allow them ? What about tatoos ? At some point you draw an arbitrary line which is ""society is okay with stuff up to there and after that it isn't"", and it's not a scientific line, it's a political one, and politics are so complex they might as well be arbitrary.

&gt; But yeah just overall, whilst the line we draw may have to be arbitrary, I dont think we can just leave it at that and must constantly find a way to produce a proper theory behind why the line should be there or elsewhere.

But if you wanted such a theory, you'll have to analyse why a specific population thinks in this specific ways : basically, go ahead, take a country, any country, and learn about its entire history, its demographic, its sociology, its culture, its political organisation, the history of its major religious groups and major ideologies and so on. Spend a decade understanding them, and then at the end of it you'll have an understanding of ""why do these people think the way they do"". 

That's how you find books telling you that around Paris the peasants' traditional family structure was an ""equal"" / ""community"" kind of structure (meaning that heritage was split evenly between brothers and children stayed a long time in the family) which leads to extreme left ideas because ""community &gt; individuals =&gt; egalitarism"" and ""all brothers are equal =&gt; all man equals =&gt; universalism"" which is the reason why France had so much communist during the 20th century and has communist public services, which can be put in parallel which Russia who shared the same traditional peasant family and also went communist. And that's just the first example that came to me.

Why do people believe that sex has to be painful to be fun ? Well let's take a country, analyse its culture and history and finds all of the nuggets of knowledge that lead us to this conclusion and then we can be like ""okay how do we change this"". That's how it would work if you wanted a ""proper theory"" but most people don't. They don't care about the 600 pages book that goes 300 years back to explain why BDSM is popular in this specific country at that specific time, they're happy with ""BDSM is popular end of the story"" because at the end of the day there are hundreds if not thousand of different political topics that could justify this kind of debate and we don't have time to read 600 pages book for each and every one of them.

Politics is arbitrary. Even in something that's supposed to be scientific like the economy you find stuff like the debt limit that is imposed to country which came from a literal ""that number will sound great"" moment and has zero scientific justification. And it's okay because these random arbitrary stuff come from elected people debating about what feels good and that's good enough for 99% of things.

2325,"

Bit of a history. De jrure till 1918 Artsakh wasn't part of any country.

When First Republic of Armenia was being formed due to pressure from Ottoman Empire many regions that had majority armenian regions were not included in newly formed Armenia. Some: Artsakh, Zangezur, Nakhchivan were basically gifted to Azerbaijan.
Then The Soviet Union came and both Armenia and Azerbaijan were part of it. Armenia got a bit more land that had majority armenian residents but the three mentioned above were still part of Azerbaijan.

In 1988 Azerbaijan starts a war spreading a whole length of Armenian Azerbaijani border, but mainly in Artsakh in means to kill to drive Armenians away. So it is still going to this day.

 Although there is technically seasefire that both parties shoot at each other from time to time but mainly from Azerbaijan as they have more resentment towards armenians generally. As an expample in Hungary Azerbaijani officer kills sleeping Armenian officer with an axe and was going to kill another officer but hid in other officers(not armenian) room. He was sentences till death in Hungary but then they gave him to Azerbaijan and he was let go as soon as he got there, given home, money raised in military ranking.
So any aggression towards Armenia is highly praised in Azerbaijan.

This is not simply a case of land. It is hate towards the whole nation.

Earlier this year, when there were rising tensions in Armenia's northern border with Azerbaijan, there was even a threat from Azerbaijani politics that they are going to blow up Metsamor nuclear power plant, which will not only affect Armenia neighboring countries including Azerbaijan.",,/r/europe/comments/j0pefp/nagornokarabakh_events_megathread/g6ub7s9/,Fallen_Ruby,1601210223

&gt;*""The dangerous actions of Armenia risks to further destabilize the region, which has strategic importance for Azerbaijan and Europe, as it provides energy and transport links to Georgia, Turkey, and Europe for the Azerbaijani oil and gas as well as other export commodities,"" Wilson wrote. ""By jeopardizing major infrastructure projects, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline, Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, Armenia could put European energy and transport security at huge risk.""*

There is no mention of Armenia in the whole text.

There is no mention for any withdrawal of any forces from Nagorno Karabakh.

There is no mention for any withdrawal by Armenia from anywhere.

The resolution in its preamble refers to the UN Security Council resolutions which further:

 - do NOT recognise Armenia having invaded or occupied any territories, 

 - do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as invaded,

 - do NOT call on any forces to withdraw from Nagorno Karabakh,

 - do NOT call on Armenia to withdraw any forces from anywhere. 

https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm

This Azerbaijani-drafted resolution was voted against by the UN Security Council permanent members co-chairing the OSCE group tasked to settle this conflict, US, France and Russia, because of its formulation of the final status of Nagorno Karabakh. The final status of Nagorno Karabakh is to be decided through the UN-mandated OSCE group:

&gt; The proposal transmitted to the sides in Madrid comprises a balanced package of principles that are currently under negotiation. The sides have agreed that no single element is agreed until all elements are agreed by the parties.

&gt; Unfortunately, this draft resolution selectively propagates only certain of these principles to the exclusion of others, without considering the Co-Chairs' proposal in its balanced entirety.

&gt; Because of this selective approach, the three OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries must oppose this unilateral draft resolution. They reiterate that a peaceful, equitable, and lasting settlement of the NK conflict will require unavoidable compromises among the parties that reflect the principles of territorial integrity, non-use of force, and equal rights of peoples, as well as other principles of international law.

be blacklisted? IMO those seem pretty extreme stances, too.

Instead of singling out capitalism, democracy, etc., they should've just left it at blacklisting organizations with extreme stances. Or preferably, they should've just demanded that study material is obtained from neutral and unbiased sources.

2467," Armenia has sided with Russia over Crimea

In a statement on March 19th the president, Serzh Sargsyan, essentially recognised Russia's annexation of Crimea.

**Analysis**

The government maintained a neutral policy regarding the crisis in Ukraine until the March 16th referendum in Crimea, which was swiftly followed by the annexation of the territory by Russia. Mr Sargsyan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, discussed the outcome of the vote, which has been condemned as illegal by much of the international community. Mr Sargsyan was quoted by his press office as calling it ""yet another example of the realisation of peoples' right to self-determination through a free expression of will"".

Armenia has championed the principle of self-determination in its unresolved dispute with Azerbaijan over Nagorny Karabakh. It may be hoping that the Crimea precedent will give another boost to the cause of continued Armenian control over the disputed territory, which is formally part of Azerbaijan. Mr Sargsyan's stance on Crimea is also a logical continuation of his decision last August, widely attributed to Russian pressure, to ditch an association agreement with the EU and make Armenia part of the Russian-led Customs Union. Mr Sargsyan is not only mindful of his country's heavy dependence on Russia for energy and security, but is also keen to forestall any Russian support for Armenia's four main opposition parties, which have recently agreed to join forces.

Whatever Mr Sargsyan's motives, the announcement has already caused serious damage to Armenia's relationship with Ukraine. The interim Ukrainian government recalled its ambassador and demanded an official explanation from Armenia on March 21st. The US ambassador to Armenia, John Heffern, described Mr Sargsyan's statement on Crimea as ""very unfortunate"".

Mr Sargsyan's move may have ended any possibility of the EU and Armenia signing an association agreement (excluding a free-trade deal, which is off the table following Armenia's decision to join the Customs Union). The Armenian prime minister, Tigran Sargsyan, indicated his government's readiness to conclude such an agreement during a visit to Brussels on March 20th. Sweden's foreign minister, Carl Bildt, said on March 23rd that the EU could not do the same for Armenia because the country had placed itself ""in a different league"" with its endorsement of the Crimea referendum.

More than 700,000 jobs would be at risk for EU companies exporting to Britain if the UK and Brussels fail to agree a trade deal this year, according to a leading German economic research institute.  

In total, including companies outside the EU that export to the UK, there would be 1m potential job losses in a no-deal Brexit scenario, according to an unpublished report by the Halle Institute for Economic Research seen by the Financial Times.  

The research, updating an initial report from February 2019, is still being peer reviewed and is due to be published in the coming weeks.  

The scale of the job losses estimated by the research underline how much is at stake for both sides in the negotiations between London and Brussels, which are showing few signs of progress with time running out to sign a trade deal.  

While the UK left the EU at the end of January 2020, it remains in the bloc’s customs union and single market until the end of this year. Unless a trade deal is agreed, customs checks and tariffs are expected to be introduced on trade between the EU and the UK next year.  

Germany would suffer the biggest hit, the research said, predicting that in a no-deal Brexit Europe’s largest economy would have more than 176,000 potential job losses at companies exporting to the UK and their suppliers. France could lose over 80,000 jobs, Poland 78,000 and Italy 72,000.  


Outside the EU, China would be most affected with almost 91,000 jobs at stake. In the UK, almost 22,000 jobs could go at businesses supplying EU companies exporting to Britain.  

Smaller countries would suffer a bigger hit in relation to the size of their labour market, it said, with Ireland forecast to lose over 35,000 jobs — almost 2 per cent of its workforce. Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Belgium and Malta could lose between 0.5 and 3.4 per cent of their total jobs.  

Oliver Holtemöller, vice-president of the Halle Institute, told the FT that the impact from lower imports to the UK would be offset “only to a very limited extent and with some delay” by the opportunity created by reduced exports from Britain to the EU.  

“It is possible that some firms take over some intra-EU market share of UK firms,” said Mr Holtemöller, who is also an economics professor at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. “However, this is very difficult to quantify ex-ante.”  

He said the full number of estimated job losses may not materialise as “firms do also have other options to react”.  

The UK imported €319bn of goods and services from the EU last year — more than from all other countries combined — although its share of total exports from the bloc has fallen from 17 per cent to 15 per cent since the 2016 Brexit referendum.   


The Halle Institute assumed trade between the UK and EU would follow World Trade Organization rules after Brexit. This means UK imports of EU cars and car parts would have a 10 per cent tariff, while agricultural tariffs would be higher. Non-tariff costs, such as customs delays and paperwork, would also rise sharply for companies importing into the UK.  

The flow of EU goods and services into Britain would fall 41 per cent if there was a no-deal Brexit, it said, which would wipe 0.25 percentage points off the gross output of the 27-country bloc.  

It predicted the car industry would be the hardest hit, affecting exporters in Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic, Belgium and Slovakia in particular. But agricultural exporters in Bulgaria would also be disrupted, as would French and Dutch wholesale trade exporters.  

The Halle Institute stressed that it had only examined the “partial effects of a negative trade shock”. It added: “We do not consider macroeconomic general equilibrium effects. We do not aim to estimate the total effects of Brexit on employment in the UK or in any other country.”  

The research backs up the findings of a London School of Economics report published last week, which said 40 per cent of agricultural and food products consumed by UK households were imported from the EU. The report, sponsored by Denmark's Arla Foods, predicted this would fall 63 per cent in a no-deal Brexit.  

“Under a no-deal scenario a number of product lines including yoghurt, buttermilk, dairy spreads, milk and cream are likely to cease being imported into the UK from the EU,” the LSE report said, predicting a 26.5 per cent average price increase for branded and speciality food products imported to the UK from the EU under a no-deal Brexit.",,/r/europe/comments/j0oy0v/eu_companies_warned_of_700000_job_losses_in/g6tudm0/,MushroomAway1003,1601203535

2502,"&gt; Portugal ja nem para ferias me agrada

A mim incomoda-me que tenham investido tanto na visibilidade turística. Em grande parte é o turismo que faz com que as rendas subam: os senhorios fazem mais facilmente dinheiro a colocar quartos/casas no airbnb onde podem cobrar preços de estadia mais altos. A oferta de alojamento faz aumentar a procura no mercado. Como o número de casas não aumenta de forma proporcional ao aumento da procura, isso faz com que haja uma quebra da oferta em arrendamentos de longo prazo, acabando por incentivar outros senhorios a aumentarem as rendas porque os consumidores estão dispostos a pagar mais para conseguirem o alojamento/arrendamento.

E como é de prever, a mão de obra que sustenta o turismo não precisa de ser altamente qualificada, logo claro que os salários não aumentam.

I think its not very likely. He may be the eternal hope of the right wing of the party. But I feel he can't up his game to do what it needs to become chancellor. Whenever he opens his mouth, he has those dated CDU positions from the 1980ies, a party environment that is gone by now. His weak public appearances already cost him the party leadership. I think he had good chances to win this, as Kramp-Karrenbauer was not a very strong candidate, but he totally botched it by poor presentation. 

Also it hurts him especially now, during the crisis, that he famously parted with Merkel and also didn't look out for any offices within the party or his state. All his rivals are very present during the crisis, holding important positions, while he is relegated to the visitor bench.

If this is so common even in the most STEM of STEM fields, imagine the fuckery that is going on in the humanities. Now, admittedly, they did develop [methods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) to keep this in check, but - and I want to stay diplomatic - I think with questionable results.

EDIT: Also, I'm not talking about the claim ""everything is propaganda"" since that was a strawman. The person you replied to didn't make that claim (at least the comment you responded to didn't contain any such claim). The actual position was: Be aware of what propaganda is. Don't just condemn it, take it for what it is. Make up your own mind.

2657,"The reason for the long thin strips either has to to with transport to the main road in the village or with peat extraction which causes land to be cultivated in long strips. (or both)

As for the color pattern, these strips were owned by many farmers, but as time went on the ownership transfered from one to another. Maybe you married into new land, or bought it, or maybe your uncle died. The issue is that you dont get to choose what land you own. If you are a wheat farmer you might own 4 strips in 4 totally different places. This makes for interesting color combinations. Not to be confused with stripfarming, which has to to with crop rotation and soil erosion, rather than ownership.

Communists believed in big collective farms owned by the state. Look also at modern socialists like Mansholt who promoted european megafarms.

Farmland in the Netherlands used to look a lot like this, until the government promoted private land consolidation for infrastructure and agricultural efficiency. And yes, it did help efficiency by a ton, and it's extremely helpful for water management. It makes me wonder if their communist history is making Polish farmers extra weary of going trough a similar process. Dutch farmers were also weary of it, and they didn't even suffer under communism.

America is huge, and there isn't a need to cultivate the few boglands you have for wheat and vegtables. I don't know too much about american agriculture but I'm pretty sure you do grow cranberries in some of your boglands/peatlands. You probably used to have some farms that look like this for other reasons but there probably aren't a lot of them left.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/j0288x/sułoszowa_poland/g6sw5ht/,PizzaOnTheBBQ,1601189568

2738,In Albania and Kosovo you used to not be able to marry within your own village since that was your relatives Albanians from small villages or cities still follow this. When I was going to get married my husbands family sat down with my family to make sure none of our ancestors were related they went back almost 200 years found out that my great aunt married his great uncle but we are not related at all and since they didn’t have kids we have no common relatives. In Albania or Kosovo you can not marry any relative including 3rd cousins which is legal in the US.

2759,"Going off photos from the old dial to the new dial the inner workings are likely the same mechanism or similar in design. You don't tend to make a new design so that makes sense. The dials are all in the same positions at least which indicates this. I wander what it originally looked like in the 1400's, obviously there are no pictures and the parts they have in the city museum are from the face from the late 1800's. At the time they probably thought it would have made a good opportunity to redesign the face, at least some of it survives in the city museum. I like the canvas of the old version they have in a photo on Wikipedia. From a horology point of view you are always caught in a rock and a hard place when it comes to these sorts of things, it's not a good idea to replace a whole face but it's also not really acceptable to refurbish it either because it's still not the original but you also can't let it decay. You get the same discussions in the watch community today weather or not dials should be re-painted to make them look new or should they be left as original. Same with the movements, some people are of the opinion that everything should be original even if that means they don't work properly and others thing the movements parts should be replaced to keep them working. I don't know where I stand to be honest because I understand the arguments of both. I don't agree the design of the face should have been changed though but then again I don't think it should have been damaged by a grenade but that's war.

With my personal collection I simply don't run my oldest watches and pocket watches. But with a public piece it's hard to warrant doing that I suppose. I wind mine up every now and then to see if they still work and to watch them run or not. I think if they broke down I would have them repaired though, however I would want to keep the original part for historical purposes. I don't think I would ever change the face though but who knows I might change my opinion over time.",,/r/europe/comments/j0bfnu/astronomical_clock_in_the_style_of_socialist/g6sk90j/,kuddlesworth9419,1601185112

* You and I are not members of an agrarian tribe where the vast majority of our social group are illiterate. Passing learned behaviours down by word of mouth isn't the sole way we educate our children anymore.
* Although the example above is ultimately a beneficial one, it can and does just as easily cause harmful beliefs to perpetuate. There are people in Africa *today* who believe you can cure yourself of AIDS by raping a two year old to ""cleanse"" yourself. You can't tell me that one's based on trial and error.
* The mother in the example may indeed cause harm to herself and her family by questioning things that ""everyone knows"", but without people who do that we don't have progress. If nobody challenges the old ways, those ways can never improve.

I realise the original point of debate was incest, so if we return to that for a minute - most people will say when asked that the reason incest is unethical is because it can produce offspring with genetic defects. If you then say ""OK, its a brother &amp; sister, its entirely consensual, and the brother has had a vasectomy. Is it still unethical?"" you will get a blank look.

Yes, China has given loans, like the $1bn loan for Belgrade-Budapest railway line.

But as described on your article we see this example being repeated everywhere. Why example here in Finland we declined China's funding for the Helsinki-Tallinn tunnel. 

&gt;Elsewhere in the region, Chinese loans have sent public debt soaring. In neighbouring Montenegro, a Chinese-built and financed highway has raised the country’s debt to 80 per cent of GDP.

Chinese actual investments are miniscule compared to the West. 
&gt;While the Chinese are economically active in Serbia, their investments are, in reality, mostly loans and remain clustered around several specific projects. Of the $2.2 billion that has entered Serbia from China, almost two-thirds are loans and only one-fourth, or $561 million, actual investments. Compare this to Chinese investments in the U.K., which were $8.3 billion in 2019 alone.

Just look at the Pantheon on the front page, the current building is not the original either.

It was built by Agrippa in 27BC, destroyed and restored by Domitian in 80 AD, completely destroyed in 110 AD, rebuilt by Trajan/Hadrian and restored again by Septimius Severus and Caracalla in 202 AD.

Then it got turned into a church in the 7th century, stripped of it's bronze in the 17th century and the whole attic level is a neoclassical addition from the 18th century.

2854,"People of Serbia were pretty much pro EU and pro EU values, especially like a decade ago. From then, there is a vicious cycle that is bringing the public away.

First you need to remember that we have a criminal autocrat in power, who is also intertwingled in huge corruption and mob networks. An average Serb doesn't even *have access* to anything other than what he says (they removed all opposition-supporting media from national network). So what happens is this:

1. EU sends aid, Vucic steals and misuses it together with his mafia boys
2. If the public was properly informed about the aid, they would expect some results from the money. So Vucic's media are not mentioning it too much.
3. Because most aid or loans (as well as local money) are being misused, naturally we don't have enough progress to move our negotiations further
4. To 'explain' the lack of progress in negotiations, they start telling the 'they hate us' stories. Vucic is using his mass propaganda machine media to paint a picture that we are doing great, when in reality we are worse and worse off each year with those criminals in power.
5. So the average person that doesn't have access to other information, starts resenting EU because they are fed stories that 'we are doing good but EU is hypocritical in their demands to Serbia'

This is why an uneducated or uninformed Serb grows away. However, for the more educated ones, what bugs them is that EU, with their uber-democratic values, still supports Vucic despite of him being borderline dictator.

2911,"&gt;One lone german got lost and dropped a bomb on London, then as retaliation Churchill ordered a full blown attack on a German city, forgot which one

That's completely false.

""One lone German"" didn't get lost and bomb London by mistake. The first German raid on London was on 15 August 1940 and involved an attack on Croydon that killed 60 civilians. The following day an attack on Wimbledon killed 15. There were frequent attacks on London almost every night from then on.

In July 1940 German bombing killed more than 250 British civilians, in August more than 1,000, in September more than 7,000. 

It wasn't until December 1940, by which time 20,000 British civilians had been killed, that the RAF carried out their first area attack on a German city (Mannheim).

In fact the Luftwaffe bombed Germany before the RAF did. On 10 May 1940 3 German bombers, sent to attack Dijon in France, got lost and attacked Freiburg in German by mistake, killing 57 civilians. The Germans claimed the RAF had carried out the attack and used it to justify their own bombing.",,/r/europe/comments/j02l95/25_september_1939_was_a_black_monday_for_warsaw/g6r5psq/,WhiteSatanicMills,1601167425

2923,"&gt; Not really. There was no single international law prohibiting mass murder of undesirables, either in occupied territory or your own

Possibly not in Germany. But murdering people in occupied territory was certainly a war crime.

From Hague (IV) Laws and Customs of War on Land 1907:

&gt;The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.

I don't think mass murder counts as ""public safety"" and I don't think the Germans respected the laws in force in Poland.

&gt;Here's Hague Conventions of 1907, the last pre-WW2 edition. No word concerns the civilians in occupied \ controlled territories.

Those people are an important electorate for the CDU, SPD and the Greens - as it was visible when for a few weeks in 2017 SPD grew as strong as CDU (in the polls) and when the Greens came close (and surpassed) to the CDU last year.  I'd believe they make up for around 10, maybe 15 percent of the current CDU electorate.

By no means do I want to sound pedantic, but this is what I've studied, and It's something I try to constantly be kept up to date on. I'd advise you to read about the theories of restoration in architecture in order to better understand what I'm trying to get at.

Keeping the memory doesn't always mean to keep it the same as it used to be.

For peace amongst the large European powers? Yes.

Again I have to wonder how bad Serbian education is. The great powers of Europe were in near constant warfare for a thousand years. 63 years of peace amongst them is unprecedented.

&gt;When they joined NATO.

Okay now you're not making any sense. The EU and EEC before it were never a part of NATO.

Also how does a mutual defence treaty forfeit DEFENCE. You are aware that the only time NATO nations came together to defend a member that that member was the USA? How could member states defend the USA if they had forfeited their defence *to* the USA?

Buddy, just give up. You're a salty little Serb that's angry that mother Russia abandoned you and the rest of Yugoslavia got sick of your shit and left.

I would say, for a short trip (7 days or less), take St. Petersburg, it's smaller, easy to navigate and you can visit most of the stuff in this time. 
If you have more than one week, take Moscow, you won't get bored and there are a lot of thing to visit, especially on the Golden Ring around Moscow, and while you would spend sometime in the subway, try to visit a lot of stations cause they are wonderful. 

The main difference between the two is that St. Petersburg is more ""European style"" in the sense of visiting how was more Imperial Russia who would look a like maybe Stockholm and capitals of Northern monarchies, and Moscow would be more if you like to know more things about the Soviet Era and 20th century. 

Petersburg is more classy and delicate while Moscow is more gigantic (Both superficy and by the lot of Soviet architecture), both are very innovative cities who are very good at living with their pasts and it depends of what you are more interested at visiting about Russia.

I must admit that I always was inspired by the tales of Soviet era, Space Race and Cold War etc. so that make Moscow my favorite (While St. Petersburg is great to visit too nonetheless, go for it !)

3155,"Exactly.

Serving as a nationalistic idea of state was a conversion of function.

The State's idea was to reuse, renew, convert and bring new dignity to those buildings and structures in order to create a new state with a new sense of values and progress.

They weren't interested in restorations and archeological preservation.

That is why the word ""defacing"" is wrong IMO. We are looking at those interventions under a different light, a different sense of culture and while living in a monumentally different era.

This sort of judgment is why few people understand the motivations of most policies of that era. It is just wrong and childish to assume that our values should have been applied decades ago during periods of fragile balances.

How many times have those castles been refurbished, converted, demolished, build again and adapted BEFORE Salazar's era?

How many times Celtic Pre Roman Hillforts in the North of the Country were used, reused, demolished, adapted and burnt down until they got abandoned?

As an architect you know very well that Cathedrals were a constant ever changing building with no real end. Many of them have multiple styles and influences because they exist for centuries. Many of them were adapted and rebuilt.

But for some reason this is accepted and what the old DGEMN did completely wrong?

Obviously, i would rather see things in their natural original state. But using one of your examples, Paço dos Duques de Bragança was a ruin being pillaged  by locals for stone. This national program rebuilt it and used inspiration from other styles just like the original architects got inspired by other styles too.

The large scale ""restoration"" of our most ancient churches (like the indigenous romanic of the North) did drastically changed many of them. But those changes occurred along the previous eras too. Who knows how they really were like before?

Even to this day, we see people LOVING stone houses, stone churches, stone everything when, turns out, most relevant buildings were covered with white mortar. And yet, sense of style changed. Looking rough and old is now more valuable than renewing and converting for the present and the future. Different eras have different values.

Things are very complex. Specially that era of our history that keeps being very poorly taught in school and covered with negative predispositions stoping kids to have the right to agree or disagree with those politics while having all the information .",,/r/europe/comments/izkhq2/percentage_of_people_born_in_a_given_country/g6q35jo/,GabKoost,1601153307

And the cooperative agreements it sprang from date back further. Or were you just going to ignore those and pretend they didn't exist?

And it is the rise of the oik that has led to the  growing crisis of legitimacy in the nation states of Europe. For we are  seeing a massive expansion of the legislative burden on the people of  Europe, and a relentless assault on the only loyalties that would enable them voluntarily to bear it. The explosive effect of this has already  been felt in Holland and France. It will be felt soon everywhere, and  the result may not be what the oiks expect.

How many times do I need to repeat myself that **NO I DO NOT PAINT ALL IMMIGRANTS WITH THE SAME BRUSH** and **NO I DO NOT THINK EUROPEANS ARE PERFECT AND HAVE NO ISSUES**. There, maybe that way it actually comes through.

And where did I say to not sort out our own far right? I did not. You seriously make something into an argument where we agree! For one who complains that I supposedly paint all immigrants with the same brush, you paint me with the brush of whatever your idea is here instead of actually looking at my arguments.

The only one acting disingenuous here is you by repeatedly ignoring what I actually say, twist my words and bringing all sorts of things into it that you read in my words, but are not there. Quote me then on where I say we have no issues with the far right. Quote the part then where I say all immigrants are the same. If you can't do that, then maybe, just maybe, you are wrong on that, don't you think? We are on the same side, but you still find things to fight about for some reason.

&gt;Either we care about all the people with these backward world views, or we don't really care, at all.

I said multiple times now that we have those issues here and I am concerned about it and care about that. And that is why I don't want to add more problems on it. Let me break it down for you real easy:

Say I have a small town of 100 people. 30 of those hold those views we both find unacceptable. So we have 30% of problematic cases. Now we let in 20 new people. Of those, 15 hold problematic views. Now we have 120 people and 45 with views we deem unacceptable. That is now 37.5% of problematic cases, so things have gotten worse. While we should decrease the problematic cases, we instead increase it. And that is not good, because we then force the people who suffer from those views to fight an even harder fight or go through it again.",,/r/europe/comments/iz0j8e/why_have_we_been_taking_for_granted_that_who/g6orrzh/,cissoniuss,1601131562

3499,"&gt;You leave the UK to avoid paying British taxes, you lose citizenship. Not at all acceptable when you are making billions a year.

That's a terrible policy. Not only would it leave him stateless (assuming he only has British citizenship), which is against international law except under very specific circumstances, but it would also completely de-incentivise  him from ever keeping money in Britain. While he's changing his tax residency, he will undoubtedly still have a lot of wealth, indeed probably most of it, in the UK. That is of course good for the UK. You *want* to keep capital in your country. 

You're proposing policy based off spite. That's not a good way to govern and is actually quite childish. 

&gt;As for the precedent, it sets the precedent that if you are making x figures a year, and skip town for a tax-haven, you lose citizenship. It's not different to current policies in place.

Yes it is, revoking citizenship is a *huge* deal, and absolutely incomparable to charging higher university fees, especially considering that prior to going to university one typically does not have control over ones life and hence doesn't actively decide to be outside the UK. 

Citizenship is a cornerstone of British, and western societies, at large. It is an inalienable right which guarantees that the state will uphold basic rights and the rule of law in respect to its citizens. As soon as it starts taking it away, unless there is active damage done to the state itself (joining ISIS for example, *not* paying less tax in a totally legal manner), then you immediately set a precent of the state being able to do what it wants at the individual's expense.

What is this sovereign remedy? It is to recreate the European fabric, or as much of it as we can, and to provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, safety and freedom. We must build a kind of United States of Europe.

-

&gt; The structure of the United States of Europe will be such as to make the material strength of a single State less important.

3776,"&gt;I always thought Germany and France are constantly going for an ever closer union, and UK being a brake to that. I might be wrong

Not quite. The UK was one of the major forces pushing for closer union when it came to economics. It was the UK that drew up the regulations which brought the single market into being: Lord Cockfield wrote the paper ""Completing the Internal Market"" in 1985, listing 300 barriers to internal EU trade and proposals to remove them. The proposals were implemented in full in the single European Act of 1986.

More recently, it was the UK leading the push for completing the single market for services and capital - at present, there is really only a single market for goods and labour, 2 of the 4 freedoms. Services lags well behind, and capital even further behind. Both France and Germany have resisted those proposals pretty strongly. A free market in goods and labour serves them nicely, but opening their economies up to competition in services and capital are not in their interests.

What the UK fought against was closer *political* union.

Abstract

Public transport in rural and exurban areas faces major challenges, with low population densities making it difficult to provide high-quality, high-occupancy services. While demand-responsive transport is sometimes prescribed as an innovative strategy for service provision, the network planning approach to public transport suggests that integrated timed-transfer or pulse timetable networks should be explored first. This paper examines the rural network approach using examples from Switzerland, which has among the highest rates of public transport use in Western Europe, as well as nationally-coordinated Taktfahrplan scheduling that extends deep into rural areas. The basic Swiss pulse timetabling technique is reviewed, along with the application of the approach to a remote rural case study in Graubünden’s Lower Engadine and Val Müstair. Characteristics of pulse timetable networks and the wider rural network approach are considered, drawing broad lessons for their potential application elsewhere.",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/izkhq2/percentage_of_people_born_in_a_given_country/g6nbidz/,graudesch,1601110489
3788,"Back in the days (for a few centuries since middle ages) in most of Europe east of Rhine river there were three types of villages. This one is a linear settlement (pol. ulicówka - from the word ""ulica"" meaning street). In this type of settlement huoses are placed along the street. It may be even over 10 kilometers long, but mostly it's around 2-3 km. The second type was similar, but is for settlements in mountain areas where there can't be just a straight street. It's called łańcuchówka in Polish (from ""łańcuch"" meaning chain) and from what I learned in English it's called with a German word Waldhufendorf. The last of the most common types is a roundling (pol. okolnica - from ""koło"" meaning circle). Houses are placed circurarly around a village green (very often with the church in the center).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/j0288x/sułoszowa_poland/g6nbiud/,yeahimszymi,1601110494

Switzerland has higher numbers of people living in apartments because the majority of the Swiss population is concentrated into the largest cities.

Even your bus station proves my point - the majority of houses in that city are not within walking distance from any of the bus stations. Public transport in the US is exactly the same way - it exists, you can point to buses on the road and say ""See? There is public transport!""

3932,"Portugal urbanism destroyed the country side. Not the cities.

Specially in the North and Western regions of Portugal, villages and valleys have been ravaged by idiocy and corruption. The urban dispersion that this has created is massive problem that will render public transportation impossible and ineffective.

What forests are that good? You have a couple of biologically rich forests in very small pocket areas. No wildlife can be healthy like that. In fact, there is no large mature real forest in Portugal. 

To have the highest solar exposure in Europe (in some areas) is NOT POSITIVE. It's extremely negative for several reasons ranging from the growing scarcity of fresh water in some regions and endless wild fires.

Salazar's Dictatorship was HEAVILY relying in religion. Salazar was a religious academic and had those values as a paradigm what should be Portuguese society. It's pretty evident that when i accuse the dictatorship for our conservative past, i am also talking about religion. 

I also think you have a completely mistaken idea of Salazar's political philosophy. Which is normal as it si forbidden to teach this period of our story correctly. 

The interventions on Portuguese patrimony don't fall from the sky for no reason. For decades and centuries castles and churches were abandoned and left falling in ruins by consecutive and endless monarchs and republicans more interested in parading themselves across European courts than developing their country.

Salazar was conservative and felt the need to rebuild many of those structures as they were essential for our memory, pride and even social functions. Many of those buildings were being rebuilt TO BE USED and not as ARCHEOLOGICAL - MUSEUM references.

People do not understand that. Every building is transformed and changed as they cross eras and are used by different people. Wanting to judge Salazar because he was rebuilding patrimony and monuments to serve a purpose and not to keep them stagnated as a memory of the past may makes sense today but surely did not at the time.

The fact that we all had to leave the country (personally or several members of the family) tells a lot about how unique we are indeed. We are the only ones that have to do it despite being part of Western Europe.

I was born abroad. I live here now. I will maybe have to leave one day. I have traveled around Europe. 

We WERE unique because of the distinctive positive assets  (not everything was bad) on our lingering conservative minds. But people 30 and under, young millennials and Gen Z are not special. They are a globalized generation who not only mostly ignore what it was to be Portuguese but also refute and run away of everything that made us distinct.

This being said, we are small and we do not have special beauty. We have beautiful areas like any other nation. And our best asset, being a people with clear differing identity until the 00s, is GONE.

If it was on final approach, I'm assuming that it was lined up with the runway.  The only highway about that distance from the airfield is the E40 to the north -- the south only has a railway -- which is almost exactly 2km away, so I'm assuming that this is about where it hit.  It looks like there's a small wooded area adjoining the highway there that looks plausibly like the area in the video clips online (though it's at night, so hard to be certain).

4010," He executed in two During the trial for the murder of her son, M. Kaziukaitytė claimed to journalists that she had also become a victim of a brutal cohabitant. However, the woman kept quiet that she herself was harassing her son, who was called ""patchy"" at home, ""small toad"", in other derogatory words, and two months before her son's death covered G. Kontenis, whose violence the boy had told the kindergarten teachers. Officials found that on the day of the execution, together with G. Kontenis, she hit at least 135 blows on the child due to incorrect numbers - the boy was beaten with his fists, a belt, a phone charger, and his head was knocked on the bathroom wall. The killer couple was intoxicated with drugs. Kaunas prosecutor Vytautas sealeckas was stunned by his mother's behavior - after buying medicines for his ailing son, she browsed dating portals for half an hour, trying to make friends with men: ""It's incomprehensible with common sense."" The child disappeared after two days in Kaunas clinics, and G. Kontenis and M. Kaziukaityte were sentenced to 19 and 16 years in prison, respectively. Imprisoned M. Kaziukaitytė secretly married another famous criminal, 40-year-old recidivist Nerijus Kalaušis, who, blinded by jealousy, stabbed journalist Viltė Stankutė-Butkienė and her friend Giedrius Pavasaris. In Lukiškės Prison, a 25-year-old from Kėdainiai married not as Kaziukaitytė, but as Abromaitienė, as she recently took the surname of her ex-spouse and murdered son, Father Artūras Abromaitis.

Last I visited a few years ago, The subject of population came up when talking with relatives....I was told that the population was much higher at some point and to Google it... I did and was astonished by the numbers... I mean.. Communism and the Soviets kinda played a big role in the declining numbers... But here in the states I always run into a lot of fellow Hungarians who are nurses and doctors, have degrees in engineering etc.... When all these jobs are needed in Hungary... But why don't they stay there? Well.... Hahahaha.... The country doesn't pay enough for them to stay! 

If their work isn't respected by the government with money... Then no way in hell are they staying there LOL. But yep.... If I had a job where all I did was work from home... I would definitely live in Hungary or maybe on the border of Austria where I could connect to an Austrian bank and get around the high bank fees and VAT of Hungary while enjoying life there and around family :)

Other than that... Visiting is nice. But living there would be horrible. No offense to those who actually do live there... But once you get used to something better, It becomes tough to even consider living there again or at all WHILE ALSO working there.... Mind you... If I didn't have to work there and earn the money that everyone else makes there and just live there... Then of course that would be amazing..

When you ban something, you have to have a reason why. The reason why incest is banned is because it's cruel to produce offspring with severe genetic disabilities. Strictly speaking, that's eugenics. Our society is still allergic to eugenics because World War II was so recent. If you take away the eugenics argument, the only reason to ban incest (between consenting adults) is ""I personally dislike it,"" which is not a reason to actually ban something.

I do like the idea of a shared currency and the benefits it brings with it, namely the stability that made it the most reliable currency in the world since a single country going through a rough patch can't tank the same currency used in dozens of other countries, but you can't just introduce a shared currency into different countries and economies and expect it to not create such a disparity where higher costs of life in some countries lead to higher salaries and higher salaries lead to the countries without them not being able to compete - not only that, in just about any country there often already is a cost of life disparity between the big cities (the capital and any others of comparable size) and the rest of the country, so imagine how that's going to affect entire countries suffering from the same effect.  

A UBI, or something that would achieve the same result, would do infinitely more good than all of these repeated hand-outs into these other countries. That's treating the symptom and not the cause.

High density is when you have apartments directly on top of businesses, with narrow streets, which creates an atmosphere of pedestrians and makes it easy to install public transport systems.

Eugenics means “according to an internationally consistent understanding, the dirigistic endeavor - however defined -“ improvement ”of the collective genetic material of a population. ”Not only that incest connections of siblings have no significant influence on the gene pool of a population anyway; the (quite existing) higher risk that children from such relationships could develop recessively inherited diseases does not justify any legal interference with the “reproductive freedom” of a couple. The risk of such diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis or spinal muscular atrophy) naturally also exists for children of couples who are not related by blood. If a child already has such a disease, their siblings have a 25% risk of developing the hereditary disease as well. For some diseases, this risk is much higher. However, legislation that prohibits further sexual intercourse in such cases would meet with widespread social rejection, and the right to carry out the risk assessment associated with the desire for children is one of the core elements of personal rights.",Pfalz,/r/europe/comments/iziv5g/legality_of_incest_between_consenting_adults_in/g6kws0l/,punicar,1601073379

4315,"&gt;The husband of one of the Conservative Party's biggest donors was secretly funded by a Russian oligarch with close ties to President Putin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lubov Chernukhin has given £1.7m to the Tories, including paying to spend time with the last three prime ministers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Leaked files show her husband received $8m (£6.1m). The money initially came from a politician facing US sanctions due to his closeness to the Kremlin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her lawyers say the donations are not tainted by Kremlin influence.  
&gt;  
&gt;A leak of banks' ""suspicious activity reports"" - called the FinCEN Files and seen by BBC Panorama - shows Vladimir Chernukhin was sent the money in 2016 from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Suleyman Kerimov.  
&gt;  
&gt;Officials at Deutsche Bank in New York reported it as being among $278.5m of transactions involving the offshore company.  
&gt;  
&gt;There has been an increasing focus on donations to political parties from wealthy UK-based Russians in recent years, with July's parliamentary report by the Intelligence and Security Committee referring to the possibility they could allow people to ""assist Russian influence operations"". 'Not fit and proper donors'  
&gt;  
&gt;Billionaire Mr Kerimov is a member of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. He has been under investigation in France over allegations of tax fraud since 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2018 he was sanctioned by the US authorities, who were targeting those they said ""play a key role in advancing Russia's malign activities"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Chernukhin, 52, is a former deputy minister of finance under Vladimir Putin, who left Russia for London in 2004 after being sacked by the president.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Chernukhins - one of the UK's most prominent Russian-born couples - are now both British citizens and live in London.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mrs Chernukhin's donations to the Conservative Party began in 2012.  
&gt;  
&gt;The majority - more than £1.5m - came after the $8m payment linked to Mr Kerimov was made to her husband on 29 April 2016, although it is not clear if any of that cash went to the Tories.  
&gt;  
&gt;Journalist and Russia expert Edward Lucas, who gave evidence to the parliamentary inquiry into Russian influence, told Panorama: ""The Chernukhins, pleasant people that they might be… are not fit and proper people to make donations to a British political party.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Lucas said he was ""profoundly concerned by the access that, not only Lubov Chernukhin but also other rich Russians have to the heights of the Conservative Party, and to the government"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Mrs Chernukhin's donations to the Tories have given her access to figures at the top of UK government.  
&gt;  
&gt;In return for £135,000 she was invited to a ladies' night dinner at a luxury hotel with Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet in April 2019. She is pictured above, fourth from the right.  
&gt;  
&gt;And the 47-year-old has twice made winning bids at auction for tennis matches with Boris Johnson. The last, in February this year, cost her £45,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2014 she paid £160,000 to play tennis with Prime Minister David Cameron and then London Mayor Mr Johnson.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of this year she is the biggest female donor in British history to the Tories. According to Electoral Commission records, she has given about £1.7m in total over the past eight years, including £335,000 between last January and July.  
&gt;  
&gt;When in 2018, Boris Johnson - then foreign secretary - was asked about the Chernukhins and the £160,000 tennis match donation, he told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way that gentleman… obtained his wealth... then it's possible for our law enforcement agencies to deprive him of his wealth.""  
&gt;  
&gt;But he added ""all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made"" on donations. 'Property projects loan'  
&gt;  
&gt;The $8m payment to Mr Chernukhin was made by an offshore company called Definition Services, which was controlled by Mr Kerimov's children. The documents show their funding came from their father and it was Mr Kerimov who had the personal relationship with Mr Chernukhin.  
&gt;  
&gt;As Deutsche Bank was processing the money, it sent questions to officials at another bank involved in the transaction.  
&gt;  
&gt;They said it was a ""loan between the two parties aiming to support further immovable property projects of the borrower"" and that Definition was involved in real estate investments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite the response, Deutsche Bank filed a suspicious activity report (SAR), noting the link to Mr Kerimov and the payment to Mr Chernukhin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Deutsche said Definition was ""registered and banking out of high risk jurisdictions and the commercial purpose of the transactions and the relationship between the parties could not be determined"".  
&gt;  
&gt;What do we know about the Chernukhin's finances?  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of Mr Chernukhin's financial affairs have been made public as part of a long running legal battle with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska over the ownership of a former industrial site in Moscow.  
&gt;  
&gt;Proceedings at the High Court in London revealed he set up a trust for his wife, and another trust for the benefit of the couple together.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mrs Chernukhin has been described as a former banker.  
&gt;  
&gt;She is listed as a director of four UK companies. One of them shares the same London correspondence address detailed in a bank document concerning the $8m payment to her husband from Definition Services.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lawyers for the Chernukhins declined to say whether Mr Chernukhin had received the $8m.  
&gt;  
&gt;But they said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never received money deriving from Mr Kerimov or any company related to him"" and her ""donations to the Conservative Party have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence"".  
&gt;  
&gt;They added all her donations have been declared in accordance with Electoral Commission rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lawyers for Suleyman Kerimov said he denies all the allegations made by Panorama, and had ""no dealings with Ms Chernukhin whatsoever"".  
&gt;  
&gt;A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""There are people in this country of Russian origin who are British citizens and have the democratic right to donate to a political party. Many have been vocal critics of Putin and it is completely wrong and discriminatory to smear them all with the same brush.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The FinCEN Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed ""dirty money"" to be moved around the world. They also expose how US intelligence sees the UK as a ""higher risk jurisdiction"" and show it is awash with Russian cash from unexplained sources.  
&gt;  
&gt;The files were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 400 journalists around the world.

The point of our rules is to facilitate *polite, reasonable and well informed* discussion rather than simply have people yelling the first thing to come to their minds. 

We had incidents in the past where similar attacks happened, people started posting about ""trucks of peace"" and it turned out not to be a Muslim. [Here is a thread about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8apdjk/on_yesterdays_events_shitholes_and_qa/). We aren't saying that you aren't allowed to discuss Islam or Islamic terrorism. All we ask is that we first have the first clue of what happened before we start blaming this or that.

Being close to family was wonderful, especially as both my grandmother and a cousin passed away this year, but with time I found I was really missing the life I had in France so now I’m working to return again. 

It’s a very hard thing because there are elements I really do like about both places. I will never be able to replace my US and Canadian family and friends in Europe, but I will never be able to replace the French culture and work-life balance in North America.

And Merkel didn't invite them. Merkel in 2015 only invited the Syrian refugees that were stuck in Hungary, i.e. she voluntarily suspended the Dublin regulation so that they wouldn't have to be send back to Greece.
If Merkel would want more refugees we would take all of them out of Greece instead of just 1500. And we only take them out of Greece because Greece cannot deal with them, not because we want them.
All you can do is blame Germany for being richer than that the other EU countries, so that most migrants want to come to Germany. But if Germany wouldn't exist then they would simply go to the second richest EU country.
And Germany is only the richest EU country because we have the most inhabitants and because we don't go into debt, not because Germans are so rich.

V4 is just right wing virtue signalling. They have no skin in the game, because no migrants wants to come to V4 anyway. So they don't offer real, practical solutions but only right wing virtue signal.
If you want Greece to have better border control then talk to Greece and stop blaming Germany. Germany isn't getting in the way.

4538,"&gt;So the ultraconservatives overestimated their influence and shoot themselves in the foot and basically lost any chance for real direct-influence on the military, foreign policy and intelligence-sector by turning the less conservative parts of their party and the Demorkate against them?

It seems so. They are still complaining about it and are trying to undermine Krivokapic as he seems to be restricting their influence.  It seems unlikely they will get these positions after this debacle. This has alos fueled stories that Krivokapic is planning on forming a Christian-Democratic party which would drag over much of the DF's membership and leave DF potentially as a outer rime party. This is however only rumours.  


Demokrate never like the extreme wing of the party and both them and URA are strongly supporting Krivokapic in this power conflict.   


On the other hand the other extreme the DPS has according to today's polling lost 1/6 of their support and there is talks of a new party being formed and the party being split.  


This all leaves potential for the collapse of both extreme wings in Montenegro in a single election, although this is quite optimistic.

&amp;#x200B;

A mire, peatland, or quagmire is a wetland type, dominated by living peat-forming plants. Mires arise because of incomplete decomposition of organic matter, usually litter from vegetation, due to water-logging and subsequent anoxia. All types of mires share the common characteristic of being saturated with water at least seasonally with actively forming peat while having its own set of vegetation and organisms. Like coral reefs, mires are unusual landforms in that they derive mostly from biological rather than physical processes, and can take on characteristic shapes and surface patterning.

There are four types of mire: bog, fen, marsh, and swamp.

Mires have declined globally due to drainage for agriculture and forestry, and for peat harvesting. For example, more than 50% of original European mire area, more than 300000 km2, has been lost. Some of the largest losses have been in Russia, Finland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Poland and Belarus.

Wetlands make up about 5-8% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface but contain about 20-30% of the planet’s 2500 Gt soil carbon stores. Mires, (e.g., bogs, fens, and marshes) are the wetland types that contain the highest amounts of soil organic carbon

Greenhouse gases and fires: Damaged peatlands contribute about 10% of greenhouse gas emissions from the land-use sector. CO2 emissions from drained peatlands are estimated at 1.3 gigatonnes of CO2 annually. This is equivalent to 5.6% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Fires in Indonesian peat swamp forests in 2015, for example, emitted nearly 16 million tonnes of CO2 a day. This is more than the daily emissions from the entire US economy.",Latvia,/r/europe/comments/izmyxd/peatlandalso_known_as_a_mire_or_quagmire_cover_of/g6jtbfk/,Art1ns,1601052269

4614,"Sorry for answering so late, I was pretty busy in the past days.

Honestly speaking, I had countless of discussions like the one we are having when the same question was being discussed in Germany (mainly from about 2000 to 2010). It has always turned out that those who insisted on not calling same-sex marriage ""marriage"" did, in the deepest of their heart, think that same-sex relationships are less valuable than different-sex marriages.

This is not really surprising because when people truly think that same-sex relationships are as valuable as different-sex relationships then they are painfully aware of two things:

(1) There is a chunk of the population for whom same-sex relationships are less valuable, and they wish to change that.

(2) Calling same-sex marriage ""marriage"" will, over time, contribute to making it obvious that same-sex relationships are as valuable as different-sex relationships.

Once someone has realized this, and if they really think that same-sex relationships are as valuable as different-sex relationships, they will say, yes, let's call it ""marriage"", too, and it will improve the situation for same-sex couples without taking anything away from different-sex couples.

This is why that those people who still insist on ""recognizing them properly"", as you write, are ultimately those who are left over and still think that same-sex relationships are less valuable.

And this is also the reason why in pretty much all Westen European countries same-sex couples can marry now. There was simply no argument against gay marriage left except ""same-sex relationships are ultimately less valuable"". And this argument was not convincing anymore, and this is why those people who insisted on ""recognizing them properly"", as you write, ultimately lost the public debate.

This ""recognizing-them-properly"" argument turned out to be as little convincing as if someone said that we needed a different word for marriages between Jews or black people, ""because they are different after all"". 

Regarding the legislation problem you address in your last paragraph: In Germany there are about 600 different laws that entail consequences when a couple is married (this goes from tax via pensions and inheritance to insurances, to the right to visit your partner in hospital, etc.) To set up 600 new laws for same-sex couples would have been way more complex than adjusting a small number of  laws to support adoptions or insemination. (Actually the only law in Germany that is being discussed now is about automatically giving the partner of a lesbian couple the status of ""mother"" when a child is born in a marriage between two women. All other things are already covered by standard laws.) So opening up marriage for same-sex couples is also the easier way from a legal perspective.",Berlin,/r/europe/comments/ix4jwo/same_sex_marrige_civil_partnership_in_europe/g6je3p6/,nibbler666,1601044556

4643,"&gt;Soviets kept almost half a million soldiers alone in Baltic states (with Riga as their comand center) , so yeah that's your ''population'' that was also counted in the statistics plus the families of those Soviet soldiers and officers

Soldiers were never counted in censuses in the places where they were serving (nor were they of course accompanied by their families), so the number is of course considerably smaller than that.

&gt;Albeit Soviet version was not as hardcore, the core idea behind it was still the same and just as evil.

Funny how the ethnic Baltic population increased during this attempt to deport them. Also funny how in Lithuania, where resistance to Soviet rule was the greatest, the Russian population increase was by far the smallest.
  
In reality, if the Soviets actually wanted to do so, they could have easily carried it out during Stalin's time.

In Italy it's still a crime if the minor (&lt;18) is under the adult's authority or responsibility.

So while a random 20-something can indeed have sex with a minor (over 14) if they're complete strangers, it's still a crime if the older partner is, say, a teacher, an instructor or any person with a degree of ""power"" over the minor.

And of course if it's a relative, it fits the criteria by default.

In practice though, most adults having an underage partner can technically be counted as holding some authority over the minor by the mere factor of age difference. At least it's easy to play that card if someone isn't ok with the relationship (e.g. a parent, a sibling etc can easily report the adult as having groomed/brainwashed the minor and it's gonna get ugly pretty quickly).

There were 80% of ethnic Latvians in Latvia in 1940, barely 50% in 1980, 2 more decades and they would be minority in their own land and then we would have the same thing as with Crimean Tatars in Crimea........take a look how many of them are left in their own homeland, practically none. Russians ethnically cleaned them away and even now are suppringing any nationalism of theirs at this very day.  

And it was all done on purpose, it didn't just ''whoops, that happened'', there were intentional actions by the Soviet government to make it like that. What else would you call it if not ethnic cleansing?

• Take responsibility for returning to their countries of origin some persons with no right to remain in the EU

I am all for Poland trying to get there, but Poles should really be careful not to get frustrated, stuff likes this takes decades, as I already wrote. 

And well, communism is not as clear cut as you make it out to be. Remember, before WW2, Poland had a GDP lower then that of the city of Berlin alone. It started out really, really low. 

And though communism stifled Polish growth later on, it also did a lot of invetments in Poland in the early stages. 

So I agree the communism really hampered Poland in it's economic development, but not to the degree a lot of people make it out to be. 

Po9land is also on the edge of the EU, an countries on edges tend to have a slower development, that is a result of economics and trade proximity. That will eventually change should Belarus and Ukraine ever join the EU, but for now it is that it is.

5021,"&gt; It's also false because they intend to bring in their family later.

Or so they say. Also, this makes no sense, as in Western developed countries, the job market for women, especially educated women (and Muslim countries have this visible in numbers trend, that men don't do higher education much, while women do, as they see it as a ticket to a better future) have a much higher chance on the job market, of having a job that pays more. Also, with the vast over-representation of men since many decades, but much more so since 2015, if they really wanted to get there families in, the protests and riots that sometimes happen, made by migrants, should be in front of immigration offices with the demand to let families re-unite. But the family reuniting schemes that do happen - the EU has some, have little popularity. This also makes sense in pure statistics. The men who come here are TOO YOUNG. The usually HAVE NO wives and children. So nobody to get into the EU using family reunification ideas.

Not sure what you mean by the second comment. All I stated is backed by official statistics. Some not promoted much, but all official, EU, Eurostat, countries, .edu websites, renown medical magazines etc. So if you need the data in a link, just ask, which one you mean and I'll deliver...

Nope, I never complained about that. From my first comment I said I was for bringing families, women, and the vulnerable in. You can check my story on Reddit for almost 5 years (Google Translate the part in Polish) and you won't find a single comment that would make me belong to what you called ""people like you"". The thing is your ideals might be write, but you are acting, well, like the far right, assuming my political stand on some weird new stereotypes, not on anything I've actually written in this discussion or earlier.

The last sentence, is well, ironic. Cause that works both ways. And the most controversial usage here is actually yours. That most male migrants want to bring their families, as, well, as I pointed out, a majority of the are too young and have NO immediate families covered by re-unification programs (as in wife, children). Sure those programs, are ageist, probably due to cold economy, as parents very rarely fall under them, but I would be OK with reuniting with parents and siblings also. But as I said, this isn't visible. Also, why always send the brother/son and not daughter/sister if that is the case? And no, don't give me the cultural BS argument. I work for a Suadi/Emirati company and basically inspect our offices on three continents for a living. Islamic culture (not all migrants are even Islamic though) is one thing, but even the most conservative families, if they wanted the whole family to move, would send the child that could make it happen easiest. And no, it wouldn't be the son in 80-95%. 55-65%, maybe 70% would be somewhat believable, but the proportions are whack for culture, even more so combined with the number of university graduates - women surpassed man in the UAE and KSA even, and in the poor countries which people want to leave, they did that long ago.",,/r/europe/comments/iyvb3v/world_becoming_less_tolerant_of_migrants_new_poll/g6gr849/,JoseMikey,1600979813

Managing immigration into the EU isn't hard. its just like managing immigration in a regular country. You establish a  set of criteria under which you allow migrants and asylum seekers to come here and not allow/deport those who do not fulfill that criteria. not that hard to apply.

The big problem comes from a lot of globalist politicians who want to allow mass waves of migrants into Europe in spite of voters not wanting them to do so and being extremely inflexible when it comes to this issue. I am afraid that this hidden globalism will not work for long as ultra nationalistic parties are climbing up the power structures in virtually every country.

Bringing Freedom™ to those who do not want it is not our domain. But now that they are begging for our help and attention while being pulled from the streets and straight into rape vans as payback for daring to want to be free, we could not remain silent. I know it's hard to believe in this jaded realpolitik world, but it's still a touchy and emotional subject to some, there were a lot of Lithuanians who went to Ukraine to fight, you know.

Also, there's the factor of Lukanshenka reneging on his role as the supposed protector of Belarusian sovereignty and promising to finally merge into the Union State, in no uncertain terms. Prior to this ridiculously rigged election, there was a period rapprochement, Lithuania was shipping Norwegian oil day and night to Belarus by rail because Luka had had a falling out with Putin and had allowed their oil contracts to expire, US had announced that they would be sending an ambassador to Belarus again, and previous EU sanctions were lifted, so there was some naivete about changes possibly occurring in the regime, and a willingness to spur them on and to play along.

1. Russia receives the full amount it paid for the Mistral ships + compensation

5097,"&gt; Or so they say. 

Because it makes more sense to think that they are cool with their wife and children dying? Is that what *you* would do or why are you even thinking about such inhuman ideas?

&gt; Also, this makes no sense, Also, this makes no sense, as in Western developed countries, the job market for women, especially educated women (and Muslim countries have this visible in numbers trend, that men don't do higher education much, while women do, as they see it as a ticket to a better future) have a much higher chance on the job market, of having a job that pays more.

Do you think people fleeing from war-torn countries research the job market for women on the internet before deciding where to go? 

&gt; But the family reuniting schemes that do happen - the EU has some, have little popularity.

Source?

&gt; All I stated is backed by official statistics. 

You spend so much time writing a long comment but none on showing those statistics. Why?

&gt; Nope, I never complained about that. From my first comment I said I was for bringing families, women, and the vulnerable in.

Unless men are part of those families or vulnerable. 

&gt; you are acting, well, like the far right, assuming my political stand on some weird new stereotypes, not on anything I've actually written in this discussion or earlier.

Interesting, considering you are assuming that migrants are ok with leaving their families to die.

&gt; The last sentence, is well, ironic.

You ignored the sentences before that. Here is it again: The left is not ok with that. They want to bring families together.

&gt; a majority of the are too young

Source?

&gt; Also, why always send the brother/son and not daughter/sister if that is the case?

&gt; if they wanted the whole family to move, would send the child that could make it happen easiest.

Maybe they think that applies to male children? 

&gt; And no, it wouldn't be the son in 80-95%

I dont think you should be entitled to asylum if you cross several safe countries and are just asylum shopping. That goes against the whole concept and logic of seeking asylum.

&gt; As I said previously, there is nothing in law that says asylum has to be sought in the first safe country.

Depends, there were for example the Dublin Regulations, but we have outdated laws that dont work well against  the current problems, maybe laws need to be changed to reflect whats going on now.

&gt; What are they seeking asylum from? Why don’t you look at the news and see why people are leaving their own countries?

They didnt come from their own countries. They came from France, they were safe there. Why do they need the UK's protection now?

5301,"&gt; Nope. Solar and wind are as expensive as new nuclear power plants.

Nuclear is 3-4 times more expensive. I just cited a source, stop spreading misinformation.

&gt;Prolonging the lifetime of existing nuclear plants is the cheapest way of reducing co2, so cheaper than solar, wind or new plants. 

No, it's about as cheap as new wind power. It's of course only available in limited quantity.

&gt;But existing plants are not enough, we need new plants if we are to reach our co2 goals.

On the contrary, wasting time and money on nuclear plants will make it harder to reach our goals in time.

&gt;Nuclear power provides a stable and reliable source of power, wind and solar don't. 

Besides the point, what matters is the total supply, and both sources need supplementation with a flexible source.

&gt;Nuclear power can follow load, wind and solar can't.

Nuclear power can follow load by making itself even more expensive than it is already, and if you're going to pay for flexible capacity anyway you're better off with a cheaper base power. That also doesn't force you to deal with a host of problems like waste, proliferation, accidents.

&gt;An electricity network can not run on wind and solar without large scale storage solution,

There's no need for more than 1% of yearly demand in storage (for example in the form of existing hydro plants) to get to 80% of renewable energy on the net. That already matches and surpasses France's share of nuclear electricity, even before taking transmission, demand management, or power to x methods into account.

Say a farmer grows 10 acres of carrots. He has to supply those to a particular spec of weight, length, colour etc. His final yield may be 50 or 60% in spec so a use has to be found for those out of spec carrots.

They're mostly fed to ruminants, upcycling if you like, rather than dumped or composted, and a high quality protein stock is the result. Now, the excess carrots and the ground they're grown on is counted as part of your 36% above which it shouldn't as they're a byproduct of an already used food.

Similar creative accounting procedure are used for byproducts of bread, corn for ethanol, barley for beer and whisky. The greatest value is in what's extracted, though much smaller in volume.

5499,"A few excerpts 

""Orban has put Hungary’s security forces front and centre of the fight against the novel coronavirus, with police officials chairing daily press conferences, military commanders assigned to head major hospitals and military advisers deployed in key strategic companies to ensure their smooth running.

Where every other cabinet portfolio has seen its budget cut for 2021, Hungary’s defence ministry will receive a 30-per cent increase in funding to 778 billion forints [2.2 billion euros], including the purchase of hardware from helicopters to battle tanks and missile defence systems.

The government has announced a military modernisation drive over the coming decades worth 8.5 billion euros. 

Hungary is estimated to have fewer than 10,000 deployable troops, with efforts to recruit more hampered by the below-average wages paid to soldiers. Conscription was scrapped in 2004 and there are no apparent plans to bring it back.

The government wants to increase the number of soldiers to 50,000 in total by 2026, including more than 30,000 professional soldiers and 20,000 reservists.

The new recruits will come from up to 10 new military high schools that the government wants to open over the next 10 years. """,,/r/europe/comments/iywimd/hungarian_pm_viktor_orban_has_begun_expanding_the/g6f376s/,theFutureisBraun,1600951740
