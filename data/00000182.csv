1,"It is a much better idea to read what both sides say themselves, the linked article is, ahem, ever so slightly sensationalist.

Both sides are unwilling to admit simple contractual fuckups. The actual selection itself isn't very popular at all (the entire number of sms votes is below 0.5% of population, even if you hope for 1 sms sent per person). The scandal is however being blown way out of proportion and mass media running wild with saucy sensations have burried any prospect of resolution days ago.

The singer herself says that the problem isn't in her concerts in Russia and she was ok with dropping them in favor of Eurovision if need be. 
She was, however, from the start, simply unable to comply with published rules. The demand for the winner to hand over the rights to the song was published before the selection began. Yet she chose to perform a song owned by the Russian division of Warner Bros. Exactly how she was gonna pass the rights she does not own remains unknown.

The national broadcaster, instead of doing their job of enforcing the rules before getting to a legal dead end, start pulling on demands, like having final say in Maruvs live performance and interviews. Given her stage image she is quite right in not wanting to trust some stuffy paperpusher with that.  And, more importantly, they don't even have the budget to support her this year, which they really should have said way sooner.",,/r/europe/comments/avfvw1/ukraine_withdraws_from_the_2019_eurovision_song/ehg97vc/,vstromua,1551326204

4,"Hopefully it won't intensify after Brexit. Our politicians must know that the main driving force behind the Leave vote was dissatisfaction with immigration, including (or perhaps particularly) immigration from outside the EU. You have to remember that the vote was in 2015, the peak of the migrant crisis, and the EU was seen as an institution that wanted to open Europe's borders to the third world. Whether it was reasonable or not, a vote to leave the EU was as much an expression of disagreement with the mass immigration of non-Europeans into Europe as it was about anything. If the government has any sense of public opinion whatsoever, they won't increase immigration from the third world after Brexit.

There shouldn't be any need to replace the immigrants lost either. Significant immigrant labour is not, and should never, be a necessity. When natives consider jobs to be beneath them for whatever reason (unfulfilling work, overly long hours, low pay, etc), I think the solution is to make those jobs more appealing rather than import foreign workers who are desperate enough to do them, and who will drive wages down further.

I couldn't find a breakdown of immigrants per year by country of origin, but it seems likely that Polish people overtook Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis since they became our largest foreign-born population in 2015. Whether Polish immigration overtook all South Asian immigration put together while we were in the EU, I don't know.",England,/r/europe/comments/avgrtb/bradford_grooming_nine_jailed_for_abusing_girls/ehg9f3h/,anglosaxonbloke,1551326371

27,"Is there enough support for a second referendum?

For any option (other than a no-deal Brexit), a majority of MPs need to agree on it.  Hard Brexiters can wait one month and get their no-deal Brexit.  For everyone else, if they can't form a majority, a no-deal Brexit is what they'll get.

So, who is going to compromise?

If Soft Brexiters agree to another referendum, they'll likely lose it.  So, they don't want another referendum.  While they don't want to crash out, once the UK is out, any Remainers will want to vote for whatever deal makes the UK closer to the EU, right?.  So, Soft Brexiters can wait three months and probably get what they want after a really harsh transition.  Once the UK leaves, any deal that improves relations is positive for Remainers.  So, Soft Brexiters can also bide their time.

Of course, Remainers could hold out hope that a couple years from now, the UK will be begging to get back into the EU and they'll get their wish...so Remainers can wait out a couple disastrous years and get what they want if they make sure that any Soft Brexit agreement doesn't happen that could make Brexit easier on people.

Ultimately, it's a game of chicken between Soft Brexiters and Remainers.  Soft Brexiters want Remainers to vote for their deal - under the threat that the UK will crash out.  If the UK agrees to the Soft Brexit deal, it's likely that things will stay close enough to the status quo that there won't be a huge push to rejoin the EU.  So Remainers don't want to sign on to the deal, despite it being a lot better than a Hard Brexit, because it would erode support for remaining or rejoining the EU.

Who will stop the madness first?  Right now, it looks like no one.  I understand why they wouldn't want to cede this ground because they each have a goal.

Especially about something as serious as murder. And what purpose would it serve? No one’ getting rich by hiding murder numbers.

If you don’t believe the Indian media consisting are thousands of big and small companies, BBC, CNN, NBC, Al Jazeera and nearly all EU and US media companies operate in India.

Stray dogs in a country with lots of rabies? Possibly, I'd be okay with them just killing a potentially rabies carrying stray dog. Stray dogs are routinely killed in such countries so yeah... 

[Pretty sure rabies is extinct in most of North-Western Europe though.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rabies_Free_Countries_Sourced_2010.svg) So this doesn't apply to most highly developed European countries.

&gt; Is a rat not a living being? They're known to be highly social and intelligent too.

It is, its just not human. Nor is it really native to Europe and is an invasive species. Unlike dogs(ignoring Australia), rats do survive in the wild and wreck havoc on native wildlife. 

Its like all the worst parts of a pet like a dog and an highly successful invasive wild species combined. Except its not a pet like a dog that's been selectively bred for 10,000 years++ to connect emotionally to humans and its much more likely to spread diseases than our canine friends.

80,"The problem is the peculiarities of who should vote, even if we magically roll back to 2013 and give the referendum a suitably long preparatory period, not the couple of weeks it had. If all citizens of Ukraine vote, as Ukrainian law would have it, Ukraine comfortably wins. If  only Crimeans vote (for some definitions of ""Crimeans"") Russia comfortably wins. 

The reason that kind of referendum requires an all-Ukrainian vote (which Russia will not agree to) is threefold:
1) Nothing prevented me, a Ukrainian citizen, to own property and business in Crimea under Ukrainian law even if I mostly resided elsewhere. Why does somebody else suddenly gain the right to decide the fate of my stuff?
2) Ukrainian state, and therefore all Ukrainian citizens, own stuff in Crimea. Like the Ukrainian ships that Russians hold, state owned infrastructure, buildings, facilities and so on. Say, my block of flats has joint ownership over the nearby parking lot. You cannot take the lot by only asking the guy on the first floor, since he's nearest to it. You have to ask every flat owner, even the ones without a car.
3) Crimea was a net acceptor of state funds in Ukraine. Year after year taxpayers all over Ukraine were giving Crimea money, and that is perfectly fine in itself. If they knew that they will have no say in Crimean referendum, would they not prefer their taxes spent elsewhere?",,/r/europe/comments/avj7z1/us_to_russia_crimea_is_ukraine_and_must_be/ehge3rr/,vstromua,1551330630

So grouping togther makes sense for them. But the UK, Germany &amp; France are not those countries. They are by far, by many orders of magnitude they are greater and more influential &amp; powerful on the global stage than every other country in the EU combined. The UK especially is a class apart. The EU from a geopolitical and soft and hard power view needs the UK more than the UK needs the EU. 


Also the idea that the EU is some unified country like the USA is laughable. The EU is actually just 27 countries all with their own cultures, languages, vastly different economies/income levels/interests etc Its still individual counties trying to screw each other over, there is no real unity or 'European' identity or nationality. You cant even agree on the smallest things. How can you portray the EU as this one country when it lacks all the things that make a country a country??..

And India.. lol they dont even have toilets &amp; basic hygeine ffs, and im expected to believe they're greater than the UK?, Lol ffs get real people. India will most likely never have its shit together.

Firstly, for many of us Irish in the north, it wasn't generations ago, it is well within living memory for most, and for those it isn't, it's likely their family were affected by it. Bad feelings have recently resurfaced again because decisions made by a British parliament and a vote passed by English folk is threatening to at the the very least form a barrier between ourselves and what we deem our rightful homeland and at worst putting Irish lives at risk. 

Secondly, Unionists aren't hostile because Irish people don't like Britain. Unionists have been hostile to Irishness since they were planted 400 years ago. They were literally chosen as a peoples because of how loyal and non-intergrative they would be. They held dominion over the native Irish for centuries and were consistently told that the Irish were inferior and that their britishness is what makes them better. As recently as the late 20th century Irish people in the north were still heavily discriminated against by unionists to the point of being treated like second class citizens. I think irish fears and grievances are a bit more warranted, especially considering the main unionist talking point seems to be the troubles and how it affected them, despite the fact the conditions for it were caused by unionists, the first actions to kick it off were carried out by unionists and the proportion of civilians killed is predominantly due to unionist actions. GTFO with that shite.

Don't downplay warranted grievances. I'm guessing you're from a unionist background (correct me if i'm wrong, most nationalists wouldn't have an ulster flair), so the entire notion of generational grievances or trauma may seem quite alien to you.

183,"&gt; The fact that you're incapable of actually explaining how the process works says it all.

It's a simplified explanation, but everything I wrote is factually correct (though in hindsight I'd probably clarify that the council consists usually of the head of states of the European members, not the entire governments themselves, obviously). You can read a more detailed explanation on the [EU's official website](https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en)

&gt; No the council is just going to keep proposing it again and again year after year until it's accepted like they always do.

A piece of legislation can only pass between the council and parliament three times before a conciliation committee tries to find a solution, and if this fails, legislation is rejected. Besides, considering your previous rather vapid remark in mind, the council doesn't ""propose"" anything. The primary branch that instigates legislation is the European Commision. In other words, the fact that you're incapable of actually understanding a basic aspect of how the EU works says it all.

&gt; This isn't unfortunately true. Controversial (read terrible) legislation will just be endlessly proposed until quietly accepted. The system doesn't work at all.

The norm in the EU is that more than often, when a piece of legislation is rejected, the legislation is often changed to take account for the opposition. This happens on every scale from niche proposals to major treaties (e.g. Maastricht).

For someone who has very strong opinions of the EU you don't seem to able to give your disgruntlement much substance beyond vapid catch-all complaints that are more often heard from couch potato voters than someone actually invested in politics.",,/r/europe/comments/avdb0i/one_of_many_reasons/ehg2yio/,N7Crazy,1551321227

Nothing changed. That is just a minor part where Francisco Franco was glorified.

We have a guy touring Croatia with his book in which he states that the Nazi concentration camps didn't exist, or that they were in fact humanitarian facilities. Even something like amusement parks. Who is the organizer of his tour? Catholic Church. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor\_Vuki%C4%87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Vuki%C4%87) Note how he is telling one thing in Croatia and another to Simon Wiesenthal Center.

Just go to any news portal in Croatia and express in your comment anything that does not correspond to the narrative of Catholic Croatia. Not only you will receive insults, you will receive threatening messages in your FB Messenger inbox very quickly. Number of attacks on journalists and writers in Croatia that oppose to this revision of history is significant, and those people constantly receive death threats. Some of those things happened to me personally. And I'm a Croat, born in Croatia with both parents Croats.

Croatian right-wingers are known to deny, or to decide themselves who is a good Croat and Croat at all. The same was in the times of so-called Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi and fascist puppet regime. You can watch the film journals from that time, like this one [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_DBwMM-cQa8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DBwMM-cQa8) where it is said that to every Croat, that is a VALID member of his nation, the government must provide ""a life worthy of a human"". So, there are Croats that are not valid members of Croatian people.

The same goes on today, Croats that are members of the ruling party are provided with ""a life worthy of a human"", others have to move to other countries to be able to work and get a decent salary. Many of the people that moved out of Croatia in recent years will tell you that they are fed up with Croatian clerical fascism.

414,"&gt;European Parliament committees have backed Romania’s Laura Codruta Kovesi to be the EU’s first chief prosecutor, putting them at odds with member states that voted for a rival candidate after strong lobbying by Bucharest.

&gt;Romania’s ruling Socialists fiercely oppose Ms Codruta Kovesi’s bid to lead the new European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO), having seen her successfully pursue some of its leading members as head of the country’s anti-corruption agency.

&gt;The government forced her out of that post last year, while pushing through major judicial reforms that have alarmed the EU and United States and sparked street protests by Romanians who fear anti-graft efforts are being blunted. The controversy has dominated Romania’s current presidency of the EU.

&gt;The European Parliament’s civil liberties committee gave Ms Codruta Kovesi 26 votes in Wednesday’s ballot, ahead of France’s Jean-Francois Bohnert on 22 votes and Andres Ritter of Germany with one vote.

&gt;A vote by the parliament’s committee for budgetary control delivered the same outcome on Tuesday.

&gt;The results reinvigorated Ms Codruta Kovesi’s hopes following a galling defeat last week, when ambassadors of member states voted for Mr Bohnert amid intense efforts by the Bucharest government to undermine her candidacy.

&gt;&gt;**Secret pacts**                                        
-

&gt;Romania’s justice minister Tudorel Toader told EU colleagues that Ms Codruta Kovesi made “secret and anti-democratic pacts” with the security services, and a new investigative unit run by government loyalists recently launched a case against her for alleged abuse of office and bribery – allegations she flatly denies.

&gt;“This vote is for all Romanian citizens who have supported the fight against corruption and for the rule of law, and for all prosecutors in Romania and in Europe who are working under pressure,” Ms Codruta Kovesi said after Wednesday’s victory.

&gt;“I am honoured by today’s vote, but we must wait for the decision of the (European) Council, which is a political decision,” she added, while also expressing support for Romanian prosecutors, judges and magistrates who stopped work this week in protest at the government’s reforms.

&gt;&gt;**Finalise decision**
-

&gt;The European Parliament is expected to finalise its decision on a candidate early next month, and an appointment will be made after agreement is reached with the European Council of member-state governments.

&gt;“It’s going to be a very challenging discussion,” Claude Moraes, the chair of the European Parliament’s civil liberties committee, told Bloomberg.

&gt;“National sovereignty has always been very protected. This is a really sensitive and important position.”

&gt;The EPPO will investigate the annual theft of hundreds of millions of euro in EU funds and major cross-border tax fraud, which could lead to clashes with governments and ruling parties – like Romania’s own – which have poor records on fighting corruption.

520,"&gt;You do realise how absurd your position is? You are literally contenting with natives on a topic that you don't even understand. 

I have no idea what the position of those natives is. For all I know, they could simply be on the opposing side. 

  However, the situation is plain and clear: Russia started two actual wars in Europe during the last 10 years, and at least one of them is still ongoing for the 5th year with 15'000 already dead. 

You wanna count how the death tolls of American troops in the Mid-East for the last few decades? Or just the amount of *actual Chinese citizens* the CCP has killed? A number which is staggeringly high, and likely in the millions by now. Literally the only thing to say in reply to this to even it out would be, ""Well, Russia isn't as powerful"" - which, true, it isn't, and that's one of the main reasons it's not as real of a concern. I don't say this as whataboutism but more to do with what you said after

&gt;So, yes, Russia is evil, there's no other option on that. And, yes, their propaganda is evil, too 

In the sense that it sees itself a a great power? Or what exactly do you mean? Are America and China less evil, then? How about Israel? Saudi Arabia? Like, how is it possible that you can't see how warped your view is? America is literally prepping up for an intervention in Venezuela and spreading lies about what's going on there, even as nearly the entire international community is against it, especially many of their allies in Europe. So, is America not evil? Or is it evil too but you just don't think it's relevant to the topic? Because I'd be absolutely amazed to hear why only Russia is evil when we have evidence of others countries doing things just as bad if not worse. 

&gt; Just as they ""didn't think it through properly"" when called for burning the hearts of gay people at prime time on the state TV. Or just as they ""didn't think it through properly"" when described how they can turn our planet into ""nuclear ashes"" on the state TV. Or any other hate speech / warmongering accident which they produce on a daily basis (not an exaggeration). 

There are plenty of examples of people warmongering in every country though. I just gave you the example of America above. How is this any different? Because this affects you while the other doesn't? Pure self-interest? 

&gt; Seriously, why we are having this conversation? It's just your bloody roubles (not a metaphor) they pay you for rehabilitating the murderers, or is there any other reason here? 

Because I think you're wrong, and I'm trying to understand why exactly you think Russia is the worst compared to the rest of the world. Of course, we are biased against them as eastern Europeans, but the evidence isn't there to support that they're caused more death and misery than others. Like, before you insulted me and called me a progressive, and now you're making a big thing about some anti-gay sermon on Russian TV. That's pretty ironic.

Still, if you get a job you should be able to afford a loan and buy something no matter how small. That’s what most people that I know have done.

The thing is, I don’t think deregulation is going to solve the problem.

671,"&gt;It isn't clear at all that people in the UK don't want to be part of the EU.

Of course not, a significant minority are quite happy with it. That said, even with it only being a slim majority that don't want to be part of the EU, surely that indicates a pretty massive problem? If you only have minority support (whether that's 49.9% or 30%...) for a political union, it loses its legitimacy rather rapidly. How can anyone justify remaining in an integrating EU when there clearly isn't support for that? Even if the UK did somehow reverse it's current position, the government couldn't exactly consent to any changes within the EU in terms of further integration, given the opposition (even among remainers..) to defence integration, centralised budgets, the Euro, Schengen and so on and so forth, the UK in the EU would end up having to be a block on any movement at all..

&amp;#x200B;

Of course not everyone in the UK opposes EU membership, but only a minority are in support of it, and arguably even that minority is pretty weak and not motivated by the positives of EU membership, but rather fairly narrow concerns about the economic impact of leaving.  Or to put it another way, if there was consensus that the UK leaving the EU would not harm the UK economy, nor improve it, I'm willing to bet that the number of people who wanted the UK out of the EU would be significantly higher...",North West Macedonia,/r/europe/comments/avbgmv/do_your_duty_on_brexit_may_tells_mps/eheism5/,-ah,1551283643

Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU heads of state propose a candidate for Commission President, taking into account the results of European elections. The candidate is elected by the EP.
The EP can censure the Commission and ultimately dismiss it. So far, none of the eight motions of censure brought before Parliament has been adopted. In 1999, the Santer Commission stepped down before Parliament forced its resignation. The EP ensures democratic control over the Commission, which regularly submits reports to Parliament including an annual report on EU activities and on the implementation of the budget. Once a year, the Commission President gives a State of the Union address to plenary. Parliament regularly invites the Commission to initiate new policies and the Commission is required to reply to oral and written questions from MEPs.’

And this only matters if you are in one of the major countries, because your few MEPs do not make a difference.

&gt;the European Parliament is not claiming more power over the people

But it has been doing that. Your ALDE guy demanded more power from member states. Yes, in this case the EP did nudge the power balance within the EU, but these changes should not happen without the consent of the governed.

&gt;Used to be, informally. Again, France is the 2nd most important EU member state and an influential founding member. What do you expect?

The most important language is English, the most important country is Germany, so French being third doesn't make sense. But it happens anyway because it suits the interests of the European bureaucrats.

&gt;Politicians care about their constituencies. If you're elected to the European Parliament for Slovakia, than sure, you will care primarily about representing your Slovak voters. 

And if there is an important law that needs to be changed in Slovakia people can raise the point in national debates and election coverage. The politicians will care about that, because they represent a party. In the EP this is not the case.

&gt;In nation states, parliamentarians also represent only certain parts of the electorate, even though they as a collective body should pursue national interest. A Christian-Conservative MP in the Czech parliament will hardly represent the interest of LGBT community, and nor should he – he was elected to represent conservative Christians who oppose these things

You can change the composition of who is being represented inside a nation state. If the public decides that LGBT rights are vital then the Christian conservative won't be elected. They might not even be included in a party, because it would harm the party's platform. In the EU it is impossible that French politicians will care about what Slovakian voters want. They won't even know what the Slovakian people want.

&gt;This is simply how representative democracy works, regardless of whether this happens on a national or European level.

It works differently on a national level compared to the European level because of what I outlined above. On a national level you have party platforms and every politician adheres to it to some degree, because you vote for the party and not the candidate. That's not the case in the EU and it cannot be the case because they are separate countries and they speak different languages.

&gt;MEPs congregate based on ideology, not nationality.

But the problem is that there is and cannot be discussion about the ideology because no French politician will ever care about what Slovaks want.

&gt;Also, smaller countries are actually over-represented in both the European Parliament and the Council, so all they need is to stick together and they can easily block any decision that would unduly favour bigger countries. 

Peasants were actually overrepresented in the middle ages. All they had to do was stick together and they couldn't easily blocked decisions by the lords. Divide and conquer strategies undermine this and because member states have their own political power this is being done. Even right now we hear talk about how we need to change the EU system so that we can fuck over Ireland in favor of the bigger countries.

&gt;People often think that the EU is a Franco-German tool for dominating Europe, but it is in fact the biggest hindrance to the same.

But it isn't. If the EU were not a political union then a country could simply not deal with Germany or France and they would be okay. If you try doing that right now then the EU punishes you. Just look at the UK.

&gt;Cool, how's that relevant to a debate about European Parliament politics?

Ah, I misread. Thank you for the correction.

&gt;I wonder when these ambitions will come to fruition. 15 years ago the government was heavily criticised because procurement laws allowed that Bundeswehr spy satellites were launched by the Russians. Since then the government couldn't be arsed to attempt changing procurement laws to make sure that procurements concerning national security can be limited to EU/EEA if it makes sense. It's ridiculous, we have these capabilities in Europe, we use German tax money to keep these capabilities, but instead of launching our own satellites with it, companies are forced to go with the cheapest option. 

I agree its a false 'strategy' on the part of Germany, but the political circumstances now are far different than they ever were. As a French diplomat put it candidly, the US threat of car tariffs made Gaullists out of Transatlanticists. 

If Russia had stayed put, this may have simply meant more Soyuz rockets.

**North Korean embassy in Madrid assaulted with hostages and computer theft**

*The General Information Commissariat of the National Police investigates who is behind the action committed on Friday afternoon, in the middle of Aravaca and next to the CNI.*

Last Friday, a group of men took over the North Korean embassy in Madrid, located at 43 Darío Aparicio Street in Aravaca. The assailants handcuffed the staff of the diplomatic headquarters and remained in the building for at least four hours, according to El Confidencial de fuentes del Ministerio del Interior, a department which, however, merely points out through official channels that it maintains an investigation into the matter and that it is not going to give more information. The Diplomatic Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, consulted by this newspaper, has not replied either.

After holding the hostages for hours, a woman managed to escape from the consular compound and leave the farm, in the middle of the residential district of Aravaca. Once outside, she began to shout in Korean. It was 17:00 when the neighbors alerted the National Police, who took the complainant with them so that they could explain what had happened. An interpreter managed to translate what was said at the police headquarters and transmitted it to the agents. ""A group of men has entered the embassy and gagged the staff,"" the woman told them. It was then that the police officers who were on duty at the time sent a patrol car to the consular mansion in order to verify what the lady was saying, which claimed that she had managed to escape the assailants.

Once on the ground, the officer knocked on the door. A well-dressed man with Kim Jong-un's classic pin opened the door and told the policeman that there was no problem, that everything was ""normal"". The officer passed the information on to his superiors, who ordered him to stay there and keep a discreet watch. Minutes later, when nothing strange seemed to be happening, the gate of the consular estate opened wide. Two high-end cars came out at high speed and left the premises in a few seconds. Just a few moments later, the embassy employees who had been detained began to take to the streets. As far as the newspaper has known, the agent barely had time to identify one of the drivers as the man who had opened the door a few minutes earlier.

Since then, Friday evening, mystery surrounds many of the details of the assault. Sources from the Superior Police Headquarters of Madrid limit themselves to pointing out that that night they opened a part for injuries to a woman, presumably in reference to the official who gave an account of what was happening inside the consular headquarters. Emergencias, on the other hand, explain that the Samur's health personnel had to travel to treat three people for minor injuries related to the assault. All of them were treated in the same door of number 43 of Darío Aparicio -according to the image that accompanies this information and to which El Confidencial has had access- and discharged in the same place, so that none of them had to be transferred to any hospital. In the same image you can see the large police force, with at least seven patrol vehicles that kept the area cordoned off, although some neighbors consulted say they were up to 15.

The diplomatic legation refuses to make any statement. ""We don't have time to talk, we leave it at that,"" explains a spokesman after being consulted by El Confidencial. History, however, is corroborated by official sources. The Ministry of the Interior limits itself to pointing out that for the moment the National Police has opened an investigation in order to clarify what happened. Specifically, the same sources say that what the investigators are trying to find out is who is behind the assault, which not only held embassy personnel for hours.

The assailants who entered the consular building also took computer equipment from employees with different statuses. The police officers in charge of the enquiries - which have been taken over by the General Information Commissioner, specialised in the fight against terrorism and closely linked to the intelligence services - try to find out whether the employees miss more things, what was in those computers that was of such interest and who intended to benefit from that information. The stagecoaches, at the moment, remain secret.

The embassy is built on top of a chalet that has undergone very little alteration to adapt to a consular building, has a small backyard, is full of photos of the Kim family, with very austere decoration and is understaffed. It is located in an area of housing of the same style of high purchasing power, just four minutes by car from the headquarters of the National Intelligence Centre (NIC). Despite being enemies at the political level, diplomatic sources say that the members of the South Korean embassy are sometimes left to eat with North Koreans.

The incident investigated by the Spanish authorities took place just five days before the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, hold this Wednesday in Vietnam the second bilateral summit that addresses the disturbing nuclear program of the Asian country, one of the greatest global challenges. The two leaders arrived in Hanoi yesterday and are meeting for two days, today and tomorrow.",,/r/europe/comments/avaexb/north_korean_embassy_in_madrid_assaulted_hostages/ehdwrk2/,nocompute,1551261921

Listen, you can think whatever you want. I'm an American who has lived my entire life in America. I would say I have *some* authority on what Americans think or don't think about Europe.

Europeans are great. We like them. We like ourselves, too—generally more, or we'd be moving to Europe. And that's about it: mild positive sentiment about Europe and a preoccupation with domestic affairs is the status quo here. Americans at large really don't fetishize Europe.

Not true, read the statement by the professor who wrote it.

&gt; What the court now said is that the BfV cannot openly say that they are potentially violating the constitution before themselves have made a proper investigation in that matter.

Innocent until proven guilty. Strange that a court had to remind the Verfassungsschutz of that...

&gt;So, Maaßen still had to be fired, he was partisan, he was openly violating his duty of neutrality, and he refused to start even the pre-investigation which is still completly legal to do.

Partisan is actually the word which can be used for his successor, as it is clear that he did as ordered by the grand coalition here. Maaßen has not violated his duties, or it wouldn't have been such a headache for Merkel to get rid of him. He spoke up against her about Chemnitz and that's why he had to go.

Do you think lux nationals who live the other side of the border to commute to lux rent more often than residentials? I don't think so, I would even say that they are more likely to own the place because they get more value for their money.

Also the views of local politicians differ from the views of the higher-ups. The local politicians, who run on a county-level, are much more like normal, average people rather than true politicians leading the party and having an important say in it.

Well yes and no. The UK I think will always primarily see the EU as an economic project, whereas the whole rest of the continent considers it first and foremost a peace project.

The US and UK came out of WW2 as winners and were never occupied, never had to live though the horrors of occupation.

1242,"&gt; Arab Spring I don't know how people even brought that up but I wasn't talking about the European Refugee Crisis being a direct result of the Arab Spring, it's a result of a chain reaction beginning with the wars on Afghanistan and more importantly Iraq (which was bases on lies) and the creation of ISIS (which was another direct result of the Iraq war), evidently. I already cited sources on that topic and I'm on my mobile again.. so look it up if you want to.

The Syrian civil war started before ISIS got there. Period. There's no way in hell Assad would've put up with ISIS had the rebellion not weakened his ability to respond. A rebellion inspired by Arab Spring started in Egypt. Assad's gassing of his own people was enough to create a refugee crisis of epic proportions. You can pin a lot of what you're saying on the US, but Syria was going to become a humanitarian crisis all on its own, whether ISIS tried to capitalize on the weakened Syrian military or not.

On the Huawei issue, what evidence could the US produce that you would trust? They're alleging the devices they install in the US are full of backdoors, so would you trust that code samples and compromised hardware were indeed provided by the Chinese? Do you trust Canada? Obviously, there's enough evidence of misbehavior for Canada to arrest Meng Wanzhou for extradition to the US for sanctions violations. Not to say the US has never done bad things, but your post seems very much on the side of Huawei being some kind of sweet, innocent victim. 

Also, in spite of the Nayirah testimony, it wasn't necessary. The world was pretty much ready to smack Iraq out of Kuwait. What the Citizens for a Free Kuwait (a Kuwaiti propaganda machine, not the US) did wasn't right, but to point to that as *the* reason the world went to war with UN backing (resolution 660 was passed in August of 90, before Nayirah addressed the US Congress) is disingenuous.

Not that racism wasn't widespread, or that it was something common, but France was a bit ahead on matters like this because of the whole universalism concept of the Enlightenment.

It's all a yin and yang. And if it is all bad then may it be the arbiter for change we desperately need. 



But I found this quote pretty interesting, ""power loves vacuums.""



So after ww2 you had just one option of who was going to take over Europe,  the Soviets. But let's not focus that far back because it's easy to see American exceptionalism back then but much harder nowadays. In the near future we will see the rise of China to astronomical levels and Russia is vying for power as well. If somehow the United states does not maintain its military and economic superiority, one which can dominate any other nation and keep them in check from rising,  then you will see these other nations take over.  And frankly that is terrifying.  




For everything bad america does,  and it does a lot! it is nowhere near the level other nations would be willing to do.  China and Russia's human rights are so despicable it would be true dystopian conditions if they set the tone.  Their care and regulations for the environment are apocalyptic to say the least. 



Maybe none of it is true and they wouldn't take over,  but history would definitely suggest that if america were to fall from grace then most likely one of or both and some others would rise to power and wouldn't have a country like america to threaten them into their place.  Look at the %of NATO forces are American troops or funded by America compared to the other countries. (I'm not parroting any trump line here this has been the case for many many years)



They are kind of like the big brother who bullies you and you hate him but if someone else were to pick on you he would destroy them, and if he weren't there then a bunch of other countries would start picking on you alllll the time and there wouldn't be anything you could do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

With global warming, the easier to comprehend signs are rising temperatures and that's what the media focuses on and because of this people tend to not realize that the **unusual and really cold weather is a result of global warming**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not an expert in the field so I won't go into detail but basically there's a massive circulating stream of really cold air near the north pole during the winter, up until 2014-ish global weather and wind patterns kept this cold air locked up north, BUT global warming has affected the system that keeps this cold air north and it's starting to come down south bringing polar temperatures further south in the winter. This massive influx of polar air causes the unusually cold weather.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might think cold air coming south is a good thing but when you think big picture it's really not, this cold air needs to be locked near the poles to re-freeze ice that melted in the warmer months, the longer the cold air stays up north the more sea ice is formed. With the cold air dissipating/moving south, the less water that is turned into ice. Less ice formation  = more melting of polar ice = higher sea levels = BAD.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure comments will point out the minor flaws in my statements, but the general idea is correct; scientists disagreeing about minor details is the reason climate change deniers even have a voice.

This assumes that the Middle East wouldn't have been even more destabilized without US intervention. The Middle East wasn't some kind of wonderland before the US intervened. Saddam Hussein was a murderous dictator. The Taliban were in power. Al-Qaeda was free to plot attacks against Westerners from Afghanistan. 

The Syrian Civil War didn't start because of the United States, either directly or indirectly. It stemmed from the Arab Spring, and from a historic drought that afflicted Syria. 

&gt; Vietnam 1964 (Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the US lying about being attacked) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident

The average German doesn't know about the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. You're trying to inject your own agenda and trying to make it look like your particular personal view reflects the view of the German people in general.

&gt; Gulf War I 1990 (Nayirah, the US lying about babies in incubators) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony

The Nayirah testimony is irrelevant. The first Gulf War is widely considered by military historians and international relations specialists to be one of the best wars conducted by the United States in modern history. Iraq invaded Kuwait. We kicked them out. We didn't get embroiled in a long-term war or overextended ourselves.

It seems like you may not understand how our voting system works, and your facts are a tad off. We do not get to directly vote for the president. We have an Electoral College that is *supposed to* represent us and vote for our interests.

What happened with the Trump election was somewhat unusual... It's only happened a few other times in US history. All of them fairly recent (and perhaps not coincidentally, each time with a **Republican** candidate.) 

Basically, Trump actually **lost** the popular vote. In other words, if we had the ability to directly choose our president, Hillary Clinton would be in office right now.

But even though Clinton won the be popular vote, she magically conveniently lost the electoral vote, D-bag won the electoral, so he's our president.

Can you guess who the *last* president was who *lost* the popular vote but won the electoral? It's easy-- think of US presidents most of the world hated , who turned our country into the punchline of a sad joke, working your way backwards from Trump.

I.e. George W. Bush. 

You seeing a pattern here?

Are many of my countrymen easily misled idiots? Unfortunately yes. And yeah that's a problem, and we need to do something about it before it's too late.

On the plus side, maybe it will comfort you to know that the good ones, the sane ones, are *still* the majority in this country, as the last election actually proves.

(On that note, Clinton might've won the popular by an even larger margin if the liberal vote wasn't so split between other candidates. This is just more proof we need to rework our entire voting system, and institute some type of **ranked choice voting** -- which is one of the only hopes we have, of getting rid of this two-party insanity.)

Yes, america has a terrible history of installing contras. I am not denying that. The difference is that we have freedom of the press, free internet, and the freedom to investigate.

1460,"&gt; No - I'm right and you're quoting the dictionary wrong.

Ok, whatever.

&gt;That dictionary provides three interpretations of which you have arbitrarily picked one and omitted the other two. All three are useful and the interpretation of the concept cannot disregard these. This is called cherry-picking and just like the no true Scotsman and the ad hominem attacks, this too is unacceptable in a civil discussion.

Dictionary provides three definitions and here they are. I didn't pick arbitrarily, I picked the top one which actually defines the word. All three definitions match with my argument.

undivided rule or absolute sovereignty by a single person
2 : a nation or state having a monarchical government
3: a government having a hereditary chief of state with life tenure and powers varying from nominal to absolute

&gt;I'd also avoid using a dictionary to properly understand forms of government and their political structure, especially in the case of such a rich topic as monarchies. I'd suggest reading - for example - Encyclopedia Britannica's article. In particular, its second page could offer you some actual insight on the topic, which you could most certainly put to fruitful use.

This sub seems to take it for granted that brexit is a bad choice (and I agree), but I doubt that many of us read daily at least 30 minutes of content on matters related to UK geopolitics, economy, brexit etc. The citizens of UK are not equipped for the task of voting on brexit, just as they aren't equipped to vote on entering/leaving NATO and UN.

That's why democracy is voting on someone, rather than on something. Unless people of UK become, by some unforeseen force, aware of many aspects of choices as complex as brexit, and competent enough in manipulative tactics to recognize those used to sway their opinions, they should not be allowed to decide about it, but rather to put their trust in hands of people they have elected, as seemingly bad as they are.",,/r/europe/comments/auvk9v/new_brexit_developments_megathread/ehco7i8/,0ritfx,1551218990

That's why the Indians supported the British in the war of independence of the US because they knew that the colonies would expand West of Appalachian Mountains (When Britain forbade to the American colonies to do so) and be the first to be displaced.

The US just continued what the American colonies were doing of pushing the Indians Further West when America was adding more new states to its Union and expanding West, especially the ideological movement known as the Manifest Destiny :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny

Manifest Destiny does not say that the US needs more land because of economic necessity or for basic reasons of survival, but to acquire as much land as possible to expand American Civilization. Tribal and nomadic peoples like the Indians stood in the way of this Manifest Destiny of the American states and the solution was either to Kill them or push them continually further West as the American states continued to grow all through the 19 th century.

We can't leave them all in Irak/Syria. France is not supporting the death penalty for its citizen, no matter what they did, so leaving them to be judged and sentenced to death is not really possible. We also can't revoke their citizenship, as we signed treaties preventing us to create apatrids.

Our judicial code also prevent sentencing people to life in prison without parole or early release possible, so if we get them back, we know that they will get out someday. 

So basically, we kinda have to take them back and we know they will be released someday.

Most important reason behind this is that the Dutch part in recent years has not been sufficiently taken into account in important decisions for the entire company in recent years while  making most of the profit.  

 In Q4 the profit even came fully in the name of KLM. The Dutch achieved an operational result of 112 million euros, which is the same as a year earlier. But Air France came to a loss of 62 million euros, or a decrease of 179 million euros.

Furthermore the Dutch ministers  write, among other things, that the state has not been consulted in discussions about possible cooperation with Delta Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. Neither the Netherlands nor KLM were allowed to contribute when the French hotel group AccorHotels wanted to buy a share in Air France-KLM.

1717,"I disagree. The EU and Britain will have a relationship. While from an economic point of view it is all straightforward, the more integration the better, there are multiple other factors to look into. For example take political and demographic dimensions of Brexit.
1. Political. How will a EU-Britain relationship affect the way decision making works in the single market. Even if Britain leaves and all decisions are taken in Brussels, they are likely to influence key debates due to their size. This would be detrimental to transparency inside the EU. Also, what would a successful post-Brexit Britain mean for populist forces once the EU does its next 2015 or 2009 style fuck up.
2. Demographic. While people often ignore this, there is a negative balance of migration between the EU27 and Britain, with Britain attracting the young and the skilled from Southern and Eastern Europe. They do it in huge numbers partially due to language. While this was all fun and games until now, with the continent's demographics taking a turn for the worse, free movement might end up hurting many regions.

Rarely a day passes without Europe having to confront the extent to which it has become a hostage to three threats: the collapse of the postwar US strategic guarantee of European security; the determination of Russia to continue its policy of destabilising the liberal order; and finally the silent economic hegemony of a rising China.

The conjunction of these three factors raises the question of how, in such a context, Europe and the EU can guarantee its survival. Some will argue that the EU is not ready to meet these challenges collectively and that, as a consequence of its abdication of a leadership role, member states must play their own hands separately.

All this is undoubtedly true. But nevertheless the French view of the political autonomy of Europe and of the necessity for the EU to play the game of global power politics is gaining traction with Germany and other member states.


Take the case of industrial policy, which for a long time was identified with an old, and outdated, statist French dream. Today German politicians, including economy minister Peter Altmaier, are also speaking forcefully in favour of a serious industrial policy. In his “national industrial strategy 2030”, unveiled earlier this month, Mr Altmaier went so far as to consider the state taking stakes in strategically important companies vulnerable to falling under foreign control.

As for the BDI, Germany’s main business lobby, it recently published a report on China (described as a “systemic competitor”) which displays none of the extreme self-confidence that has long characterised German industry.

The Germans are well aware that their exceptional know-how will not be enough to counter a China that does not play by the rules and is reluctant to open its public markets to international competition.

While it was unthinkable 10 years ago, today the BDI calls for the establishment of “matching clauses, that allow the state to be used where state aid abroad distorts competition”.

The recent decision of the European Commission to block the rail merger between Alstom and Siemens may run counter to this. But, in truth, competition regulation is profoundly inadequate to the reality of the 21st century. As Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, noted recently, the aircraft manufacturer could never have come into being under today’s competition rules.

That is why it is likely that changes to EU competition rules will be on the agenda of the next European Commission. The joint manifesto setting out a European industrial policy fit for the 21st century presented last week by Mr Altmaier and his French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, is significant — not least because it is largely consistent with traditional French positions.

Admittedly, the Franco-German “engine” stumbles over obstacles such as the reform of the eurozone, which Germany is stubbornly reluctant to endorse. But there are other areas where the engine is moving forward. Take industrial co-operation in the field of defence. By choosing the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), apparently against the advice of the German air force general staff, Germany kept alive the chance of Europe having its own fourth-generation fighter from 2040.

Add to this Franco-German convergence on climate change, European trade policy, the establishment of a multilateral alliance against US President Donald Trump and more recently on the Europeanisation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to reduce Russian pressure, and we can see that things are moving forward.

Even the French idea of making the euro play a much larger international role is now part of the European debate.

To be clear, the EU will never become a great power to rival the US or China. This old French dream will never come true because there is no European people and therefore no European superstate.

What we have to focus on instead are specific areas in which the EU can exercise the greatest power. There are three such areas. The first is the entire field of global standards related to the protection of personal data, copyright, consumer rights, food, health and the environment. Here the EU can exercise what can be termed “normative power”.

The second is industrial policy and attempts to protect the European economy against the predatory behaviour of China in particular. This includes the construction of a European digital market capable of competing with the Chinese and Americans.

The third area, where pan-European co-operation is unquestionably the weakest, is security and defence. The reality of the world vindicates the French vision of global politics. It is now up to France to listen better to others, with a modesty or humility that does not come easily.

They prosecuted their Slavic citizens (Poles, Kashubs, Sorbs, Slovincians, Silesians, Masurians, etc) by either stripping their citizenship and deporting them to foreign countries or by working them to death as Serfs on Prussian landholder’s lands. 

This of course later influenced the Nazis in Generalplan Ost.

They committed a mass genocide in South Africa called the Herero and Namaqua Genocide, during which hundreds of thousands of native Africans were slaughtered. 

This of course later influenced the Nazis, yet again (are you seeing the pattern?), in their actions against people they deemed as “subhuman”.

Prussia was a villainous Empire (not unlike the other genocidal empires) and it was a burden to the reputation of many Germans, who were unfortunately associated with the brunt, nationalistic, neo-totalitarian state. 
Good riddance that it was put down, like the vile creation that it was.

1869,"&gt; Were Denmark or Austria colonial countries? Did Ireland exploit the thirld world? 

you don't need to have colonies in order to take part in global capitalism, which is inherently exploitative.

&gt;  Why did every eastern block country drop communism like a bad habit  as soon as they didnt fear soviet invasion? 

this has nothing to do with ""soviet invasion"" but with economic pressure. you see the ""communist block"" (never called themselves communist btw) also was a common economic and trade zone, the Comecon, which collapsed after the Ussr was overthrown. Imagine every country in the EU would become socialist except, say Portugal, it wouldn't be able to stand the economic pressure of the greater powers around it and would collapse or become socialist aswell. in that scenario we could have this discussion, just the other way around and I would maybe be the smug asshole saying ""see capitalism doesn't work"".

&gt; So why did the soviet union dissolve after 50 years?

There are many possible approaches to this question, i would argue that the socialist experiment of 1917 started to degenerate in an ideological sense after 1919 and especially after 1924. 

Economically the Revisionist policies of Kruschev and the reintroduction of the profit motive aswell as the utter destruction brought by ww2 crippled the ussr for too long.

In terms of foreign policy Gorbachev really gave them the rest.

I would say that the combination of these issues made the Ussr to weak to resist outside pressure and thus collapse.

&gt; And lol @the 'perks' the poor had. Though I have to admit communism did succeed on the equality front - it made everyone equally in the shit. 

well Today's russia is far away from the standard of living of the ussr.

the ussr was the first country to introduce the 40 hour week, putting pressure on the west to adopt the same, there is a good document by the CIA which details how the standard of Nutrition was better in the Ussr than in the US with roughly the same amount of calories consumed but better food quality wise. [https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84B00274R000300150009-5.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84B00274R000300150009-5.pdf)

So saying that standard of living was anything less than decent and acceptable would in my opinion be wrong, I agree that there was little luxury, but this standard of living is yet to be achieved for \*everybody\* in most capitalist countries.

But given two alternative possibilities (not implying there arent others):

- UK is exceptionalist and has a superiority complex, and 27 other nations are fed up with its behavior
- UK isn't exceptionalist and doesn't have a superiority complex. Its just an opinion somehow shared by people in the other 27 EU countries. It is propaganda, and not joining the Euro and demanding rebates on membership fees are totally a coincidence.

Pressure from the US Ambassador to Berlin, the desperate defence of the German Foreign Minister, the surprising declaration by the French - these are just some of the events that determine the current tense situation around Nord Stream 2.

This is a calendar of events that affect the political dispute over Nord Stream 2.

Romania has held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union since the beginning of 2019. The country has significantly accelerated its work on the revision of the Gas Directive, which is likely to reduce the profitability of the Nord Stream 2 project. Previously, this work was blocked by Austria, which has recently shown an exceptionally pro-Russian attitude. 

In the first days of January, the German media published a letter from US ambassador Richard Grenell in Berlin, which was addressed to companies from Germany involved in the Nord Stream 2 project. The diplomat warned these entities about possible sanctions from the US and stressed the significant risk of image losses.

Shortly after the Grenella letter was made public, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that even if the U.S. would impose sanctions on western Nord Stream 2 companies, ""Russia will implement it itself, and then no one will be able to influence the maintenance of gas transit through Ukraine"".

As early as mid-January, the Council of the European Union dealt with the amendment of the Gas Directive. The project has been enriched with Romanian proposals concerning, among other things, the rules of negotiating agreements on the subjection of projects to EU law. According to the media, according to the new wording of the regulations, possible talks between Germany and Russia on Nord Stream 2 would have to be authorised by the European Commission.

On 22nd January the deputy head of the European Commission, Marosz Szefczowicz said that he was ""counting on the acceleration of work on the gas directive"".

From 23rd to 25th January Minister Heiko Maas stayed in the United States, where he talked with US Secretary of State Mik Pompeo about Nord Stream 2, among others.

During the World Economic Forum in Davos, which took place from 22nd to 25th January, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the development of her country's economy requires large amounts of gas, which she intends to buy from Russia.

At the end of January the German TV station RTL published a survey, which indicated that as many as 73% of Germans support the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. 16% of German citizens were against it.

At the turn of January and February Vladimir Chizhov, Russia's permanent representative to the European Union, said that ""there are no insurmountable obstacles to the Nord Stream 2 project.

At the beginning of February Rainer Seele, president of the Austrian company OMV, which is involved in the Nord Stream 2 project, admitted that his company had already invested 600 million euros in the project. ""We are confident that the Nord Stream 2 project will continue because it has been approved by European governments,"" said Seele.

On 6th February a meeting took place between Secretary Mike Pompeo and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. Issues such as ""the fight against Russian destabilisation measures"" or ""regional energy security"" were on the agenda.

During the night of 6-7 February, the German media began to report on the clarification of France's position on the revision of the gas directive. According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, Paris announced its intention to vote against the Nord Stream 2 project at a meeting of EU ambassadors on Friday, February 8. These reports were confirmed by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressing, however, that France is ready to work with its partners - and in particular with Germany - on a possible new wording of the amendment. These reports were surprising not only because of the breakthrough of the Nord Stream 2 agreement on the Paris-Berlin axis, which has grown into the role of the tandem governing the European Union. Hitting this controversial project could harm the interests of Engie, the French company that is involved in the project.

At virtually the same time, American ambassadors in Germany, Denmark and the European Union appealed to European countries about the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. They write in it that this connection will increase Russia's ability to influence the EU. ""This scenario is dangerous for the whole West"". - The diplomats emphasized.

After 7 February, the Chairman of the Bundestag's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Norbert Roettgen, admitted that ""France is right on Nord Stream 2, not Germany"".

In the evening of 7 February the German journalist Julian Roepcke wrote on Twitter that, according to his sources, the German government is putting pressure on France and Romania to change the outcome of the Nord Stream 2 vote.

According to MEP Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, Germany can count on the support of the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Greece and Cyprus. The votes of the largest countries, such as France, Italy and Spain, are crucial.


EU politicians who want to push through regulations that are unfavourable to Nord Stream 2 have to take into account the time constraint - the upcoming elections to the European Parliament. The last session of the current EP is scheduled for 18 April. Until then, the Parliament may approve the draft amendment prepared and agreed in the Council (although this will require time-consuming translations, among other things).

&gt; In the end though, Greece is a sovereign nation and is thus fully responsible for all decisions made before the debt crisis became unmanageable.

Greece was never a sovereign nation. We were always controlled by Russians, Americans or Europeans. Please search our history and you will see that the modern greek nation is in debt from the beginning of it in the 1820's. Our first ruler was from Bavaria, Otto of Greece, our flag has the same colors like a bavarian one. Greece was never a unified population but we were City-nations up until then. We were all unified as ""the descendents of the ancient greeks"" from Germans. I am not sure many of people know it but in Munich there is the Propylaea, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylaea_(Munich) It evokes the monumental entrance of the Propylaea for the Athenian Acropolis. The gate was created as a memorial for the accession to the throne of Otto of Greece, a son of the principal King Ludwig I of Bavaria.

So... yeah... not really a sovereign state.

And to answer your question about being dick or not... I am pretty sure you are not a dick in real life but to assume that the greeks are responsible for their actions ALONE and that they were not dragged into it then you are clearly out of the loop. Yes we have corruption, yes we are responsible for this mess but we are not the only ones to blame for the situation.

From the article above.... ""Politics also helped Greece join the euro in 2001. Although it was not until 2004 that Athens admitted entry figures had been fudged, the dodgy numbers were an open secret in Brussels. Many other countries were doing the same, albeit on a smaller scale. Only later when Greece buckled under the weight of its debts did European grandees say it had been “a mistake” to allow Greece to join the currency.""",,/r/europe/comments/auxtfg/pension_spending_by_country/ehbj7s9/,CryptoNoob-BRLN,1551189891

What I'm saying is the consequences won't be catastrophic and that some sources present the exit unrealistically.

I haven't got a personal essay to present. You can find both more positive and more pessimistic predictions online. You can side with the ones you find more believable.

The Eurozone crisis was mainly an internal problem of the Eurozone countries and had started developing before the Lehman Brothers collapse. It has to do with the high debts of certain Eurozone members which were not the result of the 2007-2008 crisis.

I think even with a no deal the imposed tariffs can be absorbed by the UK without derailing its economy to a point of no return. I'm not sure about other non financial aspects of a no deal though. I have to look more into it.

Not sure where you're going with that. If they came back to France, they would be *judged* there, and likely condemned to prison. About 10 years in the cases that have already happened if I trust the various news articles. ""These people"" know the legal systems of the West, well yeah like any other French citizen basically.

On the other hand, I think **you** do not know it, reading things like ""most ISIS returnees will only get a slap on the wrist"" because that's just not what happens? Where can you find any evidence of a light sentence for an ISIS returnee to France? Unless you count eight years in prison as light.

I think you are weakening the justice of our countries by spreading lies about its inaction and somehow glorifying the summary justice used in recovering war zones as if it were preferable.

Saying you are ok with the death penalty is fine, saying you don't understand why a country would prefer to judge its own citizens for crimes committed abroad is perfectly understandable, but lying about how returnees are condemned?

&gt;During the 1870s and early 1880s European nations such as Great Britain, France, and Germany began looking to Africa for natural resources for their growing industrial sectors as well as a potential market for the goods these factories produced. As a result, these governments sought to safeguard their commercial interests in Africa and began sending scouts to the continent to secure treaties from indigenous peoples or their supposed representatives. Similarly, Belgium’s King Leopold II, who aspired to increase his personal wealth by acquiring African territory, hired agents to lay claim to vast tracts of land in central Africa. To protect Germany’s commercial interests, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who was otherwise uninterested in Africa, felt compelled to stake claims to African land.

2306,"&gt;Is this flying too close?



That article is about a different incident involving a British airplane. 


&gt;I mean, if flying within 20m is unsafe then both sides are flying in an unsafe manner.



The Swedish airplane was flying perfectly safely, it was the Russian one that approached it.



&gt;Since the SU-27 managed to taxi, depart the Kaliningrad air strip and reach the Swedish spy plane it is obvious that the plane was quite close.



The SU-27 can fly 2,500 km/h. So no, it didn't need to be close. The SU-27 could easily have flown to the area between Gotland and Latvia. 


But I don't understand why you keep whining about airplanes being close to Kaliningrad. Everyone is allowed to fly in international airspace, and there's no illegal zone surrounding Russia.


&gt;If the Swedes think this is dangerous the simple solution is - don't fly spy planes close to the Russian border.

2338,"Several air pollutants contribute to the acidification of the environment. The most important ones are the gases sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and ammonia (NH3). Their impact can be observed in the progressive degradation of soils, water and forests. They also contribute to the formation of fine particles in the air that cause respiratory diseases. The acidifying potential of these pollutants is commonly measured in SO2 equivalents.

Between 2008 and 2016, the total emissions of acidifying gases emitted by European Union (EU) businesses and households decreased by 6.3 million tonnes of SO2 equivalents, which represents a reduction of 26 %. Over this period, emissions of sulphur dioxide fell by 55 %, nitrogen oxides by 25 %, and ammonia by 1 %.

Agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed 43 % of the total acidifying gas emissions in 2016 (mostly ammonia), while transportation and storage accounted for 20 % (mostly nitrogen oxides) and manufacturing 11 %.

The electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply industry contributed 10 % towards total acidifying gas emissions in 2016. Since 2008 there has been a drop of 2.6 million tonnes of SO2 equivalents in this sector, due to the more systematic use of end-of-pipe pollution filters, and the introduction of more efficient combustion technology in the electricity and heat production.

Households accounted for 10 % of the total emissions of acidifying gases in 2016 (predominantly nitrogen oxides).",,/r/europe/comments/auvz47/air_pollutants_decreases_in_emissions_in_2016/ehayr70/,B0etius02,1551161470

That's what would be truly democratic!

Democracy doesn't start and end at the voting booth. The public debate, the technicalities, and especially the mandate are equally important, and that's where the first referendum has failed on every level. Honestly, the only democratic thing about the first referendum was the free vote. Everything else about that referendum went terribly wrong, and the Brexit clusterfuck only happened because of the fundamental flaws in the first referendum.

Therefore I find it absurd and outright disingenuous that British politicians deny a second referendum because they are worried about ""social cohesion"" and ""democratic principles"". These principles were the first thing that flew out of the window when Cameron announced a referendum that they did not want, that they did not intend to execute in case of a negative outcome, that had no requirements for a qualified mandate, and that reduced a big and complex question to binary vote that has ripped the social cohesion.",,/r/europe/comments/auo0a4/labour_announce_backing_for_a_second_brexit/ehaud0y/,sverebom,1551156698

The Holocaust started in a country in which the Jewish community was arguably the most assimilated in Europe. Hell, in pretty much all of Western Europe, that was the case. They were neighbors, they were industrialists, they were businessmen – and they spoke French and German more often than Yiddish.

Tactical voting is king. In the UK you vote for the party that will keep the party you like least out, unless there seems to be a large shift to a specific third party. 

Yes, Remainers *could* have voted for the Lib Dems, but without some ridiculous levels of coordination the most likely outcome of people individually deciding to do that would have been swing seats going to the Tories, and the Tories getting an outright majority. 

The problem was the Lib Dems had absolutely no momentum behind them. They failed to build a credible alternative, their leader was a wet blanket with no charisma, and they decided to replace him with a fossil, a wise and respectable one, but a fossil none the less.

* Fuck knows who trying to kill my uncle with a car was never punished

* Romanian teachers denying university access for my dirty mongol mom and aunt were never punished

Accurate. Though it's still a wondrous thing to behold that nobody in his administration seems to have any clue as to why that is. 

The *EU* as an institution doesn't bend as easily as other counterparts because the people running it don't have a stake in these things. The EU could care less if, say, a few thousand French farmers were biting the dust or if 20,000 German auto workers lose their jobs. The jobs *in Brussels* don't depend on them, and neither does Brussels get anything out of retaining them since Brussels doesn't get any taxes. The *member states* do. 

The EU does, however, cash in the tariffs, since tariffs are its only *direct* source of revenue. Institutionally, the EU is much more inclined to ramp up tariffs in response to external threats than be cowed by the prospect of having them around. 

I suppose nobody in Washington has figured that out because most of the people a working in an administration which tends to maximise short-term leverage at the expense of long-term thinking.

2782,"&gt;American here

I'm from West Wales, one of the poorest regions in Northern Europe. I lived my life in one of the most deprived communities in the UK, and watched as dozens of primary schools in my area got shut down because of Conservative austerity measures resulting in insufficient funding.

My school's sixth form (pre university education) was spared, but two others in the area were shut down  to free up funding for mine to stay open.

My local hospital, the only one in a 50 mile radius, was under threat of being shut down for the last decade due to ""insufficient funding"".

This isn't an unusual story. There are hundreds of communities like mine that likely won't survive the economic hit intact. It's only because of EU funding that these places actually managed to persist, and Westminster certainly won't step in to help these places. The money will continue to drain into places like London, Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester, and the rest will be left as ""acceptable losses"".

That's what Brexit will mean for the first 10 years. You'll see a lot of very unhappy people.


As for the EU... American independence was nothing like the British relationship with the EU.
Britain held an esteemed position in the Union, it had exceptions made for it at many turns.
It's outside the Euro, outside of the Schengen area (we have passport and border control), the UK held enormous respect from Europe, and a great deal of authority - only Germany really topped it because of its economy.

The EU isn't an empire, and the treaties that bind the UK were signed by choice - hence why it has the power to leave via article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.

And if you'll allow me a little leeway on language here, but the UK has an area a bit less than that of Michigan. The US when they declared independence had an ***ENTIRE FUCKING CONTINENT***.

1) For example in Poland you could ask question about citizens of Khazakstan, descendants of Poles that was expelled by communists and are for example orthodox christian (non-catholic if you would like to use religion factor). So - they are Poles by blood, but by different religion.

2) If you would like to conduct comparable poll as this one from OP in Israel, than you should choose people that are not connected to Jews by heritage or religion. Like for example goim.

2887,"&gt;Well, as it happens, emission standards are gradually tightening and many cities are imposing standards that make it effectively impossible to enter cities with old diesels. No doubt that will continue until it's effectively impossible to enter the city with a combustion engine. 

No, that is not the same as what I was saying. Let me reiterate:

Speeding kills a shitton in Europe. Cars that can go over 80km should be banned for the general public to drive. Motorcycles are too dangerous and should be banned (just drive a regular car or take public transport.)

&gt;Tolerance for alcohol is also tightening also, but less so, as the damage is mostly self-inflicted.

You greatly downplay the effect of alcohol in crime in Europe. [Alcohol consumption in Europe has a correlation to homicide rates.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11228080)

&gt;Unlike guns, those are explicitly designed to inflict damage on others.

Design does not trump usage. Just because something is ""designed to kill"" does not mean that usage and ownership of that item will always result in more deaths than something designed *not* to kill. As I have previously stated, legal guns in Europe are rarely used in crime. The overwhelming majority of weapons used in the commission of a crime are illegal and sourced from Eastern Europe.

&gt;If you want to do target shooting for fun, you still can.

Except this directive bans the most commonly owned gun and magazine in Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Hence why the opposition. To justify this and say, ""weeeell you can still own and shoot bolt-action rifles at a gun range"" is stupid. This is a massive infringement on rights.

You want to know how many of these rifles and magazines are used in homicides in Switzerland for example a year? **One.** There was literally one rifle murder in Switzerland last year and the SG 550 is the most commonly owned gun there.

&gt;Yeah, that must be why Switzerland only let women vote in 1971. For reference, that's later than all of Africa and the Middle East except two countries. Valuing liberties has nothing to do with it.

And Switzerland is still freer than the Netherlands. Funny how that works out!

&gt;Likewise I could say that you always oppose any regulation.

No? You clearly have zero clue about the gun community in Europe. Almost nobody is asking for US-style regulations. The EU has tightened the laws multiple times in the past, and Switzerland had to abide in 2008 when it joined Schengen. Gun owners accepted all those regulations. The opposition to this is two-fold:

This directive bans certain types of guns and magazines that are the most commonly owned guns in certain countries. 

The justification for this directive (the 2015 Paris attacks) and terrorism is extremely poor. As I have stated, the vast majority of guns used in the commission of a day-to-day crime or in terrorist attacks in the EU come from Eastern Europe, **not legally-held firearms or stolen from legal owners.** Rather than enforcing border controls as to stop the smuggling of these weapons, it goes after legal owners instead.

To use opposition against this directive and claim that gun owners must surely oppose any regulation is absurd. 

&gt;Switzerland has a higher total gun death rate, even if you leave out the suicides, which make up the bulk of gun deaths.

Only if you use outdated statistics.

**There were a total of 14 gun homicides during 2017 in Switzerland:** https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/aktuell/neue-veroeffentlichungen.assetdetail.4842629.html

**That comes out to a rate of 0.16 per 100,000 people.**

**According to the official statistical office of the Netherlands there were 46 gun homicides in 2017**: https://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLEN&amp;PA=81453ENG&amp;D1=0,4&amp;D2=a&amp;D3=a&amp;D4=17-21&amp;LA=EN&amp;HDR=T,G2&amp;STB=G1,G3&amp;VW=T

**That comes out to a rate of 0.26 per 100,000 people.**

So yes, the NL has a higher gun and overall homicide rate according to the latest statistics.

&gt;The people who favor restrictions on guns also favor general access to euthanasia, and that's what guns are actually used for. So what's the problem?

No? Guns are used for sporting and hunting all the time in Europe. These types of guns and magazines are the most popular type of gun in sporting in Switzerland and the CZ. I'm not sure about hunting in those two nations but I know guns like an AR are even legal for hunting in Germany and used to control boar populations.

2920,"Except language doesn't deprecate in a logical or functional manner. Language is a constantly evolving shibboleth, because it's main purpose is establishing a personal connection. Learning a new language, I am constantly surprised that old forms of the language make more sense and are more consistant than modern usage, as arbitrary changes were made through use.

Language simply doesn't carry ideas, or any information whatsoever, otherwise this divergence would constantly break it's contact with reality. Instead it's just a dictionary for an internal reality of the speakers, who cludge together meaning through complex exterior references and shared experiences. 

This exercise in ""triangulating meaning and ideas"" is the goal of communication, not an inherent property. So there is no value in ""one language"", no matter how complex or feature rich it is, because it's only as good as the internal world of the speakers. Add a second or a third, and suddenly you're relearning the ""triangulation"" scheme without those early years of development and association to help. 

When another language introduces a new concept, without the speakers having any ""bookmark"" for it, it's not just like updating a function, it start turning into a moment of introspection as you begin forming the concept from scratch starting from basic principle. When a translation doesn't ""quite"" translate, you learn specific variations in meaning that your own phrasing hid.

The rest of Europe isn’t the only region that the UK has a trade deficit with, it also has one with East Asia. RO Europe is the region that the UK does the most trade with because it is the closest to it which is the trend across the world. The EU offers a more comprehensive trading arrangement than any trade deal currently does, not only do things like the single market/customs union that effectively remove all barriers, that would normally exist between those countries but also the EU currently has 35 major trade agreements, with more planned on its way as well as many other smaller agreements. There is also advantage to negotiating such trade deals as a bloc rather than individually as it gives it more clout on a global stage, making it a more lucrative market than if they were to stand in their own and contrary to popular belief, it isn’t that hard to get everyone to agree. 

But if the UK left without a deal and falling back onto WTO terms, it would lose all of that and be back to square one. With the UK being seen as another competitor to the UK and not being seen as lucrative or have as much clout as the EU. As such there would be less incentive to offer such a comprehensive trade deal than the EU might get.

2985,"&gt; How is a picture of Soros displayed as a puppet master ""legitimate critique""?

I agree it's not legitimate, it's obviously propaganda, but it's not anti-semitic regardless of it's legitimacy as critique.

&gt;Then why does it target only one (jewish) individual that doesn't even  live in Europe, and not any rich people that actually live here or any  of the multinational corporations that spend a lot more to lobby in  Europe? 

Because OSF is directly funded and controlled by Soros unlike most NGOs which get their money from membership fees. OSF targets the broader ideology of European policy directly unlike corporations which mostly targets specific regulations to earn more profits. Corporations usually answer to dozens if not thousands of shareholders as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But I'm also not buying your argument that you can simply buy influence  in the EU by spending more money, which is what you seem to imply. This  may be how US politics works, but the EU parliament is functioning a lot  better than that. 

It's hard to know what we don't know, though I agree it might be harder to buy influence in the EU. Soros hasn't registered himself in the EU lobby register, but we could infer from some simple Google searches he has better access to top politicians than most CEOs or NGO presidents.

Latin Americans, Ibero-Americans, Native-Americans, South-Americans, North-Americans, Central-Americans...

They all have the term American literally in the name. Yet they can't call themselves American without being shat on by US-Americans. 

&gt;No one in North or South American continents would refer to themselves as ""American"".

Yes, they do. This is why it is controversial in the first place. People from the Americas want to call themselves American and for the term American to not always default to the USA. 

&gt; We just refer to ourselves by the country we are from.

Not always. Not in every context. Sometimes you want to talk about the continental history and a continental identity. 

For Americans and Canadians this continental identity is about North America, but from most of the American landmass, the continental identity doesn't refer to North America or South America or the Americas, but about America, the continent.

Now, whether it's a continent or not, it doesn't matter. What it matters is that the demonym is American. And some people want and do use it. 

&gt; In fact, American is less vague. It means only the United States of America.

This is factually incorrect and flat out wrong: 

See: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/American

Feel free to look it up on any other dictionary to find the same. 

&gt;If you wanted to use your continent names for generalised regions you would use the decidedly more open ended North American, South American, or [someone from the] Americas rather than simply American.

No, ***you*** would. There are people who wouldn't. 

Again, why do you think this is controversial at all if you can't even comprehend that there are people out there who hold different points of view?

As such it's an ideological rhetoric to border itself off from political institutions that do not partake in the EU (as is done in OP's post), and to deflect any kind of criticism: Criticism of EU politics becomes criticism of European values, and can therefore be disregarded.

3268,"&gt; when y’all are saying we are an occupation force.

You are, if I go by the aggressive, thinly veiled threats jingoist Americans make when Europeans/Germans wonder aloud if it is time for Americans to leave their bases.

This reaction/attitude alone shows the true motivations behind those bases: not protection, but primarily hegemonic power projection for their own national interest.

&gt; So we have them by the nuts. 

No, that expression doesn't fit your description. Maintaining a status quo for reasons of reaping tangible mutual benefits doesn't entail a situation of blackmail or complying under duress, as you imply.

&gt; They certainly got us with the election stuff, but honestly Trump won because of our own fucked up polarization in politics.

Roughly half the country votes one tribe, the other half the other tribe. Republicans can also win when in the minority, due to the Electoral College, where the rural yokels' vote is simply worth more than a vote from a Californian or New Yorker.

Trump won a fw battleground states by slim margins. If you then add up all the Russian attacks, which were: (a) aggressive social media targeting, including illegal impersonation, even organising fake rallies using Trump campaign data and riling up racial tensions, (b) front door propaganda through Russia Today and Sputnik News, (c) back door propaganda through conspiratorial far-right media/advocacy entities likely manipulated by Russian intelligence, such as Infowars, Zero Hedge, The_Donald and the NRA (d) cyberwarfare against the DNC, DCCC and Podesta and (e) election hacking of voter rolls, possibly resulting in illegal purges, then it's quite plausible Russian interference tipped the balance.

That, and Comey's announcement of reopening the Hillary investigation are known factors.

Apparently popular democratic will mean little when it goes against the great American big brother.

&gt; they do fuck all, because life is pretty good within the pax America world

I don't know if you've noticed, but the E.U. has been savaging American multinationals attempting to strongarm European markets and diplomatic relations are at an all-time low due to the lunacy of the Trump administration, which is doing more to damage NATO than Putin by himself ever could.

There is no ""pax America [sic]"" but *bellum Americana* at the moment. The American government is beholden to the same enemy they claim to be protecting us from. In case you didn't get this through your head the last time I explained it: unless and until the Americans rectify the GRU national security failure they allowed to occur, rendering control of the U.S. nuclear arsenal to a deranged, Kremlin-controlled loon, they have no business lecturing about any sort of protective umbrella. The United States are a danger right now, not a protection. Trump and the GOP have treated Europe, Canada, Mexico, and so on as geopolitical enemies while extolling the virtues of violent totalitarian or authoritarian regimes like North Korea, Russia and Turkey.

And the Ottoman empire was very much a continuation of that Empire, the Justinian Code was still the basis of their legal system (with only a few modifications to accomodate sharia law, and even those were applied only to Muslims). After conquering Constantinople the Sultan assumed the title of ""Emperor of the Romans”. And before the conquests into the Arab nations the ""Ottoman empire"" Had roughly the same borders as the Roman empire it replaced. Same laws, same taxes even the language replacement went slow, as in the beginning most administration was still done in Greek.

For all intents and purposes the ottoman Empire was the ""Byzantine"" Empire which was the (East) Roman Empire. It just changed Religions.

In a way the Roman Empire ended only 100years ago.

The only thing I see a bit critical here is to make it one large extension. Splitting it up into multiple smaller would help to keep some leverage in case UK starts to intentionally mess up processes within the EU. It would also keep the he pressure up for UK to actually look for a solution, and the threat enterprises real to continue preparation for no-deal Brexit.

Currently money from EU is still to good to ignore it. No party would advocate leaving.

First economy calculations -weather or not leave EU - might appear in 7 years - and in 14 years it will be legitimate agenda of some parties (POlish GDP would be much higher - and money from EU would decreese significantly - making it much smaller amount).

All depends on if in people minds benefits outweight problems.

Right now for most people situation looks like we get money and in return some liberal politicians get to shout at us how evil our ways are and how backwater our beliefs are. 

If the stream of money lessens - and pressure to change Poles would intensify in the coming years - the people voting ""to leave"" might increase in number.

But we still have some years untill then.

Right now - no party would support it.

I'm arguing against the idea that the Norsemen assimilated into Frankish culture. They in fact merged with Gallo-Frankish culture in the region and created the unique mix known as Norman.

&gt;Yes, and Normans were a Christian, French-speaking vassal people of the King of France. Not Vikings, their name being just an indication of their past ancestry at this point.

Their entire culture was a mix of Norse and Frankish. Their actions and behaviour show without a doubt that they remembered where they came from. All of a sudden this pointless little Frankish region that wasn't renowned for anything became a great military power after Norsemen settled the region and intermixed with the locals.

3575,"&gt;	Because many Americans then show their nasty, aggressive face:

oh boy good thing germany only produces the finest moral minds right? nobody from germany has ever said anything nasty or aggressive towards another country i guess. please dont get your panties in a twist over every mean comment dude, you can go to any thread in this sub remotely related to the US and its constant shit talk so relax.

&gt;Other than that, German leadership post-WWII has shown enormous amounts of forbearance regarding American abuse of its military/intelligence position and status within Germany, despite strong popular German discontent with American foreign policy.

well the first 50 years of that consisted of us being the only reason germany wasnt part of the USSR so id hope you show some forbearance for that. despite all the strong discontent with not being a satellite to one of the most brutal nations in history

&gt;	Germany should and hopefully will start to invest more in their own defense apparatus

lol

&gt;	It’s a dilemma: Germany needs to radically expand its military apparatus to provide for its own defense without American assistance, but the German population is generally philosophically disinclined to become a military powerhouse again. However, Trump’s recent antics present an urgent and compelling case for Germany to go its own way.

yeah germany isnt gonna do shit about its military situation (abysmal btw) until they face a ‘real and present threat’ which is what you see parroted around here 24/7. problem is modern war doesnt have a fun little build up period before it starts and you cant exactly churn out 5th generation jets and aircraft carriers like p-51 mustangs like the good ol days. in a modern war with precision strikes and long range missiles, you fight with what you got on day one. and if you dont have the airforce to defend industrial centers you’re double fucked. if you think their going to give up the nice deal they have with the US over one shitty administration you havent been paying attention. germans lack the fundamental will to have a strong military, its a disadained career choice in their society and looked at as only a tool for imperialism. which is cool, but dont pretend you’re adding anything to everyones collective defense with a laughable military. 

&gt;	The balance of variables in this geostrategic situation is going to tilt in favour of Germany becoming militarily self-sufficient at some point, and asking the Americans to wind down and leave. However, it’s difficult to predict when this will be, without a change in German popular sentiment, because German popular sentiment is negatively inclined towards American military interventions for the same reasons it is disinclined to radically invest in its own defense.

the balance of variables has been there for decades, they run a surplus practically every year, its not that they dont have the funds or the right situation, they just lack the politcal and societal will to do it. and again, theres nothing wrong with that. just dont pretend you’re not getting a free meal ticket when you’re an export oriented economy that relies on the open sea lanes the US navy provides when you literally dont have a blue water fleet, for example.

It was inappropriate, tactless, undiplomatic and factually incorrect. The Americans have fuck all ""by the nutsack"", and if the Germans actually tell you to leave, you will, and you will do nothing to stop them. 

If ""truth"" is something you value, then the fact of the matter is that the Kremlin has **you lot** by the nutsack, and his vile, deranged, corrupt, traiterous puppet has control over your nuclear arsenal.

Trump even went so far as to **physically assault** the PM of Montenegro at a NATO summit in Wales, and then insinuating Montenegro wasn't worth fighting for as a NATO partner and could cause world war 3. 

Trump's soft coup d'état using the assistance of Russian intelligence is the biggest security failure in NATO history regarding Russia. Americans are in no position whatsoever to lecture anyone on Russi or defense until they remove Putin's puppet from the Oval Office. The Americans utterly failed to degend their most important asset: their democracy and the position of their commander-in-chief.

&gt; You guys repeat over and over that NSA uses american military bases to spy on europeans. Why keep them at all then.

Because the mass surveillance, while pioneered by the Five Eyes, has expanded to Nine and Fourteen Eyes, which includes Germany, who are both partner and target. European authorities are both victims of FVEY intrusions *and* complicit in mass surveillance. The Snowden Leaks affirm this partner/target pattern, and German leadership would like to maintain access to this apparatus. This is a long and distinct debate with plenty of blame to go around. 

&gt; Even still, they persist in wanting american military bases to remain in germany especially merkel.

""They"" meaning German people? Because this is factually quite dubious. A plurality of Germans wants the Americans to leave. And I quite deliberate made a distinction between people and leadership.

&gt; 42 percent of Germans would be happy if the US pulled its troops out of the Bundesrepublik. At the same time 37 percent said they want the US soldiers to stay, while 21 percent gave no answer.

&gt;""Space is very interesting to the defence sector,"" he said, ""because defence begins with reliable information and satellites that listen, observe, measure, and transmit. That's why defence is the key focus of all the world's major space powers today, with the notable exception of Europe.""

Other than that, German leadership post-WWII has shown enormous amounts of forbearance regarding American abuse of its military/intelligence position and status within Germany, despite strong popular German discontent with American foreign policy.

This was due to a mixture of WWII-guilt and Cold War geostrategy. However, perhaps this will change in the future, given America's clear unreliability and instability as a partner.

Germany should and hopefully will start to invest more in their own defense apparatus, and eventually a request to leave might become a tenable political position. However, this is Germany and these things move very slowly, even when dealing with an abominable clusterfuck/dumpster fire like the Trump admin.

It's a dilemma: Germany needs to radically expand its military apparatus to provide for its own defense without American assistance, but the German population is generally philosophically disinclined to become a military powerhouse again. However, Trump's recent antics present an urgent and compelling case for Germany to go its own way.

The balance of variables in this geostrategic situation is going to tilt in favour of Germany becoming militarily self-sufficient at some point, and asking the Americans to wind down and leave. However, it's difficult to predict when this will be, without a change in German popular sentiment, because German popular sentiment is negatively inclined towards American military interventions for the same reasons it is disinclined to radically invest in its own defense.",,/r/europe/comments/au7vq3/comparison_of_german_italian_and_japanese_sof/eh7wqp1/,LimbsLostInMist,1551062906

3791,"&gt; Russia could steam roll you in 1 month without U.S. defense. You aren’t even a nuclear power. I’m also sure Ukraine thought Russia wasn’t a threat.  

What a load of absolute chicken-shit balls. The Russian Federation is not the USSR. Russia doesn't *want* to steam-roll anyone, doesn't *need* to steam-roll anyone, and (more fundamentally) is no longer *able* to steam-roll anyone.  

All EU nations are signatories to the CSDP - the Common Security and Defence Policy. That means that an attack against one is an attack against all. So 'Russia' (or whoever) would not be at war with just Germany; it would be at war against 27(+1) separate nations at once, with a combined pool of over 500 nuclear warheads, a peacetime military strength of 1.5 million men, and a peacetime military budget of €200bn per year.  

This also means that 'Russia' would have to actively occupy the *entire European continent* to affect their 'steam-roll'. That means rolling their way across some of the biggest rivers in the world, through some of the biggest conurbations in the western hemisphere, through terrain varying from flat temperate plains to massive forests, from the Arctic circle to the Mediterranean, from island nations to the friggin' *Alps*.  

They would have to do this while policing, feeding, watering, and providing basic sanitation to a population base of over 510 million people. Who won't like them very much. All of which is ignoring the fact that the Russian people themselves are much more intertwined with European affairs (and Europeans themselves) than previous generations. So they might have a thing or two to say about it as well.  

The EU, as with the US and China, is essentially unconquerable by the traditional definition of 'conquering'. You have to either wipe them out, or leave them alone. The military, communicative, and administrative technology and structures simply do not exist for any nation - particularly any *single* nation - to wage war against these powers and to summarily defeat their armies and subjugate their populations. Even when superpowers go to war against comically inferior foes (the US in Afghanistan and Iraq, the RF in Syria), those fights were no 'steam-rolls'. Sure, the standing armies were wiped out, but even in Iraq where the US were 'liberators', the last troops (officially) didn't leave till 2011 - 8 *years* after invading. They invaded Afghanistan in 2001 - *18 years ago* - and only last month decided to withdraw 'in return for Taliban promises that Afghan territory will not be used by terrorists' (which is fucking laughable).  

Anyone claiming Russia wants to invade Europe is also ignoring the historical fact that Russia doesn't give two flying shits about Europe. It wants to be left alone, and it wants non-threatening countries around it to do so. It doesn't need our natural resources, it doesn't need our people, and our wealth is electronic.

Nope. The idea of de-industrializing Germany so it could no longer be a threat survived Roosevelt, and even began to be implemented in the immediate aftermath of occupation. Plants were shuttered and industrial districts demolished to keep industrial production at low, predetermined levels.

However, it was quickly realized that this situation was not in the interests of the Western Allies. Artificial delay to reconstruction proved unpopular, helping to fuel already strong pro-communist sentiments; it also created shortages which the Allied occupation government was forced to remedy. Most important of all, it was soon realized that German industry and manpower would be essential to any future confrontation with the USSR in Europe. Thus the de-industrialization plans were scrapped and replaced with plans to rebuild Germany and other occupied countries.",Finno-Autistic,/r/europe/comments/au7vq3/comparison_of_german_italian_and_japanese_sof/eh7l49g/,Alpha-Senpai,1551052944

3826,"First, obviously, everything below is my subjective opinion. 

I used to love Paris. I went there for the first time more than 25 years ago, and spent more than a month pretty much walking through the city every day, morning to night. After that, I tried to visit as often as I could, and spend a few days every time.

For reasons of life, I didn't get a chance to go again for about 10 years, but, last year, I finally managed to finagle some vacation time and scheduled a full week in France (took a day-trip to Mt. Saint-Michel, but the rest was exclusively Paris).

Well, I'm sorry to say that it sucked. Paris has changed a lot - and not in a good way. It's not that it's crowded and there are too many tourists - that was always the case. Not that the airplane workers' strike stranded me for a few hours in Rome. That seems to be a regular occurrence in France - it happened to me before, and I take it in my stride. But what I felt this year is that Paris is trying too hard to be a cosmopolitan city - and losing a lot of its character. It's like it's afraid or ashamed to be French - to me, it just didn't feel like the capital of France anymore. It was just another generic big metropolis. For example, I had trouble finding good French food (in France!). What you could get everywhere was bland international stuff, spaghetti, hamburger or pizza, even sushi. Now, I don't have a problem with any of them, but I'm in fucking Paris! 

Another issue is that the peddlers are out of control. Used to be the Sacre-Coeur area was pretty bad, but now it's the same all over the city center. I walked from the Trocadero to the Eiffel Tower, and it was packed with sellers of cheap tourist tat, like brass models of the Eiffel Tower. I got interrupted so many times when I was trying to take some pictures of the Eiffel Tower from the top of the stairs (yeah, unoriginal, I know), that I just gave up and left.

Not everything is bad, of course: for example, I think the Orsay museum was much improved compared to the last time I was there - they have opened a lot of side rooms with collections, and they were better exhibited than last time I was there. However, all in all, I'm not looking forward to my next visit, as I used to do.",,/r/europe/comments/aubqwj/have_a_nice_week_from_paris/eh7ln32/,chatbotte,1551053390

3875,"Ok, let's back track this argument a bit. I started of with claiming Israel has apartheid laws.

You questioned my statement, so I googled it and gave 3 examples of apartheid-esque behaviour in Israel as well as a source listing more examples. You then questioned my 3 examples.

So right from the start this becomes an argument about my pretty much random selection of 3 things that give apartheidy vibes in Israel. There is a whole Wikipedia page left with examples of how Israel has apartheid laws. Just the fact that there is a Wikipedia page about it should be giving you the hint that stuff Israel is doing isn't 100% kosher (man I'm funny).

But whatever, let's set that aside and break down what the argument has devolved to in my three examples.

&amp;#x200B;

Example 1 - The national registry. I say a government shouldn't be keeping track of information they have no business knowing, you refute it with Israel's weird military service laws. Could you please give me a good reason for why only specific nationalities have mandatory military service? I know this might sound crazy, but in my opinion a country should treat all its citizens equally. Either mandatory service for all or for none, pretty simple right? And this comes with the added bonus of not having to keep track of completely irrelevant information about your countries citizens.

\&gt; The question is not if it is harmful or not. I'm sure it can be.

You said it yourself, the information in the registry could be used in a harmful manner. A government that chooses to keep something that may be used in a harmful manner is quite frankly promoting harmfulness. And since the harm that can be done using this registry is very much tied to prejudice based on nationalities, the government is promoting that prejudice.

If a government made murder legal, and people started killing each other, then the government is responsible for those murders. In the same way, if someone used the information in that registry to discriminate against a nationality, then the government is responsible for that discrimination.

&amp;#x200B;

Example 2a - The self-determination part of ""Jewish State bill"":

You refuted my statement about the bill giving Israel's Jewish citizens the sole right to self-determination. I quoted the part of the bill which confirmed my statement. And a couple comments later we're in some sort of argument about whether I quoted it correctly or not. So you are no longer arguing whether or not this bill is an apartheid law (which it is), we're just arguing how I forgot to mention the state of Israel when I paraphrased the bill.

You are also keep asking me for my definition of self-determination. Not really sure what that adds to the argument. I might be wrong here, but my personal definition of words are not used in Israeli lawmaking. You might be confusing me with a dictionary. I know my vocabulary is good, but it's not that good. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Example 2b - The housing part of the ""Jewish State bill"":

I am willing to give some ground here. The apartheidiness of this bill depends on how it is interpreted. But I have to say, the fact that there is a possibility to interpret it in an apartheidy way is pretty scary and should cause worry. Laws can be misused by being interpreted in a malicious way. That's why lawmakers always argue so much about the wording in law, to avoid the problem of misinterpretation. So I can very much see some racist asshole using this law to set up a Jew-only community somewhere in Israel. 

But maybe you guys don't have racists in Israel, so I'm willing to agree to a compromise here. This law isn't an apartheid law, but it sure as hell gives those kinds of vibes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Example 3 - The disparity in funding between Hebrew and Arabic schools:

I honestly can't understand what you're trying to say with ""this has nothing to do with funding"". Arabic children who want an education have 2 choices.

Either they can go to a school where they understand the language and get a worse education than their Hebrew-speaking counterparts because the Arabic schools offer a lower quality of education due to funding.

Or, go they can go to a school where they don't understand the language and get a worse education than their Hebrew-speaking counterparts because they have to learn a new language to understand what is being taught properly.

Ok then, clearly it's their fault. These idiots didn't want to cede land to a foreign power? And once the Soviets took it by force they wanted to reclaim it by allying with their enemies? Impossible. As we know the USSR was only sending humanitarian aid to the Finns, how ungrateful of them.

4014,"&gt;According to their operating manuals, NPPs show a quite remarkable flexibility with regard to the speed at which the power can be adjusted: At almost full load (above 80 % of nominal power [Pnom] for PWR and above 90 % for BWR), the power output can be increased or reduced by up to 10 % of the nominal power per minute. In the upper load range (above 50 % Pnom for PWR and above 60 % for BWR), the PWR construction series can be adjusted by 3.8 to 5.2 %/min and the BWR construction series by 3.8 to 4.6 %/min (for BWR, this value is reduced to approx. 1 %/min if individual fuel rods are defective). For comparison: For lignite-fired power plants, this value is approx. 3 %/min, for coal-fired power plants it is approx. 4 %/min and for (natural) gas-steam or 3 combined cycle power plants it is 6 %/min. Only gas-turbine power plants with a value of 12 %/min can be adjusted much more quickly. According to the operating manuals, the lower load range (between 20 and 50 % for PWR, respectively 60 % for BWR, respectively) can also be used. However, discussions with power plant operators showed that this lower load range is not being used for normal operation so far (except for start-up and shut-down operations).

Likud is supposed to be their centre-right party. Shows how much Israel’s politics has moved to right and are slowly getting more corrupt and nationalist. 

Personally, I think this is due to the number of Orthodox Jewish people in Israel has increased by over 50% in 20 years due to population growth. The Arab population is now at 24% when it used to be 5% 20 years ago. The Orthodox community have on average 4-5 kids per couple whereas the average Israeli citizen has 1.8.

And how can i send you any proof? Surely Greece didn't keep the evidence. They don't even want to talk about what happened with Chams (Greek politicians). 

Yes Orthodox Albanians *considered* themselves Greek while Catholic Albanians considered themselves Latin and Muslims considered themselves as Ottomans. This was the propaganda pushed by Greek Church and the Ottoman Empire. Kinda sad that you use that as an example. Arvanites fought for Greek independence because it was their country too.
And how come Soulites identified as Greek but at the same time helped Ali Pashe Tepelena to butcher Greeks and were the only ones to help him when the Turks were coming for his head? Doesn't make any sense. Yes that region had Greeks who came to enjoy the privileges that region had but Soulites and other Arvanites were Arbereshe-what we called ourselves before changing it to Shqipetare.

Council of Europe has Greek influence on it. And if Greeks say Albania is mistreating minorities they'd go along with it.

4083,"&gt;Plus you have that warm feeling in your belly that you did not do anything immoral

Taxes are not immoral.

&gt;What's even cheaper in the long run is not subsidising irresponsible behaviour. 

OK, so you go ahead and tell people not to have sex. Sounds like a winning plan. Especially try to do that with the 15-25 year old crowd please and see how it goes. How about instead you look at the actual facts and see that in locations where there is good sex education and contraceptives available, there are less teen mothers, maybe you'd start to see telling horny young people to not have sex instead of taking measures to protect them against the possible results in the first place is a terrible plan.

&gt;I still don't see how me and my buddies voting to take your money would be robbery,

Because with taxes you pay into the system and the decide how it is going to be spent. You already pay. In your example you are going to people and force them to pay. Like I said, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of taxes and government spending, leading you to believe taxes are robbery.

&gt;Just because the taxman goes to the bank where you keep your money and not to your housee does not change the basic truth of the situation.

Way to ignore anything I have said and just repeat yourself again. Your basic truth is not truth, it is a wrongful representation of the situation.

&gt;But that is not the situation, so I am not going to answer that. It is unrelated to the discussion.

Funny, since you keep asking unrelated questions yourself.

I think this discussion is pretty much done. You have proven time and again you just don't understand the modern tax system and nothing I am going to say is getting through to you.

I'm tired of this christian racism. Norsemen were the equals of any other European society at the time. Our weapons were top quality for Europe, our clothing was as fine as anywhere else, we were cleanlier than other Europeans, and valued poetry more than pretty much anything other than combat prowess.

To say they weren't warriors is just plain lies.

What is a warrior? Someone who trains in the arts of war. Well every norse child did that since they were around 7. They practiced fencing, archery, they had board games to teach strategy, and a grapple style martial art called Glíma, designed for use in real battle, none of this bullshit taekwando or kung fu.

Every Norseman was both a warrior and whatever else he was. And there were professional armies too, as well as elite warrior bands like the Jomsvikings.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/au6bln/viking_expansion_from_8th_to_11th_centuries/eh6qvdj/,kinapuffar,1551031242

James III, Charles and Henry were the last of the The Stuarts Catholic male line but the female protestant line of The Stuarts survives to this day on the current throne - as Elizabeth II is the **direct** descendant of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia (daughter of James I) through 2 different lines

Only a small number of Cham Albanians went to Turkey because of Italy's objection (the motive behind that objection became apparent soon enough) anyway.

How did Greeks commit a genocide? The Chams were expulsed, not killed. And again, it wasn't the Greek state that expulsed because at that time the government was in exile because of the occupation forces that the Chams joined.

When you use the word some it makes it sound like only a handful took place when in reality the Chams that collaborated with the Axis forces actively participated in the destruction of numerous villages and the killings of over a thousand Greeks.

If I were you looking I'd tone it down a bit. The Greek community of southern Albania (or northern Epirus for the Greeks) used to the majority in that region (to the point where an autonomous Greek republic was created) but because of Albania's oppressing policies which continue to this day, the Greek population has decreased significantly. I'd be more careful with accusing the other side of genocide, when your country is still is oppressing the Greeks of Albania.

Honestly, I'd support the idea of Greece compensating the Chams that didn't collaborate with the Axis, if Albania would stop oppressing the Greek community and would allow it to exist without fear.",,/r/europe/comments/atj0sn/there_are_5_eu_countries_that_havent_recognised/eh6rxca/,spiros_epta,1551032008

4236,"We agree on the most part and I don’t always believe in science. I prefer to take the approach most peer review boards etc take, there have two be at least two studies done separately and ideally with different methods to be considered proof, at least for now. The more such studies the more proof we have. I mean basically we know what causes say the flu or the plague (something they did not know during the epidemics), we somewhat know what leads to say stokes and heart attacks, but not fully, as they happen in people with no risk factors (so there must be others unidentified as of yet, but the identified ones are proven). As for what causes say cancer, ms, autism, schizophrenia etc etc we know basically nothing, can only name likely culprits in some cases, use broad terms such as genetic and enviromental issues, but know very little. And while our inner assumptions sometimes prove right they sometimes also prove very wrong. But sometimes, like with the black plague, the wrong assumptions turn to be useful, as with the doctor masks, they believed the smell caused the spread. It did not. But masks stopped the bacteria, despite not being intended for it and no knowledge of said bacteria.

However we disagree totally on what constitutes proof with the earth part. Once the maps where filled and especially once we started using airplanes, imho we have 100 percent proof. No flat earth model would allow a Europe to Europe via Asia, Tahiti, US and back again flight, as this would have had to cross the earths edge if it had one.

They also let say American drinks like Coke and Pepsi in, in I think the early 70s. And allowed a radio, which basically played Western hits. Just giving the people a little glimpse, to maybe stop them protesting.

The most interesting glimpse of the West allowed IMHO was actually in Moscow, before the fall of the USSR, letting McDonald’s in, which gave us the weirdest official logo ever, the golden arches with the sickle and hammer Soviet flag :D

The majority of the slavic speakers on what would became the Greek side despite speaking a slavic language self-identified as Greeks as they have done before the Ottoman empire at the time of Byzantium when they stopped the attacks of the Slavs against their territory. The Slavs called these people Grecomans to be assimilated by the other Slavs when they would conquer this territory with the help of mother Russia. 

Greece had every right to protect it's population from being forcibly assimilated. Considering that the number you too use 100.000- 500.000 with a small margin of error of 400.000 was the excuse that was used in the attempt to partition Greece for the lost lebenstraum. You can see why Metaxas decided to ban the use of the language for the fear of neighboring countries converting his people.

Here you can see the timeline for the events: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-15390884

If they could not foresee that there was a change that the UK could leave the EU in 2011 then I think that's pretty shocking. We are after all only talking about them needing to take a look at the polls and the political debates at the time, and concluded that there is a change that some politician could be swayed/elected to hold an referendum on it to meet popular demand the time. 

It would be like them not been able to realise that far right VOX will likely get a huge boost in the coming Spanish election or that Lega could become the biggest party in Italian politics in the future.

4420,"Jumping from taxation to goulags, so edgy...

When you don't pay your taxes, you get a warning and a fine. Don't pay that and a collection process will start. If you are under a certain income and don't actually have money, you will get into a program to pay it off through taking it directly from your salery over a period of time. There might also be help offered to figure out the best approach to handle your debts. 

If you keep all your money in cash, you probably run your own business, because in 2019 salaries are paid out to your bank account by every employer. Not paying taxes then means you will go out of business and your assets from that business will be sold to pay your debt.

It stopped its best after the Normands left it in 1140.
Go visit the Zisa, Palazzo dei Normanni and so on, it is worthwhile. 
Normands discovered Sicily on their way to Holy Land for the Crusades and realized it was beautiful and belonged to Islam. 
So they told the Pope: we will bring it back to christianity BUT you it will be for ours to reign and live. 
The Pope agreed and so they did.
At the time Sicily had been almost 250 years under islam domination. 
There were no Churches at all.
Today you won’t find a single Mosque left.
The Normands were only 500 well organized and strong chivalry soldiers.
They imported people from north of italian peninsula to work the land.

Where the hell did you hear that? First, that extra tax has not been implemented yet. There is no clear plan on how it can be done, just talks. 

Second, nobody has suggested there would be a toll at the entrance like in a theme park. That Daily Beast article that keep on repeating the word ""turnstile"" really is bullshit.

Anafilactic shock and death can be caused by essential medication like penicilin and aspirin or by foods like peanuts, fish or strawberries, or by a bee sting. Basically by everything.

4690,"&gt; Actually, this is the real reason we got deported in 1944. Everybody in the North Caucausus despised and feared us and was angry that Moscow wasn't doing anything concrete to stop Chechen and Ingush raids,

What? That's beyond stupid, and a blatant lie. Chechens haven't raided anyone, nor anyone raided anything during the '30s or '40s.

&gt; Chechen-Ingush collaboration with the Nazis finally gave the necessary excuse for Moscow to ""solve the problem"".

Nazis even haven't made to Chechnya and Ingushetia. Practically they weren't even able to collaborate. What kind of nonsense is that?

Nazis sent a small unit of paratroopers beyond their military line, yet Vainakh rebels refused to collaborate and sent an answer saying they'd treat them no different than Russian invaders. Majority of Chechens and Ingush weren't even backing the rebels, but they served in the Red Army instead.

&gt; Actually, funnily enough, I even heard of stories of my ancestors and other Chechens of the time teaming up with Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks from the north of Chechnya

So you're weird enough to claim there were Ukranian Cossacks in north of Chechnya. Ukranian Cossacks were in Ukraine, and closest thing you can get may be ones get formed into Kuban Cossacks while they don't self identify as Ukranian really. Kuban Cossacks were far away from Chechnya, and any Ukranian Cossack order was even further away.

Ingush once teamed up with Russian forces against Chechens and the once existing third Vainakh nation, but then they've realised the situation and fought against Russian Empire instead. Ossetians never fought any war that includes Chechens and Russian Empire at the same side. You're delusional.

But it pisses me off that there are still people denying the gravity of this issue. Even in the catholic church themselves.

If you wanna clean the catholic church and get rid of the pedophiles, you need to clean up catholicism *itself*. There's a structural problem within the religion itself and it's not gonna stop if you just remove the offenders.

And the catholic church still isn't acknowledging this. It sill believes things will be ok when you remove the offenders. But it won't be ok, cause they're not the only problem.

Yep. A mixture of intentional (I knew it would quote) and accident (I copied the text I wrote above before hitting reply and going with it.

&gt;As for the first of those kebab sandwiches or whatever they're called I've never heard anyone claim they were invented by a ""German"" German, I think most people are clear on that it was Turkish immigrants.

The argument tends to be that Doner Kebabs are a German invention because the most typical form found in most places in europe started in germany by a gastarbeiter. (Which is still arguable, since the german pictures tend to have brotchen type bread, the UK uses pitta breads, and clearly the best form is in Lavaş/tortillas).

But that's bullshit since kebabs are obviously an ottoman/middle eastern food. Although the greek style is still mighty fine, and I would eat it again. 

&gt;Concerning the people working in Döner shops today we could start a whole new thread debating if they're German or not (though I don't think it would be fruitful or our place to do so). Most are 2nd or 3rd generation Turkish-Germans and have German citizenship. They aren't called Hans.

&gt; Apart from a few voluntary codes, the American poultry industry is unregulated compared with that in the EU, allowing for flocks to be kept in far greater densities and leading to a much higher incidence of infection. While chicken farmers in the EU manage contamination through higher welfare standards, smaller flock densities and inoculation, chlorine washing is routinely used in the US right at the end of the process, after slaughter, to clean carcasses. This latest study indicates it simply doesn’t work.

They delay not because they don't have jobs, but for the very opposite reason: they have jobs and don't want to sacrifice their careers before they even get started. Women with less education (no secondary school) tend to have children earlier despite the fact that unemployment rates are much higher, and even when employed their income levels are much lower.

It was. Especially since the only reason Chechens rose up is because of Avar agitation.

Chechnya for Russia, before the discovery of oil, was nothing more than a convenient place to build a road into western Dagestan.

&gt;  Its a recent phenomena where some dumb Chechens blame the defeat of the Imamate and surrender of Shamil on the Avars.

5049,"**Courtesy of a friend**:

The retired Chinese General considered carefully and then divulged this sage advice: “Don’t put yourself in a pitiful position.”

It’s not quite Sun Tzu, but then, her audience wasn’t at that level. She had been asked, in light of the US pulling out of an arms control treaty with Russia, what message she had for the unhappy child in the middle, Europe. Former US diplomat Richard Burt, chairing the panel, couldn’t believe his ears. “’Pitiful’ position?” he spluttered. “Pitiful. Is that the right word?” asked General Yao Yunzhu. “It’s the right word!” said Mr Burt. “I wouldn’t use it too much in public.”

Dr Yao wasn’t embarrassed, though. It’s an age for saying things that were, until recently, deemed true but impolite. At the Munich Security Conference, a big, diplomatic shindig held in Germany last week, one of those truths was that Europe is an increasingly passive player in the great geopolitical game. As a Bloomberg write-up put it: “If China and the US are in the midst of a divorce, Europeans look increasingly like the children.”


Nowhere is that truer than in defence. Europe relies for its defence on the US, but rather than generating any gratitude, this seems to give EU leaders an endless sense of superiority. They denounce American militarism, critique the US social spending model and moan about its “unilateral” decision-making, all while free-riding on its $730 billion defence budget.

Of course, those European countries for whom defence really means something behave differently. The Baltic States, with an eye on Russia, all meet their Nato spending obligations and support Donald Trump when he demands that others do so. This is because Nato troops are deployed on Baltic soil and, according to Latvia’s foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics, they have made his country feel safer from invasion than it did five years ago.

Eastern European states therefore take the US more seriously than Brussels. When a US government changes, they flood Washington DC with officials on the off-chance of collaring some new member of the administration. And when the US complains about a Chinese-Eastern bloc infrastructure investment forum, known as “16+1”, undermining the Western alliance, a country like Poland listens, unlike when Brussels says the same thing.

Brussels might think that regulating the world’s largest single market makes it a superpower. Instead, the EU struggles to enforce even basic political standards among its members. Trade is one thing, but there is simply no substitute for feeling safe.

Germany, however, clings to pacifism, hoping that Mr Trump’s demand for Berlin to pay its way is a temporary aberration. Angela Merkel is moving defence spending “in the direction of” Nato targets and says Germany’s deployment of troops to join France in Mali was “a gigantic step”. A “gigantic step” for Germany, though, is a pigeon step for Europe.

Nor will that change while much of the continent persists in thinking that defence is irrelevant or something that external benefactors are obligated to supply. In the Brexit negotiations, EU states have threatened us, called Gibraltar a “colony”, eyed our fishing grounds and our financial industry, yet somehow expect UK voters to support the unconditional deployment of our troops on Europe’s borders.

 The Rock is seen near the border with Spain in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar

Britain is one of Europe’s bigger military contributors, but even here, defence has been endlessly deprioritised. Retiring officers repeatedly warn that we are operating below minimum safe levels, our frigates can’t put to sea for lack of sailors and spending has halved relative to GDP in 25 years. Yet in the great austerity debate, despite an increasingly unstable world order, defence doesn’t even get a look-in.

But it is Europe’s most dominant economy that really personifies its fecklessness. Racked by war guilt, a wide spectrum of German society does not believe in military spending. Business types think it wasteful. Others, like thousands of protesters outside the Munich conference last week, campaign against nuclear weapons. These marchers should be grateful that the US nuclear shield even deigns to cover them. Instead they protest like spoilt children.

This is the state of public opinion during a time of plenty, with Germany’s budget surplus at a record high. Now, a recession is on its way. On defence, as one official put it: “We have wasted the last five years.”

What’s more, Germany’s pacifist Green Party is enjoying a surge in support. If and when they enter government, they will find their pro-EU instincts conflict sharply with their anti-war tradition. Any renewal of a pact between France and Germany, essential to keeping the EU together, won’t just be about the euro, but must involve military cooperation. France is tired of shouldering so much more of the burden than its bigger neighbour.

Europe is far from stepping up to its responsibilities. Despite hyperbolic talk of an “EU army”, all Brussels has done so far is establish joint training and procurement programmes to make the continent’s patchwork of underfunded militaries marginally more functional. In Eastern Europe, they know better than to rely on such a prospect. As Mr Rinkevics put it, given the fuss over basic Nato spending targets: “Who on earth is going to pay for a European army?”


Underlying Europe’s helplessness is a stubborn belief that militaries just aren’t relevant any more. Desperately behind the times, too many of Europe’s voters and politicians seem to believe we are living in a post-Cold War “end of history”, in which all the world democratises peacefully. In fact, we long ago entered an era of competitive military spending between the US, Asia and Russia, conflict and environmental degradation fuelling mass migration, terrorism, hybrid warfare and existential challenges to global forums like the the EU. Europeans have failed to realise that historically low levels of military spending are now a dangerous luxury.

In the old days, historians had a name for this sort of lethargic complacency. They called it decadence. Declining empires used to spend their cash on monuments and extravagant public festivals. Now, we splurge on much worthier, but also more expensive projects, like welfare, while ignoring the world around us.

In Munich, Merkel made a grand pitch to defend international governance structures. Europe still has pretensions towards shaping the future geopolitical map. Yet it’s also happy to be a free-riding supplicant to the US for that most fundamental of all state functions: security.

The day after Merkel’s speech, the sound of the city was that of old church bells punctuated by the roar of supercar engines. Europe is a lovely place to hold a summit. The question is whether, in 10 or 20 years, its nations can live up to their aspiration to be guardians of the global order, rather than just its hapless dependents.

You ask the chef to make one without dairy. The chef says there’s no way to make this particular dish without dairy. You spend ages arguing about it, with the chef continuing to insist that the dairy is integral to the dish and even if there were something she could substitute, it would have to be made from scratch which would take an hour or more, and a customer won’t forgive a wait that long for a dish that’s going to be terrible because it’s missing a key ingredient.

Sounds like the core system was developed around 2007-2010s and after that it was mainly maintenance and smaller upgrades here and there.

Then why are you saying everybody liked communism equally? Commies literally starved people to death and engineered famines from Ukraine to Kazakhstan. Then tried to capture all lost Russian Empire's territories except Finland where they had their snouts beat.

&gt;Why do you beat your wife?
Why are you constantly lying?

&gt;Funny that you would ask that, considering that you have nothing to do with our people. You continuously post nonsense. When you post in Russian, you clearly use google-translate, and when you post in Chechen, you repeat the same 4 or 5 questions you copy-pasted(together with grammatical mistakes and typos) from a poor quality Chechen phrase website.

I speak fluent Chechen (I write it bad tho because I didnt learn it in school), I live in Moscow and Grozny. And the one that has nothing to do with our people is you, some French larper that defends Russia and communism in every post, do you even understand how comical is it? You even went out of the way and said that Russia didn't do any crimes in Chechnya and under any Chechen related topic you ALWAYS protect big stronk Russia, do you understand how idiotic this looks from the outside and especially from Chechen point of view? Even fucking Kadirov people that get payed millions to do it, dont spew this idiocy that you do over here.

Wgat you are is some Western/Slav (You for some reason always defend balkans and serbs as well) idiot that watched too much RT and think Chechens behave what you saw on RT, heads up, they don't and the worldview differs by 180 degrees. You even went out of the way and said majority of diaspora in Europe likes Kadirov and Russia and not those ebil wahhabis like Dudaev and Maskhadov who genocided 20000 gorillion Russians before the war. This is lunacy. You are like a huge flashlight in the dark, you stand out too much, while you try to hide.

I talk to many Chechens on reddit as well I have some relatives in Belgium/Austria and not a single Chechen would write shit what you do.  You literally look like some idiot foreigner that assumed ""Chechen"" identity was based on some RT news and le based Kadirov defender of Russia from ebil wahhabis. You are fake to the core, if any Chechen saw you in person you would end up with a bottle in your ass and on apologizing video.

**You just keep on saying you are a Chechen to give your words some more weight while feeding people Russian bullshit**. You talk how bad is Europe while LIVING IN IT (supposedly), take a step back and look at how retarded you look.

Why should society stump up disproportionately large amounts of taxpayer cash to educate some citizens over others? This is deeply unfair and deprives areas with reasonable people of their rightful educational funding. It's justifiable if the kids have learning disabilities, but not if their kids just don't give a fuck.

Case in point: in the UK we have many poor immigrants who are outperforming native white britons from working class backgrounds. Overall financially the immigrant and native families are probably equal at the outset, however over time the immigrants being less 'shitty' overall in terms of their family values and placing more value on the importance of education ultimately end up outperforming the native white brits when it comes to quantifiable factors of educational attainment such as the university admissions rate.

5248,"&gt;Which is why it is not stealing your property, because this is how our democratic system works.

Except it is. The concept of the state is the forced redistribution of wealth. Some people feel very good agreeing to taking as much of others' wealth as possible, while others feel that using violence (or in other words, force) against others is unethical, and want oto use it as little as possible.

The system of voting has nothing to do with the above. Whether you vote for it or not, force applied on people against their will should be kept to the absolute possible minimum and instead, transactions based on the consent of both parties should be used as much as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Without threats of violence or stealing.

Except that this is not true. If you have an opinion that differs from that of ""the state"", the state feels justified to use force against you and coerce you into doing what they want, even if it is against your will.

This is pretty hilarious to me, because my great-grandparents were raiding Avar settlements up until 1944 and I grew listening to my grandpa gloating about all the Avars his dad killed in the 1930s(and gloating about the Kazakhs he killed in the 40s and 50s during raids on Kazakh settlements during the deportation).

Actually, this is the real reason we got deported in 1944. Everybody in the North Caucausus despised and feared us and was angry that Moscow wasn't doing anything concrete to stop Chechen and Ingush raids. Chechen-Ingush collaboration with the Nazis finally gave the necessary excuse for Moscow to ""solve the problem"".

Actually, funnily enough, I even heard of stories of my ancestors and other Chechens of the time teaming up with Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks from the north of Chechnya in the 1930s for bigger raids on Avars and Ossetins.",France,/r/europe/comments/atowwr/on_this_day_23rd_of_february_75_years_ago_ussr_by/eh4gmid/,Raduev,1550952451

5266,"&gt; US didn't occupy a part of Syria and declared theirs as Russia did with Crimea.

The US actively bombed Serbia in support of Kosovo's independence. Russia acted in support of Crimea's independence in a much less violent way. Note that independence means independence *from* Ukraine; what Crimea does with its independence afterwards is their choics. And it's no secret that they always wanted to rejoin Russia.

&gt; Even if true it's a bit irrelevant, for two reasons, at decisive battles: Ilovaisk and Debaltseve it was a clear Russian intervention with Russian troops, do you claim that without Russian troops Donbass locals would have beaten Ukrainian army?

I do not know the answer to that. I have no reliable information about the actual turn of events there; I have no relevant knowledge to speculate; and I am extremely sceptical about taking information provided by any of the sides at face value.

&gt; Ultimately, I cannot convince you because you are just biased as you claim I am, but I have a hypothetical question, let's say there are rebels in some part of Russia, and they are given tanks, rockets, artillery, AT, AA by Americans and 10% of the forces are Americans, wouldn't Russia claim it was invaded by Americans? 

I cannot guess what they would say today, but I know that when Saudi Arabia provided massive support to the Chechen separatists in the 90s, including lots of equipment (which had been bought from the US), training and even personnel (though likely to a smaller extent), it still wasn't known as a ""Saudi-Russian War"".

&gt; BTW, I fail to see how a country like Russia with half of GDP of California wants to play at being an international power, sure they have guns and apparently cheap lives to waste, but in the long term even compared to Europe when their economy is as big as Spain's a much smaller country 

GDP is not everything. Natural resources, military power and other factors all play a role.

&gt; heck, they cannot even finish what they started in Donbass.

I'm guessing they are doing exactly what they want, probably. If only I knew what it was that they wanted in the long term.

&gt; They would be much better if they tried to collaborate instead of bulling countries around them

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_War_(376–382)

&gt;In the summer of 376, a massive number of Goths arrived on the Danube River, the border of the Roman Empire, requesting asylum from the Huns.[6] There were two groups: the Thervings led by Fritigern and Alavivus and the Greuthungi led by Alatheus and Saphrax.[7] Eunapius states their number as 200,000 including civilians

&gt;The Thervings were probably allowed to cross at or near the fortress of Durostorum.[15] They were ferried by the Romans in boats, rafts and in hollowed tree-trunks; ""diligent care was taken that no future destroyer of the Roman state should be left behind, even if he were smitten by a fatal disease,"" according to Ammianus Marcellinus.

And then after a while 

&gt;*For without distinction of age or sex all places were ablaze with slaughter and great fires, sucklings were torn from the very breasts of their mothers and slain, matrons and widows whose husbands had been killed before their eyes were carried off, boys of tender or adult age were dragged away over the dead bodies of their parents. Finally many aged men, crying that they had lived long enough after losing their possessions and their beautiful women, were led into exile with their arms pinioned behind their backs and weeping over the glowing ashes of their ancestral homes.[33]*

[This badass guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCdiger_Nehberg) can show you how it's done. 

Quote from the article: 

&gt;In September 2000, he founded the human rights organization TARGET to prevent the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). For his commitment to endangered peoples, Nehberg was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz (""Federal Cross for Merit""). In November 2006, TARGET organized and financed a conference under the patronage of the Eygyptian Great Mufti Ali Gomaa at Al-Azhar University of Cairo. As a result of the conference, leading authorities of Islamic law denounced genital mutilation. 

Of course that doesn't mean FGM just stopped existing that day. And you're right to point out those cases in Europe, it's unacceptable this is happening even here, and not enough is done about it because the authorities are afraid to properly enforce the law when it comes to people from foreign cultures sometimes.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/attek8/the_swiss_federal_court_has_confirmed_the/eh3x42v/,giraffenmensch,1550937799

5435,"So basically NYOOC seems to have the same problem as the italian submissions are massively over represented. Also note the high influence that the italian community in NY holds, which doesn't make NY a 'neutral' place. All the olive oils imported in US have been traditionally Italian (well, spanish and greek, incorrectly labelled as Italian). 

The ranking I posted, WBOO, was founded by a german. It covers the strictest competitions in the world, based on the IOOC (International Olive Oil Council). It's a nonprofit organization with no comercial interests.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olive_Council

To participate in these 7 competitions, a number of strict rules have to be followed, which explains why the amount of olive oil entries is lower. It's definitely not easy to meet all the quality criteria established by the IOOC. You can find those rules on the WBOO website. They only rank the first, second and third prize plus five finalist from each competition.

NYOOC rules are not public and that competition is not subscribed to any international organization. It's basically organized by a website, and it's not clear which are the criteria they follow to select the entries. Looks like you just have to pay a fee and that's it... It's highly likely that most of those 1000 entries wouldn't meet the stricter criteria from the competitions which WBOO bases its ranking.

NYOOC is the best marketed competition for sure, the first showing up in Google, but that doesn't make it necessarily the best, just the one that invests the most in marketing. Good for them, I don't think there's anything wrong with that anyway.  t's a very young competition, created in 2013.

Finally, as you mention, the success rate in NYOOC is higher for the Spanish olive oils, despite the strong italian influence.

&gt;  
&gt;What’s more, the tech publication The Register reported last year that **Google was also behind the Obama Administration’s firing of Registrar of Copyrights Maria Pallante** last October — the first time the Registrar had been dismissed in 119 years — **who apparently was resisting Google’s efforts to weaken copyright protections for musicians, authors, and artists.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Google **paid University of Illinois law professor Paul Heald $18,830 to write a 2012 research paper supporting Google’s views on copyright.** Mr. Heald, however, failed to disclose that Google funded the effort.

&gt;Here’s what they do.  **One-click calling.  One-click email. One-click faxing.** Fairly predictable.

So someone can literally spam people with these tools without any effort or checks, trying to make it seem there is huge support around these campaigns. It undermines any credibility these things have.

5542,"Yes it did and I am not one of those far right people who want compensation in 2019. However the situation has changed, as all of Poland agreed, among this Polish Jews. And now some Israelis/Jews want compensation from Poland, not for what Poland (Communist Poland) took, as in plots of land with rubble, but they want compensation worth of the buildings or the current buildings themselves. These were rebuilt from said rubble with Polish taxpayer money, so Poland only owes them for the plots of land which it took. The houses were reduced to rubble by the Nazis, so the part of the compensation should be paid by Germany, as they destroyed the houses. That is why if Jews now want it they should help Poland get compensation from Germany and that want part of it, or want compensation from Poland only for the plots of land and turn to Germany for compensation for destroyed structures. Yet they attack only Poland, a fellow victim, not Germany the perpatrator and the one who actually reduced their houses to rubble.

Is it really so hard to understand? The German compensations would never be a topic, even for this controversial Polish government if not for some Jewish politicians who want compensation from Poland for mainly German faults. And the compensations often won in courts are absurd. A family had a small house in what was outskirts of Warsaw. Nazis destroyed house. The plot which laid bare as the family never came back, was taken over by Poland in the communist era when it was worth nothing. The state built a big multi family house there, for Polish taxpayer money, the downtown Warsaw borders have changed. And now the families want and often get the plot worth millions AND the house worth even more millions. With the house not being any kind of lawful compensation, as if anyone should pay for destroyed houses it would be Germany. Basically as you can see the ideas of some Jews would basically destroy Poland, as they would get whole districts of cities of million dollar housing, that they should never get. Or the money equivalent as they want it all, for the plot and house and based on CURRENT 2019 prices. So Poland can either object (hard to do when say the US and half the EU is on the side of that group of Jews), fall totally economically for not it’s crimes. Or try to get the money back from those who actually did the destruction.

Churchill agreed to write President Roosevelt for help, and replace the 45,000 tons lost in the explosion. But he “could only provide further relief for the Indian situation at the cost of incurring grave difficulties in other directions.”19

As good as his word, and despite preoccupation with the upcoming invasion of France, Churchill wrote FDR. No one, reading his words, can be in doubt about his sympathies:

I am seriously concerned about the food situation in India….Last year we had a grievous famine in Bengal through which at least 700,000 people died. This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms….By cutting down military shipments and other means, I have been able to arrange for 350,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to India from Australia during the first nine months of 1944. This is the shortest haul. I cannot see how to do more.

I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia….We have the wheat (in Australia) but we lack the ships. I have resisted for some time the Viceroy’s request that I should ask you for your help, but… I am no longer justified in not asking for your help.20

Roosevelt replied that while Churchill had his “utmost sympathy,” his Joint Chiefs had said they were “unable on military grounds to consent to the diversion of shipping….Needless to say, I regret exceedingly the necessity of giving you this unfavorable reply.”

5632,"&gt; Pretty nice. Though that's one creepy fountain tbh.

The plans for the pedestrian zones were all developed during the 70s, by architect Branislav Jovin. Work started in the 80s, when a major street, Knez Mihailova, was converted to a pedestrian area. Among other things, the Delijska fountain and the fountains near Ruski Car were built, quickly becoming beloved by the citizens of Belgrade:

The war that broke out in 1991 halted all work.

Since people won't stay away if we remove the letters (their original purpose), might as well get rid of them.
   
&gt; the letters were originally meant as a symbol of inclusion, not exclusion.    

No, the letters were to draw more visitors and to spread the word about Amsterdam worldwide. City marketing it's called. This resulted (not just bc of the sign) in mass tourism with a doubling of tourists in 15 years, touristy shops appearing everywhere, streets having to be closed due to the crowds, entire houses being put up for rent on airbnb instead of the rental market, there being no low season anymore, Amsterdammers not feeling welcome anymore in their city center. The sign really serves no purpose anymore than a big fat fuck you to all the Amsterdammers that are affected daily by mass tourism. *That's* why it's not considered solidary or inclusive. Also, it steals away attention from the beautiful Rijksmuseum.

&amp;#x200B;

There are millions of refugees in Europe and a few thousand deportations take place every year (which is a very small percentage of the total refugee population, so you can't blame any government for mass deportations).  
There are also many NGOs that openly state that these deportations constitute a violation of human rights and some times protests, like in this case, take place.

All European countries are signatories of both Geneva's Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. This means if they violate them they can be held accountable by the competent court of law which is the [International Court of Justice](https://www.icj-cij.org/en).  
A very simple question: **Why all these NGOs haven't taken one of the thousand deportation cases to the ICJ? That wouldn't just save one person, but it would create a res judicata that would prevent any future illegal deportations.** They don't take the cases to the ICJ, because they know there is no violation, so they choose to try to impose there will by force, like for example with public stunts, e.g. a viral video that intends to cause outrage against the government and would make the government to step back in order not to lose popularity among its voters.",,/r/europe/comments/as8qng/student_fined_for_halting_deportation/eh3ethj/,JustAPasserByGuy,1550916394

5759,"&gt;as a european, i can tell you that myth is unfounded. right wingers made  sure you need to pass trough their party members first before you can  legally migrate. this of course, has not stopped people from doing  illigal migration, and due to their illigal status, they cannot legally  work, and thus turn to crime.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not talking about legal immigration, i'm talking about the migrant crisis. The reason illegal migration exploded only in the last few year is because Europe was letting people in and not deporting many people.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;uhm? without those rich folks to ""payed"" the bill, you could build those  boats. without the poor folks who did the actual ship building and  supply production (actually funding it trough labour and creating and  maintaining it for a pittance in return, hence why they are poor in the  first place) those ships would not exist. the poor are more important  for a big navy, as the sailors tend to be those same poor folk.

&amp;#x200B;

How the hell are poor Africans with no money going to build a boat to cross the Atlantic? Are they going to mine and refine the iron ore themselves? Are they going to build a raft to sail 3,000 miles across the Atlantic? It takes money to do that same way it costs migrants some money to cross the med today.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It has literally nothing to do with the war on terrorism. Nobody has bombed most of the countries where these people are coming from. The big war torn countries here like Yemen, Syria, or Libya have had the shit bombed out of it by people fighting in civil wars there. Nobody is fleeing western airstrikes.

5785,"&gt;Nobody knows what will really happen, but the EU and Ireland have been very clear that they want a legal framework and insurance. 

To be fair, the UK has been quite keen on that. It reduces everyones risk.

&gt;I take them at their word that they demand this to ensure Ireland's peace is not put at risk. What other reason do you think they would/could have for such demands?

It's a very good lever for future negotiations. It would seem to significantly disadvantage the UK during the next round of negotiations and only seems reasonable if you see the EU as trustworthy and acting in everyone's best interests. Unfortunately that trust was somewhat damaged by various EU leaders pointing out that they could use the backstop to 'force' the UK to accept terms in various areas (The most famous being the Macron comments). 

&gt; I think those that negotiated the withdrawal agreement have a lot more knowledge and expertise on this matter than any of us here on the internet. I don't suspect their intentions to be deceiving, also because all those involved from the EU side have been very consistent in their standpoint. If there were any hidden agendas to these demands we would have found out by now already.

I mean, it is absolutely true that a withdrawal agreement is in everyone's interests, leaving without one is worse than pretty much every other option. That doesn't make it any more likely that Ireland will suddenly decide a hard border on the Island of Ireland is acceptable if  no agreement can be reached..

In principle you are correct, the exceptions in the 2001 Directive are optional for Member States and not all Member States have implemented those, so it is true that they do not apply everywhere in principle. But the Directive is introducing a new concept in Article 13 (5) an exception for User Generated Content. So, once the Directive enters into force all Member States will have to apply those exceptions on user uploads on platforms. So in fact, the Directive will bring more legal clarity and security for users.

Here is the text of Article 13 (5) for reference:

2. Immigration ≠ emigration. the former is inbound and the latter is outbound settlement to another country. He just uses immigration. 
3. He ends on the Corn Laws which were introduced in 1813. However, it is more for the British peasants than the Irish peasants for which, Peel wanted them repealed. The Corn Laws were against then-predominent economic theory of lassez-faire

Please refer closer to the video material. Not the violent from parent side, is here a root of case. Second thing, is that ""social service"", instead help people, accuse them by false proofs.

It's not wild west. The law and procedures are for everyone to have a chance to avoid a false accusation.

For example, mass rape of German women by the Red Army is firmly a part of the western consciousness, while the rape and extermination of millions of Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians is something that is rarely discussed in the west. The popular narrative in the west is that German atrocities were limited to Jews (and gypsies, gays) that Stalin was 'just as bad' as Hitler, and that the deaths of 27 million Soviet citizens was due largely due to Soviet incompetence and repression.

5986,"I know it's a bit of a waste to keep replying, but I feel there's something fundamental that you are ignoring, perhaps on purpose.

There's only one *country* in the world that has ""Macedonia"" in its name, and it has been called that for a long time already, by everyone outside Greece. Most people don't know, and don't really care, about the names of internal Greek regions.

For any outsider, the name ""Macedonia"" can only refer to the country, and for this reason it is also awkward to use an adjective since there is nothing to differentiate it from. Just like Ireland in this case: since Northern Ireland is not a country, ""Ireland"" does not refer to it in normal conversation. Same for ""Luxembourg"" again, it cannot refer to the Belgian region of Luxembourg, only to the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.

You can object all you want, but it's just how language works.

Also, I always find it a bit silly to refer to ""official names"" as no country is going to choose its official name in all languages of the Earth, and even if they did so it's certainly not legally binding to people who speak those languages.    
In French for example, we always use the names we decide for foreign places, ie no ""Beijing"" for us by we still call it ""Pékin"". Apparently it's different from the US point of view, but to me *la Grèce* and *la Macédoine* have no business choosing their names in my language.",🇪🇺 🇹🇫 🇨🇦 🇧🇪,/r/europe/comments/atk36e/macedonia_skopje_in_front_of_the_city_hall_people/eh36tc4/,seszett,1550904189
