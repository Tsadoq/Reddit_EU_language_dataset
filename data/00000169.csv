Really? How come then that many Christians complain that the government confiscates church property for bogus reasons?
How come that public religious processions that were allowed in previous decades were forbidden recently?
How come that the seminary for the education of Greek Orthodox priests has been closed for decades now, because it wouldn’t submit to the Turkish state, forcing the Greek Orthodox Church to send for priests from Greece on a visa to serve the needs of the congregation?
How is it possible that a previous justice minister said, that Christians who are proselytizing are committing the crime of treason?

So yeah, it’s easy to have a positive view of the way turkey treats it’s minorities, if you don’t ever bother to ask those minorities.

61,"Bullshit. There are countless child marriages among Arabs, Kurds, Pakistanis and others. 

As pertains to turkey:

&gt; Turkey has one of the highest rates of child marriage in Europe, with an estimated 15% of girls married before the age of 18 and 1% married before the age of 15.
Available data may not be representative of the scale of the issue since many child marriages are unregistered and take place as unofficial religious ceremonies.

https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/turkey/

&gt; The current outcry was started by a statement on adolescence posted online by the Diyanet, the state body which administers religious institutions and education.
It said that, according to Islamic law, the beginning of adolescence for boys was the age of 12 and for girls the age of nine. On the same website, it said that whoever reached the age of adolescence had the right to marry.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42558328

And this is only the problem of child marriages within the Islamic world. 
A common trope among many Muslims unfortunately is to pin every problem that people might have with Islam and Muslims on Saudi Arabia and salafi-Islam. They externalize the problem and don’t see their own connection to extremism. In many parts of the world outside of Saudi Arabia you can get killed for blasphemy for example. How is that the fault of Saudi Arabia? Do you know about Asia Bibi from Pakistan? Are these millions of saudis marching the streets demanding her death or are these Pakistanis filled with hate?

Privatization was done after '97, up to that point the commies were pumping money into state enterprises*.


Before the fall of the soviet union the gommies took out a massive loan from international financial institutions and defaulted on it**, a moratorium was announced on the repayment plan around '90 I think.



*
Its important to point out that commies were at the entrance and exit of every state enterprise, so the money was basically funneled away 

**
Bulgaria was pretty much the only communist country to which the IMF was willing to lend money to, the graph in OPs post pretty much shows why. All the money that was loaned was essentially embezzled immediately and transferred into private accounts abroad, most likely Switzerland. Same money was later used to buy up the state enterprises during the privatization era, thus laundering a massive amount of cash on top of making profits from selling the enterprises and their physical assets later on. Also important to point out that the bulk of our current external debt is still due to that loan the commies took out more than three decades ago.

It doesn't answer one simple question, that is the most important, in any way. The question is ""why?"". And since the regions are arbitrary, it, in a lot of cases, tell ""rural area produces more milk than a city"". No shit Sherlock.

 Gothic Cathedrals explained, American version (if someone has a simplified European version, link below). 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically this is a later version of cathedral design. The primary goal was to have the inside cathedrals have large walls of glass while keeping the walls themselves thin. They had to find a way to support these thin walls so they originally used solid supports on the outside. The problem was the light shinning through the stained glass would only appear during very particular parts of the day or not at all. By removing the solid mass, it significantly opened up the light that'd shine through thus giving the super important stained glass the glorious light it needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Afterall, the light represents God and the stained glass represents saints and what is most important to said kingdom ie former kings and noble men.",,/r/europe/comments/bkauvl/duomo_cathedral_in_milan_italy_true_gem_amongst/emfne1e/,saltyswedishmeatball,1556912558

511,"""I got drunk driving and suspended my driving license,"" said one of the drivers.

Driven by the desire to go back to the wheel, they entered the morgue. One of the drivers, however, came out a bullet after a few minutes, because it was bad. The man went home, so he was excluded from the program. But he will still have another chance to participate in the anti-alcohol program with another gup.
The other five drivers who have resisted the stage today say they have remained labeled for the rest of their lives:
""He encouraged me not to drink alcohol anymore, not a drop in my life, because I do not want to get here anymore.""

""What you see here, the experience of the morgue remains like a lesson, as a re-alcoholism."" After this course, the person no longer needs alcoholism, he understands the consequences of the acool. ""

The visit to the morgue of men whose driving license was suspended lasted about five hours. In addition to having participated in the necropsy and the cadavers' toilet, they cleaned the autopsy rooms and garbage from the institution.
""It will be a huge psychological impact because they do not all resist. Only the smell and the sight of the body and it is already a psychological impact on the person,"" said Valeriu Savciuc, director of the Center of Forensic Medicine.

""In order to get there, disciplining these subjects needs a maximum impact, so that they can 're-socialize', become more disciplined in traffic. To become aware of what the problem is, how they have come to this situation and to do not repeat, ""said Andrei Iavorschi, head of the National Probation Inspectorate.
The program lasts for up to three months and costs four thousand lei, paid by drivers. It provides 12 sessions. Three are individual and nine are group members, including a hospital visit, where they will provide assistance to road accident victims. Currently, 24 people participate in the program.
The new model of rehabilitation of drunk driving drivers is part of the anti-alcohol law package approved last year by the Government.
According to the document, those who get drunk driving are left without driving licenses until the court decision. If the court pays the carnet, they can only recover their license after the program passes. Those who cancel their license, in addition to the program, still need to back up their car exams.

There is a very large difference from baseless claims to reputable claims to legal conviction and while it is absolutely crucial for a judicial system to apply presumption of innocence in absolute, this does certainly not apply to other factions of life. Whether the claims in this case were from a reputable source or not and what kind of reaction that warrants is debatable.

I will just add, that the president didn't exercise her right not to appoint him as a minister. She simply left the room in a sign of protest. She didn't make it be a case of any legal or judicial importance what so ever. She displayed her displeasure in an unusual way. Saying that she forfeited the presumption of innocence is about the same as saying that I (a random citizen) forfeited his presumption of innocence, as I absolutely do not believe his innocence. It just doesn't make sense when there is absolutely no legal consequences to taking such a position.

And frankly, given the extent to which she has personally gone during her presidency to highlight Estonia's rampant problem with domestic violence, not taking a stance would've justifiably enraged a large portion of Estonia's population.

608,"The UK have said that they will, under no circumstances, erect a hard border, as has the Irish government. 

The European Commission has sent mixed messages, two years ago Juncker stood up in the Dail (Irish Parliament) and told Irish MPs that there would be no hard border, regardless of the outcome of the talks. Likewise, Barnier has said on several occasions that they will do everything necessary to avoid a hard border. As the process went on, they started saying that there would need to be a hard border if UK couldn't agree to the backstop (which was done to put pressure on UK HoC to ratify the deal), when it became clear that there was zero chance of the WA passing through parliament, the Commission again started softening it's tone, Ireland has just as unwavering as Westminster in insisting that there will be no hard border, regardless of the outcome of negotiations, both sides want to make it clear that if a hard border goes up, and violence returns, that will be Brussels fault. 

&gt; What I read WTO terms require a hard border in Ireland (or anywhere else for that matter). 

This is wrong. WTO does not require a hard border, it requires tariff collection in the absence of a formal trade agreement. Whether a hard border is required to facilitate this is another matter entirely. There are also exemptions to the WTO rules when security is concerned. The threat of a resurgent IRA and return the violence seen in the troubles could provide a legal justification for a less rigorous enforcement of WTO customs rules in the case of NI.

Its truly a testament to the brainwashing ability of the European Commission and Council, when they can work together, that so many people have bought into this idea that the backstop is the **only** means of preventing a return of hard border infrastructure. And a sad indictment of the media that they have largely failed to properly scrutinize this proposition. 

&gt;So basically you either have a hard border in Ireland or at least custom checks between NI and GB. 

Or you have customs checks between Ireland and the rest of the EU, would work just as well and doesn't in any way undermine their membership of the EU (four freedoms would be preserved entirely) since you wouldn't be applying any tariffs on goods whose final destination is the Republic. 

The most reasonable thing would be an amalgamation of the two, as I said, softer sea borders in the two respective seas. If you think this is fanciful you should know that it's something that the Commission has at least considered.

* Insist that all EU trade into the Republic arrives at one or two specific ports where there will be comprehensive infrastructure to determine the origins and final destination and tariff accordingly.
* Do the same for all significant sea traffic of goods between the UK and the island of Ireland.
* Flows can be pre-registered prior to landing to expedite, and all non-phytosanitary/sanitary/agricultural products can get away with simply random inspections. Information would be comprehensively shared between the UK and RoI and they would each collect tariffs on behalf of the other where appropriate. 
* This is not dissimilar to what already happens for visas and the common travel area. The UK and Ireland already align on visa polices for some countries, despite having their own independent immigration policies, and they share information to ensure that the rules are enforced. 
* Along the border in NI, install a comprehensive camera network along major roads to monitor traffic, in particular commercial vehicles as passenger vehicles are unlikely to be relevant. This would be a beefed up and more advanced version of the model that exists along Norway-Sweden border. 

Its not a perfect system but there are multiple mitigating factors. 

* The fact that Ireland is an island that shares a land border with no other countries makes it much easier to monitor the flow of goods into and out of it since they must all come by either boat or plane. 
* The current system that already exists isn't perfect either. Goods flowing into both countries on WTO terms are, at present, only subject to random checks and smuggling/slippage does occur
* The Irish economy is small, attempts to use exploit the arrangement to smuggle large quantities of goods either into the UK or the rest of the EU via Ireland would be relatively easy to detect.
* You provide an incentive for business to comply by enforcing severe penalties for attempts to circumvent the system. People will be reluctant to smuggle in order to save a few % if the consequences of getting caught are being fined into bankruptcy. 
* Ultimately the many of the drawbacks would largely be addressed through a EU-UK free trade agreement. Not eliminated by any means, but trivialised to a large degree.

First of all it takes years for those immigrants to gain the right to vote.  


Once they have the right to vote, they would need to have a unified world view to have any meaningful impact on the political system, since even though there is a lot of them they are still very few in comparison to the total population. But they aren't unified at all. Not even all immigrants from the same country are unified, like you really think all Syrians have the same political viewpoint? If so, then why did they even have a civil war? But you have people from very different origins, MENA, Syria, Irak, Afghanistan, East Africa. They are as disparate as it gets, and thus won't ever show a unified political front.  


Germany has millions of people of Turkish descent from the 60s and 70s, where is their takeover of the political system? It's not there, they vote for the existing parties based on their socio economic status like everyone else in Germany does.

&gt;in 1904 the Hackenberg family run the coffeehouse who begged for princess Stephanie to let them name the coffeehouse after her.

In reality the coffehouse was named after the princess right at opening (1897) when Róza Dresdner run it, years before the Hackenberg family, and there is no source of begging.

The house owner was Rosa Fleischamn who later rent to Bela Hackenberg

This could mislead believing the first owner was Rosa Fleischamn, while in reality it was countess Irma Erdődy. It raises questions why it was important in a brief description to mention Rosa Fleischamn -who I could find no information of- but to not mention Irma Erdődy who built the house.

692,"I think that Brexit was a mistake. 

Even though I have little to no faith in the long term prospects of the EU (I believe that the euro will end up sinking the project), there was no real reason for the UK to leave, we could have just stuck it out with relatively little exposure compared with what we'd have outside the union. And if the EU somehow managed to resolve its internal contradictions, then everything would be fine. So I voted to remain. 

Given the result of the referendum though, and the events of the past 3 years, I think we should just get on with it. A second referendum would do nothing to heal the divisions within the country and would, imo, most likely result in a second vote for leave.

The economic consequences of leaving the EU have been exaggerated, which isn't surprising given the vested interests in not upsetting the status quo. Whilst it's not like there will be no impact, it won't be Armageddon for the UK either, even in the case of a no-deal (for which both sides have done much preparation). 

Currently, the biggest drag on the UK economy is uncertainty regarding our departure from the EU. It has been strangling investment for the past two years and needs to end. 

For this reason, I will be voting for the Brexit party. I have no love for Mr Farage and would never vote for his ilk in a general election, but I think that he can probably get around 40% votes in the EP. If this happens, his party looks like a viable threat in a GE, as first past the post cannot save Labour and the Tories from a Brexit party that polls well above 30%. This would be a monumental realignment of British politics and a very serious threat to both mainstream parties. It is precisely the thing that they need to focus their minds and work together to get a deal done on Brexit. With Brexit out of the way, support for Farage and his party would quickly fade.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/bjtzlz/bank_of_england_raises_uk_growth_forecast/emeqkv7/,MyFavouriteAxe,1556890962

The issue is the second will typically manifest itself as a lot of people working overtime, and a lot of people being unemployed. The solution is not to get everyone to work despite them not creating any value. The solution is to redistribute the work.

Furthermore, my own country got through the crisis pretty unscathed. The biggest factor in how the crisis manifested with wasn't currency, but austerity.

* Do not accept any more refugees or those who claim asylum. Let them go to other countries with same cultural and religious views. 
* Do not allow any religious education center to be opened, most of them are teaching hatred toward non muslims and that is ground enough for banning them
* Do not give government money and grants to muslim activities, at least in Sweden they give plenty to help with mosques and some such.
* Ban religious activities, signs, preaching, etc. in any public place and services, that is for any religion. Being YW or Catholics or muslim or Jewish signs or whatever.
* Put an absolute stop in muslim running their sharia law and their crazy ways in Europe. Wedding underage girls in their countries and bringing them to Europe, having the the freedom to treat women poorly since that is their fucking culture insulting girl and women in the street because they are not being covered in hijab.
* Do not allow provisions like: Separate swimming class, separate sport class, separate whatever for muslim students. WTF is that, forcing a little girl to cover her hair and suffocate in heat of summer or disallow them to swim because boys and girls cannot be mixed and see each-other

I used the -15 guy rethoric against him to underline his nonsense.

And, of course, true believers-christians are actually a growing minority, as atheism increases, but is a fact that christian culture is still part of european identity.

But we should understant that today discriminating, something already disgusting, should not be motivated by religious differences.

Of course guys think of Islam as a religion of terrorism, but that's a small minirity. We can think of crime rates, but it's caused by lack of education and subhuman living standards which cause of course a degradation of a person's behaviour.

The government gave binding force to a compilation of Statuti written by Camillo Bonelli,[2] covering the institutions and practices of Sammarinese government and justice at that time. It was written in Latin and contained in six books. The title in Latin is Statuta Decreta ac Ordinamenta Illustris Reipublicae ac Perpetuae Libertatis Terrae Sancti Marini.

&gt; The new system was an update on the Statuti Comunali (Town Statute) which had served San Marino from about 1300. Existing institutions, such as the Council of the Sixty, were carried forward from this period. The Statutes form the basis of all law in effect today, so it may be the oldest constitution of any existing nation.

Will it kill you? No it will not. Does that make it good food? Nooo. Does importing high amounts of cheap low quality food make local producers who use proper, safer, and therefore slightly more costly methods happy? Most likely not. 

Chlorinated chicken is obviously a great thing for you, because you're clearly a fan and a gourmet, but it's being brought up as a bad thing probably because it's at least somewhat preferable to strive for higher food quality standards, or standards in general since chlorinated chicken is literally anything that hasn't caught a  plague deadly for humans before its slaughter and subsequent chlorination.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/bk15qu/at_un_europeans_feel_shunned_by_us/emeadv2/,potatolulz,1556877443

968,"&gt; Pacts and Constitutions of Rights and Freedoms of the Zaporizhian Host was a **1710** constitutional document written by Hetman Pylyp Orlyk, a Cossack of Ukraine.[1]

It established a democratic standard for the separation of powers in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, well before the publication of Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws. The Constitution limited the executive authority of the hetman, and established a democratically elected Cossack parliament called the General Council. Pylyp Orlyk's Constitution was unique for its historic period, and was one of the first state constitutions in Europe.

996,"&gt;We could’ve outright vetoed treaties. And stopped any EU progression. Instead we let you guys get on with it with only a few opt outs.

&amp;nbsp;

Copypasted from an older post of mine, because it's relevant, and because I'm lazy:

&gt;The actual, painful truth is: the UK doesn't know how to negotiate to begin with, because it seldom had to, ever.

&gt;For 40 years, rather than *negotiate* with its partners, find *compromises*, and *build something together* (as everybody else did), it extensively threatened them with vetos to push its own agendas and hamper everything else. That's not negotiation ; that's **coercion**.

&gt;All the while, the country have been conveniently enjoying the collective negotiating weight and power of the EU whenever it had to deal with extra-EU actors. Your behaviour goes **way** beyond having your cake and eating it too: it's expecting the whole bakery to be your own and have Europeans pay for it.

&gt;The UK is the only member that failed to understand that this is **not** what the EU is about, and somehow entertained the idea that it was merely a tool to use for its own power struggles.

&amp;nbsp;

Really, some of you guys are completely disconnected when it comes to dealing with the rest of Europe. You're endlessly circling around the same narrative of the UK being either an exploited victim, or a forgiving and magnanimous partner. It's surreal.

1062,"&gt;I don't expect that, I just don't see how you can have climate measures without taking away everything the lower middle class has gained over the years (and ofc giving nothing back of what they lost).

? They still retain their income. Just the price of greenhouse gas emissions will rise.

&gt;They will all be about raising prices to levels more and more can't afford, which is the point, yet the wealthy won't feel it much.

That's already to the case for many goods, so I don't see why this is particularly worrisome.

&gt;Or they will be about erecting restrictions like electric vehicles they can't afford, or giving subsidies only the wealthy can profit from (see Belgian solar panel subsidies out of reach for renters and poor home owners, but paid for with thei electricity usage surcharges)

72% of Belgians owns a house, and the investment pays for itself so they can take out a loan. That being said, there should be support for poor homeowners to make those investments, but that has always been the case and would still be the case without climate change.

Article 233

&gt;The President of the Republic* shall become permanently unavailable to serve by reason of any of the following events: death; resignation; removal from office by decision of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice; permanent physical or mental disability certified by a medical board designated by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice with the approval of the National Assembly; abandonment of his position, duly declared by the National Assembly; and recall by popular vote.

Not the case with Maduro.

Article 333: 

&gt;This Constitution shall not cease to be in effect if it ceases to be observed due to acts of force or because or repeal in any manner other than as provided for herein. In such eventuality, every citizen*, whether or not vested with official authority, has a duty to assist in bringing it back into actual effect.

Has not happened. That's like if the AfD would form a milita trying to seize the parliament in Germany because they consider Merkel's refugee policy to be violating the constitution.

Article 350:

&gt;The people of Venezuela, true to their republican tradition and their struggle for independence, peace and freedom, shall disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates democratic values, principles and guarantees or encroaches upon human rights.

This calls more for an ousting of Guaidó rather than Maduro.

The articles invoked by the opposition are a joke to justify what they did, it's pretty clear even for a layman that you need pretty narrow and harsh conditions before you can act upon these (comparing jurisdiction of constitutional courts in Europe concerning articles of the constitutions here which have similar articles), in now way can it be justified for an *armed coup backed by a hostile power*.",,/r/europe/comments/bk0qt3/venezuelan_opposition_leader_leopoldo_lopez_seeks/emducdq/,XasthurWithin,1556859369

1243,"&gt;Unlike Maduro, Guaido is supported by the democratically elected National Asembly.

lmao 

""Unlike Trump, Nancy Pelosi is backed by the democratically elected Congress of the United States. So she's president now.""

Venezuela is not only a presidential republic with a directly elected president, the national assembly was replaced by a constitutional assembly, which has the power to overrule the national assembly.

&gt;Recognising someone who is not supported by the democratic process as the legitimate government would be stir resentment in the population of the country in question.

You are not the one deciding which ones are democratic processes and which one aren't. What kind of ""resentment"" are you talking about? The fact that Guaidó can't even drive his limousine into a Barrio [without being kicked out?](https://youtu.be/CbZLv_ntXjs)

&gt;Maduro and Chavez managed to drove the country into a situation similar to the beginning of Holodomor while filling their foreign accounts. 

 L M A O 

First off, where do you get your Holodomor information? I am not aware of any Soviet officials filling foreign ""accounts"". They had to export grain because they were sanctioned by the UK which didn't accept the gold-backed rouble and only grain in exchange with tools they needed for mechanization.

Secondly, Venezuela does not try to collectivize agriculture. In fact, the Sandanistas in Nicaragua have collectivized the agriculture more than the Chavistas ever did in Venezuela. If you really care about the Venezuelan people, as you pretend to do here, argue for relieving the sanctions to let Venezuela buy food on the world market like every civilised country, and don't support an opposition that buries living chicks, attacks food convoys, burns food aid, and attacks food research centres.",,/r/europe/comments/bk0qt3/venezuelan_opposition_leader_leopoldo_lopez_seeks/emdw1v6/,XasthurWithin,1556860859

1280,"&gt; You claimed that Stalin and Beria's settlements made Georgians majority in Abkhazia.

It did, and you came up with the largest group argument, and I said why was that.

&gt; FYI, the said settlements began in the late 1930's, so Stalin could not have made Georgians a majority if they already were a majority.

Although they weren't, but were a bit larger than the Abkhaz, meaning them being 33% and Abkhaz being 27.5%. Things came to 40% to 15%, in other words the trend of Georgians being three times of the Abkhaz population was due to Stalin and Beria.

&gt; This is wrong. Abkhazia became an autonomous republic within Georgia as per the request of Abkhazian People's Counsil after the Bolshevik revolt attempt. Abkhazia was part of Georgia both *de jure* and *de facto* internationally and locally since 1918.

De jure by Georgia and ones recognising Menshevik Georgia, maybe, de facto, it's complicated.

&gt; Not sure if you take sides because of your support of Mountainous People's Republic or your future ideals about it,

I don't have any future ideals for it. Sure, I'd be happy if North Caucasus become independent and can form some union like Nordic Council or the EU, but I'd be happy to see Georgia into that said thing as well. North Caucasians sided by Abkhaz for the reason them wanting independence, and that's it. Any nation deserves it, especially if they suffered oppression like they suffered under the Georgian SSR. I know it wasn't ""Georgia"" but they suffered anyway. 

&gt; but ethnic cleansing is not a way to make anyone righteous of anything.

That I agree with you. But things escalated mostly due to the Georgian leadership by then.

&gt; As for the main question of this discussion, every other conflict that Russia has frozen in its neighbourhood has/had it's different local context and history, and just because Russia used different ethnic group in this case, does not make it not fit in the post that triggered this thread.

You could argue that it's not much worse than what Europe do, and you may have a point, but looking at the situation in China, how they're acting in south China sea, in Sri-Lanka, Djibouti, Montenegro... I have much less confidence in China than in Europe as to the treatement of their economic ""partner"".

I may be proven wrong with time (and I kinda hope I will be in the wrong, since for instance, nobody really know how much China invested in Africa), but it looks quite bleak, and I personally fear that China may become a big factor of instability for Africa. For instance, in the case of a chinese bank crunch, it could have far reaching consequences on the economy of african countries deeply tied to China (Zimbabwe, Djibouti, Rwanda...), leading to instability. And if there is instability in Africa, that means more immigration towards other part of the world, and first and foremost towards Europe.",France,/r/europe/comments/bju6ec/current_account_balance_relative_to_gdp_in_europe/emd5ycw/,Dreynard,1556842043

1395,"&gt; If you want to cut the supply, rather than letting thousands die, what about limiting the reason why they leave? Khadafi was hated, but he did keep the migrant at bay. If Tunisia fall in disarray, you can bet that migrants will go through that. So we have to be a stabilising factor in this region.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We could also fund program to counteract the crazy american preacher influence in Africa that actively fight against contraception. Train teachers from those countries in Europe, and send them back afterwards to educate the population, like France do with Tunisia or Ivory coast. Give them a reason to stay by stopping the pillage of there country (like what happens in Rwanda and at the opposite of what is done in the Sahel or DRC). Fight chinese influence. We could also avoid stuff like Lybia or Rwanda 30 years ago. Have processing centre (that one is tough though). Sure, it won't stop the migrant flow in a year or two, but in 10, 20 years we may collect great dividend on that. It's not like those problems were unknown 20 or even 40 years ago, but as go the saying, ""the best day to plant a tree is yesterday, the next best one is today"".

Those are good idea, but the time frame needed for the plan it too long - 20, 30 years. I doubt it even then, because climate change is doing damage and will probably make Africa worse and worse off no matter what we do. You can't  just make your plans and assume climate change doesn't exist, because it does. And Africa will take a real hard beating from it.

So anyway, if we implemented a ""fix Africa"" policy and let migrants come in for 25 years. This would lead to disaster, because fascist govt. would win elections within this timeframe in many EU countries - 2 many migrants make people vote fascist.

Sure, but now, 2019, it's migration that are fuelling them in W European countries. I find it strange to doubt that? 

Look at Sweden for instance, with SD.

Russia, Poland, Hungary is in a different dynamic than the West, due to their different history. They really haven't been demomcracies for long. It's normal democracy doesn't just stabilize boom on the first attempts, it was the same in France.

The reason the fascists talking about migrants is that they know people might vote for them if they can convice people they can fix the migrant problem.

That is incorrect. You need to pick a method that gets the job done within the time frame possible. Example: If your boat is broken and will sink within an hour, killing you, any solution to this problem that takes more than an hour is no good, because no matter how good the solution is, you'd still die withing the hour.

Maybe the reason we can't figure out a solution to this is that it's too late and we are screwed - what will happen might be the migrants keep coming, then EU countries go fascist and mayhem ensues, in the middle of the other mayhem caused by climate changed.

1525,"The euro clearly hasn’t been disaster at all, just because certain countries aren’t doing that well economical and that are largely impacted by internal problems within those countries. The UK would have done reasonably well out of the Euro, with there being advantages of doing so. If anything it was the eurosceptic side that has been wrong about the euro and people are still underestimating it. The euro certainly isn’t going a way anytime soon and counties are still joining it. With Lithuania in 2015 being the last and Bulgaria planning to join soon. 

Joining the Euro would make the UK feel more connected to the EU and foster a stronger sense of belonging as it has done in the countries that have adopted it. It would also make the UK more committed to the EU and get rid of the disparities that get exist in it. Putting the UK in the core of members, especially as it is coming more of an important area of EU policy. 

By that logic Schengen makes less sense for Malta and Iceland but they still members of it and it isn’t really a good argument. Schengen would remove additional passport checks at ferries and airports. For the UK there are train services that go from the UK to schengen countries and could be treated as domestic services just like travailing within the country. It would also streamline the tourist visa process attracting more tourist. Especially from Asia many who often travel on organised tours and go to multiple countries. 

I also don’t think the rebate is too much of an issue and there is a justification for it with the way the UK economy is structured.

Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister, has held talks with Hungarian premier Viktor Orban to seek support for the alliance of far-right parties which he leads, ahead of the European Parliament elections later this month.

During a trip to Hungary on Thursday, Mr Salvini joined Mr Orban in viewing a 500-kilometre fence that was built on the country’s southern border in 2015, when 1m asylum seekers passed through Hungary on their way from the Middle East to western Europe.

The visit was an opportunity for Mr Salvini to woo Mr Orban, whose Fidesz party was suspended from the centre-right European People’s Party grouping in the European Parliament in March. Mr Salvini would like Fidesz to join his political alliance.

Fidesz is set to win 67 per cent of Hungary’s European Parliament seats. Mr Salvini, whose nationalist League party is polling at more than than 30 per cent, expressed optimism that his nationalist bloc would forge “a new history for Europe and the peoples of Europe” after the vote. 

“If the left continues governing Europe soon we are going to have an Islamic caliphate here,” Mr Salvini said at a news conference. “For our children, to leave behind an Islamic caliphate where cities are governed by sharia law is not something I would like to do, and I am going to do everything in my power to prevent that.”

In remarks that signalled a softening of his previous position, Mr Salvini edged away from his previously-stated view that the EU should redistribute the migrants already in Europe — a measure that Mr Orban staunchly opposes.

“My role is not to send 20 to Budapest, 40 to Lisbon and 30 to Helsinki,” said Mr Salvini. “I want someone to wake up in Brussels and deal with immigration efficiently.”

The Italian deputy premier said he and Mr Orban pledged “to support one another if there are any legal disputes in Brussels”, alluding to the potential launch of proceedings against Hungary which could see Budapest lose its voting rights in the EU.

Although Mr Orban avoided making a firm commitment to support Mr Salvini’s parliamentary grouping, he said that “if the EPP will bind themselves to the European left which is continuously losing the support of the people, whose vision, in our view, is not good for Europe . . . then it will be difficult to find our place in that co-operation”.

Mr Orban repeated his call for the EPP to forge ties with anti-migration parties rather than with “leftist forces”. Referring to his discussions with Mr Salvini, he added that “we agreed that the borders of Europe need to be protected against migrant invasion”.

Mr Salvini’s visit to Budapest was the latest in a series of moves that Mr Orban has made in recent months to build relationships with right-wing allies.

On Monday, he will play host to Austrian vice-chancellor Heinz Christian Strache in Budapest. Mr Strache, who leads the Austrian Freedom party, campaigned on an anti-migrant platform and his government has overseen cuts to benefits for immigrants and asylum seekers.

Markus Söder, leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, which is part of the EPP, said the meeting between Mr Salvini and Mr Orban was a “bad sign”. “It is clear to us that there is no European co-operation with rightwing populists,” said Mr Söder.

Mr Söder said it would be “unacceptable” for the EPP party grouping to co-operate with Marine Le Pen's French National Compact, Mr Salvini’s League or Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD).",,/r/europe/comments/bjz6ji/italys_salvini_woos_orban_to_join_farright/emcex2s/,ShortTrifle0,1556826168

1584,"Well then, I am sorry but Poland is not asking for that money, if this money goes to Poland then that means there is a reson to it right? How does Poland Milk EU? Did Poland ever asked for Money? Please someone elighten me in here.

Why does Brussels Expect Poland to be able to pay the same amount as they recive? Poland is doing good, somehow i guess, but progress is a process that takes TIME, and after being in the iron curtain, it NEEDS time to RECOVER. Someone may point of that Czechia is doing better then Poland and they don't recive so much, but it's not only that. It's also what IS inside this country, and How big it is, Poland is almost 4th times bigger then Czechia, and with that, they also have nice resources, and just overall What you can provide from that country. Do People really expect Poland to be a fucking super-hero of the nations and just rise up from something that was devastating for their Economics, People, State and Other NATIONS? Poland is doing it's BEST to recover (And Also please note that Polish Politicians aren't usually a lot of help). And so is everyone else- I belive there is a reason that Poland recives this money, be it good or bad, but Poland SHOULD SPEND THAT MONEY SO IT CAN recover quicker, but even with that it's a long process!

1591,"Oh I studied economics (and computer science) myself in Frankfurt btw.  My English is of course not on par with yours so I might have difficulties to get things across but im fine thank you. :)

If you looked at my ""little table"" there are also couple of numbers from 2019 some even from april 2019 (while your link was little outdated from march 2019). Those show 0.8% not 0.5%, again your data is outdated. :)

now to the point: the question was: is the UK outperforming Germany economy wise. And you made it sound as if this was of course and obviously the case. It's not. :)
in 2018 germanys gdp growth was 1.5% Uk 1.4%. The forecast for 2019 now is 0.8-1.0% germany 1.4% Uk. so while I agree that Germanys growth decreased still the total gdp and the gdp per capita is higher. uks economy is not outperforming germany economys and is not even close. you'd need a couple of years of way higher growth deficit to achieve that. You know eritrea has also a higher gdp growth than germany but is it outperforming germanys economy? guessed so... 

Then you mention the manufacturing sector... really? after the uk shafted its manufacturing sector so royaly that your whole economy depends solely on london now. even if the recession of the german manufacturing sector (it was on an all time high last year) was as bad as you claim it would still be in MUCH better shape than the Uk manufactoring sector. 

your whole economy is so reliant on sterling. one minor hick up at the stock exchange and your growth forecast goes down the drain.

1605,"I'm going to give you the example of Germany after WW1, which kept printing more and more money to satisfy their foreign debt obligations, leading to an out-of control spiral that caused people to spend their millions, or billions, of marks in wages in a single day because it would half in value the next day. The rate of inflation had to be summarized in a [logarithmic scale](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Germany_Hyperinflation.svg/509px-Germany_Hyperinflation.svg.png), that should tell you something about the rate of inflation.

A similar thing is currently going on in [Venezuela](https://www.wisselkoers.nl/venezolaanse_bolivar), where one Euro would buy you 70 Bolivars in september 2018, but more than 5700 Bolivars now. Historically, 25 out of 29 cases of hyperinflation were [caused by a government printing new money to cover expenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Causes). If a country cannot back its currency with a strong economy, and instead keeps creating ""money"" out of thin air by either printing it or just putting it on bank accounts, that currency is going to decline in value. Simple case of supply and demand.

If Greece were to reinvent their own currency in order to pay their debts, apart from the economic shock that would cause, it would be very hard to let that currency stabilize: in order to stabilize it, the government would have to link its value to another currency, like the Danish are doing with their [Krone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_krone), which is linked to the Euro. Whilst very stable, that would defeat the point of creating it in the first place, as the government could just turn on the presses.

So now, how would you manage to split a broke nation from a large economic zone and re-introduce an unstable currency without the economy imploding?

1699,"&gt; The euro might have issues, but so does every currency.

No.

Take that false equivalency and GTFO.

This is literally like saying ""Saudi Arabia might have human rights issues, but so does the United States.""

&gt;The issues with the eurocrisis were caused by fraudulent Greek finance reports. Transparency and control over the member states' budgets have been severely enhanced.

They were not caused by fraudulent Greek finance reports.  They were caused by western banks leveraging themselves 80, 100, or even as high as 140:1 on bets on pre-Euro Greek debt, because of the implicit guarantee that the Euro makes on the fiscal solvency of its members.

&gt;The majority in every member state that adopted the euro approves of it.

The lay public are idiots.  They're not qualified to talk about the structural issues affecting the Euro.

&gt;In just two decades it became the second most trusted currency in the world, and is on track to beat the dollar.

You are delusional.  The Euro is far behind the dollar and never going to catch up.  It's not even on par with the Yen.  And arguably the RMB has overtaken it.

The Euro deprives countries of two major, MAJOR options for balancing their economy:

1.  The ability to print money.  While yes, it's bad when morons in Zimbabwe do it, when used judiciously, it can devalue a currency to maintain competitiveness (which would be REALLY fucking valuable for Italy and France right about now) or reduce internal debt.  France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Germany, and more have all used this tactic in the past.
2.  Far more important in the long run: independent interest rates.  Is Poland's economy lagging?  Then it can lower interest rates.  Is Poland's economy overheating?  It can raise them.  Is Italy's economy lagging?  It can eat shit.  Is Italy's economy overheating?

While a car is in use, it's also emitting toxic fumes and particles into the air that we breathe. Londoners are rightfully mad at out-of-towners shortening their life spans. Removing millions of parking spots and highways that divide neighborhoods into two makes incredibly large swaths of land free for real estate development. Lower housing costs gives Londoners more disposable income, and healthier, longer lives make them more productive.

France for example doesn't really ackowledge any minority nations or give them extra protections; instead everybody is expected to become French. The UK does recognize some national minorities (like the Scottish or Cornish) but the last census was still mostly about race and there isn't much difference between historical ethnic minorities and more recent immigrant ethnic minorities.

Here those minorities that played an important role in the history or contributed to the culture of Hungary are *minority nations*. They are constituent nations of the country of Hungary but can form their own minority governments and have extra legal protections because they are *in minority*. Immigrant ethnicities don't instantly have these and are expected to integrate. Gypsies were old immigrants in Hungary too but they contributed to Hungarian culture (especially to our music, language and cuisine) and became a national minority because Hungary wouldn't be the same without them - they are an integral part of our country.

The exact details differ from country to country in the region but for example the Romanian electoral law treats minority nations differenty and Hungarians and Italians have the status of indigenous minorities under the Constitution of Slovenia, which guarantees them seats in the National Assembly.

Either way, the attitude differs both from the ""strong integration"" policy and the ""open doors"" policy.

Yeah, people have been claiming for years that the Senate is useless but I think it actually showed it's usefulness especially in the last few years. The current billionaire prime minister for example had expressed wishes to get rid of the Senate as well as changing the electoral system that would suit his party better, but he can't do it because thanks to the Senate where his party only has about 15% of seats, he doesn't have power to do constitutional changes (without wide support from other parties). So one must admire the foresight of those who put this system into place after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

&gt;So does that mean there’s an constant ongoing campaign there? 

I wouldn't call it a constant campaign, it's usually around 2-3 months before each elections.

Sadly we are only building 1 new nuclear power station, even though the technical advice is we can't even meet the 100 grams of CO2 per KWH without many more. Wind and solar is diverting all the investment, which will reduce our emissions, but can't get us anywhere near the old target, let alone zero emissions by 2050.

&gt;I get all my electricity from renewable sources, that costs more personally as well.

If you get your electricity from a ""green"" energy tariff you are getting exactly the same energy mix as people near you on a normal tariff. Green tariffs are, like windmills and solar power, a gesture towards low carbon emissions, but nowhere near enough to avoid the climate catastrophe we are heading for.

No, that's called being a selfish, unethical and immature voter. 
It's not democracy. Democracy is about making things happen, to reach some type of goal that specific body is able to achieve. The EP can't make Brexit happen. 

You are sending the message to the wrong people. Voting in the Brexit Party isn't going to change the UK's parliament. It isn't going to increase the chance of the UK leaving the EU. It's not going to achieve anything besides negative effects for Europeans.

I won't argue the crime rates are higher among Roma Hungarians or Romanians than among non-Roma ones. - because it's true. Big deal, right? Point is, the difference is subjective. Many English people, for instance, believe that the crime rates among white Hungarians and Romanians are much higher than among the English, and that the former 'have completely different culture and don't integrate at all'. In fact, this belief is so widespread that we are leaving the EU (not only for that reason, but let's be honest, this being the major one).

Those people probably dislike the Roma people even more than they dislike white Polish or Hungarians nationals, but thing is, it's just different shades of it for them.

Nonetheless.

The European part of Russia is still far, far, far larger than any other European country. Russia covers like a third of the entire European continent. It also has by far the largest population of any European country. Furthermore Russia has a military that is about as large as that of the rest of Europe combined, and it is the only European military that still has the capability to stage long-term, large-scale deployments to fight wars abroad without outside (read: US) help. Aside from its still tremendous military power, it also has a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, an extremely effective and powerful intelligence network and widespread global influence. Russia, while it is only a pale shadow of the Soviet Union, is the only European country that can still be thought of as a superpower. No other single European country comes anywhere close to wielding that much power. The only countries in the world to exceed Russia in this regard are the US and China, neither of which are in Europe.",Friesland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/bjf39l/today_marks_the_15th_anniversary_of_the_biggest/emb3oly/,GreatRolmops,1556797506

2078,"Nuria de Gispert, former speaker of the Catalan Parliament from 2010 to 2015, has once again insulted the constitutionalist politicians of Catalonia. De Gispert has called Girauta, Arrimadas, Millo and Dolors Montserrat 'pigs.' She has done it in a tweet, sharing the image of a pig drawn under the title ""exports have increased in Catalonia"". 

The rude image refers to the departures of the mentioned politicians to their new destinations as public representatives. ""Girauta to Toledo, Arrimadas to Madriz, Millo to Andalusia, Dolors Montserrat a Europa"", is written in the image.

De Gispert let herself go and ended her tweet with the following sentence: ""For all of you, for those who want dignity to return to our institutions"", adding this comment to a long list of insults and xenophobic disqualifications towards those who do not share her breakaway ideas. 

Girauta, spokesperson for Ciudadanos in the Spanish Parliament, has replied to her words. ""She considers us pigs, and would certainly sacrifice us as such,"" he wrote. ""This is what nationalism does to the weakest minds. We'll meet. I'm not talking about this imbecile, but about the scoundrel who fucked everything up: Artur Mas"".  

Quim Torra honors de Gispert

Ignoring the attitude of De Gispert, former UDC member, Quim Torra has decided to award her with the Cross of Sant Jordi, crediting her work ""in defence of the identity"" of Catalonia. The president of the Catalan government has overlooked the fact that de Gispert was disapproved by the Catalan parliament and fired from the law firm she worked at because of some previous comments. 

This is not the first time she has pointed at Arrimadas. Three days after the illegal referendum, she urged the then leader of Ciudadanos in Catalonia and winner of the regional elections, to leave Catalonia and return ""to her village"". Arrimadas is from Jerez. 

It was the third time that she publicly showed her contempt for the politics of Ciudadanos. It happened after Arrimadas showed Torra a Spanish flag in the Parliament and added, ""Neither you nor anyone else is going to make this flag of Catalonia disappear."" Gispert tweeted shortly after that Arrimadas was ""inept and ignorant. She knows nothing, she must be very ill in Catalonia! She must long for her people! Who forces her to stay here,"" she wrote. 

In January of this year, she did it again. This time she compared Extremadura with Catalonia also on Twitter, accusing the former of not wanting to assume competences because it means ""a lot of work"", and of believing itself to be a ""province"", an example contrary to her region, which aspires, according to her, to be ""a State"".

""An important fact: Extremadura did not want to assume the management of Health or Education, it was a lot of work until they were forced from Madrid in 2004. Catalonia, since 1981. Another great difference between those who believe themselves to be a nation and those who believe themselves to be a province"". 

Later, she defined Catalonia as ""a nation with its own identity, with its own language, history and rights. And we want to be a State"", he added. 

The award of the Cross de Sant Jordi (Saint George's Cross) has given rise to controversy. Torra also poured, in some articles and tweets, some xenophobic comments against the rest of Spaniards. ""The Spaniards only know how to plunder"", ""obviously, we have been busy since 1714"" or ""just kidding. Gentlemen, if we continue here some more of us run the risk of ending up as crazy as the Spaniards"", he would have written between 2010 and 2014.

This year Núria de Gispert will be awarded the Cross of Sant Jordi along Messi or the Slovenian MEP Ivo Vajgl, for his defence of the Catalan separatist movement, among other personalities and entities.",Tabarnia is not Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/bjt0fi/former_speaker_of_the_parliament_of_catalonia/emawiwy/,mdecleves,1556790227

High acidity virgin olive oil you'd use for a salad dressing can be too much, for instance with fish.

Sometimes this culture is too automatic for its own good and people use olive oil when they shouldn't. Imagine you're sauteing idk, beef or salmon, those have fats that don't play well with olive oil IMO. I've been meaning to try grapeseed oil for that, apparently it's very delicate, but I still haven't got around to it.

Of course olive oil chips beat every alternative and you can't have a spanish omelette without it, so you have to learn how to do it.

2121,"&gt;A school friend introduced me to a group of fellow Muslims, and I started hanging out with them in a local Turkish cafe. We’d have conversations where we insulted non-Muslims, talking about how they’d go to hell for being disbelievers. We were hearing more and more about the rise of the so-called Islamic State and we’d talk about joining them. I was naive - I mistakenly saw IS as a force for good, bringing Muslims together from all over the world to live under Islamic rule and take back 'our' lands.

But they're salty, rightly so, at first they believed Nicolas Maduro would be overthrown within a few days after wannabe-putschist Guaido self-declared himself President in January. His 30 days interim period on the brink of expiring they failed with their fake-aid scheme on February 23, one month later. Now they've pulled off the must miserable putsch attempt in history, with the military being unaware it was supposed to pull off a military coup, until Guaido showed up in front of an air force base. No soldiers joined him, the 25 unidentified gunmen that were with Guaido, surrounded him during his speeches, have fled to the Brazilian embassy. Bolsonaro has already granted them asylum. Leopoldo Lopez, Guaido's mentor, fled first to the Chilean, then to the Spanish embassy and is likely to flee the country.

It's not particularly beneficial to Germany. Any benefits that Germany has, other member states have too.

&gt;But it does come at some fairly major costs in terms of domestic policy. Obviously people go on about the ability to devalue (and that's not an unreasonable point) but not being able to set interest rates is fairly critical and would likely be a problem for Poland.

2233,"&gt; Why does Germany and Italy celebrate victory day when they lost?

Very different for Germany and Italy. Germany is easy, it just lost the war in April 1945. As for Italy:

* In July 1943, the King had Mussolini arrested.

* On 3/8 September 1943, Italy [capitulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Cassibile) against the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II). So **The Kingdom of Italy (= Fascist Italy) lost the war in 1943**.

* After the capitulation, the army of the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy) became [co-belligerent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-belligerence) with the Allies. So the Italian [Liberation Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Co-belligerent_Army) of the Kingdom of Italy and the [Partisans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_resistance_movement) were fighting along side the Allies.

* Meanwhile, a Nazi state was formed in Northern Italy, the [Italian Social Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Social_Republic).

* So from September 1943 until the end of WWII, Italy was in a civil war.

* Around 25-28 April 1945, The Kingdom of Italy (+partisans and Allies) defeated the Italian Social Republic and the Nazis So **The Kingdom of Italy won the war in 1945, and the Italian Social Republic (the Nazi-Fascist puppet state) lost it**.

* After a referendum in 1946, the Kingdom of Italy became the current Republic of Italy, which is a legal descendent of the Kingdom of Italy and of Fascist Italy (until 1943), but not a legal descendent of the Italian Social Republic. 

So, technically, the Italian State lost a war in September 1943 (as the Kingdom of Italy = Fascist Italy against the Allies), and won a second war in April 1945 (as the Kingdom of Italy + Allies against the Italian Social Republic + Nazis). This is why Italy celebrates 25 April 1945 (the day that Milan and Turin were liberated) but not 3/8 September 1943 (the day Italy capitulated against the Allies).


TL;DR. Germany lost WWII in 1945. Italy lost one war in 1943, and won another one in 1945. Italy celebrates the victory of 1945, not the defeat of 1943.",,/r/europe/comments/bji1ur/when_european_countries_celebrate_victory_in/emartda/,CF_FIRE,1556783884

2240,"Your problem is you jump into premature conclusions based on text where I haven't explicitly nor indirectly stated (NOR in any way mentioned the Russian government as a whole, merely mentioning the steps Putin decided) what I think of the Russian government. I expected lots of responses, but not this one. I don't even know what to think of it. 

But sure, the economic shock therapy and other badly organized efforts in Russia led by Western advisers that were even moreso botched up by the locals created tons of oligarchs, crime and mafia, which effectivelly spilled over into politics, making strength an important factor in the domestic politics of Russia. 

I wouldn't say they are dumbasses, do not generalize. Some of them are, as some politicians spit nonsense that the media here love to portray as an official statement of Russia itself (but misinformation should only concern when it's directed against us, not against Russia or Russians, right? it's how journalism with an agenda works). Others are borderline geniuses and smart people, and lately, the Russian government has been made up of actual technocrats, utilitarian (economy-wise) people whose goal is to make Russia as stable as possible, actually forcing it to change by creating mildly hard times and budget deficits in economy (forcing the budget on 40$ oil [it's over 65$ as of now, all the rest of money goes into state coffers]), buying up gold and hoarding foreign reserves. If it was run by incompetent criminal dumbasses we'd have seen it by now, with Russia plunging into total chaos after people decided Putin screwed up big time, with the economy crumbling into nothingness. Instead, Russia has expanded in geopolitics heavily, from Libya to Syria, Venezuela, Vietnam, the African continent etc., it has connected with Crimea, is building several gas pipelines both into European mainland, Turkey and China, is building numerous nuclear powerplants across the globe effectively creating a nuclear monopol, has created the world's first hypersonic missiles both in jets and ships and in the form of ICBM (though this is still under testing, surely) and the list goes on. 

For a country that has the economy of Italy (another misinformation spread by American congressmen and rebarked by clueless anti-Russian European politicians), Russia is doing much more and is much more proactive in its policies and reforms than any other European country. But I agree, if there weren't such idiots in their government (and in our governments and in the EP), it would've been way better off by now.",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/bjdow2/poland_has_replaced_russia_as_the_top_destination/emarvx0/,daLok1nho,1556783959

2376,"I can kind of understand shortening the period of time.

Like say I move to a new EU member each month.

If I understand correctly, moving means that I cannot vote in the place where I lived.  But the registration process requires a delay before I can vote in the place I moved *to*, because registration cannot happen immediately before the vote.  So I cannot vote in either country.

There are certain areas of work, like fruit-picking, where I suspect that people move to whatever is in season, and may require frequent moves.  So it's not *totally* insane to think that one can never vote in the area where one lives.

That being said, if I understand correctly, an EU citizen always has the option to vote in the country of his citizenship in the EP.  And I don't see how they can be deprived there — a Romanian citizen abroad can surely just vote as Romanian.

And I'm unsympathetic to the idea that rapidly-moving voters are an independent ""country"" that require separate representation.

Also, much of the existing 4G physical infrastructure has Huawei parts making straight upgrades to 5G cheaper than switching.

http://fortune.com/2019/04/24/us-huawei-ban-uk/

&gt;***Like Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom is terrified of the implications of a full-on Huawei ban. Both companies have warned that such a move could set back 5G deployments by as much as two years, particularly if they were also forced to rip out and replace the Huawei equipment they have already installed for today’s 4G networks. Vodafone’s Read also argued that it would be bad for the European telecoms industry to be limited to only two suppliers—apart from Huawei, the other two big vendors are Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson.***

&gt;***Huawei itself is complicating matters for carriers that have already used its gear in their 4G networks, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson recently warned. Stephenson noted last month that Huawei’s 4G equipment is only interoperable with the company’s own 5G products. That’s an issue because 5G phones will also need to be able to connect to 4G networks for as long as it takes before 5G coverage is ubiquitous—and that will take many years.***

There is a gap between wanting to change your environment for the better, or even wanting to do what is possible to reverse/halt/minimise the impact of climate change (delete as appropriate in terms of viability..), and thinking that X is going to cause the end of all human existence.

I don't need to think that the human race will perish to want to do something about climate change, or indeed about other environmental impacts, indeed I'd argue that claiming that it is likely to isn't well supported by the evidence.

2499,"&gt; Do you think that it is a good thing or bad thing all around?

I think that it tends to limit the UK's potential impact geopolitically.  Ditto for the EU, to a lesser extent.

&gt; Do you think it is going to be good for the UK?

I think that relative to being in a well-run EU, the UK will be poorer for leaving.  Obviously, the EU could be badly run, but that's true of any government.

Whether it's ""good"" or not depends on making certain value calls.

I do not think that it is likely to be an effective way to address concerns over immigration, which were a significant part of what drove it.

It will almost certainly aid in retaining British sovereignty, though it's not at all clear to me that doing this actually has the effects that many people might expect.

It will permit for greater British latitude in trade, but will probably lead to an overall reduction in trade, and normally the aim in having more freedom to set trade policy is to facilitate trade.

It creates several difficult problems — the Irish border and some legal issues.  It will create a certain amount of job loss in the near term.

My view is that British diplomats had secured for the UK a fairly favorable position, and that they desired to retain that position and that the public did not want it.

I do not think that it will be a disaster — the visions of *Mad Max* Brexit Britain that a certain contingent have been promoting are ludicrous.

I think that no matter what associations are established, the UK and the EU-27 will interact to some measure, and looking at, say, Swiss complaints, I am not sure that British will be entirely happy with being on the outside.

&gt; Do you think it is going to be bad for the rest of the EU?

I think that most people applauding it are simply engaging in sour grapes.  I see very little to like about it from the EU's position.

* It eliminates a well-to-do, economically-capable, militarily-powerful member who brought little political baggage to the EU, had an economically-liberal outlook, and had considerable diplomatic clout.

* It reduces how ""bad"" it is to be outside the EU in that now there is another country to associate with.  Because any state may leave at will, the authority that Brussels has is bounded by how much better things are inside than out.  The UK leaving makes it less-good in, more-good out.  Le Pen and similar have to be treated more carefully now.

* Militarily, it creates an unknown factor on the border.  It hampers locking down the Strait of Gibraltar, which is an EU interest.  The UK represented a considerable chunk of EU power projection capability.

* Politically, it eliminates ""momentum"".  It represents a failure to manage the EU politically, which is ultimately at the core if any political entity.

* It will likely be hard to reverse.

The economic hit will be smaller in proportional terms than it will be for the UK, though for members who are hit particularly hard (Ireland, the Netherlands) it will be no fun.

&gt; Do you know why the UK intends to leave (i dont)?

Based on polling, immigration and sovereignty were top concerns.

That is, people had been promised far less immigration than actually occurred.  Most countries do not like a high rate of immigration.  Many people who voted Leave were in a position of being concerned about competition for jobs.

And many people did not want the UK to wind up entering into an ever-closer union, probably ultimately winding up becoming a country.  The EU as an area that traded together was popular with Britons.  The EU as a good deal more was not (though I think that some of the fears as to what this might mean are ill-founded).

&gt; )? To be honest the way the UK government has handled it seems like an absolute shambles but does it seem that way from an outside perspective?

Not from mine.  Well, May gambled on getting a strong Tory majority in the 2017 general election, and that didn't work out, but many people on /r/ukpolitics thought that she was going to succeed right up until right before the vote, so that wasn't just her.  And honestly, that's more a Tory problem than a British problem.

I'd have extended a fig leaf on at least things like permitting continued residence of EU citizens sooner, unilaterally.  I don't think that there was ever any real chance of either side doing anything but letting people stay, and that would have helped a number of individuals plan.  Also, after the UK did unilaterally make statements, other EU countries started doing so.

And I think that there is a certain level of dishonesty towards the public on the part of all the negotiators that is disappointing, particularly over the Irish border.

But I think that complaints that the UK ""does not know what it wants"" are bogus and represent a political narrative.  Parliament is not confused and is not paralyzed, and May is not simply clueless about what to do, which has been the image generally sold.  As far as I can tell on the outside, policy has been about as sane as one can reasonably expect, given that some confusion was inevitable.  I do not find Grayling's expenditure to reserve ferry capacity, May not providing a detailed set of promises as to what Brexit should look like, May not ruling out no-deal, or any number of other things which I've seen the press excoriate the UK for to be bad moves.

I cannot think of a major policy action that the UK could unilaterally take that I'd endorse that would greatly improve the Brexit process that it has not, at least as can be seen from the outside.

The problem is that most don't read anymore. At best they catch the blurbs on social media. It's no coincidence that the rise of political news television began in the mid-1990s, just when the modern era of hyper-partisanship was getting off the ground. If you only watch Fox News and see Breitbart posts on your facebook feed, you have a completely different worldview from someone who only watches MSNBC and sees Jacobin on their twitter. 

I agree that there's a huge amount of misinformation about life in the US among Europeans. I encounter it all the time discussing life with my politically engaged European friends.

2524,"&gt;Firstly, companies can cut their costs with or without a devalued currency.

never said they couldn't, and it's not like they have control over that anyway, they just end up either suffering or beneffiting from whatever their government does


&gt;Secondly, relying on your domestic market is more expensive than relying on an international market. If Greece were to have moved their production from abroad to the domestic market, inflation would also have occurred.

I'm not denying this, I'm just saying if you're in a position where you're barely selling anything even if you're not concentrating on your exports, you might devalue just so you can sell more exports anyway. anyway, the main issue here isn't whether devaluing your currency works or not, but whether a country gets its own say or joins the euro


&gt;Third, countries will a lower standard of living like Greece benefit from countries like Germany with a higher standard of living, because they can produce cheaper and sell for more. Germen workers aren't competitive compared to Greece ones. What is competitive though is German infrastructure. Your argument that rich countries can make higher quality products is nonsense because to them, given the same circumstances, producing a product is more expensive than in a country with a lower cost of living.

yes in terms or labourers german workers are clearly more expensive, but in terms of exports germany flies very high. It is possible that germany has certain goods that it makes which can be sold globally at a competitive rate due to their devalued currency whilst having relatively expensive workers. for example, germany are known for good cars, so they are selling a premium good for a little cheaper than it should be.


greece on the other hand will struggle to be able to afford the human and physical capital required to make premium goods despite having the cheap labour, but they wouldn't have the funds to afford all of the resources anyway.


&gt;Different EU countries have different minimum wages. This means poorer countries can produce goods cheaper and then sell them more expensively in rich countries. 

they can only produce goods cheaper if they can afford the capital and labour to produce said goods, I'm sure that FoM coupled with free trade can make that tricky with foreign business able to operate anywhere within the single market at a rate that's cheap for them abut expensive for the locals.


&gt;This would not be possible without a single currency.

errr china and india?


&gt;The lower developped countries are the ones that benefit the most from the EU. Their growth has been astronomical, especially when compared to their peers that did not join the EU. The main disadvantage they have is that their infrastructure is not very attractive. Programmes like the structural investment fund aim to make these countries catch up.

I don't disagree that other EU countries have benefitted economically although I haven't looked into the details much, but I guess germany doing well can lead to some supply side like benefits",England,/r/europe/comments/bjktl3/brussels_tells_poland_eu_is_not_a_cow_you_can_milk/ema9keb/,grandnew,1556766313

Salt is very necessary for our bodies, and following the US guidelines is more likely to actually get you sick. In Europe, during the heatwaves, many elderly people who also happened to be instructed by medical practioners to consume less salt ended up dying during the heatwaves. You need enough salt and water to survive high temperatures, and to just function properly.

If you don't consume enough salt, your kidneys secret insulin to hold onto whatever it has. That insulin will cause you to gain weight. If you consume too much salt, but you consume it over the course of a day (like our ancestors did), you would pee it out because your kidneys wouldn't hold onto any of it. 

Salt consumption and fat consumption have only gone down, yet heart disease is constantly on the rise. I'd like you to explain how this is possible.

""Hobson's early works contain strongly [antisemitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism) language.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson#cite_note-Allett-1)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson#cite_note-Cowen-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson#cite_note-Marks-8) In the 1890s he blamed Jewish immigrants from the [Russian Partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Partition) for harming the well-being of native workers and advocated limitations on immigration. Writing on the South African war in *War in South Africa* (1900), he tied the war to ""Jew Power"" and saw [Johannesburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg) as a ""New Jerusalem"". Hobson claimed ""[Jewish financiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitic_canard#Controlling_the_world_financial_system)"", whom he saw as ""parasites"", manipulated the British government that danced to their ""diabolical tune"".[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson#cite_note-10) According to history professor Norman Etherington the section of financiers in *Imperialism* seems irrelevant to Hobson's economic discourse, and was probably included since Hobson truly believed it.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson#cite_note-Etherington-11) Hobson was innovative in tying between 1898 and 1902 the concept of [modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity), empire, and Jews together; according to Hobson the international financiers imposed their will by exerted control via Jewish press ownership in South Africa and London.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson#cite_note-Feldman-12)""   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\_A.\_Hobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hobson)",,/r/europe/comments/bjfeni/jeremy_corbyn_rejects_antisemitism_claim_over/em9svg0/,BillyJoeMac9095,1556754998

Basically, pro-EU Icelanders haven't really been able to muster a majority in favor of joining so staying out is the normal situation for the time being. Iceland only initiated a formal EU application because the aftershock of the 2008 meltdown brought a pro-EU party into power, which then managed to push through parliament the decision to apply even though the public sort for it was mellow and set to dwindle once the economy got back on its feet. A few years later the Euro-skeptic conservatives got back into power and decided to ""suspend"" the application process, with no-one really knowing what that meant. It's ceasefire for now and pro-EU factions just bide their time hoping they'll one day be able to get public support and enough power in parliament to restart the application process.

That's just complete bullshit. 

The economy of Greece is no greater than a rounding error in the greater Eurozone. How can one little country cause so much instability?

The eurocrisis was caused by structural issues that let German, Dutch and French banks buy Greek and other weaker economies bonds (which now paid lower yields post-EZ) in such a volume that rivaled the banks' host countries GDP. Then, Western Europe decided to bail out their banks with taxpayers funds and scapegoat Greece for political reasons. 

Everyone in Europe knew Greece was not as politically stable nor having the checks-and-balances of Western Europe *well before the crisis,* so the fact nobody stopped corrupt Western Euro banks from leveraging on debt up to their eyeballs proves the systematic failure of the EZ vis-a-vis banking regulations and current account balancing.",Australia,/r/europe/comments/bjktl3/brussels_tells_poland_eu_is_not_a_cow_you_can_milk/em9tcbc/,admiralasprin,1556755294

and I'm extremely irritated, I might say ""Kaj je, kurba?"".
Note that I am not calling that person a whore, I am just

* If it's very cold outside I might say ""mrzlo je kot kurba"",
which literally means ""it's cold like a whore"". Same thing
if it's very hot, rainy, dark or whatever. Basically you can
emphasize how extreme any state or property of anything is by
likening it to kurba.
* You can say ""Kurba, no!"" to express disapproval, which would
be used in a similar way as ""Come on!"" or ""Fuck, man!"" in English.
* You can also use a verb ""kurbati"". This literally means whoring,
but can also be used in other ways. For example ""tam notri se

We are grateful as Poles for all the countries that are chipping in. But you do have to learn that in general EU structural funds are only fraction of national budget. In fact EU spending represents less than 1% of the total value of the EU economy. Poland took advantage of structural funds better than most other countries in EU. And the benefit is clearly visible.

So.... national issues like I said.

&gt;Maybe it works differently in the Netherlands, but just making up shit and giving around blame based on that (whether it is directed towards muslims, local authorities, the EU, soros or whatever) are certainly considered populistic here and I think you would likely be shunned as a populisitic loon if you ever tried to spout your fallacy-riddled arguments here.

Except I told you a dozen times now where I base my arguments on. Stop pretending I make shit up. I gave you the explanations, I gave you the link. 

&gt; I have asked multiply times about the source for the 95% claim, but instead I have gotten tons and tons of text with everything from why people vote on anti-EU parties to brexit.

Told you multiple times. Literally just gave you a link about Brexit where you can see the leave vote was supported by bullshit and national issues.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; U.S. Air Forces Europe would not comment on future basing or force structure changes, but expanding training with the Greeks appears to be in the works regarding INIOHOS 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Last year, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis teased the idea of an increased military presence in Greece for U.S. forces. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; “It’s very important for Greece that the United States deploy military assets in Greece on a more permanent base, not only in Souda Bay but also in Larissa, in Volos, in Alexandroupoli,"" Greek Defense Minister Panagiotis Kammenos said during his October meeting with Mattis. 

*( Alexandroupoli is a port near the Greek-Turkish border and Volos is a port near the Aegean Sea. U.S. Navy vessels frequently dock at Souda Bay on the Greek island of Crete. U.S. Air Force pilots have also flown training operations from Souda Bay in the past. )*

2901,"&gt; As an expert panel of researchers convened by the National Academy of Sciences noted in a 1993 report: ""The distinction between homosexual and heterosexual child molesters relies on the premise that male molesters of male victims are homosexual in orientation. Most molesters of boys do not report sexual interest in adult men, however"" (National Research Council, 1993, p. 143, citation omitted).

Seems to be a bit more complicated than that. 

&gt; The distinction between a victim's gender and a perpetrator's sexual orientation is important because many child molesters don't really have an adult sexual orientation. **They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults, either men or women. Instead, their sexual attractions focus on children – boys, girls, or children of both sexes.**

Applying the concepts of heterosexuality and homosexuality from relationships between adults to cases of child molestation even seem to be a fallacy on its own.

So were the 80s, with shortages of basic products in shops, devaluation of the dinar etc.

But Slovenia could introduce it unilaterally if it needed it, that's what independence is about - you can decide what is good or bad for your country itself and you don't need a confirmation from Belgrade. 

&gt; They also invested into other parts of the country, vineyards in Kosovo for example.

And what happened to it, did Serbs nationalize this property or introduced export duties? It's not that leaving Yugoslavia cut all ties between the republics, just like it didn't happen after the dissolution of the USSR.

In regard to Poland - good point about the history - many people are interested in that context for the travel. 

Me - I knew Poland pretty well. For many years summer was the Baltic sea and sailing - lakes, and winter - skiing. And regular travel to most of the regions - sometimes for work, sometimes for fun. But I almost don't do that anymore. If I want a beach in the summer - I prefer to go to Algarve. Skiing - Alps are better. Weekend trip - Barcelona or Paris flight are faster than the trip to Krakow from Warsaw. And better - at least for me.

This is by far you best point. Belgium scores below the bar compared to surrounding countries. People seem to forget that democracy is a verb, living together without a dictator forcing you takes work on a personal level.

However, simply being diverse, and having group-specific customs, is not a recipe for disaster. There are many examples of that working out, and you'll notice that where it does, participation across the board in the broader community is key. Brussels indeed has extra difficulty because the ('native') Belgians were busy with their own language war.

It's probably easier to blow up a diverse city with hatred and polarization than a monocultural one, but that does not and should not imply it is therefore less stable.

3234,"&gt;He refers to them as such because that's literally how they're called by modern historiography. Medieval Western Europeans themselves generally refered to the Byzantines as ""the Greeks"".

I know this, and truth be told both modern and medieval historiography was wrong about this. The Byzantines did not identify as Greek, don’t make me repeat myself.

Btw the Byzantines referred to most Catholic Europeans as ‘Franks’, does that sound to you like something that modern historiography should follow? Those labels should be dismissed because they are wrong.

&gt;and culturally Greek.

Interesting. ‘Culturally Greek’. We’re talking about the same people who banned the Olympics and destroyed countless of Greek temples? These people were culturally Greek? Or maybe you mean culturally Orthodox?

&gt;as the entire region had been slowly (but partially) hellenized for a thousand years, starting in the 4th century BC.

Yeah and most of Roman territories were Latinized gradually. Did those Roman subjects became Latins? 

Greek was like the lingua franca of those times, speaking it didn’t make you a Greek. 

&gt;There very much was a Greek identity, not only by 1704, but even centuries before. Greek nationalism, like any other nationalism, is rooted in cultural self-identification. That culture didn't pop out of thin void in the 19th century.

The article keeps mentioning ‘Greeks’, but as we already know, that’s how western Europeans called them, not how they called themselves. 

An example is that important Greek figure of the Greek independence war did not mention the words Greeks or Hellenes in his poems. An example:

&gt;In ""Thourios"" he urged the Greeks (Romioi) and other orthodox Christian peoples living at the time in the general area of Greece (Arvanites, Bulgarians, etc.[14][15]) to leave the Ottoman-occupied towns for the mountains, where they might experience more freedom.

&gt;It is noteworthy that the word ""Greek"" or ""Hellene"" is not mentioned in ""Thourios""; instead, Greek-speaking populations in the area of Greece are still referred to as ""Romioi"" (i.e. Romans, citizens of the Christian or Eastern Roman Empire), which is the name that they proudly used for themselves at that time.[16]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigas_Feraios

Again, I don’t deny that a Greek identity eventually rose, but it most probably happened pretty lately, like the 18th century.

&gt;There was, in fact, a Greek kingdom in India, a stem of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, itself a remnant of the conquest of Alexander the Great.

Here’s what you don’t get: a historian, like what that dude is supposed to be, should not ‘play’ with wording. That kingdom wasn’t Greek, it was *Hellenistic*, since it was run by Greeks, but most citizens and arguably culture was local. 

His channel aims for a Western audience, and he knows that by claiming that there were Western ‘kingdoms’ as far as India in the Antiquity, he’s going to get clicks and likes.

&gt;Your car factory can be only a third as productive as your wages are lower.

Again nope. The value gained barely reaches the factory at all and it is instead transferred to other branches of the company that owns the factory. Then again it is reinvested in different places. That is what owning the value chain means. Really.

&gt;And besides that you are clearly delusional if you think you would have been better off without outside investment.

3272,"&gt; Yeah, after the Bolshevik victory, the first thing they did was to pour Georgians into Abkhazia, radically altering the demographic picture in 4 years (in 2 years actually, because Stalin factually came to power in 1924, after Lenin) without any records of violence

No, but one of the things Stalin have done after seizing the power was altering populations. Sure this wasn't a thing done in first two years only.

Also, Russian Empire continued to oppress Abkhazians until 1914, and they continued to flee and leave until that period.

&gt; In reality, the first thing the Bolsheviks did after taking Tbilisi was to remove Abkhazian AR from Georgia (1921)

It wasn't in Georgia really to begin with, and they didn't want to. It was within the Mountainous Republic, but Georgia declared it theirs.

&gt; So no, Bolsheviks were in no way in favour of Georgians in that time.

Stalin did. Let's not forget how the country was given to Georgia and how it was treated under Georgian SSR, and how Georgians were sent there in masses to settle, while Abkhaz were oppressed.

Look, I don't have anything against Georgians. I even like them, especially Svans. I also find Georgia righteous when it comes to South Ossetia. But there is a reason why every nation in North Caucasus sympathised with Abkhaz in the conflict, even if they disliked Russian policies to the core.

&gt; 2 centuries before that, Abkhazians cleansed Megrelians out of there, how far will you get with that logic? The whole middle ages was suffering for common folk, but what relevance does it have today in this context?!

There is none, but the Stalin and Beria policies, and the Georgian SSR are sure relevant. They're why Georgians became the majority, other than issues with the Russian Empire. Same goes for the early Georgian leaders' attitudes just after the independence. It was them push Abkhazia to independence.

&gt; The debate is about the Russians creating a conflict by manipulation of demographics which in this case resulted in very violent wars less than 30 years ago, and very ugly processes which continue till today.

Altering the demographics by the Russians started with the mass expulsion of Abaza, and Soviet policies to settle Georgians there. Yet that's something that makes Abkhaz righteous, not Georgia from that very point.

&gt; To downplay this, you bring up past struggles and sufferings of Abkhazians.. 

I'm not downplaying anything but saying things aren't like Crimea, where Russians put Russians and declare the place theirs. 

&gt; Who the fuck cares who had the upper hand? Does it seem like the Russian political elites give a shit about either Abkhazians or Georgians, or even Russians for that matter? Their goals have always been political gains, not the well-being of people.

You then have the motivation to act, so whatever the reasons in the background, you ARE a good person; if you didn't care or help you would not be a bad person, but you do.


My selfish pleasure is an easy one; every day I pay a compliment to a random stranger. It has to be a genuine complment or it doesn't there's work at all, so you can't be dishonest. There is always something to compliment,  hair, lipstick, perfume, shoes, eyes, clothing - this goes for men as well as women, young and especially old. Think about an 80 year old woman, how many years if not decades it is since she had anyone pay her a compliment. Telling her that she smells really nice or that her shoes or coat is nice, or that her scarf is very pretty, or that her eyes look very beautiful or kind or since will definitely make her day,  but you really have to mean it when you say it.  At first, they are almost always taken aback, a little bit shocked, but as they realise you really mean it, the smile starts spreading across their face. You get the double whammy of knowing that you've just brightened their day a little on the spot, and know that they will be in a good mood for at least a few hours, if not the whole day. Knowing I've done that to someone makes my day a litte brighter and puts me in a good mood for hours.

Selfish? Yes. But I've been doing it for almost 30 years now, and it helps me if I'm feeling a bit down; just to see the smile starting is enough to raise my mood, so I'm not going to stop. It doesn't make me a bad person, just as you helping out because you'll feel bad if you don't  doesn't make you a bad person. Just make sure people don't take advantage of your kindness.

3409,"Sorry for late reply. I completely forgot and got sidetracked until someone else just now replied to me in this thread.

&gt;The states already have a very strong representation in the senate, where they can express their opinions. They do not need other means of power. And every state is equal in the senate as well, with each state having two representatives. As to your argument where you got the rust belt as an example, you're right, maybe Hillary wouldn't have been able to emphatize with them. Maybe she did not have a clue. But it doesn't matter. Because in the end, more people wanted her as president and not Trump.

More people from california and new york wanted her as president. It makes sense if we know how when many humans group up together in different geographies they tend to assimilate to a cohesive whole. You take a part of the population that voted for Hillary in California and put them in a midwestern state at least a quarter of them change their voting habits based on newly found concerns. I am not sure if you know this but we as a nation have been through what happened in 2016 before.

In the late nineteenth century Grover Cleveland won the popular vote for his presidential bid. He went to the more populated southern states and held rallies there. He did not do much in the north. Subsequently, he lost the presidential election based on losing the electoral college. He only tried to address 2 big groups of people down in the south. He ignored the north. A similiar thing hillary did in 2016. She ignored many regions and chose to address the biggest ones. The electoral college worked as intended. Hillary only cared addressing concerns for those who live in states with huge cities such as California or New York so of course she won the popular vote. Just address the biggest group in the whole US and you win the popular vote. It is an extremely easy strategy. Is it one that gives you legitimacy to the highest office in the country though? Why should anyone especially a small state with a small population join a union where only the biggest groups win?

The US has lasted under 240 years of this system. It has only been called into question once and that resulted into a civil war. The EU has only been around for 20 years and already one of it's major countries is leaving the Union. Italy in the next decade has a small chance to as well and then who knows what else is coming up.

&gt;The various groups also have the house where they can elect representatives whose sole job is to represent these small groups.

States get their representatives by population and electoral votes which is why a big state like California has 53 representatives out of 435. They would have a much bigger number if the electoral system was abolished and one state or two states could decide federal policy for the rest of the 48. Why would a small state join such a union with no electoral system in place? It wouldn't make sense. 

&gt;The president however represents the whole of the US, not just some groups. 

Exactly. He or she shouldn't represent just californians or new yorkers because they are the biggest. Hillary did not win the popular vote for most states, only a few of the biggest. Why should she be entitled to the presidency because of that?

&gt;And a country who breaks apart just because of some differences is a broken country really. Might as well break apart if the various groups cannot accept that the majority is against them. But I remember the last time some states tried that you guys massacred them, so there's that.

Netherlands - The most catchy, I thought. It may be a bit generic but it was a good choice in my opinion. I felt like you took it seriously and that warrants points. 

Iceland - The most memorable. Even though I am not a fan of these kinds of vocals, everything else was great. A bit provocative but not in a try-too-hard or edgy way (contrary to others... cough cough).

Arab countries - No translation provided (and this meant it was a nope for me, for all the others who did the same) but hey I thought it was good. The music was nice, money was spent on this video. 

Poland - Normally not exactly my cup of tea because I found it a bit too cheesy and it sounds too much to what we can hear on the radio all year round. But, once again, I appreciate that it's a serious contender. I'd much rather give points to this kind of suggestions...

Albania - Generic love pop song but the voices were nice (except autotune guy in the last part of the song). The video was better than most. I appreciate a simple song that doesn't  pretend to reivent the wheel &amp;  also doesn't take itself too seriously. 

Then it was difficult. I honestly felt too lazy to listen to them again in order to decide their order so consider you all have 5 points from me (it's not that serious after all). 

Belarus 

Russia 

Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina 

Venezuela

Uruguay/Central America

I'm gonna be blunt, I know everyone has his or her own tastes and preferences and that's fine, mine is that all these meme songs were a real pain in the ass. I did not enjoy this edition as much as the previous ones because of that and hesitated to listen to the entire playlist and go through the entire process of voting. 

I have nothing against meme songs, I have nothing against a good laugh, but I simply thought these weren't good. In my opinion they were cringy, immature and repetitive. I did not care for any of them at all. They made me angry. (We'll see what voters say overall. I just wanted to express my views). 

And also: if you don't provide a translation (&amp; there are no subtitles on the youtube video), your song better have something that catches my attention during the first 40 seconds or I'm not going to bother with you.

_____________________________________________________

Poland has replaced Russia as the top destination of Ukrainian goods during the first quarter of 2019, according to Ukraine’s state fiscal agency.

During this period, Ukraine has exported $818 million worth of goods to Poland, against $759 million to Russia. This constitutes a milestone in Ukraine’s trading history as Russia has been the top importer of Ukrainian goods since Ukraine gained its independence in 1991.

Among the top five destinations for Ukrainians exports during the first quarter are Egypt with $652 million, followed by China with $640 million and Turkey with $638 million.

Ukrainian companies have exported a total of $12.3 billion worth of goods since the beginning of the year, which constitutes a seven percent increase compared to the same period last year.

These dynamics might change however throughout the rest of the year depending on the country’s trade relations and performance. The low Russia export figure could also be a reflection of Russia’s embargo on Ukrainian imports – over 50 agricultural and industrial products – which Moscow put into place in December 2018.

Numbers could go even lower during the second quarter as Moscow’s second and latest ban of Ukrainian imports – worth approximately $250 million – comes into force on June 1.
But despite Russia’s increasingly aggressive trade war, Ukraine continues to boost its global exports.

With $4 billion worth of exports in January, Ukraine currently has a trade surplus of $20.9 million, according to Ukraine’s Economy Ministry.

Year-over-year, exports have grown by 9.2 percent, with agricultural products and ferrous metals leading the way. These goods made up around 60 percent of total exports during January and have earned Ukraine a total $2.45 billion.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bjdow2/poland_has_replaced_russia_as_the_top_destination/em7ej5o/,FriendOfOrder,1556692272

3590,"Pretty sure the Cossacks have a disputed or unknown origin. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks

- Max Vasmer's etymological dictionary traces the name to the Old East Slavic word козакъ, kozak, a loanword from Cuman, in which cosac meant ""free man"", from Turkish/Turkic languages quazzaq rabble rouser, trouble maker, fugitive, outcast rebel, from Tatar languages Kazak skinny bollard [12] The ethnonym Kazakh is from the same Turkicroot.[13][14][15] In modern Turkish it is pronounced as ""Kazak"".
In written sources the name is first attested in Codex Cumanicus from the 13th century.[16][17] In English, ""Cossack"" is first attested in 1590.[13]

- Early ""Proto-Cossack"" groups are generally reported to have come into existence within the present-day Ukraine in the mid-13th century as the influence of Cumans grew weaker, though some have ascribed their origins to as early as the tenth century.[19] Some historians suggest that the Cossack people were of mixed ethnic origins, descending from Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Turks, Tatars, and others who settled or passed through the vast Steppe.[20]However some Turkologists argue that Cossacks are descendants of native Cumans of Ukraine, who lived there long ago before the Mongol invasion.[21]",,/r/europe/comments/bj2pmh/reply_of_the_zaporozhian_cossacks_to_mehmed_iv_by/em78oll/,GeldimGordumGetdim,1556685176

The only way that we (as in, Bulgaria and Romania and also Hungary and so on) can get rid of corruption is that we (as in, ""we the people"") stop turning a blind eye to it. It is happening very, very slowly, and the process is actively hampered by the EU. By ""actively hampered"" I mean that there is ""money for nothing"" coming from the general direction of the EU, and this money is just feeding the corruption from above. Everybody knows it and no one gives a flying shit about it.

The only real change will come from below, that is, from us (as in, you and me).

Don't get me started on the EU. It almost feels like end-game by now. The level of political illiteracy of the general population in the founding states (Germany, France, Italy...) is very low and it has still declined in the past decade. It was never high in the rest of what is the EU at the moment.

Proportionally, Germany got off very, *very* lightly compared to all the damaged it dished out. Had there been a nuclear barrage targeting every city with over 500k people, the difference might have been less lopsided.

But this is where it got us now.

4082,"&gt; Where does the responsibility end? 

There is no objective answer to that. Especially not in our system of international relations where essentially, geopolitics very often triumphs over the international law. Sometimes, you have to bear no responsibility, sometimes you have to bear it decades after the deed was done.

But essentially the answer to the question of how long can you expect to be 'reminded' of your responsibility by the other side is - as long as there is enough people who care about it and who feel that you still have some responsibility. And evidently that still is the case in the Polish society.

And no, I don't think PiS has some magical power to keep this issue relevant even +100 years from now. Eventually people will stop care, it will happen at some point.

&gt; From that perspective, Germany could probably do more for the rememberance of those victims.

The thing is though that this isn't only about the individual victims which is kinda ironic, because ultimately of course it should primarely be about the human suffering.

But of course, we humans can get quite strongly attached to many 'higher concepts', we are not just attached to other human beings. On the contrary, as you say, most of the people who lost someone in the WW2 are dead by now. The reason why there are still such strong emotions around this issue is that WW2 for us was an attack on our statehood, on us as a nation group, quite literaly we as a society were supposed to stop existing in this part of Europe.

In a country like Poland, which went through several existentional traumas in the modern history, this hurts very very deep. You occupied countries in the Western Europe too, but you never aimed to destroy the French society completely, you never planned to destroy the Dutch or the Danish society completely, but you did plan to and you took steps to destroy the fabric of our societies.

And this is something that even today's generations of Poles or Czechs can get upset about when they think about it. We can't get upset about our relatives being killed anymore, but we can get upset about our society being ruined.

Of course it does not help that the 20th century had other 'great' things prepared for us, not just the WW2, which prevented the normal healing procedure. So yes, while it may seem like it is a long time ago now, the actually process of reconciliation really just started after 89, because the communist regimes had no interest in preparing the societies for a reconciliation. On the contrary (most of) you were in the enemy camp, so people were supposed to see you as a enemy.

Either way, thanks for the conversation. You are right, it was nice talking to you again.

https://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/

By the end of this decade, there will be more Muslims in the UK than the entirety of the United States despite the US having over 5 times the population. 

&gt;Christianity is still by far the biggest religion here.

No one in the UK follows the religion, they're just culturally Christian (and even that is doubtful given the hedonistic lifestyle).

&gt;The number of people attending the Church of England’s Sunday services fell again last year, to 722,000 – 18,000 fewer than in 2016 – continuing a trend seen over recent decades

&gt;THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, MEETING WITHIN THE COUNCIL,

&gt;recalling that the Heads of Governments meeting in Paris on 9 and 10 December 1974 requested that the possibility of creating a Passport Union and, in advance, the introduction of a uniform passport, be examined and that the European Council, meeting in Rome on 3 and 4 December 1975, agreed on the basis of the report submitted to it to introduce a passport of uniform design,

&gt;**anxious to promote any measures which might strengthen the feeling among nationals of the Member States that they belong to the same Community**,

For devices manufactured ten years ago, yes. Over the last decade they've become increasingly rare, with USB-A ports replacing them. The last phone with a molded cable charger I've seen in person was the Samsung Galaxy S3, which came out in 2012.

&gt; There is no charger directive. And when the MoU came into effect, everyone and their mother was switching to USB anyway.

I remember the discussions from back then. Just the threat of the EU passing a directive was enough to strongly encourage the industry to move towards a standard charger because nobody wanted to release a phone right before a directive that'd force an immediate redesign. The directive was effective without even being finalized.

4201,"I do accept that these ideologies follow the socialist tradition of thought. It's your last sentence I have a problem with. Let's take the Oxford Dictionary definition of socialism:

""A political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.""

The core of this definition being the means of production owned by the community as a whole. This is not possible in capitalism, therefore socialists understand this is incompatible with capitalism. The ideologies you name are influenced by socialism, yes, but they aren't real socialism, because they exist inside the capitalist framework.

But, because I know someone will point out the ""regulated"" in the definition, I will explain why this is also not possible in capitalism. Capitalism is based on the free market, with less or more regulation. The power over the decision-making in a capitalist enterprise will always stay with the owners and managers, within the existing framework of regulation. If the means of production are fully regulated by the whole community, the power lies with the community and not the capitalists.

You may consider this a circular argument, but I don't think it is. This is because competition between two companies fully regulated by the community is nonexistant, as this is not at the advantage of the community at a whole, only the individual company. Therefore the capitalist framework of competition and free trade is not possible in a fully regulated market. 

Again, I accept that social democracy and social liberalism are influenced by socialism (as well as capitalism, even more by capitalism with social liberalism), but this doesn't mean they are socialist.",,/r/europe/comments/bigfbk/pedro_sánchez_leader_of_psoe_socialist_party_wins/em59gc4/,JoNaThaNThefIrelOrd,1556639437

4308,"In Germany only Sachsen-Anhalt and Berlin aren't blue. Sachsen-Anhalt was at 5,3%. It should be blue now. But Berlin was at 6,1%.

Oh, Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing “g” as “j” is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “wa?”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport – which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “town’s” “mayor”, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany’s tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Berlin is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs. Berlin is the Detroit of Germany and should be sold to Poland for 200 Złoty.",,/r/europe/comments/bj1s6d/unemployment_rate_2018_nuts_2/em4yppq/,nasserKoeter,1556632297

And this isn't the first time Bloombergs publishes utter trash in an attempt to help the US' witch hunt against foreign companies. From /u/OnEarth2000:


------------------------

From /u/OnEarth2000:

Come on, this is Bloomberg on China, it is pure smearing and propaganda.


From Bloomberg
[The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. Companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies)


Denied by Apple, Amazon and SuperMicro in the strongest possible term. USA's Homeland Security and other agencies doubted it.
[The tech giants, the US and the Chinese spy chips that never were](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/13/tech-giants-us-chinese-spy-chips-bloomberg-supermicro-amazon-apple)

&gt;Then the UK National Cyber Security Centre weighed in, saying that it had “no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Apple”.
The US Department of Homeland Security said much the same. And Supermicro (whose market value had been halved by the Bloomberg story) stated that it had “never been contacted by any government agencies either domestic or foreign regarding the alleged claims”.


And now, with USA's smearing and attacking on Huawei continuing on its height, Bloomberg goes along and supports these actions.

[Vodafone denies Huawei Italy security risk](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48103430)
&gt;Vodafone has denied a report saying issues found in equipment supplied to it by Huawei in Italy in 2011 and 2012 could have allowed unauthorised access to its fixed-line network there.

So, why is Bloomberg running with this hit-piece?

&gt;""The 'backdoor' that Bloomberg refers to is Telnet, which is a protocol that is commonly used by many vendors in the industry for performing diagnostic functions. It would not have been accessible from the internet.

This is the same types of ""backdoor"", ""hacks"" that USA government have been tellings EU about, but it exists for Vendors and in other telecommunication provider software too. This is one of the reason why EU won't go along with USA on Huawei.

&gt;""Bloomberg is incorrect in saying that this 'could have given Huawei unauthorised access to the carrier's fixed-line network in Italy'.


&gt;""The issues were identified by independent security testing, initiated by Vodafone as part of our routine security measures, and fixed at the time by Huawei.""
&gt;A Huawei spokesperson said: 'We were made aware of historical vulnerabilities in 2011 and 2012 and they were addressed at the time.
&gt;""In addition, we have no evidence of any unauthorised access. This was nothing more than a failure to remove a diagnostic function after development.

So, Vodafone found a possible software vulnerability, talk Huawei about it and Huawei fixed it and there was no unauthorised access.


So American Mainstream media's goal:  “a lie repeated a thousand times becomes truth.”

Development costs is irrelevant for all of those platforms for Poland as they were already paid for by others.

&gt;Also the idea that the planes will get cheaper once they exit Low rate initial production is questionable, when you consider the US DoDs track record. From Wikipedia:

As mentioned before by others the F-35A, the version which Poland would get, is 89.2M USD as of 2018, and on track to reach 80M.

&gt;Either way you dont buy F-35 to get the best plane on the market, you buy it to get in good with the US, which is really important if you are a NATO member like Poland.

Meanwhile, this caused the left to mobilise, both by reducing abstention and tactical shifts from Podemos to the Socialists, while finally the rise of Vox saw larger votes for regional parties.

&gt;The Netherlands had been a member for decades and it had barely been a discussion here, unlike in the UK. Of course this has an impact on easily available research.

There is barely a discussion yet you can also pinpoint whose is to blame for everything that ""people"" push on the EU without either having taken to them or having seen any poll? Wow, some skills you got there.

There haven't been any discussion for joining the EU here in decades either yet we still have conducted polls and studies on it. I'm also previously read research on it in Italy. 

&gt;Maybe it is there. I can't be bothered to find it for you and am confident in my claim that people wanting to leave the EU are basing that by far on reasons that are national policy or are consequences of national policy.

&gt;There is barely a discussion yet you can also pinpoint whose is to blame for everything that ""people"" push on the EU without either having taken to them or having seen any poll? Wow, some skills you got there.

Yes, there is barely a discussion, since about 85%+ of Dutch people want to stay in the EU. The people voting for FvD or PVV (the only ones wanting to leave the EU) do that for multiple reasons which are all related to national policy, yet you also see leaving the EU enter the argument (as seen with the person I was originally replying to).

 The Commission funds a programme run by the UNHCR for prepaid debit cards for refugees and asylum seekers in Greece.

**There are no anonymous debit cards. The beneficiaries of each card are known. The cards include a number that refers to the identity of the beneficiary enrolled in the programme.

4453,"&gt; Whichever way you look at it, it's a database of your viewing habits owned by a private entity - backed by the government. 

Well, it obviously *could* be.  I haven't read the bill text or paid attention to what's going on with the implementation, but it's possible to implement it in such a way so as to not leak viewing data from the filtering system.  I mean, I doubt that that's *actually* the way it works, but you can do things like doing a hash of the domain and then fetching a collection of banned URLs keyed off the prefix of the domain.  Then you cache that.  Firefox has done similar stuff in flagging domains used for malware to avoid leaking what domains people are browsing to Mozilla.  Having the system cache those collections for multiple users could help mask behavior as well.  And you don't need to actually retain or expose any information about what domains were accessed outside of that.

That's obviously still something that a dedicated attacker *could* data-mine.  Like, maybe content at Domain A references content at Domain B and Domain C, and if you get three hits for collections of blacklisted domains corresponding that are addressed by a hash prefix corresponding to each in rapid succession from a box that only is filtering for a small set of users -- then you probably expose the fact that a user is actually trying to view Domain A and not just some domain that *happens* to have the same hash prefix as Domain A.

Or if the bandwidth isn't an issue, you can just have the filters sync the entire blacklist periodically and not have them pull anything at all based on what's being accessed.

Obviously, it's a big step towards a box that *can* generate such a database, since there's no externally-visible difference to a user.

4463,"&gt;That requires a complete redesign of hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure.

No, it doesn't. Transmission lines are needed to improve the efficiency of the EU energy market no matter what. We're going to build those anyway. We already have a form of demand management in the form of night/day meters, and those will simply be upgraded to smartgrid meters, that would happen anyway. Most battery powered electronics already have a chip attached too coordinate that anyway. We also already have the gas network and infrastructure to use it, the only thing we need are power to gas plants, something we will need anyway if we are to source our heating fuel from a source that doesn't generate greenhouse gases.

&gt;It's not surprising that the most readily achievable part of the green Agenda (shutting down nuclear) would be the first to be achieved, and redesigning modern industry, transport and power transmission and storage would take a bit longer. 

The market won't move before the decision is taken. They don't want that risk. So as long as we keep hemming and hawing, we can't leverage private market investment and innovation as well.

&gt;I'm against nuclear power as well, so I support the decision, but acting as if Greens are blameless here is too easy. They made the choice to lobby for a nuclear shut down without tying it to other necessary reforms.

Politically, that just risks that everything is undone after an election.

But if it then tries to use it's size and position to then strong arm preferential treatment over other nations then quite frankly it'll go a long way in proving the idea that EU is just like any other ""super nation"" - a complete bully wrapped up in self interest.

I always love hearing europhiles talking about how great a deal it is to not have to have parts of the EU lmao

&gt;The British people constantly polled as pro-EU/UK.

Yeah, no. They were opposed to the Lisbon treaty. Which is why the Labour geniuses decided to sign it without a referendum despite promising to hold one when elected.

&gt;And since 2014? How can you say that this is us being represented? If this was at any other level of government, national or regional, then there would be outcry about the lack of representation

They represent their voters perfectly. They don’t want to be a part of the EU. They don’t want to make new EU laws. They don’t want integration. 

&gt;The anti-EU/UK sentiment has only spiked massively since UKIP got elected to the European Parliament.

They’ve been elected to the European Parliament since 1999. And they gradually grew along with euroscepticism until they came first place in 2014. They were in second place in 2009.

The issue seems to always boil down to europhiles demanding that british eurosceptics should elect people who will “contribute” and “represent” by making laws they don’t want, and signing us up for things we don’t desire.

The same way europhiles got upset and talked about how much “influence” the Conservative party lost when Cameron took their MEPs out of the EPP group. He took them out because they’re a pro integration group that demands its members vote likewise. The conservatives were supposed to be anti integration as party policy.

4533,"&gt; Halla-Aho

Lets see what I can find about the guy. 

&gt; On 27 March 2009, the Helsinki District Court ordered Halla-aho to stand for trial on charges of ethnic agitation and breach of the sanctity of religion. The charges were raised on the basis of remarks related to the sentencing of Seppo Lehto on Halla-aho's blog in 2008. Here, he wrote that the prophet Muhammad was a pedophile, making reference to Muhammad's relationship with Aisha, and that Islam is a religion that sanctifies pedophilia.

Jesus Christ, that's potentially illegal huh? Remember that case in Austria a couple months back?

&gt; In another text, he asked if it could be stated that robbing passersby and living on taxpayers' expense are cultural and possibly genetic characteristics of Somalis.[44] The text was originally intended as a response to a Finnish columnist of the newspaper Kaleva, who had written that drinking excessively and killing when drunk were cultural and possibly genetic characteristics of Finns.

Fair enough actually. He is making a point using ''racist'' thinking against the ''racists'' themselves. Is that considered bad these days?

Anyways, what he said might be illegal in Finland for some strange reasons but unlike the MP in questions, he doesn't seem to be genuinely racist. Fuck it, I even like him :)",Norway,/r/europe/comments/biq92t/new_finnish_mp_hussein_altaees_had_antisemitic/em4kpos/,NarcissisticCat,1556618221

the dc-10 was in an era with totally different safety expectations and even it did not quite have the safety stats of this one! 

If plane gets a software patch and everybody swears up and down the plane is safe, even still many passengers will not want to fly on it. Passengers will be looking at plane models now before buying a ticket. Now ryanair I am sure will put its own (when delivered) flying or charge more for non max flights (Seriously. I am totally sure they got it all prepared). But Lufthansa buying some 737macx, even if it will be a small part of their fleet and being delivered only years from now, if it shows up on the news it means many many of its future passengers are going to be checking and double checking and calling helplines to figure out what plane they will be flying in soon.

Airbus engineers designed bigger and most efficient engines to upgrade the A320neo, boeing copycat the bigger engine strategy, but their planer were too low to the ground, si the moved the engine up, because aerodinamics this new change forced the plane to go up, but if pilots needed to take a course it wouldnt be as attractive as Airbus, so they added a  sofware to counter this strange behaviour.

Probably, but when? Dad would have to get a stable source of income from what I understand, but he'd have to go legal to enter the workforce, right? The family managed to fail at that for five (seven?) years straight, so that could mean the kids growing up in a foster family all right. Besides, if they really planned to leave for the home country, is there a procedure to return kids for that?

And then there's the issue of cultures and mentality. Sure, maybe a really cold-blooded european could surrender to the law and let the law decide what to do with their kids, but in a russian's eyes, the state has acted against their family and children.

4783,"&gt; Create a scientific and technological organisation to lead changes by scientists and engineers opinion and knowledge to guide Europe and not by politicians

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy

&gt; Technocracy is a proposed system of governance in which decision-makers are selected on the basis of their expertise in a given area of responsibility, particularly with regard to scientific or technical knowledge. This system explicitly contrasts with the notion that elected representatives should be the primary decision-makers in government,[1] though it does not necessarily imply eliminating elected representatives. Leadership skills for decision-makers are selected on the basis of specialized knowledge and performance, rather than political affiliations or parliamentary skills.[2]

Today, normally you have technical specialists beneath politicians and the politicians act as specialists interfacing with the public, ensuring that those specialists work more-or-less in line with the interests of the public and selling policy to the public.

How do you aim to achieve those two goals?  And is it necessary to have technical specialists holding those top-level decisions for valid decisions to be made on technical matters?  Remember that politicians can normally obtain technical advice if they want it.

&gt; Allow scientists travel and work more easily around EU

As long as they are employed, scientists and non-scientists who are citizens of an EU member can already move around.

I guess you could expand Schengen or bring in non-EU citizens.

&gt; Allow the scientific organism advise to politicians in his politics about important decisions with knowledge about world and technologies

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliamentary_Technology_Assessment

&gt; The European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) is a network of technology assessment (TA) institutions specialising in advising parliamentary bodies in Europe.
&gt;
&gt; The EPTA partners advise parliaments on the possible social, economic and environmental impact of new sciences and technologies. The common aim is to provide impartial and high quality analysis and reports of developments in issues such as for example bioethics and biotechnology, public health, environment and energy, ICTs, and R&amp;D policy. Such work is seen as an aid to the democratic control of scientific and technological innovations, and was pioneered in the 1970s by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) of the US Congress. EPTA aims to advance the establishment of technology assessment (TA) as an integral part of policy formation in parliamentary decision-making processes in Europe, and to strengthen the links between TA units in Europe. 

How would you like to change relative to the *status quo*?

&gt; Increase budget to scientifics organisms.

Possible, but remember that the private world can also fund science.  There *are* areas that some people feel are best handled by the state.  One example is areas that require very large or long investments before any return is seen.  Nuclear fusion power generation, say.

Do you have any particular areas that you want focused on, or just science in general?  If I say ""I am going to decrease Italian pensions and increase funding to marine biology research in determining migration patterns of sea turtles"", would that meet your aims?

We are on the right track to conclude negotiations on increasing the presence of US troops in Poland successfully this year. It is also not far from the purchase of aircraft from the fifth generation F-35 aircraft from the Americans - the head of the Defense Ministry, Mariusz Błaszczak, said on Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

Błaszczak informed on Monday at TVP that Poland is currently conducting advanced ""talks and negotiations"" with the US on increasing the presence of US troops in Poland. He added that ""a few days ago in Poland there was an American working group"". A visit of the head of the Ministry of Defense in the USA is planned.

""The decision to strengthen US troops in Poland has been made, **now we are negotiating the details, we are on the right track to finish them successfully this year,**"" said Mariusz Błaszczak.

We will ask if US President Donald Trump promised 6,000 expected by Poland. soldiers, the head of the Ministry of Defense replied: ""I expect that it will not end with the promise that all that is associated with strengthening the presence of US troops in Poland will become a fact.""

&amp;#x200B;

Błaszczak also spoke about the purchase of fifth generation aircraft from the USA. ""I think it is not far from this transaction,"" he said. He assessed that ""financial and legal frameworks have already been created to make this transaction a success"".

&amp;#x200B;

In this context, he recalled the Plan of Technical Modernization of the Armed Forces for 2017-2026, amounting to PLN 185 billion. He also stressed that he appointed a plenipotentiary to purchase aircraft of the fifth generation, which was General Jacek Pszczoła, who commanded the Air Force. ""These conversations are very intense,"" Błaszczak assured.

&amp;#x200B;

""It is important to me that these planes are not ordinary fighters, these planes are command centers that increase the combat capabilities of the F-16s already possessed by the Polish Army, and will also cooperate with HIMARS rockets (...) They will cooperate with missile forces, it will create a new system, an effective system that deters possible opponents, because HIMARS rockets have a range of up to 300 kilometers ""- said Błaszczak.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; [Mother] Lisman 
There is no need for care for the children at present. If the right would 
find that the need for care exists, it can in any case be met on a voluntary basis. 
The family are asylum seekers from Russia. Right now they are in the process of arranging 
document for the children to be able to travel back to their homeland Russia. 
They will not make a renewed application for asylum in Sweden, they intend to 
return to Russia. There is the family's network, grandparents, 
cousins ​​and similar. The family has lived in Sweden illegally, which has stressed 
[Mother] Lisman. However, she does not suffer from any mental illness. During his time 
in Sweden she has simulated her mental illness. [Mother] Lisman had received 
hear that by simulating mental illness you could get a residence permit. 
She has not taken the printed medicine when she has not been taken. 
What she has stated about Dennis Lisman's behavior against her and her daughters 
was a lie. That she would be suicidal and want to harm the children is not true 
Rather, she stated this because she thought it would lead to the family 
received a residence permit. She now regrets her behavior deeply. However, she believes 
not that it affected the children in any way. The daughter NN knows the truth, that
Dennis is her dad and he has not done [Mother] Lisman badly. Her 
Suicide attempts were made on the basis that she was told that it was required to get 
residence. Dennis Lisman was there. She didn't feel it 
that she actually wanted to kill herself. [Mother] Lisman claimed she was healthy 
the times she became obsolete and placed in a psychiatric clinic 
because she then understood the seriousness of the situation and could not continue to simulate 
his illness. Regarding the day of immediate care, 8 
September 2017, then [Mother] Lisman acted on real grounds. She did not want to 
be in the family home with the children, because the youngest daughter had become food poisoned. 
She then wanted to return to the original accommodation to make sure 
that the children got food. The prevailing conditions are stable, there is an accommodation 
and there are no conflicts between the parents. [Mother] Lisman has the opportunity 
to give the children the care and love they need. Dennis Lisman 
is also a good parent who can meet the children's needs. She has 
furthermore, had contact with the social services throughout the course of the matter. [Mother] Lisman gives 
also their consent to living in an investigation home with the family about one 
such efforts are offered by the municipality. Social services are not possible 
to stop a family returning to their home country if the family is not entitled to 
staying in Sweden. 

Dennis Lisman 
There is no need for care for the children at present. If the right would 
find that the need for care exists, it can in any case be met on a voluntary basis. 
The investigation shows that Dennis Lisman is now not suspected of having been treated 
[Mother] Lisman and the kids bad. Instead, he is burdened with not being 
protected the children from [Mother] Lismans disease, simulated or not. Under it 
turbulent time when the children were taken care of, Dennis Lisman had no opportunity 
to intervene because he was elsewhere and worked. He currently has 
on the other hand, the opportunity to practically, physically and emotionally take care of their 
children. He has previously, without any problems, been able to meet the needs of his children. Only 
On one occasion he has had the opportunity to meet his children since they were taken care of. 
At that time he went to the family home with among other things 
winter clothes for the children. The social services then observed that it did not occur 
some tensions between Dennis Lisman and the kids. The kids were happy to see 
their dad. Dennis is also positive about a placement at an investigation home 
together with the whole family. He knew that [Mother] Lisman simulated 
his illness. He helped her simulate the disease by leaving 
information about her mental state for health care and for social services. 
Dennis and [Mother] Lisman had agreed, because it was 
the only way to get a residence permit. That lie was kept between Dennis 
and [Mother] Lisman as well as outwardly, but not for the children. The simulated disease 
had nothing to do with the kids.",insane russian imperialist; literally Putin,/r/europe/comments/bimw4m/denis_lisov_case_russian_man_who_fled_sweden_with/em49eet/,z651,1556601160

* They've called themselves left-wing, centrist and right-wing.

* They've pacted with PSOE (center-left) and VOX (far right).

In fact I've made complete lies about the US and Sweden in order to get fast karma. Best way to get Karma on Reddit is by American bashing. The irony is it made me realise how insanely hard people are on the US while how obviously bias they are to literally any other country except Russia. I stated clear lies and got reddit gold.. yet when I've submitted facts that were contrary to the circlejerk and not Anti-American I got the exact opposite, tons of downvotes, I'm a shill, etc etc.

I think the UK is the same as the US in that regard. No insult abroad hasn't already been said by its own people a billion times over, no actual true fact isn't already known there first yet theres the superiority hate from abroad as if everyone are sheeple.

In that there are some fields in which there is little pay ot be made or no job to find later on. But that was part of the decision process of going into that field in the first place and is known to every one. So the in these fields, the argument: 
""they study useless stuff and don´t get a job afterwards"" 
does not apply as it was part of the decision process. And they intentionally went that way anyway in order to get lucky and maybe become an actor or artist or archeologist or some shit.
BUT everyone knows that and will tell you beforehand that, when you start to study these, that they won´t find a job. So there is no crying about it later.
Also a field of study is usually an important decision in everyones live and these decisions are made with family and friends. Especially if huge loans are involved. So everyone making the adult decision to study has had most of their options laid out before them by the adults around them.

All the other business fields are able to get you a decent job quickly! You may have to move to another city but you probably already did that when starting to study.
Yes! You may not end up in the exact job you studied for but thats why the courses are ""fluent"" and teach a broad variaty and you learn things that makes you valuable for other similar jobs. Where you maybe only need the knowledge from 1 or two courses.
I also sometimes hear that ppl write 100 applications and don´t get a job. I genuinely don´t believe that or they just searched a 100 comps changed the letter head on the mail and send out 100 application which are the same(thats wrong btw).

5216,"Well, you're already considering them Slovaks, so what is the point of asking me?

Have centuries of living in Hungary made Slovaks Hungarian?

&amp;#x200B;

It is a complex issue of citizenship (legal) vs. identity (cultural) vs. ethnicity (descendance), with language (which is, I'd argue, subject to/a pillar of identity) thrown into the mix. Therefore, the answer depends on the particular circumstances of the individual (an ethnic Slovak born and living in Hungary and speaking Hungarian is quite a different case than an ethnic Hungarian born and living in Slovakia and speaking Hungarian, in my opinion).

&amp;#x200B;

You're very much in the right in that the *external views* on the issue of the identity of an individual cannot be disregarded completely. Which is all the more true - due to more emphatic differences - in the case of al-Taee, too.

&amp;#x200B;

German industry research very much relies on lab technicians carrying out the lab tasks for example. Of course they will never design the labs/come up with the procedures but they are usually much better at the practical ""mixing together chemicals"" part than trained chemists. The guys with the PhD in chemistry go on to lead the industrial r&amp;d lab while the lab technicians do the hand on tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

Same with banking etc. The guys that become bankers via vocational training will be the guys that do the ""on the ground"" services - giving you a credit, selling you stocks etc. - while the people that studied econ manage the funds and all the higher level stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Similar in media, where you can become a tv/radio host, cameraman, webdesigner, media designer, audio technician with vocational training.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole point is that ""new jobs in research and technology and entertainment"" don't always need to be filled with people with university education. Of course in many cases the higher positions need people with university education, but you can setup your economy in ways where there's loads of tasks that can be performed by people with vocational training.",,/r/europe/comments/bil76t/the_eu_has_reached_its_target_for_share_of/em2naro/,MagiMas,1556559656

5373,"&gt; Because that's what happens. That's literally how electricity grid networks are managed, both in theory and in practice.
&gt;
&gt; I'm sorry, I can't change how it works.

Sorry but you totally miss the point. Instead of delivering on demand, managing the demand is a thing. Its called demand-side-response (DSR). Peak demand management does not decrease total energy consumption, but reduces the need for investments in networks and/or power plants for meeting peak demands. Energy demand management activities attempt to bring the electricity demand and supply closer to a perceived optimum, and help give electricity end users benefits for reducing their demand. In the modern system, the integrated approach to demand-side management is becoming increasingly common. IDSM automatically sends signals to end-use systems to shed load depending on system conditions.

&gt; I can't even understand how you could remotely believe something as preposterous. I don't mean to be rude, but you don't seem to understand how a nuclear power plant actually work at all.

No miss the point. Nuclear power has to run on 100% (actually often 115% of the original design, after getting permits by the nuclear security agencies of the given country) because of the price issue. A privat company has the economic need to stay at the maximum production of a nuclear plant all the time. Nuclear energy is a money losing business, which only worked due to heavy subsidies. In the modern political climate those drop lower and lower, pressuring energy companies to run nuclear power plants on peak production as much as possible. Worldwide nuclear energy runs on an average [of  86.8%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/US_EIA_monthly_capacity_factors_2011-2013.png) capacity factor, but that includes maintaince shut downs and SCRAMs, as well as production disruption caused by politics or hot summers where the water level of the rivers is too low for the cooling installations. In short: When ever a reactor is critical, the companies want 100% capacitiy in use - to not lose money.

&gt; French nuclear power plants are constantly adapting to the demand, alongside other means of production, most notably hydro. I really don't get how and why would think it cannot be modulated.

Yes, because France still is the country next to China with throws the most money on nuclear plants to cover the losses. But in the real world nuclear power has to compete against everything else and without subsidies they are basically fucked if not running at peak all the time.

&gt; I can tell that you're strongly in favour of renewables, and very much opposed to nuclear energy - and I respect that.

No, i am OK with nuclear energy. I am not OK with nuclear energy in the hands of privat companies. Also the idea of nuclear energy as part of a solution for a CO2 neutral electricity production is laughable. Sure, France can do that. But what are ..... 90% of all countries in the world gonne do? For sure there will be no nuclear plants in Cambodia or Nigeria. They dont have the nessesary know how to operate them safely, nor do they have the nessesary stability to guarantee a save handling of a nuclear industry for decades.

And last but not least:

&gt; Again, electricity inherently cannot be stockpiled.

Yes, very technical speaking you cant. You always have to convert it to chemical or potential or kinetic energy to store it. But thats exactly what pumped-storage hydroelectricity does. It converts electricity into potential energy (pumping water up) and that potential back to electricity (running water down through a turbine) on demand.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/biam64/the_uk_now_has_the_most_offshore_wind_turbine/em2cu2u/,zehferris,1556552603

Dying in the most horrific agony was his way to point to the suffering of the citizens of BiH, who were frantically killed, persecuted and humiliated.

&gt; - Bamford’s last words were: “The British people must stop the war in Bosnia, using force if necessary. The British army must not only be a guardian of honor at mass funerals. Bosnian babies, children and women are patiently waiting for the politicians to do what they should do – provide military protection. They must not stand aside and observe”.

&gt; - Bamford had no connections with BiH and its citizens whatsoever, but the images of terror from BiH made him sacrifice. Bamford was deeply shocked with images that came from Croatia and BiH. In the testimonies of his acquaintances and psychologists, he saw his own daughter in every child-victim of the war in BiH. His condition deteriorated after the shootings of the massacre in Ahmići, on the 16th of April 1993, when 116 people were killed, including a three-month-old baby.

&gt; - For the majority of citizens in BiH, Graham Bamford is a typical British name and last name, without any special significance. Although he sacrificed himself to draw the world’s attention to the war in BiH, his name is mentioned only on April 6, during the presentation of the award named after him. The award was established by the City Administration of the City of Sarajevo in 2009.

&gt; - Croatian film director Nenad Puhovski made a documentary about his action and the silence that followed it.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/bir1xk/graham_bamford_burned_himself_in_1993_to_draw/em2dkq7/,Wwhhaattiiff,1556553096

5421,"&gt; Then again if the mother was completely nuts they might decide the children shouldn’t be with her because it would unnecessarily burden them or she might pose a threat to the children. 

This is what I gather from court testimonies described in other Polish media:


The mother was placed in a hospital so she had no contact with the children. The father was deemed unable to provide for the children as he recently lost his job. The girls were taken from the father under his absence as he was looking for work. 


No interviews or court proceedings related to the case took place.  The girls were taken from the father based on a bureaucratic decision. 

The Polish judge didn't find any issues that would cause any concern about the father's parental suitability and the girls said they didn't want to be separated from their father.


The Polish court ruled that the Swedish social service had violated an EU convention that forbids the placement of children in foreign cultural environments. The court also noted that Lisov’s paternity rights had not been revoked, which is why the children could and should stay with their father.

1. No other member state will hold any referendum on leaving, even if people really want it.

Hence the shit show and potential for no Brexit in the end. It won't be repeated.

2. The EU will push their agenda regardless of dissent from member states, like they've always done. They will always find a way and they will always negotiate with individual states to implement the changes they want, because they won't take no for an answer.

5470,"There's an interesting quirk in the Spanish electoral system that I'm hoping someone can explain to me.

PSOE got about 30% of the vote which translated to 123 seats in parliament. Then came 2nd to 4th biggest party, percentage point support and seats in parliament: 

PP, 17% (66)

CS, 16% (57)

UP, 15% (42)

Even though they were relatively equal in support, the difference in seats allocated to them is huge.

I made a calculation on the seats per percentage point:

PSOE 4,2

PP 3,9 

CS 3,6

UP 3

So clearly the bigger the party, the more seats they're allocated per supporter. How does it work and why does it work like this? What's the idea of favoring the bigger parties?

Looking for example at a possible coalition government, UP is showing up with 42 seats against the 123 of PSOE. If it had been proportional and equal they'd have had something like 51 vs 106 seats – which would make it easier for UP to leverage their position to achieve a coalition government.",Västmanland,/r/europe/comments/bikbbr/election_result_map_for_the_spanish_general/em22qo3/,rytlejon,1556545356

5484,"&gt;So what kind of action exactly would you consider worthy of the US forcibly taking out the government or straight up invading?

Hmmm. I'd say stuff like threatening Bondsteel's existance, trying to break out of that NATO sphere, possible threatening the personal interests of some powerful people from the West, like Clark or Albright, etc.

&gt;Less reliant and more established doesn't mean that they are beyond US' power though. 

True, but you can't compare them to a country literally created by the US that is on top of that not fully recognized.

&gt;No but they want to have close relations with Russia and trade more with it, support its energy projects. When Ukraine or Moldova try the same thing Russia punished them severely. Before 2014 Western allies faced no restrictions in trading with Russia while there were always restrictions on countries within Russia's grasp. So Kosovo has a lot more freedom to be cozy with Russia than Ossetia has with the West. 

But that's not that huge of an infringement though, certainly Ukraine's in 2014 towards Russia was far worse. If they got even cozier things could happen. 

&gt;By the way the Russian sanction are pretty small. They only concern a small fraction of EU-Russia trade and if Russia removed its own sanctions on agricultural products then there would be barely anything left. 

Yeah, but still, keeping them is a show that you oppose Russia in some way and that you support the US' and EU's stance.

&gt;Actually I was saying not that Turkey is bigger but that it's a more clear example of a country acting in a pro-Russian way. Turkey is big of course but Ukraine is big too. If Russia can handle invading Ukraine then the US can handle Turkey. Not sure what you mean about Turkey not being a product of NATO but Turkey is a NATO member for the record.

Turkey's much better of military wise than Ukraine is. It's also not totally lost to the US. And Russia's right there and would likely intervene like it did in Syria. And what I meant by product of NATO is obviously the fact that NATO created Kosovo. It did not create Turkey.

&gt;I don't think the US gets anything for turning against Kosovo but otherwise concede your point that they have good leverage by protecting it.

Of course they don't get anything from turning against it, but they do stand to lose if Kosovo somehow turns against them.

&gt;Seems to me that these tariffs make it harder to reconcile Kosovo and Serbia the way the West wants. The tariffs don't cause much economical damage but they are an aggressive and antagonistic thing to do. They worsen relations which worsens the prospect of a peaceful resolution. 

Relations will always be shit so that doesn't matter. While the economic loss isn't that big it's still a loss and that can be leverage.

&gt;So even if the West does do that (which would be a very violent process that's going to be extremely unpopular among Western populace) do you really think Serbia's gonna be a calm place with 1.5 million angry Kosovars inside? Who just got betrayed, attacked, murdered and put under the control of Serbia? I don't know what that Serbia would like but I'm sure it won't be in a fit state to join the EU. 

With EU support, pretty much yes. I mean, a good chunk of those 1.5m Albanians will flee if shit happens, and once Serbia joins the EU even more will leave thanks to the open borders. Sure, Kosovo would still be heated afterwords but the rest would fine. And there really is no proper criteria for how fit a country is to join the EU. If the EU geopolitical interests include that country joining it will join regardless of its issues.

&gt;But I don't think reparations are reasonable unless Serbia is also prepared to pay reparations for all the damage it has done to other formerly Yugoslav territories. As for apologies they're always nice. 

Sure, though we'd also expect reparations from them. Also, how do you handle Bosnia? Like, who gets what? The JNA/VJ didn't fight in Bosnia and FRY even sanctioned us so I don't the Bosniaks can demand reparations from Serbia. The HV did, so they can demand reparations from Croatia as well us Bosnians Serbs and Croats. But how when we'll just block any attempt at that. And the Croats would attempts at making Croatia pay. And we'd block an attempt on Serbia if they still demand it. We can demand reparations from the Bosniaks and Croats (both HB and Croatia), but that'll be blocked. Same for the Croats. 

&gt;If the EU went to war with Kosovo to put it under the control of a government that's committed crimes and murder against it, I don't think it would be the EU anymore.

The EU wouldn't fight the war, it would just keep the US of our backs. And how would that make the EU any less the EU? It would all stay the same.

&gt;At best it might be able to negotiate Kosovo to come back in exchange for some super autonomy.

Possibly, with enough pressure on them. If the EU can show them that the US can't protect them from us taking that deal could be preferable to losing a war.

&gt;This sounds quite confusing to me and I admit I don't know much about Kosovo's politics. But these Serbs were still the ones who vetoed the army despite being in a coalition with the ruling party? Well regardless of this clusterfuck, in the context of the original question of whether Kosovo's becoming more independent, a sovereign army is a big example of that even if the US approved of it.

Of course they voted against it since it's against our interests and Vučko was against it, but the fact that they're part of that government shows how much principle they have. And that army is no show of sovereignty if they needed US approval for it, in fact it's the opposite.",Rep.

5514,"Well maybe an explanation on how these events happen will shed some light on the matter.


So the first step is that someone makes what is known as a ""concern report"" to the social services (orosanmälan). This report does not make any recommendations but is to report findings and sucpisions on why a child might be in danger.


Social services will then make a thorough investigation into the matter and look into the home conditions and of course the conditions of the concern report.


The absolut last option is to use the ""Law about special conditions for the treatment of young people"" (Lag med särskilda bestämmelser om vård av unga) for a placement in foster care or similar.


This is the nuclear option and in its implementation and in the laws and instructions to social services it is recognized that regardless of home conditions seperating a child from biological parents and family is always a traumatic experience for the child involved and that the best welfare for the child should always be the leading consideration.


So it's only done really when all other options have been exhausted. 



There is also an option for doing an emergency relocation, this is only used in the case when you have a child or children that have absolutely no care, think a 3 year old who's parents have just been arrested for something and there are no other family avaliable or they are unknow. Or say both parents are killed in a car crash and no other extended family/friends can be found, basically the cops or whomever are standing there with kids they don't know what to do with. 



Social services can then do an emergency location, however this decision will be tried by a special court (förvaltningsrätten) that looks into if public officials are following the law, this court needs to hear the case within a week to see if the decision was the right one. 


In such a case happens they will of course start to look into if any other close relative or friend exist that can take care of the children and social services are then obliged to try and make sure the children are placed in a safe and steady care with said person. In the case of biological parents this is obvious, but since they are obliged to make sure the childs welfare is the top priority they are by nature slow since they don't want to throw a child from household to household.



So there, that's how these cases happen.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/bimw4m/denis_lisov_case_russian_man_who_fled_sweden_with/em23doz/,somenbjorn,1556545854

5670,"&gt;Yes, solar and wind are great, but they aren't reliable enough to provide a base line for the power grid

We don't need a stable baseload. That's putting the cart before the horse. Baseload is an outdated concept that was coined during a time when there were only two types of plants: big thermal plants like coal and nuclear that were generally the cheapest, and more flexible plants like gas and hydro that were either more expensive or limited in supply. So net managers looked for the baseload because they could supply that with their cheap plants, and then filled up the rest of the fluctuations with flexible plants. But now we have a third type, renewables with intermittent supply: just like the big thermal plants they's cheap but can't always match demand, so they too need flexible backup. But it doesn't matter whether that gas plant is used to top up the supply if the nuclear plant can't provide peak demand, or when the renewables are taking a day off when it's overcast.

&gt; There were only a couple of accidents involving nuclear reactors, and yet no one mentions the gigatons of carbon their existence prevented.

Or the renewable buildout and improvement their existence prevented.

&gt;As long as the design is sound, and scrutinized by the scientific community i firmly believe we should embrace nuclear, at least until we get our shit together, then we can phase it out.

We have gotten our shit together, and renewables can be gradually improved and replaced with the most up to date version, which will continue to be better than the last one. But we would lock ourselves into 2020 technology for three quarters of a century or more if we commit to nuclear now.

Plenty of scientists recognize that fission is a dead end.

I'd say yes, I don't want the government needing support from the separatists for everything because that's exactly what led us to this elections. But if C's doesn't concede and keeps their hard-line attitude towards Catalonia, I don't think it can work either.

&gt; And finally, if C's goes back to the center, and moves away from Vox, would you consider voting for them?

Maybe. I don't know.

But it didn't work. In 2008 Spanish general election they got 0 seats. It wasnt until 2012 when they began to grow in Catalonia and in 2005 in Spain.

5842,"**Russian Denis Lisov took his three daughters from a Muslim foster family in Sweden and fled with them to Poland.  The court in Warsaw ruled that the children should stay with their father.  Now, however, the Swedish justice system has issued a warrant for Lisov's arrest.**



Virtual Poland informed us a week ago that the Russian Denis Lisov had been arrested at the Warsaw Okęcie airport by border guards.  Representatives of Swedish social services, an Arab foster family and a Russian consul came to the place.  Thanks to the legal assistance of the Children's Rights Ombudsman Mikołaj Pawlak, the father of the children applied to the Polish authorities for refugee status at night from Tuesday to Wednesday.



After the initiation of this procedure, the Russian family could no longer be surrendered to the Swedes, and the case was taken to court.  The presiding judge assessed that, after hearing the children, she did not see any grounds for taking the girls away from her father.



Now the District Court in Oerebro (Sweden) has issued a warrant for the arrest of the Russian.  In the explanatory memorandum it was stressed that the man had exported the daughters without the consent of the relevant administrative authorities.  It was assessed that Lisov's detention was necessary ""because there is a risk that he will avoid justice, hamper proceedings and obliterate evidence or otherwise complicate the investigation"".



The case was referred to on Twitter by Bartosz Lewandowski of Ordo Iuris (one of the representatives of Lisov's family).



**Surprising testimony of Mohammed A.**

Recall that the man is a railwayman by profession.  He decided to go to work in Sweden, but while he was undergoing the procedure of legalization of his stay, the local administration deprived him of his daughters.



The cause was supposed to be their mother's disease - the woman showed symptoms of schizophrenia.  The children were immediately placed in a Muslim foster family and their father could only see them once a week.  When he applied for custody of his daughters again, the Swedish social service refused him on the grounds that he did not have a permanent job.



The father claims that the daughters ""had a hard time getting used to the rigour of the new family"".  The man's representatives emphasized that ""the girls complained about the party lifestyle of the Arab caretakers"" and had serious problems with overcoming the cultural barrier - they are from a Christian family.



Lisov decided to take the girls with him during his visit and escape with them abroad.  He did the same.  He and his daughters came to Poland by ferry from Sweden.  Then he planned to fly from Warsaw airport to Moscow.  There, due to the information issued by the Swedes about the disappearance, they were detained by the Polish services.



It is not yet clear how the Polish judiciary will react to the arrest warrant.  It can be expected, however, that the Russian will not be surrendered to the Swedes.  Attorney Lewandowski from Ordo Iuris informed about surprising testimonies of a representative of the Muslim family.  Mohammed A. was supposed to say that ""the Swedish social services ordered him to go to Warsaw"".  They paid for his flight and stay in Poland.  ""They sent me only to pick up the children.  The social services told me to go to Warsaw and take them away.
