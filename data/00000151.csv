Those Belarusian territories still had many poles living in them, and there were Poles in Soviet territories as well.

Which is the reason why the 27 members have taken a united stance, something the Brexiteers didn't think possible, nor do they seem to be able to comprehend that it's real and they have to deal with this.  
Whatever happens after October 31st, it's the Brits' decisions (or lack thereof) that determine the outcome.  
It would help if that clique of liard and dreamers around Johnson would at least realise that the EU will side with their current member Ireland rather than former member UK.

59,"I haven't seen that movie but I live in Lüneburg where he was tried in 2015 and there was some serious discussion about all this.

Basically, for me, it boiled down to the feeling that now,  with only a handful of people from that time still (barely) alive, the state tried to demonstrate a hard stance against Nazi crimes whilst they did fuck-all for the last 75 years.

So in a way he became some kind of scapegoat for 75 years of international negligence.

On the other hand there was new access to documents, especially in Poland, after the cold war ended, that were needed to correctly classify what happened in camps like Auschwitz because from a legal standpoint it is an important differentiation if that camp was used for forced labor or if it was primarily a death camp. Actually, Oskar Gröning (Said ""accountant"") did give unprecedented insight into camp organization and other details and he seemed to be sincerely sorry and rueful of the things back then. Additionally he wasn't a very high tier figure in the camp. He wasn't directly connected to the killing itself, ""just"" to the logistics before and around it. That, his endurance of the long process days, where he was talking openly and was seemingly present at all times despite his old age, was positively held for him. And in the end he died before he could start his sentence.

I can't say if that reflects in the movie as I have not seen it, neither do I have Netflix but it was very controversial.

Like I said, at the time it felt like show trial to demonstrate a state of mind that wasn't sincere the 75 Ears before as it was realized that there won't be many chances left, using a lowly hand that was old and geriatric. Sure, he had the chance to become old, other than the millions of Nazi victims.

Additionally that trial caught a lot of media attention worldwide. In a country like Germany where the slow speed of courts is basically a country wide joke, this did pull additional capacities out of day to day legal procedures. State attorneys, judges and court personnel were bound in this that could have handled other, more recent issues. That is not necessarily my opinion, technically and legally it was fully correct to have this trial as the state shouldn't let things slip for some people but emotionally it felt... out of place.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ckppe0/just_moments_ago_nearly_all_people_in_cities_all/evrwl7m/,Nemo_Barbarossa,1564720819

90,"Isn’t Istanbul just The City?

Wikipedia says

&gt;It derives from the Greek phrase ""στην Πόλη"" "" [stimˈboli], meaning ""in the city"" or ""to the city"", reinterpreted as a single word;[13][14] a similar case is Stimboli, Crete.[15] It is thus based on the common Greek usage of referring to Constantinople simply as The City (see above).

91,"Last year, over 39 billion litres of beer containing alcohol were produced in the European Union (EU). The EU’s beer production was equivalent to around 76 litres per inhabitant.
In addition, in 2018 the EU produced over 1 billion litres of beer which contained less than 0.5% alcohol or had no alcohol content at all.

**Germany, top producer**

Two-thirds of the beer containing alcohol produced in the EU came from six Member States. Germany was the top producer in 2018 with a production of 8.3 billion litres (or 21% of the EU total production). In other words, about one in every five beers containing alcohol produced in the EU originated from Germany.
Germany was followed by the United Kingdom (4.5 billion litres produced, or 12%), Poland (4.0 bn litres, or 10%), Spain (3.6 bn litres, or 9%), the Netherlands (2.4 bn litres, or 6%) and Belgium  (2.4 bn litres, or 6%).  
Compared with 2017, Italy recorded the largest increase in the production of beer containing alcohol (21%), followed by Hungary (11%) and Czechia (6%).
In contrast, the production of beer in the United Kingdom fell by 20%, in both Austria and Slovakia by 10%, and in the Netherlands by 9%.

**The Netherlands, top exporter**

The Netherlands exported 1.9 bn litres of beer containing alcohol in 2018. This made it the largest beer exporter of all EU Member States, ahead of Belgium and Germany (both 1.6 bn litres), followed by France (0.6 bn litres) and the United Kingdom (0.5 bn litres).

The United States was by far the main destination for beer exports to non-EU countries (1 billion litres of beer containing alcohol exported there in 2018, or 29% of total extra-EU exports of beer). The United States was followed by China (453 million litres, 13%), Russia (234 million litres, 7%), Canada (217 million litres, 6%), Korea (198 million litres, 6%), Switzerland (101 million litres, 3%), Australia (99 million litres, 3%) and Taiwan (91 million litres, 3%).",,/r/europe/comments/ckzofu/happy_international_beer_day/evryfq0/,Firoscos,1564722646

&gt; Anyway, as an American, 6 years in Poland, 9 years in Europe (formerly further west) I’m always willing to try new beer recommendations from Europeans, so if you have any, name them :).

Oh my goodness, where should I start? Maybe with a little bit of geography:

As far as beers go, I'm probably living in the promised land. 10 miles down the road, [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/2013_Weltenburg_04.jpg/1920px-2013_Weltenburg_04.jpg) is what I see. That's the most ancient and venerable Benedictine Abbey of Weltenburg. Don't concern yourself with the godly stuff, just bear in mind that they've been brewing beer (*Weltenburger*) since 1050 AD, and praised be the Lord never changed anything since. 

A few more miles down the exact same road (that's why it's commonly named *Via Sacra* by the locals, heh) is Kehlheim, where Schneider make their world-class *Schneide Weiße*, the cream of the crop as far as wheat beer goes. 

The Upper Palatinate is also the birthplace of [Zoigl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoigl) - which isn't a brand, but an ancient legal concept from the Holy Roman Empire, where certain communities in the region obtained the right to brew their own beer (hence the general term ""Kommunbier""). They aren't sold or marketed anywhere, as they're strictly confined to their respective towns and villages (or, to be more precise, to specific plots of land), and only people living there can legally brew it. Which they do quite frequently and with awesome skill. 

Right across the border to the east is Czechia, where the original Budvar (Budweiser) is readily available, praised be the Lord again.

And I didn't even mention the rest of the Bavarian household names, like *Augstiner* (yes, all of them), *Paulaner* or *Franziskaner*. *Löwenbräu* is somewhat controversial: Some people claim it's fine, others (like me) not so much. During my time in the army, I've had more than my fair share of it, which likely is the reason I can't stand it anymore (there's the old saying ""Löwenbräu ist unerreicht: Zwei getrunken, vier geseicht""; which roughly translates to ""drink two, piss four"").

328,"&gt; The woes of a small equipment manufacturer in southern Germany have become a symbol of the headwinds facing the German car industry, as global trade tensions, fears of a hard Brexit and the cooling of the Chinese car market take their toll.

&gt; Earlier this week, Eisenmann, which produces paint lines for car plants, said it was filing for insolvency. The company, which employs more than 3,000 people, blamed problems with a series of big projects carried out in 2018: costs had been miscalculated and milestones missed, and there had been difficulties with suppliers — resulting in a “big annual loss”.

&gt; “We had to act quickly and resolutely,” said Michael Keppel, chief restructuring officer.

&gt; The news is the latest sign of trouble in a sector that is one of the main pillars of the country’s export success, and comes amid increasing signs that Germany is facing a broader downturn.

&gt; While the economy is still largely healthy, with unemployment near record post-reunification lows, business confidence has become negative across all sectors except for construction. The Bundesbank said last week that GDP probably contracted in the second quarter, with “no sign yet of a recovery in exports and industry”.

&gt; The DIW think-tank expects the weakness to continue, forecasting that economic output will shrink by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter amid signs the industrial slowdown is spreading to the wider economy.

&gt; “Orders are deteriorating, consumers are becoming more sceptical and even the labour market, which has been robust until now, is losing momentum,” said DIW’s Claus Michelsen. “These are not good prospects for the current [third] quarter.”

&gt; The forecast coincided with further signs of a eurozone-wide slowdown. The economy of the single currency area expanded by just 0.2 per cent in the second quarter, down from 0.4 per cent for the first three months of the year, data published by Eurostat on Wednesday showed.

&gt; Germany’s industrial weakness has been particularly marked in the automotive sector, in which production declined by 12 per cent in the first half of this year. This week Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, reported a €1.6bn loss in the second quarter, partly as a result of falling sales in the US and China, while Audi sold 4.5 per cent fewer cars in the first half of the year.

&gt; The health of the car industry is critical to Germany’s economic strength. It sustains 820,000 jobs domestically, produced total revenues of €423bn in 2017 and contributes around 5 per cent to German gross domestic product. More than 77 per cent of the cars produced in Germany are exported.

&gt; But the industry is in trouble, hurt by trade tensions and the slowdown in China, its biggest market. Passenger vehicle sales there fell 4 per cent to 23m last year, and sales have continued to decline this year, dropping 14 per cent in the first half.

&gt; “The German car industry is in a really critical situation,” said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management. Carmakers are being hit not only by falling sales in their biggest markets and uncertainty about the future of trade, but by the shift to electric vehicles, which requires billions of euros in investment.

&gt; The impact of this is now reverberating far beyond Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW.

&gt; “All of them have had to reduce costs because they need the money for investment, and that is having a knock-on effect on their suppliers,” said Mr Bratzel.

&gt; Continental, Europe’s largest publicly listed auto technology supplier, cut its 2019 guidance last week as well as its forecast for production across the automotive sector. Schaeffler, a parts maker, followed suit this week, revising down its forecast for profit and revenues and saying it expects global automobile production to decline by 4 per cent in 2019. In February, it had predicted a fall of just 1 per cent.

&gt; Already, companies are making cutbacks. Schuler, which makes presses, recently announced it will be shedding 500 of 4,195 jobs in Germany, citing “changed competitive conditions and increased cost pressures”. Mahle, a parts maker, is closing a factory with 250 employees near Stuttgart which makes air management systems for combustion engines, and says it will cut 380 of the 4,300 employees at its headquarters.

&gt; Eisenmann still hopes it can survive as a going concern. It is seeking a “strategic partner” and has, it said this week, already had a number of expressions of interest. But it may not be the last car industry player to file for insolvency in the current downturn.

&gt; “The carmakers’ profit warnings, the decline in production and sales they’re experiencing — that is impacting all the suppliers, big and small alike,” said Mr Bratzel.",,/r/europe/comments/ckugwc/car_industry_woes_weigh_on_germanys_prospects/evqm2kt/,bataneyelid,1564694298

347,"So childish - putting the failure of the rebellion onto others shoulders. “We did not get what we wanted so it was your fault”.

Whatever TV propaganda says there were 2 Polish governments during the occupation, one prowestern and one prosoviet.

Both could not decide who is in charge.

Finally London based prowestern govt decided to play the card: knowing that Russians are coming to Warsaw they created a great plan how to eat a cake and have it - to use Red Army remove Germans and keep Poland independence afterwards.

So they were smart enough to launch the rebellion to demonstrate Stalin their independence BEFORE Red Army entered Warsaw (and to proclaim their own govt later) but were not enough smart to calculate German forces and own weapons.

The uprising was a joker of london polish govt to use in talks with stalin and during those talks stalin offered to get agreed with pro soviet polish govt or make united govt. Power spoils people, they did not unite for I don’t know reasons.

Now there are 2 versions of the following events. 
First is undocumented (and used by Nazis during the uprising as propaganda) that red army stopped intentionally (because hate poles and blablabla).

The second is documented and describes real situation: pressed Germans concentrated defence forces in short time whilst Russian forces were stretched due to fast attack. The attack was fought back. In memories of Russian commander is described his upset that bridges were not captured by the rebels and all the rebellion was not agreed with red army in time or plan BEFORE launching it.

Which version is correct now nobody knows.
But please, be serious, do not use only one version in your thinking or accusing anybody.

571,"&gt;Correlation is not causation. That's what I meant.

Obviously a belief does not cause harm on it's own, but the behaviors that emerge from the belief and their consequences do.

&gt;Does the concept of toxic masculinity and the narrative it promulgates explain why people adhere to traditional masculine values? Does it explain why those values exist in the first place? Does it provide an alternate masculinity for men to adhere to, an alternate culture? No.

The answer to ""why people adhere to traditional masculine values?"" does not answer the question ""should people adhere to traditional masculine values?"". The question of ""why do those values exist in the first place?""  doesn't do that either. Psychological research tells us that those who adhere to those traditional male values (emotional repression, self-reliance, etc.) generally also experience more stress and anxiety. I don't need to know why something exists to know it causes bad outcomes.

&gt;The concept is purely critical and non-constructive with respect to men. 

I agree with that. Though when it states that ""emotional repression"" is bad, it's not hard to infer what someone ought to do instead.

&gt;According to the **feminists who spread this concept around with the most fervor** culture exists in a vacuum, it's purely arbitrary, non-emergent and all explanations for social phenomena ought to end at culture. According to them culture determines behaviours (exclusively), not the other way around.

Wow, it's really cool that those feminists believe that. Really cool. Though, I don't care what *some* people believe about it.

Also, did you look at the map in the post? Why do you think Poland's ratio is over three times the one in Norway? Why would it be so large in a country with a christian fundamentalist state and a largely socially conservative population?

&gt;I don't know if you're a victim of their word salad or if you're knowingly participating in it, but, uhhh, wake up?

Do you think I'm brainwashed, because I believe that there are negative traits in men that originate from past expectations of them, which cause bad outcomes and should be eliminated?

&gt;But hey, we could take all undesirable female behaviors and label that 'toxic femininity', not just their work attitudes.

Firstly, toxic masculinity doesn't encapsulate all undesirable traits in men, but behaviors that men generally tend to exhibit which are seen as a result of historic ideas of masculinity.

The same could be done to femininity, absolutely. For example, women being much less likely to approach men if they are romantically interested in them is bad and a direct result of past gender roles.

The difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity is that one of the populations these occur in commits 88% of homicides and 75% of legal felonies. Would completely eliminating them reduce that gap to 0%? I don't know, probably not. Though it definitely would help.

&gt;In fact, if you went ahead and started caring about this difference then you would question why are we as a society undertaking greater measures that alter the system (corporate culture, material incentives, legislation, lots of nuanced studies and, you know, everything but changing femininity) so as to solve a less significant problem (""women earning a bit less"") when all we do about the more significant problem (men killing themselves) is solely focus on masculinity.

Do you realize that ""we"" in this scenario is a lot of men, right? The people in the upper echelons of society, people with the power to make those changes, are mostly men. They just don't care about the issues that other men and they themselves face. If you want to direct this argument at someone - don't direct it at me, but the people in power. Those who can implement policies to better deal with men's issues.

The changes toward reducing the wage gap were implemented because of the pressure from the people it affected. The entire concept of toxic masculinity was invented by men who wished for the betterment of other men's mental health. Yet, men today are mostly apathetic towards the issues it highlights. Any kind of talk about the dissolution of toxic masculinity is met with shouts about toxic femininity - ""what about the bad things women do!?"" - not in an effort to actually do something, but silence the discussion altogether. You're here virtue signalling ""why is there no help for men!?"" - but are you trying to help other men, or just trying to keep other people from speaking up about problems?

&gt;Yes, the term itself is logically consistent. And? Both genders engage in toxic behaviors. Seriously, ask yourself why isn't toxic femininity a thing even though it'd be just as logically consistent as a term. 

Because one seems to cause significantly more bad outcomes that the other.

&gt;That's a red herring if I ever saw one. And the good old 'no true Scotsman'. And the continuation of being an edgelord in spite of my efforts to try and explain this to you. GJ.

That's not 'no true Scotsman'. 'No true Scotsman' is based on one person saying that group X does not possess trait Y. When confronted with evidence that a member of group X does possess trait Y, they respond saying they don't 'really' belong to group X.

If you read what I wrote carefully, you might've noticed I never said that these groups you are talking about are not actually feminists. Instead of trying to snipe someone with ""lol you do fallacy"" try to understand what is being said. The civil rights movement is not invalidated by a small group of people belonging to it with terrible views of black supremacy. The movement for reparations towards indigenous people is not invalidated by a small group of indigenous people advocating murder of all European descendants.

&gt;The 'rest of my comment' did not rely on any presumption about the entire diverse range of feminist ideologies or any presumption about feminism at all.

In your previous comment.

&gt;Another somewhat related issue is that contemporary feminism doesn't seek to similarly revise femininity to the benefit of everyone; it only seeks to bend society around its own delusional ideals (not even around femininity itself, which would be much more understandable) that, ironically, facilitate toxic behaviors.

I'm now not even sure what ""contemporary feminism"" is, according to you. I presumed it encompasses all of contemporary feminists. If you instead mean academic feminism, i.e. the people writing countless papers about it - I don't care. Nobody reads those papers outside of their small in-group.

If you were part of somewhat feminist circles, you would see that some people are actually trying to course correct femininity. Most notably, stopping the putting down women for either being very sexual or not sexual at all, wanting to be stay-at-home moms, etc.

&gt;I provided an explanation as to why such a flawed concept (toxic masculinity) came to be so popular

It's flawed because... it doesn't include the history of masculinity? Because it doesn't tell men what to do instead (which is easy to infer from what is bad)? Because a criticism, which is coming from social sciences and humanities, does not include in what way these behaviors are biologically determined? Do you see hear of many chemists making economic claims?

&gt;Did I say that there is a certain toxicity within contemporary feminist culture? Yes. Did I rely on a broad presumption about feminism as a whole when making that claim? No, I relied on the examples of the concept of toxic masculinity and the stories told by intersectional apostates (can provide links if necessary).

So there is toxicity in **certain** circles of feminism. Cool. Why are you even talking about them? What do they have to do with the non-toxic parts? Do you think only the toxic circles accept the concept of 'toxic masculinity'?

&gt;And if you pardon my brief bout of edgyness, you really reacted like an NPC there with the final paragraph.

629,"Russia and Europe are in a single economic space, and we need each other for full development. Plus, Russia and Europe are culturally close enough.

Unfortunately, there is a huge number of corrupt officials in power in the Russian Federation, which somewhat complicates our relationship, but equally, in the same way, the European politicians are heavily influenced by the States, which also harms us all.

So the simplest example is: Russia has the largest amount of natural resources in the world and Europe can exchange them for some social technological solutions, and this will spur the development of our two countries. Europe will get cheap raw materials, Russia will get civilian technologies. For example, it would be very profitable at the moment to share the Sweden experience in the matter of waste disposal, or with Germany in improving the quality of our car industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the simplest example of the US intervention is the Nord Stream 2 issue.

The US is trying to convince Europe that Russian gas is a danger to its sovereignty. Which is total absurd. Therefore, they shouldn't buy it from neighboring Russia through the pipe, but rather buy it from the United States with ships. The United States extracts gas using shale technology, which is terribly expensive by itself, but in addition to delivering it to Europe, it's necessary to load gas onto ships and move it across the Atlantic. After that, unload again and deliver to the European gas storage facilities. That is, according to the most modest estimates 40% more expensive than Russian gas.

&amp;#x200B;

Europe is more profitable to work with Russia in this way. And they do. But the US  wants to take the European gas/oil market for itself, therefore, in every way they play not the most honorable game, influencing European politicians and lobbying this area aggressively. It's not beneficial to Europe. It is not beneficial to Russia. And why do we need the United States in business matters between us?

&amp;#x200B;

This is one example. Russia needs European civil technologies and its market. Europe needs cheap Russian resources. Plus, we share one continent and the issue of European security is also important for Russia, because neighbors instability economically affects the entire region and the chance that instability will spread to us. Plus, culturally, it is easier for Russia to understand Europeans, than, for example, Chinese or anyone else. Gosh, there are Poles in the EU, I can understand them even without an interpreter.

Wow, what a concrete and clearly defined concept. /s. As I said, 'any undesirable male behaviours'.

&gt;Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia

So being socially dominant is on par with misogyny and homophobia? Huh. But what exactly connects them? \*intense hand waving and woo-wooing\* *toxic masculinityyyyy..*.  


&gt;Self-reliance and emotional repression

Now that's a concrete example. It's only a correlation, but it's fairly easy to infer the dynamic of how self-repression can cause harm. Now, does the concept of toxic masculinity, or feminism more broadly, give an explanation as to why men are more prone to such behaviours so that we may strike the problem at the root? ... well? Does it? Yeah, the answer provided is \*intense hand waving and woo-wooing\* *toxic masculinityyyyy....*  


I'll be charitable for once and try to explain this in a way you'll understand, as opposed to being a sarcastic edgelord like you.

Look at the debate surrounding the pay gap. There is a whole spectrum of hypothesized causes with varying levels of supporting evidence. Some of those causes should rightfully be addressed (eg. sexist discrimination at the workplace, careerist-oriented culture that punishes motherhood), while others could only be addressed in highly dystopian and oppressive ways (eg. women often choosing work that is [less monetarily rewarding](https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/UberPayGap.pdf), for a variety of reasons - it'd be unethical to force them to work in a way they don't want to). In this debate there is nuance involved and there are multiple chains of causality explaining a given phenomenon. There is no such thing with the concept of 'toxic masculinity' - it states that men do bad things and that they should stop. It's as if we went ahead and blamed the pay gap on toxic femininity and demanded women start behaving differently until it's corrected. Such an idea is toxic itself, as it would seek to blame and punish women instead of, you know, try and **support them.** This is the problem with contemporary feminism: when it comes to womens' behaviours and shortcomings they are explained by circumstance, and the prescribed solution is to change the system (laws, cultural norms, media portrayals, language etc.). But when it comes to men's behaviours and shortcomings they are explained by... well, nothing. They are piled up on the men via 'toxic masculinity'. Do you see it?

  
The issue isn't that masculinity shouldn't be criticized or that it shouldn't be 'upgraded' to something that's better for everyone involved. It should. The issue is with how it is being done and what does the *concept* *of toxic masculinity and its usage* embody. It's thinly veiled spite.

The usual “women just try to commit suicide for attention” is a way to downplay the seriousness of their situation. It’s ironic how women are just attention seekers for having a higher suicide attemp rate (and also having higher rates of low self esteem, anxiety and depression) while the fact that men have more successful suicide attemps are suddenly proof of how oppressed men are in our society (not your words but many other people seem to have this view). 

Nonetheless women do try to commit suicide for attention more often than men because they try to commit suicide more often, and there could be other reasons as well such as the ratio of teenagers attempting suicide for each gender. That still doesn’t change that the absolute amount of suicide attempts done to actually die is higher for women due to a higher suicide attemp rate even tho the ratio of attention seeking is also higher for women.

I'm sure there are Saudi Arabians who are affected, but there wont be mountains of data as the heat hasn't been as chronically hot as before.

“Denmark opposes the creation of a ""European army"" to defend the E.U. from threats, Defense Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen said Friday.”


&gt;working together in eu internal an judicial affairs ? no thanks. since a veto in the Lissabon treaty 2009, GB can decide  which measures it implements and which not. -&gt; result: GB not taking its share of refugees....

Not actually sure what you’re referring to here at all. Are you saying the UK isn’t bound by EU courts? 

Also regarding refugees, are you forgetting this....? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Hungarian_migrant_quota_referendum 

Suggesting the UK didn’t take it’s fair share of refugees is completely wrong and misleading. 

&gt;paying the full price for EU membership ? not for GB. Thatcher ""negotiated"" in 1984 a ""reduced rate"" which is not appropriate to its economic power, like the rest of EUs countries have.

FYI if the rebate wasn’t there the UK would end up paying only ever so slightly less than Germany, which is completely unfair. 

Also, just so you know the UK isn’t the only country with an opt out:

&gt;(a) within the territory of the Union, including its airspace;

&gt;(b) on board any aircraft or any vessel under the jurisdiction of a Member State;

&gt;(c) to any person inside or outside the territory of the Union who is a national of a Member State;

&gt;(d) to any legal person, entity or body which is incorporated or constituted under the law of a Member State;

&gt;(e) to any legal person, entity or body in respect of any business done in whole or in part within the Union. Therefore, the Regulation applies in the territory of the Union. Additionally, EU citizens in third countries, as well as entities constituted in a Member State (e.g. an organisation constituted under Member State law, its subsidiary incorporated within the EU, or its branch), need to respect EU restrictive measures. The Regulation also applies to entities or bodies that are tasked with the implementation, whether directly or indirectly, of the EU budget.

795,"That is not true.

The ""nationalist"" you talk about wasn't nationalist, it was a Polish Army subordinated to legitimate Polish government. It was apolitical army as every army is. It was divided on several groups, one of them called Home Army was conducting armed resistance in occupied country, and later in the war conducted grand anti-German operation called ""Burza"". AK counted about 390 thousands.

There was actual nationalist resistance, that did not recognise Polish government and refused to subordinate to Home Army, they had their own military organisation Narodowe Siły Zbrojne/National Armed Forces. They sought to create Polish and catholic nationalist state. They counted about 75 thousands.

There was also big peasant organisation Bataliony Chłopskie/Farmers' Battalions, counted about 150 thousands soldiers, but was largely subordinated to Home Army.

And there was tiny communist organisation called Armia Ludowa. That had little or no support in the country. And was basically created and coordinated by Moscow. They counted not more than 5-6 soldiers in the whole country. 

So saying there were ""2 resistance movements"" is not true, there was more than 2, and communist resistance was irrelevant. 

Communists from early 1944 were calling for uprising and were accusing AK of lack of activity. So what you are implying is not true. Literally the day before uprising, July 30rd, located in Moscow radio of Polish communists called citizens of Warsaw to rise against Germans.

It is not true that Soviets supported group of Poles that were friendly towards them. Support for communism in Poland was minimal, support for Soviets even lower.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/ckkmcb/on_this_day_75_years_ago_warsaw_uprising_started/evou438/,iwanttosaysmth,1564657946

Yeah,that's just straight up a lie. Troops tied down in the Warsaw uprising  [\~ 50 000 Germans,some of which were collaborators (Russian,Belorussian,Ukrainian)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising#Germans) 

Troops tied down in Yugoslavia [\~ 800 000 - 1 000 000 (moderate estimates)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_in_Yugoslavia) 

[Operation Schwarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Black) alone tied down 125 000 highly experienced troops (among them a full SS division) and over 300 Luftwaffe aircraft. 

Saying that Yugoslavia was a ""southern backwater"" and that it was occupied by ""a few second-rate troops"" is clear historical revisionism. The fact of the matter is,Yugoslavs mobilized 800 000 people by 1945.,including women (active fighting women,mind you) and children and fought four Axis countries at once (Italy,German Reich,Independent State of Croatia,Bulgaria) as well as the Chetniks (collaborators).

On 1 August, the day of Uprising, the Soviet advance was halted by a direct order from the Kremlin.[125] Soon afterwards the Soviet tank units stopped receiving any oil from their depots.[125] Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and, more importantly, directly from the Polish Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk, who informed them of the Polish Home Army uprising plans:[125][126] The Red Army's halt and lack of support for the Polish resistance is seen as a calculated decision by Stalin to achieve certain post-war political objectives.[18]*

*Declassified documents from Soviet archives reveal that Stalin gave instructions to cut off the Warsaw resistance from any outside help. The urgent orders issued to the Red Army troops in Poland on 23 August 1944 stipulated that the Home Army units in Soviet-controlled areas should be prevented from reaching Warsaw and helping the Uprising, their members apprehended and disarmed.

A long term, consistent deviation from historic trends is absolutely a sign that climate is changing. When the summers become too warm for native plants to survive, it's safe to say the climate in a region is changing.

How you can argue pattern changes  local weather is not indicative of climate change is baffling. You realize that there is no 'global climate' as climates are the sum of a *region's* conditions. Annual precipitation, annual temperature ranges, annual sunlight, location in relation to large bodies of water, rH ranges - these are the descriptors of a climate. Weather is just the daily expression of what's possible in a defined climate. Rainy weather is rare in desert climates, droughts are rare in wetlands/coastal regions, ect. But when the weather has shifted to the boundaries (re: extremes) of a climate zone, then it's very logical to conclude that the climate may be changing. Only sustained change proves that it has *changed*, yes, but it's not unreasonable to predict that its *changing* by comparing seasonal weather data against historic records.",,/r/europe/comments/ck8hih/the_top_image_is_a_fictitious_weather_report/evodubx/,HanseaticHamburglar,1564644327

The lyrics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory most of the songs will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Til's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal songwriting draws heavily on Laibach who did the same thing in better years before. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realize that they're not just intelligent- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rammstein truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour their existencial catchphrase ""Du, du hast, du hast mich, Du hast mich gefragt..."" etc, which itself is a cryptic reference to The Police's epic song ""De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da"". I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Rammstein's genius unfolds itself in their loudspeakers. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rammstein tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Ever wondered why there are so many guys with an investment banking background among the upper ranks of the brexiteers? Because unlike from a perspective of protecting the British economy and people… the brexit does make perfect sense from an investment banking perspective: 

Rarely is there such a brilliant opportunity to manipulate an exchange rate and profit for it… and all fully legal as unlike insider trade or unlawful manipulation there is no law against political campaigns.

If meat standards were increased or a carbon tax applied, to reduce cheap consumption, and additives found in animals &amp; their products were pushed into other normal foods, like how bread has calcium added, that might help more whilst not removing a good addition to diets. This is probably more important for Americans to consider as they're the ones with the beef and meat problem. I would say the loss of diet, livestock species, cats and heat retaining materials is shortsighted when if you want to reduce emissions you only need to look at beef and overindulgence.

I would probably recommend choosing lower carbon travel options where possible and pushing for increased rail infrastructure along with electrification of mass transit in general alongside demanding carbon neutral electric generation.

Meat uses up to 80% of worldwide farmland and produces 60% of agriculture's gas emissions.  Don't believe you have to turn vegan in an instant, start with what you can, be it one meal a day or one full day without meat or dairy products and build your confidence upon that. 
Some great, cheap and easy recipes you can pair with vegetables are pasta and cous cous for example or falafels, which are made from chickpeas and are very tasty.

Case in point, in 1848 there were only around 3000 Mexican settlers in all of California and California was the most populous of conquered territories.

First, it isn't clear whether Catalans themselves want to leave Spain, there isn't an overwhelming majority, or majority at all, of people who want to leave Spain.

In fact, the option to remain in Spain seems to be more popular than the former nowadays. 

Second, and perhaps more important, to have a referendum regarding Catalonia's independence requires to modify one of the core articles of the constitution. That's a nightmare in itself, because it would require a political consensus that doesn't exist (most political parties don't want to modify the article, including PP, PSOE, Cs and VOX), and it would require, in case the reform is approved for a first time, the calling of new elections and a second parlamientary vote on the constitutional changes.",Galicia (Spain),/r/europe/comments/cka5e6/82_years_ago_yesterday_a_fine_for_talking_catalan/evmx5rp/,HideousTroll,1564614925

No, I cited an article that purposely tries to whitewash the fact that when it comes to women (and some men) being doused with acid by their partners and/or families, some ethnic groups are indeed far more eager than others. Just like there are ethnic disparities when it comes to raping/grooming young girls as evidenced in Rotherham (and the similar attempts to keep that buried for so long). I realize this must really outrage the PC police on r/Europe, but to the extent it means fewer girls getting groomed or doused with acid, it's a small price to pay.

You should find some other way to feel good about yourselves that doesn't involve more women getting drenched with bleach. Is that really so much to ask?

I'm not denying that it's worth noting that Afro-Caribbeans youth have taken to acid-attacks to the extent that 1% of the British population is now responsible for 38% of the attacks, but lumping what they do in with the above cases in an effort to downplay the latter doesn't work for me. Not after Rotherham. Not after similar effects to hide ""Asian"" over-participation in US terrorism by lumping it in with gang-related activity in a similar effort to dilute and downplay.

1475,"Ah there it is, knew that was coming. The ""tax haven"" bollocks, but first a few things.

Ireland's unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, no idea where you're getting that figure. Modified GNI mainly exists to account for the worldwide capital asset holdings of Irish based multinationals, nothing to do with tax sheltering, in fact, a huge amount of that figure is a single multi-billion euro aircraft leasing company. Massive revenue, tiny margin, no tax to slice from that either way. It was probably a mistake to start measuring modified GNI in the first place, since all it's done is give ammo to disingenuous pricks like you, and those companies are now paying their appropriate taxes in Ireland anyway (the Irish government is increasingly dependent on the tax payments of multinationals to the point it's becoming an actual problem).

Now, as for Apple, what in fact took place there was that Ireland allowed multinationals to pay their taxes where they were headquartered, intending that this would allow them to streamline everything back to the US. But the UK operates it's overseas zero tax island territories, and Apple instead incorporated in Jersey, abusing Ireland's tax rules in an unintended, but completely legal way. The EU commission, upset with Ireland's 12.5% tax rate, but having no legal recourse to sanction it, chose to cook up a BS competition case alleging that Ireland had given Apple special treatment. Why is this BS? Because Google and many other companies were doing the same in Bermuda, the Cayman islands, and other **BRITISH** overseas territories (noticed a pattern yet?). The case has yet to be legally evaluated in court, and will likely be overturned on appeal (on account of the very obvious BS the ruling is based on), but the commission got it's political mileage out of it, Ireland has been slandered as a tax haven for over 5 years, despite that it's the UK doing the actual sheltering in it's island territories. By the way, Ireland closed the loopholes permitting this over 5 years ago now, when is the UK planning to crack down on the island tax shelters? Lol.

As for your Wikipedia links, they're all written by the same guy, an axe grinding agenda pusher called Britishfinance, who appears to have a full time gig writing misleading articles about Ireland (more than 50,000 edits on the topic in the past year alone). Who's funding this propaganda venture? Well, I'll leave it up to you to determine that for yourself.

Now back to the original point, is Ireland's economy all smoke and mirrors and is it actually drastically wealthier than NI? Subtracting average cost of living from average wages North vs South shows a €5000 annual difference. That's more than 400 euro per month on average better off living in the republic, or a brand new iPhone X every 2 months.

1551,"i think men kind of shouted down feminism with their own version that satisfies their anxiety. that anxiety has been there forever that's not a recent anxiety that women are going to far women were hurting men when they wanted the right to vote. the men already had anxiety about feminism if they didn't, these problems wouldn't exist. i don't believe there's a form of perfect feminism that men will be happy about. its a weird thing, men are fucked up. and they're not going to work on themselves to be better unless you're the perfect feminist mother in their eyes.. is an obvious cop out. and you should know better. it's lazy. they need to do the work to address their shit. they have to want to do it. i mean are they children or not?

you say it's not as bad as fgm, you know have to clarify your position, because you're on this side, but also because it's louder than fgm. no one really talks about fgm because the discussion, if you include men is thrown into ""well circumcision and you don't respect mens issues"" and what we're doing right now. i'm telling you it wouldn't be an issue for men that they would talk about if women weren't discussing fgm. the proof of that is in how they can't bring it up with out this narrative about fgm and bad feminism. men have to dominate every space they're in, so they do it with fgm and everything it's a pathology of who they are. its the reason for womens issues. because if they didn't act like this, if men didn't do this, the world wouldn't be this way for women. i feel like when you say i'm hurting feminism and because i don't let men dominate womens issues? or like what are you saying? i think it's annoying when men dominate womens issues.

 men are annoying and stupid when they act like children and blame women for their actions and who they are as people. that's not feminism. don't mislabel me, that's how I feel about men when they're annoying shitty people. men are so fucking shitty when you can't stop yourself from being the center of everything. fgm wasn't about you, you miserable loud children. **FUCK** that's what i want to say. take responsibility learn to sit down and listen. if they were capable of that these problems wouldn't exist.

No. Seriously, are there some retarded people that believe in this fake news? Are you 12 years old or what? Do you know how the constitution works?

Some politicians in Poland have declared that their local political backing is free from LGBT **ideology** and that they don't intend to impose any LGBT-related stuff in the local schools, on the children (this has something to do with the so-called ""Warsaw LGBT card"" that Trzaskowski has signed). I'm not gonna dwell into details, but tl;dr it's about LGBT activists wanting to ""teach"" children sex education in schools and pre-schools.

1570,"I think we are talking at crossing points here. It's not true that the Prime Minister has no mandate to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement because a motion carried, with majority support, that the House would support the Prime Minister should she achieve changes to the backstop after the first defeat of the withdrawal agreement. 

But of course as you know there is now a new government. Boris Johnson is not calling upon the mandate given to Teresa May, he has simply stated that the previous agreement is dead and that future negotiations are dependent on changes to the backstop. 

Perhaps there is some confusion about the two systems and their differences, Mr. Barnier is not a head of state (technically neither is Boris but de facto he is) he can only negotiate on behalf of the Commission within the parameters of the mandate given to the Commission by the Council. Boris on the other hand needs Parlimentary approval but since he holds a majority of the seats in Parliment ro form a government it means he sets his own negotiation guidelines, Mr. Barnier cannot.

It was the exception not the rule, that under Teresa May the PM was not able to force a consensus in Parliament and speaks both to what an awful agreement it was from the UK's perspective and how weak she was as a leader.

Imagine if the majority of people in the Council belonged to the same Party as Mr. Tusk and had to follow Mr. Tusk's orders, then his position would be analogous to the PM.

&gt; If that's the intention it's not working. The EU has moved on to more important things months ago. The UK is yelling into an empty room

1598,"&gt; That still doesn't establish a scientific connection between weather and climate

I mean you'd have to make some calculations to effectively note the significance and whatnot, but yes, climate does affect weather and a significant change in your typical summer weather is a good indication that the climate is changing. You don't break new records every year and even several times a year without some climate change.

We're not talking about a hot day, or a ""wow this is one hot summer"". We're talking about having temperatures 10°C above average for extended periods of times, and such abnormalities becoming... the new normal, as in, such events now happen every year, even though they would nearly never happen before the 2000s. So yeah, right now I can't establish a scientific connection personally because I don't have the right statistical tools at hand, but the change is big enough and lasting long enough that there is absolutely no doubt in any sane person's mind that the French climate *has*, in fact, changed. The 201x summers are just not what the 197x summers were in terms of temperature.

On March 11, 1990, the Supreme Council of Lithuania declared the independence of the republic (then the Lithuanian SSR) from the USSR. Although this decision was not recognized either by the leadership of the USSR or by the overwhelming majority of Western countries, the Lithuanian authorities began to create Lithuanian border and customs posts at their borders. The customs point ""Medininkai"" was a simple trailer on the Lithuanian-Belarusian border near the village of the same name.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for border conflicts was the introduction by the Lithuanian government (in April 1991) of severe restrictions on the export of goods from the republic. Already in the first half of May 1991, several Lithuanian customs posts were burned - and the authorities of two (Salcin and Varena) districts of Lithuania adopted resolutions on the termination of customs services in their territories.

&amp;#x200B;

In the spring and summer of 1991, there was a series of attacks on posts set by the Lithuanian authorities, in which fighters from the Riga and Vilnius OMON units participated, with Nashi patches. These detachments were subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR \[1\].

&amp;#x200B;

On May 18, 1991, at around 1:00 pm, the district police inspector of the Voronovsky regional department of the interior of the BSSR, Captain Alexander Fiis, was killed near the Salzininkai ambush, arranged specifically to catch the arsonists of the posts. The next day, the captain of the Lithuanian border service Gintaras Zhagunis was shot dead from a Kalashnikov rifle, the Belarusian police detained suspects, among whom was Alexander Fiias' brother \[1\]",,/r/europe/comments/ck903b/lithuania_marks_the_28th_anniversary_of_the/evlykt3/,Es_ist_kalt_hier,1564600910

Following the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War,[5] the French government was deeply in debt.

Leading up to the Revolution, years of bad harvests worsened by deregulation of the grain industry and environmental problems also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the aristocracy and the Catholic clergy of the established church",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/ck5qsu/total_irregular_arrivals_into_the_european_union/evlddvi/,Lichbigneking,1564593336

1729,"I don't know too much about US politics and therefore don't know the reason why large parts of minorities vote the way they do, yet there is no evidence the vote is split due to tribalism and not due to one party representing the interest of a large part of said minority group better than the other. This is especially plausible if a minority is disproportionally poor compared to the general population, while one parties policies are generally better for the poor, just as an example. 


Considering the turks, I've heard people complain about them basically all my life, no matter how large their community actually is. Also, where do those numbers actually come from? 
And I wouldn't even disagree that there is a lot of xenophobia (which you call ""annoyance"") in the mainstream. But politicans have started talking about migration restrictions all the time since forever ago, yet in all those decades none on which you described has happened minority parties have not formed nor does it look like they will.

Even the recent rise of AfD did not cause anything like this, there is not even any discussion about this going on. And there were high profile crimes committed by minorities, but all this talk of societal collapse has not come to pass nor does it look like it will.

Well meaning leftists/liberals/whatever one calls them in their culture have a serious penchant for framing things in a way that doesn't make people think. Typically with leading questions like ""Do white people not commit crimes?"" as if that's the discussion. That's not a cooperative addition, that's a thought-terminating cliche. It's meant to stifle discussion or frame any attempt otherwise as bad because who could argue with it, even though you're stating it for another purpose yourself.

One has to accept that White people commit crime, but imagine generalizing in the other direction. Do white people get to go to other lands, break laws, commit crimes? Of course not. No one does. But to then suggest we've somehow created a loophole for white people to go to whatever country they want, stay for however long, and be the worst just because hypothetically someone native to the area could have performed the same action is asinine. That's not the point of any social program or anything like that. Like when people suggest that people should be able to go somewhere and pay taxes and stay - pretty sure one of the biggest problems we have are corporations from other lands doing just that, and that's people.

2023,"Every decision in life that we all make, you, me, and every intelligent person on this planet, we make only by comparing our past experiences, all gathered knowledge, and accordingly are able to predict the consequences of our behavior. Your example is not as simple as you think it is. In real life, it would have multiple variables, that depend on the exact place, person's past experiences with that exact place, knowledge of the place, etc. that would change the behavior from crossing the street, to not crossing it. 

The person who would 100% of time not cross the street on the red light, in every imaginable situation, with various stimulus that could necessitate him to cross it, be it empty village in Lithuania, or on the streets of Copenhagen, such person is not an honest or moral - he is simply a robot, specifically programed to not cross any streets on the red light. This robot lacks an intelligence and free will, he is a zombie that is doing his preprogramed tasks.  

To live in the world full of such ""honest"" people would probably be the most terrifying thing the world. It's good that we actually don't live in such world, and your simplistic view of good and bad, honest and dishonest, only exists in the realm of fantasy, and dogmatic religion.

2024,"&gt; And, if we are speaking about the original version of fascism - Italian Fascism, I seriously doubt the course of action would be anywhere close to what you describe, as I recall the racial component never was a particularly important part of their ideology.

This is actually a myth pushed by the far right to make Fascism seem more acceptable. Italian Fascism was decidedly Anti-Semitic, and Mussolini made many speech about an ""Aryan Race"" as far back as the early 1920's. They also passed specific racist legislation in 1938, these are just the examples I can remember off the top of my head. 

&gt; ""We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror.""

Might be worth it to include the full quote and the context in which it was written.

&gt; ""We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror. But the royal terrorists, the terrorists by the grace of God and the law, are in practice brutal, disdainful, and mean, in theory cowardly, secretive, and deceitful, and in both respects disreputable.""

This was written in the context of his newspaper being raided by Prussian Police, and Marx himself being expelled from the country. Its almost like it was written in anger at how he had been treated by a authoritarian monarchy. 

This second quote 

&gt; ""[The working class] must act in such a manner that the revolutionary excitement does not collapse immediately after the victory. On the contrary, they must maintain it as long as possible. Far from opposing so-called excesses, such as sacrificing to popular revenge of hated individuals or public buildings to which hateful memories are attached, such deeds must not only be tolerated, but their direction must be taken in hand, for examples' sake.""

Is actually from Marx's early work when the undemocratic oppression of the people was at it's height in the mid 1800's. He is specifically referring to ""taking down"" people who suppressed democracy in that quote. If you remember, most of europe was still monarchies, semi-feudalistic and so on and there was no way for the workers to improve their position using the systems of governance. 

Heres a quote from the late 1800's about more democratic societies:

&gt; ""We do not Deny that there are countries, such as the United States and Great Britain--if I knew your institutions better, I should perhaps add Holland--**where the workers will be able to achieve their aims by peaceful means. But this is not the case in all countries.** __ Address to the First International 1872. 

Seems like he was specifically calling for violence in situations where peaceful reform was impossible. What was that one quote by American President John F. Kennedy? 

&gt; ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.""

Something like that right, seems like Marx was just making the same argument 100 years earlier to me. Or do you think using violence against dictatorships to bring about democracy is wrong?

Selectively quoting marx and removing the context in which its written isn't a very good look for you my dude.

&gt; You are trying to illustrate it by building a strawman designed to prove whatever you are trying to prove, hence you are not convincing anyone. We don't live in ideal world, and I don't want to risk that whoever attempts to impose his totalitarian ideology on me, will do so in a one verry narrowly defined 'perfect' way that maybe won't result in millions of deathts - but only if the people go along.

I'm not trying to illustrate the practical difference between the two ideologies. I'm trying to illustrate the philosophical differences between the two. Since you haven't fundamentally challenged this point and are instead deferring to practicality - which we mostly agree on - I can take this to mean that I am right.

The philosophical underpinnings of an ideology matter. Take two scenarios where I punch someone. In one scenario I punch the person because they are a different race to me. In another scenario I punch the person because **they** punched me first.

How can you be in the academia with such simplified edgy understanding of capitalism??

&gt;Doesn't help you getting sympathy when you call everyone else uneducated teenager.

Doesn't help them becoming more educated either, I know.

&gt;Well, mostly because it's not the rich people who worked for it.

The rich people provided the means for people to work for it: the material and the wage for labour.

&gt;Can you build a factory on your own?

Build as in use physical work? That takes up the work of several people, mostly people, who should not earn very much because their jobs do not require much training or education and whose labour is relatively easily replaceable on the free market.

&gt;Are you capable of giving the society that much that it is worth a factory in exchange?

Heck yes if you have the money to build it...

&gt;exploit people of their workforce or cooperation.

How is hiring people exploiting them???

&gt;Rather it should be owned by those who work in them 

Why the actual heck??? All they have done is follow the instructions of other people for a price that is determined by the market. They should not own one bit of it. Heck, you don't seem to have any clue how anything works in the world!

&gt;Wealth should be more or less evenly distributed because the garbagemen actually contribute more than heirs.

I agree that there should be a tax on heritage, just like there should be tax on standing money, but wealth should by no means be evenly distributed for exactly those same reasons: it would not inspire people to work, nor would it not stimulate the economy. All preceding societies that have tried ignorantly equalizing wealth have had the same result: nobody cares about progress anymore and the economies have either stagnated or collapsed and the systems have been replaced by a better system: **capitalism**!",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/cjoxwo/italian_cities_and_regions_run_by_communists/evjku31/,k6lvatu,1564564481

For whatever reason this subreddit does not allow links to medium. To see what other black rappers have said about their time in sweden just remove the quoations from the word 'com' in the link.

The UN has also commented on the racism towards afro-swedes in sweden. Why do so many get thrown in jail huh? Then there are these.

https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5625101

https://www.thelocal.se/20180508/why-sweden-doesnt-keep-stats-on-ethnic-background-and-crime

    The 2005 report showed that those born abroad were 2.5 times more likely to be registered as a crime suspect than a Swedish born person with both parents born in the country

This above figure shows a similarity with other figures I posted in this thread. Here are racial stats of prisoners paired with their percentage numbers of the population residing in other developed countries.

    In USA, 12% of the population, 38% of the prison population

    In Canada, 3% of the population, 10% of the prison population

    In UK, 3% of the population, 12% of the prison population

    In Ireland, 1.38% of the population, 3.21% of the prison population

The truth of the matter is that the whole developed world shows similiar rates of putting black people in jail. Too bad Sweden does not keep racial stats on prisoners handy. I am sure they would match up quite well with the figures I quoted.

Such a shame that there doesn't seem to be a solution in sight.

A Dutch UU professor gave it a go as well and came to the conclusion if you factor in every help those migrant need and the expense that it costs, combined with their employment ratio and taxable salaries, healthcare needs, and education, you are better off without non-western immigration:

Maybe it starts paying itself back after 2-3 generations.

Can you find me a detailed calculations that points the opposite way? One that does not heap together Polish working migrants with non-western 'refugees'.

Every non-western immigrant currently is a net loss to the state of about 274000 euro's **on average**.

Do people really think someone who walks in from a country that has rampant literacy problems just does a 2 year free education that just happen to fall out of the sky, gets help for psychological issues and goes to work at some shitty low paying job is really paying himself back?

&gt; Define excessively. As asylum applicants are not allowed to work, obviously money needs to come from somewhere. And welfare in this case is the better option compared to the others, like working illegally or crime.

2271,"When you buy a car they use a scoring model (Beacon?) that gives more weight to previous auto loan trade lines. When you buy a house they use the Fair Isaac and Company (FICO) scoring model and its the only time they pull from all 3 bureaus. When you apply for a credit card they care about revolving credit e.g. How many other credit card trade lines, whats your total available credit vs how much you make, and what percentage of your total available credit have you already reached.

I pay my credit cards off completely every 2 weeks (a minimum payment is due once a month) when I’m just otherwise chilling at home on the weekends. One card gets me 4% back on Costco gasoline (already the cheapest gas), 3% back on restaurants and travel, 2% off everything else at Costco, and 1% back everywhere else.  Another card gets me 5% back from Amazon, Another Is my oldest active tradeline (credit history) so I use it to autopay my Netflx bill.

TLDR

If I got rid of all my credit cards today it would be the equivalent of a 10% pay cut.

Also protects from skimmers. Chip and PIN countries fixed this problem mostly. In some ways its worse though because it shifts liability to the card holder so if the bad guys set up a skimmer with a camera to get your pin they will clean you out and you have no recourse.  In the US if a service industry person or fake skimmer device placed over the card reader of an atm or gas pump steals your card number they can clean out your bank account or max out your credit card. But fraud protection for credit cards is much more robust and quickly and charges removed than waiting for your bank to complete their “investigation” hoping all your missing funds are reimbursed to you.

TLDR2

I never use my debit card. Unless I need cash. And then I shake the hell out of the card  reader to see if it comes off before I swipe.",,/r/europe/comments/cjoi6w/dutch_police_arrest_a_pickpocket_in_the_most/evj9rgc/,alasknfiredrgn,1564558198

thats also why france can have 100%+ debt to gdp ratio and its no problem but italy with the same is a big problem. i trust you to stem this 100kg handle because i saw you in the past do this. but this new guy over here claiming he can do it too looks  a bit skinny.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/cjt6x2/real_gdp_evolution_in_the_4_biggest_eurozone/evij79u/,MoustacheAmbassadeur,1564543560

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/2/trump-fulfills-his-promises-on-prison-reform/

President Trump is all-action on prison reform. The Democrats? All-talk. In a matter of months, the president has done more for prison reform than Democrats managed to do in decades. Democrats, and even America’s first black president, endlessly promised to right these wrongs — and endlessly failed to do so, even with Democratic control of the House and Senate. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/politics/prison-sentencing-trump.html

A rare bipartisan deal in Congress to overhaul federal sentencing laws passed after a few black ministers, leaders and lawmakers forged an alliance with President Donald Trump. 

The bill gives judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders and expands prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It also reduces the life sentence for some drug offenders with three convictions, or “three strikes,” to 25 years. Another provision would allow about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty.

Try again. 

Keeping nonviolent black offenders disproportionately in prison is not only a waste of precious resources but makes it less likely blacks can hold jobs, wealth, power and independence in the future. 

White supremacists are stupid for a lot of reasons, but them complaining about blacks being raised by single mothers using subsidized housing, welfare, and other social services while at the same time imprisoning them and keeping them from education, jobs and upward mobility has to be right up there.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cjy0er/us_presidential_envoy_for_hostage_affairs_sent_to/evirk6q/,Devil-sAdvocate,1564547868

Germany has the largest cargo air hub and it has it because cargo enters the EU.

You CAN say the Earth is flat and the moon is made of cheese but that does not make it true.

You would be just as wrong because as explained nobody has ever won the popular vote for president because we have never held a popular election for president.  Again, if you want to know how people would have voted under a different set of rules then you need to hold an election under that different set of rules and again no we have not done that.

As for why Trump is heading to another win i can only give my opinon.  In 2016, I voted against both Trump and Hillary because BOTH offended me.  However after over two years of the democrats never ending irrational orange man bad rant that is way more offensive than Trump could ever be.  

Trump has focused on results and keeping his campaign promises and doing what he can for the American citizens.  The democrats are focusing on an irrational orange man bad rant regardless of reality and what free stuff can they bribe voters with at tax payer expense and most baffling of all the democrats have decided to focus on what they can do for illegal aliens against American citizens.  That is bold move Cotton, lets see how that works out.

It is up to YOU to prove Trump is worse than a NAZi and that has not been done at all and irrational and emotional rants with no connection to facts or logic do not cut it. 

As for how Trump won a big part of that was Hillary using money to buy influence in the DNC and stealing the primary from Bernie.  It was a close race and many Bernie supporters either did not vote or switched their votes to Trump.  I think that was enough to tip it over to a Trump win.

2537,"And I have no issue with those 99% of situations. The problem is that cops are too quick to use their gun in order to ""deescalate"" a situation. Drawing a gun only escalates the situation (especially in situations where a taser would be just as effective and far less deadly), and in almost every situation where a cop kills an unarmed person because the cop was afraid, and in a situation where just about anyone else would be seriously screwed, the prosecutor will either refuse to prosecute him, or they'll put on a show prosecution, or, only if it's egregious enough, actually try him for his crimes with the hope that there isn't a ""cops are always the good guys and can do no wrong"" juror. Watch the bodycam footage of the shooting of Daniel Shaver knowing the officer that murdered him had ""you're fucked"" written on his rifle, was acquitted of all charges, got an early retirement from his precinct because he was ""traumatized"" from murdering an innocent man and the resulting trial, and now gets $30,000 a year in taxpayer money to sit on his ass. He's getting paid to do nothing because he was a cop and killed a guy. That's pretty fucked up in my opinion.

I can't stand on the street aiming my gun at someone that I felt was acting suspiciously and then shoot them when they move their hand the wrong way. I would 100% be convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, attempted murder, or murder in such a situation. A police officer doing the exact same thing has an extremely slim chance of being fired, let alone convicted of anything. In all likelihood, if the public appearance is bad enough, he'll get an early retirement and a lifelong pension. My problem isn't with police in general, it's with the culture. The blue wall is a real thing. Bad cops are protected by the good cops because the good cops are convinced the bad cops are just getting a bad rap and want someone on their side in case it ever happens to them. Police seem remarkably averse to policing themselves, and instead bend over backwards to justify why a cop that did something wrong was actually in the right and whoever suffered because of his behavior was actually the bad guy. At the very least, every police station should have a civilian review board.

2707,"&gt; Sure, but if the Irish government was convinced that a no-deal Brexit would be politically worse than changing the backstop, would/can the EU change their opinion even if they wanted to?

And if thousands of miniature meteorites struck all along the British border and caused NI and GB to drift away then the backstop wouldn't be an issue either. In order words the hypothetical isn't even worth considering as No-deal Brexit is far better than dropping the Backstop (which insures the peace process, Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, the All Ireland Economy and a host of other things including such things as the shared electricity grid in the isle of Ireland).
Plus any political fallout in Ireland from No-Deal Brexit will rightly fall on the UK.

To help put this in perspective Ireland began it's diplomatic mission to the other EU27 about Brexit as soon as the referendum was announced to take place in other words *a year before the Brexit referendum was even taken*. Ireland is much more politically savvy and prepared than the UK. Ireland has known its position and made it clear to the rest of the EU27 for ages now. 

A problem I think that many have when considering No-Deal/Crashing Out Brexit is that *this is not an end state* this is a transition to the next series of problems while the UK is also in a worse position economically and politically. So even if No-Deal/Crashing Out Brexit happens this puts the UK in a much worse position than before, all the UK has now is threatening serious harm to themselves to cause minor harm to the EU27.",,/r/europe/comments/cjbp76/boris_johnson_wont_start_brexit_talks_unless_eu/evh659a/,AtomForMic,1564521401

2765,"Oh Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin is the city that makes Germans feel ashamed on the international stage. If you compare Berlin to other European capitals like London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, every upstanding German will blush from embarrassment. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have presentable capitals with a great standard of living such as Vienna, Brussels or Zürich. Germany, however, is saddled with Berlin, the capital of losers. Berlin is – by a long margin – the German city that is home to the greatest number of assholes. German Rail, the German Parliament, Air Berlin and the Axel Springer publishing house are just a few examples for the incompetent kind of scum harbored by this city. The glory times are long gone, the city has hit rock bottom. The typical Berliner is a lazy bastard. Character traits that are considered dead give aways for laziness, coldness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder and idiocy in more civilized cultures, are a source of pride for Berliners. Another central feature of the Berliner's psyche is an extreme inferiority complex. That's why Berliners project massive feelings of hate on everyone that is in some way better than themselves. The Southern Germans – superior to the Berliner in all aspects of life – are a thorn in their side. They envy the Southerners' success and Munich is the city that is most heavily despised, because that city is everything and has everything that Berlin can only dream of. The fact that the Berliners' antisocial existence is only financed by the Munichers is irrelevant. The Berliners believe that this is their god given birth right. The Berliners wallow in their parasite-like existence and praise their supposed global city, instead of fighting the lethargy that comes about as a result of their envy and jealousy by sprucing up their community. In terms of cultural life, there is nothing noteworthy about Berlin. The era of great works is long past, so the Berliners consider something as trivial as the pronunciation of the letter “g“ with a “y” sound as a great cultural achievement. Advanced learners even know how to add a “wa?” (the German equivalent to the Canadian ""eh?”, just more trashy) at the end of each sentence. The culinary traditions of Berlin are not worth mentioning. A sausage made from mechanically reclaimed meat with ketchup and curry spice is sold as a “Currywurst” and considered a culinary stroke of genius. No sane human being would ever see a sausage slathered with ketchup as the holy grail of the art of cooking – hell, most wouldn't even consider it a proper dish. But in their magnanimity, the rest of Germany lets the Berliners hang on to their delution so as to not increase their inferiority complex any further. Berlin is an economic disaster at a scale that makes even the old socialist GDR look good. If the universities are to be believed, the economy of Berlin is based on “alternative” blogs, something something about media and gender studies. Despite its dire financial situation, Berlin indulges in prestigious projects such as the rebuilding of the downtown chateau and an airport that should be seen as an art project due to its utter lack of functionality. At the same time, Berlin is home to the headquarters of all major parties, which should all be seen as traitors to the people and haven't added this to their official names only for marketing reasons. The lord mayor of the city was for a long time the oh-so-funny WowiBear (Klaus Peter Wowereit), who doomed every even somewhat presentable aspect of the city with his “Prestige and Prosecco” style of politics. To put it in a nutshell: Berlin is the trailer park of Germany. Berlin is to Germany what Greece is for the European Union. And if Berlin had open sewage, it would be the Romania of Germany. Berlin is a mark of shame, a zit on the ass of Germany. Berlin is the guy who turns up to your party without an invitation, who doesn't even bring alcohol, and who doesn't get that he isn't welcome even if you clobber him up until he loses some teeth and push him down the stairs. Berlin is the Detroit of Germany and should be sold to Poland for 200 Złoty.",The Internationale shall be the human race,/r/europe/comments/ciejoc/european_countries_by_percentage_of_the/evh7if5/,oguzka06,1564522063

Critically, California is still only 12% of the total population, the political opinions of its people does by no means represent the political opinions of the USA at large. England, by comparison, is 84% of the total population of the UK.

It is only by the existence of the wider union that makes it possible for states like Wyoming and California to exist as equals in the same federation. If it was just those two states in the USA, it would be reasonable for California to be subdivided at the top level of government.

You could more literally apply the situation to a hypothetical European Federation. In that situation, there is zero problem with Scotland and England being considered co-equal members, because England does not dominate the EU.

I'd also highlight that most people in Scotland view England as monolithic, hell-bent on the domination of smaller nations. That obviously doesn't got down well inside England. You can even see a good example of it in someone else's comment in this thread.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not blind to the flaws of the Iranian government, they are a bunch of scumbags. But the way the US try to implement another system change (after their history of such interventions in the middle east, but also elsewhere around the globe) supporting military operations in the gulf with the Americans, a side that is at best unpredictable and at worst interested in escalation (at least when the hawks like Bolton are running the show) is politically not going to float in Germany and it would also run counter everything Germany diplomacy has been trying to achieve in the last years and months in that region. 

Honestly looking at this mess i'm really surprised that this request even came through because the diplomats in Berlin should have clearly anticipated this, unless they want to put the heat on the German government (as does the recent tweet by the US embassy in reaction to Mr. Barthels statement (  [https://twitter.com/usbotschaft/status/1156116983789838338?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1156116983789838338&amp;ref\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.faz.net%2Faktuell%2Fpolitik%2Fusa-suchen-hilfe-deutschland-lehnt-mission-am-persischen-golf-ab-16309473.html](https://twitter.com/usbotschaft/status/1156116983789838338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1156116983789838338&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.faz.net%2Faktuell%2Fpolitik%2Fusa-suchen-hilfe-deutschland-lehnt-mission-am-persischen-golf-ab-16309473.html) )

2990,"There's two sides to it. 

First of all, many people don't have it, and / or don't use it for regular purchases, because the regular debit card has always been more convenient, and credit cards come at a surcharge. Dutch banks have been quick to adapt and standardize technological advances such as paying with your PIN number and debit card, or more recently, tap to pay (with card or phone). And while a bank account is not so expensive (and used to be free), there is often a yearly fee for using a credit card. So many people, especially those that don't travel much, just don't bother.

Second of all, the shops don't like it, because they pay only maybe $0.15 per transaction for these debit transactions, but when Visa or MasterCard or similar get involved, transaction costs are much higher, as far as I can tell about $0.25 plus 1-2%.

3018,"&gt;The SNP has criticised the Tory government for its ‘deliberate’ failure to tackle poverty, after the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty reports that the UK’s social security net has been ‘badly damaged’ by the Tories’ ‘ideological’ austerity agenda.

&gt;Philip Alston’s report found that although the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy, one fifth of its population (14 million people) are living in poverty, and 1.5 million experienced destitution in 2017.

&gt;It also predicted that 40% of children will be living in poverty by 2021 – which Alston called a ‘social calamity’ and ‘economic disaster rolled into one’ – and warned that if Brexit were to happen, it is likely to have a massive detrimental impact on the most vulnerable in our society.

&gt;“A decade of Tory austerity cuts, and the deliberate dismantling of the welfare state, has resulted in growing destitution in our communities – and it is a warning that Brexit will compound the damage done, leaving the whole country even worse off.""

&gt;“Brexit has already made people poorer, and Tory plans to drag Scotland out of the EU against our will would be devastating – costing up to 100,000 Scottish jobs and leaving every person in Scotland up to £2,300 worse off a year.""

&gt;“Under Westminster’s watch, by 2021 almost one in two children will be living in poverty – that is indeed, a ‘social calamity’ and it is an absolute disgrace that the Tories want to exacerbate this by proceeding with Brexit, which we know will be bad for everyone.""

For what it’s worth, I am a hardcore brexiter, and I have a deep respect and admiration for the EU and find it a powerful force for good in the world. I also support freedom of movement and wish we could keep it, because EU migration has enriched my country and my life to such a beautiful degree.

My vote was purely down to the fact that the path the EU is on, towards ever closer union, is one that is fundamentally incompatible with the British public, and if we stayed in it would force us to either block the entire process constantly (which would increase tensions between us all) or be forced down that path which would breed resentment and hate from Brits to the wider EU.

Leaving now is the only option which avoids this long term clash. I accept entirely that leaving will have an economic impact, albeit short term. I accept that any future relationship we create will objectively be worse than the one we have now. But all of these costs are smaller than the damage staying in would have caused for the reason I listed above.

If the EU did not head down that path and instead remained the same sort of union we have now, I would have voted remain passionately. 

Likewise if there was a magical way to make the rest of my countrymen support the idea of ever closer union, I would have happily voted remain.

But we do not have magical solutions and the EU has made it abundantly clear ever closer union is an unstoppable force, so alas brexit is the only option.

This viewpoint I think you will see is not one borne of any negativity towards the EU, or any delusion about Britain’s superiority, it is merely an attempt to avoid a future clash that I think will be horrendous and damaging. It is also a viewpoint I know for a fact is shared by a very large contingent of the brexit vote.

This is why additional official controls for these two pathogens are now required in the proposed revision of the meat inspection [rules] with a view to strengthening the safety of poultry meat.”"" 
So the proposal, contrary to what the title suggests, would mean a shift from visual inspection(not that accurate) to sampling(accurate).

3051,"It's iffy unless they re-nationalize the nuclear energy sector, which they should. It definitely should not be taxpayer funded while still private investors profiting off it.

People nowadays always have this notion that it has to be private investment that drives it. But as /u/razor_data put it, there's so many things that work better when nationalized. That's what the government is for, and what their job entails.

Selling cars is for profit, but building and maintaining roads is not a private investor venture. Yet without the latter, the former is pretty useless.

You want a centralized basis for energy generation &amp; transmission. I do not see it wise to want to go against that. So far in the UK this has been fossil fuel based (and taxpayer subsidized nonetheless), but a mostly nuclear based centralized grid works just as well. Privately funded energy projects are still welcome to contribute to that, nobody is disregarding them.

3146,"&gt;From what I read, I get the impression that after Tito, Yugoslavia was pretty much destined to break apart. The point where violence was 'necessary' to suppress people and keep it together was already far too late.

Not really, it could've been saved. But things did get worse after him.

The big issue of Yugoslavia few mention is the struggle between centralization and decentralization, which has been going on since day one. It was always us Serbs favoring the former, Croats and Slovenes the latter. In the first Yugoslavia we got our way, mostly. Eventually the country was divided into duchies and eventually a Duchy of Croatia was formed in 1939, but soon after came WWII. Centralization was a source of Croat and to lesser extent Slovene discontent during that.

In the 2nd Tito decentralized it, especially with the 1974 constitution. This obviously pissed us Serbs off but people kept quiet while he was alive. Despite that there were some instances of Slovene and Croat nationalism, mainly the Croatian spring as they called it.

Then the Albanian riots in Kosovo happened in '81 and started a rise in Serb nationalism. The Kosovo issue became big as Albanians continued to mistreat Serbs there with little done against it, the most famous episode of all this I guess being a massacre in a barracks in Paraćin committed by an Albanian that saw 4 soldiers killed, only one Serb though, though the outrage was largest among Serbs. Combine that with the feeling of being cheated by Tito, in the sense that we did all the work in WWI and most of it in WWII only for him to decentralize the country so much and strip us of power, and nationalism got really big. Slobo exploited this to come to power. As a result of this nationalism started rising in Slovenia and Croatia too. 

Add in a collapsing economy, old wounds and finally, starting in 1990, outside pressure, and you know the rest.

And also don’t you notice that  those Pro Yugoslav parties were allowed to exist and flourish. And on the comment about ethnicities, the Austrians didn’t drill it in, they recognized the Bosnians who lived there as targets by Serbs and of course used this to gain their loyalty by giving them rights and heavily making attempts to uplift the region.  And as I’ve said earlier, Bosnian and Croatian units were among the most loyal and enlisted in the army. Croatia also enjoyed a great level of development and autonomy in the Empire, and the only reason it eventually joined up with the Yugoslav movement was because of the high war exhaustion that affected all of AH due to the lack of imports and the whole war on three fronts thing. And interesting thing to look at is seeing the level of development of places ruled by AH Vs the Ottomans.

And in regards to the partisan comments, I would have no sympathy for partisans unless the country invading had a precedent to actually outright kill civilians, which the Germans did due to their plans to genocide and replace Slavs with Germans.

3172,"&gt; This is why the Scottish Parliament was reinstated - ultimately the Act of Union is badly worded

The Cambridge dictionary defines ""union"" as ""the act or state of being joined together"". There's nothing in the word that implies a partnership, the details of the act and treaty make it clear that a single new country was being created. In fact, it seems to be a very modern claim by nationalists that suggests it should be some sort of partnership. 

Scotland and England ceased to be sovereign states with the acts of union and became regions of a new country, Great Britain. 

I understand you don't like that arrangement, I understand you want to end it, what I don't understand is the belief that isn't the current situation, or wasn't intended to be.

3183,"&gt;German influence? The reason it died down later in the war was because Serbia was fully occupied and due to the actions of scaring partisans early in the war, it allowed Austro-Hungarian officials to work unhindered by the threat of resistance.

Resistance was highest during the occupation and even saw a full uprising, so much for that.

&gt;Also they weren’t that unlawful in their hangings.

Most absolutely were, mainly targeting prominent Serbs in order to weaken us a whole, not too far off from the Ottomans massacrering our ""dukes"" in the early 19th century and leading to the First Serbian uprising.

He was treated like shit and that prison and that's the main reason he died of tuberculosis. Conditions there horrible.

&gt;And how would that make it a puppet state? By allowing Austrian officials to conduct the investigation only and then allowing trial of those affiliated? In the end the trials would be fair, and the Austrians would have no say in who runs Serbia.

Yes, an independent and sovereign country does not let others conduct its investigations, especially that of a state it's not on good terms with. And the fact that you think the trials would be fair shows your delusion. They'd use them to take out anyone who they perceived as a threat.

Which suggest to me that you think that just because I share slightly more genetic material with the average Lithuanian than the average resident of Calcutta giving rise to us both having more similar skin hues that somehow Lithuanian culture doesn't equally contribute to the level of cultural diversity in the UK as Indian culture does. 

To me, saying ""you seem to think Lithuania is in the Himalayas or something"" presumes that somehow I should feel more kinship with a Lithuanian than an Indian on the basis of our ethnicity, which to me is racist. 

Well it were up to me, every nation's immigration policy would balance the moral obligation that nation has to the residents of another nation based on historical harm and the quality of life in that country with the economic utility that person will bring to that nation. 

Thus the structure of US migration policy makes a lot of sense. European nations already have economic opportunity and a relatively high quality of life in their home nations, so migration to the US from Europe is only possible when the economic utility is especially high. Meanwhile, a higher number of immigrants are taken from economically deprived nations. In the European context, the legacy of colonialism should be accounted for in immigration policy. 

Why should Europeans be allowed a free pass to migrate to each other's nations when they already have opportunities in developed nations, while non-Europeans should only be allowed to migrate if they can prove economic utility to the country. 

It makes far more moral sense that people from poor and authoritarian countries who will have larger life improvement from coming to Europe should have the advantage, while people from rich nations should have to prove they are not surplus to requirement.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/cjkkw2/most_common_origin_of_foreignborn_population/evet3lv/,kingofeggsandwiches,1564478037

I'll forgive the Eurosnob-ery if you'll forgive my little linguistic rant: Don't be too quick to turn your nose up at the variety of languages you have in Europe. Language contains culture, and all too quickly you'll lose both if you're not careful to conserve either (I don't mean that in a nationalist way, but a historian/folklorist way). 

In fact, the US has many more than 2 languages, but many are under threat of being lost. These include the ones brought from Europe, Asia, and Africa by colonists and slaves, languages developed here post-colonialism such as ASL and creoles, and importantly the hundreds of native languages that the indigenous people speak or spoke prior to European settlement.

We have lost a treasure trove of unique culture, including the history and stories of many of native tribes who had their language taken from them.

3320,"Credit to u/cuttlefishcrossbow for this post in another sub 

""That's a fair point!

I wanted to see if u/Glabaga's claim was actually true, so I checked out the first article I found on r/collapse a minute ago. The post title was simply ""1.5 years.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48964736

As I see it, this is misleading in several ways:

1. The post does not say what will happen in 1.5 years. As such, it leaves people free to imagine whatever doom they most fear. It's like walking up to someone on the street, staring into their eyes, saying ""*soon,*"" and walking away.

2. Now onto the article. It begins with one of my personal pet peeves in climate reporting: an uncaptioned, illegibly sourced photograph of cracked, sunbaked soil. In widely circulating media, these almost never have anything to do with the actual article.

3. The first sentence. ""Do you remember the good old days when we had 12 years to save the planet?"" At this point, you might be expecting that the IPCC has revised their timetable somehow. They haven't. BBC took a collection of quotes from ""observers"" about the importance of a series of UN summits over the next 18 months, and opened the article by spinning it as a ticking time bomb.

4. The ""observers"" themselves. Some of them are scientists, but others are politicians, including Prince Charles. To his credit, Charles has become a very important voice in this movement, and honestly, to me, a model of how royalty should use their platform in the 21st century. But he isn't a climatologist. He isn't redefining the IPCC report's timeline, as the opening of the article suggested, nor is he claiming to. He, and almost everyone else quoted, are actually talking about a *political* timeline. This fundamental truth could hardly have been buried any deeper.

5. The end of the article. After rattling off a long list of what should be evidence that the international community is finally getting their shit together -- a new biodiversity plan, a new global oceans treaty, special climate summits, a nation with net-zero 2050 legislation bidding to host COP26 -- and decides to end it with a cynical dismissal of all of that. ""The challenges are huge, the political involvement patchy. So don't hold your breath!"" It's an attitude tailor-made for r/collapse to lap up: ""I believe everything will turn out terribly, but I don't have much evidence except for my own cynicism.""

6. [The comments on the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ch4tjn/15_years/) In order, we have ""but what about feedback loops,"" ""we're already fucked,"" ""we were fucked 50 years ago,"" ""we're fucked,"" ""we're fucked,"" ""we're fucked + topical TV reference,"" and ""the UN is a conspiracy."" It's not just the way news is presented on that sub, it's the prevailing fatalist attitude that leads not one of the top commenters to raise the points I just did, but to instead, for lack of a better word, circlejerk each other about how much more woke they are than all the sheeple who still think the world can be saved.

Of all those points, only the one about feedback loops merits discussion. But instead of naming which feedback loops they're talking about, the top commenter has decided to make vague gestures toward the idea that he knows better than the IPCC, with healthy undertones of, you guessed it, ""the UN is a conspiracy.""

Now, are these summits important? Of course they are, extremely. At a time when more and more people are waking up to the magnitude of changes that need to be made in order to ensure a stable planet, the UN has a choice to be either a leader or an obstacle. But ""important decisions have to be made over the next 18 months"" is hardly the same as ""in 1.6 years, it's time to start stabbing your neighbors for their bathwater,"" which is clearly the way the r/collapse commenters have decided to take it.

So that's why we dismiss so much of that sub as ""alarmist."" Not because there aren't significant climate challenges we need to make progress on now. But because every word of content is bent toward, not substantive discussion, nor good advice, nor emotional support, but toward racing to be the first one on every article to post some witty GIF about how fucked we are.

It still won't work. 


&gt; Yes, we did. We will be an independent country again.

I assume you had to mention that to reassure yourself that you are there hero in this story.


&gt; And we will, by monitoring smuggling and keeping it to a minimum. 

How? How you do want to make sure that composition of goods and people in the vehicles did not change between the location of their registration and the border? Leave a harbor in Ireland, than add a ton of goods or just a bunch of people that are not registered anywhere. How do you catch that movement? Do you want to stop every vehicle that crosses the border and check for illegal goods and people?

That requires border infrastructure you know. In fact max-fac requires border infrastructure too, not just because of all the movement that is not covered by technology. And if Ireland doesn't play along and doesn't implement infrastructure to tags and register all cross-border movement on their side of the border, then nothing that approaches the UK border will be equipped to interact with the smart border. 


&gt; We will be. The main benefit is that we will no longer have to accept an unlimited number of migrants colonising the UK.

Apparently Boris Johnson has other plans. And once the goods are people are in the country, you will have to deal with them. The problem is not to stop them from entering but to get rid of them again once they have entered the country.

Trump had the integrity to speak up for Sweden when your ex PM or current PM or anyone in your government or your media or police or royal family was willing to speak up for Sweden and very few to include this ex PM are willing to today.

Then I don't understand your point.  Typically when someone complains about FPTP, they *contrast* it to a system where where the candidate with the most votes overall wins.

In the US, states normally allocate their Presidental electoral votes at a state level.  Whoever wins the state gets the electoral college votes that the state possesses.  The *state* is FPTP, winner-take-all.

That is true for the UK at the level of an electoral district.

But that is not the case in the United Kingdom (and certainly not for the referendum vote).  None of NI, England, Scotland or Wales functions as a unified bloc the way US states do in Presidential elections.  Even for British general elections, a government can be formed by winning electoral districts in parts of England and parts of Wales and parts of Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland.

&gt;If ministers want affordable and clean energy, the fastest, safest and cheapest way to do that is to boost renewables like wind and solar

is hoisted from the inside of the article and quotes Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace.

The article is interesting indeed, and besides the case of atomic energy in Britain, offers some insight of the financial aspects of mitigating climate change, or more generally of funding long-term public infrastructre when governments are not at liberty to invest.

How, when and why governments, in Britain and almost everywhere else, have lost this ability would make for a rather deep and thick investigation. How we could overcome climate change without regaining this ability should also be explored.

Now, yes, every public service project has to please private, for-profit investors. This is not specific to nuclear, not even to the energy sector. The same goes for transportation, social housing and partly for health and education. Even law enforcement is not exempt.

Now of course, if I was a private investor seeking a quick ROI, or a mechant of coal, I would much rather invest in solar than in nuclear, and would be happy to subcontract my public relations to Greenpeace and OP.

Finaly, the big mistake here, imho, would be to go on considering electricity as a banal industrial commodity. No other product is under such a stringent obligation to be delivered just-in-time. Demand and supply must exactly balance at all times, on pains of blackouts. The usual playbook of market competition is helpless here.

Anyway, as there is currently no plan to renationalise electricity, it seems safe to bet that every future discussion on this topic is going muddied by private interests.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/cizgt5/uks_funding_model_for_nuclear_power_financing/evd17p2/,Neker,1564427843

4089,"A few minutes’ walk from Red Square in Moscow stands a Soviet-era high security building housing Russia’s Federal Tax Service. But inside, there is nothing Soviet about the technology on display.

Standing in front of a huge video wall, Mikhail Mishustin, head of the tax service, prepares to show off its capabilities. “Where did you stay last night?” he asks. When I reply, his staff zoom in on a map to Hotel Budapest on the screen. “Did you have a coffee?” His staff then click on the food and drink receipts in the hotel from the previous evening. “Look, it sold three cappuccinos, one espresso and a latte. One of those was yours,” Mr Mishustin declares triumphantly. He was right.

This is the future of tax administration — digital, real-time and with no tax returns. The authorities receive the receipts of every transaction in Russia, from St Petersburg to Vladivostok, within 90 seconds. The information has exposed errors, evasion and fraud in the collection of its consumption tax, VAT, which has allowed the government to raise revenues more quickly than general Russian economic performance.
Mikhail Mishustin, head of the Russian tax service, chose to seek to improve revenues by adopting and refining the most cutting-edge systems around the world

The new system is directed more at shopkeepers than oligarchs. Russia still scores poorly on international league tables of corruption, being ranked only 138 out of 180 on the Transparency International corruption perceptions index, with concerns including cronyism, a lack of independent media and a biased judiciary. But reducing tax evasion among ordinary Russians and highlighting corrupt tax officials have helped raise revenues and clean up the system.

It is just this sort of technology, says Pascal Saint-Amans, that promises to be a “game changer”. Mr Saint-Amans is the director of the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at the OECD in Paris, he believes a lot of work is still needed to ensure digital information gathered by tax authorities remains secure and is not used to become “Big Brother and an oppressive state”.

But there are, he says, huge advantages for tax authorities collecting online information to ensure money owed is actually paid. “We’re talking hundreds of billions worldwide,” he adds. Being able to track information “has always been the taxman’s dream”.

This optimism stands in stark contrast with the usual gloom that surrounds the collection of revenue needed to fund public services. At a time of ageing populations and growing demand for healthcare, pensions and social care, there are regular fears about the ease with which footloose tech giants have been able to shift profits around the world to avoid corporate taxes.

But in the world of tax administration there is more hope. Chris Sanger, who leads global tax consulting at EY, says: “The benefits of technology for tax authorities in indirect taxes [such as VAT] may well outweigh the problems it brings in the direct tax system [such as corporate taxes]”.

With an overdependence on oil and gas revenues and serious concerns over evasion and corrupt officials, Russia’s tax system was ripe for reform. Handpicked by President Vladimir Putin to run the Federal Tax Service, Mr Mishustin was a technology specialist by background, not a policy expert, and chose to seek to improve revenues by adopting and refining the most cutting-edge systems around the world.

Normally economists and policymakers learn to do technology. Mr Mishustin says, “We built the technology and are now becoming economists.”

VAT was his first target. This tax has taken the world by storm since France introduced it in the 1950s. It is now levied in more than 165 countries accounting for more than 20 per cent of annual global tax revenue and raising more than $3tn in advanced economies alone. VAT’s two principal advantages are in the amount of revenue it can raise for governments and its perceived robustness to fraud compared with sales taxes such as those still levied in the US.

As it is collected along the supply chain, with companies able to claim a refund of tax they have paid on their inputs and charging it on their sales, it has an inbuilt self-enforcing element. All sides want proper documentation of their sales and purchases in case they are subject to a tax audit. In reality these happen rarely.

But there are two areas where VAT has been subject to significant fraud in most countries. First, where some traders do not pay the tax they owe on their sales and then go missing, so the authorities lose the tax owed. Second, where retail customers collude with sellers to buy goods and services (generally services) without seeking a receipt and VAT is not charged at all to the final consumer.

The VAT tax gap between revenue due and revenue collected was about 20 per cent in Russia before its reforms, according to Mr Mishustin, and in a mature economy such as the UK, HM Revenue &amp; Customs estimated it at 9.1 per cent in 2017-18.
Uber drivers are among those members of the gig economy being encouraged by the Russian authorities to automate their tax returns

To address the leakage, Russia built two huge data centres and legislated so that companies had to submit every invoice between businesses. It also mandated every retailer to buy new cash registers that were linked securely and directly to the data centres.

In real time it can now check every invoice to ensure VAT refunds it pays are linked to invoices where companies have remitted the same money to the authorities. Then using artificial intelligence, it can quickly find patterns in the data and companies which have many broken links, allowing the authorities to target certain companies for a tax audit. Since everything is linked, it can also spot tax officials with a low collection rate from the companies for which they are responsible.

The 20 per cent VAT gap has now fallen to 1 per cent and, as collection has become more efficient, receipts have soared. Between 2014 and 2018, the money collected from VAT rose 64 per cent, compared with a 21 per cent increase in nominal household consumption over the same period.

A few clicks after looking at my hotel coffee, the Russian system can show the sales and prices of all coffees sold across the country, or any other good or service. The system uses AI not just to identify retailers or restaurants that might be selling less than expected by using cash transactions off the books, but also reads receipts to give nationwide statistics.

“How do you measure inflation in the UK?” the tax commissioner booms. After hearing an explanation of how an army of people with clipboards fan out once a month across the UK checking prices for goods and services, he cries: “Bullshit! That’s bullshit. We can see everything bought everywhere,” says Mr Mishustin, who is showing the system for the first time to an international media organisation.

The Russian authorities are seeking to extend technology-led tax collection into the informal economy, where low-income self-employed people — for instance childminders or workers in the gig economy — earn small sums that have rarely been scrutinised, even though these payments are subject to income tax. Those that sign up to a new smartphone app pay 4 per cent of turnover, deducted automatically from their bank account, on services.

Take-up so far this year has exceeded expectations since compliance guarantees the authorities will not chase people further for unpaid tax.

“Most people want to be clean,” says Mr Mishustin, who has now done deals with companies such as Uber and Airbnb to deduct payments directly via the app. “We want to be inserted into the national ecosystem of taxpayers and then not bother them further.”

While Russia is at the cutting edge with its tax administration system, it is not the only country seeking to use real-time data to clamp down on fraud and tax evasion. Many others now link cash registers to their tax systems, especially where evasion was rife in the past.

Portugal, an early adopter, added an extra incentive for shoppers to pay VAT and ensure retailers did the same. If consumers add their personal tax number to an electronic receipt, the number is added into a monthly lottery for a substantial prize, such as a new car.

According to Rita de la Feria, professor of tax law at Leeds university, consumers in areas that have seen high VAT evasion, for example restaurants, can get a 15 per cent deduction on the VAT paid from their annual income tax assessment. “It has changed the mentality and the way society views informality,” she says. “Now in Portugal, retailers routinely ask you if you want to add your tax number on to any bill”.

In many Nordic countries, Mr Sanger says, the authorities have sufficient verified data that they can hand out pre-filled tax returns and ask individuals to simply approve them. Instead of outrage at the Big Brother state, “the challenge is getting people to bother to check”.

The examples do not, however, resolve significant concerns over data protection and privacy. In Portugal, unlike in Russia, if people add their personal tax number to receipts, the state can see everything an individual earns and everything spent. “The tax authorities have information about literally everything you’ve done,” says Prof de la Feria, although she adds that initial public concern has been quelled by a lack of leaks and a view that it is now just part of tax compliance.",Minas Morgul,/r/europe/comments/cjg59l/russias_role_in_producing_the_taxman_of_the/evd30pp/,zurfer75,1564428990

4092,"This is the area where the OECD is seeking to draw up core standards so that, at least in complying countries, the data remains secure and is not misused. Even so, Mr Saint-Amans says that the evidence does not suggest the public are too worried about privacy. “Remember, people have given up data for free to Google, Amazon and other big tech companies,” he adds.

In some jurisdictions — especially those which have not suffered the sort of revenue crisis that might have forced rapid change — there are concerns over whether the public will accept that such intrusive new state technology is needed when the tax systems already work reasonably well.

Edward Troup, the head of the UK’s HMRC until 2018, says that in countries such as the UK it could prove difficult to implement a blanket-style system that makes little or no allowance for more complex cases. “Mature democracies find it more difficult to ride roughshod over exceptions than Russia or China might — both from an unwillingness to apply heavy-handed enforcement and from a social expectation of humane treatment of difficult cases,” he says.

He still sees technology as a long-term answer to more efficient tax collection. Referring to the UK’s “making tax digital” programme that requires only that companies submit their VAT returns electronically, he says that once in place, it could be integrated with well-managed corporate cash register and sales systems to feed data directly to HMRC.

“I strongly believe that this is the answer,” he adds, “but would want to avoid a botched launch which sets back progress by decades.”

If these problems are resolved and many countries move into digital and automatic tax administration and collection, Prof de la Feria says the next step would be to improve the efficiency of tax systems in ways currently thought impossible. Most countries have horribly inefficient VAT systems, for instance, because they have lots of exemptions and zero rates for items such as food or children’s clothes which are justified because they help poorer families.

This is very inefficient redistribution, she argues, since “we don’t tax a bunch of people who could pay VAT on these items and know the vast majority of consumption of food, for example, is done by high income customers”.

Once people’s individual tax numbers are matched automatically with receipts, she envisages a system where poor families would automatically be given a VAT rebate through social security and “this way you get a targeted protection for low income households”.

Automated and individualised tax payments according to household income are still in the realms of science fiction. Yet the need to raise more revenue without increasing tax rates is an acute problem faced by many economies and it will only grow as pressure on public budgets intensifies in ageing societies. Even if a tax authority does not yet see where its citizens are spending all of their money today, the technology already exists, and is spreading rapidly around the world.",Minas Morgul,/r/europe/comments/cjg59l/russias_role_in_producing_the_taxman_of_the/evd31a3/,zurfer75,1564429000

Glad you asked.

Baniyas Refinery was added to Annex II by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 793/2014 on 22 July 2014. A cargo of oil is an economic resource, therefore providing it to Baniyas Refinery is in breach of sanctions


Some definitions from the sanctions regulation:

&gt;* economic resources‧ means assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, which are not funds, but which may be used to obtain funds, goods or services;


&gt;* ‧freezing of economic resources‧ means preventing their use to obtain funds, goods or services in any way, including, but not limited to, by selling, hiring or mortgaging them;


And:

&gt;No funds or economic resources shall be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of the natural or legal persons, entities or bodies listed in Annex II and IIa.

&gt;Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar can now confirm, after having received the results of comprehensive laboratory testing, that the Very Large Crude Carrier, the Grace 1, which was detained in the early hours of Thursday morning, is loaded to capacity with crude oil. 

&gt;The results of these tests conclusively prove and confirm the information disseminated last week by the Gibraltar Government and contradict the statements of some commentators from outside the jurisdiction who had speculated that the cargo on the vessel was not crude.

&gt;**The Grace 1 was detained last week in Gibraltar when it freely navigated into British Gibraltar Territorial Waters to a point two miles off the Eastside of Gibraltar, having previously exited the international waters of the Straits of Gibraltar, on a pre-arranged call for provisions and spare parts.** 

&gt;The Grace 1's position well inside BGTW when boarded can clearly be seen on the attached screenshot.  The ship remains detained in that area.

&gt;The detention of the vessel relates to the suspected destination of the cargo, **the Banyas refinery in Syria, which is owned by a company, the Banyas Oil Refinery Company.  This company is the subject of European Union sanctions under EU Regulation 36/2012, which is directly applicable in Gibraltar.**

&gt;The investigations of the Royal Gibraltar Police continue and the vessel remains detained under an Order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Gibraltar.",,/r/europe/comments/cj9cgj/britain_rejects_idea_of_tanker_swap_with_iran/evcqybb/,throwaway33282191489,1564421316

4227,"&gt;Absolutely not.. Unless there's an actuall proof of imminent danger, an invitation or warrant to enter a private property there's no ""declaring this"".. So we think the police are incompetent and would like to allow that incompetent police to ""declarare it imminent danger""? Why would we want that? No, thank you; 


There's a difference between how something is regarded by law and how a situation can be handled impromptu. 

The police can *literally* decide whether to regard something as an imminent danger and proceed accordingly. If you're on the receiving end of this, however unjust that decision may be or seem, you're not in a position to overrule this decision. Instead, your choice is between complying and opposing, the latter possibly leading to you getting arrested or whatever they need to do to enforce their authority.

If you think the police wronged you and abused their power in such a situation then you can drag them to court to rectify things. But this happens *afterwards*. 


-

Also keep in mind that even if they wanted to avoid possible legal consequences for falsely claiming imminent danger, *they still could have narrowed down the number of suspicious places* by only entering places where the inhabitants actually allow them to do so. That alone would be useful because once they receive the search warrants they would only need to enter the places that didn't allow them in without a warrant.




-


&gt;However, I'm with you that they clearly mistreated the case from the moment her parents went to them and the 112 call should have been a gift from heaven which did provide a search area of around 100 houses or so; Clearly the amount of resources for cases like these are not sufficient and, further more, it looks the police has no idea how they should be handled; The whole police system must be changed, we should all agree on this;


Certainly. I'd expect a somewhat modern police force to have both standard produres in place for such cases as well as some structures to call in plenty of reinforcements from adjacent regions. The local police station might not have the necessary manpower but usually there should at least be a few cities somewhat close as well as the next large city within 100-200km. Calling in reinforcements should take a few hours at most.



&gt;Because they are.. Since this was a far fetch search where they had nothing but a possible theory the warrant had to be legally done; Imagine if they hadn't waited and he'd now be able to get away because of a tehnicallity (anything gathered in an illegal operation would be nullified);

That's not how exigent circumstances work. A court wouldn't drop a kidnapping sentence because the police rescued the kidnapped person by entering the assumed hideout *without a warrant*. That's nonsense.

The police might get legal repercussions afterwards if they claimed exigent circumstances based on an inadequate rationale though.",,/r/europe/comments/ciryom/thousands_protest_in_romania_after_police_take_19/evcel4h/,Nononogrammstoday,1564413403

You conveniently left out parts of the text, most notably about lawyer access.

Here is translation for English readers so they don't have to read your completely unbiased summary of the law.

    The administration of pre-trial detention facilities shall ensure that judges, prosecutors, investigators, persons conducting initial inquiries, as well as lawyers and other persons involved in investigative or judicial activities, are able to visit pre-trial detention facilities without hindrance during working hours and that suspects or accused persons are brought to the facility on call from authorized persons.

Each political parties appoints justices that are either liberal or conservative, and honestly when it comes to something like the Supreme Court, one could argue there is more danger in appointed more liberal justices that see the constitution as a living document that can be interpreted very broadly beyond the original intent of the legislators.  That is how you expand government power and blur the lines between the legislative and judicial branch.  People are just more comfortable with the idea of liberal justices doing it because they think it will benefit causes they support, but it becomes problematic when you flip the tables and propose what might happen if justices were expanding government power for things like spying.  A strict reading of the laws is less of a danger than a very loose, broad interpretation.

4307,"&gt;Sure, but as bad as we were the US who attacked us was worse, even then.

No, the US was right in attacking your criminal state.

&gt;You say you're only with thugs if you're a thug. Estonia is buds with the US, a thug, hence by your logic you're also thugs.

The US is a democracy, Russia is a criminal dictatorship.

&gt;But again, I find the amount of comments left by your people whenever Russia is brought up amusing.

You are amused by people criticizing criminals?

&gt;Again, you don't see anywhere near as many of ours when it's about the US.

Because there is no legitimate reason to say similar things about the US.

&gt;It's almost obsessive. No offense.

Offense taken.

&gt;Oh, of course, anyone against us is criminal. 

No, the countries the US has been against are criminals.

&gt;Demonizing the enemy, always works.

They demonize themselves through their actions.

&gt;But you see, if all the countries the US attacked are criminal, so is it.

Pretty much.

&gt;Oh, please, how many excuses will you make for them?

As many as are logical with geopolitics and realism in mind. It may be too much for you to understand, I know.

&gt;I mean, I support Russia in this grand geopolitical game

This is fundamentally sick.

&gt;just as you support the US

Except my views aren't sick as I am not supporting a hostile criminal dictatorship.

&gt;but I won't make up bullshit excuses

Education is not a bullshit excuse.

&gt;for their ill deeds the way you do. What good does, say, backing Saudi Arabia do?

Not allowing countries close to Russia and China dominate in the region and now allowing Saudi Arabia fall within their sphere of influence either. Again, too many factors and it probably just got too complicated for you.

&gt;Need I remind you of all the shit they do?

No need, I know very well the shit they do.

&gt;Neither did we when that intervention started

Genocidal government deserves to be attacked.

&gt;Though I'm sure some would consider the Estonian SS divisions a high enough degree, regardless of prior circumstances.

Some people are ignorant indeed. The Estonian SS-Division was not a criminal organization and later even guarded Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg.

&gt;Or really, why?

For its genocidal actions.

&gt;And if we did, then a lot more countries did

I don't argue with you here.

&gt;including pretty much all the other warring states here, plus of course your beloved US.

No.

&gt;They've all caused a lot of death and destruction and all were done for geopolitical reasons. Some did have approval, other's not. Either way, it's all worse than what Russia's done.

World War II caused a lot of death and destruction, but it doesn't mean that all countries fighting in it were guilty of anything.

&gt;It's not much of an excuse but it means Russia didn't seek conflict on the other side of the planet but in their backyard.

How is colonialism against your neighbours any better than colonialism overseas?

&gt;I'm not talking about your two countries cooperation

Yes you are.

&gt;I'm talking about your comments here

I'm defending facts and criticizing criminals and people, who support them.

&gt;which do thread the line of ""dicksucking"" considering you're excusing just about any wrongdoing of the US, more so than any American I see. That's why I referred to that.

Sticking to facts is not really what a sane person would call ""dicksucking"".

&gt;Sorry if you find it offensive, I won't say that again.

Good, because you'd only discredit yourself.

&gt;You're excusing everything they do.

Mediocre strawman.

&gt;In this comment alone you excuse their support for all sorts of dictators.

Because that's usually better than any realistic alternative.

&gt;You did though, check the dictator part again.

Nope, still didn't say they didn't do anything wrong. I hinted that what you referred to wasn't necessarily wrong. That's not the same.

&gt;This is like talking to someone who based their opinion on Hollywood movies.

Rather through higher education on the matter. Do you possess any?

&gt;Seriously, it sounds childish.

Better than sounding brainwashed.

&gt;I mean, was the US the good guy in, say, the 2003 invasion of Iraq

Good guy? Yes. Was it in the right? Legally, fuck no. Morally? Perhaps as Hussein was a totalitarian dictatorship that deserved to be taken out. However, the means how the country was supposed to be rebuilt, were rather ineffective - there's no point in taking out a dictator if you don't have a plan for the country's future.

However, it is pretty much universally understood that the invasion of Iraq was illegal. It is however very incorrect to simply group it together with all the other conflicts you mentioned, hence my criticism about you apparently not knowing much about these conflicts - I would not have grouped them together like that.

&gt;Seriously though, way I see it your hatred of Russia for what they've done to your country has clouded your judgement

No, education is what ""clouds"" my judgment. You should try it.

&gt;so much so that you need to convince yourself that their biggest enemy, your now biggest ally, is actually somehow a good guy

A democratic country fighting against dictatorships - a good country in the eyes of a sane person indeed.

&gt;I guess to make you feel better.

Doesn't affect my well-being the least.

&gt;In other terms you feel the need to make the world black and white

Lawyers tend to argue a lot and regard things as either right or wrong.

&gt;with the good guys, you of course being a part of them

Yes, part of the democratic world that despises dictatorships. You wouldn't know.

&gt;and the bad guys, of course lead by Russia. It's childish.

How is considering hostile criminal dictatorships as bad childish again?

&gt;Again, I hate the US but have no intention of calling Russia, or China for that matter, good guys, cause all 3 are evil.

And that is a fundamentally sick and brainwashed world view.

&gt;Yes I do. But looking at all of them it's safe to say they've taken far, far more than they've saved.

You cannot possibly know that.

Farage, the hardest of the hard brexiters, put on a bus that after a brexit, there'd be 350m a week extra to spend on the NHS. That's not ""this'll cost money, but it'll be worth it"", that's proactively ""this'll save us insane amounts of money"".

All the time. Pro-brexit people consistently argued fears were unfounded because they could be like Norway, and then turn around and argue for a brexit that contained none of the restrictions put upon Norway.

&gt;Becoming a political union, or federal nation like USA or Germany is not an inherent necessity to making trade deals.

That's a beautiful, dramatic sentiment, but it's also an entirely fact-free sentence. I mean, the UK was not a part of Schengen or the Euro, there's no coherent European defense policy, and what foreign policy is done on a EU-level is almost exclusively about foreign trade.

Or maybe they won't bother, they might figure it makes it nice change from centuries of not doing it. Shouldn't really matter either way, should it?

There's also nothing wrong with being exclusionary. Not all cultures are equal, and we need to stop pretending as much. Again, nobody is owed entry into Hungary, it's perfectly acceptable for them to be discerning when it comes to who's allowed in.

4447,"&gt; The first major study, commissioned early in 2018, estimated that no deal would reduce growth by 7% over the next 10 years, compared with a scenario where the UK stayed in the EU.
In June, Finance Minister Pashcal Donohoe said a ""disorderly Brexit"" could cost 55,000 Irish jobs within two years and a further 30,000 over the longer term.
His summer economic statement assessed that no deal would cause ""severe disruption to Irish-UK bilateral trade"", presenting a ""clear and present danger to domestic living standards"".
He did not forecast a recession but suggested that growth would be close to zero in 2020 if there were no deal.
The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (similar to the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility) was perhaps even gloomier in its most recent report.
It concluded that no deal ""poses profound risks"" to Ireland's public finances and that the government had limited scope to respond.
The council warned that the capacity to spend more to mitigate the impact of no deal was ""limited by the fact that the government debt burden remains high"".
Why would Ireland be damaged?
The UK and Ireland are major trading partners and a no-deal Brexit would disrupt that trade through the imposition of tariffs (taxes on imports) and other barriers.
It is important to keep this trade relationship in perspective.
The UK is not Ireland's biggest export market and has not been for years.
The US is actually the largest external market, taking 27% of all goods exported in 2017.
But the UK is number two - in 2017 12% of Ireland's goods exports, worth 16.5bn euros (£14.8bn), were sold to the UK.",England,/r/europe/comments/cj9v4v/brexit_what_would_no_deal_mean_for_ireland/evbxmk7/,Bloke22,1564399240

4453,"In the war of coffe pods, there is a new David that wins against Goliath. In this case we are talking about a piedmontese company, the Bisio Progette, that has won the lawsuit against Nestlè and will be able to produce it’s coffe pods compatible with the Dolce gusto system, the one produced by the great swiss multinational. As decided by the judges of the tibunal of Milan – ordinance 4235 of 2019 – who thus have closed an issue that carried on since december 2016.
At the center of the argument are the capsules of the Dolce Gusto line, a market that in Europe is wort around 5 billion units every year. The Bisio Porgetti – with a business of 59 million euros and 200 employees – is a company from Alessandria which is a part of the Guala industrial group which works on the injections of plastic materials in the pharmaceutical, medical, cosmetic, and food fields. And its exactly in the food sector that it has developed a specific competence in the research and development, design and production of pods for coffe and other soluble bevareges.
Three years ago the company turned to the tribunal of Milan (the section specialised in commercial matters), for a lawsuit of negative assesment of the counterfeiting of the Nestlè patents. “basically – explain Alberto Camusso and Chiara de Cesero, the lawyers of Bisio, from the Jacobacci e associati of Turin – we asked a judge’s opinion on the wether or not the pods for coffe or soluble beverages currently produced and sold by the Bisio Progetti, compatible with the Dolce Gusto of Nestlè, didn’t constitute an infrigment of the related patents. A usefull “instrument” for companies that want to clear situations of uncertainty on the legitemacy of their products, in order to correctly plan their production and to avoid uneccesary arguments and possibile legal attacks” Of course Nestlè had a different opinion and thus was born a long and heated legal debate. Thus the tribunal decided to entrust a technical analysis to a group of three consultants chosen by the judge,
The past 14th of jenuary the first ordinance was decided (n. 66729-2016), with which the tribunal had completely agreed with Bisio Porgetti and accerted that the pods did not violate Nestlè’s patents. The swiss company immediatly applied in appeal. The 12th of july, the judge’s collage of the tibunal of Milan (Claudio Marangoni, Anna Bellesi e Pier Luigi Perrotti) rejected the appeal of the multinational, fully confirming the ordinance of jenuary 2019 a thus reafferming that the Bisio pods currently on the market do not violate Nestlè’s patents, the company ha salso been sentenced to pay the trial’s expenses. A definitive decision since the ordinance cannot be subject to further appeal.

4471,"This is one of those statistics which looks good in a newspaper but is meaningless because it doesn't account for dependence. It's meant to downplay the importance and integration of the JIT chain to people who don't deal with it. 

Example

Distributor A supplies Product A to 99 businesses in the UK. In order to make Product A they need a chemical manufactured in Germany.

This is why discussing this matter is pointless on this sub. You, and many others, don't seem to know anything about international trade or economics, and just want to make this into some kind of Trumpian trade war to punish the UK as some kind of moral crusade. You would rather harm your own economies provided it hurts the UK more, which is a massively childish and illogical economic strategy, but that's because it's not about economics or trade for you, it's about some moral outrage at the notion that the UK voted not to be part of the glorious, benevolent European Union that is the source of all that is holy and righteous somehow.

But with companies in neighboring Poland also facing a severe labor shortage, most Ukranians have opted to go there, lured by higher wages and friendlier labor-immigration policies.

Hungary has already accepted Syrian and Egyptian **Christian** refugees, who were discriminated against by their fellow Muslim refugees. Hungarians in general have a problem with Muslim immigrants who come from Bangladesh and claim to be refugees to get free welfare. The government is not PC enough to hide this sentiment, so they say it outright: we are a Christian country and we don't want people or foreign culture to violently come and change our culture.

4571,"&gt;The MO of the pro-brexit camp has consistently been to lie their asses off

I disagree. That has been the MO of Theresa May and her ilk, who purposely tried to stave off Brexit, by conjuring up a ""deal"" befitting a vasal state's surrender, and then trying to get all politics to revolve around it, as no one was expected to accept it. None of them wanted the responsibility of being the one who executed Brexit.

The very grounds for Brext, namely the growing power and influence of EU in U.K. politics, as well as the lack of proper democratic structure in the EU, was not and has not been a lie. 

If you support proper representative democracy in the EU, as well as U.K. sovereignty in U.K. territory, then you are either for Brexit or for trying to change EU. What separate these two camps is merely the belief that EU's influence over U.K. territory can be minimized back to the level of a simple trade union, as well as changing the basic structure of EU. Brexiteers do not believe this to be possible, remainers who want changes to EU does. Neither side holds to their position out of malice to the other part - believing so is asinine.",,/r/europe/comments/cj59b5/boris_johnson_to_unveil_biggest_ad_campaign_since/evbshvo/,GingerPepsiMax,1564392199

Hardly, Brexit is a clusterfuck that has exposed how vulnerable nations are to disinformation, lies and corruption. The reasons for Brexit are laughable and to think that the UK is going to be stronger afterwards is equally so.

Well maybe number 3 but with a large margin to 1 and 2.


&gt; Downplaying that doesn't help. If the E.U. was originally happy to just let Britain stay, why is it so ridiculous to have a deal which lets them back in the future once things shake up a bit politically.

I thought we covered this already? Because Britain hasn't shown any indication in wanting such a deal. 
 
&gt; Anything else is just either pride or a desire to use Great Britain's political seizure against it's people.

So offering Britain a deal it has not asked is taking advantage of them? What a weird sentiment.

Everyone has their idea of what the deal should be, all those ideas are different, and since only 48% of the country (or whatever) even support the idea at all anymore, of *course* none of the deals are going to get anywhere near majority support.

4839,"&gt; since we will have to come up with a lot more useless jobs if we want to keep capitalism going around the world with the incoming amounts of automation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy

&gt;In economics, the lump of labour fallacy is the misconception that there is a fixed amount of work—a lump of labour—to be done within an economy which can be distributed to create more or fewer jobs. It was considered a fallacy in 1891 by economist David Frederick Schloss, who held that the amount of work is not fixed.[1]
&gt;
&gt; The term originated to rebut the idea that reducing the number of hours employees are allowed to labour during the working day would lead to a reduction in unemployment. The term is also commonly used to describe the belief that increasing labour productivity, immigration, or automation causes an increase in unemployment. Whereas some argue immigrants displace a country's workers, others believe this to be a fallacy by arguing that the number of jobs in the economy is not fixed and that immigration increases the size of the economy, thus creating more jobs.[2][3]

4858,"Again, you’re confusing the future consequences of Brexit with the mechanics of actually leaving the EU. Nobody is asking for “the EU to soften the effects of the UK's stupid decision”, as you put it. The UK Parliament has made it quite clear that they will not accept the backstop. That’s it. That’s **the only issue** holding up the withdrawal agreement being ratified.

For what it’s worth, the UK side pointed this out before negotiations even began, but May’s government somehow forgot or were too stupid to remember it.

Basically, the UK originally wanted one overarching withdrawal + free trade agreement. The EU instead insisted that these should be separate negotiations, and we’re dealing with the first part now.

This creates a massive issue for the Irish border - everybody expects that, at the end of both negotiations, there won’t be a need for a hard border, but how can you guarantee that if you haven’t negotiated the trade agreement yet? You can’t.

That means they had to introduce this “backstop” idea, to guarantee that even if the trade negotiations break down, there still won’t be a hard border. This involves keeping either NI or the entire UK in a customs union with the EU, from which they can never escape. The EU would have total leverage in those negotiations, knowing the UK basically has no ability to refuse. No country would agree to that. Even though I don’t agree that Brexit is a good move for the country, I definitely don’t think that the UK should accept the backstop as it is.

The UK Parliament has proposed several changes to the backstop - including giving the UK the right to leave it if trade negotiations fail, or time-limiting it, but the EU has refused to make any changes whatsoever.

All of this could have been avoided if both negotiations took place at the same time. You wouldn’t even need a backstop. So yes, there is certainly blame on both sides. And none of this has to do with funding promises on buses or anything of that sort - those are all future consequences that we will discover as they happen.",,/r/europe/comments/cixoek/in_anticipation_of_a_nodeal_brexit_six_hundred/evbe09z/,kawag,1564374016

Germany has a paper army that will fall apart as soon as it comes under duress. They are fully reliant on Poland to act as a meat shield, and if Russia ever invaded Poland Germany would throw them under the bus immediately and capitulate to the Russians.

4960,"It all began when ruling pro-Austrian dynasty of Serbia, the Obrenovic dynasty, was deposed and replaced by the pro-Russian Karadjorjdevic dynasty in 1903. Up to that point, Serbia and Austria-Hungary were secret allies under the terms of the so-called Secret Convention. Serbia wasn't on the best terms with Bulgaria, due to the Serbo-Bulgarian War a few decades earlier, when Serbia attacked Bulgaria, attempting to stop the Unification of free Bulgaria with its lands still held by Ottomans. Bulgaria won easily and Austria-Hungary had to threaten them with war in order to get them to back off.
 
After the assassination of king and queen in 1903, the engineers of the coup organized themselves into a secret military society called the ""Black Hand"", with their aim being the unification of all South Slavs. This pretty much turned Austria-Hungary into an enemy of Serbia overnight.

Fast foward a few years later, after a bunch of mutual provocations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, we the Balkan countries (Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece) realized it was finally the time to kick out the Turks. So we did that in 1912. But mutual mistrust between Serbia and Bulgaria and territorial disputes over the conquered territories led to Bulgaria attacking Serbia and Greece in 1913. They lost hard, and this led to Romania and Turkey invading Bulgaria too like a bunch of jackals, forcing them to sue for peace.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/cj07tb/war_to_end_all_wars/evb59yl/,maximus-butterworth,1564366244

This all comes down to the backstop and Northern Ireland, and no country would accept the terms in the withdrawal agreement. May made a huge mistake by ever agreeing to it.

4986,"Boris Johnson is to launch the biggest advertising campaign since the Second World War to get Britain ready for no-deal with an unprecedented marketing blitz on billboards, radio and television. 

Tens of millions of pounds will be spent on what will become the biggest public information campaign since the end of the war over the next three months, Government sources said. The news came as the Government goes into overdrive to prepare for a no-deal exit with daily briefings on progress in the Cobra briefing room normally reserved for coordinating responses to national emergencies.

Sajid Javid, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, will set out plans this week - on Tuesday or Wednesday - for an extra £1billion of spending on no deal preparations. Part of this will be up to £100million on the public information campaign, dwarfing the lacklustre radio and internet campaign run by the Government before the March 29 Brexit deadline this year.

The new campaign, which could include a leaflet delivered to every home in the country, will be much bigger than the 'Tell Sid' bid to encourage the public to buy shares at the privatisation of British Gas and 'Aids - Don't Die of Ignorance' TV, radio and newspaper awareness campaigns in the 1980s.

One Treasury source said: ""I can't imagine there has been a bigger 'comms' campaign than this since the War. It is a pretty huge thing for a 'comms' campaign.""

Ministers said the extra spending was part of a "" real step up in activity"" on no deal planning. Rishi Sunak, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We are turbo charging preparations for no deal and that is now the government’s number one priority.""

The objective, he said, was to force Brussels negotiators to remove the Northern Irish backstop from the EU Withdrawal Agreement to allow the UK to leave with a deal by Oct 31.
He told Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News: ""We want to remove this undemocratic backstop from the existing agreement but if the EU is not willing to talk about that then it’s right that we prepare properly with conviction.""

Mr Johnson's Cabinet met yesterday by phone for an hour starting at 11.30am to approve three new committees that are intended to turbocharge preparations for leaving the EU without a deal by October 31.

The three committees are intended to bring to an end the delay which beset the committees established under Theresa May to tackle Brexit, Mr Johnson said.

A Number 10 source said Mr Johnson ""wanted to convey that he wished to avoid committees of the past which had not moved quickly enough, did not result in actions or accountability and were often undermined by parallel structures. 

""[The] Cabinet agreed that this would send a clear message about the Government’s plans to deliver Brexit.""

Mr Johnson and Michael Gove, the Chancellor to the Duchy of Lancaster, will convene a 'war Cabinet' of just six ministers including Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Chancellor Sajid Javid to monitor progress.

This ""Exit Strategy Committee"" will meet twice weekly on Mondays and Thursdays.

Mr Gove will also chair - with Mr Sunak - a separate daily meeting in the Cobra room to monitor progress and ""kick important issues"" to Mr Johnson where necessary.

The Cabinet was told that ""live actions, deadlines and accountability [will] be on the screens of Cobr at every meeting and minutes will be circulated immediately after"" from this ""Daily Operations Committee"".

Mr Johnson will also chair an ""Exit Strategy Committee"" which will meet regularly, will have a broad remit and will be ""particularly focused on Britain’s future relationships around the world"".

The membership of all three committees is due to be published later today (Monday). One Number 10 source said that holding ""the daily meetings show that we are serious about no deal.""
The source said that people should not get carried away by suggesting that Cobra had been ""convened"" to tackle a crisis.

The room - officially known as Cabinet Office Briefing Room A - was the most convenient because of the screens and IT available there.

The source added: ""The Cabinet agreed there is a very clear message that we are serious about what we are doing and getting ready to leave on Oct 31.""

5012,"I saw Ireland jump in 2015. 

&gt; On 12 July 2016, the Irish Central Statistics Office published its latest national accounts data for
&gt; 2015, revealing that real GDP growth was up 26.3% from 2014 (and up 32.4% in current prices)
&gt; These figures have attracted considerable attention in the international press, with commentators
&gt; raising questions about their reliability and about the conceptual basis for the measurement of GDP.
&gt; The main reason for the particularly high Irish GDP growth rates lies in the fact that in recent years,
&gt; attracted in large part by low corporation tax rates, a number of large multinational corporations
&gt; have relocated their economic activities, and more specifically their underlying intellectual property,
&gt; to Ireland. As a result, sales (production) generated from the use of intellectual property now
&gt; contribute to Irish GDP rather than to other countries’ GDP. Given the size of these companies, the
&gt; boost to GDP growth has been correspondingly large.

&gt; OK put a 1 km measurement in a picture and show me. And don't turn off paths.

&gt; Don't move the goal post. I didn't say it wasn't a forest I said that is was a cultivated forest. 

Answer me this question: **have you ever been there**?

You claimed it was all planted in rows. That was bullshit. You claimed it wasn't ""wild"" like ""most forests in Europe"". That was bullshit. You demanded I zoom in and it would show all sorts of traces of cultivation. That was bullshit.

On, and on, and on.

&gt; When comparing a natural forest with a cultivated forest, managed for its timber, there are several differences; in cultivated forests there is little biodiversity since cultivated forests usually consist of one species of trees, have few generations of trees, often only one; and there are no dead trees, lacking habitat for numerous creatures.

http://companies-in-ecologies.blogspot.com/

The Veluwe was a natural forest, then destroyed by man, then restored by man, a long time ago. You are oversimplifying a region you barely understand, because you're being contrarian.

&gt; Then you said that you lived there and it isn't cultivated so i asked you to show me. You max zoomed on google ad found 2 football fields with out a path (maybe). 

You asked me to zoom in, and I did, and found your claims to be nonsense. You then started sputtering and asking for additional ""tasks"". Which I'm just going to laugh at and ignore.

&gt; If you look at a zoom of min 1 km any where i that forest you will see signs of cultivation.

5237,"As is common in the Balkans, lots of things are at play. 

When the migrant crisis started in 2015, Croatia was a popular route to Europe for migrants, the goal to be to get to Schengen so they can go anywhere in Europe. First Hungary's Trump closed their border with Croatia. That pushed all the migrants through Slovenia, so Slovenia closed their borders with Croatia.

Plus there is still a border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia dating to the break up of Yugoslavia. Slovenia blocked Croatia's accession to the EU to extract concessions, probably looking to do it again for Schengen.

Schengen is crazy though. I'm always blown away that I can travel between countries and never show identification to anyone. If I check a bag at the airport I show my passport. But if I carry on, my passport won't leave my pocket. Technically you do have to carry then though.

5421,"Europe’s leaders have failed to anticipate the risks of an overnight UK exit  

This is a dangerous moment for the EU. It says that it is prepared for a no-deal Brexit, but we all know this is not true. The European Commission has readied itself on a technical level. But this is not the kind of preparedness that matters. EU leaders have not yet braced their voters for the economic impact of a large EU country leaving the customs union and the single market overnight.  

The EU is right not to take the new British prime minister’s provocations at face value. They are designed for a domestic audience. But when the rest of Europe’s economies are slowing down sharply, it must prepare for the shock of a no-deal Brexit. I would advise EU leaders to look in the mirror and test whether their determination to uphold the Irish backstop would still hold in the hours before the advancing deadline. It is one thing to claim solidarity with Ireland as a principle; another to tell factory workers who stand to lose their jobs that this is a price worth paying. The tough negotiating stance was, at least in part, informed by assuming a near-zero probability for a no-deal outcome.  

I have argued before that this assumption was complacent. The probability was at no point anywhere close to zero. It increased when Boris Johnson emerged as the winner of the Conservative leadership contest. But it never made sense to attach ultra-low probabilities to a legal default position. Especially when there were no House of Commons majorities for the alternatives under European law: ratification of the withdrawal agreement or unilateral revocation of Article 50 by the UK.  

An unintended consequence of the campaign for a second referendum was to increase the probability of no-deal further. The campaigners managed to kill off Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement while failing to generate enough momentum to pave the way to revocation — a combination that left the UK in no-deal territory. Unwittingly, they turned themselves into the hard-Brexit campaign’s useful idiots.  

Remainers should have taken the deal. It would have ensured a close relationship with the EU while keeping the option of rejoining in the future open. A no-deal Brexit closes it for a generation.  

The EU has been complicit in this miscalculation. No one more so than Donald Tusk, the outgoing president of the European Council. He explicitly supported a second referendum and interfered in the European election campaign in the UK by supporting a pro-Remain candidate. His interventions had two simultaneous effects. It gave Remainers in the UK the false hope that the EU would intervene on their behalf, and be successful. And it led Europeans to underestimate the risk of a no-deal Brexit.  

Whenever I go back to Germany, there is always somebody asking whether the UK might reconsider. The German media covered Brexit almost exclusively from the perspective of the second referendum campaign. These days, they write about Mr Johnson’s buffoonery. A no-deal Brexit, its economic impact on regions and sectors, and on the EU’s geostrategic interests are hard to spot on political radar screens.  

One reason is that the EU has been lucky during its many crises. Alexis Tsipras blinked during the Greek government’s showdown with the Commission in 2015. So did the great Charles De Gaulle when he ended the so-called “empty chair” policy in 1966. If the leaders of Greece and France blinked, then so surely will Mr Johnson, a lesser figure.  

I think it would be unwise for the EU to lose sight of Brexit’s uniqueness. The political incentives for Mr Johnson are different from those of non-departing EU leaders. First, the EU might want to reflect on its persistent failure to understand the support for Brexit in the UK, as evidenced by two general elections, one European election, a Brexit referendum, and the emergence of Mr Johnson as prime minister. There is a pattern here.  

EU leaders should also reflect on their own mistakes. They should have made it clear from the start that they would not extend the Brexit deadline in March this year. If they had followed this advice, the withdrawal treaty may have had a fighting chance. The tactical error they committed by turning Brexit into a three-way bet was foolish. Each step of the way — the European elections, the Tory leadership contest and the political dynamics that have followed — the UK moved further and further towards a hard Brexit.  

Only a fool would try to predict the course of British politics over the next three months. A no-deal Brexit is a possible outcome but not the only one. I expect Mr Johnson to try to unite the pro-Brexit vote, and to pitch himself against a splintered Remain opposition. This would seem to be an intelligent strategy. There is one prediction I am willing to make: if this ends in a no-deal Brexit, much of the EU will not have seen it coming.",,/r/europe/comments/cix07u/the_eu_must_prepare_for_a_nodeal_brexit/ev9o8e6/,throwaway33282191489,1564327045

It'd be good if all emergency services could answer everyone in whatever language but it's not the case, and you can't expect a country to provide service in foreign languages. I mean, I live in Flanders and I don't even expect emergency services here to understand French when it's a national language (let alone German).

For how long? Some governments have lasted shorter than it's been since the Brexit vote. Democracy doesn't work in such a way that you have one vote and then never vote ever again.

It's clear that whatever is happening now and whatever will happen is not really what was voted on. Do another vote and check the pulse of the people, rather than playing a guessing game with the MPs.

If a second referendum ended up with another yes for Brexit, it should be much easier to make Brexit happen because nobody will be able to claim the people didn't want this or that. Now they know what is at stake and will have affirmed it.

If the second referendum were to be a no for Brexit, the UK would avoid doing something very harmful which a majority of people do not want.

&gt;In April 2000, Heinz Loquai, a retired German brigadier general, published a book on the war that claimed that the German government's account had been based on a general analysis by a Bulgarian intelligence agency of Yugoslav behaviour in the war, which was turned into a specific ""plan"" by the German Defence Ministry.

So yeah, it didn't exist. 

&gt;or a significant number of Serbian military commanders managed to be a total piece of shit in a same way at the same time. 

That happens when you start terrorizing and slaughtering and bombing people for defending themselves.

&gt;Lol. No. Serbian military and police did that. Not the bombing. 

Then how did the majority of those refugees start moving after the bombing started?

&gt;The reason is actually irrelevant. 

ofc it's irrelevant since your point is dead.

&gt;The bottom line is that Serbians did manage to do those horrible things. 

So we 'expelled' by your words, 900k Albanians, who then returned.
While 150k Serbs were expelled and can't return to this day. 90% of the Roma were expelled as well.

Which crime is worse?

&gt;This is not a competition of who did most evil. One bad doesn’t remove other.

5692,"&gt;Yes, but I also said it's the minority of cases.

Reported cases.

&gt; If being in a group lowers the chance of being assaulted, then it's logical solo travelers are at more risk, which would make sense that they make up most of the statistics above if we're talking about assault from strangers.

Your point being? We don't know what the share of groups and solo people is in your links, we don't know if they are traveling or not (being in a strange place can put you more at risk and have you stand out).

&gt;Besides, if you're dismissing the data because it's not specific enough in your case and it doesn't explicitly mention this particular case, then you might as well dismiss it in every other discussion ever because it will never be as specific as you want... Quite convenient to argue this way if you don't like the conclusions.

I am dismissing data because they are not relevant to this situation. If you brought in data comparing male to female solo travelers and them being at risk of assault you'd have a point. Just throwing data around from 1) all situations piled together and 2) not even the country in question, is not really relevant.

I would also argue that being raped would be a bit more traumatizing compared to being hit and have your wallet stolen for example.

The EU is a union where ALL members are winning by being a part of , and at the same time also lose in some other aspects. 

Greece issued a 7 year bond where it wanted to raise 2.5 billion Euros. It raised 12.5 instead. Which is great news, and I hope the same applies to the 10 year one. Greek bonds are getting better , but still are not in any way considered of ""high value"". However it is still great that they raised 12.5 instead if 2.5!

But I'll give my 2 cents.

Democracy is, as said many times, the best of the worst. Without something better, we should still push for it. (Since it's the best we got, so far.)

It needs a ton of fixes and patches, though, even to work in a ""good enough"" manner. 

For example, if 51% of the people want to murder someone, or burn a town... or do something more benign than that but equally imoral or stupid, we have the need for laws and regulations, to prevent that simple majority to inflict harm against either minorities and/or everyone in general. Or else it would be madness.

Now, putting that aside (as the best system so far), if we do a thought exercise:

In order to exercise the most efficient, sustainable, rational way to manage our planet/countries/resources... 

... leaving some of those decisions to *just* the (populistically influenceable) uneducated vote of the population, is not the wisest or smartest thing to do, at all. 

Even if everyone should have the ability to have a say, it doesn't need to be through a 1/1 irrational method of exercising such democratic power, such as with an oversimplistic ""vote"".

Plato recalls his master Socrates talking to a pupil and saying something of the sort:

If you're lost at sea, on a ship, with a crew representative of the human population (sailors included):
Who would you rather be deciding on what course to take towards safe harbour? 

The vote of the majority, or the rational decision of the navigators, with their tools and knowledge?

...

So, that exemplifies the possibility of a better type of equalitarian system. One where objective decisions would be arrived at through data, via scientific consensus, where everyone would be allowed to contribute (as long as they went through the proper channels, in an organised, coherent way)...

... While subjective decisions would be arrived at just as they are today. (Trying to please as much people as possible, presenting multiple versions, etc etc.)

A much more rational way of a societal management system where the power resides in the people, but is channeled in a wiser way.

This, of course, it's not something where we flick a switch and we're there, but instead, a continuous, progressive change, through decades.

It would be more favorable for us to have the shores in Anatolia but we don't so we live with that. What you're basically saying here is that you want more percentage of the sea than what everyone else would be getting, cause islands are close to your shores but that's not equity, except for only in your eyes i suppose. Looking at [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Odysseas_Christou/publication/308523760/figure/fig1/AS:409764199714817@1474706806436/Republic-of-Cyprus-Exclusive-Economic-Zone.png) i don't see why Turkey should have waters right west of Cyprus, unless Cyprus can have its own waters right south of Antalya for example. Every country in the region gets its equal share of sea.

The only assymetric demands here are made by Turkey because it can't digest that it doesn't have the islands / sea that it'd like to have. You can't ignore 50 islands and get a ""fair share"" of the Aegean when you don't even have islands there (except for 2). Most other countries (if not all) seem to dismiss Turkey's claims so sure, stick to your gunboat diplomacy and casus beli and we'll work like that but Turkey is not being wronged here just cause it doesn't get some extra than what everyone else is. 

&gt; The ICJ tribunals regularly abandon the equidistance principle on the basis of equity under UNCLOS 1982. I can provide you with tribunal decision examples if you'd like. 

I'm all for the two countries settling this in court but Turkey claimed and the court ruled that it has no jurisdiction over that i think.

Anyway we've been through this whole topic before and nothing came out of it. But to return to the original point that the other user was making, it's not like Greece kept Turkey out of the agreements with the other countries out of spite.

What makes you think our government is trying to hold onto the union.

Northern ireland, money pit, which gets more cash per person than any other region of the UK, offers very little.

Scotland, gets more money than any other part of Britain, apart from North Sea oil which will dry up someday, or we become less dependent on it, offers very little.

The fact is, a Tory government would be better off with just England, or England and Wales, both in votes and in finance, since we spend more on those two countries than we get back.

Now you could say x area of England doesn't produce much...this is true, but it's in England so it can't be disposed of in the way I believe many people hope NI and Scotland are...by them voting to leave.

We will undoubtedly see people here saying bullshit like ""the empire is finally dying"" or shite like that (despite Scotland being p4p the worst when it came to empire)....but the fact is, England would be better off financiall without them.

Even if you shoot them, say with a Glock 17 while they run at you, even multiple times, they still have a high chance of reaching you and injuring and possibly killing you. It's nothing like in movies. If they don't attack, you also don't shoot them but wait for backup and using the right tools you disarm and restrain them.

For guns vs guns there are firearms officers and holding a gun doesn't make you safer in regards to getting shot at and dying. Where I live they have guns and already in school policemen show up and tell you about police business, violence, drugs etc. In my case there was a commander telling about knife attacks and how you hardly stand a chance.

I think the best addition against knives are stab proof armor vests as knives will always be dangerous. Guns would not reduce the number of attacks and do nothing about knife attacks and murders between civilians.",,/r/europe/comments/ciizvx/police_shoot_armed_man_in_helsinki_ninth_fatal/ev90jse/,Kr0et,1564299724

5871,"I'm not sure what kind of apocalyptic war scenario you have in mind or against whom but i'm pretty sure you're stretching it more than how the other user meant the whole ""rely on Greece"" thing. If that's your interpretation then almost no country can rely on Turkey either. Very few countries would enter war and endager their own people and sovereignty over another country and it depends on the circumstances so that's a pretty specific and stretched scenario. In case of war, Greece and Turkey are NATO allies bound to support each other from external threats. If Turkey invoked article 5 then Greece would come to its aid. You could say i'm wrong but i think Erdogan is more likely to appear petty in such cases.

Everything is intelligent diplomacy in politics (or at least it's mean to be). Every country including Turkey looks to its own interests. It's in Greece's best interests to have friendly relations with Turkey, being neighbors and all. Personally i'd like nothing more and i'm not even talking on a political level. The two people have a lot in common and if anything it's the nationalistic stuff and the politics that get in the way. 

It's a weird argument though.

5886,"&gt; Like it or not, islands are part of the country. If the geography doesn't favor you then idk.. you shouldn't have lost those islands i guess? It would be more favorable for us to have the shores in Anatolia but we don't so we live with that. What you're basically saying here is that you want more percentage of the sea than what everyone else would be getting, cause islands are close to your shores but that's not equity, except for only in your eyes i suppose. Looking at this i don't see why Turkey should have waters right west of Cyprus, unless Cyprus can have its own waters right south of Antalya for example. Every country in the region gets its equal share of sea.

Actually, Turkey ""gets"" a much smaller share of the sea if the equidistance principle is followed to the letter. The ICJ tribunals have abandoned the principle to rectify such situations. They also in a few cases completely ignored an island as a basepoint for EEZ demarcation, meaning that it's as if it didn't exist for this legal purpose.

You are speaking from a very simplistic, memorized idea of what's ""fair"". You aren't speaking of international law principles and agreements anymore. You've changed your argument.

&gt; The only assymetric demands here are made by Turkey because it can't digest that it doesn't have the islands / sea that it'd like to have. You can't ignore 50 islands and get a ""fair share"" of the Aegean when you don't even have islands there (except for 2). Most other countries (if not all) seem to dismiss Turkey's claims so sure, stick to your gunboat diplomacy and casus beli and we'll work like that but Turkey is not being wronged here just cause it doesn't get some extra than what everyone else is.

Most countries went along with the EEZ and territorial water extensions because there were no opposing countries to create such problems. Why would there be any big problems in the Black Sea? There are no relevant islands. The only islands that could have been relevant have been completely ignored by the tribunal. So _some_ islands clearly are not entitled to extending EEZ claims. Again, you're abandoning the intricacies of international law.

And mind you, Turkey is not seeking a ""fair share"" but instead asserting the pre-1982 status quo, which it is entitled to do as it has not ratified any treaty amending that 1982 legal environment.

&gt; I'm all for the two countries settling this in court but Turkey claimed and the court ruled that it has no jurisdiction over that i think.

It doesn't, the ICJ confirms this. Not until UNCLOS 1982 is ratified by Turkey or some similar binding agreement between Greece and Turkey is reached, granting the ICJ jurisdiction. This is perfectly in line with international law norms. States are sovereign and they can't be held accountable by non-state institutions they haven't granted powers to.

&gt; Anyway we've been through this whole topic before and nothing came out of it. But to return to the original point that the other user was making, it's not like Greece kept Turkey out of the agreements with the other countries out of spite. Turkey was not involved because it doesn't agree with Greece and Cyprus on its claims regarding the EEZ while the other countries all seem to be backing Cyprus's position in the area.

As long as you're not saying that Turkey is breaching international law by _not recognizing_ said EEZ claims, which you were above, this is fine. As an addendum: Greece and Cyprus fully intended to keep Turkey out of the deal and constructed it as such, ignoring all UNCLOS principles that are not derived from equidistance. They intended only to cement their claims. The relative success of this tactic will be clearer when we have the benefit of hindsight.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/ci456w/russia_turkey_may_start_joint_exploration_in/ev90yz4/,_Whoop,1564300327
