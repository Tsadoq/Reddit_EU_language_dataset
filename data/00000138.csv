98,"&gt; The West was built off of the back of Christianity. That's just a fact. Christianity and the West have been in a state of constant evolution and compromise, weaving around each other to get to the stage we're at.

Western progress did not materially start until secularism, and a clear distancing from Christianity, started to become norm. What you term as 'compromise' was in fact a series of one-sides defeats for Christianity. The West went from a position where the pope could call massive wars to one where he was reduced to a ranting old man few people in power actually paid any real attention to.

It is to stop britain doing a seperate non EU deal with  the Dominican republic or France with Guiana.  There was no reason to interpret it as applying here. The EU did so for its own reasons and outplayed the morons sent by our government.

417,"&gt; Do you mean buy? There is no need for them to develop technologies that are already available. They can buy systems that are available for sale.

No, developing is right.
Until 10-15 years ago you couldn't really buy this technology from the shelf, only on a smaller scale.
Today it's way better, but even now there are some things that are open.
Energy storage as an example.

&gt; I don't think that currently western countries are at the top of the table of CO2 emissions, with the exception of the US.

Prague does not sit on any real deposts of slate, unlike for instance cities like Paris. As a result historically the buildings in the city used roofs made of wood shingles. However, after numerous fires (especially 1541 and later ones in the early 18th century) established firecodes in the 18th and 19th centuries required these wood shingles to be replaced with fired clay tiles, which are non-combustible. As a result, Prague's roof lines have been traditionally orange tinted from the clay used in these tiles. In the early 20th century, the development of sheet metal and aluminium roofing lead to combinations of the 2 materials and the sheeting was traditionally painted a similar orange to harmonize (this is however not visible in the core city center).

Today, when buildings are renovated, they generally must keep the profile and materiality they had before.

496,"The topic is a bit complicated. But I agree with you that analysing their culture with a Western cultural lens is kind of pointless. I also agree that they lack ethnocentrism - at least publicly. Many South Asian muslims often get treated as 3rd class citizens. There is a clear, unspoken racial hierachy in Islam. Arabs are usually at the top, given that most of early Islamic history transpired in their countries and largely by other Arabs. Then comes Turks/Iranians, who both have large empires. And then everyone else. 

I seem to recall that ISIS leaders complained about Chechen fighters ""flying the Chechen flag above the black flag of Islam"". So ethnocentrism clearly exists in Islam, but you are correct that it is not ""on the books"". 

Either way, I don't find it useful to use left-wing and right-wing labels. Imran Khan of Pakistan has publicly committed himself to building an 'Islamic welfare state'.

It’s either one or the other. Inclusion of Albania or Turkey would change whole paradigm. That would destroy Europe’s mythos and chance for common identity in the future.

&gt; What you call European civilization is essentially Mediterranean civilization which flourished in the Bronze Age (long before Christianity).

Sure, Christianity is just a part of the mix, but it’s one of the few main foundations of European civilization. With Christianity all the elements were connected into culture we call European, we went in many different ways since then but Middle Ages formed Europe, we all have roots in Christianity.

757,"&gt; the current government made use of the reserves the previous government collected

Care to cite any sources for this? I'm not advocating in favor or against either government - they are all the same just with different people running it - but your statement makes absolutely no sense, specially considering that the deficit has shrunk to the [lowest level in 45 years](https://www.ft.com/content/0037f404-4fea-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49). If your statement was true then the _current_ government would be increasing the deficit and not the other way around.

&gt; seems like debt to gdp did decrease a bit, which is nice to see, but there is still deficit. 

It reduced considerably, the highest reduction in 20 years, but there's a long way to go. Mind you the debt to GDP ratio was considerably underestimated for a long time due to EU accounting rules that did not include all government-owned enterprises in the public debt sphere. I'm not trying to _excuse_ the debt-happy approach of many years, but a large portion of the debt created on the last crisis was _merely_ an accounting shift. What you (and unfortunately many fail to see) is that the debt reduction has directly affected a large portion of the population, and it is disappointing that many in Europe just look at the numbers and not at the people.

&gt; seems like debt to gdp did decrease a bit, which is nice to see, but there is still deficit. Afaik since 1974 there has not been a single year without deficit, and obviously that's not very sustainable.

I'm no economy expert, but many economies in the world run with continuous deficits and use this mechanism as a way to invest in their economies and create growth - in the EU the Maastricht convergence criteria considers that economies can run a continuous deficit (as long as its controlled). In a fiscal union there's very little margin for maneuver, and (for instance) Germany's economic model of an export-driven economy with low inflation and no deficit **does not** work for everyone.

Interesting enough Germany was the first country to break the Maastricht rules with a deficit over 3%, which just comes to show that there are perfectly valid reasons for running elevated budgets if the current economic growth is not favorable.

&gt; And afaik significant part of the balancing done has been from increasing taxes, which is hardly of any long-term benefit to the economy. When you've already squeezed taxes, maybe it's time to properly cut costs, because in case you haven't noticed there's still deficit!

That's sadly not true and as black-and-white as you (and many) seem to believe. Much of the deficit reduction came from [the lowest public investment in decades](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-portugal-economy-analysis/portugals-economy-an-express-train-at-risk-of-derailing-idUSKCN1Q41RR), which significantly hurts the productivity sector today and its future growth potential. 

This aversion to deficit hurts everyone when it comes at the expense of public investment, and Germany is also facing infrastructure issues (specially in the rail sector) because of its refusal to make public investment, specially when it can get free debt ([FT](https://www.ft.com/content/dad52eb6-7d4d-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560)).

There has never been a better time to use public debt to invest in productivity with interest rates near or at zero, and I'm sure many countries will realize this too late.

&gt; how a country in such a state can even think about using money in non-optimal ways is amazing, sure the climate is important, but you can't help the climate if you're at risk of bankruptcy can you?

Care (again) to cite sources that clarify why Portugal is at the risk of bankruptcy, specially when its growth and finances are in their best shape in 20 years, and even the doomsday experts at the IMF say that [the country has never been in a better state](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2019/03/01/sp030119-portugal-and-the-global-economy-the-way-forward)?

Besides I'd rather see **all** governments spending in green energy and against the climate change doomsday **today** and still guarantee that we all have a inhabitable world in the future, even at the expense of its economic results. Having fiscal responsibility today means nothing if the environment is destructed tomorrow.

&gt; yeah yet there's still deficit, if one day no one lends money or it goes bankrupt then it's back to riding donkeys and growing potatoes in the backyard in order not to starve. 

No offense but that's an ignorant statement. Even with the worst crisis in 40 years Portugal managed to feed its people just fine, and only an apocalyptic war-driven scenario could plunge an advanced economy into the scenario you described. You clearly know very little of Portugal... 

&gt; I hope there's no recession soon, and if there is I hope it won't be enough to cross the line, lest Portugal not survive another 2010-11, when the retarded government grew debt from ~70 to ~110 in record time lmao.

As I stated above, the debt to GDP ratio was a result of EU-wide accounting rules changes ([Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/NIM/?uri=celex:32013L0034)), doubled-down by the economic contraction. The debt was **always** there, just not explicitly associated with the sovereign debt.

784,"&gt;The ""everybody-is-welcome""-parties do not attempt to enshrine their views into the legal framework because they know there would be no permissive consensus for such craziness in the populace of any European country. That is why they persistently call irregular migrants ""refugees"" and want to go on using procedures meant for actual refugees, not irregular migrants.

Well, international law (and EU law) determines the conditions which should be met for someone in order to qualify as a refugee. I'm almost 100% sure that there is no provision for poverty, so what's the point to call them refugees or whatever? As long as international law remains the same they still won't be legally considered refugees, except if these parties could indeed find a way to make countries agree to a new legal frame.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If an irregular migrant from Nigeria arriving at the shores of Europe has a 30 percent chance of ending up in a prison-like detention center in Eastern Europe, spending some years there during legal procedures, or his entire remaining life if he does not help with identification, and in the end being effectively deported, that would certainly serve to chill irregular migration to Europe considerably. 

EU could also try to dissolve smugglers' networks. It would not only help regulate immigration flows to Europe, but would also protect immigrants from atrocities perpetrated by smugglers against them, something which by the way is not as well known as drowning in the Mediterranean.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On deportations, of course you can make that possible if the political will is there. And few people would permanently refuse to help with identification if the alternative is to spend the rest of their life in a prison-like detention center. 

I'm not talking about identification. I'm talking about cooperation from the countries that will take failed asylum seekers back. That's another obstacle and I'm not so sure if the EU has ever addressed it. If the receiving country denies cooperation, then it's unlikely a single country would succeed to change its stance.

I wouldn't be surprised if some of the benefits are left overs from the time the miners were quite powerful in Romania. 

In 1990, the president of Romania (Iliescu, PSD) called on the miners to come to Bucharest and beat up protestors. A bunch of people died. Now iliescu is standing trial for crimes against humanity for that.

In 1999, miners staged huge strikes against the closing of mines in Romania. The started marching towards Bucharest. 1500 gendarmes were taken as hostages. It wasn't something small.

The [proposals](https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf) for 100% renewable use multiple technologies in conjunction across regions. And it checks out. If you build sufficient power lines downtime in say wind power can be offset through other sources (especially Hydro including tidal and thermal). Existing storage technology is sufficient to bridge any gaps that may exist. There are also many [smaller](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513001213?via%3Dihub) [scale](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544214007981?via%3Dihub) [proposals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629614000036?via%3Dihub) so it does not have to be a global project. 

Not to mention that many regions and some nations are already 100% renewable. Some of them directly fly in the face of your idea that renewables couldn´t be deployed in say Germany seeing as Schleswig Holstein not only runs 100% on them but also exports considerable amounts of power. So I should ask you what you actually base these claims on? I am fairly sure it´s nothing but conjecture.

It should of course be noted that while 100% renewable without nuclear is possible abandoning nuclear prematurely will generally increase the cost and potentially slow down such projects.

Sure, the tax money goes to Germany, and as a result, Germany can contribute more to the EU, meaning I need to contribute less. In addition, I get access to the larger market that is Germany by being part of the EU if I want to. Companies from my country can sell more in a larger market and therefore get richer. 

&gt;digital companies like amazon facebook etc make so much money in europe, but they funnel their money through countries like ireland or luxembourg to avoid paying taxes. 

This doesn't seem like an EU problem but more of an international trade problem though doesn't it? Stepping out of the EU won't make tax havens disappear. 

&gt;i agree with you here, however there is something to be said for jobs moving abroad. goods may become cheaper, but that doesn't necessarily mean my countries economy will be better off.

This depends on the industry. Sure, if British companies are off cheaper manufacturering elsewhere than Britain, they will and the UK will loose manufacturing jobs. But this doesn't just apply to the EU, European clothing companies do the same in Bangladesh and China. This is just a result of capitalism, not of the EU. But, if I can get a pick, boost a European market (which I am part og) or boost a non European market, I would prefer boosting the European one.",,/r/europe/comments/ddk24h/britain_paid_150m_a_week_to_europe_not_350m_as/f2jj8p9/,sebastiaandaniel,1570273324

The Asse nuclear waste storage also was experimental. Experiments can fail, though in this case the problem was lack of oversight and we should fix that if we try it again.


General doubts about nuclear safety imply these exist outside of people who don't understand modern reactor designs (i.e. not the shit they used in the Soviet Union). Experts have about as much doubts about nuclear safety as they have doubts about man-made climate change.


Cost is about the only one which could in theory be true, but if you put the costs of the EEG (basically, paying for renewable build-up with a higher energy bill) against the price of nuclear power plants the ""nuclear power is so expensive"" can be doubted.

Why? People keep repeating this as if it's some absolute truth, but I haven't heard a convincing argument why.

Capitalism is a way to direct resources to places where they are most effectively and efficiently used. It is needed for as long as the world is *changing*, not necessarily *growing* in absolute terms. For example, when an existing industry matures and gets more efficient (via, e.g., people simply learning how to do things better), capitalism moves the freed up resources to new industries where they are more needed (and hence have higher return on investment).

&gt; People need to understand that we need a system better than Capitalism before it's too late.

Public transport works in big cities where a subway train, tram or bus leaves every 5-10 minutes as there are so many passengers it remains profitable. You don't need to wait long times between each departure. When the place gets smaller the time between the departures gets longer. Suddenly you might be waiting over 30 minutes between buses and the journey to wherever you're going will start taking a pretty long time. And then you get to a smaller, rural town. All of a sudden you might have just 1 bus in the morning, 1 in the evening. Good luck using public transportation to get anywhere!

Car pools and sharing a vehicle? Again, works in bigger places, not smaller ones.

Walking and cycling? Again, great for bigger places, horrible for smaller ones when services can be really far away.

1122,"&gt; Let us not allow these actions from a few radical individuals blind our balanced judgement of this issue.

Definitely. The Catalan independence movement has always been an example of pacifism, being able to organize demonstrations with 1 million people without any incident. But of course, as everywhere, there will always be some radical individual. 

In the case of the video, the demonstration had ended hours before and the streets were already empty. But sometimes there's a small group of people who don't seem to want to go home, and they stay well into the night as in this case. They are usually the people who want to make more noise. Or those who are capable of throwing a trash can for whatever reasons. But nevertheless, the [Catalan pro-independence leaders](https://twitter.com/gabrielrufian/status/1179128811180441602) were the first to share this video and denounce this behavior. Which is nice of them.

These types of actions do not define a movement. And the same applies to the movement for the unity of Spain, in whose manifestations the same thing has happened as in OP's video. For example, in a demonstration against independence in Barcelona a protester hit the face of a reporter from Catalan public television ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sEKuTEWm2I)). In another pro-Spain unity demonstration in Barcelona, protesters repeatedly hit a cameraman from Madrid's public television, punching him in the head, because the protesters mistakenly thought he was a cameraman from the Catalan public television. The cameraman had to repeat several times that he was from Madrid, so that the protesters would stop hitting him ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg0jTYqazfw)).

Obviously these actions are not representative of the people who support the permanence of Catalonia in Spain, nor are they in the case of those who defend the independence of Catalonia.",EU,/r/europe/comments/dddsfm/spanish_tv_reporter_insulted_pushed_spit_and/f2i4do5/,Xendix,1570252080

1235,"I don't know how they're using ""middle class"", but in the US, ""middle class"" means something decidedly different than management.

But if it is management you want, you can probably get a rough estimate of the maximum practical number.

https://blog.namely.com/blog/best-number-of-direct-reports

&gt; We found that managers, on average, have nine direct reports.  Our data appears to corroborate other studies on the subject, with a recent Deloitte survey noting that U.S. managers averaged 9.7 direct reports. At large enterprises, that number increased to 11.4.

So figure 9 direct reports for each manager.  That means that each non-managing worker has has ~11.11...% total management overhead in terms of manpower.

https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-labor-force-smaller-retirement/29390762.html

&gt; Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) reported in early 2018 that Russia’s working population is 82.3 million people. Such numbers were last reported in 1979. The country’s working population peaked in 2006, at 90.16 million people.

So you figure that as a back-of-the-envelope calculation, you'd expect to have maybe 9.14 million people managing.  That's *about* in-line with the number they have.

That being said, I cannot imagine that they're simply using it as a synonym for ""management"", given:

&gt;Members of the middle class risk losing this status if they have children or retire, according to the reported study presented at the university’s conference with French colleagues Thursday.

But along with electrification there is a simultaneous revolution going on in the auto industry which is autonomous driving. Most cars are used less than 5% of the time (the rest of the time staying parked at home or at a place of work etc). With autonomous driving it becomes possible to greatly increase the use of cars up to (nearly) 100% because they can drive around transporting people as robo taxis (either put to use in this capacity when the owner is not using them or owned as fleets). Thus with autonomous driving electric vehicles we will only need to replace a percentage of the current global population of cars.

(Also, on a smaller note, EVs are much less complex vehicles and thus easier to mass produce. So we should be able to ramp up production fairly rapidly, *except* for the bottleneck that is battery production).",,/r/europe/comments/dda9qs/denmark_calls_for_eu_ban_on_all_diesel_and_petrol/f2hrwaz/,thecoldisyourfriend,1570247423

We'll see. Financial compensation goes a long way to assuaging the desire for exclusive use. And unlike with rental cars, you won't be putting your car out to be driven (badly) by other users; merely allowing them to sit in it while they are transported somewhere.

BTW, the points I made above are drawn from an in-depth report called ""Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030: The Disruption of Transportation and the Collapse of the Internal-Combustion Vehicle and Oil Industries"". Quoting the first paragraph of the executive summary:

&gt; We are on the cusp of one of the fastest, deepest, most consequential disruptions of transportation in history. By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles (AVs), 95% of U.S.  passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new business model we call “transport-as-a-service” (TaaS). The TaaS disruption will have enormous implications across the transportation and oil industries, decimating entire portions of their value chains, causing oil demand and prices to plummet, and destroying trillions of dollars in investor value — but also creating trillions of dollars in new business opportunities, consumer surplus and GDP growth.

Romania is one of the few countries in the world that has an embassy in North Korea. Thanks to EU laws, they have to assist you like they would assist a Romanian stuck in NK. Maybe you won't travel to NK, but you should know that all of the middle east is very appreciative of Romania, they know about it and have a positive reaction when you mention you're Romanian.

How so the UK will no doubt be using that time to reach trade agreements out side the EU to offset the impact of brexit, something the EU will struggle to do as we saw with the mercosur deal. Every deal it signs strengthens its position by reducing its dependence on EU trade.

Politically the UK goverment won't find it difficult to keep the UK side of the border open, while Ireland will find its self trying to negotiate a way to keep its side of the border open with the EU.

The withdrawal agreement without the backstop gets the EU the divorce bill, citizens rights, and a transition period to negotiate a trade agreement which realistically is the only long term solution to the border issues.

Without the backstop there is the possibility that those talks will fail and the UK will leave with no-deal any way in afew years all though the EU then gets to keep the divorce bill.

If Europe was auto-sufficient in the coal it uses, pollution would be saved by not having to import it, and at that point production can just be reduced in function of the decrease of its use.

1360,"&gt; The people do not need to vote for a constitution, if that was a neccessity, germany and many other countries would've never had a constitution.  

That's not the point, the point being that what we have now was always intended as a temporary framework, to be replaced by one *the people* actually get to vote on, and not *the parties.*   


Because in reality those ""elected and independent representatives"" are nothing but a meme, everybody votes by party lines, representatives act by party lines, even tho that also shouldn't happen.  


&gt; Even though it has a different name (in which it is not the only one, the dutch constitution is also called basic law) it is a constitution both de jure and de facto.  

This isn't an issue about terminology, it's about the reality that it wasn't intended as a permanent constitution.  
When it was created certain admissions had to be made to the allies, like granting them special surveillance privileges.  


That happened on the understanding that it would only be **temporary**, and not to legalize NSA spying in Germany for all eternity.   


&gt; Article 146 doesn't say the Grundgesetz should or must be replaced by a constitution decided by the people at any point in time, but that it can be. 

Dude, read [the original text](https://lexetius.com/GG/146,2) and the intention is very clear: It's signaling that this GG was not decided on by the German people and most certainly not in ""freier Entscheidung"".   


&gt; And really, there is absolutely no reason to replace the Grundgesetz, it is one of the best constitutions in the world.

1496,"WTF? I'm not condoning mgm. It's horrible and it should be stopped. However, it's true that the vast majority of circumcised men go on to have normal sex lives and hardly ever have serious health issues related to circumcision. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT AN ABHORRENT PRACTICE THAT NEEDS TO STOP.

The ""severest"" form of fgm does not just include the removal of the clitoris, it also includes the removal of the labia minora and the labia majora get sewn together with a straw in between so pee and menstrual blood can pass through it. There are three types of fgm: type I is usually the removal of the clitoris, and in a minority of cases only the clitorial hood (a very small percentage, and even then in most cases the clitoris is too sensitive to be stimulted directly so you need the clitorial hood). Type II is the removal of the clitoris + labia minora. Type III, the severest, I described before. Type IV include a variety of other harmful practices such as the nicking of the clitoris, burning off the genitals, labia stretching, excision of the hymen and gishiri cutting (cutting the vagina's front or back wall with a blade, which tends to cause urine to seep into the vagina). Type IV is usually found in differentiated African tribes. In all of these cases, women are unable to reach orgasm during intercourse, are at an incredibly high risk of suffering from infections (constant infections, not just the one from the procedure) and problems related to the urinary system and fertility. Cysts tend to form that can also become infected, urine (and even faeces in the worst cases) can seep into the vagina and provoke even more severe infections and incontinence. FGM can also cause intensely painful periods and other fertility complications, from putting women and their children at a higher risk of death during childbirth and pregnancy, and tend to suffer more from tearing and anal-sphincter damage. And that is not even mentioning the high risk of bleeding to death during the procedure or due to infections shortly after.

Both are horrifying and should not be practiced by anyone, but if you honestly think male circumcision is the same as fgm, you're an idiot.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/dd35jk/jews_and_muslims_in_sweden_outraged_over_call_to/f2gih3y/,Elissa_of_Carthage,1570231032

I have a slightly different proposal for you. How would you feel about a Pan-European climate fund for these sorts of changes, so not each country has to be doing things alone? Germany is already quite advanced, as is France, as is Sweden. So why not have Europeans help each other, which might mean German or French or Swedish Euros* go to Poland and Czechia because a higher reduction in emissions per Euro spent can be achieved in countries that have further to go? 

I'd 100% be thrilled about my tax funds going into that sort of thing, even if it's infrastructure I never see. We're all in this together and the more we can understand that spending money now is much cheaper than losing the environment later, the better.

They work there because they live in poor countries and are desperate for a job. America is a rich country with a thriving aerospace sector with high wages. People choose to work for SpaceX, it's highly competitive getting in, they could easily choose more money and better conditions working for another company.

&gt;Which industries is he threatening?

Aerospace, telecoms, cars.

&gt;Also, why don't you ""colonise Mars"" by working French hours?

Because it's really really hard. The French have a boring, old-school rocket which does an old job reliably (when they don't launch it in the wrong direction). That ain't getting you to Mars. The reason Europe doesn't have a manned space program is because you don't get two hours for your lunch in the middle of a spacewalk.

&gt;Why do you need ""fully re-usable rockets"" to ""colonise the solar system""?

Because otherwise it'll be way too slow an expensive. You need to shift some serious hardware and a lot of people. A rocket that launches 10 tonnes then falls in the sea doesn't cut the mustard, that's why they're developing a rocket that launches 150 tonnes, can land again, be refuelled and launch another 150 tonnes.

There's a difference in mentality. Arianespace is a jobs program, SpaceX was started to accomplish a goal.

&gt;And why do you think the Ariane 6 is ""obsolete""?

Because it's non-reusable, expensive, and has a low lift capability.  

&gt;It makes a lot of sense, I certainly would not want my country to have to rely on American corporations either.

1709,"Most European societies don't want children to drink. To enforce this, if a child tries to buy alcohol he is denied. 

That doesn't necessarily stop children from drinking alcohol; a child can still get alcohol by asking an adult or some other way. *But it significantly reduces the amount of alcohol consumption by children.* 

If an adult wants to buy and consume alcohol, and accepts all negative effects that come with it, that's his own decision. If an adult asks a teenager if he wants to try a beer and let's the teenager decide, that isn't necessarily illegal. If an adult is forcing a five year old to drink a shotglass of Vodka, we can all agree that's bad (and illegal). 

But your analogy isn't comparable with circumcision to start with, using analogies never really works. But to answer your question: alcohol is already (indirectly) banned for children. It doesn't really matter if the child is buying wine for a religious/traditional event; the store won't sell it.

&gt;Alcohol is way way way worse than circumcision.

Medically, yes. But it's **adults** that **decide themselves** if they think drinking is worth the medical negative effects. The adult has control over what happens with his body. 

A child being circumcised is not in a comparable position. It's a **child** that **did not decided himself** if he wants to undergo a cosmetic operation. The child has no control over what happens with his body. 

&gt;By your logic, banning alcohol will make drinkers realise drinking isn't cool and they'll stop.

&gt;Right?

Laws are a reflection of the society one lives in. Values are codified and enforced. But law also has an effect on the values of the people living in said system. 

Some out-of-date values are still in place because the justice system is still enforcing them. 

Again, alcohol is not really comparable to circumcision. The subjects aren't similar enough.

&gt;But if for the Jews and Muslims it's okay, then nothing will change. All the laws in the world won't change that.

Why not? Laws are meant to influence how people behave. Making something against the law WILL influence how people behave.

1728,"&gt; 3 Right winged parties quarelled and lost power - what is there to explain?

It shows that 2015 wasn't some sort of censure date when pluralism became reality, because in reality PiS is as mainstream of a party as it gets - it just sucks at running the media despite the entire state helping them have some.

&gt; Both in 2005 and in 2015 media were on liberal side.

TVP was run by conservatives, including former presidential advisor and a nationalist, until 2011. Not to mention the coalition broke down over PiS trying to fuck over minor parties with corruption charges and hoping to take over their electorate.

&gt; There was no possibility of this coalition to survive under constant barrage of criticism from all sides.

I'm pretty sure putting prominent Self-Defense politicians in jail had absolutely nothing to do with it. Nada.

&gt; Now we have some sort of equality (TVP, WPROST, SIECI PRAWDY, TRWAM - on one side and TVN, NEWSWEEK, POLITYKA, RMF -FM - on the other).

That's not equality - that's just building a bunch of media bubbles with taxpayers' money. If you wanted equality, you would make TVP as impartial as it gets and work on private media that are biased towards your side. But it was never about equality, but about easy money.

(not to mention Polsat is conservative now thanks to Gawryluk and Rymanowski, but conservatives need to be told when they're pandered to)

&gt; PiS has the advantage of public funds

True. Conservatives have been given 'Express Wieczorny' for free from Commie party property - they had to sell it to the Swiss three years later due to low sales. Conservatives have spent public money from various state companies to launch an alternative TV station to liberal TVN and populist Polsat - it stopped broadcasting two years later due to financial problems. They have taken over state broadcasting time and time again, almost always leading to a fall in audience. They have been funding their private media as well, but those sell really poorly, with up to 75% of printed copies of their only daily (Gazeta Polska Codziennie) ending up unsold.

&gt; opposition has the advantage of support from liberal EU elites

No, at least on media level. When libs do media, they do media first and politics second. People don't tune in to see their favourite talking heads lambasting the other side - they tune in to watch Big Brother (TVN's biggest hit that made it a major TV station), cabarets, movies.  Sure, they're biased as well, but it's not propaganda that makes people bleed from their eyes and ears - after all, they don't need to be funded by politicians to stay afloat.

&gt; Now everyone have their media and parties fight on equal (mostly) footing. This is the first time we have actual choice from times immemorial.

1885,"Probably. 

But that vocal minority will always be unhappy, so will do mental gymnastics to justify their insecurities regardless of the outcome.

The UK (and many other nations) are going through stagnation and dissatisfaction at the moment, unsatisfyingly the best way to pacify those people is to actually make a society that works for the people, raising their living standards overtime instead of lowering them and using the EU as a scapegoat like previous governments have done over the generations.

That's why a referendum with as much legitimacy should be the method. Those people will cry bloody murder but when the dust is settled it will become clear those vocal few are more interested in division than anything else. I'm a Labour supporter and think our party's policy of a referendum with a legitimate leave option, (while allowing MP's to support whichever side they choose while the party officially remains neutral) is the best option for achieving this.

 [https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/indicator-greenhouse-gas-emissions#textpart-1](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/indicator-greenhouse-gas-emissions#textpart-1) 

Notice how the energy industry created \~430 million tonnes of CO2 in 1990 and a predicted \~300 in 2018, which means only a reduction of about 30%. (Yes i know these are from different years, but going from 30% to 47% is very much improbable)

Also it clearly shows how electricity is only part of the problem, transportation has seen no substantial reduction in CO2 emissions.

2246,"**Traditional Slovenian Food: exquisite cuisine**

The truth is that traditional Slovenian food is quite unknown and that is also a reason why I’ve decided to present it in this post. Via this guide to Slovenian gastronomy, I will help you get to know the rich culinary heritage and give you some ideas about what to eat in Slovenia or Ljubljana.

It is so amazing that such a small country like Slovenia offers various food (over 170 distinguishable dishes) depending on climate, history, traditions, also villages and towns. Each region has its own specific culinary tradition rooting back to historic time. Additionally, Slovenian cuisine is under significant influence of the neighboring countries’ food from Austria, Balkan countries, Italy and Hungary.

Therefore, you will find Slovenian food specialties from:

Austria cuisine: Slovenian sausage (“klobasa“), Wiener Schnitzel (“dunajski zrezek“) and strudel (“štrudelj” – a pastry with a filling of apples/sour cherry/cabbage,…).
Italian cuisine: all kind of dishes made from pasta, gnocchi (small, and soft dough dumplings), pizza, rižota (risotto), žlikrofi (similar to ravioli – small cases of pasta filled with meat or cheese), minestrone (“mineštra” – a thick soup made with vegetables, also meat, sometimes with pasta or rice).
Hungarian cuisine: goulash (“golaž” – a stew made with meat, onion and paprika), paprikas (chicken or beef stew), pancakes (filled with jam, nuts or chocolate).
Balkan cuisine: burek (a pie made of beef/cottage cheese/spinach), čevapčiči (small grilled minced meat served with onions, flatbread and ajvar – red pepper spread), pljeskavica (spicy meat patties), ražnjiči (shish kebab).

Some basics used in Slovenian gastronomy are dairy products, mushrooms, sausages, meat (mainly pork), seafood, incorporating seasonal fruits and vegetables, potatoes, beans, grapes, honey, herbs and olives.

What is very common/appropriate to do here before starting your meal is “Dober tek” (“Bon appétit”), and the answer to that is “Hvala enako” (“Thank you, the same to you”), also “Na zdravje” (“Cheers”).

Slovenian Breakfast
The old traditional Slovenian breakfast consists of fresh bread, a cup of milk, butter, honey an apples. This type of breakfast is not common now anymore. For breakfast, we eat homemade marmalade, also eggs, meat products, cheese, and cereals. We drink natural juice, milk, tea, coffee or cacao.

Bread plays a special role is Slovenian cuisine. There is a wide variety of bread, made of grain wheat flour, rye, corn, buckwheat, spelt, oat, also a mixture of two or more kinds of flour. Moreover, many times it is added also various seeds, even onions, olives or walnuts. It is eaten with every meal.

Lunch
Traditionally, most Slovenian meals start with soup and are eaten all year round. You can find an endless variety of soups – mushroom soup, chicken soup, barley soup, “jota”  (soup with sauerkraut/turnip, beans, potatoes and smoked pork or sausage), bean soup, mix-vegetable soup but the most common is beef broth with noodles. What’s more, beef soup is also a common starter on Sundays in many Slovenian families. Beef soup is a clear, full-flavored broth with either noodles or dumplings and a sprinkle of parsley.

“Mineštra” (minestrone) or stew are also very typical and a favorite Slovenian dish, many times cooked with pork bones, ribs, sausage or another type of meat.

The main dish often includes meat. A favorite side dish is roasted potatoes (“pražen krompir“), but also rice or “štruklji” (boiled/baked dough rolls containing various fillings). The interesting thing about “štruklji” is that they can be served as a dessert as well. A salad is also an important part of lunch with pumpkin seed or olive oil as a dressing. In early springtime is highly appreciated a dandelion (wild lettuce) salad. Also, other vegetables are used in various ways. Very common is cabbage, used as sauerkraut (many times accompanied by sausage and/or roasted potatoes), sweet-and-sour cabbage, and raw cabbage salad.

Bread is often served on the side.

Slovenes are big fans of fish and seafood. A trout (“postrv”) is a fish from the Soča river and is prepared in a variety of ways (traditionally rolled in buckwheat or cornflour and fried). Fish is usually accompanied by boiled potatoes and chard.

Slovenian Desserts
When it comes to Slovenian desserts, there are several:

Potica is a national dessert, yeast-dough roll cake with a variety of filling options (tarragon, walnut, crackling and poppy seeds). Potica is a typical Slovenian easter food. It is also common to put it on Slovenian tables at Christmas and other holidays.
Štrudelj or Zavitek (strudel filled with apples, blueberries, cherries, cottage cheese);
Blejska kremna rezina or Kremšnita (Bled cream cake is a dessert from the town of Bled – a layer of vanilla custard topped with whipped cream and sandwiched between layers of flaky pastry );
Prekmurska gibanica is a pastry filled with poppy seeds, walnuts, apples and cottage cheese and topped with cream;
Cmoki is boiled potato-dough dumplings filled with plums;
Krof or Slovenian fried dough is fluffy round fried dough bun filled with apricot jam, traditionally made for carnival time.
Miške, buhtelni, flancati, pince, šarklji are other types of desserts usually made of fine yeast dough with many eggs yolks, butter and milk.

Other Slovenian specialties
Kranjska klobasa (Carniolan sausage) is a famous Slovenian specialty, usually served with mustard, ketchup and a slice of bread. It is a “Protected Slovene product“;
Kraški pršut is an air-cured ham from the Karst region, made in an old traditional way. It goes perfectly with a glass of red wine;
Indrijski žlikrofi are small boiled dumplings filled with potatoes, onions, and lards or smoked bacon, herbs and spices. Žlikrofi is accompanied by the typical meat sauce;
Krvavica or Blood sausage is stuffed with beef or pork blood;
Ajdovi žganci is made with buckwheat flour and water. It can be served with cracklings, milk or with sauerkraut and grilled sausages on the side;
Bujta repa is a popular winter dish. It’s a type of thick pork soup prepared by mixing pork ingredients in a large pot and slowly stewing it. It is served as a main dish – hot pot.
Seafood is mainly popular along the coast of Slovenia.
Pumpkin seed oil is so delicious and healthy. It is mostly used as a salad dressing.

Many Slovenian towns and cities host culinary and social events, but the last couple of years is popular a unique culinary street food event called “Odprta Kuhna” (the Open Kitchen). The feature of this event is you can experience freshly cooked food prepared by Slovenian chefs right in front of you. Apart from delicious food, it’s a place of good live music and entertainment. My husband and I love this event and always find something for our taste – from Slovenian dishes to international and exotic dishes. I personally love a various choice of food there, but mostly vegan. Yummy!

Beverage
Among friends, it is common to hear “gremo na pijačo” (let’s go for a drink).

Many times you can find on Slovenian tables local mineral water but without a good wine is not a good meal. Very common is “špricer“, half wine and half mineral water. We have three wine-growing regions in Slovenia and are very proud of high-quality wines (sorry, I cannot recommend any since I don’t drink alcohol :)). Beer is also popular with national brands Laško and Union.

In winter Slovenians like drinking “kuhano vino” or “mulled wine”, traditionally made of red or white wine with spices. There is also a Slovene brandy called “žganje” or “šnopc“.

After lunch or in the afternoon with our friends or family, we usually enjoy drinking Turkish coffee. Coffee with milk or whipped cream is also commonly available.

Vegan food in Ljubljana
As you could assume so far, Slovenian cuisine tends to be meat-dominated (or at least using meat products ingredients) but it does not mean that all vegans out there “draw the short straw”. The same like there’s a tendency of vegan options in the world, I believe that Slovenia is progressing when it comes to offering non-meat dishes as well. There are some restaurants, cafe bars or at least menus that offer vegan food in Ljubljana. The good news is that even some traditional Slovenian food and desserts are now available in veganized version. Hooray!

What’s more, many cities in Slovenia have markets where you can find a good selection of local, fresh and good quality fruits and vegetables. I like the colorful open-air central market in Ljubljana that is a must to visit. This place offers mostly organic vegetables, fruits, herbs, and some other products. The choice is really huge – from five types of radicchio, various varieties of apples, cherries, etc.",Kranj (Slovenia),/r/europe/comments/dd3wlp/traditional_slovenian_food_exquisite_cuisine/f2e06mk/,SlovenianCat,1570173018

**Some staples in traditional Slovenian food**

Honey: Beekeeping is one of the oldest traditional crafts in Slovenia. There is a relatively rich selection of different honey (flower, forest, acacia and other types of honey). Slovenian honey is a high-quality and also important ingredient in Slovenian gastronomy. Not only it is used in desserts but also in special dishes or made honey brandy or liqueur.

Cheeses and sour-cream: There is a long cheese-making tradition in Slovenia. A lot of dishes include various cheeses (made from the milk of cows, sheep, goats) but also common cottage cheese. One of the most common is Tolminc (is a hard full fat cheese made of cow’s milk) and Bovčji sir (made from sheep’s milk with intense aroma).

Mushrooms: In season (late summer and autumn) Slovenes love putting some mushrooms on the table which we pick in the nearest woodland. Mushrooms are made in soups, served grill or in risotto.

Forest fruits: Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries are common parts of Slovenian desserts, cakes, pies, strudels. They are used to make jams or eaten fresh.

Chestnuts: No autumn is perfect without chestnuts. I personally love them, whether roasted or cooked. Boiled chestnuts are used for making puree or as an ingredient in cakes, ice-cream or other dishes. We love eating hot chestnuts also to heat up our hands in cold autumn days. It’s a true autumn ritual gathering in the circle of a family at home or in street stalls.

**Eating habits in Slovenia**

We typically eat three meals a day, from which lunch is the most important.
Around 10:00 a.m. we take a break and have a snack.
Lunch is served from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
Soup (most commonly beef soup) is the most popular starter (on Sundays is a must).
We eat the main dish at the same time as the salad.
Meals are usually large, caloric and hard to digest (based on animal fat, eggs, flour-based dishes, butter, cream, potatoes).
We don’t have typical food for dinner. Usually, dinner is smaller than lunch (leftover from lunch, yogurt, cheese and salami with bread,…).
Traditional spices of Slovenian cuisine is parsley, marjoram, mint, melissa, sage, thyme, savory, bay leaf, pepper and cinnamon.

**Where can you try traditional Slovenian dishes?**

Local dishes are basically found everywhere in Slovenia but mostly in “gostilna” (a simple restaurant that serves traditional Slovenian food), tourist farms, resorts and hotels. There is also common to find in “osmica“. The word means “eight” and is referred on a period of eight days when farmers offer their homemade produce at their homes. You can also explore the dishes at various culinary events in Slovenia.

Dishes can be sometimes expensive, but you have also an option for more economic cooked foods at local supermarkets.",Kranj (Slovenia),/r/europe/comments/dd3wlp/traditional_slovenian_food_exquisite_cuisine/f2e07k2/,SlovenianCat,1570173059

1 million people signed a petition in the East that protested against a takeover (a “selling out of moral and material goods”) by the West, although many millions more voted for parties who wanted a fast track to integration in the first fair elections.

2328,"Oh boy.

First things first. Before you start packing you need to do a lot of research on each of those countries. Germany and Poland are part of the EU. Switzerland is not part of the EU but they take part in the free market. That being said each country may have different procedures in terms of documents needed for relocation in case of studies or otherwise. But as far as I know with a US passport you don't need a visa to visit.

But being a tourist is not the same as moving. Moving often requires you to prove you have a job waiting (in which case you may need a work permit), are studying, or have enough money to support yourself for at least a year. So check that out for each country you are considering. 

Yould should also understand that it's expected you learn the language, so I'd suggest you look into that and see if you can see yourself learning any of these, because they are different.

As you are 19 you could look into university options. See what you need, if there is a tuition fee etc.

Culturarly, and politically each country is different. Even neighbhouring countries are different, so I'd wager a culture shock will happen regardless. But it does not have to be bad. It will be a bit of a cold shower in the beggining but if you go with the flow you'll find your own conceptions change with time.

One time after a revolt, an Ottoman emperor even executed a Saudi revolter but not before forcing him to listen to music before his death because they think listening to music is sinful or some weird shit like that. Even back then Ottomans (who are also muslims just like Saudis) had to deal with their backwards asses and years later the whole world still has to deal with their backward asses.

Muslim terrorists have killed other Muslims far much than Christians. Why do you think that is? I'll give you a hint, it's not because all Muslims around the world follow the same branch of Islam. 

Islam might be a despicable ideology at this modern day and age but Westerners love supporting the worst branches of it for some reason despite ideologically being the opposites of them. It's been happening since Cold War.

I know it's not possible for anyone to stand up to Saudi Arabia because of realpolitik about oil and trade (and in Cold War's case it was to counter communist revolutionaries with reactionary rebels) but no need to make up excuses like ""lol all muslims are evil anyway"" Nobody looks at Westboro Baptists and says ""we need to embargo Luxembourg cuz they are evil Christians""",big bad turk,/r/europe/comments/dcqh2v/paris_police_attack_four_killed_by_knifewielding/f2dwndi/,Elatra,1570168138

2450,"About 1.5 million farms in the EU manage fruit orchards (including nut orchards) that covered 3.4 million hectares in 2017. A further 2.2 million hectares of fresh vegetables were cultivated in the EU in 2017 by about 0.8 million farms.

Spain had the largest fruit production area in the EU; the 1.4 million hectares accounted for two-fifths (40.1%) of the EU total. Italy had the largest production area of vegetables; the 0.4 million hectares accounted for 17.8% of the EU total.

Almonds mostly grown in Spain. Largest area of apple orchards in Poland.

Almond orchards across the EU covered 743 000 hectares in 2017 (22.5% of the total EU fruit area). Apple orchards covered 522 000 hectares (15.5% of the total EU fruit area), the second largest fruit area in the EU by species.

Spain accounted for the largest area of almond orchards (85.2% of the EU total).

Nearly one-third of the EU's apple orchards were in Poland (31.1%). This was a similar area to that of the next three Member States combined: Italy (11.0%), Romania (10.6%) and France (9.6%).

A majority of the EU’s cultivated tomato area in Italy and Spain.

Tomatoes were cultivated on 241 000 hectares across the EU in 2017 (equivalent to 10.8% of the total fresh vegetables area cultivated). The second most widely cultivated vegetable was onions, which was farmed on 181 000 hectares (or 8.1% of the total vegetable area).

Italy cultivated the largest area of tomatoes in the EU (38.4% of the EU total), followed by Spain (25.2%), Romania (9.2%) and Portugal (8.7%). The Netherlands (19.0%) accounted for nearly one-fifth (19.0%) of the EU's total onion area, followed by Poland (14.7% and Spain (14.1%).",,/r/europe/comments/dd22gt/spain_had_the_largest_fruit_production_area_in/f2dpyx6/,Vorbitor,1570161048

we don't need a replacement. We need you gone. No ifs, no buts. 

&gt; will it be a country with a nuclear deterrent

Lol, you know that you are not the only country in Europe with nuclear weapons? France has them too, and unlike the UK, it's not a lap dog to the US diplomatically and militarily. [In fact, the UK doesn't even have an independent nuclear deterrent programme](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-trident-nuclear-program/). 

&gt; and a large deficit in trade and contributions?

lol, the EU budget for the years 2021 - 2027 has already been drafted without accounting for the UK budget and contributions of net contributors will not rise significantly 


&gt; 	Britain was of course a big net-contributor. Its exit seriously diminishes the EU’s spending power. But as the EU27 grows it will fill part of the gap, so it can carry on what it does today without increasing what member states contribute, at least relative to the size of their economies.
&gt; 
&gt; The EU27 can cope with the Brexit shortfall, in other words, without budget payments exceeding 1 per cent of gross national income. That is important because it has long been the most symbolic baseline for net contributors, such as Germany, the Netherlands, France, Sweden and Austria.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Doubters should take a look at this excellent Bruegel paper from Zsolt Darvas and Guntram Wolff. Their model assumes that GNI for the EU27 will be 28.1 per cent higher in 2021-27 than in 2014-20 because of inflation and growth. That would allow the union to keep its budget at 1 per cent of GNI, protect all its existing programmes in real terms, and still have a little money to spare.
&gt;

Anyway, while I disagree in some regards how the sub develops, can you remove the ""low effort"" category when removing posts?

It's basically only used for memes. I can take a pic with my smartphone of the gutter on my way to Uni and flair it OC and it's technically allowed even though it's low effort.

Also, this is the least useful and least specific feedback you could have, but I liked the sub more 2 years ago, even though there were more rampant nazis. I think it's mostly the content that was banned. I liked /u/loulan posting pics of Alsace every week (even though that's allowed now) but I think the current rules still make it so that the weekends are flooded with shitty pictures while the weekdays are just news. If you'd 100% adhere by the rules you'd never post in r/europe anyway because there technically is a sub where you should post instead anyway, like /r/europics, /r/EuropeanCulture  ( and weren't there affiliated subreddits like europolitics, euronews?). Nowadays it's mostly a news aggregate with some /r/MapPorn crossposts and on weekends the picture flood.

Furthermore, I think allowing memes would be beneficial. Yes, the first month or so it would probably get flooded, but over time it would peter out. I don't even think it would hurt /r/YUROP (STRONK!) as basically only pro EU and pro federalism memes are upvoted there (not that it bothers me a lot, I agree with both), but there are Europeans who don't necessarily want to federalise and still share memes about their recent culture and it is very arbitrary when a meme is allowed here and when it isn't. 2 Years ago mods were more lenient and I found myself more on r/europe. 

Yes, part of it was the novelty but while the moderation quality has increased in these years, I find myself coming here less often, I go more to /r/AskEurope and I find that sad, as r/europe is (or was) one of the best subreddits on reddit, not in small part because of the moderation team.

NUTS 3 regions are not by definition a metropolitan area. They are generally based on existing national administrative subdivisions.  In Sweden NUT 3 regions are counties (län), in Denmark it's provinces (landsdele). Again you see the difference between the countries and the arbitrary way of doing subdivisions. The capital region in Denmark is split into three NUTS3 codes.

I am not so sure about that. If you look at the US´s balance sheets, their debt is way too high for their economy size. There are only a couple of major factors, that keep them in the ""positive"".

1. World reserve currency
2. Oil trade is done in US currency
3. A lot of money flows into their country for it to be SAFELY invested

These are obvoisly not all, but a few major ones.

If one or several of these go away, the US might just collapse under the pressure of their own debt. If they engage into a trade war with everyone, I am sure one of these will fall eventually.

2802,"*FRACKING has been banned in Scotland because it is “incompatible” with tackling the climate change emergency, the SNP Government has confirmed.*

(My Note: Keep reading. Misleading title.)

After six years of deliberations, energy minister Paul Wheelhouse said the government had decided to refuse to grant any licences for the controversial gas extraction technique.

He said this “strong policy” position and embedding opposition to fracking in the next National Planning Framework due in 2021 meant a legislative ban was unnecessary.

However he told MSPs that a ban in law may become preferable in future.

The move, which was revealed in a government website leak yesterday, was widely welcomed at Holyrood, although there remain calls for a “water-tight legislative ban”.

Mr Wheelhouse said the position of “no support” for fracking followed “a comprehensive period of evidence-gathering and consultation” that started in 2013.

*He said the final position of refusing to issue licences meant no fracking would take place, extending a moratorium that has already been in effect since 2015.*

There would also be a ban on the burning of coal bed methane.

The chief planner today told councils of the new planning position to put it ""into immediate effect"".

Mr Wheelhouse said: “The Scottish Government’s final policy position is that we do not support the development of unconventional oil and gas - often known as fracking - in Scotland.

&gt;“That decision followed consideration of many factors including the significant negative effects that UOG development could have on our natural environment and the health and wellbeing of communities, while bearing in mind the overwhelming feedback from the public that this should not be permitted in Scotland.

&gt;“After a comprehensive evidence-gathering exercise, we have concluded that the development of onshore unconventional oil and gas is incompatible with our policies on climate change, energy transition and the decarbonisation of our economy.

&gt;“Fracking can only happen if licences are issued and we do not intend to issue any licences which would permit that.”

*Critics say fracking, which involves pumping pressurised water and chemicals into underground shale beds to release natural gas, is a risk to climate change and public health. 

Advocates say it could support hundreds of new jobs and add millions to the economy.*

Ineos, which currently imports US shale gas to Grangemouth to use as a chemical industry feedstock, has long expressed an interest in fracking in the Central Belt.

Although Mr Wheelhouse did not mention Ineos by name, he acknowledged the Scottish chemical industry disagreed with his decision and sought to reassure manufacturers.

&gt;He said: “Scotland’s chemicals industry has conveyed strong views on the potential benefits of unconventional oil and gas for Scottish industry. 

&gt;“While we do not share this vision, I want to be clear our support for Scotland’s industrial base and our desire to develop our world-class chemical manufacturing sector is unwavering. 

&gt;“We will continue to support the sector in a range of ways in the months and years to come but we do not agree that Unconventional Oil and Gas extraction is a requirement of the industry’s future.”

&gt;&gt;Green MSP Mark Russell said: “We’ve pushed the Scottish Government all the way on this issue, ever since we led the first debate on the subject in 2012, and have worked with communities across the country to highlight the major public health and environmental concerns that fracking presented.

&gt;""This decision emphasises that Greens continue to punch above our weight, and is just the latest example of Green MSPs leading the change in the Scottish Parliament.

&gt;“Now the moratorium on planning decisions has been lifted, ministers must move to reject Ineos’s application to exploit gas in the Forth Valley.

&gt;""Communities have lived under the shadow of a Coal Bed Methane development since 2012 and in some cases residents have even struggled to sell their houses.

&gt;""The final nail in the coffin for fracking in Scotland would be a speedy rejection of this development bringing years of uncertainty to an end.”

&gt;&gt;Friends of the Earth Scotland Head of Campaigns Mary Church said: ""It is of course very welcome that Ministers have announced they are keeping the indefinite moratorium on fracking in place, but frustrating that today's decision falls short of the full legal ban that would put the issue to bed once and for all.

&gt;*“The inclusion of the policy of no support for fracking in the National Planning Framework would certainly strengthen the present position, but the Energy Minister acknowledged that he can't confirm this will happen before the next Holyrood elections, which could see a new Government with a different approach to fracking in power.""*

&gt;“Clearly the Government haven’t gone as far as they should have, but the fact that there has been no fracking in Scotland for the last five years is a huge victory for campaigners and communities across Scotland."" 

My note: Basically they 'banned' the continuation of fracking for this governments period of control. The next government has no obligation to follow that.",,/r/europe/comments/dcv6gi/fracking_banned_in_scotland_with_immediate_effect/f2bo7r2/,Fireplay5,1570128903

2868,"Hmm that’s a lot to unpack.

Okay so I think we’re pretty much on the same page, we can agree that the trends are not voluntary, but baked into the current socio-economic model. 

You rightfully mention that hubs with highly educated and productive people produce high levels of GDP, and attract others, becoming self-sustaining economic machines. But the same technological trends that drive this also allow for work to be outsourced to lower cost jurisdictions, which tend to be rural. 

And there’s the rub. Rural depopulation isn’t inevitable. There is an economic equilibrium mechanism wherein urban areas become too cost prohibitive for locating lower end manufacturing or services, as well as rising real estate prices that push people out to suburbs, or more rural areas. At some point economic reality makes it more cost effective to locate a factory, or a housing development in a rural area compared to an urban one.

But another thing we can agree on, it depends on how you classify “rural” vs “urban”, and account for the fact that as it gets more developed, a “rural” area tends to become “urban”. After all, mankind’s history is one long drive towards urbanization.

2878,"&gt; First of all, this has nothing to do with Trump. This finding dates back to 2004.

It has to do with  Trump in the sense that Europe can't expect the problem to be solved amicably. I'm not saying that's necessarily what France would have done if Clinton was president but it is possible. Generally over the years Europe and America have reduced the tariffs and barriers against each other in the midst of lots of suits and negotiations.     


&gt; But, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot reject a WTO ruling against you, while at the same time demanding that the WTO levy penalties in your favor.    

Well yes you can. That's what's happening. How would it be fair if  both France and the US subsidised their air industry but only the US could legally put tariffs? It wouldn't be fair.   

&gt;As I recall, the only illegal subsidy found by the WTO was a State of Washington tax credit of $100 million per year.    

I'm think  that's about another case of subsidies. This is about a future expected WTO ruling, not a past one.    At any rate what I don't get is how is the US' ""Buy American"" policy legal? The US government prefers US planes and military equipment over European ones regardless of quality or price. Meanwhile in Europe it's a free market and the US is allowed to compete with European companies in government tenders.

&gt;
&gt;They will pass the costs down to the consumers, which will raise the cost of living which will lead to protests. E.g. you can tax airlines but the first casualty is likely to be affordability of flights for the poor.
&gt;

the poor dont fly, we don't care about that.

and if polluting products become more expensive people will go to less polluting competitors in stead, the fuel tax could have done this, if it was not accompanied with subsidies for company cars to the rich or if it would be compensated by alternative modes of transportation.

the issue here is yet another tax hitting the poorest when they go to work while that same government gave tax cuts to the wealthy, not just the fuel tax as an isolated incident in and by itself.

2899,"&gt;Or French could learn to build planes and rockets without rest of the union subsidizing them.

1) To begin with, Airbus isn't a French company.

It's a European corporation, partially and jointly owned by France (11%), Germany (11%) and Spain (4%), and mixes up engineering and technological expertises from several European countries.

&amp;nbsp;

2) The EU has literally nothing to do with the capabilities of France proper to build planes and rockets. 

France is, and always has been one of the leading countries in the fields of aeronautics and rocketry, and it's one of the very few countries around the world that has been independently and domestically designing and producing its own jets and rockets since WW2.

&amp;nbsp;

3) What France is actually lacking, on the other hand, is the industrial and economic power of a continent-sized country of 327 million people like the US.

It means it cannot directly compete globally on its own with aerospace giants such as Boeing, which can economically rely on a domestic market several times larger, and has been subsidised directly and undirectly for over half a century, through, among other things, tax breaks and governmental contracts of a vastly different magnitude.

Small-scale European aerospace companies partnering up to found Airbus was precisely an answer to this situation.

2976,"Part 2

After all, Great Britain offered car manufacturers two advantages: On the one hand, they had a well-established infrastructure including an established supplier industry and, on the other hand, they belonged to the EU market. This prompted Toyota, Honda and Nissan to set up plants in England a few decades ago in order to avoid customs duties for the EU. At the turn of the century BMW built a modern factory in Oxford for the new Mini, whose name rights had been secured by the purchase of Rover. Ford traditionally had production facilities in Great Britain, and GM, which built Opel models on the island under the Vauxhall label, had similar facilities. Jaguar and Land Rover have belonged to the Indian Tata Group since 2008, but have so far remained loyal to their locations in England.
Over 850,000 jobs depend on the car industry

Since the United Kingdom narrowly decided to withdraw from the EU in a referendum in June 2016 with 51.9 percent of the vote, the British car industry has been looking to the future with great concern. More than 850,000 jobs in the UK depend directly or indirectly on the car industry. Theresa May, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, postponed the first deadline on 31 March 2019, which the car manufacturers accepted partly with relief, but also partly with anger.

BMW, for example, had ordered its mini-production in Oxford to have the plant holidays, which were usually only held in the summer, held in April. One could have let the worst hustle and bustle after the Brexit pass by. Production problems followed, in addition there were great uncertainties for the import of the necessary components after the next Brexit date, because a storage of the individual parts would lead to immense costs.
Production slumped by one-fifth

When the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that his country would definitely leave the EU on 31 October 2019, with or without a deal, the remaining manufacturers in England expressly warned of the fatal consequences. Their production has already collapsed by around a fifth compared with the previous year, reaching only 666,521 passenger cars in the first half of 2019.

The foreign owners of the British plants cut their investments by 70 percent between January and June - suggesting that they want to leave the island. Nissan is currently the largest car manufacturer in the UK with 7000 employees, but is already relocating part of its production back to Japan. The Japanese manufacturer had chosen its location in Sunderland in the structurally weak north-east of England in 1984 and became one of the largest employers there. All the more astonishing that the inhabitants there voted for the Brexit with 61 percent.

2979,"Part 3

Honda plans to close its plant in Swindon in 2021, which will mean the loss of 3500 jobs, not counting the suppliers. Toyota wants to check by the beginning of next year whether they will continue to produce in Burnaston. In view of an export quota of 90 percent of the cars produced there for the EU, the decision to close the plant is likely to be made in the foreseeable future. The three Japanese manufacturers alone have so far been responsible for half of English car production.
Many plant closures have already been decided

BMW may close its mini plant in Oxford in the long term. Large quantities of the Mini are already being produced at VDL-NedCar in the Netherlands, and there are also concrete plans to move production of the Mini at least in part to South Africa, where BMW has had a plant in Rosslyn near Pretoria since the 1970s. Jaguar Land Rover was regarded as a prime example of successful refurbishment following the takeover by Tata in 2008. The newly developed models were well received by customers and sales figures increased.

But even the two traditional British companies are now feeling the icy Brexit wind. Tata announced a massive savings programme and 4500 of the 9100 jobs will be eliminated. Land Rover owns a flourishing plant in EU country Slovakia, where it has the Discovery and probably next year's new Defender manufactured. Ford, too, doubts the sense of the location Great Britain, closes its engine production in Bridgend, Southampton and Dagenham. The US company is already on a tough austerity course and wants to rethink its future involvement in the UK.

PSA boss Carlos Tavares announced that in the event of a no deal brexit, the next Astra generation would not be manufactured at the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, but in Southern Europe. But when the car companies leave Britain, countless British suppliers will also lose their customers, which will drive unemployment even higher.
Economic disaster for Great Britain

Boris Johnson continues to promise his countrymen, ignoring all serious economic forecasts, a Golden Age after the Brexite. Conscious of a certain economic disaster, he stubbornly sticks to the hard Brexit course to which he owes his post as prime minister.

The fact that the loss of the car industry will shake Great Britain in the market still seems to many Britons not to want to admit. They cling to the idea that once you're out of the EU, you can go back to times long gone. But the truth is that the car industry in Great Britain owed it only to its membership in the EU that it was still doing reasonably well.

3113,"&gt; The damage to the US economy is magnified if consumers and businesses have to switch to more expensive options.  

**Wrong**. You are making the faulty assumption that these are fungible commodities like oil for which US consumers were buying on an open market for the reason that those were the best priced goods. Locally produced alternatives for all of those goods are cheaper in the US. But as luxuries these goods all offer something a little different, status, taste, and other attributes for which US consumers were buying. Just because French wine will be tariffed does not mean that US consumers are going to have to import something more expensive than French wine. It means that they will be pushed to consume less French wine and more cheaper US produced wines. 

&gt;As explained, the EU can easily switch export nations.

This incorrect idea always is floated around when discussions of trade come up. The EU has been selling to as many customers as they could for the best profits they could. Finding more customers is not some trivial task. The buyer has the power in this relationship. You can't suddenly make Africa be able import as much French wine as the US was previously.

&gt;This means those with more trading partners. 

That's also not right as all trading partners do not have the same consumer base. The number of customers in each country which could afford to pay for imported food luxuries is different. The US has the largest consumer economy in the world and as such it is overwhelmingly disproportionately valuable as a economy to access.",,/r/europe/comments/dchccx/us_hits_scotch_whisky_italian_cheese_french_wine/f2a23l2/,yabn5,1570107499

&gt;The overall result including a huge majority in Scotland voting to remain, and a large majority of NI voting to remain. 

The overall result was that more people voted Leave than Remain.

&gt;Maybe according to some rule book or 'referendum user manual' or something, it is permissible to ignore these things in the*overall result*. But real life isn't like that is it. Humane politics and good societal administration don't dictate that.

It was a national vote, not a regional one. The country voted to Leave. You don't get to carve out exemptions for certain regions that happen to think they're special. 

&gt;Because red bus millions of monies for NHS all of Turkey will move to England we can be like Norway we will do a deal with Germany etc etc. All of that, and perhaps more, invalidates proceedings and the course of events that follow and therefore cannot allow for false affirmations.

Remain lied just as much. You want to overturn the vote because you don't like the result. Just admit it.

&gt;That is a gross over-simplification and somewhat dismissive hence those five words *seem bigoted*. It is akin to me stating that xenophobes form the majority on Britain.

In which case you clearly have no idea what bigotry is and, in trying to paint the majority of Brits as xenophobes, may in fact be a bigot yourself. 

&gt;Evidently eh. But that misses my point (I didn't make it very clear actually); the majority of residents in NI support the status quo - i.e. The GFA, EU membership and being a part of the UK - but that is not necessarily the same as being a Unionist. 

The UK voted against the status quo. Again, you can't overturn the result because one region happens to not like it. 

&gt;In the same way here a lot of people who support (or supported, in the 2014 referendum) the status quo are not necessarily Unionists or British Nationalists, but rather pay little mind to identity and instead focus on pragmatism.

You are falsely trying to apply the language of NI politics to Scotland. Unionism in NI is a distinct social and political identity.

It may seem pedantic but it's not. The power is within her remit, not his, and the fact that we have a monarch who will as convention do whatever the Prime Minister advises is historically unusual.

And with the Supreme Court ruling we have formalised that the judiciary is capable of overruling the monarch's judgement on the basis of their interpretation of a Prime Minister's advice.

We are in very odd territory, in large part because The Queen has become a political vacuum instead of a moderator/facilitator.

3179,"""Luxury"" items does not mean only German cars, though I suppose I could have used the term ""Premium.""  i.e., Kerry Gold butter imported from Ireland is premium butter. 

Let's use the Kerry example.  2 sticks of KG butter are $2.99, 8 sticks of Land O Lakes domestic goes for $5.99.  KG is very good butter, but if it went up a few more cents, most people are not going to pay for it.  It's not like there isn't other very good butter to replace KG, and if you want truly high end butter, you go to a farmer's market and buy it fresh.   

As far as clothes go, barely any clothes are made here at all, not really a factor.

wrt Airbus, those sanctions have been tailored to an extent:

&gt;The new U.S. list does spare some Airbus parts including sections of fuselage that are used to assemble A320s for American buyers at a plant in Mobile, Alabama. State officials in Alabama had lobbied for parts used by the plant to be spared.

&gt; The US has decided to attack everyone at once. They no longer have options. That puts them at a large disadvantage.

This case was filed in 2004, it wasn't a plan of attack to coincide with a trade war with China. Now, you are right that it's not very smart to be starting a huge trade war with the whole world.

Niinistö is a very well read career politician and diplomat. he doesn't say things like this randomly. Specially since Finnish Presidents are always traditionally *very carefull* about what they say in diplomatic occasion to maintain the mostly neutral and calm diplomatic posture of the nation.

Remember the Great Lord and Saviour of Europe, Viktor Orbán, the one saving Europe from the millions of migrants?

Yeah, he also sold 20,000 ""free movement in Schengen"" tickets, 250,000 EUR each to foreigners all around the World. Its basically a residency permit you could go and buy, if you got accepted you could live in Hungary. 

15,754 of those were bought by the Chinese, another 1265 goes to Russia, the remaining ones are shared between 57 countries including Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Vietnam, Turkey and Syria.

The quota that we fought against so hard couple months ago was supposed to give us around 10-20 thousand illegal immigrant, with checked backgrounds, that really came from a place where there was a war, where they had no home to go back to and lived in 15th century levels of civilization. 
 
Viktor Orbán and the Hungarian population *decllined* the quota.

But hey, we made hella dough, according to my calculations this move netted the country almost 500 million Euros.

3348,"Not OP, but I grew up in Berlin and in a southern European country, and lived for 2 years in an middle-sized Eastern German city, but I have some family in Western Germany. 

The differences between east and west are very hard to separate from regional differences in my opinion, it's like history put an additional layer of difference on these regions, as well as very different demographics, specifically regarding the economical situation and population density. Regions differ a lot from each other in all possible ways, even within former Western and former Eastern Germany. 

Culturally, every German region is maybe closest to their neighbouring countries, I'd say, so the federal states of Saxony and Brandeburg are rather similar to Western Poland and the Czech Republic in a lot of aspects, the Rhine Valley is close to France, core Bavaria close to Austria, and the very North of Germany close to Skandinavia.

Generally, I'd say that for young people the divide between rural and urban regions is even larger than regional divides nowadays, but the urban-rural divide is even larger in the former East than in the former West. Politically, you roughly have the same conservative-south-and-leftist-north division for both the former East and West in a mirroring way, with cities naturally being a lot more liberal. In my experience, the former East does seem to tend more to the extremes, as the traditional parties have not had the time to establish themselves as much as in the West, and everything is a bit more dynamic in that sense.

Finally, there is the clear heritage of the GDR and post-GDR collapse that is still present in the East: a weak economy, antiquated infrastructure, depopulated rural areas, a centralised around Berlin structure rather than broad federalist structures, a very young and not as stable liberal democracy, and a general lack of interest from the West, except for some adventurers searching for hip tourist destinations and a cheap way of life. It doesn't help much that the former East is so much smaller than the West in size, population and economy, either, but at the very least, Berlin was made federal capital (as much as that annoys some Wessi snobs) as some kind of counterweight to the over-powerful West. I had people from other countries often ask me how the two ""halves"" are growing together, but it is really crucial to understand that the former East is much, much smaller and more insignificant politically than the Western regions.

Today, I don't really think a lot in former-GDR terms personally, but more in regional terms, but I don't live in Germany anymore and I'm relatively young for German standards, so I might not be very representative. It is certainly still a problem that lots of people still don't know anything about other regions in Germany, and I always considered it a miniature of Europe in that sense - the federal republic of Germany faces problems very similar to the EU, on a smaller scale.",Circle of Stars,/r/europe/comments/dcn31g/happy_day_of_german_unity_germanys_national/f29dpzq/,amzyanti,1570093354

3412,"Several huge caveats:

- *districts* (okresy) in the Czech Republic are purely administrative divisions with little significance for people's day to day lives. They do **not** serve as electoral districts – this role is assigned to the administrative *regions* (kraje). However, the regions are too big while districts are of a suitable size to show a bit more granular results;

- this only shows the party ending up *first* in the given district; since Czechia is a multi-party democracy with a proportional voting system, this means that the first party being right/left wing doesn't necessarily mean the rest of the district is majority left/right wing. Keep that in mind! Analysing the whole result and adding up the other parties would require an order of magnitude more effort I am unwilling to expend at this point;

- notwithstanding the above, in the 1996-2010 period, the Czech political landscape was dominated by two 'broad-church' parties (rightwing Civic Democratic Party – ODS, and leftwing Social Democratic Party – ČSSD), so the results should be fairly close to the actual split of the electorate;

- for the purpose of this map, I classified parties as either right or left wing, with no middle ground. The left wing is represented by ČSSD and KSČM (the vestigial Communist Party), while the right-wing is represented by ODS and TOP09, two right-wing conservative-liberal parties. ANO (the present-day populist formation leading the Czech government) is, for the purposes of this map, classified as *left* wing. Now, this is hugely problematic because in the 2013 elections, the party still maintained a centrist, anti-corruption posture and many of its new voters came from right-wing parties. However, at present, the party behaves like a populist left-wing (large spending, handouts for key constituencies, appeals to the elderly and working classes) formation, hence I classified it as such. I understand that this may have distorted the overall image;

- The 2017 elections is *not* factored in because ANO won in all districts (really every single one), which would make the ""always votes X"" category essentially meaningless. I may make another map later showing districts according to overall preferences (i.e. whether anti-system populist parties have a majority, or more traditional non-populist parties dominate);

- Western Europeans please note: in Czechia, the usual situation where cities are mainly left-leaning while the countryside is more right-leaning is reversed in Czechia. This is mainly because the left is, due to historical development, the ""conservative"" force, while the right has been the driving force for change and reform. As a result, large urban centres in Czechia are mostly leaning centre-right (liberal, progressive), while rural regions lean towards the left;

- The situation is in flux after the 2017 election, because it almost completely rewrote the political map of Czechia. Both the old big parties are now humbled while ANO completely dominates the scene, plus there is an unprecedented number of parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of Czech Parliament).",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/dcn9ux/political_leanings_of_czech_districts/f298r74/,Victor_D,1570085875

Ukraine: 30 years of lessons on how to help yourself

Christopher Hartwell and Oleh Havrylyshyn yesterday

Last month, the Trump administration finally released approximately $250m in military aid for Ukraine after a delay that critics and a possible whistleblower said was politically motivated.

Donald Trump’s defenders have noted that the president’s actions, whatever they actually may have been, towards Ukraine were intended to help a “corrupt country” clean itself up. And indeed, still fighting Russian-backed separatists in the east of its country, Ukraine once again stands at a crossroads of economic and political reform.

With a new president and a brand-new parliament, it has a key opportunity to shed its image of corruption and undertake real and effective reform. But while the US aid was military in nature, the precarious nature of donor funding — including from the IMF — underlines how important it is for Ukraine to stand on its own two feet. 

Luckily, three decades of economic transformation throughout central and eastern Europe have given a blueprint to President Volodymyr Zelensky’s team on how Ukraine can become stronger and more resilient.

November 2019 will mark 30 years since the Berlin Wall fell and signalled the beginning of a massive and novel experiment never seen before in history, the transition from communism to capitalism in the countries of the Soviet bloc.

With the hindsight of three decades, several key lessons have been learned on what makes a “successful” transition, lessons that Ukraine should heed. Unfortunately, many of the polemics of the first decade of transformation have crystallised into a series of myths about transition, arguing for a much slower approach.

The first myth, prevalent even among western politicians from the left, is that neoliberal big-bang reforms in communist countries caused tremendous pain for little gain. While socialists and neo-socialists in the region and elsewhere claim that economic reform can be done slowly over time, the reality of transition tells a different story.

Comprehensive statistical analysis of the past 30 years confirms that adjustment pain did inevitably occur at the outset of transition, but, more importantly, that pain was limited and of short duration in countries that moved fastest to a market regime (notably most of central Europe and the Baltics). For countries that moved most gradually and lingered in a mixed socialist/market hybrid, as in the former Soviet Union or the Balkans, the pain was far greater and persisted for longer.

This disparity between fast and slow reformers is evident not only in the statistics for broad measures such as gross domestic product and GDP per capita, but also for finer measures such as the Human Development Index of the UN, poverty and income distribution, and levels of per capita consumption of key goods. Illustrative of these diverging roads is the fact that while Ukraine and Poland started the transition with about the same level of per capita income, today Poland’s income is from three to four times larger.

Equally important for Ukraine is the myth that it was market reforms which created an extortive oligarch class, a common complaint also against swift reforms made with reference to Russia. The reality here is also different: the greatest concentration of oligarch power is not in the rapid reformers of central Europe, but in those like Ukraine which delayed reforms for years and moved slowly thereafter.

Russia merits a special mention here, as it started reforms well in 1992-93 under President Boris Yeltsin and the reformer Yegor Gaidar, but then stalled and reversed as the old guard came back to power. To illustrate the difference with central Europe, it has been estimated that if Poland had the same number of Forbes billionaires in proportion to GDP as does Russia, there would be about 38; the actual number is four. Equally striking are comparisons of inequality, as in Russia the income share of the top 1 per cent is 20 per cent or more, while in central Europe it runs at about half that.

But the best argument against these “go-slow” strategies for Ukraine is its own experience. In the 1990s, it endured a series of stop-start reforms, and has always lagged countries such as its neighbour Poland in creating the basis for a market economy.

Incomplete reforms such as full property rights, stymied by a “temporary” moratorium on agricultural land sales in place since 2001, have held back Ukraine’s development. In every case, the argument against these reforms has been the same, mainly that the “market wasn’t ready” or the “supporting institutions didn’t exist”, though closer analysis suggests the real reason for delayed reforms was the self-interest of rent-seeking leaders and their oligarch patrons.

This embrace of gradualism has created a fragile Ukraine vulnerable to economic blackmail and military aggression. Jettisoning the slow pace of liberalisation for a speedier move towards openness can help reverse this state of affairs. With an emphasis on protecting property rights and lessening the power of the state, Ukraine may soon find it will need less help from its friends.

Early indications are that the new government in Kiev does intend to move in this direction, but it must not allow established vested interests to oppose this move with a repetition of these debunked canards. If Ukraine’s new government relies on the real historical evidence, it too will find that rapid reform is far more successful than gradual ones.

3535,"What about dogs? They attack people too, but I do not see you preaching to exterminate them?

What about one of the biggest human attackers and killers out there? [The moskito](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mosquitoes-kill-more-humans-human-murderers-do-180951272/). Why aren't you preaching their extermination.

But especially what about humans, who have attacked and killed more humans that any other being on this planet. Why don't you preach their extermination?

Leaving sarcasm behind for a minute: you never walk alone in wolf/bear territory. 

I live in Romania and I do mountain trekking at least once a month, but very rarely alone. I have felt more threatened by semi-feral horse herds and by sheep dogs, than by wolves or bears. The secret: be aware that yiu are on their territory and make yourself known before hand (make noise). In Europe, because we have constantly persecuted them, bears and wolves have become naturally shy of humans. That does not mean that if you encounter a desperately hungry wolf or bear, he will run away. That's why, do not be alone in their territory.

Here in Romania, we have the largest populations of brown bear, wolves and I think lynx. Even with the heavy deforestation and habitat destruction, in the past 5 years we have not had any news regarding wolves attacking people. There were few bear attacks, which in the end were the fault of the humans because they did not keep their distance from the bear. There have been many more news of people torturing to death bear and lynx cubs though.

The same way nowadays, the anglo-french wars of 1202-1204 and 1213-1214, Phillip Augustus having spent a good part of his reign bullying John Lackland (Jean sans Terre in french), the Saintonge War, the War of Saint-Sardos etc are all viewed as french victories over the English by historians but I doubt people back then saw any of those conflicts as the nation of France vs the nation of England due to how connected both kingdoms still were at the time.",,/r/europe/comments/dcbzwx/with_brexit_moving_closer_france_and_ireland/f28l5xb/,Okiro_Benihime,1570064338

2.Or they are wrong and their enterprise stagnates and if the idea is even useful others will enter the market too, eventually.

I will try to state to what I believe is a weakness of this approach to funding.

This method works towards enterprises, where it's revenue must exceed what it spends. It is not well-adapted to research and is in fact much less efficient at allocating resources.

In the scientific method, a hypothesis may be disproven and no tangible discovery or 'product' is created. However, it still eliminates a hypothesis, thus increasing known knowledge, since the decision to research is still firmly in the hands of the ones conducting research. In this method, resources would be wasted on ""scams"" or ventures with no scientific merit whatsoever, in comparison to the current situation where even 'failures' produce benefits via a disproven hypothesis. You acknowledged that scientifically illiterate investors would be unable to make effective business decisions, and thus requires investors to also be the scientists, or the scientists to be the investors. 

The conclusion to that situation would be that scientists would need investors who are also scientists, who they themselves would need investors who are scientists to fund their projects. It's circular, and would likely not increase funding for the sciences or solve the current issue of scientists not having enough funding, and would perhaps even decrease the amount of scientists actively researching.

In addition, it requires the existence of an entity with enough technical know-how and funds to discern the best investments, which at the moment, doesn't exist I believe. At least at the level to compensate for the loss of the public sector.

Even if it did, what barriers are preventing this investor from acting?

&gt;Mind that this is the case in an ""ideal"" market, a free market without coercive and price signal distorting influences.

I will likely try to give a more in-depth response to your post after reviewing the books, but I think this may be at the heart of why I disagree.

Your ideal relies on knowledgeable investors and investment mechanisms that do not exist. Two important factors missing for a precarious situation that is to occur in a month.

I believe your proposal would not face such push-back in a more neutral and theoretical setting, because economic experiences in crisis situation carry further risks. Some would be able to discuss this with more neutrality if the livelihood of former colleagues were not one the line.

Your ideas have merit, and I will continue to read the book, but continuing on, it may be better to divorce the proposal from Brexit, because in it's current state, I think that ideal would only lead to the destruction of research institutions.",France,/r/europe/comments/dca847/nuclear_fusion_lab_praised_by_boris_johnson_in/f28bduq/,frissio,1570057232

The cost of replacement is borne by the panel manufacturer, so it is already included in the panel cost. It's been this way for half a decade now.

They can agree to get it recycled themselves and invoice you, they can use your own take-back scheme, which will be mentioned on the paperwork they got when they bought it, etc.

Seriously if you've got a solar panel, try and find the paperwork you got when you bought it, if it doesn't say about your rights under weee, then they're already not complying, and I would recommend getting in touch with them about it about how they plan to cover taking it off your hands when it no longer works (the legal minimum).

That's a distinct possibility.

&gt; There has also been various comments saying that a lot of the pro-Brexit motivation is financial people trying to avoid EU regulations soon coming into force. To turn the UK into a Singapore-like tax haven. Perhaps Johnson has some kind of financial payout waiting if he forced a no-deal Brexit, ensuring that those regulations don't take force. So perhaps Johnson doesn't care about the future of the Conservative party?

&gt;  
&gt;you've been told this repeatedly

I'm going to off the opinion of the high court in northern Ireland who have already ruled on this.

*“Neither NIA 1998 nor the international treaty scheduled to the Belfast Agreement (or, for that matter, the Agreement itself) has the effect in law of requiring the continued membership of the EU on the part of the UK.*

*The Supreme Court was alert to this in Miller: see \[129\]. Furthermore, none of the sources mentioned subjects the EU 27 to conclude an Article 50 Withdrawal Agreement in any particular terms.”*

*“Once again, neither the Belfast Agreement nor this suite of provisions was predicated on the basis that UK membership of the EU would continue forever.* ***Neither of them can be construed as requiring a customs Union or continued regulatory alignment.*** *More fundamentally, there is no sufficient evidential foundation for the incompatibility asserted. There is no suggestion that the incompatibility has already materialised”*

That's not correct: NI would be with CU+SM for goods and SPS regulation, GB only CU. And GB can diverge from EU regulation and it can unilaterally exit from CU.

But yes, it's impossible to have everything as it is if theUK won't be a member of CU and SM. And that's apparently not what british government wants.

Both parties can be called euroskeptic. Neither wishes to leave the EU, but the Left Bloc seeks to reform it and abandon some treaties, while PCP seeks to abandon several of those treaties, revoke others and work with the European partners to essentially disband the EU.

Now, finally, one could argue that CDS also has some euroskeptic positions, more in line with parties in ECR than in EPP, but I don't think it's fair to qualify it as euroskeptic yet.

4129,"&gt; Nuclear testing in 1995 was really out of fashion

Because nuclear powers such as the united states or hte USSR had already fully experimented before the treaty of 1996. So there was little need for them to do more.

France on the other hand had slowed it s tests during the mitterand period and was really late. And since it was forbidden after the treaty france had to quickly make the last tests. In total france has done 181 tests (while being one of the major 4 nuclear powers), very little compared to the whopping one thousand from the US. 

In 1995 under the chirac administration 6 tests were ordered. Only 2 of them were directly signed by Chirac the others were left waitng to be signed by the executive from the last government. Out of the 6 only 3 were for military purpose.

People will say it destroyed the environnement and it's true in some ways. Out of the 20 sites used 11 are fully restored while 9 are expected to die. Very little of it is due to chirac, probably not even 1%.

Beside the local population was in favor of the test. It s often ignored but France paid the locals for the tests. It was a major source of wealth for the region and since it ended the region has become one of the poorest / most problematic ones. Todays without france money people of the region are relying on a big mine which is also a catastrophe for the environnement.

4178,"Except the global trade gloom has almost nothing at all to do woth brexit and would be happening even if the UK voted remain.


The global economy is entering a downward trend because the long term debt cycle is hitting at the same time as the short term debt cycle, as the temporary lifeline of QE is slowed/stopped, as a result of the US/China trade war putting downward pressure on global trade which hits confidence, as the BRICS countries all start slowing down and having domestic troubles, and finally because of the underlying Eurocrisis which never went away, was only covered by a plaster of the ECB using quantitative easing to try bolster european growth (look how dismal growth is even with QE).


I’m sorry to this subreddit, but brexit and the British are just not as important to the world economy as you guys keep making out.  If you broke down all the factors that are going to cause the very likely global recession/depression that will probably hit soon, brexit would barely account for 1%.

Damn even the UK is not going to feel drastic impacts from it. The economists say the worst possible consequences of brexit will amount to about 0.1-0.2% lost growth potential a year, but that we will still grow, about a year of occasional shortages of goods as supply lines readjust and maybe a few 100,000 job losses which the UK can easily afford.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/dc783t/merkel_brexit_means_europe_not_blameless_in/f27dye3/,ThunderousOrgasm,1570036080

4216,"&gt;Yes you can. That's how companies develop innovations and technology: they pay their employers to do thing A, but they don't pay for them to do thing B.

Now you are just confusing subsidies with research and development.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So you are saying farmers are lazy?

I'm saying that money that is received for not doing anything is not 'worth' as much as money you earn or save yourself. A company needs a bottom line to make sure that they stay productive and profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And *that's partly why they get subsidies*.

So you need to dole out subsidies because of the cumbersome taxes and rules that you already forced on those companies? That is just a vicious cycle of decreased productivity and increased taxes. Which is exactly what I'm railing against. You don't create wealth with taxes, nor with rules.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also, if that ""valuable time and money"" is less time and money for environmentally harmful things like cattle farming, *then they should spend their time and money on something else than cattle farming*.

I thought we needed the food which is a direct result of these farmers' activities. We need the food and the economic activity, it's that simple.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because humans need food. And if EU loses the ability to produce food, EU can be manipulated by those feeding EU. It is literally a major focus on governments to secure some self sufficiency in food production. If markets cannot provide food security, then it is up to governments to upkeep it.

Markets are perfectly capable of producing enough food. The whole point of this Nitrogen discussion in The Netherlands is because our farmers are incredibly efficient relative to the amount of land and resources they use.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They cannot keep their businesses afloat without subsidies because food prices are so low.

Then the prices should go up so the farmers can make some money off their production. Don't just go throwing around subsidies without an end in sight.

4252,"A little bit ""meh"" by the article. 

What it means by ""create wealth"" is just how to redistribute capital gains across workers. That makes sense for a startup: in a traditional company, workers may be incentived on profit, to have their objectives aligned with the stock holders (that remunerate on dividends). However, startups don't make profit, and stock holders earn money by eventual (huge) capital gains, it seems faire to align workers interest on capital gain.

As the article says, at least in France, everything is in place, we have our kind of stock-options called BSPCE and I call bullshit any startup that doesn't distribute these stock-options to their early employees.

However startups in Europe have a bigger problem than redistribute wealth. It's creating it. We don't have enough world-succesful startups and there is a reason about it.

The reason why we're not creating enough wealth: market sizes. European consumer markets are quite separated one from each other, and the American market is too hard to enter. So a European startup only can expand easily to its own domestic market (let say 60 million inhabitants for France). To enter other markets, it will have to do adaptations of its offer (laws, language, consumer habits, existing business ecosystem, local payment means…) and duplicate marketing effort and customer support costs. And will still see the American market closed. Entering the American market has been the graveyard of most of our startups. While an American startup has from the start a 250 M people market without any adaptation to make, and can easily spread worldwide.",France,/r/europe/comments/dcawr4/why_its_so_hard_for_startups_to_create_wealth_in/f271kxc/,Vindve,1570028658

Flat renting prices have been going up fast in the last few years though, so that situation may change (and not for the better).

By not using a definition for a peninsula that can be misinterpreted on a cultural basis?

&gt; the already existing definitions open up a lot of interpretations 

Exactly my point. And my other point, that yours do too, so it doesn't solve anything, just replaces one cultural take with another.

I'm in awe that you dared to depict the Silesian duchies. These are the true medieval mess on HRE level.

One example of the mess: there was small enclave east of Auschwitz duchy (enklawa krzęcińska), separated by thin Polish corridor. By 1444 it was part of Auschwitz duchy. In 1445 it became part of the new Zator duchy and later got sold to Poland. [Map 1](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Enklawa_krzecinska.png), [map 2](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radwanitenkorridor#/media/Datei:Duchy_of_Auschwitz_border_changes.png).

[Krnov duchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Krnov) is missing. ([Map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ducatus_Troppaviensis_(Blaeu_1645_-_Silesia_Ducatus\).jpg), [later map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Krnov#/media/File:Silesian_principality_of_Krnov_1736.jpg) - not for the weak.) It was separated from Ratibor duchy in 1437.


It is interesting that you use Czech names for cities (Lehnice, Vratislav) and German names for the duchies. I'd checked it, and by 1444 they were in the process of moving from German as administrative language to the Czech.

I don't believe the rebels did it on purpose, but I do believe that someone pointed them to it as if it was THE Ukrainian transport with military personal they expected and lead the plane through the corridor (there was one that was supposed to take off at the same time that was to carry Ukrainian troops). The theory has to sides:  


Side 1 - Russian involvement. Russian ...call them ""secret service""... saw that the conflict in the East of Ukraine was getting too intense and was slipping from their control. They intended it to be a distraction from Crimea and to compensate the loss of pro-Russian representation with Crimea being annexed the conflict would polarize the entire population of Eastern Ukraine with heavy anti-western sentiment... in turn resulting in pro-Russian representation in Ukrainian government after all the voting was said and done. The rebels instead of getting stuck progressed towards the Southern coast of Ukraine. The world wasn't reacting quickly enough and some were just ignoring it... until the plane was brought down. Russian perspective - trade the lives of foreign kids and families for many more lives of Russian/Ukrainian kids and families since this would stall the conflict (and it did). Russia did not want a full scale war that would surly result in NATO troops being pulled in. They bombed Serbia into oblivion, who is to say they wouldn't do it in Ukraine.

Theory 2 - Ukrainian secret service for the same reason. Point the plain, feed false info to the rebels through a trusted contact, plane goes down, Russians go wooooowa and pull back. World is now paying attention. Tour the world and use the event pumping it up with fresh images, inserting a ton of propaganda along the lines of toys being stolen from the crash to make sure the world is paying attention. As the result hundreds/thousands of Ukrainian lives would be saved since now there was a spotlight on what's going on.  


As painful as it may be for me to admit this, but either possibility has a non-zero chance of being at least partially correct. The momentum was instantly lost after the event.

While Arabia is universally seen as the largest peninsula in the world, India and Europe are still larger peninsulas. But the world chooses to define them differently. It's pretty obvious that Europe is connected to Asia. With the definition of Europe in the OP, Scandinavia is it's own thing geographically (not culturally). And of course you could consider many surrounding islands to be 'islands of Europe' or 'European islands'.

And the problem with the Ural mountains definition is that the mountain range is completely outside of the European peninsula. And south to them is empty space of flat land that connects Europe to the rest of Asia. So it is not the same way the Himalayas separate India from Tibet/China.

France is the biggest proponent of nuclear with the best regulatory environment, where they type-certify reactors. Even there they have huge cost overruns by a factor of three and take it takes twice as long as they were supposed to. The super high standard of everything in a NPP makes that more likely to occur.

It already took 12 years and 11 billion EUR to build 1600 MW in Flamanville (still not operational) [3]. It was planned at 5 years and 3 billion. It took India 2 years and 1 billion to build the same amount of solar [4].

4779,"&gt;So maybe we can all stop circlejerking and realize that there are no simple answers that solve all issues.

Won't happen anytime soon. But to give you one additional chart why nuclear cannot supply the demand comes from this chart:

 [https://energytransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/craig1.png](https://energytransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/craig1.png) 

That is the yearly energy demand (this case 2011-2012) that must be met in France and the magenta part is electric heating.

To supply this peak demand with nuclear energy, all the infrastructure costs would have to be paid with way less units of energy produced, meaning way higher prices (think 12 times as much, even with only NPPs that would be 60 cents per kWh)

And what do you do with the surplus energy  during summer? It never makes any sense to throttle a nuclear plant down, as you don't save money with it (the fuel is essentially free) Produce hydrogen maybe to use in winter? Yeah that is possible, but once you have that option you can do the same with solar and wind for a reduced baseline costs.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/dbz7rd/effect_of_the_3day_storm_in_central_europe_on_the/f266j7d/,Alcobob,1569995511

I doubt it matters much though because so long as energy is privatised it will never be clean.

Think about what precedent this sets, 50 years from now when solar farms have to be replaced will companies choose to make that expense or divest after abandoned panels are found to be toxic?

4899,"It's not so much dependent on reactors but what you do afterwards.

The waste can be reprocessed, the weakly-radioactive U-238 and the Plutonium ""leftovers"" can be removed from the waste. The plutonium can then be mixed with new reactor fuel (MOX), the depleted uranium has fewer uses but can be managed easily with minimal containment as it is not very dangerously radioactive.

This reduces the amount of nuclear waste drastically (France stores all its high-level nuclear waste in a single warehouse), but comes with increased cost and proliferation concerns. You can make a (very small) nuclear bomb with reactor grade plutonium so you better keep a close eye on it!

All things considered though, even without reprocessing, nuclear waste is an overblown issue because:

A: The overall volume of nuclear waste generated by nuclear power plants is *minuscule*. It's a coke can's worth of unprocessed nuclear waste per person per lifetime of energy use.

B: It's not really a pressing issue, we have plenty of time to figure out what to do with the waste. Nuclear waste is currently stored in thick concrete casks in temporary locations. The waste itself is a solid material that doesn't readily ""leak"" anywhere and frankly, if  society can't manage to replace a few concrete casks every few decades then society has a *MUCH* bigger problem to deal with.


The real problem with nuclear power is that current nuclear technology isn't very good at breeding fissile material so mined Uranium is all we have for current and upcoming generations of nuclear power plants. It's not a renewable source of energy at the moment, until we develop breeders we're at risk of running out of Uranium.

Another big problem is that startup costs are enormous and schedule overruns are very common because sourcing the necessary materials and skills to build the reactors is proving to be very difficult. The west doesn't really have a Nuclear power ""supply chain"" anymore. Unlike say South Korea, Japan, Russia and China, the West has kind of forgotten how to build nuclear reactors so it has to start over from square one really.",Iceland,/r/europe/comments/dbymp5/council_of_the_european_union_maintains_nuclear/f2632bh/,Icelander2000TM,1569991574

calling lifejackets a ""prolonged death sentence"" is one of the dumbest things i've ever heard. it's emergency equipment. it's designed for you to be visible, and to keep you floating until rescue arrives. a life jacket is not supposed to be a houseboat. it doesn't have a kettle or Wi-Fi either.

if 5 people died IMPROPERLY using safety or emergency equient which had saved 5,000 (arbitrary numbers) lives when used properly, would that really be good enough reason to remove the equipment and replace it with nothing?

5000,"Having sheepdogs or donkeys isn’t a 100% protection. I had a relative who tried his hand at farming sheep, he was doing excellently up until one day some dogs running wild from their negligent owners managed to dig under his fence and enter. The guard animals gathered up most of the flock, protected them and loudly alerted him to the threat, but they couldn’t do anything for the stragglers from the initial scattering when the dogs attacked. They mauled or tore out the throat of over a dozen mostly pregnant sheep, all of whom would die eventually, some after suffering through great torment. My relative was able to shoot those dogs dead before they caused further damage thanks to the warning, but he had to spend days going up and down hills and in a creek to collect the bodies of these heavy sheep; he was part of a program that certified his sheep as high quality and free from certain pernicious diseases, and to fulfill it he had to bring in every dead sheep he had to be tested. Ultimately the loss both financially and emotionally (the piece of shit owners of the dogs naturally had no money with which to pay him any restitution, only insults about how he killed their innocent darling puppies) crippled his operations and ended his time as a sheep farmer.

That’s damage from a couple of dogs. Wolves are bigger and meaner, and especially Eurasian wolves of the sort likely to be introduced are much more aggressive towards humans.

&amp;#x200B;

People fuck other people. Shocking I know? People having sex and breeding with other people? Holy shit sometimes they even do it with someone they are not 100% ethnically comparable to. Its like a Greek person now claiming they are the same people as those in antiquity. Those people don't exist no more. Globalization has only accelerated thanks to the internet but even since colonial times we have had plenty of ethnic mixing. If only you could accurately trace your ancestry you would see a whole bunch of 0.1% and 0.2% this and that as well as your primary ethnicity. 

&amp;#x200B;

So back to my point. Calling Macedonians 'Bulgarians' is the same as saying all Canadians are American. Or all Brazilians Portugese. Yes the Portugese had their royalty reside in Brazil one point in history. Do Bolivians call Brazilians Portugese though? No because thats retarded. We refer to people as their ***NATIONALITY*** when talking about them online. If you have an issue with the country then just say so. All these pathetic attempts to try and sound cool or whatever online is a bit of a failure on your behalf. No matter what your racist little mind comes up with as an argument, you can't beat the simple fact that what you have said is nothing short of racism. You have a prejudice against a country and you find any way to try argue against its legitimacy. No other country in this world faces an issue like this where the people are so brazingly attacked online by Bulgarians/Greeks just because they comment or post something online. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't worry I understand generations of indoctrination has polluted your simple mind and that none of what I said would make a difference to you.

As for ""random country"", it might be worth looking into the contextual history of the time. CS was the defacto sole democracy left in central Europe, but if you still believe that ""random"" is an apt qualifier, then carry on.

And about the not fighting part. It's quite complex and something that has been a topic of continuous debates ever since. Easiest way to describe it to someone who doesn't seem to know what they are talking about;

Put yourself in a position when you count on the help of friends should a situation call for it. When the time comes, not only are they not there for you, but they also played a key part by going behind your back (that's where the ""Munich Dictate/Betrayal"" label comes from). What sort of impact would that have on you?

I can go on about CS having the best fortifications in Europe and a decently reformed military structure but all that means jack when the best case scenario would just be the prolonging of a total loss (no historian, afaik, ever suggested that CS could defend itself alone in 1938).

Anyway, this isn't the whole story. Finnish kids went to school earlier (meaning historically) than in many other countries and had to learn social basics. Almost all men spent at least two years in the military between 1918-1945 and after that about a year.

The commission is just as democratically legitimized as your national ministers or members of their respective ressorts. It is democracy at &gt;the national level&lt;.

As I pointed out in another comment, shift power from commission to parliament and you will have an actual loss of souvereignity.

Those repair shops are forced to cannibalize other machines for parts, or use parts that are not Apple-made. The issue with that is Apple are implementing security chips in their devices that detect this, and do not allow the device to work post- repair.

We 'rationalize' it because this behaviour is core of our being. The furthest we go in our instincts is our family or other close social group. People actually sacrificing their own well being for the good of many are nothing more than extremely rare aberration.

&gt;**In EU corridors, the use of English makes people complain**

&gt;*In the European Union, more and more voices are being raised against the omnipresence of English in communications, to the detriment of other languages, in particular French and German, which also have the status of working languages. Eurocrats of various nationalities have launched a petition in favour of multilingualism.*

&gt;The death of Jacques Chirac was announced on Thursday morning. At the daily press briefing, the Commission's spokesperson, Bulgarian Mina Andreeva, expressed the condolences of her institution and its President, Jean-Claude Juncker, which is normal. But, to everyone's surprise, she does it in English! However, she speaks perfectly French, Molière's language is the second language in the press room, English, French and German are the Commission's working languages and the 24 languages of the Union have the status of official languages... Would it occur to the Commission to offer its condolences in French following the death of a former British Prime Minister or a former German Chancellor? No, of course not.

&gt;This oddity reveals the abuses to which the English-speaking monolingualism that prevails within the Community institutions leads: from now on, we no longer even realize that we are addressing a people in a language that they do not understand and that they do not have to understand, English.

&gt;*Defend multilingualism*

&gt;This brutal domination is both the result of enlargement - this language, or rather its impoverished version, globish being the lowest common denominator - and also of the will of part of the European administrative apparatus. Thus, the Secretary General of the Council of the EU, the Danish Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, has just instructed his services, most of whose members speak perfectly French, to send only notes in English to the new President of the European Council of Heads of State and Government, the Belgian Charles Michel, a Francophone...

&gt;This de facto unilingualism, since no one has ever discussed it, is increasingly felt by European officials themselves, who have probably taken the Union's motto: ""United in diversity"" for granted. A group of Eurocrats of all nationalities has just launched a petition addressed to the new President of the Commission, the German Ursula von der Leyen (she will take office in November), who is reputed to be multilingual, in order to defend French and multilingualism more broadly.

&gt;If we read them, the situation is close to a discriminatory policy since they are claiming the right ""to use French without hiding and without apologizing"". For these officials, ""English monolingualism restricts us in our means of expression"", especially since the quality of this language is constantly deteriorating, the number of native English speakers being particularly low within the institutions, a situation that Brexit will not improve. They show how English has not imposed itself as a miracle but because a few people well placed in the administrative apparatus have decided to do so. The signatories therefore call on Von der Leyen to proclaim the right of everyone to express themselves in one of the three working languages and to promote multilingualism. In short, to simply apply one of the fundamental rights of the Union.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/dbt266/dans_les_couloirs_de_lue_lusage_de_langlais_fait/f23qm0l/,wisi_eu,1569934940

Anywho, to make it short - no. Poles were not majority, not by any chance and there were exactly zero German villages in those two disputed territories (the German villages were further south in mining area which Germans settlers inhabited several centuries prior when minerals were discovered and Habsburgs started mining operations and moved the German engineers and their families there to oversee it as locals knew fuck all about mining). Lemkos don't have any village there as well, they live further east.

Bela Kun may have been a commie, but he was commie only because the monarchy felt to shit, no matter how Horthy tried to pretend that it still exists with some empty throne, and needed a new rallying cry in order to counter French-overseen partition in Szekelyland and Slovakia.

You forgot Poland 

 *At noon on 30 September, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague time until noon the following day. At 11:45 a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague and told him that Poland could have what it wanted. The Polish Army, commanded by General* [*Władysław Bortnowski*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Bortnowski)*, annexed an area of 801.5 km² with a population of 227,399 people.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 *The Germans were delighted with this outcome. They were happy to give up a provincial rail centre to Poland; it was a small sacrifice indeed. It spread the blame of the partition of Czechoslovakia, made Poland an accomplice in the process and confused the issue as well as political expectations. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of* [*Nazi Germany*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) *– a charge that Warsaw was hard put to deny.*[*\[5\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Czechoslovak_border_conflicts#cite_note-Watt_1998,_386-5) 

&amp;#x200B;

 *Poland occupied some northern parts of Slovakia and received from Czechoslovakia* [*Zaolzie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaolzie)*, territories around Suchá Hora and Hladovka, around Javorina, and in addition the territory around* [*Lesnica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesnica,_Star%C3%A1_%C4%BDubov%C5%88a_District) *in the* [*Pieniny*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieniny) *Mountains, a small territory around* [*Skalité*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skalit%C3%A9) *and some other very small border regions (they officially received the territories on 1 November 1938 (see also* [*Munich Agreement*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) *and* [*First Vienna Award*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vienna_Award)*).*

5626,"I'm not philologist, but I think there are ultimately no rules in the language regarding this, and logically it can't be rigidly fixed at all.

Geographical places often change names partially or completely. Foreign language(not spoken at the place in question) most often doesn't inherently have names for them, those are brought in through communication with the native population. With time sometimes the change is propagated to other languages (definitely more often in the case of renaming), sometimes it gets stuck (like in the example you bring). I think, if it doesn't hinder communication, it is fine to use either one. 

At this point a person using spelling ""Kyiv"" actively shows acknowledgment of Ukraine's sovereignty, and respect to it's culture, specifically to the desire to be distinguished from Russian Federation.

If the political system values capitalism and free market excessively, the system does not dare to factor in the externalities, because factoring in externalities requires regulation of free market and and private resources (fossil fuels).

&gt;The only way I can imagine of getting around that would be to have a society run by genius-tier Philosopher-Kings keeping their egos in check with micro-doses of LSD and given absolute godlike power over the entire world to rule as they see fit.

If that is *the best* idea you can come up with, I find your imagination about solving political issues rather poor.

A more grounded idea is that we must view that capitalism and free markets are useful *as tools and methods*, not goals themselves. And when we realize this, it is politically much more easier to regulate markets and fossil fuels and factor in the externalities, since we can recognize that something is not good just because it is capitalist and free market.

Beside, I'm not judging UK here. It followed it's own foreign policy of failed Empire and tried to maintain peace and status quo in Europe. It also disliked the new small states and prefered to deal with large powers. Appeasement failed, but noone could know back then

For me, the important part of Munich is that 4th powers enforced their decition on 5th country and coarced it into accepting it, which meant end of such country. Democracies fed another Democracy to Fascists.

It's important lesson for future and everytime someone speaks about ""western values"", people in east should listen carefully. Because imho it's still the same values.

Chamberlain's actions were one of the major reasons why the war was fought so bitterly in the first place, why it could have been easily lost due to the brilliant decision to hand the regional industrial hub over to Nazis, and why Hitler actually had the time and resources to invest into committing the worst mass-scale atrocity ever commited, in the middle of the worst military conflict in history no less.

If you're curious, bucke up. 

Say you're a romanian oligarch, and as all oligarchs you want to make some cheese, some cheddar, if you get me.

Amitite? 

So, what do you do? You sell shit, what else. But what to sell? These people are poor and the only thing that I could sell is the ye old state own local industry from the Communist era. How do I sell it? I mean it works for 30 years, they definitely know how to run that business, but what if I place my guy in charge, he buys some expensive shit, then sell that expensive shit as scrap metal. Ya might be wandering why? Well, the money from the scrap metal, I get a commission, but that's not the real target,, it's just a small piece of gorgonzola, ya know, to tickle the taste buds. How to get the cheese? Well, now I have a friend with a company that is in det and needs money. Perfect, me and the boys set it up for the company to switch from state owned company to private own company, by selling it, I mean look at it, it has det, no more equipment, what ever shall we doo. I know, sell it for 1 dollar to ya know who. And you know who sells it to me. And i sell it, government paid, det free, private owned, profitable company, and made a fuck ton of money.
