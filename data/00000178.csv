From his own (now deleted - not sure if he just didn't maintain the website or what). Automod tells me I'm not allowed to link to archive.org, but in the interest of including sources, especially since I asked for one myself, you can find it by checking out the June 2018 archive of richardgrenell.com/about:

&gt;  Grenell is the longest serving U.S. spokesman in history at the United Nations, having served from 2001-2008. 

[...] 

&gt;  Grenell served as the United States Spokesman during the world body’s most turbulent time. He led communications strategies on issues such as: the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq; peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Liberia, the Congo and Sudan; the conflict in the Middle East; Iran’s nuclear weapons program; North Korea’s nuclear proliferation; Syria/Lebanon conflict; Israel’s security; and the UN’s Oil for Food Corruption scandal.

The worst part? As bad as this guy is?  He seems to have gotten *worse* at his job.

As a spokesman, he sold the world all that crap above and now can't sell water in the Sahara.

Or... he was always terrible and all of the people he ""advised"" (apparently Bolton included) just worked around him for some reason.

Now that he's on his own, well, he seems to completely embody the [Peter principle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)

61,"&gt;You're delirious. I've lived in Germany, Hungary, and Russia as an American diplomat's family member. Trust me when I say that you have no idea at all what you're talking about. These are regurgitated Fox News talking points about a feverishly reimagined world outside Fortress America, and they have no meaningful relationship with the reality that the rest of us experience.

Yeah, I also have family in high places, and I've personally worked for the lot you worship in the Middle East, Northern Cyprus, and the EU, but unlike you, I took a minute to examine whether or not they were full of shit.  Whether their consensus was based on principles or just...consensus.  I probably thought just like you do until I experienced war first hand and learned what the stakes of politics actually were.

&gt; and they have no meaningful relationship with the reality that the rest of us experience.

Right, because I'm talking about where we're headed, not where we are now. All you've done is illustrate the nature of predictions.

&gt;You're declaring Germany and the EU to be enemies of the United States after decades of cooperation and close coordination NATO?

No, I'm saying they are headed that way by siding with our enemies instead of us, and trying to subvert our national security policy in the Middle East.  And you, and people like you, which is most people (until they catch on) are a slave to consensus, meaning the fact that German and US interests have diverged so greatly on a political level that there's nothing left binding them together except ""business as usual.""

&gt; joint military efforts around the world, and cooperate with them on thousands of matters beyond the big-ticket disagreements you have fixated on.

This is token involvement though.  If Germany sends us a platoon of infantry to go chill on a base somewhere and reach out to the locals, that's great, but then they actively subvert our much broader national security/foreign policy, it completely negates that gesture.  Geopolitics cannot survive on pure gestures and convention.  Civil servants will inevitably, if left unchecked too long, put the art of diplomacy ahead of the business of diplomacy.  If you do have family in the foreign service, and you're intelligent, you will have noticed this at least on some level.  Just because they achieved those positions doesn't mean they deserved them, and seeing as American foreign policy has been a shambles for the past 20 years, it's more likely than not that they didn't.

&gt;And on many of those big ticket disagreements, the Germans hold positions that are either popular with Americans or were the stated foreign policy of the last several American administrations. You either didn't know this, or you're trying desperately to bury it in service to some insane anti-EU fervor.

See, what I'm doing is taking the way Europeans talk about the United States and turning it back on them.  I consider their anti-American fervor, from a political to a social level, to be the real problem here, and much more pervasive and dangerous to the status quo that you adore so much.  If Europeans continue to come into conflict with rational American policies, like protecting against Huawei or hemming in an expansionist Iran, they will be talked to not as allies but as representatives of a divergent, foreign, and self-interested agenda.  Diplomats' job is to get along with each other, and they're always the last to accept when it stops working.  I'm not saying we're there, but if the Germans don't back down (as they are the weaker party with more to lose) it will get to that point.  Germans just fail to see that they're acting out of self-interest, and think it's out of virtue and logic.

&gt; When we've rebuilt their economy from the ground up after WWII not only out of realpolitik Cold War selfish interests, but to build a lasting partnership where Germany was a bulwark of global order instead of the greatest threat to it? 

Yeah, we're not the ones who forgot about all that, the Germans are.  And it's not that they've forgotten it, there are still a huge number of German politicians who do get it, even in Merkel's party and their allies, and who have highlighted the insane, irrational anti-Americanism that dominates German politics.  What's a problem is that they don't seem to be able to do anything about this vocal minority, as it's becoming apparent they represent public sentiment better than the more rational voices, that Germans individually are hugely anti-American, and the media fuels that.

&gt;were the stated foreign policy of the last several American administrations.

That's not true.  The Bush administration took an entirely different line on Iran than Obama, much closer to the current one.  I mean, it's a lot of the same people, as you know if you have the foreign policy credentials you claim.  Obama is about an eight year blip, though only really four years of actual divergence, in an otherwise consistent US policy towards Iran since their revolution.  And the Europeans were all on board--they're the ones who have changed, not us, and we've got all these gullible, awestruck Americans over in Europe who are just sightseeing and eating up their European bullshit, so if the Europeans said current consensus  ",,/r/europe/comments/b2x41r/germany_us_ambassador_richard_grenell_should_be/eixpsd4/,the_end_of_memes,1553055612

84,"&gt;Of course people want higher taxes on other people, but not on themselves.

""A majority of Americans would [be willing to] pay higher taxes if it meant health insurance for everyone, according to a [2009] CBS News/New York Times poll...""

[Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-majority-would-pay-higher-taxes-for-universal-health-care/)

And national health programs are even more popular in Europe (and in America in 2018 vs 2009); I don't think there's a need to check whether the Brits would rather get rid of the NHS to lower their tax burden, for example.

These social welfare programs are a moral imperative and source of national pride for many people, and they are willing to increase their own taxes to fund them.

The reason why people are focusing on getting the rich to pay more in taxes is because most of the new wealth created by everyone's labor is going to the wealthiest individuals, corporations are making record profits while paying little to nothing in taxes, and yet normal people are told to accept austerity, as if we live in a situation of dire scarcity.

&gt;The sad reality is, higher taxes on the rich will mean they either move their businesses overseas, or jack up the prices to compensate for the loss the new higher taxes would inflict on them.

It's not all about taxes.  Businesses benefit from economies of scale (e.g., proximity to their suppliers, similar industries, and customers), government subsidies, an educated and healthy workforce, developed infrastructure, low corruption, favorable laws regarding things like trade and liability, etc.  Many of those things are made possible by higher taxes.

For the rich, higher taxes are, up to a certain point, just an inconvenience.  They'll pay more to live in a place like London or Paris, and in my country, rich people fill California despite its high taxes while avoiding low-tax Kansas.

It's more that the importation of migrants doesn't address the issue facing the indigenous people.

Sub-replacement fertility is a problem to two distinct groups: the state, and the people whose fertility is low. The importation of migrants fixes the problem for the state, because it has new people to tax, but it does not solve the problem for the people, whose number has not increased, but continues to decline on a long-term trajectory to extinction. The state lives on, taxing the migrants. But the people do not.

121,"&gt; Actually DMCA take-down notices are filed under penalty of perjury, but because studios did not like that risk, they lobbied youtube to change the takedown system to not be officially DMCA based. So yeah takedowns are a crapshoot atm.

Also, DCMA doesn't apply in the EU. It's a USA system.

&gt; Article 13(4) and the reticles lays out the principle by and large, © infringement should not happen; and crucially OCSSP's can be held liable for not doing enough.

Sigh. OCSSPs have _always_ been able to be held liable for copyright infringement on their platform. They have always had to rely on exceptions that allow them to negate that liability.

Article 13 gives such an exception. Take offline duplicate infringements. Easy job. No collateral damage possible, as any collateral damage would break the law and actually make you liable again. 

&gt; As for 13(5)/13(4), like it or not, one paragraph, is under penalty of civil liability from billion $ companies the other is not. Article13(5) does not expose youtube to civil liability, and even if it did; it would be from a less dangerous source than a 13(4) violation.

The EU only tells member states what to achieve, not how to achieve it. If the member states implement a watered down version of Article 13(5) that would result in it being broken all the time, ironically, member states would be liable for that and can be punished adequately. This is a principle enshrined into EU law longer than we have called the EU, the EU.  

Additionally, in those cases the directive receives ""direct effect"" meaning businesses will have to follow the directive directly. 

&gt; This is the EU, rules are written by industry.

Rules are written by legislators based on stakeholder dialogue. The dialogue is completely public and readily available. It includes _all_ stakeholders, including individual users not represented by associations. 

&gt; For your two examples, in only one of them is youtube exposed to any additional liability, which they will never intentionally do.

The only circumstances where they are liable is if they cannot prove they made a best effort, that is there is an effort that would've been better, or when they went overboard and started taking offline legitimate content.

Number 4, the US funnels billions of dollars into Europe for national defense to prevent Russia from infringing on other European countries sovereignty and yet they'd so easily allow themselves to become dependent on Russia for energy. It would be more insane if he hadn't called out Germany for this.

Number 5, despite Germany's promise to meet NATO spending requirements they reneged on their promises and fell well short. Again deciding to mooch off US generosity while continuing to criticize the US at every turn.

However, I will say I'm looking to Germany's actions (or lack of actions) as a strong signal about what the US should be doing over there. Point blank, if Germany doesn't seem concerned about things in their sphere of influence then I don't see why we should be concerned either. We've heard some pretty scary assertions in the press in the last few years and yet no one Europe seems to be doing any of the things you might think a country worried about their security would do.

So saying he is working only for billionaires is quite the exageration. Meanwhile the Carbon Tax has been the pipe dream of several environmentalists, his TV star turned environment minister included, since he was the champion of it. So yeah he may have been heavy handed, especially it wasn't the first increase of gaz price, but one of the main source of emission of GHG is still transportation.

Moreover, Macron is succeeding Holland, known for imposing heavy fiscal burden upon the middle class and higher earners, so of course Macron is releasing the tax burden in the heaviest or second heaviest taxed country in Europe. In the UK, the like of Boris Johnson were nudging the French under president Holland to settle the UK to flee the crazy high tax rates.

Basically it seems he is doing quite the lots of stuffs people wanted but has to pay the price because no one dared to do it before. When I read that the leader of Sarkozy's former party criticized Macron for his tax reforms, it was the pinacle of hypocrisy. Same for Holland who himself said he had been too harsh with the wealthiest and established a glass ceiling to avoid reaching ludicrous tax rates.  But when Macron is unrooting the cause, suddenly it is bad.

Your accusation of opening the floodgates and telling them to come to Germany refers to the German suspending of the Dublin II protocol.

It is that exact protocol which says that refugees should be deported internally to the country of first arrival.

So, you can't have it both. You can't both criticize Merkel for not deporting to countries of first arrival, and for  deporting to countries of first arrival.",,/r/europe/comments/b2x58j/germany_eligible_to_deport_refugees_to_eu/eiwkl2x/,10ebbor10,1553025759

They don't rely on eachother. In practice most telecom companies buy different products from different vendors in order to keep some bargaining power. The whole point of standardization is that it will still work if you mix components from different vendors. There can be still be differences in performance, but they all work with eachother. There are also a number of smaller, more specialized vendors who offer a more limited range of network components that you can turn to.

* A combination of tech filter with human counter checking works only so far and gets overwhelmed

* Technology to filter with ""hashed"" recognition fails badly when the people behind uploading material even try to play cat and mouse with this kind of tech. 

* Machine learning software is still a work in progress and still will be in 2 years (it's not new either)

559,"&gt;Again there was not a single Anatolian group.

Funny you say that, because we all know all Ancient Greeks were the same. Didn't millions in your country march on streets to claim a Macedonian as Greek? There were scattered states all across the peninsula and somehow they are all lumped into one Modern group we call Greeks. I am not even mentioning the slavic invasions, every modern Greek being actually Albanian etc. Discussing these would take ages.

A Turk in 19th century would define himself as Muslim, so it is very anachronistic to use modern national definitions of nations to refer to these people. What about the last Byzantine Emperor's Nephew? He converted to Islam and spoke Turkish only. He became a grand vizier and a famous commander in the Ottoman Army. Spoke Turkish, and was Muslim. He was a Turk then. This is absurd. 

You are very in favor of making a connection between ancient Greeks, who were scattered and definitely the least homogenous, and modern Greeks who have 0 cultural connections and of different genetics, simply because they all converted to Christianity. Do you know how easy it is to convert to Islam? Just a sentence, and you pay fewer taxes. Somehow, in Greek imagination, Anatolia was pure 100 percent Greek in one year, and then Turks came and killed all (population became zero for an instant) and then they were all Turks. This is absurd. As we in modern eras separated our countries based on religion and language (which are most definitely connected, as in if you are a Greek convert to Islam, you would speak Turkish), how come the same rule that applies to Turks? Science confirms this. When you look at the genotype of a modern Turk ( actually average, we have a lot of Balkan, slavic, circassian migrates), you find a high percentage of local Bronze age Anatolians (pre Macedonian invasion). This is just a proof that these locals were first hellenized (in culture only), and then muslimized, who formed the Modern Turkish nation because muslims + speaking Turkish counted as a Turk in 20th century.

No there's a woman from NI who identifies as solely Irish who has had the Home Office in court since 2015. And who has won--subject to appeal. That is what it might finally take for the govt to implement the terms it agreed to 20 years ago.

But you see the point, right? To object on the basis of legal/technical grounds is different to objecting on political grounds.

Hence I wanted to make the point that politically the interpretation of the Tories and DUP are but one interpretation. Not supported especially by the communities most affected by the outcome. 

I do recognise that the DUP are playing kingmakers. That's why I think a softer Brexit which is a compromise between Labour, SNP, LD, and Plaid, including Tory Remainers would be ideal.

based on personal experience so it is biased, I just don't like people that are against x, y, and z. Make personal of attacks on (I think ministers or local politicians in Amsterdam) and then pretend to be the victim, its untrustworthy for one. You never hear GroenLinks, D66, PVDA, CDA, VVD, PVDD whine about how unfairly the world is treating them, they actually stand for something (standing for Dutch values is a given and inane, pretending others do not is dishonest actually believing it, makes you and identitarian detached from reality). To some extend the PVV (in het past more so) and SP also do this but less. The most egregious thing to me is propagating conspiracy theories about MH17 and Putin admiration after 200 citizens were murdered (that is baffling). Not left wing, I tend to vote either PVDA or VVD depends on the people they have at that moment, I like Rutte as prime minister given the options (voted VVD last two elections, the promises they break are ironically exactly the ones I do not want them to keep).

782,"""What was retarded is that Trump and his fans used China to justify tariffs on the remainder of the world, including the EU.""

China has been dumping subsidized steel around the globe for decades and many countries have been forced to either find ways to subsidize their own steel industries or have let them go.  

In the US for example, in WWII we were the arsenal of democracy which is part of the reason why you are not either a NAZI or a Soviet today.  However, now the US steel industry is a shadow of what it once was and even when we decided that we needed to quickly up armor our HUMVEE's in Iraq we had to go out on the global market to get the correct steel.  

If we had put steel tariffs on China and just China then we still would have been flooded by the artificially cheap steel from other surviving sources.  Instead Trump took a global approach.

960,"&gt;These countries started out poorer and were devastated by WWII. In barely any case ""catching up"" worked, in most of these countries the shock therapy caused the economy to shrink.

Everywhere was devastated by World War II. Note the difference by 1990 between East and West Germany. As a bonus, compare that to today. As far as I know, Eastern Europe has made leaps and bounds since getting out from under the Soviet boot.

&gt;	China didn’t even dismantle their socialist sector, they just attracted foreign investment in SEZ.

China’s public sector doesn’t even qualify as socialized. Despite being state owned, none of the profits are even remotely distributed among the people. They‘re privately retained, which is what one would expect from a country with so many billionaires. It‘s a socialist market economy in name only; in reality it‘s straight up 1800s capitalism under a one party state masquerading as Marxist. But since everybody’s getting wealthy, nobody gives a shit. 

&gt;You mean undemocratically dissolved by the ruling clique 

Lmao what’s more undemocratic, occupying Eastern Europe and installing communist puppet regimes, followed by the brutal repression of dissent and the crushing of any attempts at democratization via invasion à la Czechoslovakia 1968 and Hungary 1956, or a continent wide popular revolution towards democracy? See the great thing is that people today are free to vote for communist parties all they like. Or they can enjoy liberal democracy without having to worry about being disappeared for their views.

&gt;Lancashire politics, Somerset politics

Depends on the issue

&gt;Welsh politics

Yeah, exactly. It's their issue, not yours. You being arbitrarily near it is irrelevant

I find this kid of attitude so hypocritical considering the introduction of EVEL, and Brexit. That English people are so enamoured by the UK that the feel the right to inject themselves into the lived-in realities of people in their neighbouring countries, asserts their feelings are as important as the real-world impacts of the residents of the effected areas, and the cry that it is wrong for peopel to be resentful about this.

You would not feel the same were it Germans getting involved in the politics of other EU members because of their identity, or Irish-Americans getting involved in Irish politics because of their identity. It is rank hypocrisy, and is *true* nationalism.

As I said, just because you apply a label to yourself, it does not mean it is your fight to have.

I'm so sick of constantly getting targetted on this board by the same 5 or 6 nationalistic English posters because I have had the audacity to assert a position on the *real world politics I have to live in*, and this offends their feelings.

I even think it may be an elaborate Coalition trap to harm her, because Bugar's measly few percent wouldn't make much of a difference, but the damage to Caputova's image could make a significant one...

Many have accused this govt of many un democratic practices. Any news story featuring the current leader, VUCIC was followed by clearly fake comments with things like ""wow what a leader"" and ""hes so great for Serbia"". And then there was the vote bribing occurring where people were paid with sandwiches to campaign and vote for VUCIC, then there was the threats to govt sectors peoples jobs, where they were threatened with unemployment if they did not pledge to vote for VUCIC. 

It all came to a climax when the leader of the opposition was beaten up ""randomly"" and left bloodied. Protests spilled out onto the streets and when VUCIC was asked about this he said that there was probably like 400 people out protesting in a city of almost 1.5 million. He said that the numbers looked larger becuase it was cold so people wore big puffy jackets. Which was absurd, its like he doesnt even care anymore. 

Why is this a big deal in Serbia though? Serbia had a dictator in the 90's called MILOSEVIC. He killed opposition leaders, closed down free press and stole elections. He was indicted for war crimes and overthrown in 2000 and handed over to the international community in 2001. He died awaiting sentencing in 2006 in the Netherlands. 

Serbs want democratic accountability, democratic institutions and freedom of press. I would rather burn down all of Serbia then let it be ruled by some quasi dictator again.

The decision about the future mobile network in Denmark comes after a significant public debate about the security risks of letting a chinese company be responsible for critical infrastructure in the country.

Defense minister Claus Hjorth Frederiksen has poiinted out a series of security challenges on the grounds of Huaweis connection to the chinese government, but he has also said that he sees no way to legislate against Huawei.

Administrative director Allison Kirkby underlines that the choice of Ericsson and the decision not to go with Huawei happened purely due to business concerns. The danish authorities have been involved with the security aspects of the choice of delivery of the 5G network but that is not uncommon.

”We are always in a running dialogue with the security services, because we run critical infrastructure. It is not only this process, but all we do” says Allison Kirkby.

She does not wish to inform us on the economic concerns with the two companies)Ericsson, Huawei) gave. 

Huawei have since 2013 built and run the 4G network for TDC in Denmark and shall continue to be responsible for a series of tasks for the telecommunications company. 

Huawei has in a letter to parliament underlined how Huawei follows all existing law in the countries in which they operate.

It is however not only Denmark but a list of countries that have had security debates surrounding Huawei. In the USA they have actually banned the sale of all Huawei products and the american foreign minister Mike Pompeo has openly warned european countries against doing business with the chinese firm.

&gt;**Q. What is the difference in combustion between a diesel engine and a petrol/gasoline engine?**   
A. In a **petrol/gasoline engine**, a mix of fuel and air is injected into the chamber. This is compressed and then ignited by a spark plug.   
In a **diesel engine** air is injected into the cylinder, and is compressed by around twice as much as in a petrol/gasoline engine. This compression generates heat, so that diesel fuel burns spontaneously when it is injected.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. Why do diesel engines produce more NOx than petrol engines?**  
A. Diesel engines operate at a higher temperature and pressure than petrol engines. These conditions favour the production of NOx gases. The quantity depends on the volume and duration of the hottest part of the flame.

This. The real reason why Orban is successful and has large support is because the opposition is utterly pathetic. In the opposition you have Gyurcsány (who was the PM of Hungary when the country was on the brink of economic collapse), MSZP (Gyurcsány's former party, ""reformed"" communists) and Jobbik (originally far right, ethno nationalist party that recently shifted to the centre, could be a viable alternative but its an unstable party with constant battles for leadership). And that's it, the rest are too small to be relevant.

&gt;Polish PIS also is hilarious case. Party that has almost the same stances as previous government but with slight bend to the right is somehow doing something ""wrong"".

**How?** By having rush hour a few hours early?

Just what is your plan here? Hope that people on the outskirts of the city can create enough of a traffic jam to prevent the suspect from leaving? A strategy of blocking him in with a bunch of other people is *not* going to end well! That (literally) puts more potential victims in his path.

People don't magically disappear, they all *go* somewhere. Making everyone 'leave' just forces everyone to shuffle around.

1584,"Depends.


There are some cases I'd regard as the EU puffing things up but actually has no proper legal basis to make demands. E.g. some EU agency signed a long-term lease for some expensive building in London but has now been relocated to somewhere else in the EU due to Brexit. Iirc they *wanted* the UK to pay for the rest of the lease but don't have a legal basis to make such a demand, so tough luck. 


- 


Otoh there are a couple of cases where your government has agreed to pay specific amounts into certain budgets. Those budgets are planned to cover the upcoming couple of years. So if your government has agreed in, say, 2014 (im pulling these numbers out of my arse btw) to a budget where the UK pays 10 million per year to [some EU entity] for 2016 to 2022 it's reasonable to expect the UK to keep up with that agreement because the entity receiving the budget relied on being assured of getting that budget. 


The UK later on deciding that nope, they don't want to pay what they committed to pay is the one deviating from the course of action previously agreed on hence it's the UK who should accept responsibility for smoothing out the difficulties their decision causes.

The EUs position is that the UK did infact agree to these budgets so the UK is bound to fulfil those commitments. The treaties do not offer a legal basis as to prematurely pull out of previously agreed on budget plans. That makes the plans for the UK to pull out like that more like a wish or a request towards the EU, not a lawful right. How to handle those budgets is therefore up to debate *as far as the EU is willing to discuss the matter*.


Practically speaking lots of things are possible matters of discussion but only as long as all parties are willing to discuss. In the end it's one big negotiation anyway. Unfortunately for the UK it's the EU who has the upper hand in that big negotiation because the repercussions of a no deal Brexit will hit the UK way worse than most of the EU, hence the EUs unwillingness to accomodate the UKs wishes more than necessary, especially with the negotiations as of yet not going smoothly at all. 


Crudely speaking the EU doesn't *force* you to agree to it's demands without any alternative. It just insists on its demands knowing that your other choice is a no-deal Brexit which would pose a way larger problem to the UK. Your government is painfully aware of this because otherwise they'd happily give the EU the finger while just going the no-deal route. They're not doing so because the no-deal route would fuck shit up a lot for the UK. 



...Like you literally need to import vast amounts of food to feed your population. Most of these imports come from the EU. A no deal Brexit could halt those imports completely. The situation for medicine is similar-ish insofar your supply of various medicines will run out sooner or later if you don't have at least one proper import-export treaty with any of the global manufacturing bases (mainly the EU and the US). Various industries dependant on international supply chains will run into problems as well, some more, some less.


It's not just a matter of being -in practice- capable of handling that stuff (like of course the production and logistics parts of getting EU-grown food to the UK 'could' just carry on like before) but also a matter of regulation and treaties. It seems to be somewhere between legally challenging and legally impossible to export anything without having a treaty in place (and the WTO base rules suck ass big time), even more so for anything in need of any kind of clearance, like hazardous materials. That includes any intermediate product which is e.g. flammable (like lots of chemicals dissolved in alcohol, like many food flavourings and other additives) or toxic, cancerogenous, etc. That stuff needs various certifications and permits to transport and trade, which also wouldn't be formally recognised by the EU in case of a no deal Brexit.

1631,"Very well. But a couple of points:

It's ridiculous to consider the EU 'arrogant'. It set out its 'negotiating position' as you like to call it, and it's acting consistent with that position. A position that is agreed by all the member states. And it is the union of 27 member states, behind a large and powerful market. In this negotiation the EU has all the leverage and holds all the cards. This is fact, not a matter of opinion or political rhetoric.

What is arrogant is to think that the desires of one nation should be more important than the interests of 27.

Likewise, the UK should not be so cavalier about no deal Brexit. It is like to destroy the UK internally. Look at Scotland and NI. 

The Scots were told that if they voted to stay in the UK in their Ref that they would stay in the EU. Turned out to be a lie. And now they're agitating for another Ref, and behind some significant economic downturn caused by Brexit, they could win it.

NI similarly voted 65% to remain. Despite the fact that DUP is the only political voice being heard from NI in Westminster, the DUP does not speak for NI. It does not represent the interests of anyone in NI who voted to Remain. And those people are putting huge pressure on the DUP, who are ignoring it willfully. This is not just the nationalists/Republicans/SF types, but unionist (small u) businesses whose livelihood is being threatened. 

Politically polling for a Unification Ref is not far from passing. All that would be needed is for those business owners and civil servants to conclude that they might have it better off in the Republic. To do that, you just need a little of the economic devastation that a hard Brexit might deliver.

They've also expressed, in about as strong terms, that they don't like the scenario of no deal, and that they don't like the scenario of no Brexit, and they don't like a bunch of other hypothetical deals which May didn't even propose to EU.

I'd interpret that as simply UK acknowledging that it doesn't like any of the possible options. UK is going to have to take one of the options they don't like, and they can't pick any of them - but it doesn't seem that they've actually expressed in any meaningful way that they'd definitely prefer no-deal than that deal; there definitely is a group that'd prefer that but they're a minority (as evidenced by the recent vote rejecting a no deal as an option), the majority wants *some* deal but don't consider May's deal as the best possible option - and even that seems to be changing.",,/r/europe/comments/b2kbvq/brexit_commons_speaker_rules_out_third_meaningful/eitqqwp/,Brudaks,1552939448

Although 50% of the UK want to leave the EU at least the vast majority of the UK politicians (including May) are very pro-EU. What I'm saying is that situation could soon change.

Crucially the Conservative party grass roots hate the EU and prefer no-deal Brexit by a mile. I can not overstate to you how pissed off these people are (I'm a local party member) over what they see as a stitch up. These are the people that decide who represents the Tory party for their constituency at elections. Those Tories working against Brexit? They are gone at the next election, the local party will select another candidate. Even people supporting May's hated deal - probably gone.

The Labour party is different. Most of the MPs and the party members are pro-EU and anti-Brexit. However it is the Labour heartlands where the voters are most anti-EU and voted for Brexit. Labour are going to get eviscerated at the next election in these seats. Farage's new brexit party, or the (newly purged) Tories are going to clean up.

1687,"To be clear though, whether or not something is a total war has nothing to do with the number of casualties alone. The examples you gave were all conventional pre-modern wars in areas with large populations. 

A total war represents the mobilisation of a whole people and economy to support a war effort. That was very rarely possible in the pre-industrial era, and only on small scales. The logistical support simply wasn’t there. You couldn’t manufacture arms, move troops, or store food on the scale required. Even raising troops was an order of magnitude harder, because 90% of the population was spread across susbsistence farms instead of being conveniently located in cities. 

In the examples you gave, most of the casualties came from armies killing subsistence farmers and creating famines (and in the Americas, spreading disease). The reason I was talking about smaller conflicts is that you can very easily see how the progression from limited wars to full blown total war as these relatively small states field as much manpower and resources as any Great Power would have been able to 100 years prior.

I reject nationalism, I am a British patriot, I don't blindly follow what my country is doing just because it's my country.

&gt;Surely they had 'roots' and 'interests' in keeping Ireland part of Britain? Or does it only work one way?

Yeah, because they were majority Scottish and English descendants, and Protestant. Many Irish were Catholic and were denied proper
political representation by virtue of their religion.

&gt;You know that was through decades of Scots campaigning that achieved that? It wasn't a gift from the UK. Jesus...

Which represents the fact that the UK didn't ignore Scotland or refer it to the margins.

&gt;Tables of power? WTF are you talking about? NATO, the UN and OSCE are not 'tables of power'. And the UK is doing a swell job of removing itself from the G7 through the nationalistic desires of the English population a la Brexit.

1 million Scots voted to leave out of a voting total of 2.6 million. And yes they are, they're major centers of international cooperation and influence.

&gt;You certainly act like it though. This entire exchange is a testiment to that.

No it isn't, your claim that the UK ignores Scotland is false.

&gt;Barely able to get over a quarter of the vote. The anti-Tory consensus in Scotland is too strong. They will never be a prevaling power in Scotland. Ever.
It is the Union that subjects us to the Tories, because that is who England votes for - and we are supposed to accept that because of English feelings of identity.

LOL, so Scottish Tories are not really Scottish now? 

&gt;Ask yourself what the actual difference is. Seriously. Outside of a sense of ownership of geography, what separates your 'Englishness' from your 'Britishness'? I'm sure you will say it is 'outward looking' like everyone always does, but that isn't a national identity, that is character trait.
What is the difference? Some Scotch kitsch that gets tacked on?

What separates my Englishness from my Britishness is that I'm not fully English. And what separates you from your Britishness is that you consider yourself fully Scottish.

&gt;No, I'm not. I am contesting your arrogant position to obsessively assert a position on a place you do not live, because it hurts your feelings not to.
You don't give a fuck about the people that live there, as long as your feelings don't get hurt. As long as your identity is intact.

You don't live in England, yet arrogantly assert that we all hate the Scottish and treat you with disdain. I am merely against your narrative that independence is the preferable outcome, because it would weaken both nations, it's ironic because all the positions you're placing on me can be inverted and accused against you.

&gt;Lol fuck off you nationalist cunt. I actually cant image being as selfish as you.

Yet you want independence regardless of the consequences. You're the biggest nationalist cunt going. 

&gt;You are literally inserting yourself into a debate that doesn't concern you because of your identity, and then saying that you 'consider [yourself] British first and foremost""

It does concern me, being British is a union of being Scottish and England, if Scotland goes, it hollows out my identity and I don't want that. Your feeble attempts to 'other' me because Scottish independence doesn't concern me, even though we both live on this island, is exactly the kind of attitude I resent from you and your like minded English nationalists.

&gt;If you want to ignore everything I say, then remember this one thing - and I mean this sincerly: it is the attitude that you are expressing right now that makes nearly half the voting population of Scotland want to leave the UK. Understand that well.

Notice how many interesting startups come out of Switzerland and Scandinavia, relative to their population? Their rich are forced to take more risk, because the wages are too high to do what the Germans are doing.

The financial crisis 2009 would have been less severe for southern Europe, since the Euro would undergo stronger devaluation. And the DM would appreciate in value (not as much as the CHF did, but the reason would be the same -- scared capital moving to stable currency).

Average Germans would be able to afford more, the economy could cater more to the domestic market.  Any investment outside Germany would be easier for Germans than it is now. (Kinda like how regular Scandinavians and Swiss are can afford apartments in great locations nowadays.)

1825,"&gt;Ultimately, the goal is to create a 200,000 hectare area of ecological conservation in Europe equivalent to the likes of Yellowstone or Yosemite in America.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently, there are 300 national parks in Europe, but none are as universally recognised as Yellowstone in the US or the Serengeti in Tanzania.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Although the proposed national park would be about half the size of Europe’s current largest national park (Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer in Germany) that park is mostly sea, and inaccessible. The Fagaras Mountains park would be much more accessible than that park, easily allowing it to make a huge impact on the locality.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The area already has an outstanding collection of native fauna including bears, lynx, wolves, red deer, chamois (a European mountain goat), boar, and golden eagles. The only animal in need of reintroduction to the area is the European bison. There are plans to have the first group of these animals placed into the national park by 2019.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s also a huge potential for eco-tourism in the area.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;To that end, the FCC is developing the facilities necessary to bring tourists to the region. These include a ranger station, an information centre, wildlife hides and lodges, education and outreach centres, and campgrounds for tourists.

are people from Asia British?  
are people from India and Pakistan British?  
are people from the Caribbean and Africa British?  
are people from the middle east British?  


we can easily identify 99% of the worlds population as being decidedly not of British blood, i really don't think the level of resolution you're trying use is worthwhile, it's pedantic and designed to obfuscate the larger problem and what the conversation is focusing on.   


like i said and coming back to reality, no one is trying to kick anyone out, no one is trying to completely stop immigration as a whole, by that metric just maintain the demographic you already have, you don't need to figure out who is and who isn't british down to the last drop of blood if that is what you are trying to do.  


you do realize the stupid and pedantic point you're trying to make can even be applied to my native peoples right? we all walked here across the land bridge and then started killing each other, there are no original tribes, they were all wiped out by other tribes, assimilated, and rinse and repeat until you have the tribal nations we recognize today, by the metric you're trying to use there are no navjo or choctaw people, even less so if you consider what happened when all the white people came here and killed all of the smaller tribes and forced them into the larger nations....by the metric you want to set, my people don't actually exist...and really nobodies does, all peoples are nothing more than a product of war and assimilation.   


why split hairs when we're talking about shaving a dog? it's stupid, small minded and focuses on a tree when we're talking about a forest...there's lots of instances where using a to fine of a resolution become worthless.

You can face the court but not face justice, what's so hard to understand about that concept. Think how many mobsters got away like that back in the day, especially in the states.

&gt;Let me guess, you take Bridge on Drina as a historical work and Noz by Draskovic as well. Books written by individuals are not evidence. But you can use that book to look for evidence. Which you didn't find. 

What's the problem with Bridge on the Drina, it's quite a fine book. I wouldn't take every part of it as a historical event but it to me it seems like a good presentation of the general times of back then. And I've never read Nož so I can't say anything about it.

I was referring to a back I heard/read about some time ago, written by one of Naser's soldiers. It's pretty much an eyewitness account.

But there are some figures that do hold up to international comparison that cannot be influenced by legalese. Like how [Poland has 194 prisoners for every 100.000 people](http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison_population_rate?field_region_taxonomy_tid=14), while Sweden has 59.

2144,"Propaganda vs Propaganda, who will win!?

&gt;2014 saw a myriad of Ukraine-related falsehoods coming from the Kremlin and the media it controls.

&gt;First, in March that year, the “little green men” in Crimea were unmasked as Russian military. Later in the spring, people in the allegedly local militias in eastern Ukraine also turned out to be soldiers deployed from Russia. When the summer came, and Russian troops shot down a civilian airliner over eastern Ukraine, Moscow again decided not to tell the truth, opting for multiple and contradictory “theories” about what had happened.


So, the ""falsehood"" that this virtuous article explores is ironic because they display the same attributes of propaganda, too. 

Let's take a look. The comment I quoted above. It's scary for those reading it. It incites raw emotions, but what this article conveniently left out is that Russian presence was legal through an internationally recognized agreement know as the [black sea fleet agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_Treaty_on_the_Status_and_Conditions_of_the_Black_Sea_Fleet)

So, they try to convince you of Russia's propaganda by using propaganda of their own by employing half-truths. 

&gt;For the last five years, Kremlin-loyal Russian media has promoted a narrative about how Crimea’s annexation is gradually becoming accepted and the peninsula’s status “normalised.”

&gt;But Alexander Morozov disagrees with this narrative. On the contrary, he sees Crimea as a persisting problem for Russia: “Crimea is a poison that has continuously been injected for five years in small doses into the body of the whole system of Russian education, culture and the entire system of argumentation over national identity,” he writes, and continues: “We have to continually invent, distribute and discuss on talk shows the various ‘arguments of lies’ that justify Crimea. This lie must be incorporated in school textbooks, in film plots, in the system of legal education of bureaucrats, in all the pores and gaps of the social space. Society […] cannot admit that it participated in the attempt to divide Ukraine,” Morozov argues

Carefully chosen talking heads, which don't represent the government or the people but rather the message of the article. 

No one in Russia feels this way and no one in Crimea feels this way. The narrative that the Crimean annexation has been normalized is absolutely true. Cherry-picking one person does not disprove that. 

Blatant propaganda.

Like for stuff like film, art, music, movies, tech (to a degree) and what not it's great and we get a slice of their culture which is there to be enjoyed, oftentimes being made into our own domestic equivalent subcultures. As for stuff like their specific strain of ideological, racial and religious politics, I feel like this is where problems arise, due mainly to the fact that they don't mesh well with our individual European country dynamics. Our issues are uniquely individual to each European country and American issues that our oftentimes brought offer in an attempt to supplant our own, are inapplicable to these unique circumstances and more often than not do more damage than good.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the rise of the internets reach has aided in further dissemination of all aspects of Americana to our side, even more so than before. In Ireland in particular you have people with LA accents in South Dublin, traditional conservatives with inflated notions pumped by money and support of American evangelicals, nut job politicians who parrot the rantings of Alex Jones, people conflating all sorts of American domestic political ideologies and thinking that they can work as direct parallels to our own. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the benefits are great in terms of creative output but the negatives are extremely tiresome and can oftentimes only feed into the divisiveness of a particular domestic situation. Not to mention American economic practices of practically unregulated free market allowing for giant corporations of Facebook, Google and Airbnb to get up to all sorts, including lobbying our own government ministers with shady deals akin to Shell and the Corrib gas situation. That and pricing everyone out of Dublin, with more severe gentrification that that of NY and some of the highest rental prices in the world.

Why Russia pays off Soviet debt alone

&gt; Initially, it was assumed the USSR's foreign debt would be paid by all its republics. A document on this was to be signed in December 1991. The bulk of the debt was on Russia (61.34 percent). Ukraine was to repay 16.37 percent, and Belarus was to repay 4.13 percent.

&gt; However, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan did not sign the agreement. As a result, in 1994 Russia took on all the debt in exchange for property all around the former Soviet Union.

2428,"So, I think that the problem there is different — it's that trying to put a value on economic production in a non-market economy is hard.

It's not just that some of the data was bad and some of it was not public.  It's...what is the dollar value of a loaf of bread?  In a market system, it has a price tag, and that price measures the resources that were put into it.  But when you system fundamentally doesn't work like that, everything acts as it's subsidized or taxed to some unknown degree.  There just isn't that common reference point.

I was reading this paper from the '90s or so, and it was comparing Soviet GDP estimates from different sources (scholars, CIA, etc) during the Cold War.  All over the map.

But for Ukraine and for the CIA in the case I was talking about, the issue is more trying to forecast political moves, and in this case two decades down the road.  I figure that that's a hard call to make.  I mean, if you were asked what the leadership of most countries are gonna be doing in 2040, could you say?  Like, who is gonna declare war on whom?

Usually, countries will not take actions that produce a situation in which they lose a war (""Can I get away with invading Kuwait?  Probably!  Oh, damn!""), so you'd think that one party would normally back off from an action that would produce war in most cases.  So a war tends to mean that *someone* screwed up in their estimate of what someone else would do.  Wars happen, so bad estimates happen, and that's without having to look decades down the road.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b29thq/tomorrow_vladimir_putin_is_going_to_open_a_power/eis63nl/,vokegaf,1552883497

I seriously doubt that. Even between France and Germany, as the closest EU partners, the strategies, traditions and interests differ widely. 

If the US drops its security umbrella position tomorrow Europe will splinter the day after into blocks and eventually even further. Also start working against eatch other more as is today. Only a possible big outside thread could temporarily forge a cooperation.

2559,"&gt;Rating countries by unemployment rate is difficult because in many cases people who only work a few hours and are seriously underemployed do not count as unemployed.

While that's true, since all countries measure unemployment the same way, the results are pretty comparable.


&gt; Going by the GDP (PPP) is a more accurate measure of a countries wealth and the economic well being of its citizens. 

No; GDP is just the value of goods and services produced by a country. It doesn't tell you anything about personal well being, and adjusting it for PPP doesn't make any sense. 

Using GDP PPP *per capita* is more accurate than unemployment, maybe. Although the problem with using GDP per capita is that the GDP isn't spread evenly across the country...and this is particularly true in Ireland, where profits made by corporations based in Ireland are included as part of Ireland's GDP, but don't really end up in the pockets of individual workers. (The same is true in Norway, where the significant oil wealth adds more to the GDP than it does to salaries).

People often use GDP per capita as a proxy for income because it's easy to calculate and sort of close for larger countries with diversified economies.

The best measure, of course, is PPP-adjusted income. Which is sometimes hard to get for some countries. 

The OECD uses the [better life index](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/11111111111), which is pretty comprehensive. But it's also not something that can be reduced to one number. ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b23qq3/happy_stpatricks_day_from_ireland/eiry7v4/,thewimsey,1552876046

It is disturbing that some people have forgotten the 00s...

This is not the Government's policy, it is the central bank.   
They know the masses would love to 'get on da ladder' with a 115% mortgage like it is 2007. But the central bank knows that will only create issues in the long run. 

Allowing banks to give out bigger mortgages, will just push up house prices and not make anyone better off. But sure everyone is an economist when it comes to housing in Ireland...

They also dislike that we will copy your regulations which essentially still means the commission has the ability to alter Britain’s trade regulations. Theresa May’s deal also prevents independent trade deals. Also the European Parliament still controls our VAT rate while the ECJ still has control over trade and commerce matters.

2795,"&gt;As far as I know, 400 000 Serbs killed by Ustaše is the number most well supported by evidence. It's a very minor nitpick though, both numbers are mindnumbigly atrocious. 

I think it's either 300k-350k or 500-600k. There was that one extensive study by two historians that used pretty much the same methods with both getting a death toll of around 300-350k. But apparently they made error when looking at expected population growth, using the Yugoslavia wide growth percentage of 1,1%, when the growth of Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia was a ways higher, at something like 2,4% or 2,7% (can't remember correctly). Correcting that mistake apparently gets a number in the 500-600k range, closer to the later number.

Also, while extremely horrific, it's simply not as bad as 1 million.

&gt;On a secondary note, seeing your country tag, I'd like to ask you if Serbs are aware of the ethnic cleansing the rebel Serbs did in Croatia in 1991? I was wondering about that, since I don't think I ever heard Serbs acknowledge it. 

I don't think most people ever think of that outside of the ever famous Vukovar. Truth be told I feel like events outside of Vukovar and Oluja as a whole are sparsely thought of. That's my feeling, someone else might feel differently.

I'm going to copy and paste a comment from a second ago that addresses this exact argument. 

We are not unsustainable. This is a myth. Worldwide, our population is unsustainable and still growing at an uncontrollable rate. In the west our population is naturally shrinking to sustainable levels.

The only reason people can keep arguing our population is unsustainable is all the people we've brought in to offset our shrinking population makes it look like native European population is growing. In reality it is not. As you can see, our fertility rate is far below the 2.0 required for replacement level.

We are not unsustainable, our governments are making us unsustainable to prop up the economy.

Prague is infinitely more beautiful. If they invest less it's mostly because they have a lot less ugly stuff to fix.

&gt; The funny thing is not that you picked the poorest district of Warsaw, but also the one that attracts a ton of investment and gentrification akin to Berlin’s Kreuzberg - it’s becoming a hipster paradise

Indeed, but there are still years away before this transformation is fully complete. More fundamentally, it doesn't detract from my wider point that there are still huge neighbourhoods like Tarchomin which still need to be fixed but are unlikely to be so simply because they provide plenty of cheap housing and replacing all that housing stock and doing proper urban planning would take decades. So the city is stuck with them like a sore thumb. 

Furthermore, the car-centric urban planning, ridicolously vast/wide open ""dead"" spaces and the try-hard imitration of 3rd tier North American cities more generally is also something you have failed to adress, which many others brought up in this thread.

2836,"Game of chicken from the game theory is a simplified model based on messier real world interactions. Requirement of known and symmetric ordering almost never happens in the real world.

&gt; I am fairly sure that the UK's preference ordering goes ""Retain Northern Ireland and get a trade deal"" as first pick, then ""Retain Northern Ireland only"", then ""Trade deal only"", then ""Nothing"".

This is pretty critical but also debatable assumption. 

Part of the (real world) game of chicken is that each side is trying to convince the other side that they are actually not playing a game of chicken - i.e. that the collision (hard brexit) is preferable to chickening out (backstop for UK, not insisting on backstop for EU) even if it's not actually true. The point is that preference order is intentionally kept hidden to increase your chances of the other side chickening out:

You keep saying the filters that for practical reason become mandatory, won't block legal content. Today, while such filter are voluntary they already block legal content. Forcing websites to use them under penalty of liability will not in any way shape of form reduce their prevalence or false positives, rather the opposite. 

No website is going to risk a million $/€ lawsuit form a film/tv/music studio, hoping they can rely on A13(5) in court. Sites will amp up the filters and if anyone tries to complain about a13(5) they will simply say they are doing what is necessary to comply with  A13(4). The notion that sites can safely and without fear *reduce* filtering as you have suggested is delusional.

&gt; The average annual income in North Korea according to a 2013 estimate, is thought be $1,000 to $2,000

South Korea income: 
&gt; The average annual income income in South Korea is USD $21600

I know which country I would rather live in.

I will ask again, please get your facts correct and read these articles. Also malnutrition isn’t a problem in Western Europe, we don’t live in a 3rd world country like North Korea.

3025,"&gt; By this assertion you yourself cannot be sure that 'the country is destined for long term economic underperformance'?

My assertions are not even remotely contradictory, the mathematician in me wonders what you mean by the duality inherent since, to my eyes, there isn't one. I'm not saying that there's no chance that the uk underperforms in the long run, simply that no one knows. And basing long term forecast upon short term impacts is tenuous at best. 

&gt;Again, by your assertion you cannot claim, in hindsight, to know the economic impact of not joining the Euro for those countries.


Although no one can know for sure what impact no joining the euro would have had, the periphery economies would have certainly had more monetary tools (i.e. the most important ones) at their disposal when the debt crisis hit. The countries would also, almost certainly, be more competitive with their own currency which could only help.

3094,"A huge deal of British thought, art, culture and philosophy comes from a revivification of Ancient Greece and Rome among our intellectuals throughout the centuries. The very nature of our democracy, moral philosophy, conceptualisation of empire etc. It's a similar story for much of Europe but Britain in particular was deeply curious.

Even architecture, go to Oxford and see the [Ashmolean Museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashmolean_Museum) for a fantastic day trip and you'll see all kinds of evidence of the deep respect our academic, artistic and political classes had for ancient civilisation - especially at the time of the modern British nation coming into fruition. The building itself (1800s) is of a neo-classical design with big columns, it isn't just some coincidence it looks that way!

Ancient Greece was woven into the fabric of Enlightenment Britain. You maybe don't see it superficially today but scratch below the surface and look at our not so distant past and we used to be *far* more explicit in such things.

Now we just teach our kids about Greeks and Romans being funny people with odd hats, I find it quite a travesty that we don't impress more regularly just how important these civilisations were to our own. We've become so cynical and self-loathing - we don't even know what we are anymore or how to conceptualise where we sit historically.",Scotland: Weltschmerz,/r/europe/comments/b1vvxg/even_the_economist_is_losing_its_composure_over/eiql3el/,popeiscool,1552838907

3099,"&gt; While I agree with the sentiment the problem is that there's no real alternative yet. In a few years, sure, we are getting there, but raising taxes right now would not accomplish much. The hauling companies paying higher operating costs or the consumer are not the same ones innovating.

Ships and trains are alternatives.

Whilst there aren't alternatives yet for powering road freight specifically, the goal of getting goods between producers and to consumers can be reached whilst chopping percentages off the total harm caused to populations. Those percentages can both improve and save thousands of lives.

Newer trucks will be more efficient - replace the oldest a little sooner. Using more but smaller warehouses or production facilities may reduce the total transport required. If we extend taxes to low emissions zones, transport can be routed away from dense populations. The use of rail freight can be extended to the next-lightest goods where it's not already economical, and to the next-longest journeys. Nearer but smaller ports may be used, perhaps with longer journey times.

All of these things will be driven by relative prices. A slightly longer journey time might require more working capital, but be compensated for by the saving in high-tax fuel costs. Adding an extra warehouse might cost more, but if fuel is expensive enough it might be worth it. A second assembly/packaging facility in Western Europe might cost more than the one in the East, but it'd save fuel.

The basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the ""average"") is that it is not skewed so much by extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a ""typical"" value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets which vary greatly, a mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values.

3214,"Sure.

The UK leaving is weakening the EU. That it will be way worse for the UK provides me with 0 satisfaction and helps nobody (in Europe).

Meanwhile Putin is having a party.

But on the slightly up side. Let's remember that while the UK leaves the EU as a full member, it doesn't actually LEAVE. It's not starting it's engines and leave for outer space. It'll still be a european nation. Still trade with the same nations and still share concerns about security and defense. None of the fundamentals actually change.

I predict that any variant of Brexit will end up as a soft Brexit eventually. Whether there is a big last-minute Brexit deal or a flurry of hasty agreements after a no-deal Brexit - the end result will still be close cooperation and tight trade agreements. UK will not suddenly make most if it's trade with Peru.

Leavers will find out that they can't leave reality. 

UK will be greatly affected by EU decisions that they no longer have a vote in - which makes all if this so stupid. And it will needlessly suffer some financial losses and possibly loose Scotland to independence.

The while thing is stupid, but it might end up strengthening the EU. It already dampened the rhetoric of several eurosceptic parties in the EU.

At the end of the day, either membership in the EU is a net benefit. Then the UK will suffer from loosing that net benefit and weaken anti-EU arguments.

Or (unlikely IMHO, but time will tell), it's not actually a net benefit, then the UK is doing us all a favour by proving that and we can dissolve the EU in a decade or 2.",,/r/europe/comments/b1xmlx/royal_mail_missed_delivery_seen_in_london/eiq47k5/,Oerthling,1552823634

3308,"&gt; Because fracking gas is identical to normal gas. You have to treat it the same. That's the point. 

No, chemical identity does not make it the same. It is without a problem to have different regulations depending on the way the stuff was recovered. If not, alot of regulations and limitations in regards to import of meat that was produced with animal cruelty would be illegal as well.

As long as the regulation are the same for everyone, the WTO is happy, and if the regulations differenciate between production methods, than it is okay as well, no matter if the product differenciates.

And it is also not a violation of GATT for fuck's sake for the same reason it is not a violation of the WTO. GATT has the most favourable regulation demand. This means, when you give one nation a benefit and not another, that is a violation of GATT. BUT again, having different regulations for stuff depending on production methods are also legally okay as long as they are valid for every nation. It would be a violation of GATT if we would allow fracking gas come from Canada, but not from the US:

3312,"&gt; And that’s precisely why it’s failing.

No, it's because the people currently can't make demands in France, since the assembly is filled with people who disagree with them, the government is only disolvable by Macron and the assembly, and only the assembly can fire Macron (and only if they can make the case that it's ""haute trahison"", which some argue he did with anti-constitutional actions) 

De Gaulle, who kinda fathered the fifth republic, never intended for the president to hunker down like that, it's visible to how he reacted in similar circumstances. He disolved the assembly so people could express themselves (a winning bet, he got the majority again) and called for a referendum. When he saw he hadn't the public's support, he demissionned

The problem is that politician in France are a few class under what he thought would happen. Macron shamelesly holds on to power, even if he had like 20% support during the election, and probably a lot less now. 

That's why the movement continue, it's a deadlock. It's not failing anymore than at its start, but well, I don't really expect you to get it since you don't seem familiar with French politics...

The Maharaja had plans to let the country recover from its previous wars, but the defeated Bahmanid Sultan had other plans. With the help of foreign diplomats he convinced rulers from near and far to join against our kingdom. But our spies were dilligent and we had some friends on the inside. 

There was still a 7 year truce left and of course we were going to honour it, but that didn't mean we couldn't cause harm either way. 

As the Timurid Empire was supposed to join against us, our allies in Mewar and Delhi were instructed to secure the mountain passes and forts to the west, and Mewar did us another favour by vassalising the Gujarat Sultanate and actually declared on the Bahmanid Sultante, because in order to keep their secrecy Bahmanis hadn't confirmed their alliances. The Orissan Kingdom also saw there chance and declared on Bahmanis. Facing a two front war, he hired all the mercenaries he could but that ultimately lead to his bankruptcy and his end.

This put a major wrench into the plans of our foes, and other Kingdoms saw their chance and declared on the Timurid Empire. Delhi was also itching to further secure their Mountain pass and urged us to join. We honoured our call, while Delhi was laying siege to the Afghan mountain forts the Vijayanagara armies occupied the Bengali Capital and forced them out of the war. Than our 40.000 men joined the Delhian army and the Timurid ruler saw no chance of defeating this mighty force and unconditionally surrendered, without fighting a single battle against us as he was still busy with his other opponents.

We then turned our focus on the instigator of all our troubles again, and in a quick war further weakened the Bahmanid Sultanate, taking the rich city of Bijapur in the process. This city turned out to be a real treasure, as a new way of thought had develope there and was spreading to the surrounding countries, so our Maharaja increased the efforts of the spreading the so called renaissance and finally it was embraced in our lands.

Then tragedy struck our lands Kingdom: The Heir died while our King was approaching his 70s. A new heir was quickly determined but his qualities were very lacking. A surgent Tamil Noble who had grown a large powerbase in the southern parts of our Kingdom saw this as an opportunity to claim the Kingdom for himself and gathered a large force to support his claim. It seemed the army was on his side as they opened the gates of all the forts and never engaged in battle. After 2 years he entered the Capital, but by this time the old and venerable Maharaja Devaraya II Sangama had already died and a regency council put in place, who then quickly crowned this pretender as our new ruler.

3608,"&gt; Sure, bud. Anecdotal evidence trumps all, right?

Knowledge trumps all. Definitely trumps your random assertions, based literally on nothing.

&gt; The National Alliance Party is considered far-right. 

Where exactly is it considered to be far-right? Definitely not in Latvia. They have been represented in the Parliament and been part of the coalition government for years now. The fact that they’re anti-immigration does not prove anything and is mainly based in the historical experience of Latvia with forced mass migration from other Soviet republics. There might be some crazies that talk about cultural Marxism but definitely none of the MPs or even candidates. 

&gt; 'After a ban on symbols similar to the Nazi swastika or the Soviet hammer and sickle in 2003, members of the organization protested outside the Latvian parliament with ethnographic symbols bearing reversed versions of the swastika associated with the Nazi regime.'

I honestly don’t remember that but they were young, radical and stupid. The party does not really exist anymore, nor are the previous members of it expressing anything remotely radical today. 

The symbol debate is really tricky tho because the firecross is an ancient Latvian symbol, embedded in Latvian traditional culture. It’s in traditional dress, in jewellery, even buildings. When you see it in Latvia, it’s not the swastika, it’s the firecross. 

I am quite surprised that you’d fight me on this tho. Like, I know the issues we have. But I’ve also seen what far right looks like - back when I lived in the UK for uni. What we have here is not far right, not even close. And I saw what ignorant left looks like.

To be honest, I really don’t care about this debate. I can’t see how someone in their right mind deny the horrific things the Nazis did and try to refute how inhumane and degrading the Soviet system was to the people who had to live in it. Saying that one of those was better or worse doesn’t do any good, it doesn’t promote any understanding of the complexities of history. All it does is give an excuse to defend one of the sides and pretend that the horror of one side somehow justifies the horrors committed by the others.

Ehh I expected more. Missed authoritarianism and nativism. Also, Euroscepticism, protectionism, anti-elitism, etc. 

I’ll take a look at the articles you’ve linked to but I really do want to give you a tiny bit of advice - if you actually want to understand the politics, the ideologies and the views of people and parties, try to get rid of your -isms and blanket statements and instead look at the history of what has lead to this day. Seeing Marxism everywhere is a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to many who just mere 28 years ago lived under it. Anti-immigration is a reaction to the prevalent fear in the population - not of the “Muslims” or whatever you’d assume but of immigration as a force that nearly destroyed the fabric of the nation years before. I’m not sure if you’re actually interested in understanding these views but.. I tried to do my part.

3796,"It'a a very weak article:

&gt;In medieval Sicily, Christians, Muslims and Jews were “living and working together side by side,” Sturtevant said.

Yes. But Sicily is a remote end of Europe and a fairly small place, and you can hardly conclude based on Sicily that Europe in it's entirety was ""multicultural"" or whatever the implication is.

To me it is entirely normal that the ""edges"" of a civilizational area will be more mixed.

&gt;In 7th-century England, the well-respected archbishop of Canterbury was from Turkey, and his favorite abbot was from North Africa.

Really weird sentence because surely the author must be aware there were more than one archbishop in a century? Or it it the implication that there was only one well-respected one?

I think she means Theodore of Tarsus, who was Greek Byzantine as I guessed. Rhis guy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_of_Tarsus

It's really weird journalists always think Byzantines are Turks. Learn to use wikipedia, dammit! You're journalists, you should do the wikipedia thing!

His abbot, I think she means this guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_of_Canterbury

Adrian of Canterbury was indeed a Berber from north Africa. I assume though that he was a Christian refugee, Algeria was conquered by the Muslims around this period.

As far as I know there nobody in the Middle Ages put any importance on skin color, whereas for the Medievals, being Muslim meant you were going straight to hell :) So not strange at all with North African abbots, it was Christian untill the Muslim conquest. There must be many more, also Egyptians.

&gt;There were Ethiopian embassies across southern Europe, including Rome. 

I guess true - Ethiopia was one of the earliest countries to become Christian. Later on Eurrope lost contact with Ethiopia and it became the stuff of legends.

That Ethiopia has embassies, surely this does not mean Europe was multieethnic, the same way that North Korea is not a multiethnic country, because there are embassies in North Korea.

&gt;Medieval European artists also accurately depicted black people (read: not like blackface caricatures), indicating it wasn’t uncommon to see them. (Check out the Twitter account @medievalPOC for numerous examples.)

Chiang was so bad that in spite of Mao's massacres and horrible policies, life expectancy and public health greatly increased in China under Mao.

Men who killed hundreds of thousands, conquered and subjugated their enemies and destroyed anyone who stood in their way. Hell, in Mongolia they still venerate fucking Genghis Khan. None of these people deserve to be praised or held aloft as heroes, they most fucking certainly were not, but there is such a thing as proportionality. Napoleon was in many ways a bad man but he also favored freedom over sefdom, equality over nobility (well, for everyone who wasn't him and his oh so great Imperial family), an easily understood law for the people rather than an obtuse tool for the upper classes to dominate the lower, he wanted proper education and yada yada. Hitler's claim to fame is going out of his way to exterminate groups of people he hated, or just taking their lands and exiling them so that his beloved Ubermensch would no longer have to live with what he saw as human vermin.

When I said that any dead body, no matter if protestant or policemen, is too much ... he muted me.

4029,"Job market in Spain sucks. Those who are not unemployed work a lot of hours and salaries are not that high.

But it's true that you can do more things in Spain for less money and it becomes more obvious compared to more northern countries. In some countries even though wages are higher life is worse in general, weather, food and social interaction with other people. In Spain it is easier to chat with other people due to the friendly culture and a ton of things that makes Spain a really good place. 

I must say the worst part about Spain is lots of working hours and low wages. But everything else is quite good, really.

And I have appreciated it after I moved to another country that is supposed to be ""the best"", there I realize that Spaniards themselves don't know how lucky they are in some aspects. Of course in regard of work they are not.

4039,"Exactly what do you mean by this? Yes, freedom comes with risks and costs to society. That is true for every freedom you enjoy.

Switzerland (and the Czech Republic which had its first mass shooting in 2015) recogonized that it was a statistical anomaly. Rather than massively infringing on rights (gun ownership is a right in Switzerland) it improved the mental health system. The Czech Republic itself rejected the EU firearms directive that bans the most commonly-owned magazine and filed a lawsuit. The left wanted to pass more gun control in Switzerland in 2011, and the voters overwhelmingly rejected it, whereas if such a referendum was held in Germany or the UK, it'd pass easily.

My point is that there is just no balance whatsoever in practice. It doesn't matter if your gun homicide rate is lower than Australia, or that there hasn't been a mass murder of any kind since 2001. The authoritarians will always find an excuse to pass more and more restrictions without end whenever they can.

4064,"Ah, I'm certain we did. But it's not that simple.

That page or ""concept"" in Spanish sort of exists in Spanish Wikipedia, only that it's been decide that it'll do under [catalan nationalism](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacionalismo_catal%C3%A1n) —as in if anyone feels like they pertain to the ""catalan people"", it means that they are ""catalan nationalists"". If you search [""catalan""](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catal%C3%A1n), it brings you the chance of hitting either ""Catalonia"" or ""pueblo catalán"", but the latter simply redirects to the same ""Catalonia"" article that describes Catalonia as any other autonomous community —with it's history, details, etc, but never recognising anything outside the Spanish context.

Which is  actually hilarious as we are in the Spanish Constitution as an ""historical nationality"". They cover that in the ""[regionalismo y nacionalismo en España""](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regionalismo_y_nacionalismo_en_Espa%C3%B1a) page.

Interestingly enough, they do have a page for the [basque etnia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etnia_vasca), but I think it's the only one from all the other people in the iberian peninsula. In Catalan Wikipedia, you can find all the other cultures and ethnicities.

But then you have the [pueblo español](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_espa%C3%B1ol), ""Spaniards"" in English Wikipedia, with an historical background that goes 40k years back, and appropiating themselves of people who spoke, were and felt primarily Catalan, like Gaudí or Pau Casals for an example ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

&gt;Instead of fighting amongst each other, a bunch of people in this thread could get together and help make it. 

As the other user explained already, each Wikipedia has it's own internal people and rulings. They have discussions now and then that can make for some big changes, but when it comes to controversial topics, language rules.

That's why, in this case, it's interesting to point out that we exist in 40 languages but not in Spanish, because it shows how there's an interpretation of reality that 40 languages share, and then the Spanish one.

That also explains, btw, the reason behind the Catalan Wikipedia being so big, and there being an urgency of creating it back in the day. That's where we are and have been putting the work, doing it by ourselves, because we know that there're many people (that outnumber us by a factor of 20) that will put their own work to deny our existance.

If we could convince them to let us exist in Wikipedia, it could mean that we could to IRL, politically. But in the same fashion we can't over the internet, we can't politically either —and hence the current state of things in the country.

It's not as if we haven't tried.

If, for example, Russia wants to invade Europe, than Ramstein will not be able to do anything, it would still take massive deployment from the US, during which time half of Europe might be conquered.

Ramstein exist to contribute the US's interest. That said, Germany has an interest to still have these bases here, as it means a thight dependency between the US and Germany.

German politics is about creating mutual dependencies. The US won't fuck too hard with Germany (and thus, the EU) if Germany has still a card in its hand that would cause a massive blow to the US. At the same time, Germany don't shut these things down because it would mean economic and political retribution.

Same tactic with Russia. Germany knows that, if they stop buying gas from Russia, their economy would tank. This is one of the last life-lines that prevents Russia from complete economic collaps, and the time to reconstruct Russia's infrastructure to sell the gas to China would be too long. On the other hand, Germany has a dependency on Russia for said gas. If one side dicides to lock this off, both will suffer hard. Because of that, Germany is still able to have some influence over Russia.

The Iran-deal was largly influenced by German negotiators. It was the first step to create a dependency of Iran to the West by lifting some sanctions, getting to population so used to the necessary funds that come from the West that, if they would be in danger to loose it again, they would become angry enough to put the system in danger. it was the first step to create a new system of interconnected dependencies to get Iran back into the international community.

4129,"&gt; Thats clever

Not really, Ukraine has always been pushing for that. 

&gt;Putin lovers from very first moment tried to pretend that Crimea and Donbass are different issues. They aren't.

They are treated as separate issues by the Western powers as well, not just ""Putin lovers"". Hence the Ukrainian complaints. 

&gt;This gives them a false hope that at some point sanctions introduced for launching a war that killed 10k+ people, downing MH-17 and other shit will be lifted and returning Donbass/paying some compensation for MH-17 will be enough.

The bulk of sanctions is tied to the situation in Donbass, and the implementation of the Minsk agreements. 

Sanctions imposed over Crimea target the peninsula itself, and some individuals, but that's far from anything that will ever give Russia pause. 

The idea that sanctions are going to get lifted by implementing the Minsk agreement is not ""false hope"" the Russians are deluding themselves with, it's how the EU puts it, they made the conditions clear. Unless you think they're lying and trying to trick Russia of course. 

&gt;And let's be honest: Ukraine has very limited leverage, EU has no balls, but the key actor here is US. 

The US is not part of the Minsk negotiations, they are held in the Normandy format: Russia, Ukraine, Germany, France. 

There were separate bilateral negotiations between Volker and Surkov on the situation in Donbass, but not on Crimea.

And till 2016 it seemed like they don't care much. But then Trump problem appeared.

&gt;But then Trump problem appeared.

The thing with the US is that the legislative seems to have largely taken over deciding the foreign policy towards Russia, and I don't think there is anything bound to change soon. They'll continue piling on sanctions in the foreseeable future, no matter what happens. Stopping it doesn't look realistic, so Russia is bound to take it as a fact of life and not change much. 

However, there is a limit to what the US can realistically do with sanctions, and they're going to reach it soon. The EU has far more leverage over Russia.

&gt;Fact is that new cold war is on. And it's Pearl Harbor already happened.

Dramatic and inaccurate. If you're going to compare it with events leading up to WW2, Perl fucking Harbor is certainly not it.

They had both parliamentary and presidential elections in 2014 did they not? Was it not the terrorists that disturbed the citizen's right to Vote in the occupied regions in 2014?

While nothing is set in stone, as a guy studying Russian Philology and learning German to go with it, I would love to have a career in a field related to GDR, most likely as an academician. So I think it seems to be a good idea to look for some east German cities, which I believe has the best potential for type of education.

Say, I learned German by myself in Turkey and then studied in Jena for three years. Would my German sound ""totally eastern"" in western part of the country? Would people think like, ""Dude wtf, where the fuck did you learn this kind of German?"" or is it totally fine?

Since you seems to be enamored with national parks lets start there. With the exclusion of Kosovo ( where ever the hell that is) Russia ( because it isn't part of the EU) and France's over sea colonies, US and Europe have roughly the same amount of land allocated to national parks (with the US having about 9000 Km more). So that's not a point in your favor. 

And since we are comparing many small countries and their standard of living to that of one massive country, yes it looks bad. But then you start looking at the other countries that aren't on a list of top countries with the best standards of living and your starry eyed vision of your conglomerate should come down a peg or two.

And since you live in Europe this example should be especially poignant, Nazis Germany. Now let me see, exactly how many people did the Nazis kill because of the laws it put in places. Rough estimates put it at around 6 Million.

4468,"&gt; It will take money from investors in one way or another.

Yes.  But that doesn't mean that it cannot correct incentives while doing so.

* Let's say that Company X has investors at time T.  At time T+1, it engages in fraud, and investors that are now owners or bondholders or whatever at time T+2 suffer.  The fraud benefits the old investors who were involved at time T and damages the new investors.  So a lawsuit against the company as a whole harms all investors at time T+3, but then benefits those defrauded at time T+1.  That acts as a remedy for the harm done.  It transfers money from investors at T to new investors who bought in at time T+1.

* I am not familiar with the details here, but it sounds like the affected may have been bondholders who may not directly care about the price of the company the way a shareholder does.

* I have no idea whether the aim in this particular action is even to mitigate harm or to punish-and-threby-correct-incentives or some of each.  *googles*

    https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/secfines.as
    
    Sounds like both punitive and compensatory mechanisms exist.

    &gt; Monetary penalties levied by the SEC fall into two categories: civil money penalties and disgorgements. Civil penalties are usually fines paid by defendants found liable for damages to the state. In the past, civil money penalties went to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which was apparently negatively affected by the wrongdoing of the party found liable. A civil money penalty is meant to be punitive, and its value will usually be similar to the monetary value of the individual or company's ill-gotten gains.
    &gt;
    &gt; The second type of penalty is called a disgorgement. This penalty is a remedial civil action meant to restore the funds that were received through illegal or unethical business transactions with interest to those affected by the illegal activities.

    -

    &gt; With the passing of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, the courts gave the SEC the ability to distribute disgorgement money (plus interest judged owing on it) and civil money penalties received to the victims of securities law violations through the Fair Funds for Investors provision.

  For putitive matters, I expect that the SEC will not particularly care about any one investor anyway.  Looks like it goes to the victim these days, but they could as easily burn the money, producing a bit of deflation, and achieve their incentive-fixing aim.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b1esq5/us_sues_vw_over_dieselgate_fraud/einmwn4/,vokegaf,1552737853

Then why exactly is the point of bringing up the size of the EU relative to the whole continent if the argument isn't that the rest of Europe is irrelevant? 

&gt;Except it was obvious what he meant, he did clarify it for you and then when confronted about it, you start putting stuff into his other people's mouths, see the beginning of this comment.

It was obvious to you, but not to me. This is a submission where Europe is explicitly used to *not* refer to sole the EU. You might then think it is obvious that a person from the EU would then use Europe in the very same thread to only refer to the EU without any further clarification, but I don't. Why exactly is that so hard for you to grasp?

And what words did I put in his or her mouth? 

&gt;Considering there is a whole list of countries there, all of them are roughly in the same region, it does seem odd to ask for specifics, but OK I guess.

Whole list? As mentioned there are 4 European countries there, out of which 2 are in the EU. 

&gt;This does not sound like I am the one with complexes, I might be invested in pragmatics, but I did not say anything about how important what countries are. But OK.

Yes, but not a long way and there's no need for air/sea transportation, which is much worse anyways.


&gt;Which makes more carbon footprint? an hypothetical big industry or a lot of self producers traveling each one in their own truck?

Local producers are not responsible for delivering their product. At least here, their produce is picked up by the grocery store chain and from there it moves up the supply chain like any other.


Another thing to consider is that the local industry isn't necessarily any smaller than the big foreign industry. To me this isn't really a debate between big and small produces, but between local and foreign.


I also have another reason to favor local which I did not bring up previously because it has little to do with the environment. Human rights.

Being gay is a thing. It’s a pretty well evidenced sexual identity, and I’ve no issues with gay people. My issue is with fetishising and Balkanising gender and sexualities, with the accompanying expectation that it be taken seriously. The explosion in special snowflake identities is indisputable. Feel you have both masculine and feminine traits? Well, some would call that normal but let’s instead call it bigender! Don’t feel sexual attraction to somebody without a strong emotional connection? Seems normal for a lot of people, but let’s create the exciting new demisexual identity! Heterosexual guy feeling a bit left out? We got you covered, bro! You can fly the gynephilia flag.

The Czechoslovak government continuously existed in exile when the wartime Slovak republic was established, during its existence (remember Košický vládny program?) and after it and participated in the liberation from the fascist regime. 

&amp;#x200B;

This means that there is little to no legal argument for Tiso being the president of any Slovak citizen that didn't live through the war, and the argument that can be made is of emotional nature, based on individual self-determination as belonging to something.

4615,"&gt; Why on earth would you pay more for a man?     
        
That's the point. Hiring a woman **is not cheaper** than hiring a man *for the same job*. If you are the HR manager of a firm and you have a male and female applicant for a job, and they have the same degree and years of experience, you are not even allowed by law to just offer a lower wage depending on sex.     
    
Let's repeat myself for the 1000th time in these discussions, because it just doesn't seem to sink in: **The statistic is about why, on the aggregate, there are more men on higher paying levels than women.** Bringing up that there are a lot of men with hard and physically heavy jobs does not change that statistic one bit.      
    
It is up to you to explain why there are so much less women on company board or senior executive management levels. The difference in physical strength can't explain it, and since [there is so much variation between countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_on_corporate_boards_of_directors#Current_landscape) clearly hardwired brain differences can't explain it either, unless we say that Portuguese women (7.9% women on boards) have much smaller brains than Norwegian women (35%).            
       
You write:    
    
&gt; Yes, woman are capable of any job a man can do. That doesnt mean they apply for it.    
    
I wrote:     
    
&gt; When this is pointed out, the argument usually shifts to whether women ""choose"" to do these on average lower-paying jobs.

4633,"&gt; Also mein Bauer füttert seine Rinder ausschließlich mit Gras von seiner eigenen Weide, auch im Winter. Soja tut den Tieren und der Welt nicht gut.
Da ist er dann aber eher in der Ausnahme, zumal wenn das alle täten es wahrscheinlich nicht mehr von der Fläche passen würde. Das müsste dann unbedingt mit einem geringeren Fleischkonsum einhergehen was unter klimatechnischen Aspekten ja durchaus sinnvoll ist. Lässt man das ethische beiseite, dann ist es der Erde egal wenn die Hälfte gar kein Fleisch mehr isst oder alle nur noch halb so viel. 

&gt;Wo hat denn bitte Obst/Gemüse Nährstoffe die sich im Fleisch finden? Vitamin A in Form von Retinol, Vitamin E, Vitamin K2 und die essentiellen Aminosäuren sind nicht genügen in Pflanzen zu finden, vor allem wenn man die Bioverfügbarkeit (z.B. wird von uns nur etwa 1/50 vom pflanzlichen Vitamin A: Beta-Carotin in unsere Form: Retinol umgwandelt)
Vitamin K ist in grünem Blattgemüse viel drin und auch in Kreuzblütlern gut drin.
Vitamin A ist in Karotten, Grünkohl und auch Spinat drin. Ob ich das jetzt als Retinol über Fleisch zu mir nehme (wo die Dosis höher ist) oder über Pflanzen ist für die Bioverfügbarkeit soweit ich weiß egal. 
Vitamin E kommt in sehr vielen Pflanzenölen vor. 
Was das Eiweiß angeht (Aminosäuren) ist mittlerweile vielfach belegt (schon seit den 80ern soweit ich weiß), dass auch ohne Fleisch (oder sogar ganz vegan) kein Eiweißproblem auftritt. Hülsenfrüchte, Getreide, Nüsse und Samen haben davon mehr als ausreichend, selbst für Menschen mit hohem Bedarf (Sportler etwa). 

&gt;Zum Wasser“verbrauch“: das Wasser verschwindet nicht einfach, es kommt zurück in den Boden. Es ist bewiesen dass Weiderinder Desertifikation vorbeugen und entlaugten Boden (Böden die nach mehreren Jahren von Monokulturen wie Soja/Mais/Reis extrem beschädigt sind) wieder aufbereiten.
Naja, es findet natürlich ein Wasserkreislauf statt. Der wird aber überlastet, wenn man zu viel Grundwasser entnimmt ohne dass es schnell genug nachfließen kann. Deswegen ist viel Wasser verbrauchen ja überhaupt schlecht. 
Und selbst wenn Weideflächen Desertifikation vorbeugen, dann ist das  in Deutschland im Vergleich zu anderen Ländern wahrscheinlich ein weniger entscheidender Faktor. Außerdem: Wenn da vorher ein Wald stand, dann eine Monokultur kommt (die statistisch für Tierfütterung vorgesehen ist, so wie 2/3 der globalen Weideflächen) und dann eine Weide das Gebiet ""rettet"": Warum nicht den Wald stehen lassen?

&gt;Zum Methan - du glaubst nicht wirklich das Flugzeuge oder Frachtschiffe mit zur Hälfte vergammeltem Obst das quer über die Welt fliegt/fährt weniger schlimm als eine furzende Kuh?
[Ja, leider doch](https://www.bmu.de/themen/wirtschaft-produkte-ressourcen-tourismus/produkte-und-konsum/produktbereiche/konsum-und-ernaehrung/) Ein Kilo frisches Gemüse verbaucht ca. 100mal weniger CO2 als ein Kilo Rindfleisch. Da ist ein Interkontinentalflug für das Gemüse bestimmt nicht hilfreich, aber kommt immer noch nicht an das Rind ran. 

&gt;Fleisch ist extrem effizient.
Mal rein logisch gedacht. Ich hab ne 700 Kilo Kuh und einen 70 Kilo Menschen. Die Kuh braucht offensichtlich mehr Nahrung als der Mensch. Warum der Kuh als Fläche geben für Nahrung auf der man für einen Menschen mehr anbauen könnte? Eine Kuh braucht 4000 bis 20.000 Quadratmeter an Fläche. Da kann man Gemüse für ne Familie fürs ganze Jahr anbauen.

Hoffe ich konnte irgendwie auf alles eingehen ohne zu sehr zu wirken als ob ich in meinem Glauben verbohrt bin. Klar ausgewogen und lokal orientiert ist auch gut. Was ich nur festhalten will ist: a) Es ginge besser b) Wenn man allerdings schon mal da hin kommt, dass man nur lokal und ausgewogen (Ein mal die Woche Fleisch zB) isst, ist schon viel geschafft.

4646,"&gt; Those parties all choose in which parliamentary groups they associate. If ChristenUnie doesn't mind mingling with semi-authoritarians as long as they are christian, then perhaps you should revise your opinion on ChristenUnie. Be sure to let them know that you are appalled that they choose to associate themselves with those folks. 

That's not how politics work... This is like saying the coalition partners should drop the government if they don't like compromises. Those political groups exist because they *need* to group up if they want to make an impact there. They group up on very vague common interests and try to defend those interests best they can in the EP. Separated they are irrelevant. All christian conservative parties in Europe, no exceptions, are part of that group. Including for example the British Conservative party. If you want political influence you are forced to work together, including with people you might not want to work together with. And the EP has a particular problem where it has political groups that act like all christian democrats or liberals or whatever from each European country are the same ""because they are all of X political leaning"". Well, no. D66 and VVD are together in the liberal group, even though they are drastically different parties... and those are from the same country and political climate. The foreign parties in there are going to be even more different. It's a horrible system that tries to push together very different parties into one group.   


&gt; That seems like circular reasoning: ""The people don't feel connected because there's a low turnout, and they don't turn out because they don't feel connected"". Decisions are made in the EP, feeling or not. Better go vote. 

It isn't a circular reasoning, you conjured up the second half by yourself... I never claimed that the low turn-out is because of disconnection; I don't and can't know why exactly the turn-out is so low. What I can say is that a ridiculously low turn-out like that is a strong indication that people do not care about European politics and don't feel connected to it enough to bother voting.  


&gt; Then why don't you trust them to elect good representatives in the parliament? 

Because it's not the election itself I have issues with, but the *functioning* of the EP. I have no qualms with the Council, even if they can be slow on some issues. Plus, the high turn-out for national elections give them a better democratic mandate.  


&gt; Governments always are less representative than an entire parliament. They don't represent the opposition, they only send one person of one government party, and if you're concerned about turnout: national elections don't have 100% turnout either. 

And certainly not 35% either.... Representation is not a purely technical thing. Sure, the government is indirectly chosen, the EP directly. In theory that gives the EP a better democratic mandate, but in reality people can not feel represented by an institution even if the systematic representation is perfectly fine. And that seems to be the case for the EP. I even wonder whether the average voter knows that it exists, it gets almost zero media coverage here and it is pretty much never spoken about. You can't have representation under those circumstances. And yes, that is also an issue with our national media, not just the EP itself.

- God's will when something bad happens. Connection between corruption/incompetence, fire prevention rules (and their application) and [Colective nightclub fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectiv_nightclub_fire)? Some people will never see the connection, will not acknowledge that we have to do some changes and we have some work to do to not see something like that again. Its easier to blame God.

- God is testing you. Similar with the above but is more about bringing the guilty parties in front of justice. Instead they are seen as innocent agents of God, who decided that bad thing for you as a test.

- God's will when you did something bad. Is not your fault. God made you do it. Why should you even bother trying to change/learn something from it when is not even your fault? And what do you mean I have to pay for my mistakes? Don't you hear it wasn't me? And how dare you insinuate that God did something wrong. Your stupid limited mind doesn't understand but God did it for a reason, a good reason a beyond your comprehension.

- Lack of ambitions. What you have is what God decided is for you. You don't need more. Be happy that you have what you have, others (also as a result of God deciding for them) don't even have what you have.

- God will reward you/punish them in the afterlife. Yeah this life suck, yeah those shitheads steal from you, from state, but you don't need to bother to do anything to change things. Leave it as it is. God sees and in the afterlife...

4845,"That's a very different matter.

Legislatures can pass laws which have legal force and are expected to be enacted.

They can also pass non-binding resolutions.  Those don't do anything in the real world.

It is regrettably easy for the public to confuse the two, because they sound similar, but they are distinct classes of thing, they exist side-by-side, and the decision to use one or the other is meaningful.

The only reason the Brexit referendum comes up and is called ""nonbinding"" is because the UK has an quite unusual constitutional structure for historical reasons.

Once, there were absolute monarchs.  Their power was unlimited, and they could legally do whatever they wanted.  They were [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty).  All lesser authorities — judges, stuff like that — existed because they granted them limited authority.

In present-day systems, it's typical to have a constitutional system.  There, the *constitution* is sovereign, holds the unlimited power, and from that source of authority flows all else — it ""delegates"" its own power to other, lesser, authorities, and has some way to permit itself to be modified.

So in the US, for example, the US Constitution can ""do anything"".  It delegates limited grants of power to federal and state authorities.  And atop those limited grants of power is built all other law and authority.

This is not how the UK works.

The UK once had an absolute monarch.  Over time, it iteratively transformed into a system where more-or-less absolute power is effectively vested in a majority of Parliament.  50%+1 of Parliament is sovereign, though there are still a lot of trappings from the earlier system, where various authorities pretend to exist only at the sufferance of the *monarch*.

In the UK, there is not a ""constitution"" in the conventional sense.  Rather, there is a collection of traditions that one simply *does not violate* by convention, most of which are not codified.  Those are, in British legal parlance, described as a ""constitution"".  I would personally say that the UK does not have a constitution at all, which would probably annoy British legal scholars, but that's really besides the point.  The British system is unusual, but obviously one that Britons have demonstrated can work.

(Personal comment: as best I can tell, there have been British efforts to have a *de facto* constitution, to do yet another iterative transformation, and these have been built atop EU membership.  That is, Parliament is still sovereign in the eyes of the UK, but *effectively* it is not as long as it is unwilling to leave the EU.  Thus, laws passed at an EU level *effectively* acted as a constitution, albeit at the EU level, and it would have been possible to build structures akin to those of a constitution at a national level, atop EU law.  Had the UK remained in the EU, when the EU federalized, and British sovereignty ended, the UK would have in my eyes effectively become not merely a *de facto* constitutional republic, but *de jure*.  Brexit effectively razes these efforts, which I imagine — and I have seen other articles speculating on — will result in new constitutional efforts in the UK post-Brexit.)

Anyway, I'm getting off-track.  The relevant bit here is that a sovereign may not be bound, because its power is absolute.  [A majority of Parliament is sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty).  So there is *no way* to force Parliament to do anything ([""Can God make a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it?""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox)  In Parliament's case, no.)  It is impossible for the *people* to bind Parliament via referendum, because Parliament is an absolute, unrestricted power.  So, yes, technically, no referendum in the UK can be binding, because of Parliamentary sovereignty, and that is *why* the Brexit referendum can be said to be non-binding.

But…that ""non-binding"" nature has to be understood in the context of Parliamentary sovereignty and the British tradition of dealing with issues created by a sovereign Parliament by simply saying that there are things which one *does not do*, even if one theoretically has the authority to do them.  The British system only functions, only permits Parliamentary sovereignty to not create massive problems, because there are certain things that one *does not do*.

And going back on an explicit promise to implement the results of the referendum would very probably be among those things.  The referendum is the functional equivalent of a binding referendum in the British system, even if Parliament cannot be bound.  The public expectation is that Parliament treat it as if Parliament was bound to do so even if the public has no legal way to do that.

If Parliament had wanted the equivalent of a non-binding referendum in countries that do have a constitution, I assume that it would have said something like ""we are holding an advisory vote, which Parliament will take into account in deciding how to act"".  It did, in fact, do that with the various sub-national governments, like the Scottish government — it extended no veto over Brexit, but it said that it would take into consideration issues raised by that government.

So raising the non-binding nature of the referendum is rather misleading, because in functional terms, its role was really what a binding referendum would have in a constitutional system.  I think that the people doing so are just unhappy about the result of the referendum (which I can understand; I would also be unhappy) and casting about for any grounds to object to implementation, whereas I do not believe that the same people would have accepted the same argument had the outcome been different.

This form of being bound is sometimes described as ""politically binding"" rather than ""legally binding"".  That is, it may be considered politically-unacceptable not to be bound, even if no court would object.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b1iy6u/no_more_business_as_usual_russia_not_a_strategic/ein5uin/,vokegaf,1552711860

Not a plausible forgetfulness, but a highly selective, implausible type. Their evidence was evasive, frustrating and self-damning.
The Saville inquiry had promised immunity from further legal action to all witnesses who told the truth about their actions on the day. In that quiet inquiry room, one and a half decades ago, the soldiers of 1 Para might have come clean and admitted what they had done before sinking back into anonymity and retirement. Instead they stuck to their lies.
For example, on the day itself, four soldiers — E, F, G and H — moved as a brick into one of the more concealed areas of the Bogside. By their own evidence they were responsible for at least half of the deaths that day. By the time of the Saville inquiry, soldiers E and G were dead, but F and H were not, were called and clearly reluctantly appeared. H was the soldier who had fired the most number of shots that day, including 19 he said he fired at a single window that did not shatter. But it was soldier F — who fired 13 rounds on the day — whose performance in 1972 and 2003 was most disturbing. It always seemed to me that if anyone was deserving of prosecution, then it was him.

F started lying from the moment the shooting stopped. Like every other soldier who had fired, F was immediately asked to give the Royal Military Police (RMP) his justification for, and direction of, each shot. So in the early hours of 31 January 1972 F pointed on a map to a number of positions where he claimed to have fired at gunmen and nail-bombers. At no stage did he admit to firing at the rubble barricade where Michael Kelly had fallen, shot side-on in the abdomen. Yet while F was speaking to the RMP, at the nearby hospital a 7.62mm calibre bullet was being dug out of the spine of Michael Kelly’s body.
In the weeks that followed the rifles of the soldiers who had fired were sent to a Belfast laboratory for testing. Realising that unmentioned shots would be traced to his gun, F chose to radically alter his story.
So at Lord Widgery’s inquiry, several weeks after the day, F decided to recall firing at a ‘bomber’ at the rubble barricade. There was no bomber at the barricade. But the bullet that had lodged in Kelly’s body was indeed shown to have come from F’s rifle. And so at that earliest stage of the search for the truth, F’s first lie — and first murder — was exposed. And nothing happened. F stayed in the army and periodically received promotion.
Under questioning in 2003, the short and stocky F — then in late middle age — was reduced to monosyllabic answers, generally of either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. He claimed to remember almost nothing of the day, despite it being his first visit to Londonderry and — by his own admission — the most shots he had fired on any deployment up to that date. Under devastating questioning, F was shown to have killed at least four people that day. One of them was Patrick Doherty, shot through a buttock as he was crawling away. One more killing which soldier F had ‘forgotten’ about when first questioned by the RMP.
Then, while Doherty lay crying in agony, a 41-year-old man called Barney McGuigan stepped out from behind a block of flats to try to get help for the dying man. McGuigan was waving a white handkerchief. According to the testimony of numerous witnesses, including an officer from another regiment stationed on the city walls, soldier F — positioned on the other side of the road — got down on one knee and shot McGuigan through the head. No one who saw the mortuary photos of the exit wound in McGuigan’s face will forget what just that one bullet of soldier F’s did.
Unusually, F’s first name is in the public domain. It is ‘Dave’. It is public because a number of witnesses heard it shouted. One wounded civilian lying on the ground heard the brick of four soldiers calling to each other. ‘I’ve got another one’ shouted one. And then, ‘We’re pulling out, Dave.’
In 1972 Dave — F — committed perjury in front of Lord Chief Justice Widgery. He perjured himself again before Lord Saville in 2003. Perhaps on that disastrous day in 1972 he thought he was teaching the citizens of Londonderry some kind of lesson. Or perhaps — under what he presumed to be suitable cover — he just seized an opportunity to kill with impunity on British streets. It is true that few people are comfortable with retired soldiers being prosecuted. But if soldier F did indeed presume he could get away with murder that day, who is comfortable with that presumption proving right?""

Fuck that murdering cunt and fuck anyone who stands in the way of him finally receiving justice. The prick has been walking around for nearly 50 years because the British Army and Government covered up his crimes.

4979,"&gt;national identity is now based on the idea of being ""Hitler's first victim.""

Which, to the extent its still a view held currently (and especially in the past), not incidentally ignores Austria already having been a [authoritarian fascist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrofascism) since '34 at that point and that the Anschluss itself [was enthusiastically embraced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss#German_troops_march_into_Austria) by at least a substantial subset of the Austrian population. And the narrative is of course also key to Austria never having undergone denazification after the war and has only much slower confronted its own past in that regard, perhaps exemplified through [Kurt Waldheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Waldheim), the Austrian ambassador to the UN '72-'81 and President (head of state but not government) '86-'92 who's position in those jobs was an ongoing, two decades long, international scandal due to his military career (highest lieutnant rank) in the Wehrmacht and possible involvement in war crimes in Yugoslavia.

All this doesn't mean Austria was not indeed a victim - and the Austrofascist and Nazis were indeed openly hostile to each other and the former opposed the Anschluß - but it actively skips over those darker parts of Austrian history in favor of a straightforward victim narrative.

5021,"&gt;Article 13(5) blocks ContentID as it says any mechanism which would result in legitimate works being taken offline is not allowed.

and article 13(4) says a website is liable if any content is repeatedly uploaded onto the same site. 

You can't comply with both, thats for sure. 

&gt;A convenient result of this is that those companies have ample resources to cope with the requirements. 

while that is true for FB, YT I'm not sure it helps smaller platforms like soundcloud, vimeo or live-leak, rather the opposite. 
 
&gt;Sure, a provider can be liable if they cannot prove they have made a best effort to take offline copies of works that they were told should be removed.

So sticking with our previous example of a Seinfeld episode, I very much doubt that an episode with 20 minutes of silence added at the end could ever be considered ""best efforts"". Therefore hosting sites would have to apply something like contentID, most likely stricter. 

&gt;That's not true. Again, Article 13(4) only requires a best effort to be made. YouTube can legally allow false negatives to go through their system, as long as they can prove they tried.

See again this is where the nature of a Directive for something like internet services is dangerous. 

All 27 (or whatever) members can make different interpretations of what ""best efforts"" are. Most sites will just go for the strictest and apply that to the whole EU, because one strict set of rules is still easier than 27 different set of rules. 

&gt;So either YouTube keeps using ContentID, and they will comply with Article 13(4) but not Article 13(5). Either they will tune down their algorithms are start focussing on actual copies and not adaptations, and even though there might be more misses, they will comply with both Article 13(4) and Article 13(5).

See that's the thing, I doubt any website will tune filters down. There is zero reason to. 

For a site this is a cost benefit analysis. ¨Lets go through it, from a content sites perspectie

In other words, his work is important not as a historical document, but rather, as a literary critique or analysis of what it takes to drive a society into totalitarianism.  

The American author, Tim O'Brien, makes much the same point in ""The Things They Carried,"" when he argues that the absolute truth of stories about the Vietnam war is less important than the larger meaning that, when correctly told, they are able to impart.

Europe is also the home of the BMW 3 series which is widely considered to be the benchmark for 4-door sedans.  The Tesla model 3 is a sedan, comparing it to hatchbacks doesn't make sense regardless of where you live.  Also, the e-Golf is probably the most ridiculous electric vehicle you can currently buy.

It's because Germany was forced to do things like develop the V-2 because they lost control of the air.  While they were taking little pot-shots at London with their V-2s the allies were obliterating one German city after another.

The reason allied countries didn't spend as much time developing things like rockets and jet aircraft was because they didn't need to.  And the things that the allies did invest their money into, like strategic bombers, were far more advanced than anything the German's had created.

Now if the situation was reversed would the allies have been able to develop vengeance weapons like the V-2 while the Germans perfected all the technology that made the B-29 Superfortress such an amazing bomber like pressurized cabins, computer controlled fire-control systems?

If she were to take a year off instead, not only would we lose money but her career would take a hit and she'd lose a lot of the reputation she's built.

Please explain to me how it's better to support my career instead of her, considering I don't even have one and that would literally lose us money even in short term?

&gt;I have several friends whose husbands couldn't stay home because their bosses didn't like the idea. Two weeks, ok, not longer. 

They must've not been working in Finland, considering the bosses can't decide that for them. Either that, or they had other reasons not related to their bosses saying no to not stay at home.

&gt;We are shoving all families into a mold right now. 

Which is why I'd like us to stop doing that.

&gt;It's easy to tell what the average family does because they are doing it, because it's how the job markets work. 

Could you please explain to me why you would want every family to do what the government tells them to do instead of deciding for themselves?

5235,"Your math is cute and all, what it ignores is the reality. This is an unstable salt-mine, these barrels are rusty and radiating, as such the effort for all that shit is immense.

For a more updated take on that situation you can [read here](https://www.dw.com/en/nuclear-waste-in-disused-german-mine-leaves-a-bitter-legacy/a-47420382):

&gt; Listening to the engineer talk, one begins to grasp just how complicated the retrieval could get — and how expensive: ""We would have to build a retrieval mine, which is more than simply just a new shaft. We would also need an interim storage facility for the waste, and we would have to create many new shafts to gain access to the individual chambers.""

&gt; Lautsch adds that the construction phase for this will easily take eight or nine years. ""By about 2024, we have to start construction"". The old shafts and the horizontal paths in the mountain do not meet the current legal standards on nuclear material.

&gt; This means that a completely new mine will have to be built around the old mine, simply to retrieve the barrels. **If everything went according to plan, the retrieval could begin in 2033.**

If you are now aware that Germany has been in the process of planing&amp;building an airport for nearly 3 decades, which has by now become [the second most expensive building on this planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_buildings) and still isn't finished, then you'd also be very skeptical about that whole situation.

&gt; I'm pretty sure you could fit all of this easily several times over onto the premises of a coal plant. Germany has 80+ such coal plants.

Very funny, but sadly completely ignorant of the reality that Germany is a very densely populated country. In the US it's way easier to find some vast piece of land that's [already radiated wasteland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Test_Site) with barely anybody living there, but **no such places exist in Germany** and we rather want to keep it that way because we've got no land to spare.

But in first past the post systems as in the UK, very rarely does a representative represent more than a minority. And even should a representative get more than half the votes, it is usually because splitting votes will always lead to no representation at all.

*googles*

Sounds like you're right that we had an impact, but that the beginning of the shift towards stars predated us and happened in Europe.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(heraldry)#Classical_heraldry

&gt; Stars are comparatively rare in European heraldry during the medieval period. An early reference of dubious historicity is reported by Johannes Letzner, who cites Conradus Fontanus (an otherwise unknown authority) to the effect that one Curtis von Meinbrechthausen, a knight of Saxony, in 1169 after committing a murder lost his rank and arms, described as an eight-pointed star beneath a chevron. Examples of stars in a late medieval heraldry of the Holy Roman Empire include those of Wentz von Niederlanstein (1350), Gemm (attested 1352), Geyer von Osterberg (1370), Enolff Ritter von Leyen (d. 1392).[5]
&gt;
&gt;Under the system of cadency in use in England and Ireland since the late 15th century, a third son bears a mullet (unpierced) as a difference.[6]
&gt;
&gt;Stars become much more popular as heraldic charges in the early modern era, especially in then-recent family coats of arms of burghers and patricians, as well as in coats of arms of cities (e.g. Maastricht, Bozen, Kaufbeuren).[7] The coat of arms of Valais originates in the 16th century, when seven stars representing its Seven Tithings were added to the party per pale coat of arms of the Bishop of Sion. Of the higher nobility in Siebmachers Wappenbuch (1605), the landgrave of Hessen and the counts of Waldeck and Erbach have stars in their coats of arms, as do several Swiss knights.
&gt;
&gt; United States
&gt;
&gt; Stars are nearly ubiquitous in United States heraldry and vexillology and nearly always appear unpierced with five straight-sided points. In the flag of the United States, each star represents one state.[9] The flag adopted in 1777 is the attributed origin of the thirteen stars, representing the thirteen United States, appearing on the Great Seal since 1780.[10]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b1e5l4/chinese_foreign_minister_to_visit_brussels_after/eilrfzk/,vokegaf,1552672525

The Gilets Jaunes ""movement"" is born on facebook, from groups of people who are intoxicated by fake news, and are politically illiterate (they literally asked for things that already existed, they do not participate to local politics, they do not declare their protests like everyone does except far right extremists or anarchists who find the government illegitimate).

Since the beginning it was plagued by populism, conspiracy theories and borderline nationalism. Even now that some of them try to reach common agreements with the climate protests, it's fully devolving into anti-capitalism, veganism and other popular social media stuff (which do not match the scientists' suggestion as written in the IPCC report).

The very thing that made those people go in the streets in their opposition to a carbon tax on diesel. 

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't mean everything is bad about the existence of that movement: it brings the topic of police violence on the scene, it shows that even people brainwashed by fake news want to be involved in political activities (even if they still have to learn the basics). It was also an opportunity for Macron to make big progress in the social field - which he sadly didn't. The ""grand débat"" isn't a bad thing per se and it could help channeling some of the energy from the Gilets Jaunes and other into something more constructive, but it also gives a lot of visibility to anti-vaxx and racist groups.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, the bad outweighs the good by far, but it's not Macron's fault, and it's not up to him to do some good by listening to the Gilets Jaunes. It's up to the Gilets Jaunes to have a political awakening, stop believing fake news, stop voting for fascists (or not not voting at all), stop blaming teachers and so on.",,/r/europe/comments/b1fm6c/there_really_is_a_french_exception/eilrjg7/,Alien_BHL,1552672584

Only sky is the limit. And people will to sacrifice comfort. Science to keep comfort at same level is far away.

&gt; A big historic one would be the Monday protests in the GDR (there were other factors as well but they all played together)

The main difference is that there was already people's will and they needed the government to sign off. No need for tech breakthrough.

Yet we have no will of the people (even for those participating in protests it's iffy to implement drastic changes). Tech breakthrough is necessary. Or we'll have a massive reduce in comfort.

There were a lot of global events that lead to the fall of eastern bloc. If it was a different decade, it would have ended like Prague or Budapest events. Yet right now consumption is rising and there's little will to stop it. There're some fringe movements, but will take years to develop them. Just take a look at e.g. minimalism. Core idea is kinda nice, but popular culture made it into design/fashion wave to just sell more expensive stuff with pretence of being minimalist. Sort of like people buying new car for the sake of ecology, while driving their old one would be even more ecological.

&gt; The spontaneous protests against the problematic articles of the new EU copyright laws also changed already some politicians' votes (we'll see if it changes enough)

Unfortunately, I don't think that's a good example. Rather an example how various lobbies are active in EU parliament. And how little protests can change. :(

No. I'm implying that people should

Nuclear also has a pretty unique problem. Most forms of waste from energy aren't inherently dangerous - I mean, you have CO2 and Methane, but those things aren't *radioactive*. Nuclear waste isn't something we'll have to worry about for the next century or so, seeing as there is so little of it, but it will be something for our grandkids to worry about.

My view is that nuclear should be expanded until it pushes coal, natural gas, and other far dirtier forms of energy into the minority, but we should focus most of our money and time into developing nuclear fusion. If we can create that technology and move away from fission, we'll really take human civilization to the next level.

5572,"&gt; This is how fingerprinting works.

That's indeed how fingerprinting works because that's exactly what fingerprinting tries to do. It tries to detect all sorts of edits and adaptations of works. This is not required. The law only requires _specific_ future uploads. 

&gt; Currently liability is handled on a notice and takedown system. A site can only be guilty once they have been notified. A13 flips that on it's head. You said yourself content ID flags, parody or covers. What do you think happens then, when sites have to tune the sensitivity up because they don't want to get sued? You will get even more blocked content on bogus ©.

You are making claims that aren't just not in the law, but actively contradict the law.

1. Content-ID like systems are not required. Platforms are only required to take offline future uploads of _specific_ works. Derivative works are protected by different copyright.
2.  Platforms only have to put in a best-effort to prevent future uploads of those specific copies of works. It doesn't say they have to prevent all or even most future uploads. This is especially relevant, because Article 13(5) bans platforms from using systems like ContentID which would flag a lot of false positives. If you are challenged in court for a false positive, there is little legal defence for you. You are liable. If you are challenged in court for a false negative, you can easily claim the effort you put in was the best effort you could, since any further effort would result in false positives, and thus be in violation of Article 13(5). 

&gt; so is the sentence

You only copied half of the sentence. The law has the same structure as Directive 2000/31/EC, which it basically amends. 

Currently, platforms are liable for publishing copyrighted works unless they:

1. Can prove they were authorised to publish the material.
2. Acted expeditiously to take it offline as soon as they were aware of the violation.

The new directive changes that for a very specific subset of platforms. They will be liable unless they:

1. Can prove they were authorised for publishing the material, and can prove they made a best effort to obtain authorisation.
2. Acted expeditiously to take it offline as soon as they received a well-substantiated and transparent takedown notice.
3. Made a best effort to prevent future uploads of that same specific violating material they took offline in (2). Additionally, right holders should be able to give copies of works pre-emptively.

So no, platforms aren't just liable for any copyrighted material. I cannot pardon you as you request, since you seemingly deliberately left out most of the sentence you are citing. That is disingenuous. Furthermore, an equivalent to the fragment you cited is already part of the E-Commerce directive Article 13 would replace for some websites, so you are literally complaining about something that is already law.

First off: how is this a political thing? You should inform yourself about something so important and not rely on some politicians spoonfeeding you every bit and piece!
Our global climate changes insofar as that the average global temperature rises. Which despabilises local climates, which causes a giant chain reaction of increased severity of weather phenomenons (because higher temperatures = more energy in our weather system), plants and animals dying left and right because evolution can only really kick in in timespans in the range of hundred thousands of years of years not in a couple of decades, entire regions becoming uninhabitable (middle east/north africa getting litterally to hot to live, land getting submerget by rising sea levels (this is REALLY bad, because most of humanity lives at or near the coast)) and a million bigger or smaller effects resulting from this, that we cannot predict. 

Tl,dr: climate change = global warming = BAD

When people actively go on the street, they also make it more part of their identity that they are aware of environmental impact and that it is part of their identity to do SOMETHING about it, making it more likely that they will consume more environmentally friendly, etc. This is much better than doing nothing and not protesting.

It's so easy to complain about these things, when you're not doing anything about it yourself. 

Conventional farming has problems that organic farming tries to solve and maybe it causes more problems than it solves. We cannot really live sustainably with either of them, but we have to find a better solution. Probably lowering consumption or consuming more of the less impactful crops is the most realistic solution.

Either way, the method for lowering environmental impact is not what is up here, it is people showing a willingness and a pressure to do something. With will we can find the best methods. But first we must prioritize it, which we really don't do yet. About 0.7% of all new car sales in Denmark in 2018 were electric, 0.7%!, regardless of how little or much there is to gain environmentally from switching to electric, people are not even trying.",,/r/europe/comments/b1ccr5/student_climate_protest_in_cologne_germany/eikxw3x/,chickensoupglass,1552650827

So they'll pay on equal pay day less because they earn less than men. I don't see a problem with that.

It's no secret that our govt decided to promote right-wing media (which is low but previous one was promoting left-wing). My guess is that he doesn't really read all the stuff he approves for local shop to be sold- he either has someone to verify the list or simply reads it and decides what can be sold.

A better, not politically divisive way of arguing about it, is that practically, the logistics involved in supporting a force across an ocean is expensive even for the Americans, and the political will to fight even a defensive war has always been wavering at best when not directly effecting American citizens, such as what Pearl Harbour achieved.

A careful analysis of the Korean War, Vietnam War, and both Gulf Wars would should that Americans are simply incapable of acting out effective proxy wars, against even weak opponents, and none of them ended in anything that can be safely called a ""victory"".

We cannot relly in Americans, not simply because politically we simply don't have any say in their domestic or foreign policy and are vulnerable to their whims, but also because short of an outright attack on American soil, the US over-the-ocean combat preparedness is simply not worth anything.
