11,"Sure. It's simple really, the prime minister and leader of the biggest political party Babiš is a typical ""new populist"" politician - he's neither right nor left, with almost all of his policies stemming from what ""the people"" want. He has a great marketing department that's not only doing PR but mainly finds out how the mood in the population regarding different policies changes, and then he himself changes his opinions according to those moods.  
  
This is of course retarded, but unfortunately works pretty well as long as nothing serious is happening. In the time of crisis, such leader is completely incapable of taking responsibility to make unpopular but neccessary decisions. Even if he appoints competent people as ministers (which he doesn't), he controls them and doesn't let them do their work. Our minister of health was pretty bad, but he wanted to resume mandatory mask wearing in certain situations in the middle of August, which was smart. The prime minister publicly stopped him the next day when he found out his voters don't like it. The minister later stepped down, tired of this shit. Oh, and the president is also an asshole, which doesn't help. The opposition in the parliament is competent, but not strong enough.  
  
What's surprising is that despite having a great marketing team, the prime minister is absolutely incapable of communicating the simple things about covid to the masses. He's an oligarch that owns several major media and yet he collossally fucked up communicating anything regarding covid - no clear plan what to do, no clear instructions stating how important masks and distancing are, instead chaotic information that changes every day and people are fed up. At the same time tracing has not worked for the last month and a half because the system is completely overwhelmed, so of course there's community transfer.  
  
Even sadder is that we do have a ton of smart scientists who predicted everything that was and is happening. It's not like clear information wasn't there, it was just ignored. I can only hope that this situation breaks the fuckards neck politically - I really disliked him when he was only stealing and lying on a major scale, but now I'm fucking pissed.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/j78jvg/covid19_cases_per_100000_inhabitants_in_the_last/g87bzjv/,Vozka,1602239506

26,"Islamism? A lot of are secular arab nationalists are also anti-Semitic, and islamism is a right wing ideology.  


There are also many anti zionists, and while in this context anti zionism isn't really antisemetism (because of the nature of the israeli arab conflict), it probably is correlated with/related to antisemetism.  


The truth is, islamism isn't as much of a thing as some people think it is. Have you ever heard of the baath movement (there are 2 tendencies, a fascist one and a more socialist leaning one), or wahhabism, or monarchism, or khomenism, etc?  


It is not as simple as islamists are coming to europe, its much more complex than that.   


Also, just to be clear here, I am not saying refugees/immigrants from the middle east are not contributing to this spike in antisemetism, I am just pointing out that islamism isn't really a thing.  


Also, nazism? Antisemetism in europe/germany predates nazism, and I would say that a lot of right wing (maybe antisemetic) german movements aren't so much nazi as they are broadly nationalist/conservative (even if they are extreme).  


I mean look at the AFD, would you really call it Nazi (I would say, maybe fascist, but not really nazi).  
While nazism is a form of fascism/far right ideology, it isn't the only one, it has a meaning (national socialism, which is also not socialism). Fascism is not just nazism.

159,"&gt;Brussels is looking at how to compensate European fishermen that lose out from Brexit by handing them part of Britain’s old fishing rights in EU waters, as it seeks to unblock one of the toughest remaining issues in the EU-UK future relationship talks.

&gt;Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, urged EU governments this week to moderate their demands for retaining existing fishing quotas in British waters, warning them that they had to be realistic on what could be secured. 

&gt;But diplomats said that Brussels had emphasised that the blow could be softened for France, Denmark, Belgium and other fishing nations by intelligently reallocating old British quotas in the EU’s post-Brexit exclusive fishing zone.  

&gt;The matter will also be sensitive for Britain because of the risk that, depending on the EU’s priorities, particular British coastal communities could be hit.  

&gt;The plans, which diplomats said were being discussed among EU member states, would be a way of partially offsetting reduced opportunities to operate in British waters, showing that sacrifices are being made by the sectors on both sides of the English Channel.   

&gt;Fishing rights are one of the biggest sticking points in the UK and EU’s future relationship talks. The EU went into the future relationship negotiations seeking to “uphold” access to British waters as well as existing catching rights for more than 70 types of fish that straddle the EU-UK maritime border. Britain, on the other hand, wants to ditch the old model for dividing up quotas and make access to its waters conditional on successful annual negotiations.  

&gt;Although the EU fishing sector employs fewer than 180,000 people and accounts for less than 1 per cent of the bloc’s economic output, capitals warn that their coastal communities risk devastation from Brexit, with very real political ramifications — not least in support for the EU.  

&gt;Mr Barnier’s push for realism at a meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday was met by a retort from Belgium that fishermen in its city of Bruges can claim rights in British waters in perpetuity because of “a privilege” granted by King Charles II of England in 1666. Diplomats insisted the remark was made in jest, even if it showed the historical depth of fishing ties. 

&gt;Under international law, countries’ sovereign fishing waters — known as exclusive economic zones — stretch as far as 200 nautical miles from the coast, or less if they bump up against another country’s EEZ first. One consequence of Brexit is that the UK will reclaim its own EEZ, removing those waters from EU fisheries management.  

&gt;Under the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, waters are pooled, and fishing rights in different areas are allocated to national fleets using a longstanding formula. 

&gt;Diplomats noted that fishing rights enjoyed up to now by the UK in the residual EU EEZ are worth around a fifth of those enjoyed by the EU27 in UK waters.

&gt;According to data from the UK’s Marine Management Organisation, between 2012 and 2016, the UK fleet landed an annual average of 94,000 tonnes of fish per year valued at £106m from the EU27 EEZ; the EU27 fleet, by comparison, landed an average of 739,000 tonnes per year, worth £521m, from UK waters over the same period.  

&gt;Among the valuable species caught by UK fishing boats in EU27 waters are sole, plaice and mackerel. 

&gt;A UK official said the gap between the two sides in the future relationship talks remained “significant” both in terms of fishing quotas and access. “We are not going to do a deal that sells out the UK fishing industry as in 1973,” the official said, in a reference to the negotiations that preceded the UK’s accession to the European Economic Community.  

&gt;“The EU must realise the current arrangements are going to change one way or another. There needs to be more realism from the EU and urgently.” 

&gt;The official pointed to comments from David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, earlier this week when he stressed that EU fleets net nearly half the fish caught in UK waters and that this needs to change.",,/r/europe/comments/j7ve1t/brussels_looks_to_divvy_up_old_uk_fishing_rights/g876dnk/,salvibalvi,1602233025

My sons mother is from Poland, a little city in the North called Słupsk. I visited some 5 times, very fond memories, always good weather, very cheap living. The first and second time I visit, in the centre there was a large beer garden. The bar was a pop up 'Tyskie' dome surrounded undead by benches and umbrellas. The first time I sat there I noticed a lot of BMWs and Mercedes pulling up and men in leather jackets standing about taking. I asked my lady what was going on and she whispers ""Mafia"". I say ""Holy shit, mafia"" and she ""shhhhhhs"" me hard. Anyway, first two times we visit, I spend a fair but of time enjoying pints of Tyskie in the warm weather there.

The third time, it was gone. I ask her mum where the Tyskie dome went and she tells me the Church didn't approve of the Mafia conducting their business in front of the church, so away it went.

Regarding health, if the health system works thanks to the private sector, it is not logical that the state asks you to pay taxes once you are abroad, since technically speaking, these taxes do not bring you anything and do not allow you to access any service since everything belongs to the private sector (school/hospital/...).

400,"I didn’t realise our European forum was filled with American Islamic extremists. 

Is your head under the sand? In Europe we know all about what Ilhan and her best mate erdogan are about. 

Our actual security is at risk because of that psychopathic extremist, whose father has ties to war crimes in Somalia.

People in Armenia are still dying.. Greece and Cyprus is still threatened.

And Mrs “some people did something” is busy taking funds from extremist organisations and having private sit downs with erdogan. When did she become a foreign minister? Oh wait - she needs funds for her “campaigns” - guess who is funding her?

Take your head out the sand. She is infiltrating the most powerful nation on earth - and who pays for it? Fucking Europe - not the USA. Cause the USA just has to make one stupid policy with her support and destabilise eastern Mediterranean security. Obviously none of this even matters in the USA.  Turkey is agressive in mediteranean? Who cares in the USA right... America first - far away (trump). Then Biden must play nice with his super woke base. In the end europe loses both ways so long as she is influencing policy. One side it’s not their concern the other side also doesn’t care, because she is part of their “group”. To be fair to Biden I don’t think he will take her seriously. But she is still holding an important position.

Sorry - I don’t give two shits about the US political scene. But CAIR also has funding from turkey as well as hezbollah. Just because you don’t care, doesn’t mean we don’t care. But supporting that woman is disgusting.

Lebanon Beirut blast had stockpiles from Hezbollah blow up - they found the same materials confiscated in London Germany and Cyprus circulated through Hezbollah. 

She is dangerous. And more dangerous to Europe than anyone else. 

She is full blown Turkish support, support from extremist Islamic groups in a very volatile time for Europe, with Turkish aggression rising..

Macron is starting to push back. But Ilhan Omar is in no way good for Europe.

Stop being a one party zealot - just because you don’t like the other side doesn’t mean everyone on your side is good.

469,"Croatia is great for dining. Outstanding quality, variety and value. Try peka! Try a winery tour. Croatian wine is excellent. Croatia is by far my favorite country for food (sorry Greece, Japan &amp; France), but my vegetarian friend didn't appreciate it as much. 

Croatian choral singing is also a great and really wonderful cultural experience. In Hvar, we found a tiny choral singing concert at a church and it was amazing. Walking along the waterfront in Hvar is lovely in the evening. From Hvar, we took at day trip to Zlatni Rat, Brač. In Split, we saw a performance in the dome of the castle and the acoustics were amazing. That was a free performance because they were selling CDs, but it was incredible.

A day trip to the Kornatis from Zadar might be fun. Boating and sailing is huge in Croatia, so that's something to look into.

Vis is underrated as a destination because it's pretty far. But we enjoyed it a lot. If you visit the blue cave, be sure to book from a local company in Komiza and avoid it altogether during the busiest times. But if you can get in without too much of a wait, it's fun. We booked a tour of the old military tunnels on Vis and it was really interesting, although not exactly romantic. 

I skipped Dubronik, but if you go, google cruise ship schedules ahead of time and avoid the days when a lot of people are arriving. 

Krka was lovely. We chose to rent a car for the day and that was a good call because, unlike a bus tour, we got to set our own schedule and drive to different entrances skipping the time-consuming boat ride part of the park. Instead, take the much shorter boat ride to Visovac and drive up to Roski Slap. Krka is also big for hiking and cycling.

There are so many choices of things to do in Croatia, it really depends on what is romantic for you. I spent 10 days there and was disappointed by nothing, but there is so much you have to plan and prioritize.",,/r/europe/comments/j79jzz/tourist_map_of_croatia/g86nzi1/,Candelent,1602215511

549,"&gt;That's the point, 'parts of the world' is an irrelevant concept in this context. The US has its entirely own, but fingers in all the pies everywhere, we have reached unprecedented levels of globalization. And even then that's false, there is a recent escalation in the Caucasus, which is still Europe-ish, and then there's Turkey too. Not that having 'one understanding' is necessarily a good thing. The guys that drank poisoned kool-aid had it too.

I never said Russia or any other country/power should not have interests here or there, but from the EU's perspective, 3rd countries should not play a role when it comes to membership discussion. Especially when it's countries like Russia which obviously isn't interested in becoming one and in fact, quite clearly treats EU as a rival bloc, hence, it has no *bona fide* in it at all.

And yes, anti-Americanism does produce a few goals because the USA does create shit once in a while, but they're more like a broken clock being correct twice a day, than actually anything meaningful.

&gt;Do you have a compulsion to go on tenuously related rants every time you reply to me or something? You were on topic in two sentences, but the rest is just a tirade about how we are completely doomed, tangentially relevant at best. Not the first time either.

I honestly don't remember the last time I replied to you, but these are honest thoughts about Russia's foreign policy. I have no other ways to put it, it's just crappy and convinces absolutely nobody in Russia's neighbourhood to cooperate with Moscow. Conflicts and different understandings are not unheard of, but how can Russia just continue to justify the shit even when it's not only out of the European club, even its culturally and historically by far the closest neighbours are alienating? It's like everything is to be blamed apart from Russia being on a wrong path.

I don't even see a glimpse of chance of cooperation happening with that country at this point, at least as long as Putin rules it. Let's be honest, Baltic-Russian tensions are not just geopolitical, they're also historical. But even on that front, Putin has just reverted to Stalinism. It was easier back then, when the world consisted of heroic liberators and evil fascists. Belarusians, who might just have the highest genuine sympathy for Russia, are pushed an illegitimate dictator down their throat. Hence, it's no surprise the solution I promote is to just exclude Russia from European affairs altogether.

I don't believe Russia is doomed, but I do believe that idiotic anti-Western ideology is doomed. It offers no viable alternatives to Western democracy, especially when propping up stagnating illegitimate dictatorships, it inspires nobody, and it isn't doing any favours for Russia either.",Eesti,/r/europe/comments/j7avet/zelenskyy_ukraine_wants_a_stepbystep_plan_towards/g864wpx/,toreon,1602204414

565,"You should read about ""Foundations of Geopolitics,"" the standard textbook used in the Russian military.

Putin invaded Ukraine because they elected a leader he didn't like. He also lied about invading Ukraine.

If Belarus successfully removes Lukashenko, he'll invade Belarus too. He won't hesitate. He'll be there the next morning, and he'll lie about it.

I have lived in Latvia, and I speak Russian. Putin's propaganda is there *in full force.* Russian news sources constantly tell lies about life in Latvia, they claim Russians are oppressed, they claim Russians are not allowed to learn Russian in schools, and they find it offensive that ethnic Russians in Latvia are supposed to learn Latvian, despite living in Latvia. Older Russians living in Latvia flat out refuse to learn Latvian. There are many cities and regions with majority-Russian populations, like Daugavpils. The Latvian government has asked schools run by ethnic Russians to teach the Latvian language, and they responded by screaming ""Oppression!"" which is backed up by the Russian media.

Putin considers the soviet breakup to have been a geopolitical disaster. They regard all of the former Soviet countries and Warsaw Pact countries as stolen Russian territory. You're naive if you think Russia will not annex the Baltic states (EU members) at the first opportunity. Putin already put a moron in the White House who doesn't support NATO or multilateralism.

In recent history, countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary held peaceful demonstrations to try and leave the Soviet Union. The Soviets responded with tanks and death.

766,"Guys..   

It’s not a clash between the two as the title suggests.  It’s a brutal attack and an effort to defend.  

I can’t tell you how much it hurts to watch this.   Me, my family and everyone Armenian we knew became refugees in 1988-1990 because Azeris began a series of Pogroms, ethnically cleansing their country of Armenians because the Armenians who have always lived in NK dared to ask for independence (for historical context, Azerbaijan consistently cut off essential supplies and resources to the region and people were fed up).  The land was only drawn to be within their border 100 years ago and they claim it’s occupied... our people have been there for millennia as a vast majority.

And now as refugees in our new homes for 30 years we have to watch their brutal and pathetic leadership attempt to consolidate power by spreading hate and now warfare.  Absolutely unacceptable and I wish Russia would act like the big dog they’re supposed to be on the area.  

Thankfully our people have learned how to defend their land after century after century of Persians, romans, mongols and Turkish conquest efforts.  

Please keep your perspective clear and don’t allow bad actors to cloud your judgment.

827,"You're probably downvoted by Turkish posters but I agree with some of what you say.

While Mustafa Kemal and other founders in Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) and Young Turks was most likely influenced by the mainstream nationalist trend in Europe in late 19th-early 20th century and their thoughts of fascism and necessity to create an ethnic/nation-based identity was further shaped by the break up of empire into nation states in bloody Balkan Wars and civil wars, the new republic was based mostly on Italian fascism and loosely on Soviet Bolshevism. From Falih Rifki Atay, an influential journalist, writer and politician of the era and a member of Mustafa Kemal's inner circle, to Feridun Fikri Dusunsel, an influential lawmaker, politician and a leading member of Republican People's Party (CHP) of the era, many leading opinion leaders and influencers of the era suggest the Italian fascist model as the right model for the new republic to be based on. According to Falih Rifki Atay, the new republic must be a mix between fascism and communism and a model of such republics which transitioned from the old model to the new one.  According to many elites of the era (many of which were people who worked with Mustafa Kemal and his inner circle), fascism was the elite philosophy of the era and Mussolini in Italy was a true patriot.   
   
Early in his career, Adolf Hitler also took great inspiration from Mussolini and his fascism. According to historian Stefan Ihrig's works [1](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674368378), [2](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674504790) and other early Turkish republic sources, he also drew great inspiration from Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and the way Turkish republic was founded, especially since both Germany and Ottoman Empire fought as allies in WWI but Turkey managed to get back to its feet (and got rid of its ""problematic"" Greek and Armenian minorities in the process) which he thought should be great inspiration for Germany.  
  
Also following the partition of the empire into nation states, the founders of the republic had to rally up the remaining Ottoman Muslims around a new identity and they chose Turkism and Turkic identity as the forefathers of Seljuks to band the muslims around it. Most of them were convert muslim immigrants from elsewhere but it didn't matter. They needed an identity to create a nation state and they started to implement a Turkification process where people were to re-learn their Turkic roots from central Asia (even Bosnian, Circassian, Georgian, Albanian, Jewish converts to Islam) and reformism where people were to reject Arabic and Farsi alphabet and switch to latin to become ""modern"" Turks and reject the past, and distort to past in order to create a new past of the ""imagined nation"" to create the ensuing real nation state.  
   
I agree with your second paragraph:  
  
&gt;WW2 happened, the western world move on but turkey did not experience that ruin first hand so it remained as a problematic interwar country with a problematic democracy that was eventually hijacked by a populist with delusions of grandeur so no surprises there   
   
That's correct. Staying out of WWII allowed Turkey to fly under the radar while all other fascist republics collapsed following WWII, either evolving into liberal democracies in the West or being forced to assimilate into communist Soviet bloc. Turkey continued with the same 1920s fascist model to this day. That's why Turks are serial deniers of historical events and are programmed to defend their state as nationalists all the time.",,/r/europe/comments/j78n74/turkish_lira_hits_record_low_on_geopolitical/g84u1a4/,urbanjihad,1602181987

952,"&gt;Attacked and killed protesters with their cars, most immediately. 

Cars? When did that get plural? Heck, I'm not even sure that the Dodge Challenger guy intended to hit anyone in the first place, considering his car was under attack (as can be seen in the video) and he might've just panicked. That being said, it's not like I've shifted through the court documents and so forth, so I'm not declaring myself certain by any means.

&gt;That being said, their primary avenues of violence (including political violence) are carried out through the state,by joining law enforcement groups and abusing those positions with inappropriate force.

Don't attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence. Also, I don't know how often you read rightwing news or rightwing social media, but what you're describing isn't a thing. It's not done. There isn't a culture of, ""I'mma go join the police force so I can beat me some minorities!""

Heck, even on far-right/alt-right websites, I haven't seen such things (granted, it's not like I make a habit of visiting Stormfront, but still). Hateful crap, sure, lotta that, but not so much people who say they're going to join the police to oppress people.

What does ""shooting passively noncompliant pedestrians and motorists"" mean?

&gt;(from local, state and federal executive positions) obstructing life-saving public health measures are all recent examples.

That's rather vague.

&gt;There's also the occasional right-wing terror attack

From the people at Free Speech rallies or Trump rallies?

Also, I'm fairly sure I've heard of at least one far-right terror attack, but I can't remember it off the top of my head, so could you give me an example?

&gt;dangerous, poorly organized militias.

You mean like Antifa?

Only 1.3% of abortions in the US (easiest to get statistics on) are in the third trimester, and the majority of those are for medical reasons, and there are very few (don’t have an exact number) states that allow third trimester abortions for non-medical reasons and even then they’re very limited.

1103,"&gt; Once a rising star of the European economy, Spain is on a path to becoming its problem child—and the latest example of why global investors should tread carefully around Southern European stocks.  
&gt;  
&gt;This week, the latest readings of the purchasing managers index published by [IHS Markit](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/INFO) confirmed two trends. The first is that global manufacturing activity is recovering at a much faster pace than services. The second is that, among big developed countries, Spain seems to be in particular trouble.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pandemic has made these polls of companies more difficult to interpret than usual. Still, they show Spain performing worse than its European peers, including Italy, which was the economic laggard coming into the crisis and was worse hit by the first wave of Covid-19 cases.  
&gt;  
&gt; pain has been unable to contain the spread of the virus. In the spring, officials took too long to act, only to later establish the strictest of lockdowns. Unlike Italy, the country then tried to return to normal too fast—its leader of health emergencies went abroad on vacation just weeks after advising against travel between provinces. Infection rates rebounded sharply in the summer, such that Spain accounted for one-third of Europe’s daily Covid-19 cases. Now, Madrid is one of the region’s hardest-hit cities, and new measures that directly impact the services sector [have been enacted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-second-covid-19-wave-rolls-through-europe-deaths-and-hospitalizations-rise-11601919564).  The structure of Spain’s economy, which enjoyed a growth spurt between 2015 and 2019, explains why it is at risk now. Tourism directly accounts for 12% of Spanish gross domestic product—more than any other member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development—and employs 14% of the population.   
&gt;  
&gt; Official figures suggest that half of the one million jobs lost during the depths of the outbreak have already been recovered. But there are an additional 735,000 [being propped up](https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-the-surface-of-pristine-job-numbers-pain-awaits-europe-too-11598011672) by subsidized furlough programs. Many are tourism-related roles that will probably disappear as soon as support ceases. The real unemployment rate is likely well above 20%, rather than the official 15%.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the medium term, what is even more important for all economies is how much money consumers have once the pandemic is over. Reduced earnings could depress demand for years and even cause a double-dip recession. In the U.S., an expansion of unemployment subsidies and stimulus checks led personal income to increase more than 10% in the second quarter even as people lost their jobs. In Southern Europe and Spain in particular, by contrast, income losses have been very steep, Oxford Economics analyst Ángel Talavera has pointed out.  
&gt;  
&gt; The reason is that these governments have been less willing or able to widen their budget deficits by opening their purses, despite [support from the European Central Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecbs-christine-lagarde-is-prepared-to-inject-fresh-stimulus-cut-rates-11601973358). While Oxford Economics forecasts a rebound in Spanish personal income in the third quarter, the economic gap with richer nations is likely to widen from here. European reconstruction funds will probably arrive too late—over the past week, governance questions have put the timing further at risk—and won’t fix Spain’s overreliance on relatively unproductive industries like tourism.  
&gt;  
&gt;A big question for investors over the past few months has been whether to tilt their portfolios from the U.S. to Europe. The pain in Spain is a warning of the dangers involved.",,/r/europe/comments/j7c4wk/spain_becomes_europes_weak_link/g83ovd6/,free_thinker001,1602160223

1267,"The EU has the power to stop NS2, but doesn't want to - it wants Germany to stop it. It was talked about in 2019, to rescind the permissions for the project, but instead the commission decided on new restrictions instead of a stop. My assumption is that the EU parliament doesn't want a clear position on the issue, because either it might force the EU to act and cancel it or because there might not be a majority for the EU to cancel it - that's why it's never being voted on directly.

Maybe let me first point to my own position on the issue. I think the project (NS2) shouldn't have started, but now that it's near completed, Germany should not stop it anymore. I'd be highly supportive of the EU (or any of the necessary transit states) removing the permissions to build the pipeline, as this would stop the project. I'm pretty sure that position is also held by Merkel and others ;[

Why do I want it this way? Well simply, because the project was greenlit by the EU, by other states and is now near completion - if Germany cancels it, the German taxpayer would have to foot the bill of 10+ billion €. That's what I'm primarily opposed to - I am neither positively nor negatively impacted by the pipeline, but I'd be very negatively impacted if Germany cancels it now. Yet that's also why I think the EU parliament doesn't want a vote on it and why the EU commission doesn't want to cancel the project - if they cancel it, they are liable for the damages.

So Germany doesn't want to halt it and says, ""if the EU truly wants to cancel it, they can and should do so"". Vice versa, several countries and (maybe - without a vote and with it not being done in the past, it's unsure) the majority in the EP and commission want the project to be stopped, but they don't want to stop it themselves, basically saying Germany should cancel it. It's both sides trying to pass the bucket to the other about who would have to pay the price for cancelling it now and I'm fully well supportive of the German position.",Hesse (Germany),/r/europe/comments/j6ndtf/polish_watchdog_fines_gazprom_76_billion_over/g83hjxf/,MilkaC0w,1602153758

The government doesnt want to pay for the increased costs of importing food caused by the tariffs and trade restrictions. The locals cant afford the increased cost, because many lost their incomes because of the trade war. So if you cant fix it by self sufficiency the only remaining answer is to move some of the soldiers (and their families, and associated support personnel) out of the militarized enclave. Which kinda defeats the point of a militarized enclave.

So yes. There is a blockade, an economic one.

(There is also the issue of what would happen if Russia were to try anything silly in say Byelorussia, as any shipments can be easily cut off with missile systems stationed in Poland or Lithuania.

1519,"&gt;I’ve never understood why men seem to care so much more than women about fetuses, but then have much higher rates of death penalty approval and war approval.

Because abortion, at least in their eyes, involves the deliberate killing of innocent people. Do you think it's utterly inconsistent to be against killing innocent people, but at the same time support executing criminals like Anders Brevik or killing in the course of combat (such as in war)? 

&gt;The inability to remove oneself from the bubble of their own existence and have some sympathy for another person’s experience, like being pregnant and unable to support a baby, is remarkable.

Well, suppose a mother kills her already born child, because she realizes that she can't really support the baby. Now suppose someone telling people to cut that mother some slack, because she couldn't support the baby anyway, and that being a mother is really hard. 

Do you think this is a legitimate excuse to kill an already born child? Probably not.

1521,"Between 2010 and the second quarter of 2011, house prices and rents in the EU27 followed similar paths. Then, since the third quarter of 2011, they have followed very different paths: while rents increased steadily throughout the period up to the second quarter of 2020, house prices have fluctuated significantly.

After a sharp decline between the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2013, house prices remained more or less stable between 2013 and 2014. Then, there was a rapid rise in early 2015, since when house prices have increased at a much faster pace than rents.

Over the period 2010 until the second quarter of 2020, rents increased by 14.2% and house prices by 25.0%.

When comparing the second quarter of 2020 with 2010, house prices increased more than rents in 16 EU Member States. House prices increased in 23 Member States and decreased in four, with the highest rises in Estonia (+100.5%), Luxembourg (+85.8%), Latvia (+77.3%) and Austria (+75.9%). Decreases were observed in Greece\* (-31.0%), Italy (-13.2%), Spain (-5.6%) and Cyprus (-3.0%).

For rents, the pattern was different. When comparing the second quarter of 2020 with 2010, prices increased in 25 EU Member States and decreased in two, with the highest rises in Estonia (+135.8%), Lithuania (+105.4%) and Ireland (+62.3%). Decreases were recorded in Greece (-25.2%) and Cyprus (-4.8%).

Attacked and killed protesters with their cars, most immediately. 

That being said, their primary avenues of violence (including political violence) are carried out through the state, by joining law enforcement groups and abusing those positions with inappropriate force. Detaining kids in camps, forcibly sterilizing migrant women, beating, tazing and shooting passively noncompliant pedestrians and motorists, and (from local, state and federal executive positions) obstructing life-saving public health measures are all recent examples.

There's also the occasional right-wing terror attack, and an abundance of dangerous, poorly organized militias.

Most broadly, they support a candidate (Trump) who engages in stochastic terror, has personally encouraged political violence at his rallies, encourages and emboldens violent right-wing hate groups, and whose COVID response is responsible for more deaths than the Civil War (on both sides).

1613,"&gt;Throughout its post-1991 history, KO was never able to fully cover its basic needs when it comes to essential food products.

I don't understand the significance of this.  You have ports, so you can bring in food.  Unless you're expecting a naval blockade and land borders closed, why do you care about food self-sufficiency?  As long as you've the wealth and physical ability to bring in food, it should be a non-issue.

*googles*

https://www.mannlines.com/containers-ports-kaliningrad.html

&gt; Kaliningrad Sea Commercial Port has by far the best facilities for shippers of containerised and general cargo to and from Kaliningrad, including substantial warehousing and cold storage facilities. 

They've obviously got people bringing in food via ship.

Hawaii isn't food self-sufficient, but what of it?  It imports food, and it's a lot further away from the rest of the US than Kaliningrad is from the rest of Russia.

&gt;Kaliningrad Oblast was hit particularly hard in 2014 when it comes to food security. Most locals consider the food commodities sector a crucial “strategic branch of the local economy”

So…Russia banned imports of food from Kaliningrad's neighbors and it created problems for Kaliningrad.   That sounds like a self-created problem.

&gt; Second, despite huge expectations, the import-substitution strategy for the oblast has failed to achieve food autarky—a critical component from a military-political standpoint—leaving KO still dependent on external players.

Edit: 

“The communist partisans ""liberated"" Valtetsi in May 1944 under the command of kapetan Fotis Gatsopoulos. Immediately he gave orders to confiscate the church and the main houses to make their own headquarters. For the EAM members, Valtetsi was considered a royalist stronghold because only a few people accepted to be named as Village Guardians. Immediately they started to chase down those persons who were known for having relatives abroad, mainly the ones in the United States that were labelled as reactionaries or monarcho-fascists. When an order of massive execution was given the whole population rebelled against the partisans and expelled them from the village.[9]

In the morning of July 15, 1944, a strong battle between the communist andartes and the Valtetsiotes took place. The villagers, peasants and shepherds fought against the communist forces but outnumbered and badly equipped were defeated. The communists recaptured the village and burned nearly a half of the houses. They gathered most of the population taken prisoners in the church's yard and started shooting with no distinction of men, women and children. Most of the population was decimated. By the time the Hellenic Army freed the village a couple of months later, Valtetsi was about to become a ghost place.[10]”",,/r/europe/comments/j6mrvt/a_large_crowd_has_gathered_outside_the_court/g82pseg/,seal_raider,1602127381

&gt;What impact will this phenomenon have on the eventual resolution of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict? The answer to this question will depend on how this conflict is resolved. If it is resolved militarily, then without a doubt this propaganda will serve both states in their recruitment efforts for a new war. The younger generation will be sent to their death (or “martyrdom”) more easily. The irreconcilable approach toward the enemy will be easily justified and those who advocated a milder approach will be easily condemned for their “naiveté and foolishness.” But if the conflict is resolved peacefully, then the implementation of this resolution will be under question. How will the state leaders who, thanks to their propaganda machines used to slam the “enemy” in every suitable occasion, sell the new peace offer to their respective publics? How can an eternal enemy become a friend overnight? How easy will it be for radio and TV shows, newspaper and internet articles to change their rhetoric? How long will it take to review our history books and stop portraying each other as eternal enemies? Obviously, this will not be easy.

The US, Russia, and France have tried to figure out a way forward since the mid-90s with diplomatic engagements and resolutions put forth in the early 2000s:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Process_(Armenian%E2%80%93Azerbaijani_negotiations)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Principles

Here in LA, the protests that have occurred by our large Armenian community have been to 'raise awareness' to get CNN to cover it. Similar users on other subreddits have asked ""What do you want us to do about it, especially given the state of the US?"". The EU has a lot more leverage, as does NATO, over how this goes but Turkey seems committed on flexing their muscles (Libya, Syria, etc) and who knows what Russia will decided to do. But yeah, 'bad neighborhood' and a conflict which will see innocent lives lost. 

There's also another potential territory that could get involved called [Nakhchivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic) wedged between Turkey and Armenia that recognizes itself as part of Azerbaijan where things could start up again.

1721,"&gt; I would protest it

Why? Knowing the history behind those statues, I can't imagine you saying this in good faith. I'm going to assume you haven't read the link, or aren't aware of the history at all, so I can't say you're a neo-Confederate. But if you read the history behind them and still feel the same way, well, that's a different story.

&gt;where moral outrage ranges supreme and people try to censor each and every thing they don't like

""Moral outrage"" over racism isn't a big deal. It used to be that people tolerated things like the Confederate flag, but now that people are largely aware of [revisionist nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy), this argument gets weaker and weaker.

So yeah, if ""things people don't like"" include statues that were made to intimidate black people during the Civil Rights era, then I think we're moving in the right direction. If you don't feel the same, too bad.


&gt;Some people just don't think you should be tearing cultural monuments down

Do you honestly believe that any and all ""cultural monuments"" should stay up, no matter what? I'd guess you'd protest people trying to take down a statue of Bin Laden at ground zero, right? What's the difference here?

Shit, just calling it a ""cultural monument"" is disingenuous in and of itself, but moving on....

&gt;It ain't just black and white

It....really is. If there was anything, *anything at all*, that was ""black and white"", it would be ""should this statue glorifying Hitler remain in a public square for all time?"" I honestly can't think of a more black and white situation than this, tbh. You're really going to try to inject moral grayness into this hypothetical?

Explain this. Go ahead, I want you to explain to me how the side wanting to keep the statue could have merit in a potential Hitler monument hypothetical.

&gt;Are you insinuating that my position is that you can't be a neo-Nazi and also protest the removal of a statue

If you're protesting the removal of a statue of Hitler, how can you not be a neo-Nazi? Is this really what we've come to, that blatant neo-Nazi positions (defending Nazi iconography and memorabilia) are now not actually indicators of one's political position?

I guess I have to ask this again; what position would one have to defend a statue of Hitler, while also not being either:

1. Disingenuous (it's their cultural heritage!!!)

2. An outright Nazi?

Seriously, this is the hill you're dying on? One of the most black and white scenarios ever?

&gt;it doesn't matter.

It does matter, and to say it doesn't makes me think you have some agenda to push. They were put there to intimidate African Americans. It's like putting up a statue of Nazi officers in a Jewish neighborhood. Would you support that?

&gt;Why do you think it has any relevance to my position?

Because I'm trying to assume that you're arguing in good faith. If you know the history behind these statues, and yet you still don't care, my options become limited as to why you'd support keeping them up.

Imagine going up to a Jewish person protesting some Nazi monument, and telling them ""oh well, this statue is a cultural monument. Stop trying to censor things you don't like."" I'd think you were a Nazi, tbh. In fact, I think most people would. So, what's the difference between the above scenario, and Confederate statues?

1725,"&gt;Nowadays it is very hard to have such conversations in respect.  

We agree on that at least. 

&gt;He has joined some operations to kill civilians with ASALA. This is my point. ""What Monte did was wrong but he is our national in Armenia"", ""What Safarov did was right but he is our national in Azerbaijan"" is same logic for me. To be honest Azerbaijani Turks don't talk much about Safarov but I have seen that Armenians are promoting Monte. 

My first point is that while Monte Melkonian was at one point in time a member of ASALA, he is not known for that (in fact most Armenians don't even know he was a part of ASALA). He is mostly known for his actions in Karabakh, which is why so many Armenians honor him. Ask any Armenian who knows about ASALA what they think about it and they will tell you they don't even consider them as Armenians (seeing as how they assassinated anyone they disagreed with, including many prominent intellectuals). My second point is that Monte Melkonian is loved despite the horrible things that happened, while Safarov is loved because of the horrible things that happened. Its kind of like how in the US, George Washington is loved despite the fact that he owned slaves, because he was also a founding father. Its similar to how Melkonian is loved despite the fact that he was once a part of ASALA, because he was a fighter in Karabakh. Meanwhile what has Safarov done outside of killing the Armenian? What is he known for besides that? Is he celebrated for some other reason?

After they won the war in 1992 they ethnically cleansed the region from the Azeris, NY Times puts the number estimate around 600,000. To put this into perspective, Karabakh today only has a population of 125,000. 

Even Armenia itself used to agree that in a possible solution the surrounding areas would belong to Azerbaijan, in the last 10 years they stopped. Instead they started to settle their own citizens in the surrounding areas as well. 

This ethnic cleansing of 600 thousand people didn't happen a century ago or something. It happened just 28 years ago and most people that were displaced are still alive and they demand their homes back. They are, no matter how you look at it, morally AND legally right. Even the UN istelf demanded unconditional retreat of the Armenian forces. 

The only way Armenia can possibly justify their position is by showing this conflict as a Armenia-Turkey conflict rather than an Armenian-Azerbaijan one.

The problem is that high volume of articles does not been high quality, and a disturbingly large number of articles with extremely dubious, even fradulent information has been coming out of China in recent years, at least in the Biomedical and Pharmacological fields.

Since they fail the standard peer review process, they are often found in the growing number of low-impact factor journals that spring up suddenly, are online only, have unverifiable credentials and cater almost exclusively to particular interests. These generally use no peer review and require only payment for publication, and often disappear only to spring up under a different name. They're by no means unique to China or its research, but a huge number of Chinese articles go through them.

In particular there has been a surge in articles concerning Traditional Chinese Medicine that use unreliable methodologies that don't hold up to peer review and can often be found to be using duplicate or altered data. They're almost uniformly written wholly for the purpose of legitimising some part of TCM and are part of a much greater propaganda effort that can be seen in various formats from Chinese diplomatic pressure for the WHO to recognise TCM to these articles.",,/r/europe/comments/j6u231/the_most_innovative_economies_in_the_world/g82aae4/,A6M_Zero,1602119159

So while DK does not have an Amazon or a Google, we do have several of the worlds leading pharma, bioscience and medical equipment companies, as well as the world leader in hydraulics, several of the most cutting edge producers of building materials, windmills, robots for industrial uses and plastics. A danish company also developed the most advanced slant-drilling technologies for off-shore oil rigs and  the targeting radar in the F35 Lightning fighter jet. Denmark, again - with only 5,8 million people – also regularly build its own satellites or satellite subsystems, developed and produced the currently NATO best-in-class frigate (the Absalom-class frigate), the world’s best municipal heating systems and a large proportion of the most used industrial enzymes.

It did eventually bite the British/French in the ass though (leeching money off the empire with the debt bondage and stopping Russia from taking Constantinople in the later 19th century wars) with poor leadership and underestimation of the Ottomans at Gallipoli - the reforms that had been made through the 19th century plus German support had made a big difference (plus its really hard to take the objective the allies were going for, as anyone whos ever visited there has seen).

Pick one from the hundreds of books and articles discussing hate speech, free speech and the legality thereof within the scope of social sciences. Feel free to google ""hate speech"" if you need to educate yourself. Or take a look at Finnish law (e.g. article 11 of the penal code) if you need examples that hit closer to home. See also


You are shifting the burden of proof, that's a logical fallacy. I asked you to tell me your definition of ""hatred"", why will you not do it? 

-

&gt;See, this is where it shows you are not arguing in good faith. Someone arguing in good faith would grasp that eg article 7 deals with discrimination. I.e. acts of hatred.


You still have not told me what you mean by ""hatred"", therefore I can not know whether ""acts of hatred"" are supposed to be synonymous with ""discrimination"". 


-

&gt;That's not the point when talking about a concept. Whether you call it hate or discrimination or racism is irrelevant.


We are talking about *law* here, so using the the precise term matters. If you mean discrimination, you should use the word ""discrimination"", not the word ""hate"" or ""racism"". 

-

&gt;My definition is the same as the definition of every other free-thinking human being in the world: the definition as amalgamated through laws, human rights, and academic literature.


Why don't you provide this definition, then? Do you not know it? 

-

&gt;Your bad faith argument makes no sense. Asking others to define ""hate"" in this context is as stupid as asking someone to define ""math"" in the context of astrophysics.


If you say that something should be banned because of ""hate"", you have to define ""hate"", just as you have to define ""theft"" or ""murder"".

-

&gt;And what does criticism of religious figures have to do with anything


Many people consider it ""hate speech"". In my country it is illegal to say: ""Muhammad was a pedophile"".  

-

&gt; You are defending fascists when you are saying that there is no definition of ""hate"". 


I am not saying that. You are the one who says that legal terms like ""hate"" should not be clearly defined. 

-

&gt;You're essentially defending someone's right to shout ""fire!"" in a cinema. Which is just... weird.

However women made up a higher percentage of people than men when asked if they strongly opposed abortion. 

This squares with my anecdotal observation of when I see pictures of abortion and anti-abortion rallies, it skews overwhelmingly female, regardless of which side is protesting. It's highly valuable for the pro-choice movement to portray the issue as a male v. female issue, because it supercharges their base while delegitimizing the views of women who are pro-life.

2185,"&gt; Azerbaijan Reportedly Convert Ancient AN-2 Biplanes into Drones [bait for armenian air defense; to localize it)

&gt; Azeri forces have alleged converted old Soviet-era AN-2s into drones, flying them over the conflict zone of Nagorno-Karabakh as apparent surface to air missile bait.

Half a dozen Azeri AN-2s have been recorded being shot down over the contested territory of Nagorno-Karabakh last week as the intense fighting in the region raged. The aircraft, which are hopelessly obsolete for modern war, seem to be just flying to their deaths, but there is likely an intelligent play behind them. Footage released shows the aircraft flying low and slow, and in one instance tracer fire from various weapons can be seen flying all around.

Armenian air defense forces downed what appears to be yet another Azerbaijani An-2 (possibly converted into an UAV). 

The AN-2, which has been in the service of a multitude of nations since 1946, is a light aircraft intended to serve in many roles. But militarily is used for light transport and paratroopers. In 2020, it appears a new self-destructive role has been found for the dozens of AN-2s still with the Azerbaijan Air Force. It appears the aircraft are being easily shot down by Armenian air defenses, but in doing so, their positions are revealed to much more modern and significantly deadlier drones.

However, images from crash sites leave questions about if these aircraft are just mindless drones. Whilst no pilots have been found, one image shows an unexploded bomb amongst the wreckage. It is likely that while these aircraft are sent on suicide missions, they still intend to cause damage.

Despite high losses, satellite footage from Yevlax airport in Azerbaijan shows approximately 62 airframes on the ground. Meaning that the Azeris are unlikely to run out of aircraft before their adversaries run out of air defense platforms beyond MANPADS and anti-aircraft guns.

The latest satellite imagery suggests that a significant number of the AN-2s at Yevlax airport have left with just 26 aircraft currently visible. How many have been deployed operationally and how many may have been lost is unclear.

The An-2 ""UAV's"" fleet at Yevlakh Airport Azerbaijan is very active. August 28th, 2020, 61 aircraft could be counted on the ground whereas October 3rd, 2020 only 26 aircraft could be spotted. It is unknown how many were destroyed and how many are currently flying. GEOINT

The Azeris are likely to continue to use their AN-2s as these old airframes are seen as largely useless and decisively obsolete. Their loss means little and the potential return of their use as decoy drones to lure out Armenian air defenses far outweighs their loss.",,/r/europe/comments/j5juiy/armenia_and_azerbaijan_clash_in_the_disputed/g80n7vb/,watdyasay,1602088931

Lmao how is that ""purely political"" if Gazprom and other mentioned companies **asked themselves** OUKiK for the approval for the concentration back in 2015.

Read [here](https://www.uokik.gov.pl/aktualnosci.php?news_id=16648), translation of the most important part:

&gt; In 2015, the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection received an application from six companies for consent to establish a joint undertaking responsible for the construction and operation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. reservations. In 2016, the Office issued objections to the concentration, in which it presented objections and concluded that the planned transaction could lead to a restriction of competition. The entrepreneurs withdrew their application, which in practice meant that the merger was prohibited. Meanwhile, soon thereafter, information appeared in the media that the would-be participants in the transaction had signed a contract for financing the gas pipeline. Therefore, proceedings were initiated against Gazprom and its five contractors for the transaction without the consent of the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection.

&gt; ""Gazprom's attitude undoubtedly made our conduct difficult, but the Russian company did not manage to block it. We have sufficient evidence and we are completing its analysis. This means that the end of the precedent procedure for the creation of a consortium responsible for financing Nord Stream 2 without the consent of the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection is getting closer"", says Tomasz Chróstny, President of the Office.

&gt; There is a penalty of up to 10% of the entrepreneur's annual turnover for violating the ban on concentration without the consent of the President of UOKiK. Moreover, if the concentration has been completed and the restoration of competition on the market is not possible, the President of the Office may order the sale of all or part of the entrepreneur's property, shares or stocks ensuring control over the entrepreneur, as well as the dissolution of the company over which the entrepreneurs exercise joint control.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/j6ndtf/polish_watchdog_fines_gazprom_76_billion_over/g808ela/,antropod00,1602081511

2277,"&gt;The U.K. government will pull out of Brexit trade negotiations with the European Union next week if there is no clear deal in sight, according to a person familiar with the matter.

&gt;The British pound reversed gains, and declined as much as 0.3% to $1.2846.

&gt;Boris Johnson has said he wants the outlines of a deal to be clear by Oct. 15. EU officials, however, have said they won’t be pressured into making concessions and are prepared to call the prime minister’s bluff if he doesn’t compromise, effectively daring Johnson to walk away.

&gt;A person familiar with the British position said Johnson’s team would indeed pull the plug on talks if no clear landing zone for a deal has been identified by that date.


&gt;The analysis adds to pressure on the talks which are resuming in London.

&gt;After talks with the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday, the two sides agreed to intensify negotiations.


&gt;But two key stumbling blocks to a deal remain -- over whether the U.K. will stick to EU competition rules governing state subsidies and on fishing rights for European countries in British waters.

&gt;Unless there is a clear deal in sight by mid-month, Johnson has previously threatened to move on from the negotiations and prepare to exit the bloc’s single market and customs union on Dec. 31 without an agreement.

&gt;On Tuesday, a senior EU diplomat warned that the bloc had no plans to offer concessions to meet Johnson’s deadline, and would be ready to call his bluff.

&gt;Speaking about those comments, the person familiar with the British position said the government was serious about walking out next week.",,/r/europe/comments/j6rlt5/uk_plans_to_quit_brexit_talks_if_no_deal_clear/g808fbb/,ApresMatch,1602081521

2) Xenophobia, anti-Russia or anti-Turkey speeches are dragging us down and preventing us from building social and geopolitical stability for ourselves.

The uneducated don't decide on those matters - usually, it's the matter of constitutional law. Look up the principles governing your country, look what they entail in national and international literature, legal systems and case law and then you plead your case whether a party is intolerant.

2478,"&gt; After the referendum in the Crimea, a pro-Russian rally was held in Odessa, Ukrainian nationalists drove some of the protesters into an empty building and burned 48 people alive.

Even the articles that you've linked paint a very different picture of Russian instigators shooting and throwing explosives at the Ukrainians:

""The first person to die was 27-year-old Igor Ivanov, a pro-Ukraine member of the extreme nationalist organisation Right Sector. He was gunned down on Odessa’s main street, Deribasovskaya, lined with cafes, bars and restaurants and usually thronged with tourists.

The head of the local pro-Ukraine Maidan self-defence group, Dmitry Gumenyuk, recalled the effect of the homemade grenades, fashioned by taping bolts and nails to firecrackers. “One of ours was very badly injured. They threw a smoke flare and he started to gasp for breath and broke ranks. When he let down his shield they threw a grenade and it exploded under his bullet-proof vest and four nails entered his lungs,” he said.

In clear evidence of police complicity, video footage from these clashes shows a pro-Russia activist, shielded by police, shooting with a modified AK-47. Dmitry Fuchedzhi, a deputy police chief in Odessa reportedly known as ”Uncle Dima” to pro-Russia activists, was said to have been seen mingling with shooters.""

In response to that locals managed to encircle them and force to barricade inside a building where the fire eventually started and killed some of them.

Again, this wasn't nationalists burning people alive. This was locals defending their city from foreign instigators who were shooting and throwing bombs at them. That instigation was also part of the ongoing invasion to the South and East of Odesa and similar ones were successfully carried out by Russians in Donetsk and Lughansk.",Ukraine,/r/europe/comments/j6ldye/language_map_of_ukraine_2001_census/g7znnp9/,Morfolk,1602067228

2) Famine is the result of the policy of the Bolsheviks (political term), not the Russians (ethnic term). No wonder Ukrainian nationalists do not like to name the names of specific people who made certain decisions. The famine affected not only the territory of the Ukrainian SSR. Half of the victims of the famine are Russians, Kazakhs, and the peoples of the Caucasus. After the famine in the East of the Ukrainian SSR, where the ""Russian-Ukrainians"" lived, they began to bring Ukrainians from the Central regions of the Ukrainian SSR.

3) the Crimean Tatars themselves settled the Crimea with a Christian population, capturing millions of slaves in Russia and Poland.

2700,"In 2019, the share of early leavers from education and training in the EU stood at 10.2%. In other words, one in ten individuals aged 18-24 years with at most a lower secondary level of educational attainment (ISCED 0 - 2) was not engaged in any further education and training in the four weeks preceding the survey.

The Europe 2020 target is to reduce the rates of early school leaving in the EU to below 10% by 2020. In 2019, this share was already below 10% in a majority of regions (NUTS level 2) with some of the lowest shares concentrated in eastern Europe and in capital regions.

Among the EU regions, the lowest share of early leavers from education and training (1.7%) was recorded in the coastal/island region of Jadranska Hrvatska (Croatia). There were three other regions where no more than 1 in 50 young people were early leavers: the capital regions of Czechia and Lithuania — Prague and Sostinės regionas (both 1.9%) — and the Greek region of Kentriki Makedonia (2.0%).

The highest regional shares of early leavers from education and training were often concentrated in island and/or peripheral regions of the EU, where it is likely that a disproportionately high share of students have to leave home if they wish to follow a particular tertiary education course or programme, leaving behind a higher concentration of early leavers.

The share of early leavers from education and training was also relatively high in most of southern Europe and across most of Bulgaria and Romania. The southeastern Bulgarian region of Yugoiztochen had the highest share of early leavers, at 27.2% in 2019.

Although the proportion of early leavers from education and training was comparatively quite low in western EU Member States, their former industrial heartlands often recorded higher shares, for example: Province de Liège (Belgium) or Nord-Pas de Calais (France).

2709,"&gt; Can people stop pretend that anything is about „UN resolutions“?

There are General Assembly resolutions and Security Council resolutions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution

&gt; Although General Assembly resolutions are generally non-binding towards member states, internal resolutions may be binding on the operation of the General Assembly itself, for example with regard to budgetary and procedural matters. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_resolution

&gt; Resolutions by the Security Council are legally binding.

The resolutions in question appear to be from the Security Council.

United Nations Founding Treaty:

&gt; Article 25
&gt;
&gt;The Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the present Charter.

-

&gt;Article 39
&gt;
&gt;The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.
&gt;
&gt;Article 40
&gt;
&gt;In order to prevent an aggravation of the situation, the Security Council may, before making the recommendations or deciding upon the measures provided for in Article 39, call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable. Such provisional measures shall be without prejudice to the rights, claims, or position of the parties concerned. The Security Council shall duly take account of failure to comply with such provisional measures.
&gt;
&gt;Article 41
&gt;
&gt;The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.
&gt;
&gt;Article 42
&gt;
&gt;Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.

Now, I'm not going to say that that the resolutions in question, which I have not read, are being violated.  But if the UNSC passes a resolution, that means that at minimum the world's major military powers have all agreed that X is going to happen and that if it doesn't happen, they have a green light to make it happen via whatever means they choose, including economic action or force.  So I would probably care about Security Council resolutions, because they represent consensus positions by the world powers.  They are a warning, a line in the sand beyond which things can get unpleasant.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/j69qse/turkish_cypriot_prime_minister_says_varosha_beach/g7z2k30/,duisThias,1602045375

&amp;#x200B;

For example, the ruling party lost most of the big cities in Turkey a year and a half ago - this is due to the fact that our elections are still legit. You can still compete with, and win against the AKP. Hell, at least for İstanbul, we even had debates between the top two mayoral candidates last year, which hasn't happened in forever. They were about as solid as the 2016 American Presidential debates, but hey, that's still 100x better than no debate. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the problem, honestly, is that the main opposition party is just weak. They have most of the same corruption problems historically as the AKP, plus (and while they don't go for it now, they lost old people because) they used to do stupid shit like ban headscarves in universities and government jobs. Maybe that sounds good to some Atheist European, but in practice, that just makes people mad, and it excludes them from higher education and good jobs. Most people aren't going to take their headscarf off to do things, they'll just not participate, and become bitter.

&amp;#x200B;

The Turkish opposition party seriously was weak in the past, and they're still not amazing, they finally found some stronger candidates, which is why they took many big cities, plus people are getting fed up with 20 years of the same, and that same is starting to absolutely tank the country. AKP stayed in power so long because they could convince the people the economy was good. and from 2003-2012ish it was good, Turkey was one of the least affected countries by the global recession, etc, but since then there's been like 0 real growth. Until 2018ish people could be convinced the economy was decent, but after that, it really started to crumble, and now it's basically in shambles.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/j5juiy/armenia_and_azerbaijan_clash_in_the_disputed/g7z32q2/,alexfrancisburchard,1602045755

2885,"It seems to me this war planned, agreed on, and settled long time ago.

No real negotiations will happen while Nikol is in charge. Right now, Nikol is scared shitless, and sending everyone to frontlines. Russia is promising help, but vaguely. Russia wants Nikol to keep sending infantry into trenches, with no heavy weapons against Azerbaijani artillery.

Right now Azerbaijan is pretty much mops up Armenian re-enforcements as they arrive, battalion by battalion. Azerbaijan is not even using Air Force. Azerbaijan is simply using the cheapest possible way to exterminate enemy soldiers. If enemy is not coming, Army advances and keeps pounding.

Russia needs high number of Armenian deaths, high enough for Armenian people to curse and chase Nikol away. Pro-Russian ""Savior of Armenia from Genocide"" moves in, Russian Army immediately arrives and bravely stops Azerbaijani from entering Armenia proper to ""avenge Ganja"". Also, Russia says strong words to Turkey not to kill poor Armenians. Azerbaijan and Turkey promise not to invade Armenia, ""but they really really wanted to"".

Armenia rejoices, she is saved from ""Genocide"". Erdogan wins next elections as Father of All Turks. Aliyev The Liberator is undisputed Leader of Azerbaijan for a long time, wins any elections forever.

And Putin gets his real estate back. 146% pro-Russian Armenia.

So, 2nd Karabagh War is pretty much over, now it is a regime change in Armenia. Everyone wins, except Nikol. Three experienced politicians played pro-West idealist like a violin. Triple-A Machiavellian political intrigue. Bonus material: they made Macron look like a fool who spreads fake information.

The tragedy is the slaughter of Armenian youth, but even Armenians think they are dispensable.

2922,"&gt; Not true, Scotland played massive role in the creation of the empire. Scottish merchants and colonial officers were spread all over Asia and Africa. For example, Scottish officers and businessmen played a disproportionate role in the opium trade with China.

I agree with that, but I was referring to the population of commoners, the average working farmer that settled in the New World, not the middle-class tradesmen or army officers. In ancestry, English is the biggest group in Canada and Australia (and it was the biggest ancestry group in the USA until the 1980s). This is due to simple math, Scotland's population is still very tiny today, England always had more people and therefore more colonists too.


&gt;Modern Scots law was heavily influenced by the Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie

Well, frankly you appear to know more than me, but they're still distinct enough systems that Scottish Lawyers and English Lawyers receive different types of education and training, and most of Britain's colonies opted to directly copy the English legal system (which is why a lot of American Founding Fathers were Oxford or Cambridge educated lawyers, as opposed to St Andrew's, Edinburgh or Glasgow)",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/j65f62/500_years_of_european_colonialism_in_one_animated/g7yer7x/,SeleucusNikator1,1602031182

The reality is that all of the Dutch language area is quite diverse culturally and linguistically and currently both the Netherlands and Flanders are asymmetrically skewed (politically/economically) towards Holland and Antwerpen/Vlaanderen respectively. Not to mention how weak the position of Dutch in Belgium has been historically since the establishment of the Belgian state. Wallonian votes still weigh heavier at the federal elections.

I recall reading something from the 1980s saying that satellite communication had higher latency than undersea cable and was generally undesirable for this reason.

I don't know what altitude those satellites operated at, but I'd expect cables to normally be preferable from a latency standpoint.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/firearms-act-twenty-years-has-it-made-difference-dunblane-port-arthur-a8110911.html 

*Squires is professor of criminology and public policy at the University of Brighton, and has written and lectured widely on the issue of gun control. If Dunblane was a game-changer, does that follow that the Firearms Act was as well?

“Perhaps not necessarily at first,” he says. “In fact, **for the next four years gun crime continued to increase, by about 105 per cent over that period**.”


**But that doesn’t mean it was a failure. The reason gun crime continued to rise was because the definition was too wide-ranging; it included everything and anything, every single report where a victim reported that a gun was used, even if that gun was never fired, even if it was a replica, or a fake, or even a toy.** So by 2003, the laws were refined.

The use of air weapons and pellet guns, which made up a large number of gun crime complaints, was taken out of the Firearms Act and put under the auspices of the new Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, which meant gun crime figures purely under their Firearms Act definition began to decrease markedly thanks to reclassification taking air weapons out of the equation.

...


In the years before the act was commenced, Home Office statistics show that homicides involving firearms were 75 in 1993, the same in 1994, and 81 in 1995. Aside from spikes around the turn of the century, the subsequent years have all seen markedly lower gun-deaths recorded.

The Gun Control Network, a campaigning body set up in the wake of Dunblane, records its own gun-death statistics based on media reports, which it says generally tally with official figures once they come out. For the past few years it has reported 20 deaths in 2014-15, 24 in 2015-16, 27 in 2016-17, and since 1 April this year, 15 deaths in England, Wales and Scotland.

**So the act does in fact seem to have made a difference**.*",,/r/europe/comments/j67lu0/homicide_and_firearm_homicide_rate_per_100000/g7xnslb/,Mkwdr,1602016420

3165,"I don't deny the fact that Europeans can be racist from time to time which is not quite surprising due to the nature of modern humans.

I've met many many people that respected my country, my flag, my culture and Atatürk, that are all around the world. Due to the current state in our government its true that some nations are offended which I totally understand. Like I said I think we should all hate governments and not people. But again, due to my shitty fucking government, Europeans(or any citizen from a Christian country) tends to hate our people. Erdoğan literally opened Hagia Sophia which was the biggest disaster for both us and Christian people.

It was a massive disrespect and a huge loss of culture. So what did a Greek person say? ""Man fuck the Turkish government and its people."" because there's so much hate in them they don't know what to say. So they automatically hate the people. Which I understand but still highly dislike.

There are lots of Turkish immigrants living in Germany like kings but also disturbing their peace. So they slowly grow hate for Turks. Its just human nature.

Us Turks for example, start to dislike the refugees living in our country. Why? They get better health care, they have more money than actual citizens that can't provide Internet for their kids' school. So what happens? We grow hate and want them to leave us be.

I agree with you about how they deny the genocides they've done but that doesn't mean shit. They can deny all they want, what difference does it make? Sure I'll always dislike that fact but what's done is done.

I acknowledge the fact that peace seems impossible. Not amongst government but people. Everbody is just pointing guns at each other. Talking about the things we had or another country has one in the past. That's not going to help us one bit.

Some german guy comes and jokes about France surrendiring, someone brings up the Armenian genocide once again, a jew talks about how he still hates Germany for the holocaust that happened years ago and it goes on. Politics and war has been a thing for thousands of years and every country has done bad things so there are infinite negative things to talk about. But instead we should put these things down for a sec and just talk about other stuff you know.

3234,"&gt; If you think the argument is ""We don't want the French fishing cod in their own waters"" You're either being willfully blind or arguing in bad faith.

Nice try. No cigar.

&gt; The entire argument is preventing EU (mainly french I believe) fishermen from entering UK waters and fishing without our leave.

I don't know how else to say this to you, as I have tried twice, and did not seem to register. So, I will try one last time:

* Most of the species in question are migratory

* This means that they move around

* As an example, a large percentage of the North Sea cod hatch and spend their juvenile time off the coast of Denmark and Germany

* As they grow, they move around further, ending up in the UK EEZ (not waters) at some point

* They don't need to be fished in the UK EEZ - they can be fished *before* they make it to the UK EEZ

* This would not be good for anyone, because it means that more juveniles would be caught (the fish are younger)

Also, look up the difference between EEZ and Territorial waters - you're confusing the two. There's a good explanation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone): 

&gt; The difference between the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone is that the first confers full sovereignty over the waters, whereas the second is merely a ""sovereign right"" which refers to the coastal state's rights below the surface of the sea. The surface waters, as can be seen in the map, are international waters.

Meaning: the UK can't stop anyone to enter those waters, as they're not UK territory.",På lang slik er alt midlertidig,/r/europe/comments/j51e8w/eustice_will_fight_eu_fishing_trawlers_if_brexit/g7x6sf7/,KvalitetstidEnsam,1602009255

3239,"&gt; It wasn't left to UN alone and it can't solve it alone. What a silly comment.

I'm simply replying in kind to the quality of comment that I have been recipient of.

&gt; Sure, except for the... you know.. facts. Feel free to name a period in human history when human rights were more valued? Go on? Just because things don't change overnight does not mean things don't change.

They aren't valued now in any way that is significantly different from any other time, it's simply that society is packaged differently. The only thing that really changes is which colour bow you wrap the parcel in.

- If life was valued then why are economies being prioritised over eliminating coronavirus? The value of a life is currently in effect lower than the next starbucks coffee purchase.
- If freedom of speech/opinion etc were valued, then why do we have all these ""hate speech"" agendas kicking around. An assault, a murder, or a burglary etc are still those things with the same consequence regardless of motive. Legislation like this is just a stick to beat people with and criminalise for having the wrong opinion on facebook or wherever.
- If privacy is valued, why do we consistently spy on our own citizens.
- If democracy is valued, why do governments gerrymander and bend electoral voting rules to be more favourable to them.

These are all western issues I've listed above. Much worse everywhere else.

&gt; Yet fact is that they are the only ones that can potentially make a difference. But feel free to explain your idea on how to make a change? Bomb them?

Yet the fact is they will do absolutely nothing.

How do you know Flemish culture is oh so Germanic? From all Germanic cultures, Flemish culture definitely has the most Romance influence. Because obviously, you're gonna have a close culture with your neighbours. 

That's why you make a good point with Champage, Lorraine and Picardy. Ofcourse Wallonia is gonna have a close connection with them, because they're neighbours. Flanders has a close connection with Nord Pas De Calais. Closer than with any Dutch region besides Limburg. Does that make Flanders closer to French culture than to the Walloons too?

How about Provence? Aren't they very close to Italian culture? Should they therefor break of and join Italy? No, because they are still closer with the neighbouring parts of France. I'm sure you, as a French person, see that. What about Switzerland? Surely, the French speaking part, the German speaking part and the Italian speaking part are culturally close to the neighbouring regions within France, Germany and Italy respectively. Does that mean Switzerland should disband and that they aren't also close to each other within Switzerland? No, ofcourse not.

And the same goes for Belgium. My historic examples are ones that I made to underline that Wallonia and Flanders have already spent centuries together under different rulers before Belgium.

In north africa half of Libya and all of Algeria are massively opposed to the EU. Egypt meanwhile might not join especially since due to the importance of the Suez canal other countries would bribe them not to. Its also far to unstable for it to worth the risk of an alliance for the EU.

In west Asia Syria, Iran, and iraq would all flat out refuse to join while turkey would be a untrustworthy ally. Any dela that included isreal alongside the arab countries would also just flat out collapse.

So that leaves Tunisia and Morocco both of wich are already two of the EUs closest allies. Lebanon where an alliance would only serve to increase tensions within the country. And the gulf states who give there citizens about as much human rights as North Korea.

3396,"It really doesn't have to be 'hot city' as such. I live in Łódź, and my apartment building is well insulated. If it's 30-35*C for a day or two, it stays comfortably cool inside. The issues start when it's warm for weeks at the time. Not only does building itself heat up, in surrounding area there are other large apartment buildings made out of concrete, and while there is some green terrain arround it's still mostly roads, parking lots etc. so mostly asphalt and paving. That's massive thermal mass in itself that gets heated during a day and cools down during night, basically ensuring temperature at night doesn't really drop much. Even rain doesn't help that much unless it really pours for hours.

Insulation only slows down the process, and sadly as I mentioned it works the other way around too. Once the equilibrium sets at high temperatures it can actually take couple days for the inside to cool back down. Obviously opening all the windows helps here.

Now, my summer home is also well insulated and happens to be on a hill, in the middle of very large forest area between bunch of lakes... and that's different story. For obvious reasons I'm happily retreating into countryside during summer whenever I can, but being 30 minutes drive away from any civilization (and even that's not exactly the same as big city), and 4 hours away from my work doesn't  make it viable option to commute either.

Honestly the gist of a problem is what I said in first sentence: it's not 'hot city', but it absolutely can get very hot here, and it's happening more and more in recent years... and more importantly for longer.

If you're against something primarily because it disgust you, you act out of instinct, and don't bother checking if you are actually fair.
When you are against something because you looked into the situation, and see who is hurting and who isn't, then it is the *unfairness* what disgusts you.

3502,"&gt;The wife and kids that you love finding out you had a family because it's ""what people do"" 

I truly don't see how coming out as gay somehow negates a man's love for his family if he has one. Sure the woman might feel sad if she was only in it for the sex (which would be weird to have established such a relationship given the facts but whatever) she would feel hurt. But children etc. should not be affected at all, gay men can love their children just the same as any other man.

&gt;the lads nights where a few of your mates rip on the gays

probably not a good group of lads tbh

&gt;he office job where your colleagues see you as the family man who enjoys sport and where any weakness might actually be used against you

a gay man with a family is still a family man, being gay is not a weakness

&gt;the life insurance policy you've been paying into for years based on you being a heterosexual man in that family

don't know how things work where you are from but I've never heard of life insurance policies being tied to your sex life

&gt;the casual chats where you never discuss music choices because you know you're not into the right stuff

gay people do not have separate music tastes from other people... I feel like you have a very narrow and strict view of what a gay person is... anyone can have any kind of music taste

&gt;you are cold towards, even though they're decent, because you feel ""the thing that is not allowed"" 

this is real and a result of a culture of homophobia but has very little to do with children's cartoons tbh. I never saw LGBT stuff as a child but never had problems with it as a grown up because the adult culture wasn't focused around homophobia

Pashinyan tried to sell out to NATO, but it didn’t work out for Armenia so well, did it? 

He made a grave error in trying to sit on two chairs simultaneously(CSTO and NATO). Unfortunately, the legs on NATO chair ended up being too weak to support his ass. The result?

That means £110,05 per MWH in 2019 or 11 pence per kWh.

In that case, while the overall more efficient production is still 2X + 2Y, the exchange is unequal - if, say, X is finished goods and Y is raw materials, and the exchange value is 1Y being worth 0.5X, then the final result is actually:

By the end of the year, the Armenian countryside had dozens of deserted villages that had been depopulated of most of Armenia’s more than 200,000 Azerbaijanis and Muslim Kurds.15

Also, there were **NOT** mass movement of Armenians after the 1988 Sumgait pogroms. The mass expulsion of Armenians from Azerbaijan happened after 1990. The events described in the transcript is occurred two whole years before the pogrom you talking about.

**The timeline is**:

1. 1988: NK protest, with Azerbaijani people leaving NK
2. 1988: Sumgait pogrom of 1988
3. 1988: Pogroms against and complete deportation of Azerbaijanis from Armenia (200k)

***“Let’s go to help our brothers, the Armenians, because they are Christians.”***

For the trip to Artsakh, he was informed by the Armenian Social Cultural Center that “we will go by air. As far as I know, some airports flying to Armenia have not been closed. I do not know anything more, except that as soon as you get there, the conscription takes over.”

Are there any conditions to be accepted, Sputnik Hellas asked the volunteer?

“We were told that they want you to have your ID with you and a doctor’s certificate certifying that you are in very good health and in good physical condition. Then the one responsible for taking you takes over responsibilities,” he said.

Kleftogianni said he got annoyed when asked if he was scared when he thinks that on the battlefield he may have his last breath.

“No, I am not scared. I’m not afraid of anyone. Why should I be afraid? For my life? I only fear God. I’m not afraid because I’m trained. It is like telling me that there will be a war in Greece with Turkey and I will go and hide in my basement. Ma’am, you are not talking to someone by chance. All I have to say, my last words would be ‘good luck to the Armenian people,’ because the Armenian believes in God, is Christian Orthodox and gives up everything to defend their homeland. What are our people doing? Tell me! Very well, because with the recent tension, I was on alert too,” the volunteer said.

The volunteer also heard that there are minors from Greece who want to go to Artsakh.

“They are too young to take part in such a thing and I would not risk it. You cannot send to war a man who has never held a weapon in his life. You never risk this thing. Because I have done both in Kosovo and Afghanistan and I have seen with my own eyes minors holding guns, I know it is wrong. That’s all I know,” the volunteer explained.

***“They want our lands – I’m not afraid to lose my life”***

Sputnik Hellas met with 16-year-old Greek-Armenian, Armen Panoutsarian, at the Armenian rally in Syntagma on Wednesday.

Although he has not finished school and has never held a gun in his hand, he will try to reach Artsakh through the Armenian embassy.

“I think it is my duty. I will go to fight for the existence of Armenia tomorrow. I want to live and know that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow my second homeland will still exist, because there are some who believe that the whole world is theirs. The Turks do not want Armenia to exist,” he explained to Kleftogianni.

His mom, next to him, waving an Armenian flag, seemed upset, but does she let him go?

“Of course. She also wants to go if she has to fight,” said her son.

Kleftogianni asked her and the mother confirmed it.

“Armenia has no reason to go to war,” Armen continues. “It simply came to our attention then. They want our lands. Azerbaijan is Erdogan’s puppet. I’m not afraid to lose my life. And if I lose it, I know it is worth it. I would fight the same for Greece.”

The 27 year old Ellinoarmenis Mars, who works at a call center has not yet made the move to transition in Armenia.

“I will speak to the embassy as soon as I see that the time has come. I will go to support. I have done military service. I have a gun in my hand. There is chaos in \[Artsakh\]. A war is raging. Both Armenians and Azeris are firing from both sides. There are losses on both sides. It is simply an unequal battle. If we put the numbers down, obviously the Armenians are much less in number and budget. Anyone from Greece can help. Although it is not the only way \[…\] It is the love for the Armenian nation. You want to be over there,” he said in a calm voice, wearing a red mask with words embroidered in Armenian.

***“I think it is worth dying for Armenia”***

“All the families, and mine, were definitely scared when I told them I wanted to go to \[Artsakh\]. We do not know how things will turn out. Okay, there is fear for sure, and I’m afraid I might be killed. Have I fought to know how to fight? Just because I have a gun in my hand in the past does not mean I know. But I have only one thing on my mind: To help, as children much younger than me will do. I think it is worth dying for Armenia. Especially when you were born and raised away from her, like me.”

His close friend, the 26-year-old insurer Vangelis, also born in Athens and a Greek-Armenian, will go to Artsakh, “although I do not know how to fight, I have done service in the Greek Navy because I grew up with my parents telling me that we have another homeland. We are certainly Greeks and Greek citizens, but we also love our second homeland. I may have only been to Armenia twice, but I consider it my homeland.”

“It is difficult to go to \[Artsakh\] by road, because you have to make a big circle to get there. The Azeris have closed the border. The trip is done by air. The fact that about 600 people have stated that they want to go does not mean that they have been taken. I also do what I can through social media. We must get rid of the daily propaganda of Turkey and Azerbaijan. It is a dirty war. Is it a coincidence that the US embassy in Azerbaijan said that all Americans should stay indoors? They knew what would happen,” he said.

&gt; 2. The Assembly expresses its concern that the military action, and the widespread ethnic hostilities which preceded it, led to large-scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of mono-ethnic areas which resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansing. The Assembly reaffirms that independence and secession of a regional territory from a state may only be achieved through a lawful and peaceful process based on the democratic support of the inhabitants of such territory and not in the wake of an armed conflict leading to ethnic expulsion and the de facto annexation of such territory to another state. The Assembly reiterates that the occupation of foreign territory by a member state constitutes a grave violation of that state’s obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and reaffirms the right of displaced persons from the area of conflict to return to their homes safely and with dignity.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/j5juiy/armenia_and_azerbaijan_clash_in_the_disputed/g7vlwyn/,yokedici,1601973013

3704,"&gt;Libertarianism is not suited for emerging economies and it can only be afforded in europe due to the exploitation of the second and third world.

I mean its not suited for China, because China isnt libertarian, if thats what you're getting at. And as for the exploitation of second and third world world countries, i mean, i dont know how to respnd to your anachronistic views, other than to say they dovetail nicely with your party's ideology (yeah, i know you;re a chink bot) of 'West bad, they exploited other countries, Opium wars bla bla bla'. Yeah, whats done is done, and i see your party doing exactly the same to Africa, so just relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It's the cause for decline of civilization not in the rise and you cannot expect second or third world countries to go along with that decline.

I dont know what stuff they have you reading over there, but libertarianism and humanism are core principles of any self respecting nation who cares about the human. I dont expect you to agree, since you have several million of your fellow citizens locked up in internment camps, but why dont you ask your fellow citizens jumping at the chance to live in these so called 'declining civilizations'?. Im sure they'd be more than happy to tell you why they'd rather live in a country that respects their basic freedoms.

3833,"You’re Lithuanian, no? You don’t have experience of wealth before globalisation.

It’s impossible to separate globalisation and neoliberalism because they came together as mainstream ideas in western politics and the ideologies are intimately intertwined. Much of the harm of globalisation has come down to neoliberal policy being adopted at the same time. We knew that low skilled jobs would be lost, and let it happen, because that’s what the market would make happen. We cut social welfare at the same time and continually since, further making life hard for those hurt by globalisation, to be competitive.

The argument that inequality is OK as long as life gets better for all is not inherently flawed but there is little argument that life is better for all. The lower classes in Western Europe and the US earn less than they did several decades ago, and our government services have been cut back severely. Economic growth is stagnant because internal demand has collapsed due to the squeeze on the lower and middle, and we can’t buy houses anymore. To tell people suffering from that that they should shut up because they have a cheaper phone is gross.

There are benefits to globalisation but economic vibrancy in the west has unquestionably taken a large hit since that agenda took hold and neoliberalism itself is a poisonous ideology that has brought nothing to the 99%. Defending our economic policy since the 1980s as if it hasn’t brought our economies into serious trouble is insane.

&gt;Mission

&gt;The European Public Prosecutor’s Office will be an independent and decentralised prosecution office of the European Union, with the competence to investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment crimes against the EU budget, such as fraud, corruption or serious cross-border VAT fraud. The Regulation establishing the European Public Prosecutor’s Office under enhanced cooperation was adopted on 12 October 2017 and entered into force on 20 November 2017. At this stage, there are 22 participating EU countries.

&gt;Currently, only national authorities can investigate and prosecute fraud against the EU budget. But their powers stop at national borders. Existing EU-bodies such as Eurojust, Europol and the EU's anti-fraud office (OLAF) lack the necessary powers to carry out criminal investigations and prosecutions.",EU Earth Union,/r/europe/comments/j5oid9/open_letter_to_the_european_parliament_call_out/g7v98dl/,syoxsk,1601960092

Secondly, they were about as equivalent to today's antifa 'decentralized mob' as it's possible to get...

4007,"First of all and just to be clear here, I differentiate between gay people and gay people who associate themselves with LGBT. Reason behind this is that throughout my life, I have gotten to know multiple gay people. Most of them I wouldn't have known they were gay, if they hadn't told me that themselves. On the other hand, there were a few who were 'proud members' of the LGBT movement. Those people I didn't even have to ask them about their sexuality, because it was in most cases one of the first things they would mention, when you are getting to know them. Also, the way they dress, their haircuts and even the way they talk and interact with other people just screamed 'I am a member of the LGBT'. Whether you agree on this differentiation or not, is of course up to you, but I just wanted to get this out of the way.

To answer your question, having a 'gay personality' is simply when somebody would put his sexuality above everything else. There is a difference between basing your personality on your life achievements, intellectuality or even career path, because those are things that you work toward during your entire life and keep on developing them. Being gay however, should never be the core of someone's personality, since it is something biological, something that you were born with and didn't actively chose or work toward. It is also something that (at least in my opinion) shouldn't be mentioned in professional environments, or only mentioned when they are relevant to the circumstances.

Imagine if somebody came to you and most of his discussions were revolved around his face bone structure or eye color. It would be just very shallow and off-putting for most people, because such topics don't need to be the main focus of almost any discussion and they mostly are just too self-centered. This is the same with sexuality, since it is something you don't really need to tell everyone about it all the time and even use it sometimes as an excuse for certain behavior or acts.",,/r/europe/comments/j5lyux/pride_parade_once_again_wrocław_poland_03102020/g7uxdxd/,Alpha_9,1601951915

4085,"It is a difficult subject for me, I understand what you are getting at, I even agree to a certain degree but not fully.

For example, you say that sexuality shouldn't be a personality trait and we should develop our personalities into something outside of what we were born into, I agree but it's more complicated than that. Our experiences, achievements,  the way we develop is also deeply connect to our sexuality. Most of the times not because we want it to be, but because other people make it that way. The bullying, and side comments, the opportunities we lose, these are our experiences, and we use these experiences to grow. Some learn to hide it better, like I did, others take the aggressive route and own up to it. Neither is wrong, both are the results of the experiences we've had. It's simply a defense mechanism we build around us, some toughen up while others are more discreet. So to say that sexuality is a personality trait is partially true, but we most take in consideration that the reason why it is that way is because of the amount of external factors. 

And yeah, some people are really into the whole bone structure, crazy hair styles and colours but that can be found everywhere. 1.To assume that gay guy's are the only ones to do that is a bit naive. 2. Who cares.

As for the not telling people in a professional setting, I think it should really be up to the person. When I was working I got asked so often ""If I had a girlfriend, did I want kids, do I want to get married"" I would just wave it off since I always hated small talk but if I had told people it would've saved me the torture of listening to these questions. Worst was hearing the homophobic comments my coworkers would say. That was just gut wrenching knowing who wanted you to not have the same rights they did.

So we either get people to stop doing small talk (please non existing god make it happen), or we just listen to people criticising us.

It's a complicated issue, in my opinion, you do you boo, as long as you aren't hurting anyone I don't care. Wanna talk about the last season of Ru Paul drag race? go ahead, I didn't watch it but if it makes you happy then do it. Wanna bleach you hair? perfect.

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/05/azerbaijan-dropping-cluster-bombs-civilian-areas-war-armenia/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/05/azerbaijan-dropping-cluster-bombs-civilian-areas-war-armenia/)

&gt;Azerbaijan has been dropping cluster munitions in civilian areas  during its war with Armenian forces in the breakaway republic of Nagorno  Karabakh.  
&gt;  
&gt;The munitions, which scatter tiny bomblets over a wide area, are  banned under a global treaty because of the risk they pose to civilians,  especially children.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the Daily Telegraph saw them being used during [heavy shelling this weekend in the city of Stepanakert](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/04/third-generation-seeing-war-shells-rain-nagorno-karabakh-civilian/), the capital of Nagorno Karabakh.  
&gt;  
&gt;On a downtown street full of shops and housing blocks, large  quantities of the bomblets - small cylindrical tubes about the size of a  film can - were left scattered on the concrete. Several had failed to  explode, posing an ongoing risk to passers-by. The bomblets are  considered a particular hazard to children, who often mistake them for  toys and pick them up.",,/r/europe/comments/j5juiy/armenia_and_azerbaijan_clash_in_the_disputed/g7ujtn2/,iok,1601944284

4180,"&gt;I don’t see the downside?

The classic downside is that if country A is better at making product X than country B, while country B is better at making Y than country A, it's overall better for both countries if they make what they're good at and trade with each other.

Assuming each country is twice as good at making their special product, has an input of 1 effort which can be used to produce either 2 of their speciality or 1 of their non-speciality, and would ideally like 1X and 1Y:

* specialisation &amp; free trade: A produces 2X with 1 input, B produces 2Y with 1 input =&gt; total production of both countries = 2X + 2Y, and they can trade surpluses for A(1X + 1Y), B(1X + 1Y).

* protectionism: A produces 1X with 0.5 input, 0.5Y with 0.5 input, B produces 0.5Y with 0.5 input, 1X with 0.5 input =&gt; total production of both countries = 1.5X + 1.5Y, no trade:Y A(1X + 0.5Y), B(0.5X + 1Y)

As you can see, both countries are better off if they specialise and trade. However, the EU isn't one country, but a market of 27, so it's a little more complicated. Obviously there's plenty of room *within* the EU for specialisation and internal trade - and indeed most EU trade is intra-EU - but it's worth noting that some of the needed specialisations are things that imply low-wage hard manual jobs, so you have to consider that by supporting specialising solely *within* the EU, you are thereby supporting economic inequality within the EU.",Ireland/EU,/r/europe/comments/j5lnyd/the_revenge_of_strategic_yogurt_how_the_eu/g7uo42f/,Bowgentle,1601946653

My girlfriend plays video games, yet she's not on Reddit, she doesn't read gaming news, she doesn't watch games on youtube and only hears about gaming stuff from me, basically..yet she plays on her own time and out of her own desire to do so. You could call her a gamer, but she's not part of the ""gaming community"". Does she share the same ""hive mind"" gamer mentality that people here on Reddit seem to share? No, she doesn't get memes if I show them to her and she doesn't understand inside jokes or have an understanding of the industry. Yet she's a gamer, and there are times when she actually completes more games than me, despite me being a hardcore gamer who takes an active role in the community on Reddit and youtube. So she's a gamer, but she doesn't share the general gamer identity and probably doesn't see herself as a gamer, really. People are just people. Society used to slap a label on homosexual people so some of them decided to form communities where they felt accepted and fought together for equality, no wonders they slapped another label on themselves..yet you can totally find gay people who have never been to a pride, don't wear shiny clothes and maybe are even politically right wing..because they're just people. Their sexuality is not an identity for them as long as no one gives them a reason for it to become so important.

Let's say tomorrow heterosexuality was banned from your country, and you were forced to split up with your SO by law. Wouldn't you riot, and feel bad, and feel angry, and feel betrayed, wouldn't you fight to have back the right to love who you goddamn want? Give it a few months and that fight might actually become part of your identity, because it'd be so important for you. This is what these people often go through. And they are a big chunk of humans on earth..some studies say 1% of people, other say up to even 10%.

Milosevic strongly supported coup in Soviet Union (Vladimirom Krjučkov &amp; Dmitriji Jazov) against Yeltsin. Coup meant to safe territorial integrity of SSSR. Of course it failed, Soviet Union failed and that was one of first 90s mistake of Milosevic, he wasn't aware communism is dying. The second mistake it shows how badly he wanted to keep Yugoslavia was Slovenia fiasco (keep in mind there were almost no Serbs in Slovenia). Of course to counterargument your statement about him being Serbian nationalist was that he put on sanctions against Bosnian Serbs in 1994. which really screwed them up over there, not to mention him being involved into selling weapons - oil to both sides of the war there through connections with Bosnian politicians at the time.

4360,"First, how exactly is gay a personality? 

Second,  whether they want to hang a pride flag or not really has nothing to do with it. I don't either because I like my privacy but for those that do put a flag up are providing visibility to the lgbt community. In a world where we are the minority visibility is important. It makes a stance that we exist and people can't just push us into a nice little dark corner.

Third, good on you not to care whether they are gay or not, it shouldn't matter, but for many it does. Homophobes with nothing better to do aren't exactly happy that gay people can get married and adopt children and lead normal lives because ""they are sinners that will root in hell."" 

This is the reason why we still parade, to remember people that we do exist, to remember that not everywhere in the world is safe for people like us.

4431,"&gt;The only preposterous thing here is the idea that “an American couldn’t possibly have done anything important because well I just hate America so much I just can’t believe it!”

After double-checking my OP, I still have no idea how you could possibly derive this idea from what I said. 

I'm merely tempering down your absurd claim that Von Braun ""*stole everything*"" from Goddard, **because it's factually wrong**, and effectively ridiculous.

You're going ballistic over it for your own reasons, so please don't try to project this onto me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Robert Goddard invented the liquid fueled rocket. I’m sorry that that fact makes you angry, but I can’t change the facts.

You're the only one being angry here.

Since you like facts, here's one: Goddard only published his work on liquid-fuel rockets in [1936](https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/23837/SMC_95_Goddard_1936_3_1-11.pdf), ten years after his rocket flew. So nobody knew about it. 

And yet, by that time, many advanced designs of liquid-fuel rockets had already been independently worked on in the 20's and 30's in several countries. Including, obviously, Germany: industrial-grade liquid-fuel engines were already being tested in this country [as early as 1930](https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Srockhis.htm), and were powering sizeable rockets by 1932.

Whether you like it or not, liquid-fuel rockets have been imagined and tested independently from Goddard. Period. Tsiolkovsky himself had already conceptualised liquid-fuel rockets as early a 1903. So give me a break about the lone genius narrative.

&amp;nbsp;

Incidentally, it's rather peculiar how you've only quoted the part you were interested in from that Wikipedia article.

Here, let me fill the gap. This is literally one paragaph after yours:

&gt;*In response to Goddard's claims, von Braun said ""at no time in Germany did I or any of my associates ever see a Goddard patent"".* ***This was independently confirmed.*** *He wrote that claims about his lifting Goddard's work were the furthest from the truth, noting that Goddard's paper ""A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes"", which was studied by von Braun and Oberth, lacked the specificity of liquid-fuel experimentation with rockets.*

Well, well, would you look at that.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;He also invented thrust vectoring

Tsiolkovsky (again), Oberth (again) and others conceptualised thrust vectoring on their own, independently from Goddard, and European engineers followed suit to experiment practical concepts. Probably because thrust vectoring is inherently inseparable from rocketry in the first place.

For real, just stop trying to pin technological achievements on a single guy. I know it's intellectually comforting, but that's not how it works.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Your aggressively bigoted, anti-American (and uninformed) opinion

Again, you're the only one being aggressive and making it personal. Just because I'm contradicting you doesn't mean I'm after you. I give exactly zero fuck about where you come from, or who you are. I'm only addressing your statements.

You really ought to chill. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Your (...) opinion is not at all in line with any historians’ views on the subject

No, [it very much is](https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/robert-goddard-was-father-american-rocketry-did-he-have-much-impact-180969029/), actually.

Pretty much everybody acknowledges it. Even NASA.

&amp;nbsp;

My overall point is that there are no lone genius when it comes to science, engineering and progress. It's just a vast web of influences, borrowing, experimentations and iterations.

Yes, Goddard was brilliant and contributed to the advancement of rocket science. But so did dozens, hundreds, possibly thousands of other people around the world. They all collaborated together to push the limits of technology and science.

And that's precisely the idea you seem unable to contemplate: that Goddard wasn't the messiah of rocketry you want him to be, probably because you're under the impression that it somehow belittles him or the achievements of your country.

None but a sustainable EOR architecture would allow for long term exploration of the Moon instead of few weekend stints there but would take longer than 1969 so it was ruled out.

&gt;That was purely theoretical and up until Gagarin/Laika's flights there was a lot of debate on how cosmic radiation and constant exposure to zero-G conditions would affect live beings.

And because of that US also had testflights similar to what Russians did.

&gt;If you're referring to the apes and monkeys the US sent to space, some barely passed the Karman Line and never entered orbit until the Soviets did, and most went past only 50 miles anyhow. A lot of them perished as well.

Ballistic flight is enough to test both 0g impact and radiation that yo encounter at LEO.Also that reminds me of Sputnik being empty of detectors while Explorer has detected space radiation.

The GDL was somewhat seen as a natural successor to the Kievan Rus', the one state that didn't get subjugated by the Mongols.

I didn’t wrote what led to it. It took us ten years to chip enough power of off him to overthrow him successfully. It wasn’t wars that he started, but economy that got to him at the end. 

Equal share of success must be given to the opposition leaders who prepared and organized the ousting. Without controllers in the elections and  overwhelming campaign that was extremely dangerous at the time, none of it would have happened. People were tortured if police found that you had anything Otpor or DOS on you. Poster hanging was extreme sport then, but it happens that it is the same today.

There were a few generals, both police and military in the opposition, so they kept open channels of communication. 

I think the key was that we were sure that army is on our side, since police has been loyal to Milošević until last 48 hours, when there was already writing on the wall. We didn’t knew how would some of military generals react if Milošević gave the order, but we were pretty much sure that regular soldiers would outright refused the order. I think Belarusians should focus on this more. If our police knew that army was indifferent, they would crush us, since at that point it was heavily militarized. But with prospect of army joining the protestors, they knew the time has come. 

I think Belarusians should focus more on regular soldiers, as well as high ranking officers that are well respected in the army. They should bring the fight against their dictator in every village and town.

That's pretty simple to grasp your head around.

I also sincerely believe expectations of some great ruin among German exporters are overstated. German car manufacturers don't usually compete on price. Audi, BMW, Porsche, Mercedes - even VW - they never were the value option. So in order to keep selling to British customers they will simply take a hit in their margins and increase prices a bit. This will reduce sales, sure, but not by orders of magnitude. It's quite simply not to be expected that suddenly customers will chose an Acura or Lexus over a Porsche or Mercedes. They have more margin to work with than other car manufacturers.

If you look at British exports to the EU however - the picture is reversed. The UK manufactures and exports e.g. Nissans and Toyotas to the EU. Cars for customers that are interested in value for money. Will they accept 5-10% price increases? Doubtful. 

JLR will be in a tough spot, Jaguar never really could compete with the German premium manufacturers in the EU.

Because of its repeating military actions against it's neighbors. Against continued discrimination against minority groups within the country. Against a government that still doesn't acknowledge the genocidal past of its country. Against a regime that is increasingly anti-democratic.

You make it sounds as if I agree with those incursions. Don't get me wrong, the US is far more dangerous then Turkey can ever be. And I personally think that Europe should rid its ties with that increasingly unstable failed state.

Look I get it. You want Turkey to become closer towards Europe rather then farther. And I think if Turkey could reform into a more free and open democracy this would be a good idea too.

4766,"You're right in that I want Turkey to be closer to Europe, but if that means stopping all military operations? Heck no. See, it's easy to put all the countries that Turkey has ""attacked"" without any sort of context whatsoever, and then paint us as the bad guys. I understand that your average European may not have done a lot of research on the matters, but I have, and I know what's good for my country. Personally, I would expect all Turkish leaders, not just Erdogan, to be strict and harsh against terrorism, which is exactly what Turkey is doing. I thoroughly explained every single one of these incursions to someone else. I will quote.

&gt; 1974 invasion of Cyprus:

Turkey took military action in defense of Turkish Cypriots on the island of Cyprus, and also in order to stop a coup by the EOKA-B to reunite Cyprus with Greece, which would create a massive risk to the local Turks there who had already been victim of several crimes and massacres committed by nationalist Greeks.

Syria:

Turkey launched an offensive into northern Syria to remove the Kurdish YPG/YPJ forces from the Syrian-Turkish borders. The Syrian-Kurdish SDF has heavy connections to the PKK and Abdullah Öcalan, who are responsible for a 40 year guerrilla campaign against the Turkish state, and are also internationally recognized as terrorists. Several YPG/YPJ fighters were killed in northern Iraq fighting against Turkish soldiers, which is proof that the YPG/YPJ provides direct support to the PKK. Here are the ones that I've been able to find;

1). YPJ fighter Zozan Temir (code name Zozan Cudi), born in Qamishli, Syria. Killed on November 15, 2017 in Şırnak, Turkey by TuAF while fighting under the ranks of PKK/YJA-Star.

2). YPG fighter Ceylan Sido (code name Sorxwin Ağır), born in Ayn Al-Arab. Killed on February 24th 2017 in Bitlis, Turkey by Gendarme-SOF while fighting under the ranks of PKK/HPG.

3). YPG fighter Dara Huso (code name Gernas Cudi), borm in Al-Hasakah, Syria. Killed on November 24, 2018 in Şırnak, Uludere by Gendarme-SOF (Meteler) while fighting under the ranks of PKK/HPG.

4). YPJ fighter Zilan Sarık (code name Zilan Qamışlo), born in Qamishli, Syria. Killed on November 29, 2018 in Haftanın, Iraq by Turkish artillery fire while fighting under the ranks of PKK.

The reason Turkey needs to intervene is because the YPG/YPJ pose a massive risk to Turkey if they fully capture the border. Considering the fact that the YPG/YPJ has no problem sending fighters to the PKK to fight against Turks, who's to say that when stuff settles down, they won't launch their own guerilla campaign against Turkey, from Syria? This would be catastrophic for Turkey. Not to mention, one of the highest ranking members of the YPG/YPJ (that one guy that some politicians in the U.S tried to invite to the White House) is wanted by the Turkish state for the killing of several Turkish soldiers in the 90's, and is himself a former member of the PKK.

Iraq:

Turkey has been launching operations into Iraq literally ever since the beginning of the PKK conflict in 1984. The reason for this is, all of PKK's strongholds are in Iraq, and all of the PKK's attacks originate from there. I never thought I would have to sit here and explain to someone why Turkey is in Iraq, but hey, here we are.

Iraq is in no position to make demands to Turkey on what we can do and what we can't. For the past 40 years, Iraq has done exactly jack shit, and I can't blame them. The 2003 invasion of Iraq devastated the Iraqi state, and in 2020, they are not capable of fighting the PKK. So instead, Turkey cooperates with the Kurdistan Regional Government, who we've had close ties with for years. I don't want more of my people to die just because Iraq told us that we can't invade their land and take out the threat that so far killed close to 8,000 civilians.

Armenia/Libya

Turkey's Armenia policy is very similar to that of Libya. Azerbaijan is a fellow Turkic nation who has kept very close ties to Turkey, so it is our obligation to help them out when they are in need. Turkey has sent military advisors to Armenia to train Azerbaijani's, as well as supplied them with drones. The rumor that a Turkish F-16 shot down a Armenian fighters is entirely false and should not even be brought up here since there is not a single shred of evidence for it. Same for Libya - military advisors, drones, that's about it. As for the reason why we're there, we promised to help them out if they signed the EEZ deal. This is also a step to closer relations with the, mind you, legitimate government of Libya, while the rest of Europe is supporting a brutal illegitimate warlord.

I hope this clears up some misconceptions and blatant lies about Turkey. As a final note, I'd like to say that Turkey is claiming no land. They are only temporarily occupying it. There is also no sign of Turkey annexing any land. I don't understand why Turkey would need to annex some mud villages in some desert in Syria, or some rural mountains in Iraq.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/j5g4ga/turkeys_attacks_and_claims_on_its_neighbors/g7s7723/,ozan0053,1601901704

Also it has much more comfortable seats and better break control (not the sudden stop German version).

And most of the advanced electronics are what's gonna make the merc less reliable and more expensive to run, let alone the fact I prefer to drive myself, unmolested by stupid systems like lane control and distance keeping cruise control. If you need these systems you shouldn't be driving at all.

4883,"Turkey started post 1974 to dispute the status of Aegean islands, territory, waters, the whole lot. In 1976 tried to do seismic research in the Aegean after Greece found oil outside Thasos. This almost triggered war. The same issue was repeated in 1987 and it almost brought Bulgaria alongside Greece at war with Turkey. In 1995 a few months after UNCLOS came in effect that allows states to expand their territorial waters to 12nm, turkey against NATO articles that forbid one member state threatening the other with war, issued a Casus belli to Greece in case this right was put in effect.  What EU did was to reward this criminal behavior by awarding Turkey with a customs union. Next year, in 1996 Turkey invaded a Greek islet and yet again brought as in the verge of war that was defused with American intervention. The next years lacked the same Turkish aggression (although irredentism was still the same) because erdogan in his early years under the influence of Davutoglu, tried a softer approach. This ended around 2010 with the Mavi  Marmara flotilla crisis with Israel. Erdogan’s political Islam gradually came to terms and with and approached the usual Turkish nationalistic/militaristic/panturanic tendencies and the result was the current situation which once again brought us in the brink of war.

I chose 2010 because it was the first Credit Suisse report; it is also a good year to compare, since it is the last before the European Debt Crisis. I tried to put as neutral colors as possible. 

Please notice the following:

* This is about *wealth*, not income. How much people have, not how much people earn;
 
* The number increasing means that wealth is less evenly distributed; decreasing, that it is more evenly distributed.

* This does not tell anything about the *amount* of wealth: wealth inequality might have increased, but everyone might be better off, or decreased, but everyone might be worse off;

* This does not tell anything about current wealth inequality: for example, Finland is still a relatively equal country despite its growth of inequality in the last 10 years.

It’s a nonsensical argument, yes our energy needs grow. But it’s a free market, if someone else can create that energy for less Russia is out. Besides we have a EU energy market.

I brought the US into this because you parrot their arguments. Yes, ofc it makes us less objective. Just like US is less objective in regards to SA or Turkey. Also I don’t see the point of Germany not being allowed to buy the cheapest option for gas while the US happily transferred basically entire industries to China.

Lastly regarding nuclear, it was always only a minor part of Germany’s energy supply. Our plants were old and we have a really hard time with big infrastructure projects, we struggle building a airport for ffs. France does this better and are happy to sell us their excess energy.

Can you even formulate a scenario where our Russia gas dependency would be a issue energy wise? One that takes the whole picture of reserves, other sources, EU interconnection etc into account? 

Why btw does no one try to take the opposite view? Don’t you think it’s an issue for Russia to be so dependent on German money?

She claimed that as far as she knew some of the protesters who were hit with pepper spray were minors. Police also dispersed the demonstrators by carrying some of them to the sidewalk.""

According to the reports, the pepperspray decision was made by police supervisors, not by Bobby Selfrightousness there and then.

I don't know Finnish laws and how much the general public decided pepper spray would be inhumane in some way. Given the police officers carry it though, and police supervisors discussing its use I assume its standard repertoire. PS isn't any different from floodlights in your example imo (sleep deprivation is serious business too btw).

Thing is I don't get to make this decision, the policemen don't and you don't. The legislative does in any functional country. And declaring your cause as more important than the legislative like they did is counterproductive nonsense (unless you live in a country like the US where the legislative can be represented minority rule).

Are you a Fin living in the area and disagree? In that case you have quite the stake in it yes, and frustration if you disagree can be high. Does the majority in the area disagree? I am quite sure if the police's self-investigation doesn't change how these situations will be handled, a citizen demand to your local government will. No majority? Bad luck.

I live in Stuttgart, Germany and we had a minority protest demolition of the old train station. And I am happy with them having been pepper sprayed and water jetted, they wasted millions of taxpayers money, disrupted traffic many times and set up camp in the area bothering everyone. A clear minority. There was a quite severe accident with water jetting as a police officer hit a man's face with little distance and he lost an eye. That's sickening, how can a policeman operating that thing not be trained to not have that happen? Still I am supporting the use of both water jets and pepperspray.

Instead you wrote an article focusing an an active investigation. It takes time to collect all the evidence and put things together. Considering the fact that there is active war going on, details would be exposed when the time is right.

Your reasoning is completely wrong. Here is why. Su-25 was shot down in Vardenis which is a few miles away from the border and 20 miles away from Ganja Military Base. This is the base where Turkish F-16s were transported a week before (see their twitters for proof). F-16 doesn't need stealth. It is equipped with AIM-120 air-to-air missiles that have operational range of at least 40 miles. F-16 doesn't need to sneak anywhere.

I think it really depends on the country, here in Germany they have a completely different tradition than in the US (or the ""Anglo-Sphere"" in general).
Most of the modern fraternities, trace their history to patriotic clubs of students. One of the political goals of achieving a united Germany, which did not existed not so long ago, the new Germany also should have democratic features and fraternities were generally opposed of monarchies. 

Over the years the fraternities still remained quite political and they also grouped alliances etc.. So there are now many different political orientations common among them, though most are considered conservative by modern standards. 
They had quite an impact on German history, because they were one of the groups that pushed unification forward, especially the failed revolution of 1848 is associated with the fraternities. Today there influences is much lower, about 1% of all university students in Germany are a member of a fraternity.
This type of fraternity is also common in other countries, but not in all of Europe:

It was Erdogan making a coup on himself to justify a purge of the secular administrators, general etc in the military.

He did a dirty card on himself though all the capable guys in the military were seculars... so in case of war that’s pretty bad from start.

The thing is that will not stop his demise... we don’t need a coup to end this guy. 

Other than that a coup doesn’t happen like that army doesn’t go though crowd of people to make a coup. Take for example previous Turkish coups or even Enver Pashas coup against the Ottoman Sultan nobody goes around the city with tanks you go to the ruler and bang that’s it.

5508,"Possibly yeah, though they don't specifically require green parties. School Strikes in germany and protests have not been about getting the german green party into power, but getting the ruling coalition to take the problems more seriously, or indeed, punt the problem to a citizens assembly.

About the degrees, this is why they call themselves *extinction* rebellion, they're emphasising the mass extinctions caused by climate change, and the huge amounts of chaos and death that come from destabilised ecosystems, farming, population movements etc.

They don't yet have a metal band, but I think they could.

I think in germany the predominant effect was down to the school strikes, more than people like extinction rebellion. I think seeing desperation in the face of a child thinking about their future has more impact than seeing it in an old women risking arrest. There's still emotional resonance there, but we move to protect children far more quickly.

And thanks partly to that, germany is getting more green, even while all this stuff is happening; pre-corona and merkel's party's success dealing with it, they were loosing ground to the greens, and as part of winning support back they've got a bit more green themselves, pushing for a european green deal, which is probably happening any day now, if the budget at the EU level ever gets sorted out.

5561,"First of all, you can't really talk about them getting their rights denied since they could have easily held a legal protest without getting harmed. They were putting themselves at risk and others at risk and had to face the consequences. Pepper spray isn't lethal and the likelihood of someone dying or getting permanently damaged from pepper spray is low. If there were people with physical problems, they should have had common sense and stayed at home instead of partaking in illegal protests. Police were protecting them, they were on a road and blocking lots of people's lives. The fact that they didn't directly harm anyone doesn't mean that much, they were potentially putting so many people at risk by holding such a foolish protest. Would you call a man dying because his ambulance was being stopped by protesters an inconvenience? Not to mention that due to covid outbreaks this whole thing is even more dumb. Ambulance rides happen way more often and elderly people are very vulnerable to the virus. I bet that if you were amongst the inconvenienced drivers or people you wouldn't be so supportive of the protest. Not to mention that climate change protests change little to nothing today.

If they start using force to resist your use of force you escalate further, gradually and in proportion. The escalation has a ceiling though. For example no one should face permanent injury for something as comparatively trivial as a single route for traffic. Traffic can route around if the alternative is permanent disability.

5692,"This is not true. That territory was part of Bohemian Crown Lands (which Czechoslovakia succeeded legally) for centuries and Poland only claimed it after the disollution of Austria-Hungary. Keep in mind that according to Versailles Czechoslovak borders were specifically NOT based on language or national key, but instead using historical boundaries. You may not like that, and many Germans, Hungarians o Poles of the time would agree with you, but that doesn't change the fact that the territory you consider ""stolen"" legally contined to remain part of Czechoslovakia.

Despite that, Czechoslovakia was willing to negotiate. Both countries were agaisnt splitting the territory, but Poland wanted to resolve the dispute based on language (which would make it predominantly Polish, slightly over 50 %), whereas Czechoslovakia wanted to resolve it according to historical law, which meant that the dealings came to an impasse. In 1919, still during the negotiations, Poland decided to hold elections and draft soldiers in the parts that came under its provisional control, even thogh that was against the provisional agreements with Czechoslovakia, so this essentially concluded the negations and led to Czechoslovak military response. Entente eventually forced a ceasefire, but Poland refused any proposed solutions (plebiscite, arbitrage), so the territory was arbitrarily split based on strategic importance and language key regardless of Polish opinion.

I really hate to delve into this nationalist bullshit, but for some reason this misinformation gets repeated here or history related subreddits forever. It's pretty ridiculous that Czechoslovakia is being vilyfied here for trying to keep its legally owned land, albeit with Polish majority, while Poland was trying to restore multinational Commonwealth borders at the very same time.

Considering the words from the UK side lately (such as this topic where the UK is once again placing all the blame on the EU) I don't have that much faith it will come to an agreement. It seems Johnson is already trying to set things up in such a way that he can present himself as free from blame as possible if things don't work out. And then we will see if in the longer term one can be worked out, as normally these agreements indeed take a longer time, as seen with CETA and TTIP for example.

Can it go quicker? Sure. If you present a deal where the other party gets more benefits from it then you do, why wouldn't they agree on that. That is what happened with Japan.

When it comes to the general idea of wanting more climate change action I agree with the protestors, and it is obvious that a protest that does not somehow inconvenience people, for example by blocking traffic or otherwise forcing people and authorities to take notice, will mostly just get ignored.

However, I also don't see how any society could (unless there is massive support for them) allow for this sort of thing to go on for an unlimited time. Otherwise the traffic would be blocked frequently by all sorts of causes, some of them contradictory. So there must be some rule, and after a few hours of illegal protest, the police certainly is within its rights to start to break up a with minimum force a peaceful but law-breaking protest. 

But using pepper spray probably wasn't necessary, and if it gets used against non-violent protestors, its use will become normalized quite fast, and soon after the rules are pushed even further and you get a situation where police start randomly beating up people. 

So in a summary: I agree on vague terms with the protestors (without knowing more about the details, I've heard some of them have rather wacky ideas) and the need to do even illegal things to make a protest effective, I agree with the police breaking them up after a few hours if they're doing something illegal, but I don't agree with using any more force than absolutely necessary, and therefore I agree with there being an investigation into this.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/j4yfbm/finland_extinction_rebellion_protesters_get/g7p0e8s/,Aarros,1601829716

5805,"No, I've looked this up, their cause is to get government to create citizens assemblies to decide how to deal with climate change, getting statistically representative groups of citizens together in each country to discuss ways to get to zero carbon as soon as possible. They don't demand any specific solution, though individual members might like one or another.

They do have a demand about the scale of change required, which is basically about taking the 1.5 degree goal seriously, and the carbon budget associated with it, but also by getting people from countries that have historically used the most carbon budget to go to zero carbon first, in order to give maximum room for poorer countries with less history of emissions to also reach zero carbon without being locked in poverty.

Their focus on the carbon budget is not pseudoscientific, though it does exclude the possibility of overshooting, then compensating with negative carbon technologies. (They aren't alone in this, many people seeking practical solutions they know can be implemented don't want to rely on carbon capture, but it still influences the pace of change they demand)

All this put together means that they want western europe to move towards zero carbon within the next ten years, rather than the next thirty years as current plans are aiming.

This would need a big change of people's lives, which is why they want citizens assemblies, so that everyone can have a stake in finding a consensus solution to this problem.

My preference is different; I would prefer that we go for 100% zero carbon *electricity* by between 2025 and 2030, and continue its expansion to cover electric cars, and generally aim for a 14% reduction in net emissions, compounded, every year.

By having a decay function rather than a specific date and target, we can start with making the easiest changes now while also setting up the more difficult changes later, while still matching to the same [carbon budget](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html). The disadvantage of such a target is that because it is compounded, if the decline is missed in any given year, it can lead to going off target quickly. This would require us to make sure we also focus on negative emissions to take the slack, though again, this is technology which has not yet been scaled up.

14% annually is still a big ask, leading to a reduction of over 50% over five years, rather than 10 years as the EU currently plans, and with only about 21% of current emissions by 2030. But if we plan to half our emissions every 4-5 years, with each parliament understanding it is their responsibility to build on what their predecessors did by the end of their term.",,/r/europe/comments/j4yfbm/finland_extinction_rebellion_protesters_get/g7olwg3/,eliminating_coasts,1601821872

How are you sure about that? its not something that has been tried for this issue before.

&gt;Most people want to do dome thing but can't/are too lazy

maybe it inspires them to see how far others are willing to put themselves in danger. maybe that inspires them to do something themselves. 

&gt;How about spending all that energy and time on coming up with ideas that are easy to join/support

i already told you, that is what people have been trying for more than 50 years and it isn't really working. also why not do both? 

&gt;Or, fancy that, legal protest, if its only about being heard.

you're heard better if you do extreme stuff. think of people lighting themselves on fire out of protest for example. taking personal risk such as being pepper sprayed for a cause can inspire people, or make them doubt whether maybe there isn't something to what is being preached.

&gt;You're not among soooo many sheep and nobody acknowledges climate change is a big issue here, so again what's the point.

nobody said so, stop making strawmen. the point is that there isn't being done enough to divert the worst of climate change.

&gt;Government and corporate hands need to be forced, the general public needs more means to help in their limited capabilities.

well, hows that been going the past 50 years? the public elects the government, and the public isn't electing the right governments appearantly. in the end its just society as a whole that is failing this issue. thats why these people are trying to derail parts of society, to signal how bad the issues are getting and how far they are willing to sacrifice themselves for it.

5889,"&gt;So both good and bad services exist, shocker. 

So in your opinion steam is a game that is moetized in the games-as-service manner?  
And that starwars battlefront 2 is a digital store front?

Maybe its hard for you to differentiate, but digital distribution of games is not exactly the same thing as monetizing individual games by offering them as games-as-service.

Digital storefronts are popular due to ease of use, and due to not hindering user experience.

The exact opposite is true about games-as-service.  
Which is contraversial enough that it might lead to regulating the wild west of video game production comapnies. That so far managed to dodge having to oblige to any kind of regulation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I didn't say anything about tesla, the thread started with tesla, but that was someone else making some other point. Whether it's tesla, ford, uber or robotaxi inc offering this kind of service doesn't matter. The types of cars don't matter ( other than having autopilot functionality ). 

Autopilot (exculding the name) is not unike to tesla.  
My father recently bought a hunday kona EV, which features lvl5 autonomous driving (out of the 6 lvls possible).  
Its perfectly capable of going with the traffic on the highway, hands off.  
Sadly(?) if you don't bugger the driving wheel it will start reminding you to do it pretty loudly and obnoxiously.

Self driving technology i VERY far from being unique to tesla.  
Despite what the company promo material will tell you. For that matter there are companies like AImotive who works solely on creating self driving mechanism, including plans to make units that can be retrofitted to cars.

Tesla is unique in two things, Elon Musks cult following, and its extraordinary share prices.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Owning your own car, leasing, renting, using uber and/or taxis are always going to be alternatives. That isn't going away. ( unless these services lose out on business due to competition ) If a service that gives you most of the benefits with less of the hassle comes up, I really don't see why you wouldn't use it when it provides value. And if it doesn't provide value it won't happen. It's as simple as that. 

Maybe it seems strange.  
However plenty of companies have goneto bankruptcy (or close to it) due to visionary leadership forcing their vision through in spite of market realities, or due to predatory monetization alienating their customer base.

(I would say the latter play significantly into the decline of apple products - as they came to be seen as an overpriced accessory item used to show off wealth by people who have more money than sense)

To put it bluntly as soon as tesla starts producing robotaxi, its shareholders will make it use all of its production capactiy on the robotaxi project.  
After all if everythong goes accoridng to the best case scenario it gives the company its chance to drive all other car manufacturers out of hte market and achieve monopoly. For shareholders, that is worth risking losing their share.  
And ofc.  
With such prospects, its very enticing to utilize ome very predatory monetization modells. After all that offers the most profit.  
And since you are bound to be in monopoly position, there will be no alternative to pick.",,/r/europe/comments/j3qncv/norway_816_of_new_car_registrations_in_september/g7onxnf/,Xicadarksoul,1601823017

5932,"&gt;Lolberts in developed countries like Germany or even the US will concede that other economic systems will not bring total ruin, but will still maintain that there is room for optimisation. But none of this black-and-white crap that you get from lolberts in places like Argentina, Albania etc. 

Every economy is a mixed economy, except Best Korea. There really are no 'alternative systems' being proposed.

I think their wish for the cargo cultism of capitalism comes from the fact that there isnt very much wealth to distribyte in those countries. Like imagine how good a 9-5 office job is to a lithium miner, or a mining job to someone begging on the street. Economic growth is the only large scale solution, something new has to be created. There are tons of examples of poor countries going massive welfare states and collapsing, Zimbabwe being the most amusing one to say the least. Government distrust from prior experiences can be a huge factor.

&gt;No, it's not socialism, but it's definitely not a very capitalistic society. It's social-democracy, with heavy state involvement.

If we take Sweden as an example, they have very market oriented welfare, people are free to choose which private companies they will use, and the state pays them. Their markets are very free and its one of the easiest places to do business, despite the taxes. Not many regulations. If anything youd want to take Frances economy as an example of more socialistish less capitalistish country. Although their economy is pretty inefficient, doing business there is atrocious, walls of regulations.

&gt;We also forget that while the Scandinavia is more soc-dem now and less socialist, during the 1930-1970 development phase they were extremely socialist. Yet that did not prevent them from getting rich. The argument from lolberts is that socialism always leads to ruin. Evidently did not for the Scandis. This is the kind of ideological blinkers I referred to

Yes, and since the 70s the economy developed much more slowly than their other counterparts, in the 90s the whole shit show collapsed and they started liberalizing. Since then living standarts have been improving much faster.

&gt;I am also unpersuaded that a return to a more socialist model would harm them. What has happened since the 1980s is merely that neoliberalism came into vogue because rich elites pushed for it.

Well the in the current academic debate this claim is not widely supported, maybe you can provide a source to back up your opinion.

&gt;Taxation is a second-order issue at best. You can have low taxes but still be a deeply corrupt society with tons of oligarchs taking huge extractive rents (classic example is Russia). You can also have high taxes but where the majority of the corruption happens in the state, because that is where the rent-seeking opportunities will be in such a system.

The main income from the Russian state is from energy exports, private and public sector. There is no reason for them to tax the populance as that would constitute mear pennies. Such a model is not replicable in every country around the globe and has nothing to do with institutuons, rather geography.

But i agree that taxation isnt as important as other aspects, like efficiency of markets or public sector.",,/r/europe/comments/j4b1mq/kalinin_prospekt_moscow_ussr_1977/g7o7uni/,The1ronCurtain,1601815034
