61,"The right wing is evil because the left wing is stupid. And the more stupid the left is, the more evil the right is as well. That's not fair of course but it makes a lot of sense, the opposite on the other hand makes no sense at all, the more evil the right is, the more the left feels no responsibility to try to understand its enemy. Being evil is of course morally bankrupt, but they know exactly what they're doing and they understand the left wing perfectly and know exactly where to hit them, and of course also understand the context and environment, albeit never care about it except from a selfish point of view. The left wing on the other hand doesn't understand shit and just complains about everything and uses ethics as a justification for everything. 

Consider two people, a bully and a victim, the bully provokes the victim and eventually hits them. With a bloody nose the victim says that it's not fair and he's innocent and shouldn't have to fight to defend himself because he's innocent. That bloody nose is a badge of honor for the victim because it validates his strategy of never doing a damn thing, it justifies his cowardice, he feels like a martyr. And they're the perfect couple, a symbiotic codependent relationship, the bully needs a victim and the coward needs a way to justify his weakness. 

But the left didn't use to be like this, it used to be about the rights and needs of poor people, ie getting shit done for them and in their interest. It changed when the left became a synonym for the oppressed and then it attracted all the weak people who needed to justify playing the victim. It wasn't about getting shit done anymore, it was about complaining. So that's when the poor people who still needed to get their shit done changed and started to vote the right. Because the right might be evil and morally bankrupt, but their purpose and strategy is always winning, ie getting shit done no matter what, albeit selfishly of course. 

So it's not about opposing the left for no reason, it's because since the right is evil, the more self-righteous someone is the more they signal themselves as a target. ""Hit me because I won't fight I'll just complain and I'll love it because it gives me the perfect justification to complain some more and play the victim"". You can see this perfectly in US politics now, the more outrageous Trump is the more the left is complaining and moving the goalpost of their red lines.

64,"You really shouldn't engage in apologia for Castro, Ho, or Tito. None of them were great guys:

&gt; I mean Castro killed a few hundred people

[According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba#Revolution_and_Communist_party_rule_(1959%E2%80%93present):

""From 1959 to 1966 Cuban insurgents fought a six-year rebellion in the Escambray Mountains against the Castro government. The government's vastly superior numbers eventually crushed the insurgency. The rebellion lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the Cuban Revolution.The U.S. State Department has estimated that 3,200 people were executed from 1959 to 1962. According to Amnesty International, official death sentences from 1959–87 numbered 237 of which all but 21 were actually carried out. Other estimates for the total number of political executions range from 4,000 to 33,000.The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 revolution were policemen, politicians, and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the Cuban population.""

So people aren't certain, but the number was almost certainly greater than ""a few hundred"". Such numbers also don't include deaths during the [Escambray Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escambray_rebellion), where Castro's forces executed most POWs they captured. It was definitely more than a ""few hundred people"", though- that number only comes from official Cuban documents, which are both incomplete and whitewashed.

&gt; Tito and Ho Chi Minh were also relatively less bloody.

Ho Chi Minh was extremely bloody and violent. [At least 13,500 people (and likely many, many more) were executed during North Vietnam's 1950's land reform program.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War#Transition_period) Not exactly a man of peace.

While Tito was comparatively less bloodthirsty than most other famous communists, and has no particular infamous mass killings to his name, he was still a rigid authoritarian. Titoist Yugoslavia may not have been massacring people *en masse*, but it was still a brutal police state with very little tolerance for any kind of dissent.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/a01ef8/champsélysées_paris_this_afternoon_2411/eaeuzfl/,jogarz,1543123425

Indeed, you'll find we have similar debates over internal tax havens, e.g. Delaware, where companies like Google, despite being almost entirely based in California, register in Delaware to escape corporate taxation.

Anyway, I'll point out, one of the biggest points of weakness of the EU is having joint monetary policy without joint fiscal policy. You get situations like Greece, where the country lacks the requisite control over monetary policy to temper a recession, and the rest of the EU just shrugs and goes ""figure it out"" without acknowledging that the currency union basically makes it impossible for such countries to ""figure it out"" on their own.

Again though, the major point is that the GDP of states is very much comparable to the GDP of EU countries. A country in the EU exiting the EU will take a comparable hit to its GDP to a US state peacefully seceding from the US. Now, the fact that a US state seceding from the US would trigger a war and thus lower GDP is its own issue, but from an *analytical standpoint* the regions are comparable.

This is something that seems obvious to French but isn't to non-French, I can't understand why. Anyway, I tried to explain this on another post so a little copy and paste :

&gt; His entire campaign was ""I'm not from the left, I'm not from the right, I'm not from the center, I'm above this ""old politics"" !"", turns out he's applying the ideas of the right and having more and more situations that look a lot like ""old politics"". Basically, he made a lot of people believed he was different, he isn't, people are realizing it. He also started his mandate looking like a wannabe-king, which is different from the ""normal president"" Hollande, but looked not that different from the ""bling bling president"" Sarkozy. Right now it's getting even worse, as is big idea to prove that he's different was to have people in the government who aren't politicians (Nicolas Hulot, TV star as minister of the environment, Laura Flessel, olympic gold medal winner as minister of sport and Stéphane Bern, TV star, with a mission to save old buildings), but Hulot tapped out because he had no power, Flessel tapped out because she's suspected to have forgotten to pay some taxes and Bern just said that he's going to tape out because he doesn't have any money to do what he's supposed to do. It's like the big painting job that was done on this party to make it look new and different is slowly going away and people are pissed at him because of how big the lie seem to have been.

159,"The Russian Empire acquired the Baltic areas as autonomous Duchies administered by Baltic German nobility via the Treaty of Nystad in 1721 and Courland in 1795.[1] In 1914, World War I broke out and by 1915 German armies had occupied Lithuania and Courland incorporating the areas into Ober Ost.[2] As the Russian Empire began to collapse, independence movements sprung up on many regions. After the 1917 October Revolution in Russia, Baltic political leaders attempted to establish the independent states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; however, German control continued throughout the area until early 1918. Later in 1918, the area was drawn into the Russian Civil War and proclamations of independence were issued in Lithuania on 16 February, in Estonia on 24 February and in Latvia on 18 November 1918.[3]

Between years of 1918–1920, the bolsheviks tried to establish Soviet republics in the Baltic area. In November 1918 the Red Army conquered Narva. They proclaimed the Commune of the Working People of Estonia, but it was able to function only for six weeks.[4] In December, the Latvian communists controlled Riga and proclaimed the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic. In May 1919, the communist control ended when the city was taken by combined German, Latvian and White Russian troops.[5]

By 1920, German troops had withdrawn and the Russian Civil War was in its final phase. Consequently, the Baltic states signed peace treaties with Soviet Russia. Estonia signed the Treaty of Tartu on 2 February, Lithuania signed the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty on 12 July and Latvia signed the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty on 15 August 1920.[3] In 1920, all three Baltic states adopted constitutions including universal suffrage, a multi-party system and parliamentary with a president. However, the communists were prohibited from participation in politics.[5]

165,"Yeah, the issue in communication is that there wasn't a single tribe. It was the first feast with that particular tribe. 

Maybe you realize this maybe you don't but one thing I see people from Europe get wrong is they view the Native Americans as one amorphous tribe. 

It's not the Natives, it's the Iroquois, Sioux, Lakota etc. Each of which was distinctive in their own right. 

&gt;It was as you said, Ribbing for someone trying to explain away the treatment by saying ""but this time it was about the one time we werent cunts"".

As I've said though while that may have been the original intent or purpose it has since then been warped over the last two centuries.  

I guess my line of thought on the matter is that while it's horrible what happened to the Native Americans they're kind of a silent minority in this day and age. The mainly want to be left alone or to escape their reservations and seek opportunity.

 They make up about 2% of our population and I can honestly say I've maybe only seen 2 full-blooded Native Americans in my lifetime (They're only in about 21 of our 50 states)

I'm not saying that it's right but anytime you have an overwhelming majority the culture is going to reflect that. People are going to make artificial distinctions wherever you go.

In the US it's Black versus White, In Asia, the lighter skinned Asians don't like the darker skinned Asians, Hutus vs Tutsi, Hindu vs Muslim. 

I would say that for the US at least we've gotten a lot better about how we treat others but racism is always going to exist in some capacity. We can strive forward and attempt to make things better but people naturally associate themselves with groups because it gives their lives meaning. 

It's called the paradox of tolerance. Being all inclusive means giving everyone an opportunity to bring forth ideologies that you may personally feel threatened by or not agree with. 

So do we just give every idea credence like genocide? I hope not. Society will stifle ideas and concepts that they perceive to have value and try to quash any they don't.

166,"The protest is not really faring so much. The recent events are just the action of most virulent protesters. It remains to be seen whether the protests die or simmer to become something else.

Note that Macron was elected because he faced a right-wing nationalist which allowed him to rally votes from extreme-left to the moderate right wing electorate. He was the lesser worst choice for many. So he really never had a strong support from the majority of French people.

To make it simple, the raise of gasoline taxes is the stroke that broke the camel's back for some. There is a growing feeling that Macron and its government do not understand the average French citizen. Macron keeps criticizing the French people as reluctant to change, lazzy, pessimitic while each day many see themselves struggling to keep their jobs or get new ones out of big city areas ( while industries and services got also transferred to Eastern european countries or to North Africa ).

Anyway, many feel that everything is grim enough that it doesn't require more taxes which affect the average working classes and not really the elites or trade markets.

186,"I’m saying that the legal market was so small as to make it irrelevant wether it was involved in an incident.

Considering that Slovakia Northern Ireland New Zealand the Czech Republic and Norway haven’t had school shootings since the same time I think we can safely rule out the ludicrous idea that a handgun ban would reduce the chance of a school shooting or gun violence in general. 

The illegal market has remained at least the same size in most of the UK with it likely getting bigger in London but smaller in Manchester since the 90’s in any case it’s roughly the same size everywhere with the exception of the place where it was biggest in the first place.

In short the handgun ban was useless on account of the fact that the illegal handguns in the uk never came from legal sources legal handguns were very rarely used in crimes and handguns have remained the weapon of choice for criminals. There have also been no school shootings in the 60 years before the handgun ban where semi auto pistols were available but little more regulated than say a rifle. Also to note there seems to be a notable mass shooting in the mainland UK every 10-15 years since the 80’s hunger Ford was in 87 the school dunblane I believe was in 96 or 97 I can’t remember and the last one Cumbria I believe was 2013 or 2012 I can’t remember these dates exactly ",,/r/europe/comments/9zq7ug/school_shootings_in_europe_since_2010_but_it_is/eaemxx4/,quentin-the-jew1,1543115480

Curriculum depends on the course, but all around it's seen as a quite prestigious, high-quality institution. 

They have dual accreditation in the US and Hungary, which is how they can attract students from over 100 countries of the world, but it's also the reason/excuse the government is in a row with them. They first said having a US accreditation is an unfair advantage if they don't actually have a program ongoing in the US. They've set up a joint programme with Bard College in New York, now they (govt) are saying that's not fulfilling their requirements they've made. 

They are also intentionally prolonging this ordeal (and the threat of revoking their operational permit) by setting unnecessarily long deadlines and refusing to examine the developments before those pass - in a probable attempt to drive them out. In the above situation, CEU has produced the programme agreement demanded of them in a matter of months for which the government gave them a year to do so and then extended it again. Now the deadline is Jan 2019 and the educational authority said they will only start the examination of facts after that.

The BBC's posted a few pieces arguing the matter, which would run contrary to the whole thing being covered up by the current British government - as opposed to Moscow's stance on the Holodomor.

&amp;#x200B;

Though if you're whole argument is that Capitalism is no better than Communism in its atrocities, in this particular case I believe those who believe in these events argue that they were a product of Stalinism, and his own agenda. 

Which is to say that given later revisionism within Soviet Communism, and the acceptance that Stalin was a monster, arguing against the intent behind such events - as an attack on Communism - is failing to acknowledge that Stalin was in fact a monster, and he countermanded the Russian Revolution for his own personal gains. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm totally lost on those who are defending Stalin and his crimes against humanity, though yes, to an extent later Soviet and Russian governments would tone back their decrying of these events. Still, given all the other mass murder going on at the time within the Soviet Union, regardless of these so called ""Nazi propaganda"" sources that are available on these events, there is enough correlation that the Communists could have perpetrated a form of genocide in Ukraine.

This topic is totally divisive.

First, the users here seem to be overwhelmingly EU-federalists.

Second, it would not have been like that if there is trust that Germany will also give up its sovereignty to the greater good, but previous German initiatives like Nord Stream 2, Link Tax, Upload Filters -- all of them pretty much forced on EU by Germany -- cast doubt on how it is in reality. If one's dream is United States of Europe but this dream is hijacked and sidetracked to some version of Greater Germany, this is *bound* to backfire.

They cry over disappearing smaller train stations and train lines, yet they are the ones who caused them to shut down because they’re better off alone in their car. They’re fed up with taxes, but they want free or cheap healthcare and to keep local hospitals open and up to date.  They want to go back to the good old times they fantasise about (even though the purchase power was lower). They want local factories to be open yet they are not ready to pay the price of local labour. They want changes only if others change and not them, and they don’t vote.

585,"&gt;Kosovo police sources told BIRN that Milan Radoicic, a businessman widely seen as the real power-holder in Serb-majority northern Kosovo, is a suspect in the murder of Kosovo Serb politician Oliver Ivanovic.

&gt;Ivanovic, who was shot in front of his party headquarters in Mitrovica on January 16, named Radoicic as a key figure in what he alleged was an intimidatory system of power in northern Kosovo. Radoicic has not commented on the allegation.

&gt;In June, Radoicic was named vice-president of Srpska Lista, the main Kosovo Serb party, which is backed by Belgrade.

This could potentially blow the lid on everything Ivanovic was fighting for, that north Kosovo is controlled by mafia with ties to Serbia's government. Potentially the whole Serbian list could be tied with this and guilty of murder of political opponents and again it goes right back to Belgrade.

&gt;Based on my sliming of hdi index numbers, there wasn't at all an out of norm change in hdi for poland from 1990 to 2017.

There were many severe changes in HDI methodology between 1990 and 2017. Comparison of HDI numbers between the different years is an unreliable method of measurement.

Meanwhile, there was an absolutely outstanding [GDP growth](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/images/graphs/gdp.png) in that time period.

&gt; Guess facts aren't convenient though :&gt;).

Can't hear you over the sound of the real wages of the Polish people increasing 20-fold in that period, and the shops actually having something in them besides the empty shelves.

Unless they wish to remain on the opposition backbenches for all eternity. So singing from the hymn sheet of ""the European mantra"" is kind of a requirement career-wise. So Merkel, being the polit-animal that she is, can play the role of theeuropean integrationist without any risks as the circumstances and compromises needed to make such ideas reality just aren't there and won't be there for the forseeable future.

This point interests me the most. I completely agree she is a very skilled politician, but is this caused because Germans (in general) want this (further federalization), or is it tied more closely to her parties base or something else?

648,"I don't think we have exact data on what percentage of Slovenians voted for Yugoslavia and what percentage for Austria, however I think it is very likely that the majority of Slovenians voted for leaving Austria.

Altogether 37 303 people voted in the Carinthian plebiscite, 15 278 voted to join Yugoslavia and 22 025 to remain part of Austria. I think it is fair to assume that all of the votes for Yugoslavia came from Slovenes and votes for Austria were divided between Slovenians and Austrians.

According to the 1910 census we can estimate that approximately 70% percent of the people who participated in the plebiscite, were Slovene speakers. So if we take the number of all the people who participated as voters in the plebiscite (37 303) and multiply it with 0.7 to get 70%, we get 26 112 people.

Considering that it is very likely that all votes for Yugoslavia came from Slovenes, we can subtract 15 278 from 26 112 and we get 10 834, which can be considered the number of Slovenes that voted to remain part of Austria. Assuming based on this numbers, we can see that the majority of Slovenes in fact did vote to join Yugoslavia, however a considerable minority voted to remain part of Austria.

Considering that the Slovene national consciousness was strong in that area, this means that many nationally conscious Slovenes voted to remain part of Austria. Partially they probably voted that way, because they were promised they would not be discriminated against in new Austria and that Slovene language would have the same status as German language in their area.

Like you said it was very unfortunate how Slovenian minority ended up being treated in Austria after the plebiscite was over, when all those promises seemed to be forgotten.",Slovenia,/r/europe/comments/9zwihl/the_serbian_cavalry_reached_this_point_and_not/ead9ohy/,Naju55,1543077149

It's  idfferent from usual protest in the way that it's mostly people you  never hear about, workers who despite their job can barely make it at  the end of the month. One the key element is the inequalities between  territories in France. The ""Yellow vest"" are people from small town and  villages or suburbs towns around the big metropolitan aeras, and those  territories have been forsaken for a long time now, and especially under  Macron presidency. Big urban aeras are favored, rents are skyrocketing  in big cities, casting out the middle classes in the suburbs. Meanwhile  the countryside is completely forsaken, public services are closing,  some small towns city centers looks like shadow cities, while there is  an absurd concentration of wealth and services in big cities centers.  Honestly, in big cities, sometimes it seems like your going to a  completely different country just by crossing a bridge from the downtown  to the rest of the city.

Most  of those people are already in the red when they get their salary, and  most of them have to make 1-2 hours of cars everyday to go to work,  hence the cristallisation around the fuel taxes, even tho it's more the  trigger than the real main reason. It's simply about growing  inquealities, over-centralisation, both in favor of Paris, and in every  region in favor of urban centers, while the rest of the country is  suffering and is more and more despise by all this urban population  looking down at them as if they where peasants or ""rednecks"". You can  reasily see that on the comments on social medias, inculding reddit,  mostly used by (very) young urbans who seems to love making fun of those  people in a quite childish and despicable way.

Those  people work hard for the most part, and they have suffer in silence for  a very long time, but now they can take it anymore. The suppression of  the taxes for they very rich, the massive fixal evcasion (100 billions  in france), the skyrocketing salaries of major compagnies bosses  etc....all of this while taxes for the middle classes have been raising  without htem seeing the benefits of it have been too much for them. Plus  the general content Macron is showing, and all his fancy ""start-up  nation"" speeches. Those people wants to remind him that France isn't  just a giant start-up full of fancy tech workers drinking starbucks and  driving their electric cars.

It's  also very meaningfulbecause of the massive support of the population.  Last polls shows that 80% of the people are supporting them and agreed  with their anger.",Alsace (France),/r/europe/comments/9zxi31/police_fire_tear_gas_at_paris_protesters/eaczutt/,gromfe,1543069536

Since EU law is treaty based a law is nearly impossible to remove since every nation has to agree to change it. If one nation says no then the law stands as is.

784,"The antivaxxer comment was just to show how absolutely absurd your reasoning was. 

How is outsourcing jobs that America does not need worse for the country? 

America is a post industrial country, just like most of the European countries you seem to love, and has shifted towards the service industry rather than manufacturing. The service industry (this includes software development and other modern day sectors) provides more GDP per capita and higher average wages than manufacturing. Simply put, America outgrew manufacturing it's own products. 

To learn why you have to learn about 2 factors of production, capital (physical stuff/technology) and labor. Manufacturing of most things that we use everyday is more labor intensive. The US has better education than the countries we now outsource manufacturing to, but those jobs don't require any less education in those poor countries. A high school level of education would now be wasted placing components into an iPhone. So we as a nation moved on. 

The service industry is less labor intensive but extremely capital intensive. Banks have to spend a ton of money every year on technological infrastructure to stay relevant, but they don't need 30 people at every branch location anymore because computers do a lot of work. 

You can't outsource some things though. You can't outsource car manufacturing yet, and you'll never be able to outsource things related to national defense unless the country is heavily vetted. 


Edit: to clarify, I mean America as a whole is better off from outsourcing manufacturing.

802,"&gt; What do you mean by that specifically?

When anarchists (I'm using this term from now on for libertarian socialists/communists for shorthand) say ""abolish the government"", it's technically ""abolish the [bourgeois] government"", as they do not recognise liberal democracies of the status quo to be actual legitimate governments as they are not by the people nor for the people. They are ultimately tools for the capitalist system. 

Our current society is structured vertically. It's tiny dictatorships everywhere. The anarchist solution to organise society is to organise it horizontally (I'm being **very simple** here and leaving out a lot of what anarchism is), that is: decision making structures (this applies to government, workplaces, families, communities, etc) should be organised horizontally rather than vertically so that no one has dominance over another (there are such things as ""justified hierarchies"", but that's a longer topic).

&gt; re-write the human brain


Ah human nature. Human nature is to be organised vertically, to have a state in society, whatever. That is, of course, only true if you believe that is human nature--that humans even have an innate nature. I mean, it's reasonable to look around you and conclude that humans want to dominate other humans. There's currently multiple genocides going on right now around the world. But by that same logic, if one were to look inside a coal mine and nothing else, one might assume it is human nature to cough.

Of course, people have a sense of self interest (or selfishness if you wish to call it that). Marx, Kropotkin, Bakunin, Engels, etc, didn't ""forget"" about human nature, as much as it is a meme today to say so. Everyone also a sense of selflessness and generosity too, so you win some you lose some. I don't think you'd withhold food from a starving neighbour without payment, would you? I mean, if capitalism is supposed to ""support"" our ""selfish human nature"" then the very existence of those that spend their lives in soup kitchens, donate to charity, help their neighbours, etc etc, all defy the logical conclusion of that assumption.

As I said before with the coughing nature, I believe it is capitalism itself that even allows us to think that human nature could possibly be innately selfish, or predominately so. Traditional societies have always been egalitarian gift-based societies. It wasn't until the advent of currency and the later advent of capitalism that this has changed.

There are brilliant interviews done by light Lithuanian dissidents - such as just people reading banned newspapers of church-going youth. You have no clue what kind of injustice they went through, and you never will.

Why do I get criticised for not knowing what to call what when I probably know about the life in the Soviet Union than 99% of the thread? I've done my reading. I've listened to my parents. I've studied about what kind of ideology was presented in the USSR and how it was being implemented, how the post-Stalin ideological implementation differed from the Stalin one. The immense pressure that the-really-smart-people had to deal with in universities and  afterwards.

The reason why you have no clue about what was ideologically happening in the USSR is because everything they made in the humanities (""scientific communism"" articles and so on) are pure ideology that all was rendered useless the day the USSR fell. Think about how many great thinkers we know in the social sciences from the cold war - Karl Raimund Popper, Alasdair MacIntyre and dozens of others. In the Soviet Union? Zero. Some were even defending their PhDs with dissertations such as ""Communist youth's role in the October Revolution"". People were spending years writing such impossible nonsense (because the communist  youth did not even exist and the Octover Revolution didn't even happen).

* it makes common economic policies with each electoral term, kinda like x-year plans of the Soviets.

US can't fix Flint lead water for god knows how long and they are democracy.

&gt;He wouldn't be able to do that in a tsarist Russia even.

Russian Empire wasn't better than British Empire and British Empire allowed people in India and Ireland to starve.

&gt;In tsarist Russia when the government wanted to repress you, you ended in the katorga 'workflow', which was a light (in scale of the repressions as well as in the numbers) version of the later gulag system.

That's not true.

&gt;On November 17, 1891 the government asked the people to form voluntary anti-famine organizations.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1891%E2%80%9392#cite_note-2) [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy), the most famous volunteer,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1891%E2%80%9392#cite_note-3) blamed the [Tsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar) and the [Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Church) for the famine. As a result of this, **the Orthodox Church excommunicated Tolstoy and forbade citizens from accepting help from his relief organization**.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1891%E2%80%9392#cite_note-4) The future Tsar [Nicholas II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II) headed the relief committee and was a member of the finance committee three months later, while the Tsar and [Tsarina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsarina) raised 5 and 12 million rubles respectively. [Alexander III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Russia)'s sister-in-law [Grand Duchess Elizabeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Elisabeth_of_Hesse_and_by_Rhine_(1864%E2%80%931918)) also raised money by selling peasant crafts in [bazaars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar). Nicholas II said, ""A great honor, but little satisfaction ...I must admit I never even suspected its \[finance committee's\] existence"".[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1891%E2%80%9392#cite_note-5) The [zemstvos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zemstvo) got 150 million roubles from the government to buy food, but **were only allowed to lend to peasants who could repay them and were therefore the least needy**. **Starving peasants had to eat raw donated flour and ""famine bread"", a mixture of** [**moss**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss)**,** [**goosefoot**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosefoot)**,** [**bark**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_(botany)) **and husks**. In February 1892, the government bought 30,000 [Kyrgyz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan) horses so the fields could be plowed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The main reason the blame fell on the government was that **grain exports were not banned until mid-August** and merchants had a month's warning so they could quickly export their reserves. **Minister of Finance** [**Ivan Vyshnegradsky**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Vyshnegradsky) **even opposed this late ban**.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1891%E2%80%9392#cite_note-A_People's_Tragedy,_page_158-1) He was seen as the main cause of the disaster as it was his policy to raise consumer taxes to force peasants to sell more grain.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1891%E2%80%9392#cite_note-A_People's_Tragedy,_page_158-1) Even Russia's capitalists realized the industrialization drive had been too hard on the peasants.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] **The government also contributed to the famine indirectly by conscripting peasant sons, sending taxmen to seize livestock when grain ran out, and implementing a system of redemption payments as compensation to landlords who had lost their serfs.**

But Germany has already run into excessive diminishing returns. Energiewende is a huge failure in cutting CO2 emission. If they instead elected to invest into nuclear they could have built respectable fleet of new nuclear reactors and cut commissions substantially. It is not a speculation. There is a historical precedence for this. France is producing like 70% of its electricity with nuclear power and they haven't run into any diminishing returns to speak of. It is proven to work.

If you want to bitch about imperialism, I won't stop you.

I'm not an apologist. I'm an unashamed capitalist.

&gt;Capitalism has its start in de facto state-empowered trading companies

That was imperialism, which was practiced by *everyone that could*.

&gt;The attrocities of the Dutch India Company and British India Company in scale of how many participated probably outweigh both the Fascist and Commies and Imperialist together.

""How many participated"" is a retarded metric. It's also probably wrong, because communism came later, and populations increase.

1000,"It's not necessarily about not caring. Many elderly just live far away from their living family making it impossible to take care of them all the time. The urbanization started quite late in here, before the war we were pretty much a poor developing agrarian society.

The biggest movement towards cities started only after the war, and small more remote areas have a lot less people than there has been historically, as the young generations have mostly left to cities after better opportunities.

As a personal anecdote, my grandparents from my father's side lived their adult lives quite near us in Espoo, next to Helsinki, where my grandpa had been relocated when he had to leave as a refugee when we lost the part of the country where his family farm had been before the war. After they retired around 1990, grandma wanted to move back north to the small town she was born in and still had her sister and old childhood friends there.

The rest of their family and the younger generations were at least 5 hours away, we were over 8 hours away. So eventually, when her sister and her husband died and grandpa died, grandma was alone in there, with a few friends still alive, of course, and we could just visit them whenever we had vacations. When she became worse, we pretty much had to trust the local healthcare and social services to take care of the day to day care and try to oversee that from the other end of the country. Luckily her town had excellent people doing great work in that sector, and she got taken care of well, both before and after she had to move to an assisted living facility and eventually to a hospital. 

I can imagine there must be a lot of elderly people stuck with worse situations with no such strong support networks and good government services as our grandma had around the country, though.

I know China has an issue with similar mass attacks but using knives or makeshift explosives. So maybe just growing in large powerful states makes you more likely to be mentally ill and go for such an attack. It may also be tied to the media coverage of such attacks as well. 

Either way we definitely need to research a root cause of mass shootings because guns don't seem to be that cause.

1329,"You are wrong again. This is the reason that Ukrainians are dying- *the Russian invasion, Putin*:

**Russian aggression against Ukraine has left about 9940 people killed and up to 23455 wounded (UN data). This number includes, in particular, 298 passengers of MH17 flight, including 80 children, killed as a result of terrorist attack on 17 July 2014, when the Malaysian Airlines plane was shot down by the Russian servicemen from BUK missile system that had been transferred to the occupied territory of Donbas from the Russian Federation.**

**About 1.584.000 residents of Crimea and Donbas are now internally displaced persons after being compelled to leave their homes.**

**As of today Russia continues to illegally occupy Ukraine’s Autonomous Republic of Crimea (26 081 km²), the city of Sevastopol (864 km²), certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions (16799 km²) — in total 43744 km² or 7,2% of the territory of Ukraine.**

**The occupied areas have become a territory of fear and terror, the occupying authorities act by repressive measures, resorting to systematic and large-scale violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Alarming human rights situation in occupied Crimea was condemned by the UN General Assembly Resolution 71/205 «Situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (Ukraine)», adopted on 19 December 2016.**

**Economy of Donbas has been completely destroyed. Equipment of main industrial facilities of Donbas was dismantled and transported to the territory of Russia. Situation with flooded mines threatens environmental disaster. Russian authorities do not allow access of experts for assessing the threats and seeking ways to mend the situation.**

**A 409,7 km section of the Ukrainian-Russian state border in the east remains out of control by the Government of Ukraine.**

1429,"&gt; You act like European countries haven’t caused probably the most mayhem and destruction globally compared to almost any other continent in the past 1000 years.
&gt;

They objectively haven't. As just one counter example, Mongolian conquests killed more people as a percentage of global population than any other series of conquests in history. Nazis killed around 4% of the global population, Mongol conquests may have been as high as 30%. And that's one example. No European crime is unique, in scope or horror. 

You're a product of amazing merger of extreme eurocentrism with progressivism that ends up with people genuinely believing no one outside of Europe ever did anything wrong and that the world is divided into ""Europeans"" and ""not Europeans"" as if no one had any history of their own or any history with each other but only with Europeans. 

Last two points, 1) US colonized as well, both soft power (Monroe Doctrine) and hard power (Philippines, Cuba, Hawaii), 2) collective guilt is illegal (established by Nuremberg trials), illogical and immoral and assigning guilt to countries is stupid. Vast majority of African Americans were sold as slaves by West African rulers, if you want to assign collective guilt that means what, black people are guilty for black people's enslavement?

Talgo created a system that can change trains gauge in movement in quite a few time but high speed trains no longer run in the iberian gauge but the international one.

But the system is still in place in most highspeed trains so we can use it on older rails that are iberian gauge.

That is why most of our High speed rail network has talgo rolling stock.

Beside of regular tapping when the bartender pours beer to match the 0,5 L line and then adds froth, there's *""hladinka""* (level) when the bartender fills the glass on one stroke which is supposed to make beer tastier but it takes a skilled bartender to match the line this way. Then there are nowadays less common styles of tapping, *šnyt* (pouring 300 ml of beer in 500 ml glass and fill the rest with froth), *mlíko* (""milk"", only the froth, it was supposed to be drunk as an alternative to a shot of hard liquor between beers), and *čochtan* (""swimmer""; beer with no froth supposed to be chugged immediately).

This is purely a consumer protection decision.

I urge you to look at case of Ruxley Electronics v Forsyth (1996)

Mr Forsyth commissioned a swimming pool. It ended up being six inches shallower at the deep end than it should have been.

Mr Forsyth won his case - it was a breach of contract. But he couldn't claim the full cost of the swimming pool (over £20k). He got about £2k for 'loss of amenity'.

Palestinians started everything when they tried to exterminate the Jews. They hated the Jewish refugees from other countries and wanted them to go somewhere else. Palestinians were fueled by Arab Nationalism and Anti Semitism. The former was also directed against us. Did I also mention that the Arabs sided with the British against their muslim fellows, the Turks?

Arabs lost to Israelis 4 times. Arabs could have reconquered Palestine. But they couldn't. Palestinians were displaced because of these wars and the intercommunal conflict started by them.

I get the presented concern over Gibraltar's tax status... I'm concerned about its tax status too, and tax avoidance in general, hell I'm concerned about London, Amsterdam, Belgium, and Luxembourg... The concerns would be a little more authentic sounding from Spanish ministers if it wasn't for the Canary Islands', Zona Especial Canarias, and their 4% corporate tax rates... everybody forgets the Canaries are extra-territorial to the EU.

Now I know about the ZEC qualification restrictions, but I've lived in the Canaries and worked for a company that made use of ZEC provisions to move it's IT department into its own silo as a ""new-media"" company and start ramming money through that. There aren't so much loopholes in ZEC as signposted motorways.

In general, the amount of black money sloshing around the Canaries, is incredible, second only to places like, well Gibraltar.

If we're going to have a conversation about tax-avoidance in Europe, let's do that, and discuss all the actors involved. Let's not make it about Gibraltarian self-determination. It's not convincing, as I'm not seeing the Spanish concerns expressed over Andora.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijanis_in_Armenia

&gt;Tensions rose again after both Armenia and Azerbaijan became briefly independent from the Russian Empire in 1918. Both quarreled over where their common borders lay.[20] Warfare coupled with the influx of Armenian refugees resulted in widespread massacres of Muslims in Armenia[21][22][23][24][25] causing virtually all of them to flee to Azerbaijan.[18] 

&gt;Andranik Ozanian and Rouben Ter Minassian were particularly prominent in the destruction of Muslim settlements and in the planned ethnic homogenisation of regions with once mixed population through populating them with Armenian refugees from Turkey.[26] Ter Minassian, displeased with the fact that Azeris in Armenia lived on fertile lands, waged at least three campaigns aimed at cleansing Azeris from 20 villages outside Erivan, as well as in the south of the country. According to French historian (and Ter Minassian's daughter-in-law) Anahide Ter Minassian, to achieve his goals, he used intimidation and negotiations, but above all, ""fire and steel"" and ""the most violent methods to 'encourage' Muslims in Armenia"" to leave.[27]

&gt;Though Azeris were represented by three delegates in an 80-seat Armenian parliament (much more modestly than Armenians in the Azerbaijani parliament), they were universally targeted as ""Turkish fifth columnists"".[27] In his June 1919 report, Anastas Mikoyan stated that ""the organised extermination of the Muslim population in Armenia threatened to result in Azerbaijan declaring a war [against Armenia] any minute"".[28] According to British reports, some 250 Muslim villages had been burnt in the eastern Caucasus as a result of a killing spree initiated by Armenian units led by Andranik Ozanian.[29]

&gt;By 1979, Azeris numbered 160,841 and constituted 5.3% of Armenia's population.[38] **The Azeri population of Yerevan, that once formed the majority, dropped to 0.7% by 1959** and further to 0.1% by 1989.[34]

Could someone please clarify if this is correct:

""Terrorists have long used cellular phones to trigger improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in their attacks throughout the world. Although the time lapse between the activation of the cell-phone trigger and the explosion detonation has been only seconds in some bombings, one London terrorist bomb took nearly an hour to detonate after the initial attacks. This extended time lapse between triggering and detonation indicates that cell-phone signal jamming equipment could be used to prevent cell-phone detonation of explosives. 

A jamming device blocks the cellular downlink frequencies, preventing a cell phone's ability to receive an incoming call (uplink capabilities still function); however, it cannot prevent a cell phone's alarm function from detonating a bomb. One expert estimates that jamming equipment can obstruct half of all cell-phone bombs, along with remotely controlled bombs that use other remote instruments, such as garage door openers or toys. Separate equipment exists that can prevent bombs that use the cell-phone alarm function. 

U.S. Federal law currently allows only Federal law enforcement agents to use such jamming equipment. Because of delayed Federal response to bomb discoveries at the local level, many local police agencies favor being allowed to purchase and use jamming equipment. The Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet Association is currently working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to develop a protocol that will retain Federal authority for determining when and how jamming equipment will be used, while allowing for a Federal directive that allows a specific use of jamming equipment by local police.

But the British soon let Jewish merchants into the city. In 1749 the first synagogue was opened, which together with three others is still in operation today. It was mainly Sephardim from today's Morocco who came, descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain. The Jewish community grew to almost 2,000 members in the 19th century, almost half of the civilian population. 

A whopping two thousands after a hundred years of occupation? So between 20-30%, depending on the year and population.

Pretty sure Leon, Galicia and almost every city in Italy united voluntarily, contributing to the union. This was not the case of Catalonia, which was forced to union after losing a war, eliminating its institutions and imposing on it a foreign language (Spanish), institutions and laws.

&gt;  you would have been part of Spain either way because you were before.

From Wikipedia: *Following Catalan surrender on 11 September 1714, the Spanish king Philip V of Bourbon, inspired by the model of France imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the [Nueva Planta decrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Planta_decrees), banning the main Catalan political institutions and rights and merged into Castile.*

We were not ""part of Spain"" before that. In the sense that Castile had its laws, its parliament, its institutions, its language, etc. And we in Catalonia had ours, different from theirs. But after 1714, they abolished the [Catalan parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Courts), our institutions, our Catalan language and everything that basically constituted Catalonia.

This is not where a EU directive is about. It's not restricted if the aggregator summarizes what the link is about. It's only (possibly) subject to this new right if they take over a substantial part of the original press publication.

2218,"So as someone from Spain, I can say with confidence that 99% of Spaniards don't give a fuck about Gibraltar and its inhabitants.

However, what most people here care about, especially the Southern Andalusians who live near the Rock itself, is the fact that it's a money laundering tax heaven. 
Fun fact: There are 2 fucking companies for every person living in Gibraltar. In comparison, Ceuta and Melilla, our enclaves off the coast of Morocco pay the same taxes as we do here in the peninsula itself and are by all account and measures just another part of the country. Also, let's lest not forget this about the ""Chief"" of Gibraltar (also translated from Spanish through Google Translate, fyi):

&gt;""His residence outside Gibraltar is located in the elitist urbanization of Sotogrande (San Roque, Cadiz), the favorite of the potentates of the Rock, where they enjoy large mansions impossible to build in the small and steep dimensions of the British colony.  This is a home of more than 250 square meters on a plot of 1,600 ... acquired an apartment in an elegant urbanization of Benahavis (Malaga), next to Marbella.  It is a luxury complex, with five outdoor swimming pools and one more heated one, sauna, jacuzzi and security 24 hours a day.  The value of the apartment was around 400,000 euros.  ""


&gt;Picard, like the vast majority of his compatriots, does not pay taxes in Spain, as he does not live here more than 180 days a year.  However, the Treasury suspects that there are not a few Gibraltarians who spend more time in Spain than in the Rock but do not notify it so as not to pay taxes.

&gt;In fact, the Government estimates that there are 6,700 Gibraltarians who actually live in Spain, enjoying the golf courses, marinas and infrastructure paid for by the Andalusian taxpayer.

Those are the real reasons why I believe that Gibraltar should be Spanish. Or if not Spanish, at least some kind of in between, where both Spain and the Gibraltar agree to have the same tax regime and so on.

eg the capital's city government will rip out all the roads first and only then will they start allocating crews to repave them, so all the roads are unusable, but only some are actively being worked on, so that, even though they had the foresight to do this during the summer while there's as few cars on the roads as possible, the rush hour traffic is as bad if not worse do to a greatly diminished number of open roadways.

Why do they do it this way? A combination of incompetence and corruption mixed with hubris and apathy towards the citizens. Worse still, it's not like this attitude is limited to the top, it's the culture of not seeing rules as rules, just guidelines, that permeates every level of society that crumbles when it hits EU regulations that actually get enforced.

It's getting visibly better and people are figuring things out, but we're still suffering from the fact that rather than a revolution that kicked out the old political and economic regime, we had a war that essentially solidified the positions of the men mismanaging the country and only as they die out can we hope to make progress.

No really. Once country is deep into depts it sells property well bellow booked value. Effect of this policy is that some day more efficient countries will dominate economically less efficient and have direct economic control over later. This can be resisted by: raising efficiency of South (not likely), leaving Euro and devaluating (a bit more likely but still low), political pressure to establish firm and significant transfers (subsidies) from exporters to importers (the most probable outcome IMHO) for some kind political concesions.

From Germanic to Gallic, just these two people group definitions in particular have significant differences from what we know of them. From intertribal politics, rituals, customs, down to the clothes they wore.

Yes they may stem from a similar mother group, yet the terminology of Celt is not conducive to current academic understanding.

2425,"The UK Government at the time issued an executive order to the Civil Service forbidding them from planning for Leave actually winning the Brexit vote, the exact wording signed by Prime Minister David Cameron himself said they aren't to write a ""single piece of paper"" planning for that eventually.

Then the dude resigned the day after Leave won, despite the vote being his idea in the first place, and now he wants to get back into politics again...

It's one thing to show polls like this that say the majority of the UK population would vote to stay in the EU today, but they also showed that ever since the UK joined the EU and even in the days leading up to the referendum... But what is stupid, and something that gets missed a lot here on /r/Europe, is that ""voting intention"" and ""general feeling / mood / zeitgeist"" towards the EU are two totally separate things, and actually when it comes to putting your vote in the box, just like with Trump, people go with the second option not the first. Academic, internal government polls and private internal research by investment firms and banks like Goldman Sacks that have studied the latter, ""general feeling / mood / zeitgeist"" towards the EU, have always since the UK first joined shown the UK to be about 85% Eurosceptic, even today... There's hardly anyone onboard the, ""we truly love the EU with all our hearts and want to be one single country with one army one currency one president one legal system under Junker et al"" train, it's a tiny percentage of the population, even in heavily Remain voting places like Scotland. 

Also interestingly the more recent studies I've seen show a big shift amongst the young population, who are overwhelmingly Remainers, but there's also been a big 18% shift in the 18-27 year old generation in the ""general feeling / mood / zeitgeist"" studies showing they are moving into the Eurosceptic camp. So it seems the myth that Brexit was caused by old people and the UK will rejoin when the young grow up and have another referendum isn't actually reality.

I'd be extremely curious to see similar ""general feeling / mood / zeitgeist"" towards the EU polls from other EU countries, I'd be willing to bet they show a very very very different story from the data OP posted, (which has a pro-EU bias anyway so is academically worthless).",,/r/europe/comments/9zi8z4/eurobarometer_2018_if_a_eu_referendum_was_held/eaa0v2m/,UnsafestSpace,1542948104

2447,"&gt;I dont think the calculation is right worker=uneducated low skilled people.A lot of workers had a good work ethic, pressured their childten hard to achieve something in schools and university and reached a decent standard of living.


1) Having a good work ethic doesn't mean you're more educated and therefore more skilled.An engineer with a horrible work ethic who doesn't care about his job as long as he gets paid is still a high skilled worker.

2) ""A lot of workers"" as in what percentage you say ? I avoided saying ""all of them"" ""every immigrant"" etc because we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people if not millions here and ofcourse there will be better or worse among them.Doesn't mean the point about majority is wrong.


&gt;all kinds of people leave the Middle East and Turkey.They want a western standard of living even if you are a hardcore salafi.


We're talking about Turkey and Turkish immigration to Europe so I won't comment about the rest of ME but for Turkey,this is simply wrong.*Vast majority* of rligious and/or nationalist people in Turkey,who happen to be generally less educated,don't want that ""western standard of living"" at all.As I said,they worship their leader and his regime so they blatantly accuse secular,educated people who immigrate (And create a brain drain which Erdogan himself is trying to stop) of being ""traitors"" and stuff.

2632,"&gt;No. The EU Commissioners should be accountable to the European people, since they make the real decisions, they have the real power.

No wrong. EU is a triumvirate. Power of 3 between Parliament who represents the peoples interests, Council who represents state interests and Commission who represents the EU which each having power to keep others power in check.

&gt; Hence they should be elected by citizens if anything. Personally though I think we should get rid of the Commission, it's entirely redundant.

What a stupid idea. While we are at it let's just get rid of all executive branches yea like heads of state, governors, mayors fuck it all. No point in keeping Parliament and Council in check or having a representative body for EU interests. I mean it's not like EU heads of state and governments have other things to do lets have them run day to day operations of EU as well.

&gt;What a waste of time.

Yes we should just appoint anyone regardless of their history and qualifications. Who cares about whats true or false whats fact and what lies. You don't have to be intelligent to lead the union just need a lot of good words, best words.

&gt;They can only vote in favor or abstain, but they cannot vote to reject the commissioner which is BS.

Do you even know how EU works. Did you even bother to look at it. Also what reject the commissioner you know it's not a one person with all power vested in him right ? Also Council and Parliament most ceirtanly can reject legislation by Commission not just them but also certain subcommittees. 

&gt;Hasn't worked out so great.

Your personal opinion which is fine. Looking at world stage we are doing pretty great.

&gt;So you only want the people to have a say in politicians who have no power or influence over the country or countries they govern? Basically glorified actors and puppets? Well that sounds like a great deal, let's just trust that some unaccountable faceless bureaucrats have our best interests at heart.

WTF are you talking about. Pretty much everything is open in EU you know exactly how each member of parliament and council voted and who they are.

&gt;Really? The candidates tend to be scrutinized by media for months. Anyone who reads the news will know a lot about candidates, certainly a lot more than European citizens knew about any Commissioners who were chosen.

Sure that works great. People do get to chose their Commissioner just not directly as that would be inefficient and illogical. More power is vested in Parliament and you have multiple representatives there to vote on your behalf. You also have a representation in Council by your head of government.

Now, when the cherry trees bloom, everything is silent, we live in a very quiet place, some birds possibly, but definitely no bees anymore. And very few cherries. Strange...

Of course, direct observation is absolutely unscientific if we accuse the pesticides. Causes could be multiple, epidemic, new allergy to cherry pollen, some kind of beexit even, with good reason, everybody speaks french here.

2676,"&gt; EU is a triumvirate. Power of 3 between Parliament who represents the peoples interests

The EU parliament is a eunuch, which has no power or influence in the EU. They just get paid very nice salaries while approving terrible laws that come out of the Commission and their coporate lobbyists.

&gt;What a stupid idea. While we are at it let's just get rid of all executive branches yea like heads of state, governors, mayors fuck it all.

The EU is not and should not be a state.

&gt;No point in keeping Parliament and Council in check or having a representative body for EU interests.

Who keeps the Commission in check? Nobody, that's who.

&gt;Yes we should just appoint anyone regardless of their history and qualifications.

As I said the Commission is redundant, unelected and unaccountable, it should be abolished.

&gt;Also Council and Parliament most ceirtanly can reject legislation by Commission not just them but also certain subcommittees.

Laughable. They often have several votes for legislation, and can reintroduce the same crap over and over again until it goes their way. Then once it is European law, there is no way to remove it.

&gt;Looking at world stage we are doing pretty great.

You must be joking.

&gt;WTF are you talking about.

You said that you don't want people to vote for commissioners, who are the only people with real power in the EU.

&gt;Pretty much everything is open in EU you know exactly how each member of parliament and council voted and who they are.

Which is irrelevant, because I can't vote out a specific MEP or council member.

&gt;People do get to chose their Commissioner just not directly

So they don't get to choose their commissioner.

&gt;More power is vested in Parliament and you have multiple representatives there to vote on your behalf.

Isn't your letter ""Đ"" or ""đ"" sort of similar to ""Q""?

Either way, for me, if a Slav used it in a context which was not meant to be offensive, I wouldn't give two fucks about it. It's only when offense is intended that it becomes unpleasant.

I completely agree, which is why I'd never endorse federalising the EU *in its current form*. First, we have to make sure it's a real democracy and not just a veneer for it.

The only proper way to do it is a pan-European Constitutional Assembly comprised of real people from all levels of European society (not just 'x members from country Y"" - it's states, but cities and municipalities as well!), some of whom are elected as delegates, some of whom are found by way of [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition) (to make sure that not the usual selection of professional politicians are getting in) who draw up a European Constitution, are fully transparent about the process and put the results before the European people in *one* continent-wide referendum on *the same* day without the member states having anything to do with it so as to avoid any shenanigans in the first place.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9zdj2m/steve_bannon_i_want_to_drive_a_stake_through_the/ea97j33/,ColourFox,1542918835

Plus 4-6 weeks vacation (depends on the company of course and 4 weeks is the most common) and sick leave at full salary as well as similar benefits to allow Vabbing if you have kids. Tech is really valued there and in my experience they treat you well.

In Sweden the tech industry still feels a bit behind in terms of employee benefits. Swedes seem okay with it, but for me it was a big shock what they consider ""good benefits"".

This is trivia everyone can look up on Wikipedia and elsewhere. Why would you want to shit up the sub with this kind of stuff?

&gt;Maybe more ""series"" type of content?

Ah yes, highlights of the past include stuff like ""Offices of Europe"" and ""Toilets of Europe"". Who doesn't love it? Clearly a cultural high point for the sub.

3074,"&gt;I can only speak for myself and the people who've shared their opinion with me, but yeah we'd like to see Brexiteers get shocked at the events any sensible person has seen coming for years.

I don't want Brexit but I really hate this anti Brexiter attitude. If it was aimed at any other group it would be considered a hate crime.

Most Brexiters aren't rich snobby people they are poor people in areas that have been neglected for decades. Imagine if election after election you are told to do as you are told it's the best thing for you and yet nothing ever gets better? Wouldn't you take the gamble on making a change?

Same happened with Trump.

When the mainstream keeps failing people the people will take a gamble on the extremes in the hope something changes.

I don't believe this is the EU's fault it's the UK governments of all parties going back 30 or so years but desperate people make desperate decisions.

&gt; The Scotts almost declared independence before Brexit, if it becomes a reality despite most of the Scotts voting against it I don't have the slightest doubt they'll go through with it.

Except the polls so far show the opposite. The SNP actually lost seats in the last election and the Tories actually won a few which was unthinkable before. People would literally have laughed at you in the past 20 years if you said the Tories would win seats in Scotland.

&gt;I don't think London becoming independent is very realistic but the mayor of London (Khan) has said he wants it. Also IIRC there was a petition about it with lots of support, I don't remember the scale of it though.

As a Londoner it's never going to happen. We're not an island and the days of using the Thames as a major trading system are long gone. As much as London is the powerhouse of the UK and supports most of it we still geographically rely on the rest of the country. We'd basically be surrounded by pissed off people.

Additionally, a lot of international businesses with their headquarters in London are considering leaving the UK for a EU country due to Brexit, London staying in the EU would stop this and save London from losing these big tax-sources.

That’s ultimate authoritarian power without any checks and balances for you. People can vote out PiS from power, nothing can discipline corrupted judge.

Spain

&gt;In Spain, judges are selected by the General Council of the Judiciary, roughly the counterpart of Poland’s KRS. The council is headed by the president of the country’s Supreme Court, and its remaining 20 members are selected by the parliament by a three-fifths majority from among candidates recommended by the Electoral Commission operating out of the Supreme Court.

Germany

&gt;The five most important judicial institutions in Germany are the Federal Court of Justice, the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Fiscal Court, and the Federal Administrative Court. They are roughly equivalent to Poland’s Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court. Under the German constitution, candidates for judges on these courts are named by the federal minister of justice and by a 32-member recruitment commission (of which 16 members are selected by the parliament and the other 16 by the justice ministers of the country’s individual states).
&gt;The same commission selects judges for the five courts. The appointments are subject to approval by the German federal government. Once such approval is granted, the country’s president formally appoints a judge.
&gt;All this goes to show that judges in Germany are selected by politicians.

Netherlands

&gt;judges are appointed by royal decree. This takes place at the request of the justice minister. Candidates are named by the country’s Council for the Judiciary, which is half composed of judges selected by members of the judicial community. If there are two candidates for one spot, the justice minister makes the final choice.

It goes into alot of depth and detail, the wider context, plus it explores pre-Viking Scandanavian culture and peoples as well, not just the usual blood and guts, war, raping n pilaging affair etc, its partly about why the Vikings did what they did and how &amp; why they became what they became, their legacy etc. You should defo give it a watch if you wanna find out more about the Vikings. I highly reconmend it. Its easily the best programme on the vikings that ive seen imo.

&gt; Zwar ist Snus seit 1991 offiziell verboten. Aber weil Kautabak gleichzeitig legal ist, konnte das Produkt lange Zeit unter diesem Namen importiert werden. Der Etikettenschwindel funktionierte – bis im Sommer 2016 das Bundesamt für Gesundheit (BAG) aktiv wurde.
Mit einer Weisung beriefen sich die Behörden auf das alte Verbot, und seither herrscht die totale Verwirrung. Denn mit Logik ist die neue Regelung vom BAG nur schwer erklärbar.

Here we are looking for outcome=death with cause=cancer.   
How is a death from pneumonia due to lowered immunity or general weakness due to chemotherapy counted? And is it counted the same in Iceland as in Latvia?   
How is a death from heart attack counted in a person with prostate cancer? How is it counted if it was due to rare complication from cancer-fighting drug? OR if it was due to an unforeseen reaction to anesthesia during surgery?   
What if it is a hospital-acquired infection that is the proximate cause of death? If you caught it because you were at the hospital for a routine post cancer-surgery check?
 
I don't know if other nations list secondary causes of death in their paperwork (I know we do in Finland) - for countries that do list it, are those deaths counted as cancer deaths? (I guess that would be the pneumonia example above)

PiS base has nobody to revert to... except PiS. Worse case scenario these people will stay at home during elections. Saying that PiS is deteriorating. Their 5 minutes passed and they will focus on themselves from now, hoping to get something tangible for their ""duty"". Sad.

&gt; This will have impact on PIS as a party but i don't think **people on the ""left"" will be happy about it.**

They won't be, it is obvious. Duda tried to please them incurring huge loss in support yet he is still called ""PiS's president"". They won't be happy until all changes made by PiS will be reverted ""dictatorship of losers"".

&gt; Only **reasonable** explanation to me seems to be smokescreen toward other changed which they didn't remove.

PiS and reasonable...  They are loud but spineless. They have not the greatest track record of being tough.

&gt; Either way i expect they will go back to this later.

Or this is tactic to bet high, back down a little but be happy with final outcome because true goal was much more limited?

&gt; This will be great case for PIS to get more votes in next election.

3354,"The UK’s economy is also stagnant and the UK is also one of the few European countries to see significant wage decline. The UK also has a aging population and the biggest reason that it is growing at such a high rate is due to such large amounts of immigration. The elderly were a big driving force for the Brexit vote and why the Conservatives are in power. After all when they introduced austerity measures they didn’t go after pensions but cut services that tended to used by the young and raised the tuition fees. It is also clear that the policies they tend to support, poll best with older demographics. 

The EU doesn’t actually introduce internet laws that often, the last major update to the copyright directive was in 2001 and even if Article 13 passes it wouldn’t be the end of the world. Tech companies are use to complying to a multitude of regulations and find innovative ways to make it work. The EU is also a huge market, that they wouldn’t want to shut themselves off from. The UK also has a pretty poor track record when it comes to internet issues, with many politicians signalling their attempt to control the internet, with plans to do a similar thing but those were watered down. Quite a few websites were geoblocked by court order and there is online surveillance. There are also things like what got called the snoopers charter, a encryption ban (just to show how little they understand the internet) and proposed porn credit card filters so it is clear where the intention of those politicians lies. So don’t pretend that this is just an EU problem and the UK would likely be affected by such laws regardless, especially as companies aren’t going to want to get shut out of that market so they will try to comply regardless. 

There is also a reason why Europe doesn’t have a Silicon Valley and that is because there isn’t such a large poll of talent concentrated in one place and Silicon Valley had a huge head start as well as tech centric universities near by. Tech companies as in other companies also like the homogeneous regulations as it make their business much easier to operate, being in the EU gives that over a wide area. Which is something that would be less of the case in a third country that is choosing to diverge, making it look less attractive.

3411,"I don't think that if a new country were to adopt the US Constitution they would pass the scrutiny from the CoE. It works for the US somehow

There are a few differences however:

* SCOTUS serves functions both of a supreme court (last instance of appeal) as well as of constitutional court and for disputes against or between States.  
In most European countries the supreme and constitutional courts are divided
* The US works under a common law system, judges are therefore more powerful, supreme court judges can rewrite laws pretty much, European supreme courts mostly can just tell lower judges to ignore the law. Constitutional courts, which can strike down laws entirely are often appointed by the different branches of government

And the partisanship on the US supreme court is appalling, especially for a body serving a life term which can functionally circumvent the legislature so long as the right case gets in front of them. 

As an example in Italy we have a constitutional court made of 15 judges.

* 5 are elected by the judiciary top bodies
* 5 are selected by the President (which is a different thing from your President by the way)
* 5 are elected by the whole parliament, by supermajority

LO is as good, maybe even better. However that does matter
little since the MS lock-in is only in part due to brand marketing
or customer ignorance.

The real issue is availability of third party “AddIn”s (extensions
/ plugins in MS parlance): those are tied to the Office distribution
and its proprietary APIs. These usually provider calendar
synchronization, telephony integration, automation of customer
relations (Outlook as CRM is as bizarre and inefficient as it is
widely practiced), etc. Those can’t be migrated or replaced
because as a rule they’re as proprietary as Office, and often
vendors don’t care to support anything besides the 32 bit
version of it on Windows (yes, this is still the case in 2018).

Since all those little helpers can’t work outside the Office
ecosystem or Windows, alternative platforms and office

The commies understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these policies, to realise that they're not just correct- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the PRC truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Xi's existential catchphrase ""China will Rise"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Mao's epic Quotations From Chairman Mao.

3803,"Well, regarding ZSO you answered your own question, although I can elaborate on that one a bit further. The way it was drafted by Thaci and his group of subordinates, which is also a reflecting of how he sees drafting policy is that it was poorly drafted to the point where it broke several points of Kosovo's constitution. Apparently the Serbian side saw the stupidity in him and bargained him to sign on it.

The EU doesn't necessarily like Thaci or believe him to be more compromise oriented and what I'm about to say is a bit to controversial but he has dragged the EU to very low levels with his negotiations that they have to see things through with him due to the way he has dictated the rules of the game. Thaci has acted upon himself rather than ask for legitimacy in the parliament to approve the agreements done on Brussels, in a way the same thing was done by Serbia as well, although I believe they did send the agreements to be ratified in the parliament, something that Thaci didn't.

Here is where the story gets a bit sweeter... The current status of Thaci is quite diminished in Kosovo to the point where even his former party isn't in align with his side of arguments for the final agreement. He has no support from either side, and thats why he is seeking for Putin's and Trump's approval to facilitate the deal. The 'belief' or the 'presumption' from domestic policy advisors here is that Ramush did the tax tariff as a double edge sword, to punish Serbia for Interpol who as a result would pull out of negotiations and also to delay or hinder any role Thaci can have in the negotiation table. Power play between leaders, but for which in my own opinion is a very smart move. Thaci's decision making and agreements have all been made to make himself look good and as a 'succesful' leader but all his decisions have only made unrests and instability. People have started to notice that, politicians as well and thus they wan't to stop him before its too late.

I might have over-exaggerated with my argument but this is what the game is dictating out to be. A mix of many components, many players and many actions propelling one thing after the other.  


EDITED: One explanation about Thaci's cry for help to Putin and Trump: he want's their support knowingly that if they align with him, the opposition or the government here won't have a say on this. They are the big powers and the only ones who can overrule the legitimacy of our government with their influence. If they see Thaci fit, the others will have to bend to their will.

3869,"once a50 is invoked, it cannot be stopped. Two years after notification, unless the rEU agrees to an extension, the UK will be out by default, without any parliamentary approval being needed.

The only way it can be stopped is to revoke a50. However, it is not clear how revoking of a50 works. 

There are two scenarios that could unfold:

1) a50 can be revoked unilaterally without the consent of the remaining members of the EU. In this case it is crucial to understand who can do that. The case put forward by Gina Miller makes it clear that the PM cannot do it (e.g. using royal prerogative) without parliamentary consent. And who would vote for a revoke of a50? Certainly not the 80+ pro brexit Tories, so May would need a substantial part of the Labour MPs to revolt against Corbyn and his party line (and he already said that he's against a second referendum, let alone stopping brexit altogether).

2) revoking a50 would need the approval of the remaining 27 members. Even in this case it's a huge challenge. It would need the unanimous approval of all members and the Tories have already damaged much of the goodwill needed for that.

So, unless you can demonstrate that a sizeable part of the Labour MPs defy Corbyn and vote against his party whip, the numbers are against you. And that even takes for granted that the Tory MPs in favour of a soft brexit will vote for the revoke or for a second referendum.",South Tyrol,/r/europe/comments/9z3wf9/theresa_may_threatens_no_brexit_at_all/ea79sqh/,standy85,1542847678

However, Vučić is in better position - he's got a very firm grip on power in Serbia, and is a drama queen and par excellence media manipulator, so he can slowly accustom and soften citizens of Serbia towards a land swap deal. 

Thaci not so much... He's been trying to force a deal through, by playing the same drama Vučić is, by being the darling of the West (building a statesman persona), and in the meantime, floating the land swap idea. However, he's not in such good position in Kosovo, population / opposition there is much more stubborn.

Two of the problems are that Europe isn't a single country - it's still fractured, so all of the above resources still can't be focused as easily.  

And secondly, failure is seen as part of the game over there, it's a numbers game, trial by fire kind of thing. Not everyone can be a winner but if you get enough people to try things then some of them might come out with the right idea. We already know this is true, which is why Europeans are so big on universal access to education - in order to not let all of our brain power go to waste and to empower more people to reach their potential.

Iohannis responded to these allegations by accusing Laufer of “educational shortcomings”.

Following his rejection by the president, Laufer – a jew born in Bucharest (according to him, he was actually born in Rishon LeZion, Israel, soruce: https://m.jpost.com/Opinion/Grapevine-Hebrew-in-Romania-481838/amp?fbclid=IwAR0uAoyN8o3hpXjguR6LCf9XzjzFBfS9MKKnflIdZrC2TP2rvOzH31KZC9g), according to his declarations – accused Iohannis of anti-Semitism on Tuesday.

The president responded on Wednesday to Laufer by accusing him of educational shortcomings.

“Ilan Laufer dropped the maturity test, preferring to play the role of mouthpiece of PSD propaganda. Characters that make such scandalous accusations automatically disqualify and cannot occupy any high dignity in the Romanian state,” Iohannis said.

Iohannis also rejected the nomination of Olguta Vasilescu for the position of minister of Transports. Olguta Vasilescu is a former member of the notorious anti-Semite party PRM but is currently the vice-president of PSD.

Countries in danger territory are dealt with on a case by case basis. Consistent rules are impossible at this level because situations are so different and consequences so severe. If a country can prove it is temporarily exceeding the limit to structurally improve its economy and it can bear that temporary increase the regulators will still start procedures but probably conclude that fining is counterproductive as the country is taking measures.

Exactly. And it was actually pushed by the CIA. Those are official documents that have been released to public, not made up conspiracy theories. The operation didn't go ahead because JFK blokced it in the end but until that point it was authorized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States.

The fact that you haven't heard of anyone being killed by a spy doesn't mean that it doesn't happen. The weird thing would have been if you heard about it. That's the point of a fucking spy killing someone. ""I never heard about it"" does not mean that a spy hasn't killed someone. If anything it might mean quite the opposite, that the job was done correctly.

4397,"The real fun part? German authorities will still not allow him to drive.


Germany generally doesn't accept licenses acquired during the blocking period (during which you are not allowed to acquire a new license in Germany) or if the authorities ordered an MPU (a psychiatric test to figure out if you are capable of driving a potentially deadly machine around other people). And they also don't accept foreign licenses that were acquired without actually living there. 

-----

&gt; Anyone who has had their driving licence permanently revoked may be thinking of obtaining a foreign driving licence by detour. The Federal Administrative Court has now issued a verdict against a trick.
&gt;
&gt; The German plaintiff's driving licence had been revoked due to drunk driving. Therefore, he had obtained a driving licence with a mock residence in the Czech Republic. When the driving licence authority learned of this, it denied him the right to drive in Germany with this driving licence. After he had moved his residence to Austria, the plaintiff exchanged his Czech driving licence for an Austrian one. He was not allowed to drive that in Germany either, the driving licence authority subsequently stated.  
&gt; 
&gt; The Federal Administrative Court confirmed the view that, where it is established that a driving licence was issued by a Member State of the European Union in breach of the condition of normal residence, that defect is also attributable to the driving licence for which that licence was subsequently exchanged in another Member State, according to the Court's communication. Otherwise, the driving licence issued by the Czech authorities in manifest breach of the residence requirement would, as a result of the ""renewal"" of an exchange in another Member State, become binding on the territory of the Federal Republic.

Things or ideas? Because an idea and a teaspoon live in different worlds, as even Plato has noticed. Your idea belongs to you until you've pronounced it. After that it lives in any brain and can evolve independently within different souls embraced your initial idea. That's how our culture is evolving, sporadically, each individual contribute a little to the whole idea, which has no author. Who is Rubens if not a mere Caravaggist? Who is Caravaggio if not a  Cesari's pupil (added nothing but shadows, such a minor detail). Who is the author, where one's idea begins and ends. 

You can sell paintings or software support (or binary blobs), but the idea of owning an idea (song, text, music etc) is ridiculous (owning, not being considered an author), these do no exist in physical world and ""copied"" at once when they are heard/seen. 10 years is no way better than 70.

4548,"That's not an easy subject to explain in detail. This is civil law, so it starts with a claim where f.i. the rights holder claims that their rights are violated or where YouTube doesn't follow up on an agreement. All of this is way more complex that f.i. a fine for breaking speed limits. Keep in mind that the proposal is still negotiated in a trilogue, with proposals form commission, parliament (the amendments) and council, which still need to be concluded in a compromise.

** Content ID: A rights holder should substantiate that Content ID (or other measures to prevent copyright infringement like curation) isn't an ""appropriate and proportionate"" way to protect their rights. 

More like is a violation of this part of the proposal, ""the service providers shall provide rightholders with adequate information on the functioning and the deployment of the measures, as well as, when relevant, adequate reporting on the recognition and use of the works and other subject-matter."" At this moment there are disputes between copyright holders and YouTube. [link](https://themusicnetwork.com/ifpi-boss-on-youtube-claims-it-is-difficult-to-get-any-clarity-on-googles-claims/) (I don't know if this article reflects the truth, it's just to illustrate what the problem is about) 

** complaints and redress mechanisms. At this point that system is user-unfriendly, for a big part automated and too slow. It's expected that it should be able to handle complaints in 48 hours and probably more manual intervention is expected. But also, ""rightsholders shall duly justify the reasons to remove or block access [...]"" In short, the mandatory system will very different from DMCA obligations or what they voluntarily do. This gives users much more rights, and parties like YouTube rather don't want to give the users more rights.

Appealing to these decisions will have to take place in an independent body, and not in-company.

** Apart from this, parties like YouTube will have to me more approachable to copyright holders in member states (where at this point there's almost no communication and no possibility to even call them by phone). In the proposal that's called ""the cooperation between the *intermediate* and rightholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices"" (this will be facilitated by the member state, so again: not in-company)

The result of all of this is not really that YouTube violates anything, but this can lead to YouTube being liable (= SHARED responsibility) for copyright infringement by individual uploaders. You can pretty much compare this to Facebook being liable for violation of the privacy laws in member states. With the difference that at this point individual member states can't really cooperate against Facebook/YouTube and in the future, with a common approach and shared *directive* those violations can (and will) be seen as a EU-wide violation, rather than a nation-wide violation of copyright infringement.

A lot of times you read stuff like *""it is safer for them to just remove EVERYTHING to not get sued""*. This is not the case. Just blocking content that doesn't violate copyright law will cause similar problems and will almost certainly lead to fines.

---

Keep in mind, all together these issues for YouTube are still rather small. The directives dsn't really *target* YouTube, but rather *intermediates* who don't do anything about copyrights and keep on claiming that they are not responsible for whatever uploaders want to share.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA (deep breath) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

If you think that European countries have any meaningful independence from the USA tyranny, you're wrong.  Sure, they make noise.  But when it comes down to action?  Every time they tuck their tails in and show their bellies.  

The USA creates its own problems. In 1945 it decided to divide Korea. About half a million people died in the eventual war, leading to the deadly impasse today. In the 1970s it decided to arm Islamists in Afghanistan, turning it into the jihadist playground it is today. In the 1990s, it decided to embrace former Warsaw pact countries while isolating Russia itself, leading to today's tense standoff. Then there's Vietnam, Iraq, etc., etc. America has been ""great"" for far too long, and millions have died because of it.

The world is sick of a 'strong America' striding the globe arrogantly, visiting war, mayhem, regime change and murderous interventions with impunity. The legacy, still continuing since WWII has been a global holocaust of peoples who've died, been injured as a result of the US's cult of impunity, acting as a rogue state outside international law. Many have got so used to US global behavior they accept the rogue state to act as it wants, without constraint or recourse to international law.

Remember their illegal invasion of Iraq some 15 years ago? Libya? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? During this period they have been riding roughshod over international law creating chaos and mass murder wherever they go and displacing millions of innocent people.

&gt;Fifteen years ago, the prominent political analyst Samuel Huntington, professor of the science of government at Harvard, warned in the establishment journal Foreign Affairs that for much of the world the U.S. was ""becoming the rogue superpower... the single greatest external threat to their societies."" Shortly after, his words were echoed by Robert Jervis, the president of the American Political Science Association: ""In the eyes of much of the world, in fact, the prime rogue state today is the United States."" As we have seen, global opinion supports this judgment by a substantial margin.

&gt;
&gt;[Reuters : Violent crime rises in Germany and is attributed to refugees](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-crime-idUSKBN1ES16J)

Yes. [Germany](https://www.bmfsfj.de/blob/121226/0509c2c7fc392aa88766bdfaeaf9d39b/gutachten-zur-entwicklung-der-gewalt-in-deutschland-data.pdf)  has seen an overall reduction in violent crime *overall* since 2007, and if one looks at anything but ""leichte Körperverletzung"", meaning something like ""minor injury"" in a criminal context, since 1939 (but this is only data since 1998). 

Even with the refugee crisis, violent crime was worse in 2007. Maybe the refugee are capable of time travel or something, who knows.

&gt;&gt;Violent crime is at least in f.e. Germany largely right-wing
&gt;
&gt;[Antifa in Germany Publish Rioting How-To Booklet](https://capitalresearch.org/article/antifa-in-germany-publish-rioting-how-to-booklet/)

That's not violent crime, and it's a booklet, not a crime statistic. 

Left-wing crime is largely property crime, right-wing crime is (ignoring right-wing specific hate speech/Widerbetätigung crimes) violent crime. Right-wingers in Germany murder people every year. 


&gt;&gt;What right could I protect that now is violated if only I had a Magnum in the night stand?
&gt;
&gt;See above. Anyone throwing a molotov cocktail/stones at any other citizen should be terminated with extreme prejudice.

""The right to play Judge Dredd""? 

&gt; Women who are targets of rapists should defend themselves by neutralizing the threat.

That isn't an answer to my question either, it's a call to action towards female rape ""targets"" (and isn't that a weird choice of words)

&gt;I know... not EVERYONE is going to die from a molotov or stone, so take the risk to your life/property, don't exercise your right to speak, assemble, enjoy your freedom. 

You do realise of course that throwing for bombs is illegal in, presumably, every EU country?

&gt; Not EVERY WOMAN is going to suffer permanent damage or death from rape, so why shoot and perhaps kill her rapist?

Which European country has laws in which deadly force is not permissible in such situations?

&gt; You somehow think the life of a vermin is worth the health and liberty of innocent people.

I think that people aren't vermin, ""health and liberty"" is an equivocation/bait-and-switch, and the criminal innocence or guilt of people is determined in a court of law, not by edgelords on the internet.

4669,"I get the findings but for tech I feel I should clarify, Sweden is pretty abysmal. Migration issues, for one, are a big reason why folks leave and even if an administrative or employer mistake is made the employee is punished by migrationsverket. Not to mention in big cities immigrants are tricked into thinking typical salaries are lower (t. ex. Trying to make people believe 40000 sek is decent salary when citizens will make 60-70k for the same position)

Also the health coverage is not great for at least the Stockholm area and benefits offered by many companies are pretty sad in terms of pension and warrants.

It's getting better here though. The government is in collaboration with a company that is trying to improve the tech employment landscape.

Still, IF you work tech, I'd argue the US is definitely better than Sweden as you and your family will end up with better quality of life over all since tech in the US is heavily invested in (not just due to salary but due to pension and healthcare as well as maternal/paternal leave). Is it better than Germany? Maybe not, and of course it's only one field. 

I also think it's easier in Sweden for EU citizens since migration isn't a problem. I wonder if this was accounted for in the survey. I also think that given the separate study on competition, it may be that more competitive countries have a higher entry barrier and therefore might make them less attractive since it is harder to penetrate the field there. These things considered it was an interesting read, but since it is just survey data of course it's to be taken with a grain of salt. Would be nice to hear Europe getting more workers though.

4688,"&gt; World War II was started by two countries, Nazi-Germany and the Soviet Union

No it wasn't, even though it is a common trope nowadays. You could even argue that Poland has started WWII by invading Czechoslovakia, which was an ally of USSR at the time - which USSR actually let slide. If Germany didn't start invasions, Soviet Union would not have acted, as the war was disastrous for Soviet economy, and the Red Army was not ready for the conflict.

Before invasion of Poland, Soviet Union spent 2 years trying to convince European powers (namely UK and France) to stop Germany, because Stalin understood that Germany's military advance will never stop in Poland and will go to USSR, which was not ready for the massive warfare at the time. Yet European powers decided to neglect the warnings and adopted appeasing stance, and Munich decision in 1938 drove Stalin furious. But apparently UK &amp; France were happy to see the mad German clashing with the mad Russian, and Nazi ideology was far, far more popular among the UK elites than Soviet (which is a documented fact).

All the decisions that were made by the Soviet Union were aimed at stalling German forces, by shifting the borders further away from USSR, which was the cause of the North war and invasion of Poland. Molotov-Ribbentrop pact (signed a year after the Munich decision) mirrored existing NAPs European countries already had with Germany.

And as history shows, that was the correct decision from the point of USSR. Even with all these measures, Moscow almost fell, and USSR lost over 3 million people in the first two years. Without the invasion of Poland, the consequences would've been far worse for USSR, and the Kursk battle might have never happened.

It doesn't diminish the war crimes that were committed by Soviet Union in trying to achieve that, but it doesn't mean that USSR was interested in conquering as Germany was. Soviet ideology at the time was not about fanning the flames of world revolution (like it was under Lenin), it was focused inwards, and the war was defensive in essence. Nazi Germany ideology, on the opposite, was offensive and bent on conquest. 

I understand the reasons why people who suffered at the hands of the Red Army try to force the trope of ""USSR is as guilty as Germany"", but it is beating the dead horse. The intent and actions were very different.",Russia,/r/europe/comments/9yrktu/today_in_1945_was_the_start_of_the_nürnberg_trials/ea5mnfd/,Sarkat11,1542789887

Colonialism wasn't the best course of action, but it had benefits. No place in the world was free from these issues, especially not Africa. You'll find that somebody who would have died from some disease (or some other reason), due to lack of medical knowledge, would potentially disagree about colonialism being bad, as compared to somebody who was sold as a slave because of it.

Neither in NH. So explain the disparity. One (NH) has minimal gun controls (basically just a background check is buying from an FFL) and the others (ex. Latvia) is extremely restrictive with few households with guns (&lt;5%).

&gt;of course one can defend themselves and their property.

Tell me which EU country allows a woman who is a target of a rapist to shoot her assailant. Tell me which EU country allows a woman to shoot an intruder. Tell me which EU country allows a woman to shoot a man who is physically assaulting her. Or did you mean defend as in use corresponding force? You know, go blow for blow against a 100kg man?

&gt;Rule of law is important.

If you mother/wife/daughter ever gets raped, you tell her how important the laws are to protect the life of the criminal over her own safety and dignity.

&gt;Still a higher rate than the EU. 

What does police shooting criminals have to do with the legality of civilians owning firearms?

&gt;Unarmed community policing has shown a lot of promise in various countries. 

Then sign up to be an unarmed guard. Better yet, just walk into those crime-ridden communities and volunteer your services.

&gt;Very few people manage to murder others by throwing tiny packets of coke at them.

People don't get ""murdered"" by illegal drugs?! Over 70k people die a year in the US due to illegal drugs, and over 14k with cocaine in their system. And you better believe that drug dealers get prosecuted for homicide on a routine basis. Of course, I don't know how 70k people could die from something that is banned! There should be no deaths at all, as you're claiming that bans work.

&gt;It's easier to get access to firearms illegally if there is an overabundance in a society in the first place.

Ah... so all the drugs in the US are from an overabundance of legal heroin, opium, and coca farms! No way they could get them through the border. Never mind the US, care to explain how full-automatic weapons make it into the hands of drug cartels throughout the world? If you don't know, it's close to impossible for a US civilian to own full-automatic firearms. Do tell.
 
&gt;such as calling the insane rate of police shootings irrelevant

Police shootings ARE irrelevant to any discussion about civilian gun control.

&gt;you are still left with a rate three times that of Germany

Are you comparing apples to oranges again? New Hampshire (the state with the lax gun laws) has the same homicide rate of Germany. Clearly it's not the guns that correlate to homicides.

4900,"Firstly, let me preface this by apologizing as I will not be able to post online sources due to the scarcity of digital information concerning the subject. The best I can do is link the same [three photos](https://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/do/search/?q=baltic&amp;start=0&amp;context=3219007&amp;facet=) from Louisiana State University that refer to the guards in black dress and blue helmets (distinct from the olive-brown US uniforms) as ""Baltic guards"".

It has also been some time since I buried myself in this material and I only have some notes from that time to go on, hence I might be a bit iffy on some of the details. I understand that you might decide to not believe me, but I can't do any better than this at the moment. 

Anyway, here goes.

First of all - *there were no Latvian or any other Baltic guards in the Nurnberg Justice Palace during the International Military Tribunal from 1945 to October of 1946.*

The first two experimental Baltic guard units (one Latvian and one Estonian) were created in May of 1946 under the Labor Service of the US Army. They wore black uniforms with Latvian/Estonian colors and blue helmets with the flag of the respective country (though the helmets weren't painted until a bit later). This was possible due to the ruling by the International Military Tribunal that, due to the overt majority of involuntary conscripts, exempted the Latvian and Estonian SS divisions from the tribunals declaration that named the Waffen SS as a criminal organization.

Each unit composed 15 men and an officer, and were drawn from the refugees at the Maerzfeld refugee camp in Nurnberg. The two units started guard duties in the city of Nurnberg at the end of June, 1946.

In December of 1946 the experimental units were deemed a success and General McCarney signed off on creating larger units of the from the ranks of the Baltic refugees.

They were organized as part of the Labor Service of the US army, and the first Latvian company was sworn in on the 17. January as the US Army's 8920nd Labor Service Company ""Viestura rota"".  It was built upon the core of the existing 16 strong unit from 1946 and was composed of 8 officers and near 300 enlisted (for lack of a better word) and garrisoned several locations in and around Nurnberg, the exact names of the places, unfortunately, escape me.

From spring of 1947 the company provided security and guard duty in the Justice Palace of Nuremberg for the remaining Nazi war criminals. At this point the Baltic guards were used for most of the escort and guard duties in the prison block.
They did not escort the criminals in the courtroom itself or in the execution area - the Americans took that role.

Later on in 1948 the company was moved to Stuttgart in order to amplify the protection of the US Army Corps HQ there.

tl;dr Latvian guards did guard Nazi war criminals in Nurnberg, but only from 1947 when the ""top 24 nazis"" had been tried, sentenced and (mostly) executed.

Before Europe was liberated, the Allies had to invade the continent, killing hundreds of thousands of people. And spoiler alert, they weren't all Nazis.

It's unfortunate for the people of Poland that they were effectively annexed by the USSR, but that does nothing to change the fact that at the end of the day there was a line drawn in the sand and they were on the wrong side. There were hundreds of thousands of soldiers from Russia, and hundreds of thousands more from the occupied states who were willing to fight on Russia's behalf.

Even if we accept the false claim that everyone in the Warsaw Pact aside from Russia was an innocent victim that provided no strategic value to the Soviets at face value, you *still* can't ignore the fact that there were massive troop buildups in the occupied Eastern and Central European territories. Troops that the Western allies did not have the conventional power to stop.

So in the event of a war in 1956, the West only had 3 options.

4935,"&gt;The country received £56bn in development funds between 2007 and 2013, money that was used to build hundreds of kilometres of highways and express roads as well as youth sports facilities, modern sewerage systems, kindergartens and pre-schools.

&gt;Add to that the £60bn earmarked for Warsaw in the EU's 2014-20 budget and the country will have enjoyed a windfall equivalent to roughly double the value of the Marshall Plan, calculated in today's dollar figures. And that does not take into account the tens of billions of pounds that Polish farmers continue to receive in agricultural subsidies from Brussels. What we are witnessing is, without doubt, one of the largest wealth transfers between nations in modern history.

&gt;Then there is the boost the Polish economy has enjoyed thanks to its booming exports, which mostly head to other EU countries. A year before accession, Poland generated an annual GDP of £130bn; by 2013, that figure had grown to £305bn. Meanwhile, GDP per capita has risen from 44% of the EU average on accession to 67% today and is forecast to reach 74% by 2020. Small wonder then that some nine out of 10 Poles support their country's membership of the EU, according to a survey last month.

&gt;But it is not just Poland's economy that has changed; it's the country's citizens as well. Young Poles today travel and study all over Europe, taking part in exchange programmes or just simply packing up their bags and heading for the nearest airport. Many have now personally interacted with folk from different countries and races or know people from their families who have. This was not always the case.

4971,"AI/ML will definately lead to a significant number of false alarms, e.g., if you use public domain materials also used in copyrighted material, leading again to the argument I presented in my first reply to you (i.e., its use will delay and hinder indie companies and individual free speech). It can also be circumvented by the application of filters that fool the ML algorithm while allowing human ""readability"" and which may be somewhat complex to create, but are simple to wrap in a program and freely distribute (but of course, effectively countering this would be beyond what is asked of companies such as Youtube).

We're not dealing with a dichotomy here in which it's either filtering or no copyright protection at all. Two alternatives that quickly came to mind: 1) copyright holders/associations are the ones in charge of finding and providing evidence of copyright violations (with people considered innocent and no content removed until proof is provided), 2) as happens with illegal torrents in Germany, private individuals can flag and ""extort"" (ask the user to take the content down and pay a fee or else get faced with a lawsuit) copyright violators, for personal gain. In these two options, only those users which have indeed commited copyright violations are punished, and in the last option, neither the copyright holder nor the content sharing platform need to pocket the expense, the offender does (and you give the Average Joe a motivation to fight copyright violations).

Finally, I again think your examples are a bit off. No one is arguing that companies in general should be able to ignore copyright or avoid industry regulations. We're talking about platforms that allow users to upload content and in so doing may or may not violate certain laws. It would be like Amazon implementing a filter which would not allow the selling of counterfeits, but would probably end up also blocking all lawful resales of a lawfully obtained product. It's definately fine if Amazon decides that's how they want to run their business, but I'm not sure it would be ok that the law forces Amazon, and every other website, to do so.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/9yrbgb/so_this_happened_on_my_reddit_today_and_it/ea58y8t/,OnThatNote101,1542771286

* [The populism backlash: An economically driven backlash](https://voxeu.org/article/populism-backlash-economically-driven-backlash) (May 2018)

&gt; There has been some disagreement over the roots of the recent rise of populism in Europe. This column examines variations in exposure to economic shocks and in ability to react to them in different regions of Europe to show that the cultural backlash against globalisation has been driven by economic woes. In regions where globalisation was present but that have benefited economically, there has been no such backlash and the populist message has retreated. The message is clear: if one wants to defeat populism, one must defeat first economic insecurity.

* [Populism and trust in Europe](https://voxeu.org/article/populism-and-trust-europe) (August 2017)

&gt; Recent years have seen a decline in trust in established political institutions and parties and a surge in support for populist movements and policies, not least in Europe where scepticism and, in some places, outright hostility towards the European Union is evident. This column introduces the first report in CEPR’s Monitoring International Integration series, which analyses the roots of the decline in trust in both national and European political institutions and asks whether, as a result of these developments, the EU is at risk of disintegration.

* [The European trust crisis and the rise of populism](https://voxeu.org/article/european-trust-crisis-and-rise-populism) (December 2017)

&gt; A wave of populism has been gaining ground in the West since 2012. This column uses regional data for 26 European countries to explore how the impact of the Great Recession on labour markets has affected populist voting, political attitudes, and trust. The results indicate a strong link between unemployment and voting for non-mainstream (especially populist) parties. Unemployment is also correlated with increasing distrust of national and European parliaments.

* [The rise of populism and the collapse of the left-right paradigm: Lessons from the 2017 French presidential election](https://voxeu.org/article/rise-populism-and-collapse-left-right-paradigm) (September 2018)

&gt; The 2017 French presidential election is but one example of the move away from the traditional left-right political axis. This column argues that subjective variables are key to understanding this shift. Votes on the traditional left-right axis are correlated with views on redistribution and predicted by socioeconomic variables such as income and social status. Votes in the 2017 election in France, however, appear to have been driven by individual and subjective variables, with low well-being associated with ‘anti-system’ opinions (on the left or the right) and low interpersonal trust associated with right-wing populism.

* [The spread of populism in Western countries](https://voxeu.org/article/spread-populism-western-countries) (October 2017)

&gt; Populism – on both the left and right – has recently become a powerful force in western politics. This column uses individual data on political attitudes to argue that economic drivers are the most important factors influencing the demand for, and supply of, populist parties. Recent data also show that as these parties gain support, their political rivals adapt to embrace populism.",,/r/europe/comments/9yzibr/the_new_populism_an_investigation_into_the_rise/ea594ii/,envatted_love,1542771471

&gt;In contrast Mexico has 4x the murder rate of the USA despite having much more extensive gun control laws than the states do.

&gt;Blaming everything on guns is a reductionist deflection away from less PC reasons for why a society may take a turn towards violence

Europe has more migrants, more cultures, and is actually a bunch of countries. So why is the average homicide rate so low? They have like 10x the reasons to kill each other.

Mexico has 4x the murder rate *because half the country is basically owned by guns* (same with like 1/2 s SA) 

As countries get more developed, the crime rate goes down. 

.

&gt;Tokyo for example does not have the same levels of violent crime as London, despite having similar levels of gun control.

Yes, but have you seen the standard of living in Tokyo? 

&gt;Yeah but you're cherry picking here. By and large ""deep red"" gun owning America is decidedly not where America's massive violent crime numbers come from (which again, if we're being honest derives mainly from urban centers, especially heavily Black/Hispanic ones).

Erm... Texas?

&gt;This doesn't change the observation that clearly some of the strictest gun control in Europe has not been a barrier against violence happening that city. A murder can be committed with a knife almost as easily as it can be with a gun, and ofc the citizens of London have no means to defend themselves against knife wielding attackers because guns are banned.

You people seriously think you can wound as many people with a knife instead of a gun? 

Let's say you have a gun, and you want to kill as many people as possible. Simple. Just fire off as many rounds into a crowd as possible. It's a simple numbers game.

Now let's review the same situation with a knife. You're going to get 1, he is going to scream out (you just stabbed him lol) and maybe you get 1 or 2 more in the next 10s of commotion.

Which do you think is more likely to have more casualties?

Stopping a murderer with a knife is so much easidr than a gun, simply because a knife isn't a ranged weapon.

&gt;The easy way to test that would be to look at crime figures for destitute whites vs destitution blacks and compare. Have you?

While doing that you would also have to look at how poor and crime ridden the place is where they're living (crime encourages more crime)

&gt;Yeah but you're cherry picking here. By and large ""deep red""

I think the overall outcome of what happened in Ukraine would be a lot better weren't it for the American government, their multinationals and interest of them. Most of Europe their problems with Russia are due to the position Europe has in regards to United States. 

The thread of USA economic power and rising China is more severe and much more dangerous than Russia. US is rather obvious, it has been actively using Europe for the last ~75 years. It's an economic super power on par with the economic power of the EU as a whole. It's expanding its cultural norms and values actively across Europe, it's very hard to oppose American interest overall. They have many military bases which a demagogue such as Trump calls ''military aid'', as if making European countries vassals means aiding European interest.

 As for China it's an authoritarian regime that's growing rapidly economically speaking. It actively seeks to expand its influence and will which is seen in the south Chinese sea and in African countries. China will be a very big threat to Europe in the long term. The ideologies are also entirely different from European countries and China, while European law guarantees a wide range of human rights this isn't the case in China.

Of course they don't. But they will generally still calculate with that risk in mind. More weapons increase the potential to violence.

&gt;&gt; (from u/Sutartine) Explanation of Vote before the Vote on a Third Committee Resolution on the Glorification of Nazism (Ambassador Kelley Currie, U.S. Mission to the United Nations)

&gt;&gt;We deeply regret this resolution is not designed to actually combat the global threat of modern Nazism, anti-Semitism, and totalitarian ideology. The resolution inappropriately focuses on criminalizing free speech and expression. As in years past, one nation has chosen to hijack this resolution, narrow its scope, and use it as a political weapon against its neighbors. For those reasons, and because it calls for unacceptable limits on the fundamental freedom of expression, the United States must vote against this resolution.

&gt;&gt;We are particularly concerned about the vague terminology that attempts to capture “incitement” or “incitement to discrimination,” which can be and has been used by governments to inappropriately target political opponents and undermine the ability of civil society to shine a light on human rights abuses in their countries.

&gt;&gt;The United States strongly disagrees with the resolution’s willingness to curb freedom of expression. While we share concerns over the rise in hate speech around the globe, this resolution’s recommendations to limit freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to peaceful assembly contravene the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and must be opposed.",,/r/europe/comments/9ytgjc/un_general_assembly_resolution_on_combatting_the/ea4zgdu/,yugo_1,1542761829

5140,"Britain is leading a final attempt to stop an alleged former KGB agent from taking over as the head of Interpol.

Alexander Prokopchuk, a veteran of Russia’s interior ministry, is the favourite to be elected as the next president of the police co-operation body when delegates vote in Dubai tomorrow.

News that he had emerged as the frontrunner was revealed by The Times on Saturday and has prompted frantic efforts by activists and politicians from across the spectrum in the UK, US and Europe to thwart his appointment.

Russia has faced criticism from the west for abusing the agency’s “red notice” system of international arrest warrants to target political opponents. Mr Prokopchuk spent several years as head of the department responsible for issuing Russia’s red notice requests.

Earlier today Britain openly opposed his candidacy for the first time and instead pledged support for the South Korean acting president of Interpol, Kim Jong Yang. Harriett Baldwin, a Foreign Office minister, told MPs that “we always seek to endorse candidates who have a history of observing standards of international behaviour”. She said the UK had a “very good working relationship” with the secretary-general of Interpol, Germany’s Jürgen Stock, who is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation.

Two influential MPs suggested that the UK should consider setting up an alternative to Interpol if Mr Prokopchuk is elected. Tom Tugendhat and Yvette Cooper, who chair the foreign affairs committee and home affairs committee, wrote in an open letter to the government that Mr Prokopchuk’s election would be the “latest nail in Interpol’s coffin”.

They wrote that the leadership change “should prompt a British rethink of the system of international law enforcement co-operation” and called for the UK to work with other countries to “develop a new transnational organisation comprising rights-respecting states”.

Politicians in Lithuania and Ukraine have threatened to pull out of the agency in the event of a Russian victory, while four prominent US senators likened such a scenario to “putting a fox in charge of a henhouse”.

The election of a new Interpol president follows the disappearance of Meng Hongwei who has been detained in China and is under investigation by anti-corruption authorities. The new president will fill the last two years of his term and there are three candidates, Mr Prokopchuk, Mr Jong Yang and a South African nominee, Scott Naidoo.

British officials have previously concluded that Mr Prokopchuk had unstoppable momentum.

Bill Browder, an American financier and prominent Kremlin critic, said that putting a Russian representative “in charge of the most important international crime-fighting organisation is like putting the mafia in charge”.

“If a Russian is president of this organisation this Russian will be acting on the instructions of Vladimir Putin,” he said.

Mr Browder was detained in Spain earlier this year under what he said was a politically motivated red notice. Interpol have said there was no notice issued against him but Spanish police claimed that an expired warrant had been incorrectly left on the system by the policy agency.

Speaking alongside Mr Browder in central London, Ben Emmerson, QC, said that Interpol had an “extremely weak underbelly with no real protection against manipulation and abuse”.

He questioned whether Interpol had “now moved beyond the point from which it can be sensibly reformed and whether democratic nations need to consider the formation of a new organisation so that the shared democratic values of the commitment to the rule of law can be reflected in the organisation’s due process principles”.

Mr Prokopchuk, a 57-year-old major-general, has been one of four Interpol vice-presidents since 2016.

Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian MP, alleged that Mr Prokopchuk was an agent with the KGB’s foreign intelligence unit in the late 1980s, where he was responsible for recruiting students from Europe and the US. He alleged that Mr Prokopchuk worked undercover at the Pushkin State Language Institute. The institute has not commented on the claims.

Mr Gerashchenko also said that Mr Prokopchuk spied on the United States while based in Washington with Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service in the mid-1990s.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9yx5ax/uk_threatens_to_walk_away_from_interpol_if_exkgb/ea4q7dn/,middlemanmark,1542753172

The fact that most hate speech laws were poorly implemented and that progressive ideals are frequently used as dirty political tools stems from the corruption of our political systems, not from an inherent flaw of these ideals and values.

5165,"You misunderstand my argument. I am saying that if a platform can not moderate its content because the volume is too high, that is on them to solve. It should not be a reason to just look the other way and not demand they fix things.

If YouTube, Facebook, Twitter can not deal with the amount of content going on their platforms, then they should reconsider their approach and service, not hide behind the argument that it is too difficult.

YouTube should pay for it because it is their service. Who else would pay for it? They want to run a certain business, that comes with costs and risks. That is the nature of running a company. Why should Amazon pay for delivering packages, why should Netflix for licensing movies, why should BMW for testing their cars. Because that is part of their business. 

Next to that, not so long ago these same parties argued they could fix all those things by magical A.I. Now that regulation is being looked at, it is suddenly impossible? So they were just lying then, as has become usual.

The regulation also doesn't ask for it all to be perfect. It asks for proportionate and appropriate measures, which can easily be argued to allow a certain margin of error. ",,/r/europe/comments/9yrbgb/so_this_happened_on_my_reddit_today_and_it/ea4qiqv/,cissoniuss,1542753441

5170,"Ah, but we're only talking about the time where all of the other terrorists groups had been caught and dismantled and the islamists were alone ! I thought we were talking about ""in general"", I mean, it's not like Muslims or immigrants had a blood moon and went from cute to deadly around the 90s, but fine, let's look at the numbers from 1995 to 2015 (because the article I've linked only gives stats up until 2015) :

&amp;#x200B;

\- Number of people killed during that period : 23 356

\- Islamic terrorist attacks : 14 attacks, 174 killed (not including suspects), they represent 0.74% of murders during that period, 6 attacks, 95 killed since

(as a note, only three attacks went over 10 killed, the attacks of Charlie Hebdo, 14, Nice, 87 and the Bataclan, 137, these three represent more than 88% of the death caused by Islamic terrorism since 1995)

\- Homicides during  ""settling of accounts"" between 2000 and 2018 : 1 694 (source : ministry of the interior), more than nine times the number of death cause by Islamic terrorists and let me remind you, organized crime was on my list of ""terrorism that isn't Islamic"" so it counts

&amp;#x200B;

For the rest : all far-left terrorism is gone, the closest thing are people breaking MacDonalds during marches and vegans breaking into farms to free the little chickens, far-right terrorism is supposed to be gone even thought the police just stopped a plan to kill the President that was made by far-right people, Basque terrorism is gone, the ETA dismantled themselves multiple time, they have killed 829 people during their 59 years of existence, mostly in Spain thought, Corsican terrorism is thought to be gone, but they didn't usually killed people, they're more the kind to blow up the house of any non-Corsican who wants to live there, so it hasn't really stopped, it's just rarer. That's only the situation in France though, we can't forget people like Breivik in Norway or the ""every day a new mass murder"" that's going on in the US with a tiny minority of them being done by Islamic terrorist.

&amp;#x200B;

And for future stat, we have a problem : if they aren't Islamist, they aren't called terrorists, they're called ""crazy people"" or things like that. Even when they kill in the name of an ideology, if they're white, the French media (and by extension, I expect, French stats institutes) won't talk about terrorism, that term is now only reserved to black people killing in the name of Islam, so of course, from now on, statistics of terrorism will have a strong bias.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and anti-semitic murders ? The majority of them are done by far-right people, not by Muslim immigrants (source : former prime minister De Villepin), are mostly caused by the Israel-Palestine conflict (source : a 2014 study relayed by \[Le Monde Diplomatique\]([https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/carnet/2015-04-17-Racisme-antisemitisme](https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/carnet/2015-04-17-Racisme-antisemitisme)), article in French). All studies shows that the origin of someone has no impact on their point of view of jews, so, if we don't have any data backing up the idea that Muslims and / or immigrants are more violent, if we have data showing they aren't more hateful, the conclusion can only be : there's no reason to believe that they commit more anti-semitic murders than the rest of the population.

&gt;You do realise that with marionette at the helm of Interpol they can literally imprison people who have escaped from Russia like journalists and dissidents?

That is manifestly untrue. Quoting the Wikipedia: *Contrary to frequent portrayals in popular culture, Interpol is not a supranational law enforcement agency and has no agents who are allowed to make arrests.*

Any arrests stemming from the Interpol notices are enacted by the national police of the participating countries.

5322,"&gt;In 2012, I succeeded in advocating for the U.S. government to pass the Magnitsky Act, named after my colleague Sergei Magnitsky, who was imprisoned by Russian authorities after exposing high-level corruption, and who died in detention after being beaten and denied medical care. This law allows the United States to freeze the assets and ban visas for Russian human rights abusers. Since then, Russian President Vladimir Putin has embarked on a vendetta against me. This has taken a number of forms, including death threats and plans for illegal renditions. But one of the most pernicious has been Moscow’s repeated attempts to misuse Interpol to try to have me arrested and extradited back to Russia, where they will likely torture and kill me.

While most countries / their populations are attacked in specific threads / during specific times when it comes to e.g. Russians or Turks this tends to be more widespread than the average in my perception.

 Attacking Russia the country, just like any other country, is fine in general unless covered by other rules.

5343,"I think many political leaders of all era's are pragmatists-there is what they really desire, and what is possible. Irish culture has been losing so long, and living under the Anglo-sphere so long that the will of the people was swept away to make way for what England and her colonial cohorts in Ireland wanted. Those few natives left in power found themselves shoved into the English, then British ""stream"" or system if they wanted to keep hold of what they had. Take the O' Brien clan, for instance, they were so determined to keep power they ended up completely assimilating, the head of the O' Brien clan is now an Eton educated, ex British army officer, Sir Conor O' Brien. Conor lives in the republic and they advocate republican principals on the clan website (the same as the power ""stream"" previously mentioned, just converse!). Those bloodlines like the O' Neill's who kept rebelling, are lost to history. 18th century Republicanism then emerged as an egalitarian ideal, led mainly by settler intellectuals from the north. Its a wonder there were as many rebellions as there were given the hold the English had on the country. The Island was almost annexed by British culture (there was no union of crowns in Ireland, our system was obliterated) but thankfully we held out and at least remembered-things can be another way. There have been considerable changes the last 100 years, in the south at least. Looks like the tide is eventually turning up north too. Northern Ireland (and maybe even the U.K.) could be on its last legs. Hopefully I'll get to see the real majority ""unionism"" of the island of Ireland triumph in my lifetime, that is, the union of the north and south of Ireland.

5360,"&gt; It’s interesting how treaties become “obsolete” whenever it is convenient to Britain. 

That's nonsense.  They become obsolete when you sign new treaties that explicitly replace them ... as Spain did with the UN Convention.

I find it amusing that you are at one and the same time arguing that the Treaty of Utrecht is sacrosanct, while also claiming it is an illegitimate British colony, despite the treaty granting it to Britain in perpetuity.  And if you really want to get into treaty interpretation, the Treaty of Utrecht doesn't actually say anything about territorial waters because the concept didn't exist at the time.  You are interpreting a statement restricting the grant to the territory of the castle and town as if that rules out territorial waters.  But that's nonsense as territorial waters were not a recognised concept when the treaty was signed.

&gt;Spain made its position clear 

Spain signed an international treaty that explicitly rules out the possibility of signatories making any exceptions whatsoever.  It then proceeded to try to make an exception.  I guess you can call that making its position clear if you like.  At least it is legally clear that Spain doesn't have a leg to stand on, regardless of what it says on the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What about the airport land that was occupied 

Personally, I think that was probably technically illegitimate under the treaty. As to what was the justification for occupying that land, it was the fact that World War II had started and a fascist dictatorship existed in Spain, necessitating additional defence measures.  I think the measures were reasonable to take at the time but I also think the Gibraltar government should aim to come to an acceptable agreement with Spain on the matter now.

&gt;Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone called the Nuremberg trials a fraud.[75] ""(Chief U.S. prosecutor) Jackson is away conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg, ... I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas"", Stone wrote.[75]

&gt;Jackson, in a letter discussing the weaknesses of the trial, in October 1945 told U.S. President Harry S. Truman that the Allies themselves ""have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it. We say aggressive war is a crime and one of our allies asserts sovereignty over the Baltic States based on no title except conquest.""[76][77]

&gt;Associate Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of ""substituting power for principle"" at Nuremberg. ""I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled,"" he wrote. ""Law was created ex post facto to suit the passion and clamor of the time.""[78]

&gt;U.S. Deputy Chief Counsel Abraham Pomerantz resigned in protest at the low caliber of the judges assigned to try the industrial war criminals such as those at I.G. Farben.[79]

5625,"Wait, that doesn't make sense at all. 

Take a population where women work in lower positions or not at all. There are plenty of reasons but the most prominent being that the man already makes enough money and the woman only has a sidegig for fun or whatever. 

In this index, this population would be last because they don't have as many business school applications or representation in senior jobs. 

Furthermore, if child care costs are high (because child care is so amazing that they literally get gold to eat) and it matches the high income in that region (e.g. Switzerland) then it would also count as bad even though it's good. 

And what about an industry-heavy country where most senior positions are probably held by men?

This seems so backwards. So *2015*. Whether or not it's nice to be a working woman in a country shouldn't depend on what *current* working women do, but what their offers, prospects, chances, confirmed assaults/mobbing/sexism at work and acceptance in society are.

5666,"&gt;I am not fighting against building more renewables. I want nuclear and renewables to both be built, preferrably as fast as possible to replace fossil fuels.

And yet that takes the form of arguing against renewables, because nuclear and renewables compete for a number of resources: investment, legal support, flexible capacity, market access. That claim would be more believable if nuclear energy proponents spent most of their time arguing against fossil fuels, rather than against renewables.

&gt;There are applications where renewables just won't fucking work, but nuclear does. 

Interstellar spaceflight, yes. Long term submarines. Any others?

&gt;Because the green parties are so anti-nuclear, the industries that need stable power can't use nuclear, and they can't use renewables because they aren't sufficient. The only option left is fossil fuels, which is the absolute wost outcome possible. The last paragraph was more of a rant on how this entire eco catastrophy could have been avoided if people weren't so anti-nuclear in the past. They are the reason why we use so much fossil fuels and why we are drowning/choking in crap.

You can get stable power from the grid by a number of means. Again, there were no green parties in the '50s. Nuclear energy was alone with fossil fuels for decades: they had their chance to solve all problems, but they didn't, and unlike renewables, technological advances have ground to a halt. Stop blaming others and instead recognize that nuclear energy has many disadvantages, even before climate change was on the agenda.

It's not really their fault – I received above-average education (8-year *gymnázium*, college) and I learnt **nothing** about managing personal finances, loans, how it all works. And I was lucky to grow up in a fairly standard middle class family, so I didn't start out with my parents' debt when I turned 18 like many in the poor families do. People who receive bad education, have zero support from their family (only liabilities) and were never properly educated about how to make ends meet will *inevitably* fall prey to loan sharks, scam, or simple stupidity based on a lack of foresight – just look at how many *borrow* money to go on holiday; does that seem smart to you? It doesn't to me, but to people who don't see beyond the next pay check, it might seem like a good enough deal. And then they lose their job, get into trouble, are unable to pay debts, are unaware of ways how to deal with the situation, and then the bailiff is knocking on the door leaving you with an empty flat. And then no-one will hire you because you're registered as a debtor. Getting out of that debt trap requires some sort of understanding of the applicable law and finances, which the most vulnerable groups often lack completely.

I also don't think it's fair to say 'but these energy companies only produce dirty energy because the consumers buy that energy'. Yeah, well, we didn't chose the current system and these companies have had MANY opportunities to make amends and change their ways for the past 50 years, they didn't and our governments willingly ignored all the signs and warnings from the scientific community. 

Individual responsibility is a neoliberal myth designed to make us feel individually guilty in the face of such an enormous problem, which results in little change and actions like yesterday (two good things for big oil) while ignoring the inevitable system change we've been avoiding since the 1950's. In the meantime, our government spokepersons are on TV saying 'just ditch your car to buy electric if you're unhappy'.

I don't think the burden to pay for climate change related costs should be distributed evenly on every one.

What is fuzzy about this is that we know ratio of how many people did it for what reason, I mean people will judge differently people who did this because of anti-semitic reasons or greed then people  who did this survive even Jewish people excuse fellow jews who collaborated with nazi to survive.

While you do have a point about where most extermination taken place. the problem is when you extrapolate this to rest of country.

To be honest some people have problem with research like this because there are israeli news sites that are purposly trying to paint different image about poland, for example I saw Israeli news site sometime ago purposly misquoting research of Grabowski to make poland look worse then it was, they quoted him saying that Polish people are responsible for directly and indirectly killing 200,000 jews, problem is that the news site removed the part about indirectly, so they quoted him as saying that polish people are responsible for **directly** killing 200,000 jews...
I dont get why some people in Israel want to make poland look as bad as possible...

I do agree with rest of what you are saying, I would even support more research to have more evidence so people who deny it couldnt escape from truth but it would be best if research like this was done by larger group of people so no one could manipulate data, since some polish people are denying it I wouldnt trust polish people alone to do research because of bias(and I am saying it polish person) but I also wouldnt trust people like Grabowski who did some of his research in questionable way, or some people from israel alone, since they also shown their bias, but if we gathered people  from both sides to watch each other hands maybe then we could have proper unbiased research.",,/r/europe/comments/9yfqxi/holocaust_researcher_files_libel_lawsuit_against/ea3drh0/,Culaio,1542709648

5744,"&gt;""**The vast majority of Scots voted against leaving the EU. Her head of government is fiercely critical of Prime Minister May, and could now once again seek independence from Britain.**

&gt;*By Cathrin Kahlweit*

&gt;The Scottish Prime Minister does not appear to be at the center of the current dispute over the Brexit Treaty, which London and Brussels have now submitted. And yet she is a central figure - and it gets more with each passing day. First-minister Nicola Sturgeon had tried to talk to British Prime Minister Theresa May before the Cabinet presentation of the deal with the EU, but she was out of the question. Disrespecting them, Sturgeon said angrily. On Thursday, she was able to speak with May - but at a time when this was due to the surprising resignation of two ministers and two secretaries of state had other things to do than to debate the contract with the Scottish colleague.

&gt;It is - also - the votes of the Scots that May needs in a few weeks to get the deal through the parliament. And it's Nicola Sturgeon, the head of the autonomous government in Edinburgh, who as a vehement opponent of the Brexit now makes mood against what May has presented. ""Have recently finished the phone conversation with the Prime Minister,"" tweeted Sturgeon outraged. ""She was trying to tell me that Scotland's interests were protected by the deal, and I pointed out that Scotland does not speak up, that our interests are disregarded, and that Scotland now has a decisive competitive disadvantage.""

&gt;What the politician and lawyer most popular with her compatriots aims at is the comparison with Northern Ireland, which had been a dominant topic because of the border issue during the Brexit negotiations. Like the Northern Irish, most of the Scots voted against Brexit, as many Northern Irish, many Scots want independence from London - even more so now that Brexit is leading them out of EU membership, which has brought them many advantages.

&gt;For the time being, Northern Ireland will remain in the Customs Union and the Internal Market under the present draft Treaty, thereby presumably having trading advantages over other parts of the Kingdom. In the future, the Scots would have to compete for investments and jobs with the Northern Irish, rages Sturgeon, that is ""the worst of all possible variants"".

&gt;The Scots demanded special conditions similar to those of the Northern Irish, she said, to cushion the consequences of Brexit.

&gt;According to current calculations, which are not particularly resilient, May has no majority for their contract in Westminster. So she would do well to woo the members of Sturgeon's SNP, the Scottish National Party. But May currently has no offer for her, which should turn the No into a Yes.

&gt;Into politics, to stop Thatcher's policy Nicola Sturgeon will know how to use that. The 48-year-old is a fighter. She jogs a lot, is slim and dynamic, calls herself a feminist and pacifist. At the age of 16, she joined the SNP to stop Margaret Thatcher's conservative policies. The austerity policy of the current Tory government in London vehemently rejected her. The 2014 independence referendum in Scotland, sponsored by Sturgeon, then Minister of Transport, ended with a terse no. But Sturgeon, who took over the office of First Minister after the campaign, presented in 2016 a draft bill for a second referendum.

&gt;Since it was unpredictable for a long time whether the result would be different this time, Sturgeon had recently stressed that the new referendum would take place when circumstances changed. Now that the Brexit deal has been settled, which was rejected in Scotland with a whopping 62 to 38 percent, these changed circumstances may have occurred. Anyway, Sturgeon is determined to make the most of a Brexit she considers ""irresponsible.""

5751,"&gt;are they really more likely to pick Finland over the US?

No, but that is a bad example and doesn't mean anything. First of all, the US is many times larger than Finland (approx. 59 times the population). The fair question would be whether there are more Chinese talents *per capita* in Finland than in the US.

Is the probability of a Chinese talent looking to work abroad less than 59 times more likely to pick the US over Finland? That already seems much more reasonable. But on top of that, there is another effect: China is not the only country in the world with talented people, and the population of talented people of a specific country might behave differently from the complete set of talented people overall.

Therefore, even if a Chinese talent looking to work abroad is over 59 times more likely to pick the US over Finland, then still it can be the case that Finland is more successful at attracting foreign talent than the US, as long as there talented people from other countries are proportionally more likely to chose Finland over the US.

My guess is that there is a lot of exchange of talent between the European states, while way fewer talented people of Europe move to the US.",,/r/europe/comments/9ypxeh/these_countries_are_best_in_the_world_at/ea3dxss/,TaXxER,1542709991

Those are different cases, if you presume to know the context, you should investigate further. The Hermitage Capital Management case is from presumed crimes committed in 2007. While Bill Browder case begins years before, however because of how bad it would look like for foreign investors to jail someone like him, he was just denied further stay in Russia (his visa canceled), that was in 2005.

Given the nature of his business and significant loopholes in Russian law back then, it is very unlikely that his fund didn't tax evade. Those loopholes allowed to tax evade through the tax havens, however didn't absolve from criminal responsibility.

That is the corner stone of Putin's regime, because of capitalist rationale, almost all businessmen can be held responsible for tax fraud. While all the public servants on relevant positions can be prosecuted for corruption.

In case of Browder, there was not initial political motivation, like against Khodorkovsky. But after he was basically denied entry to Russia, he started a scandal about it (probably thinking that he could leverage it to make it all go his way) and then it started to be political.

And in the 2013 we had a sentence in absentia for 9 years against Browder. The sentence is for his actions in 1999-2004 period. Which confirms what I told you before, about his ""exposing corruption"" started after the criminal case. The only mistake the prosecution did, is that they decided to let him go (for political reasons) and then restarted the case (again for political reasons).

Regarding the evidence, the case in particular accused him of using strawpeople to submit his funds to Russian regulation for Russian citizens, and avoid Russian regulation for foreign citizens and non-residents. 

If the accusations have been falsified, he could have addressed them on his homepage. Similar how Khodorkovsky did (the problem being, Khodorkovsky didn't think people would read 500+ pages sentence and call him up his bullshit).

Instead Browder started to ""*expose corruption*"" and claim that he is being prosecuted for political reasons. Which is funny, because it's **true**. However hadn't he started to stir shit up, he wouldn't be prosecuted, again for political reasons (because that would be bad publicity for Russian markets). But since he already did the damage, then all the cases against his actions restarted.

5799,"&gt;it makes a big difference though if you're just moving around within the same country or if you actually move to another one

Yes, but I would argue that the degree to which it matters is proportional to the size of the country. If you are living in a small country then there is likely to be a much higher ratio of the population living close to a border. Moving just 50 km's to the other side of a border still allows you to regularly keep seeing your family and your old friends frequently, therefore it impacts your life to a lesser degree then moving thousands of kilometers away.

Someone who is moving for thousands of kilometers within the US might actually have his life impacted to a larger degree than someone moving 50 kilometers from the Netherlands to Germany.

5828,"&gt;Of course, but worse off is still worse off.

I don't believe it would be worse off at all.

&gt;I hope you're talking about exports to countries outside of the eurozone, because trade inside the eurozone has no real effect on it.

Both exports to EU countries in general and to the eurozone members went down. This is lost money, how that is irrelevant to you I don't understand. The worth of all German exports has been constantly rising since long before the Euro, so there's no correlation either.

&gt;Most of the problems with being tied to the euro come from situations like Greece, where they had to take a bad deal because they used the euro. If they had been in control of their own currency then they could've simply devalued it and avoided a lot of problems. But something like that can't be blamed on Germany.

The Greek crisis was completely the fault of previous Greek governments handling their finances absolutely awful. Devaluation of a currency comes with a new set of problems, like inflation.

5850,"&gt;The information on financial literacy is based on questions added to the Gallup World Poll survey. 
More than 150,000 nationally representative and randomly selected adults in more than 140 economies were interviewed during the 2014 calendar year. The surveys were conducted face-to-
face in economies where less than 80 percent of the population has access to a telephone or is the customary methodology. The target population consists of the entire population aged 15 and above, 
aside from prisoners and soldiers. 

&gt;*Financial literacy was measured using questions assessing basic knowledge of four fundamental concepts in financial decision-making:* **knowledge of interest rates, interest compounding, inflation, and risk diversification.**

&gt;A person is defined as financially literate when he or she correctly answers at least three out 
of the four financial concepts described above. We choose this definition because the concepts 
are basic and this is what would correspond to a passing grade. Based on this definition, 33 
percent of adults worldwide are financially literate. This means that around 3.5 billion adults 
globally, most of them in developing economies, lack an understanding of basic financial 
concepts.

Your comments make it clear that you believe the white supremacist myth that white people are being killed off in South Africa, you are so racist that you can't distinguish between fiction and reality. The myth that Blacks are killing off South African whites is rooted in apartheid propaganda and spread by neo-nazi subculture.

The Boers have no right to keep the land because it's loot gained during dictatorship at the expense of the majority; the fact that you think they have a right to keep that land only confirm you think apartheid was legitimate and just. The only racism here is your own, since you've made it clear that you admire apartheid. Also race has little to do with my position; the point is that there is no right to retain wealth acquired during dictatorship and that a minority shouldn't be allowed to horde land at the expense of the majority.

5950,"The point is not to discipline workers, the point is to be more competitve with other non-eu countries.

We have a global economic competition now, one where 7 billion people competd globally in producing goods and services.

40 years ago the competition in Europe was mostly local.

The increase in labor supply pushes wages down.

Economic growth cannot be infinite, there are serious physical constraints.

European businesses also have to deal with the pension problem: an ever increasing number of people that are eligible for pensions means very high insurance taxes for European businesses.

Wages in specialized areas of economy that Europe does not have much competition in are still very high.

Also, we must take into account the stupidity of Europe's South that is stuck to a past that is no longer viable, which causes governments to exchange votes for money and to borrow money that can't repay back.

&gt;In fact, German exports to other European countries actually went down since the Euro.

I hope you're talking about exports to countries outside of the eurozone, because trade inside the eurozone has no real effect on it.

&gt;It's more the weak economies getting hurt instead of the rich economies profiting that's the problem in my opinion.

Well, Germany is definitely better off due to this trade imbalance that exists in the eurozone and other countries are worse off compared to where they could be without this trade imbalance, but that doesn't mean those other countries still aren't better off. They're just slightly less better off.

Most of the problems with being tied to the euro come from situations like Greece, where they had to take a bad deal because they used the euro.
