4,"&gt; How about kids who want it? Why does society get to intervene when there is virtually no long-term harm (unlike say a sexually abuse parent) associated with the op?

1) Circumcision can cause long term harm that otherwise could have been avoided. 


2) What else should we allow kids to decide on? Maybe they should always eat candy for diner? I am sure we would get consensus from kids on this issue...  Also circumcision usually happens to babies, how will they decide? 

&gt; What gives you the right?

3)  Child protection. Just because a parent wants to do stuff to kids that potentially could fuck up their lives doesn't mean they should. Circumcision is a medical operation and it should be up to a doctor to decide if the kid needs it and not some nut job parent that has odd religious beliefs. What if I have a religious belief that tells me to punch iditios? Should I have the right to do it if I decide that another person is idiot?

5,"Yes I know the litterature on seretones levels etc. What people really don't like is status inequality. Seeing any kind of earned monetary inequality as unjust is a materalistic viewpoint. There are more important things in life. 

That said, many people could do an even bigger improvement in those issues by simply exercising more. Yet we see no mandatory exercise parties around. 

Monkeys still lives in hierarchies, they just don't have much wealth. I think people take food inequality more serious than monetary inequality for obvious reasons.

I don't see how it is any worse than before in history. People have never been more equal, if you don't count hunter gatherer societies. You also forget that people are far more than monkeys. We care about a much more nuanced set of goals.

82,"&gt; 1) Circumcision can cause long term harm that otherwise could have been avoided.

As can crossing the street. With risks so minuscule, raising avoidance as an argument is disingenuous. This also is not related to children or adults choosing to do something and society intervening. Are you suggesting that adults shouldn't be allowed to do it either?

&gt; 2) What else should we allow kids to decide on? Maybe they should always eat candy for diner? I am sure we would get consensus from kids on this issue... Also circumcision usually happens to babies, how will they decide?

At present I don't think there's any legislation preventing parents from feeding their kids candy as long as they don't end up malnourished to the point of abuse. Are you suggesting that what food kids are fed by their parents should be regulated by the government?

&gt; 3) Child protection. Just because a parent wants to do stuff to kids that potentially could fuck up their lives doesn't mean they should.

It doesn't mean society should intervene either. Parents at present can fuck up their kids just fine. Do you think that hating gays (and consequently imprinting this belief on their children) should be illegal for example? Or if children are taught that circumcision is a good thing are likely to do it at the age of 18, why are you happy with forcing them to take on this extra risk?

&gt; Circumcision is a medical operation and it should be up to a doctor to decide if the kid needs it.

This is not the only thing that it is. You could consider piercings a medical operation too. Want piercings to a choice left up to doctors?

&gt; and not some nut job parent that has odd religious beliefs.

Do you think that for example, religious indoctrination should be banned? It causes way more harm than stuff like circumcision ever could yet last time I checked nobody bans teaching kids religious stuff.

To be fair to Italy, its hardly only Italian issue. Germany in 2016/7 rejected asylum to over 400 thousand migrants. It deported at the same time 40 thousand. For comparision, [Turkey deported in last 6 weeks 6846 Afghans](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/6-846-undocumented-afghan-migrants-deported-from-turkey-in-recent-weeks-130428). None of them voluntary, as Germany does.

So I wonder. Turkey manages to get in 6 weeks deportation rate that Germany with its massive backlog and giant finances manages on average every 4 months. Something must be wrong and that something needs to be addressed. Perhaps this gov will trigger continent in action in this field.

Example 2: There are currently around 100 thousand illegal Bangladeshi residing in Europe. Bangladesh is war-free zone. But Bangladesh has been bit of a cunt and refusing to issue return papers. So what did Europe do? It signed a deal with Bangladesh about deportations. So far so good. In that deal we said Europe, as a whole, will deport AT MAX 500 persons a year.

&gt;Sweden reminds North Korea twice every year about its 43-year-old debt to the publicly-funded Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN), a government agency serving as credit insurer for company’s trade deals.
&gt;
&gt;Back in 1974 North Korea began importing equipment from Western industrialized countries to expand its access to foreign capital and technology. The country promised to pay their creditors either with future production or mining products, but it soon became clear the regime had no intention of honouring its debts.
&gt;
&gt;An original order of 1,000 Volvo 144 model and other mechanical equipment from Swedish companies worth the equivalent of $73 million has been left unpaid and over the last four decades has quadrupled to around $330 million.
&gt;
&gt; North Korea is the biggest debtor to the Swedish agency, as the EKN end of year 2016 report show. EKN says it has has agreements with all 13 countries that have outstanding claims, with the exception of Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
No doubt there is untapped human capital there.  North Korea's issues aren't primarily with a lack of unused human potential, though.

North Korea's issues aren't simply lack of access to capital for development.

Other grammatical differences are very minor.



What changes a lot is the accent, Brazilians especially need some time to understand the Portuguese accent but even that takes at the extreme most a month to get used to.

389,"&gt;  Our companies literally blackmailed our governments with the threat of moving their production.

TIL, thanks, nobody has brought up this perspective before.

&gt; It was the consumer that went straight for Western goods after the Iron Curtain fell. Understandable, but also shortsighted

You can't imagine the Western fetish here in the 90s and maybe early 2000s too. Everything from the West was good and right, we bought products, copied music, reality TV while bashing and always labelling our own things as inferior, without discrimination.

I am pretty sure that one of the reasons why the East-West debate can get so heated is that we idealized the West, imagined a heavenly place where everything is good, everybody is rich, healthy and happy and we strived to join you - that was a, if not *the* main motivation for joining the EU as well. Then everybody realized that it is not true and we are very far even from your not-ideal state as well which hit everybody very hard in the face.

&gt; There was no need for a western company to actively do something to bankrupt an eastern ""competitor"", it just happened naturally. 

Yes. Well, as naturally as natural capitalism is.

&gt;  And why would a company modernize another one as long as its own production facilities are sufficient? Doesn't make sense.

Why would company W buy company E if all it plans to do with it is to fire everybody and close it? Rhetorical question, the answer is obviously: to buy market share.

&gt; It's also the consumer that now buys the inferior product. Don't buy it. You don't need nutella in your life, it is not essential. Restraint is your remedy, western consumers also had to learn this.

I've actually given a lot of thought to this issue when I saw poor families with worn clothes, bad health and generally depressing look buying sweets, snacks and alcohol. Why? My short answer is that when they have little hope for having a better life they choose instant gratification. They don't expect tomorrow to offer more opportunities so they decide not to care. It's easier to buy snacks and unhealthy shit with high sugar/saturated fat content and alcohol for X price in the closest suparmarket than to cook for yourself, go out of your way to find the best quality products and actually plan for long-term so that over time your efforts bear fruit. It's only today they care about: getting drunk today, eating today, spending today's money etc.

&gt; Because, the battle for higher food quality is also going on in the West, and has been going on for much longer than in the East. But of course that's out of sight, so it must be only the Easterners struggling against the evil, racist West.

In the West most people have the disposable income so they can be picky about what to buy. The median income in Hungary is €716 and the prices of eveyday products are about the same or more than in Germany. I was actually very surprised that I could buy my smoked salmon, avocado, tomato and mineral water for about 35% less in Germany compared to Hungary. The vodka I could buy for my Polish flatmate was €5 (the cheapest), here it is €9.3. I don't remember the price but when we compared omega 3 supplements with my dad, you could get the same stuff for 3 times the price in Hungary compared to the Netherlands.

It's difficult to vote with your wallet when you have the choice between having overpriced stuff or no stuff.

&gt; I'm sorry you guys had to go through all the shitty history. But there won't be compensation. Companies won't change their behaviour because they feel sympathetic to your plight.

That's exactly why we all leave. Why would I work 60 hours for €700 to buy expensive stuff when I can work for 40 hours to get €1500 and buy better quality stuff for cheaper price?

&gt; Simply because these practices don't infringe on your rights. There is no right to butter over palm oil, or brown sugar over corn syrup. Don't like it? Don't buy it!

We are kinda forced into buying unhealthy shit because we cannot afford the healthy stuff. Of course it is not a right to have healthy and quality goods with affordable price but I'm pretty sure you understand why are people mad about this.

&gt; Oh, and there also won't be a final victory. This struggle will go on as long as we live in a capitalistic society. 

Sure, capitalism is good as long as it does not have an adverse effect on you. I'm pretty sure that you wouln't want to move into the more capitalistic direction, like no public healthcare, affordable public transport or pension. Even though that would be just as justified as anything you wrote.

393,"*sigh*. I don't equate Palestine to Nazi Germany and I'm aware of the differences. In fact I wrote a little side note saying that they're obviously not the same, but removed it because I thought it was too obvious. Unfortunately I was wrong on that part. I'd say you got a bit too excited there immediately assuming that that's how I view Gaza. It's not, but I do think it's insanity to think that civilians are no longer civilians when they do something their oppressors don't like. Therefore I mentioned a universal and extreme example of humans being stripped of their humanity. And that is what I see you doing. Stripping Palestinians of their humanity and blaming them for provoking their own murders.

Palestinians are locked up with Hamas and they may often depend on Hamas. Infighting isn't going to give them better lives. And understandably Palestinians wouldn't be satisfied even if Hamas wasn't corrupt and spread out the resources fairly. They'd still be living in a cage. Hamas is an excellent scapegoat for Israel though. 

It's interesting how much you praise the country. Even when saying the country isn't perfect, you make it sound like it is. ""We do everything to minimize harm."" That's a blatant falsehood. You say blaming one side keeps us away from a solution, yet it seems like you blame Hamas and Palestinians for Palestinian suffering and you claim that Israel is forced to do what it does. This is manipulation. Say that you empathize with Palestinians and claim that Israel isn't perfect to show some humbleness, yet when reading in between the lines, it's clear you put the blame on Palestinians and you justify Israeli actions. The way you talk is very reminiscent of known Israeli media tactics.

Your situation of 'what would you do' is foolish. Agressors always use some way of saying ""they're coming right for us!"" to justify their actions. There's always some false sense of urgency and danger that makes people go on a rampage, but really war is always preventable and diplomacy is always available.

That's the key thing. Sometimes we can not know for sure, if the evidence isn't enough. So it's down to subjective judgement. And here lies another problem; what is ""enough"" evidence anyway? That's also subjective and is the root cause of the main issue.

That's why someone denying a genocide is their opinion posed as a fact. It's essentially the same thing as politics.

408,"&gt; You say Washington while you have literally US army on your soil. We dont.

That's exactly why I know firsthand where this policy gets you. NATO bases in Germany are used to conduct wars of aggression and commit war crimes in the process; both being illegal under German and international law, by the way. They are used for espionage on German citizens and companies on a colossal scale. Nuclear weapons are stored, maintained and kept ready for deployment on NATO bases in Germany despite the fact that Germany has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear power. 

So much as to what 'international treaties dictate'. 

&gt; And remember this bollocks next time with western security when you cry about ruskies botting the shit out of your facebook during elections.

That's why I'm all for stepping up cyber security efforts within Europe - something the Visegrad states are notably absent, as I recall. I gather that's because Poland and Hungary are too busy censoring the press and gutting the judiciary right now.

Here is a quote from a study on it.

""A 2011 Pew study found that 74% of Muslim Americans ""endorsed the idea that most people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard."" A 2007 Pew survey found that Muslims in America were only 2% more likely to be lower-income than other Americans, while in Europe the numbers were in the double-digits. And most in Europe were more likely to think of themselves as Muslims first compared more than half who saw themselves as American first.""

Again, our laws post-9/11 are nothing but intrusive and unhelpful in this situation, and only served to erode more of our privacy rights. If you want less terrorism your countries will have to find a way to make these populations feel less of a need to commit acts of terror due to social and economic marginalization.

473,"&gt; Selling property and land isn't the only way to get foreign investment.

If selling off a property is bad I wonder what you think about selling off huge tracts of land and giving up sovereignty over them? [Nicaragua managed to scare off the Americans when they were demanding just that.](https://daily.jstor.org/how-a-postage-stamp-may-have-helped-create-the-panama-canal/) Today Panama is 6 times as wealthy as Nicaragua, with the difference in HDI reflecting that fact.

&gt; And if anything letting this air BnB situation go on unregulated is even worse in the long term. Look at London to see where that ends up, with Russian, Saudi and now Chinese oligarchs buying ups houses and keeping prices artificially high while the complicit politicians do little to nothing to resolve the situation. So now the vast majority of people who actually work in London live on the outskirts and are forced to commute an hour each way every day. Not to mention certain parts of the city are now reserved for the ultra rich in general, which fundamentally changes the culture of the city.

Please don't put Britain's housing problems on the Russians and Chinese. In a country where political decisions are in the hands of outrage-driven press, do you expect things to be different? Case in point, the great outrage of a social housing unit not being entirely equipped with sprinklers. Homeless people are wasting away on the streets because nobody in the whole country seems to realize the efforts put into those sprinklers could have gone to more social housing. In Bulgaria sprinklers are a rarity, even in wealthy neighborhoods, and I'm quite confident the deaths from fires here are so much less than deaths from homelessness in the United Kingdom. But of course the deaths of the homeless rarely generate headlines, do they?

Just a personal observation. Examine apartments with and without a license for being rented by multiple people, not in marriage or a familial relationship. The difference in the rent is about a third. And now take into account that this is just one piece of paper and that constructing an apartment building requires many more.

If anything investors are helping solve the problem by seeking a maximum return on their investments. I've not seen any other country with so many people employed in property management. It's like every street has it's own letting agent.

I don't think the celebration was out of place, Marx did highlight a problem that plagued the economical system of the time, and some of his analysis is still relevant today. And while labour unions and worker rights movement existed from before Marx his influence his hard to ignore, and the discussion on the place of the worker in capitalism that he started is surely an influence in our current social democracy

But of course he is mostly connected to communism since, while his analysis was good his idea for the solution was bad and the attempted implementation was goddamn awful. So Marx is associated with socialism, socialism with communism, communism with Lenin, Stalin and Mao and these three weren't particularly pleasant characters (understatement of the century)

&gt;“The cheapest sort of pride is national pride; for if a man is proud of his own nation, it argues that he has no qualities of his own of which he can be proud; otherwise he would not have recourse to those which he shares with so many millions of his fellowmen. The man who is endowed with important personal qualities will be only too ready to see clearly in what respects his own nation falls short, since their failings will be constantly before his eyes. But every miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud adopts, as a last resource, pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and glad to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority.”

If some of the most powerful, rich and well connected women can’t use the law to fight discrimination, then what hope do regular men and women have?

Yes Cannes isn’t about sexual assault, yet they cite Weinstein in the first paragraph.

I’ll give you the reason why there is such a disparity. Equal employment acts were brought into being in the 60’s. It takes about a generation for standards to change. Seeing as how it takes decades to become skillful enough to be a director, it’s very plausible that the biggest reason for lack of female directors is that due to PAST discrimination (civil rights era/generation after) there simply weren’t enough skilled women in the pipeline. That’s a far, far cry from the #metoo era when the words of a women are powerful enough to cause someone to lose their career.

Bullshit I am. Where did I say that? Advocating for public awareness for your situation is not disregarding the law. Why would it be?

&gt; If some of the most powerful, rich and well connected women can’t use the law to fight discrimination, then what hope do regular men and women have?

You're cute, you think women are powerful just because they are in movies? Have you actually not read up on Weinstein's case? The people he abused didn't have any power whatsoever as he managed to use his influence to prevent them from speaking up and cornering them. And there were some rather big names among them. And the fact that Weinstein's escapades were apparently an open secret in Hollywood heavily implies that he was not the only culprit there. This shows systematic abuse of power and discrimination being present there. And the attempt to raise public awareness for this imbalance in terms of an attitude towards women is - if anything - completely in line with the law.

&gt; Yes Cannes isn’t about sexual assault, yet they cite Weinstein in the first paragraph.

They cite it, because the sexual assault incidents are what triggered the entire public awareness. However this does not make the issue exclusive to sexual assault.

&gt; I’ll give you the reason why there is such a disparity. Equal employment acts were brought into being in the 60’s. It takes about a generation for standards to change. Seeing as how it takes decades to become skillful enough to be a director, it’s very plausible that the biggest reason for lack of female directors is that due to PAST discrimination (civil rights era/generation after) there simply weren’t enough skilled women in the pipeline.

&gt;The trunk of her silver Ford Taurus was packed with everything Sharon Shamblaw needed to get through the next three months, including a pile of stationery so she could write to her three kids, Amy Poehler’s biography, and a DVD of the Chicago Blackhawks’ greatest moments leading up to their Stanley Cup victory last year.  Shamblaw, 46, rolled up to Roswell Park Cancer Institute in **Buffalo** on Jan. 25, 2016, expecting to be admitted to the stem cell transplant ward the next morning for an intensive, life-saving treatment program for acute myeloid leukemia.

&gt;That was the plan. Instead, the morning before she was to be admitted, doctors discovered the cancer, which had been brought into remission with several rounds of chemotherapy, had returned. The transplant was off the table. By March 30, she had just two choices: die in a semi-private room at hospital or die at home. Last week, her family rolled a hospital bed into the room she shares with her husband of 27 years.

&gt;“I was so close,” Shamblaw said Monday from her home in St. Marys, Ont. “I believe I should be in Buffalo right now, getting ready to come home soon. I'm not ready to die.  Shamblaw is the latest victim in the breakdown of an essential cancer care program in Ontario hospitals, the subject of an ongoing Toronto Star investigation.  Since the early 1990s, doctors had repeatedly warned the health ministry about this inevitable collision between inadequate resources and “unprecedented demand” for allogeneic stem-cell transplants, but the crisis went largely unaddressed. The health ministry responded last fall by approving more than $100 million (U.S.) to send hundreds of Ontario patients who would have died waiting for treatment in this province to hospitals in **Buffalo, Cleveland and Detroit**. It was supposed to be a short-term solution while hospitals got the funding to add more treatment beds and staff.

&gt;To date, only 19 patients have received an **American** transplant, and Shamblaw’s story sheds light on why.

&gt;Rachmaninoff's ancestors were likely from Kazan, as his surname is connected with the Turkic people. He was born into a family of the Russian aristocracy, which according to the 17th-century Velvet Book was of Romanian Tatar origin, descending from Vasile (nicknamed Rachmaninov), a son of the Moldavian prince Stephen the Great. Rachmaninoff's family had strong musical and military leanings. His paternal grandfather, Arkady Alexandrovich, was a musician who had taken lessons from Irish composer John Field. His father, Vasily Arkadyevich Rachmaninoff (1841–1916), was an army officer and amateur pianist who married Lyubov Petrovna Butakova (1853–1929), the daughter of a wealthy army general who gave her five estates as part of her dowry.

740,"As a German citizen I largely agree with you, but I think it's worth remembering the context of these laws. In the 1940s Germans killed about 6 million Jews in an insane antisemitic genocide. Immediately after the war, and in the 1950s and 1960s most Germans didn't really want to talk about this subject very much. In fact the subject was so taboo that it was virtually ignored in the public sphere. 

The issue is that this amnesia didn't change the reality on the ground and that reality in postwar Germany included a hefty dose of antisemitism. Again remember how profoundly antisemitic German society was in the 1930s and 1940s (and before then as well). Children were literally taught in school that Jews were the enemy and had to be destroyed during those decades and adults took actual steps to make this genocide a reality. These attitudes didn't vanish overnight when Hitler and his allies lost power.

This brings us to the time when these laws were first introduced. After the war there were strings of anti-Semitic actions in Germany against the small remaining Jewish presence. While Germans didn't want to remember the Holocaust too much, statesmen realized that this shit was a bit terrifying given the recent history. As a result, they started drafting laws that targeted new far right groups that denied the Holocaust as part of a new wave of antisemitism. 

Now do I think these laws are necessary today? No. I think German society has progressed to the point where basically every man, woman, and child has deeply learned the bitter lessons of history. Sure, there are some far right antisemitic nutjobs but that is a tiny fringe that can safely be ignored. Insofar as antisemitism exists in Germany it's usually driven by migrants and is more related to Israel than to Germany's ""traditional"" hatred of Jews. So yes, I think Germany is ready to put those old laws aside, but I do understand the reason they were introduced in the first place.",Europa,/r/europe/comments/8j47o9/88yearold_holocaust_denier_given_sixmonth_prison/dywum2c/,HugodeGroot,1526225203

That school siege also had nothing to do with the religion, but the school was chosen highly probably by an Ingush militant since the background of the school, in other words it being the place where Ingushes were held and killed during the cleansing of them from the territory once was Ingushetia but given to the North Ossetia with the Stalin's Chechen-Ingush mass expulsion.

Moat of those attacks were also denied by even the most aggressive Chechen militants, starting with the apartment bombings.

I'm more of a realist, and while I don't think anybody with a sane mind would love war, in a war, killing is something that you have to do. Attacks on civilians and even kids is a whole different issue though and they're not justifiable.

They actually do you the favour of quoting their critics and then never answering them (specifically  Bläser, 2013), instead completely disregarding that they're picking a small amount of errors according to a ""ten point system"" they are the arbiters of from a large set and focusing exclusively on those picks to get the result they wanted.

The point, you see,  is not about scientific diligence in their methodology(page 18, paragraph 1). It's about the fact that they found what they wanted to find. So, a non-sequitor.

edit: I'm not going to go into the loaded descriptors (""controversial Galileo satellite system"", Really?) , doing ""priming"" statements before offering the example and analysis which is ironic since that's what they're looking for (""Unbalanced response options"" and ""Contextual Effects""), the ""bait-and-switch"" tactics of re-formulating questions to suit themselves such as the blatant example in ""Contextual effects"".

Even if soldiers were harmed, it's far far worse to harm a civilian than it is to harm soldiers.

It's outrageously silly that we're buying into the narrative that these people pose a threat because of their scary language, smoke and some rocks being thrown. What's worse is that we accept the idea that Israel is defending itself, rather than considering that maybe those protesting are the ones who are defending themselves. They live their lives under assault and they literally had their lands and homes taken from them. 

So many people who are justifying the treatment of Palestinians, would be absolutely outraged if they found themselves in similar circumstances.

One notable exception is the Audi A8, which is the only production vehicle to offer SAE level 3, currently the highest level of autonomy and the first level in which automation is dominant over the driver.

1015,"&gt; Correct, but these people are irrelevant. If 9,000,000 people don't care, and 1,000,000 cares, policymakers will align the policy with the opinion if that million of those who care -- despite the fact they are minority.

We've had pro-Israel foreign policy ever since 89. Do you honestly believe that it's all because our politicians want to appease some anti-Arab crowds in the Czech republic? Did Havel want to appease anti-Arab crowds? I guess the post-89 foreign policy-makers are secretly islamophobes and arabophobes, right?

Cause you can't possibly support Israel for other reasons than that you hate Arabs. Every single minister of foreign affairs that we have had since 89 must have been an Arab-hater.

Seriously, just stop with this already. You just want to find faults and shit on the Czech society and you will look for anything that can remotely support your belief how we are all hateful pricks.

I've had enough of this, I don't need to listen how you twist one of the good things about our foreign policy as something really bad.

The Czech lands and Jewish people have a historic connection that was traumatically broken during the WW2. TGM was supporting Jewish ambitions for their own state already in the 1920s. After 1989 we have came back to this legacy and it was the right thing to do. Pragmatically but also morally. You don't just throw old commitments, you don't disregard your historic ties, that's not the kind of country that I would like to live in.

&gt; Yes, but your (and Babiš) attempt to profile ""normal"" people is equally wrong. Normal people will care or will not care, but let them decide for themselves.

I didn't even use the word normal, you are just putting that in my mouth. All I was saying is that for an average Czech, this isn't a big deal at all. As a political party, you can hardly win any votes with this, since it's basically all parties that are pro-Israel, except for commies. Who btw. happen to have one of the most conservative voters who you probably would call islamophobic or xenophobic or whatever.

&gt; So you believe Israel will help us in cyber-security and counter-terrorism? I wish I had this belief. So far Israel helped no one but the USA, and we are not the USA. Moreover, Israel has really bad history in some matters, like recent usage of forged western passports for its agents (do you call a country faking your passport an ally?) or attempts to sell nuclear technologies to SAR under apartheid sanctions. I see no grounds for your belief.

I didn't say that it's 100% guaranteed that Israel would help us. You can never know for sure what would happen. But in general it's certainly better to have a partnership with Israel than with the Palestinians when we look at it from the utility perspective.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/8iv2xc/scoop_eu_statement_opposing_us_embassy_move_is/dywhc6n/,kristynaZ,1526203504

* The Trolley dilemma is presented in a closed world: there are no other possible actions than the subject's pressing a button. In real situations, there are other actors involved, who may react. In the advent of a loss of control (which is what the dilemma is about), the important thing to do is to maximize *predictability* of the system, so as to allow other actors to act. For instance, if a car decides to swerve abruptly to avoid someone on the road, they may make the outcome worse than if they assumed the person on the road had planned to jump on the side. This is actually a very concrete occurence.
* The ethical issues of engineers designing car control systems are actually very different. They involve balancing safety with usability. If a car wants to avoid all risks, then at the extreme, they can not set themselves in motion. At intersections, they will give priorities to all other vehicles they can't communicate with and create deadlocks. 

I'm disappointed these guidelines only barely brush over these very fundamental ethical issues: *maintaining predictability* and *safety vs. usability* balance, in favor of this stupid ""Trolley problem"" which is of zero practical value.",,/r/europe/comments/8j21ew/in_a_world_first_germany_adopts_the_first_set_of/dywhfjn/,thbb,1526203750

Edit; to be fair majority of the attacks were done by IRA-related groups, who aren't socialists. However they still don't target ethnic minorities but rather ""the police, prison officers, and members of the armed forces"" (a battle against the UK, not non-whites). So that's still not ""white ethno nationalism"". 

In other words your source does not support your claim. It never mentions any attacks against minorities.

And thats what you totally get wrong. (Most likely because your mind is stuck in a two party system and a direct election of the President.) The ""will of the people"" is represented in the parliament. The government itself is just a tool of the parliament to interact with the reality. Neither is a result of coalition talks connected to the will of the people itself, nor has the government any accountability to the people. The government is accountable to the caucuses of the parliament. For the same reason Merkel isnt the head of state. Infact she isnt even 2nd place. She is 3rd behind the President of Germany and the President of the Parliament. She is noticed the most, because she is the one interacting with the world, yet she is bound to the good faith of her party and has to appease the caucus of her party in the parliament all the time. Because otherwise she has to go. (Which happend to Schroeder before and to Schmidt and to Brandt)

It's late and I might be misinterpreting something because the source doesn't want to work for me, but aren't you off by an order of magnitude?

For Germany to have an incarceration rate of 0.8% we would need ~650000 people in jails and the first [quick source I can find](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/Rechtspflege/StrafverfolgungVollzug/BestandGefangeneVerwahrtePDF_5243201.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) suggests we have ~65000 people in jail or around 0.08%.

The comparison becomes clearer when we compare your data with the US for example:
&gt;According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), 2,220,300 adults were incarcerated in US federal and state prisons, and county jails in 2013 – about 0.91% of adults (1 in 110) in the U.S. resident population.

Yes, that's about adults but there we're talking about ~666/100000 (2016) people in prison when it comes to the total population.

Because car accidents are not intentional attacks. There is no ideology or group behind them.

&gt; white people make up the majority of terrorists in the US and Europe

Firstly, please don't conflate muslims and brown people, thats pretty offensive to people like Sikhs and Hindus. Similarly, many muslims majority countries are white, or black, or asian. Secondly, I'm not talking just about terror attacks but, for the sake of argument, lets ignore the child grooming gangs (seems to be the usual response).

So with all that aside, do you have some statistical evidence for what you say, particularly within the EU. When I've seen this sort of thing before, it typically assumes all attacks by white people are terrorism, even when the motive is not known or stated to be something not political.

Well if that is the case, then you want this bad Iran deal ended.

All that has happened since 2015 is that Iran has been able to earn money from sanctions being lifted, which they are funnelling into the war in Syria. 

The war in Syria metasized in 2015 - you should know, it caused a massive flow of people into Europe. Why do you think that happened in 2015 and not in say 2012? Simple, Assad didn't have money in 2012, but he had money in 2015 to intensify his civil war, thanks to Iran. And Iran had money to give him because this idiotic deal lifted the sanctions on them.

The only reason Europe is protesting about the deal ending is because some businesses who are making money from Iran are lobbying the EU about it.

It's short-sighted. And Europeans like you are backing the EU simply because you've got a pavlovian dog-like reaction to oppose everything Trump does.

It actually makes a very important difference. It's not just ""semantic"".

The Crown of Aragon was not a Kingdom (I've seen many people confusing between Kingdom of Aragon and Crown of Aragon).

The way the Crown of Aragon functioned was very similar to a confederation (like European Union of our present time, omitting the obvious differences). The nations that conformed the Crown of Aragon (mainly Kingdom of Aragon, Principality of Catalonia and Kingdom of Valencia) were virtually independent, each having their own institutions, parliamentary bodies (Corts Aragones, Catalanes and Valencianes) and different legislation. And those working in the Crown of Aragon had to known the 3 languages perfectly: Latin, Catalan and Aragonese.

From the Spanish wiki:

&gt; Los secretarios y escribanos que servían en la Cancillería y que ingresaban en ellas tras rigurosas pruebas, debían dominar tres lenguas, el latín, el catalán y el aragonés, pues en las tres tenían que redactar la correspondencia real (es notable, por ejemplo, la elegancia de la prosa aragonesa que escribe el barcelonés Bernat Metge, y secretarios aragoneses hay que redactan en catalán con total perfección).

I never assumed he didn't identify as British, my point being as long as he identifies strongly with his Muslim Pakistani background he can't truly identify as British. If I go to work in France regularly but still strongly identify myself as British does that mean I'm correct to refer to myself as both French and British? The reason I don't consider a muslim truly British is because Islam conflicts with the values, customs and traditions of this country. If you believe the most important book in the world is one which supports the killing of homosexuals, extreme misogyny, the violent expansion of its message, utter contempt for other religious beliefs, and the implementation of an oppressive theocratic system then how can you belong in a democratic liberal country.

Grooming gangs are a huge issue and I'm quite honestly perplexed by your lack of awareness of this problem. There are many articles you can find online by reputable newspapers that go into detail about the sheer scale but here: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/grooming-gangs-asian-muslim-across-country-uk-girls-children-women-bradford-rotherham-newcastle-a7987381.html. It really depends what you would call an 'epidemic', in my opinion when thousands of girls have been raped by gangs of overwhelmingly muslim Pakistani males, I view that as worthy of the term 'epidemic'. Especially seeing as it was completely unprecedented until the past few decades. Of course if you don't consider that as an issue worthy of much concern then I am perfectly content with considering you a particularly depraved individual.

The goals of migrants can be ascertained through process of elimination i.e if they come to a country and move into the big cities along with their relatives and do nothing to assimilate into British culture then you can assume that it wasn't a love of Britain that spurred their migration, but the superior living standards on offer. On this basis I think its accurate to say that in recent years this has been the significant majority of immigrants. When you factor in the number of migrants that have family already in Britain, the prevalence of segregated communities up and down the country, the majority of people in London being non-white (indicates recent immigration from outside the UK), the Muslim population doubling in ten years, the rapid increase in reported immigrant gang activity, I think that assumption for most non-EU migrants is justified.

Medicine marked up thousands of percentages compared to the rest of the world, expensive and shit internet, crumbling infrastructure, decaying education system.

All whilst the military industrial complex in constantly urging for ongoing war to justify weapon production and to ensure cheap resources and new markets for their corporations.

That's as unfettered a capitalism you're ever going to see before going full fascist or the corporate states of America, it's pure cancer, it's destroyed the whole world, our kids are doomed and everybody's going around like business as usual. 

I agree with you on this one, when talking percentages, the highest percentage of people ever are doing doing alright right now, I'd say around 20-30% of the world population, as compared to 5-10% or much less as it used to be in the past, but that still leaves 4-5 billion people in the same old poverty or worse , 2-3 times the total population just a century ago. And it's only going to get worse for the poor as the inequality grows, as the climate goes to shit, as the rivers and fields and seas get polluted and not even sustenance farming will keep them going.

And even so, we know we have the resources, the technology, the logistics, the man power, the brain power to lift everybody out of poverty in less than a decade if the whole world put their mind on it, yet nobody cares, companies are as busy as always marketing and selling their useless shit and syphoning funds from the economy, dodging taxes,  bribing world leaders to maintain the status quo and getting billionaires ever richer.

Say what you want about socialism, but they got shit done when it was needed, and it was done quick, and not for profit but for the greater good of the people, you don't end up a world superpower from feudal shithole in less than 60 years whilst suffering through 2 world wars and losing half your population and most of your industry. And that's exactly the attitude we need now before it's really really too late. Give me an example of anything even close to that that capitalism ie (the private sector) has achieved since the cold war ended and it no longer needed to prove itself as the better system.

There are for sure benefits, and if we had never joined the eurozone I wouldn't be so drastic in my opinion, the euro is deeply flawed, no point in denying that. 

And I would hardly encourage any country to join the eurozone right now, nor do I hold countries purposedly delaying their entrance.

&amp;nbsp;

Reminder that around 80% of our trade is with Spain, that approximately 75 to 90% of it would stop if we secede and we have a massive surprlus with Spain but a big deficit with the exterior

Here is a good video summarizing some of the numbers (In Spanish):

And a decrease of 18% in real estate purchases

https://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/business/compraventa-vivienda-cataluna-cayo_134600_102.html

Both relative to Spain, after the referendum.

&amp;nbsp;


We are the most taxed (particularly for low earners), most indebted region of Spain. Madrid's tax deficit is 250% our size yet in the 1980's the average Catalan was 10% richer than the average Madrid citizen and already before the referendum this was reversed.

The reason is clear, it is not Spain (which is the most federal country in EU regarding where tax money is raised and spent) but if you look at the markets every time separatism increases our economy and our quality of life shrink.

If you ask actual enterpreneurs, the actual people in Catalonia that pay more than they recieve, their response is clear: https://youtu.be/EelvyaqjGXo?t=5

As for our military interventions - we haven’t declared war since WWII. Which many of us are bothered by, for the record. But the president cannot start wars because you need money to do so. Congress is responsible for the budget so all our milatary interventions are done with congressional approval. If they weren’t they’d have no money to do so. 

The president can coordinate military attacks without checking in with congress. This was born from the Cold War. If the Soviets launch an attack the president cannot reasonably check in before an ICBM hits us. Or North Koreans invading our Southern friends. Makes sense. But it’s limited under the scope of the War Powers Act. A direct response to alleged (now confirmed) Nixon era attacks. There are strict time frames of when the president must notify (48hrs) and how long troops can be deployed (60 days) without congressional approval.

defense for western countries. their presence means that they first need to be destroyed (which is time and money consuming) before going further towards west.

by placing your lines of defense far away from Western countries you can be more relaxed in taking small moves against Russia, because if you push it too far and Russia reacts you are still safe and have time to organize countermoves. Buffer countries will take the first hit tho. 

&gt;  We've seen small concessions like Crimea, but it's a little strange that nothing of the sort has been tried with countries that are actually within the sphere of American protection.

Lol look who's talking again. If you are talking about current day nobody does that in islamic world as well except ISIS and they are dead.

Lol arabs are the gayest people I know please do show me one public execution of a gay person since they are public it should be easy no? Preferably from Turkey since you seem to directly talking to me now.

&gt;call for innocents of other religions to die for your god

Damn you sure are not bright aren't ya kid? Yeah entire islamic world is ISIS lmao you and your little country wouldn't be alive if this were true.

&gt;oppress women, and hate jews with a passion that would make a bona fide nazi blush.

I guess politics is too hard for you to gasp. People hate Israel not jews and it generally has nothing to do with islam. When your people were expelling jews muslim countries were safe heaven for them and your people exterminated jews alongside muslims in your independence war.

&gt;Everyone else in the world has gotten past this.

Imagine saying genocide, sexism and homophobia is gone just to shit on islam. How old are you kid that you think these stuff don't exist outside of islamic world? Congrats in an effort to shit on islam you just denied all crimes that is committed by non-muslims.

&gt;Places that were colonized far more heavily, that were poorer, that suffered from more violence: they are all better than you now

Hahahahah Sure pal Syria and Iraq that were british and French colonies are totally better than Turkey who were never colonized. Damn I don't know why I am taking you seriously this level of ignorance, delusion is just unreal.

&gt;they are all better than you now, they have learned their ideas are inferior and adopted modern ones instead.

Lol and? Are we talking about islam as a whole or countries that political islam is in control? You don't even know what you are criticizing kiddo. Literally nobody here supports islamic governments.

&gt;Islam has utterly failed to do this, and actively refuses to, so deeply does it believe in its superiority and right to dominate all others. This is now

Hey man I think you should really learn what politics is. You seem to think this is year 1400 and religion is the only motivator for anything. If this ""right to dominate"" was islamic thing muslims wold have been united and you would be dead in a war against west.

I am amazed I have to explain this like I have never imagined someone could be this clueless.

&gt;Look at your own trash country actively pushing Kurds from their cities to resettle them with Palestinians. Literally carrying on the same genocidal policies as always

Hahahahahah you seem to not know this kid but kurds are muslims and I won't even get into your idiotic accusation since it is clear you did not read the UN report that came from. You people don't like reading and love to live like sheep so keep on that Erdogan would be proud.

&gt;and there's always some sniveling turk who pops up to try and claim that 'no guys its all the same, were civilized too'.

- and last year there were many bigger terror incidents in Europe which mostly happened during big social events, so the people where schocked and didn’t feel safe anymore.

Sure, the political disintegration of Europe is partly due to the mishandling of the refugee crisis, but you're delusional if you think it's the driving factor. I'd say it has more to me with  the economy and the divide between the south and the north. 

If you think immigration is bad now, just wait until what happens if we keep ignoring climate change. Putting the economy in there seems obvious, the rise of both the populist right *and* the populist left has everything to do with the middle class struggling and a declining share of income on our GDP. Especially when it concerns the south of the EU; the situation is simply not sustainable. Italy hasn't seen a growth increase since the Euro and I haven't even started about Greece. If the southern nations permanently fall behind, I see a bleak future for the EU as a thriving political union.

I've included political disintegration because being driven apart as EU is the last thing we could use in times like these. The only way we can overcome the issues we're facing today is if we work together, yet we're only pushing each other further away. We need some European solidarity over the entire union. And I don't necessarily mean more EU, but the EU falling apart is one of my greatest fears towards a sustainable future of the continent.

And terrorism... I hate to sound insensitive but people should take a class in statistics. You're still more likely to get killed by your own bathtub than by a terrorist attack. Not to say that it's not a real thing and we shouldn't worry about it, but to put it as 'the most important issue facing the EU' is nothing short of completely disillusion.

Not in China. China actually has a very low emigration rate if you look at per capita levels. I also think you overestimate the attraction a country like Germany has vs the US or Australia. Language is a huge attraction point, plus a country like Australia is in a similar timezone(better for calling relatives) *and* has better weather. The US doesn't have the timezone on its side in the same way but most Chinese settle on the West coast, which also has better climate and again, language is more attractive.

South-East Asia, who besides Philippines and Vietnam? Vietnam is aging very fast. Philippines can't supply 1 million people yearly, which is what Germany essentially needs, and those who do emigrate once again choose Anglophone countries over Germany. Sorry to say, but non-English countries have a huge disadvantage here since language integration for a Filipino in an Anglophone nation is very low, given that many already have decent grasp of it. Why would they struggle with a completely new language which also has a much lower diaspora (and hence support network).

Capitalism worldwide is a humongous failure by any metric and claiming otherwise is just shitting on the struggle of the disadvantaged. Just cuz we have phones and internet and medicine does not make us like kings, when most have no way of getting them. It had  last 300 years to pull all people out of poverty as it claimed and yet we still have more poor than at any point in history living about as poorly as any other point in history with the rich richer and more depraved and powerful than ever.

&gt;It's not a good example. We're basically a dead marriage that stayed together for the sake of the children.

Where do you get that idea?!? Our country is an example on how different communities can pull together and coexist, while respecting each other differences and with constitutional protection for minorities. 

This idea that state=people/volk simply doesnt exist, you will always have minorities, no country is 100% purebred. 

We are not an anarchy/failed state, so that already puts us ahead of at least 20-30 countries. In fact, we are a founding member of key supranational bodies, and possible could have a seat at the UN security council. 

Our nation has defined borders, recognised by our neighbours, we have a military and we collect taxes. And in return you get free healthcare, free education and a chance to develop yourself, for both men and women (that already puts us ahead of 3/4 of shit places, incl the US). 

We have a democracy, a representative parliament (well, 5 actually) and wonderfull towns and villages. 

Our country, in its current form is older that most EU countries. It is older than Germany, it is older than Italy. We are an older democracy than Spain. Austria did not exist when Belgium was established in 1830, neither did most of Central Europe.

If anything, him rolling back the Iran Deal makes him more credible. He for literally years has railed against the deal as being shitty, and vowed to pull out of it. As per Israel, it looks like Iran is violating that deal, and in all honesty they were violating it flagrantly by backing up rebels in Yemen, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Obama made a bad deal, and Trump made the right call. Trump is honestly a much better president than Obama, and I'm locked in to voting for him in 2020.

North Korea knows that they tread a fine line between living in peace and getting swatted. The reason why they're negotiating now is because they legit don't know if Trump will first strike. It's in their best interest to disarm once their continuation is guaranteed. 

&gt;Europe does make the hard call, if international law allows us to. If you call somebody degenerate because they abide by laws, that says everything that needs to be said.

International law calls for things like intervening being done through the UN, human rights for everyone. Saudi Arabia sits on the human rights commission. Ironic how international law works, isn't it? I mean, international law is all well and good if everyone agrees to actually follow it. But international law is just a new frontier, and is never binding. The WTO has more authority and credibility than the UN.

That does not delegitimize our beliefs––the beliefs that Jesus, God, established here on earth. The Protestant Reformation addressed issues regarding corruption, though it quite radically changed some of the most important aspects of the Christian faith. Sola Scripture and Sola Fide to name a few. It also removed 7 books from the bible, and unrightfully changed the way the faith should be interpreted.

Slavs that lived in Greece mostly lived in Thrace and parts of Macedonia and they wanted to be a part of Bulgaria but their losses in the Balkan wars prevented that. Hence a desire to join a Slavic state even if it wasn't Bulgaria. The National Liberation Front or Народно Ослободителен Фронт was communist, but their original and main goal was secession from Greece, they were a nationalist group. After they lost they retreated into Yugoslavia and their leaders' ideologies founded political parties in FYROM. And you probably know the rest of the political problems Greece and FYROM have, from the made-up history, the name dispute and irredentism, etc. etc.

Greek Nazi collaborators were unleashed in the Peloponnese against Greek communists, Bulgarian Nazis were fleeing from the USSR because they were being sent to the gulags so they went to Greece which was one of the most destroyed countries other than country's like Poland, there was nothing there to stop them except the Slavic communists who were being armed by Yugoslavia.

2668,"&gt;I just personally feel that more liberal gun laws will not make any society safer

This makes sense from an intuitive perspective. Guns are an easy way to hurt / kill someone, and so the more of them we have around the more likely we are to see crimes of convenience. Simple arguments can more easily turn into murders. It's also true that it makes murder possible to people who otherwise wouldn't be capable: The 90 year-old curmudgeon, who doesn't have the strength to punch or speed to wield a knife, has the ability to take a life with a gun. Same for the bitter 50 year-old housewife, or the 12 year-old trouble-maker. Or, of course, the 25 year-old psychopath who dreams of killing dozens of people...

But the other sides of those arguments are that (1) Guns are known to be dangerous; when you introduce one into a confrontation, it's an obvious deadly escalation. This is not the case with fists or simple weapons. Punching someone, or hitting them with a bat, is rarely intended to be deadly; but it too often is. It's very easy to knock someone out, and accidentally kill them when they hit the ground wrong; or even just hit someone too hard / too many times in the heat of the moment.

(2) In a society without guns, the stronger / better trained you are the easier you can inflict violence on someone. Most men are able to overpower most women. Teenagers can physically do what they want with the elderly. Tall men with big muscles can hurt almost anybody they want. And for the most part it's obvious who can overpower who. Unfortunately this creates a situation where it becomes easy for low-lifes to target those who can't fight back. An elderly woman can be victimised at any time, by almost anyone, and not be able to defend herself; she relies on the fact that most people are good, and can step in to help. But that's not always possible; especially if she lives alone, in a remote area. But with a gun, she can defend herself from even the strongest man. And the same is true for any situation where there's a mis-match in physical strength. Guns give everyone the same power. Importantly, too, low-lifes generally don't know when someone is armed - and so even if only 10% of old ladies have guns, they can't victimise any of them without risking their lives.

The statistics do actually show that armed populations see less violent crime. You can see this when comparing different countries, or comparing US states to each other. This analysis has to be done carefully, though, as different areas have different definitions for crimes (e.g. what might be rape in Sweden, could be classified as a non-violent offence in Canada). So simple graphs - like [this one,](https://i.imgur.com/UT9bjvL.png) which show more guns = less violent crime - are not necessarily valid. However, there have been a number of studies that control for varying definitions, and they do show the same thing.

&gt;the US could minimize their problem through other ways

Absolutely! Even if guns are a part of the problem, there's still a few other things that have a much bigger effect on violent crime. Poverty, social injustice, and gang activity being the big 3.

IMO the US gun crime problem is often mischaracterised. The vast majority of individual states have murder rates similar to European countries, with a small number of dangerous cities skewing the data for the whole country. That's where the lions share of murders are happening, and the causes go well beyond access to guns.

Unfortunately there's no easy solution to the worst of those problems. Maybe legalising all drugs would help dissolve the gangs? Like ending alcohol prohibition did to the mafia. Maybe investing heavily in infrastructure, and creating opportunities for the poor would help alleviate the poverty? Maybe a change in the culture and restructuring of law enforcement would help with the social injustice? I dunno. Thankfully the US seems to be making progress in most of those areas - and violent crime is actually decreasing there! - but it's happening frustratingly slowly :(

2722,"I'm not talking about doctrine I'm talking about the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire where women played a relatively significant role and were ordained. Charlemagne was converted by his wife. Its the later consolidation of the church following its spread. The attempt to control its power that results in people writing the petty rules of administration. Opinionated people that read their words as that of god. I'm pretty sure that Jesus would not be writing the petty rules for a church that he was not around to see formed in his name.  
Jesus chose Peter because he thought Peter was the best person for the job, he chose his disciples because those were the people he chose, not necessarily because they were men. I'd imagine he didn't cup his balls first to check that Peter was a ""legitimate"" heir as the Apostolic Palace would have.  
It troubles me that you fail to see the difference between theocracy and the source text. We can only infer so much and much of what is in inferred is tainted with ulterior motive seeped in the context of the time it was proposed.  

&gt; There is lineage here. 

Are you seriously telling me you see the Catholic Church as king? As a dynasty? How does that make your religion any different from Pagan folklore (i.e. I am Karl, son of Magnus, ancestor of Thor) or the argument that divides the Sunni and Shia (valid religious succession)? According to script Jesus inherited his claim from no man but man can inherit claims from the messiah? Do you not find that an distastful premise rife for nepotism or other forms of corruption? The rapid spread of Christianity would have made it exceptionally hard to later validate the claim of future heads of the church. Just like cuckholding ruins the true knowledge of lineage, poor record keeping and lack of wholly reliable evidence brings much to question about the early church, especially when it was persecuted by the Romans.  

I do like the new pope but to call that man and equal of previous pope is ridiculous in my eyes. They might share a lineage but I believe only one of them has actually focused on the important parts of Jesus's teachings and the bits that make Christianity actually good (e.g. inclusionism, humility, charity). To me this undermines the idea of lineage. The fact that previous pope is equivalent to new pope is just bizarre as they have such differing outlooks. 

&gt; I can't see Jesus as a reformer.

What did he do if not rebel against the orthodox of the time? He was executed as a firebrand, as a revolutionary. Much like the way Siddhārtha (Buddha) railed against the injustices of the caste system and brought them to light. That's part of the reason they were relevant. They saw the world in a different light. Jesus specifically saw the injustices of Roman society and Hellenistic religions and preached that humans were _equal_ and we all had an equal place in heaven if we accepted god. That kings and slaves would be equal in the afterlife. That was radical heresy for the time. That's why it sold and that's part of why they probably executed him and why Christianity eventually spread so far and wide.  

None of these messiahs would have achieved anything if they didn't question the doctrine of the time and the tragedy of organised religion is that it takes the teachings of these revolutionaries and attempts to impose it as a new form of unquestionable doctrine much like the Hellenistic doctrine that justified slaughter, sacrifice and slavery that existed prior and Jesus preached against.

From the article you linked:  

&gt; I hope that Catholics in the diocese will understand that it would be sinful to receive a fake sacrament from a woman priest, and that includes attending a fake Mass.

So at what point did Jesus claim this specific use-case as sin?  

He continues (I add the emphasis):  

&gt; That was just a rhetorical question, friends. **I believe**, with the Catholic Church, that when Christ instituted the sacrament of Holy Orders and selected only men to serve as priests, **he was giving us the blueprint for how the Church should operate.**  

Oh so its not god that tells us this, its not Jesus that tells us this, its man. Its man. Its man that claims to know the will of god. 

Here's a theoretical question: if Jesus _had_ chosen a woman as one of his disciples what would the next attack by made to invalidate a woman's right to be priest? Because I don't think we can doubt that humans _would_ make one.   
When people impose rules from interpretation and not decree one has to ask oneself if they are scanning the texts to justify their thought or the texts are informing their thought. To me, rules like these reek of the former as opposed to the latter and the Catholic church's handling of this issue sums up my distaste for _organised_ religion in a nutshell.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/8i8k9y/samesex_adoption_is_now_legal_in_greece/dyu5xin/,_tpyo,1526081216

Also, unifying all EU armies into a common European army would have the added benefit that it would work nicely both with and without NATO. With NATO, it would simply be a large entity inside the treaty; nothing would fundamentally change. And if NATO eventually collapsed for whatever reason, Europe would be able to hold its ground.

No, but who am I to dictate policy for the Americans? 

Now, if you asked me if I thought the EU would be in a better position if they aliented the U.S. - especially under the current administration, but also to avoid falling into the state of neo-colonialism that appears to be the norm - the answer would be yes. Short-term economic harm for long term political gain is an okay trade in my book.

While PP is branded as being of the nationalist right because of it's past, everyday I'm beginning to think that C's are much further to the right based on the rhetoric they have been using lately.

Same

&gt;Their saving grace for a lot of people is that they are from Catalonia and therefore they will know how to handle the seperatist and still be legitimate in the eyes of other Catalonians. I don't think that's the right way to think about it, but a lot of people seem to think that. 

Then those people don't understand the situation at all. Rivera is far weaker in Catalonia than people think because all in all he got ""only"" 25% of the votes and 36 deputies. The other 2 big parties are both separatist and have 34 and 32 deputies each so he is facing strong opposition. And the only party he can securely rely on to push the most nationalistic parts of his agenda (the ones that bring votes in other parts of Spain) is PP, which in Catalonia has only 4 deputies. EnComu will never support him and it would be a suicide for PSC to back anything that would affect in any way the status quo (the only reason they haven't dropped is because they played the card of ""Catalanism"", which means attracting all those who despite not being separatists don't feel compelled by the discourse of any other party effectively becoming a center party, in this group I include myself) so even if the separatists lost their majority, they would have to win by a landslide to even form a government (which is unlikely since I think he has reached almost the top of his potential voting base. Ciudadanos would never be able to hold a government because they would have the Separatists, the Left wing and the Catalanists againsts them. The spanish nationalist discourse has never penetrated much in Catalonia and I think it is the furthest it will ever reach.

&gt;Exactly and the point that he's missing too is that if he gets elected, he still needs to work with them(and the Basque PNV who has done nothing illegal). His stategy which appeals to a lot of people seems to be to smash seperatism down so hard that it won't be strong enough to have influence instead of sorting out the problems in a democratic way, but he is mistaken since that never works. 

Exactly, crackdown has not worked as it has only resulted in a greater polarization of the Catalan society. His strategy won't work.

3126,"**Europe's top groups increased sales and profits more strongly than their competitors from North America and Asia last year. However, a company remains the measure of all things worldwide.** 


According to a study, Europe's top companies are one step ahead in terms of growth. According to a study by the auditing and consulting firm EY, they increased sales and profits more strongly than the competition from North America and Asia in the past year. In terms of profitability, however, they are still lagging further behind companies from the United States:


""On average, American companies generate 26 percent more profit than their European competitors,"" explained Mathieu Meyer, member of EY's management board. According to the figures, the 265 European companies that made it into the top 1,000 companies in the world in terms of sales increased their revenues last year by ten percent over the previous year to a total of 6,954 billion euros.


The 327 top North American companies achieved an eight percent increase in sales to a total of 9,136 billion euros. The 361 Asian groups achieved an increase of six percent to 7969 billion euros.


Europe's major corporations were also ahead in terms of profit growth: operating profit (EBIT) climbed by 21 percent, while the Asian and North American groups achieved growth rates of 16 and nine percent respectively. Europe's top groups benefited from strong foreign demand and the significant economic recovery, even in the former European crisis countries.


**Germany in fifth place in the country ranking**


However, nine of the ten companies with the highest operating profit are based in the United States. The iPhone manufacturer Apple achieved the highest profit last year with the equivalent of 54.4 billion euros. The South Korean electronics giant Samsung came in second with 42.0 billion euros. The car manufacturer Daimler, the most profitable German company, ranked 18th with 14.7 billion euros.


A total of 44 German companies made it into the 1000 largest corporations in the world. Germany ranks fifth in the country ranking behind America (305 companies), Japan (144), China (82) and Great Britain (47).


According to the study, Volkswagen ranked fifth worldwide in terms of sales, Daimler ranked 15th, followed by BMW (34) and Siemens (45). ""German companies are currently also doing well in an international comparison,"" said Meyer.


In the sectors of the future, however, the United States and China are significantly better positioned than Germany. For example, 11 percent of the top companies came from America and 12 percent of Chinese companies from the IT sector. In Germany and Europe, on the other hand, the share is only five percent each. ""We must be careful that Europe does not fall behind here,"" warned Meyer.

3153,"*Long chats with ordinary voters yield interesting results*

EUROPE DAY, an occasion known only to employees of the European Union, who get the day off, was spoiled this year by an ill wind from the west. Donald Trump’s decision on May 8th, a day before the festivities, to withdraw America from the nuclear deal with Iran cast a shadow over the EU’s proudest foreign-policy achievement and further widened the transatlantic gulf (see article). Rather than belting out Beethoven and settling down to reread the Schuman Declaration, European politicians were forced to spend the day mulling euro-denominated credit lines and the dangers of secondary sanctions.

But there was a small glint of sunshine for Eurocrats amid the gathering clouds. Europe Day was also the occasion for a curious experiment, launched with little fanfare in the form of an online questionnaire for European citizens. This was the fruit of a “Citizens’ Panel” conducted the previous weekend. Nearly 100 ordinary Europeans, selected for characteristics that roughly matched the demographic profile of the EU, had assembled in Brussels to thrash out a list of priorities for EU decision-makers. Finnish social workers rubbed shoulders with Greek tourist agents, Romanian builders and Maltese housewives.

Charlemagne attended part of the exercise, and encountered a lively and engaged set of discussions. The participants were told that no topic was off-limits, and some took that instruction to heart: one Slovene urged the EU to resolve the confusion caused by the existence of two rival European basketball federations. But on the whole the themes that emerged—migration, security, climate change—would not have been out of place at an EU summit. It was a scrappy and rushed affair, but on its own terms probably counted as a moderate success. Most participants, at least, left Brussels declaring that they had had a jolly good time.

**We have built Europe. Now we must build Europeans**

Yet some also wondered, aloud, what would happen next. The answer is vintage Brussels. The questionnaire published this week will form a basis for Europe-wide “citizens’ consultations” designed in turn to inform meetings of EU leaders later this year and next. Meanwhile, each government will hold its own form of consultation on European matters. Nathalie Loiseau, Emmanuel Macron’s Europe minister, says France’s debates have been lively affairs. Yet none of these worthy endeavours will yield specific policy results, which makes it hard to see how they will generate real enthusiasm. “People don’t see the meaning if there’s no bite,” says Claudia Chwalisz, a Paris-based analyst.

Contemporary attempts to foster a common European spirit do indeed often seem to flounder. Luuk Van Middelaar, a Dutch author, charts an example in “The Passage to Europe”, his history of European integration. In the wake of a worryingly low turnout in the 1984 European elections, the leaders of what was then the European Economic Community agreed that their faltering club needed a flag to rally round. But when it was time to sign off on the plan, some leaders feared it might look like a Brussels sovereignty grab. And so a compromise emerged: the governments agreed to call the 12 stars on a blue background that now flutter from government buildings across Europe not a flag but a logo. This ambivalence is often to be seen in the EU. The club fears a loss of legitimacy, and so tries to assemble it from the top down. But resistance or hesitation forces an awkward compromise.

Why is this? Partly because the much-maligned distance between the EU and its voters is a feature, not a bug. National governments have by and large preserved their rights to legislate on matters that most exercise citizens, such as the appropriate level of taxation or the management of public services. Wheezes like direct elections to the European Parliament, or the Spitzenkandidaten system for choosing the president of the European Commission by respecting the result of the European Parliament’s election, are presented as injections of democratic adrenalin into Europe’s flabby body politic. But they have signally failed to budge voters from their national silos. Participation in European elections has steadily fallen since their introduction in 1979, even as the parliament has accumulated powers.

That has only made the EU more vulnerable to the barbs of sceptics. National governments are partly to blame; many take credit for successes and are happy to condemn Brussels when things go wrong. But how can discussions on the EU accommodate citizens who distrust the whole enterprise? Mr Macron thinks honest debate will disarm many; he blames pro-Europeans for yielding ground to their opponents. When the EU’s 27 governments signed off on Mr Macron’s plan to create a system of citizens’ consultations in April, they urged special attention to be paid to the EU’s critics. They also insisted that the consultations retain a national character.

Such pressures make it easy to assume that Europolis will remain for ever out of reach. But common threats and the risks of leaving projects half-built force countries and voters together, too. In “Democracy When The People Are Thinking”, a forthcoming book, James Fishkin, a political scientist at Stanford, argues that Europeans can overcome national and linguistic divides to conduct a common conversation under the right conditions. Plenty of the participants in Brussels noted with delight the curiosity of encountering people from strange countries who shared their values and concerns.

Their leaders should take note, for this spirit will prove useful. The euro zone needs better systems for pooling risk, and more resilience to external shocks. The EU needs a stronger asylum system to weather the next refugee crisis. But mistrust between governments is hampering agreement. Both issues may come to a head at a summit in June. The EU will always rely on dealmaking to overcome its divisions, but a sense of common purpose can be useful. Not Europolis, then, but a step or two towards it.

3155,"&gt; Nobody prints money anymore.

Of course not. It's a figure of speech to point out how money is created out of thin air. 

&gt; In a modern economy, money (supply) is created and destroyed on a daily basis to match the fluctuations and the cycles of the economy.

Oh, really? Who knew?

&gt; In the case of QE, the ECB purchases assets, which means that for each euro it creates, it buys an euro worth of bonds, for a net gain of 0. On the aggregate, while it is true the the ECB balance sheet increases, there is no net wealth creation.

Oh come on, that's just a truism. Confounding the ECB's balance sheet with the overall economy, are we? No matter how you look at it: It's a fact that the ECB is buying up assets nobody else would buy. And no matter where the Euros it pays for those assets come from, the ECB pays them for real, thereby circulating a tremendous amount of money which otherwise wouldn't be there. Hence 'printing money', figuratively speaking. 

&gt; If anything, the QE, which is mildly inflationary, helps the German saver, which otherwise would need to pay the bank to hold his money.

No sane person would pay a bank to hold their savings. In fact, a rational actor in this case would take their money out of the account and store it under the mattress and save those costs. That's precisely the reason behind the constant attempts by the ECB to do away with the large Euro banknotes.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8iip9i/macron_tells_merkel_her_budget_fetish_is_hurting/dytcjpi/,ColourFox,1526052807

&gt;The belief that sexual preferance is also analogus to the self-identification and how a person perceives its own gender and role in society is very, very old school. So, it never becomes clear to me why ''this is gay'' is a must-say and ''this is straight'' is considered the -how to put it- norm(?).

Straight is just the norm becouse of numbers. If you ever visited a gay dating site they are more indepth then hetrosexual once.

The stereotypes that exist today may be built on a negative view of only specific kind of gays. But belive it or not, some men are only attracted to lether guys like in that bar from Police Academy movie.

&gt;As for the Eurovision and chinese broadcaster, i never commented on them. I commented on a user here saying ''watch this, its the gayest thing ever''. Which is nonsense. Being gay, as i also said, is a sexual preference, not an identity or a role. Gay men who are attracted to eurovision are not attracted by it by their ''gayness'' or the preference in homosexual intercourse. Besides, what is a less or a more gay thing? You cant be more gay or less gay just like you cant be more straight or less straight.

Depends on what philosophy you chose to belive in, but i see your point on grading an event of its gayness.

But thats the point. Why categorize people with their sexual interests. Its makes no sense to me, unless there actually is some kind of inmost phobia or at least some kind of belief that sexual interests affects other aspecs of a persons identity and behavior. The belief that sexual preferance is also analogus to the self-identification and how a person perceives its own gender and role in society is very, very old school. So, it never becomes clear to me why ''this is gay'' is a must-say and ''this is straight'' is considered the -how to put it- norm(?).

On the aggregate, while it is true the the ECB balance sheet increases, there is no net wealth creation.

3268,"That's garbage. There's not an open country in the world where there aren't gay people out. Even in incredibly repressive regimes, it still goes on, which is why some poor souls get thrown off buildings in the Islamic shithole countries. Like when that cretin Ahmadinejad declared there was no homosexuals in Iran. I can tell you from personal experience of being an out guy in London that you won't see any Muslims in gay bars, or on marches, or any other visible activity. On gay dating/match-up sites however, they are absolutely everywhere and very frustrated. Never a photo, but desperate for clandestine meet ups.

We may not know precise statistics or percentages (for the reasons you mention) but I absolutely guarantee there are gay people in EVERY society, and probably to a similar degree.

3275,"&gt;It's bad when American citizens even think Europe should have it's own security but to the European governments, saying such a thing is a 'threat' and loss of power for the US.

No, what's bad is that America, which for a long time has lobbied its European allies to increase their own capabilities and be more equal partners, has been willing to subsidize Europe for decades. Yet but every single time European leaders talk about building up their own capabilities instead of acting as good faith equal partners they immediately speak of telling America off. It goes to show that they have been interested in taking advantage of the US as much as possible and uninterested in real friendship.

&gt;Everyone now sees that the US and EU are more trade rivals, former allies rather than current close allies.. when you have more in common with Iran than another ""Western"" country. 

The EU is upset that its corporations won't make money selling goods to an active state sponsor of terror who had a nuclear weapons program, which it had hidden, and has spent it's ""Please don't develop nukes money"" on ICBM research and further conflicts against the US and her allies. This is just like the Nord Stream pipeline where key European powers are interested in enriching themselves at no matter the cost to their allies.

&gt;Thank god the US will never regain the control it once had. It's slowly but surely losing power to the Chinese/Russian/Iran/North Korean group, with EU slowly leaning toward China more than the US.

What a laughable statement. China's 16+1 initiative is  chipping away at European unity for the purpose of directly influencing and declawing the EU through it's democratic nature. It's already shown it's ability to do so via Greece and getting it to veto a joint EU vote condeming the situation on Human Rights in China. Unlike the US, China has a long memory and sense of pride. It suffered greatly at the hands of European colonialism through it's hundred years of humiliation.

3344,"&gt;The European Court of Human Rights said that Spain had wrongfully condemned two Catalans for publicly burning a photograph of the king and queen, saying that the act was justifiable political criticism.

&gt;In their unanimous ruling, the judges said they were “not convinced” that the burning “could reasonably be construed as incitement to hatred or violence.”

&gt;In September 2007, Enric Stern and Jaume Roura set fire to a life-size, upside-down photograph of the royal couple during a visit by King Juan Carlos I to the northeastern city of Girona.

Context does not make statements true or false. Statements *are* regardless of conditions. 

What you guys are showing with your counter arguments, trying to explain how context makes a statement true or false, is that had someone else said what this individual said in the video in a context you feel more in agreement with, it would make it true for you.

Truth is not held by subjectivity, opinions, or context. What is *is*. What isn’t *isn’t*.

Wow, I'd never thought of it that way before. You may have a point. 

However there was a stark difference in response to bank insolvency between the UK and Ireland. Before the crisis had fully taken hold the Northern Rock had been nationalised at the start of 2008 whereas the Irish government's knee jerk response later in the year was extremely weak in comparison. It underwrote all the domestic banks liabilities without nationalising and restructuring them and essentially told them to carry on the very practices that had undermined them and in this they had very strong public support.

A) we are actually talking about it all the time ;) ""A)"" is military spending to which you said you have no opinion... and then became an expert one comment later :)))

When it comes to nord stream, I said all I had to say. If you want to response you are free to do it.

Of course you spend more, because you have bigger economy. That is obvious. What were you expecting? 
And if you say you are willing to chip in 2% I'm a happy guy. And of course our government is suspicious when it comes to Germany becoming regional military power, but even they understand it is better to have strong ally at your west boarder rather than strong enemy at the east. Also as long as you stay effectively under US military presence, you will not be perceived as thread.


And no my friend you don't pay them cos you want, you pay because they control all sea trade in the world. Meaning they effectively control whose export is cost efficient and whose isn't. Withour good relationship with US not only Europe would be defenseless, but also had big trouble selling its products. It is the same what British did historically. I hope your policymakers know more about it than you do. Cos you seem clueless when it comes to transatlantic relationship.

International development aid... right https://youtu.be/dxhj4Jg3dzU

Now don't get me wrong I'm all for it, but it is just another way to buy influence from one perspective and it isn't as efficient as having an army.

Thanks for the report, but beside saying the obvious, that PiS government isn't as pro-EU as PO was, it doesn't give any specific reason to why Germany and France did the deal on their own without getting us in. Also I think that should change too. Because without Poland you can't secure the region and security is a base of any good alliance. Angela Merkel knows it, that is one reason she chosen Warsaw for her second trip destination after Paris. Second is that by all probability we will become center hub for China's products coming to Europe by land and European going back to China will go through us as well. And thirdly she understood something you still keep on missing that you don't need to like people you do business with. That is why it is called business. Trump for example is an idiot, so what? It doesn't make him always wrong, nighter does it make me always right simply by disagreeing with the guy.

Also why would Polish government care about other countries not fulfilling 2% obligation. You are next to us and you are the biggest economy on the continent. Seriously we can make it without Belgians paying their share, without Germans we will be left with much more costs, but more important it shows lack of political will to defend your allies and that is much worse.

Also you can't have it both ways... eitherour our government nags about you not spending enough on your army or they are terrified about the idea and don't want to see that. Have your cake or eat it.

Of course they are considering what you might do in the future, they would need to be complete lunatics not to, especially given you do deals with Putin undermining our security, while wanting Europe to be independent from US military protection yet not spending enough on your army to be a real alternative to them. I mean come on. That is not the way you do things. First you stop undermining other countries security, then you grow your own army in close cooperation with parties involved, then you secure your economical well being, by for example land trade road to China and then you can tell Americans to go home. Not the other fucking way around.

Lastly you trying to put me in PiS supporters basket, simply because I don't agree with you is sad.

Russian oil monopolies earned up to two trillion dollars of revenue during the oil peak period. Where did the money go? Were they strategically invested into some Death Star project? Were they invested into other state monopolies for the times when the oil prices will inevitable get low?

France does seem to have a form of citizen's arrest as well, but it doesn't look permissive enough for that structure to be possible, since they can only arrest people if they actually catch them committing the crime.

Of course, the UK could go further than she does:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_hunter

&gt;A bounty hunter is a person who captures fugitives and criminals for a monetary reward (bounty). The occupation, also known as bail enforcement agent, bail agent, recovery agent, bail recovery agent, or fugitive recovery agent, has historically existed in many parts of the world. However, today, it is found almost exclusively in most of the United States and its former commonwealth, the Philippines,[1] as the practice is illegal under the laws of most other countries.

-

&gt;In 1873, the Supreme Court ruled that bounty hunters were a part of the U.S. law enforcement system with a decision in Taylor v. Taintor.

-

&gt; When undertaking arrest warrants, agents may wear bullet-resistant vests, badges, and other clothing bearing the inscription ""bail enforcement agent"" or similar titles.[5] Many agents also use two way radios to communicate with each other.[citation needed] Many agents arm themselves with firearms; or sometimes with less lethal weapons, such as tasers,[5] batons, tear gas (CS gas, pepper spray)[5] or pepper spray projectiles.

Airbus does significant business with the USA, and if Airbus continues to supply Iran with tech, planes and other economic aid, this will mean Airbus executives will be sanctioned. So if they have any US assets, including stocks or bonds of US companies or US treasuries, those will be seized, and they could be arrested by airport security if they attempt to travel to the USA.

There's no way European countries will openly defy US sanctions. There's really no way that European allies such as Macron and Merkel will choose Iran over the USA.

Like in case of Airbus, they are out of the Iran deal thanks to at least 10% US technology that the can't replace and will not use in case of Iran.

Another point the banking system and even smaller companies need to use them on a daily basis and in most cases the larger ones will get into trouble if so would do business with the US and lend money to a German business that would work in Iran. The solution here is that the another way like the European Investment Bank or something similiar.

Last case the will aim again the so called blocking regulation from 1996 that adds another layer of protection and fines.

Homogenized tax rates prevent jurisdictions from competing against each other with lower taxes. Homogenized environmental protection laws prevent the free market from punishing countries with more regulations.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_raising_a_child

They don't have Poland, but raising a kid to 18 is not cheap.  It does have developing countries, so we can at least bracket it, because it sure isn't going to be less-expensive to raise a kid in Poland than a developing country.

&gt; Based on UNICEF statistics, in developing countries the cost is roughly US$900 for raising a child for a year, and US$16,200 for raising a child from birth to age 17.

For India:

&gt;Based on an estimate by Economic Times in April 2011, the cost of raising a child from birth to age of majority (21 Years) for a middle to upper-middle income family comes to about ₹55 lakh (US$84,000) in total.

-

The US costs are broken down by income bracket and marital status of the parents, but raising someone to 17 in the US sees spending averaging $157,410 for the least expensive bracket  to $389,670 for the most-expensive bracket.  Note, critically, that this does *not* account for time expenditure or foregone wages on the part of the parent: it only measures what a parent is going to go spend on products and services related to the kid.  It also excludes placing a value on the discomforts and risks of pregnancy and birth, maybe getting stretch marks, etc, though if you can find someplace in the world that offers surrogate mother services (legal or illegal) you could probably get a ballpark estimate there.  It also excludes any university costs that the parents bear.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-politics-subsidy-idUSKCN0ZZ19L

&gt;Opinion polls suggest the 500+ subsidy, introduced in April and named after the monthly 500 zlotys ($126) per child it offers, is proving popular for the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party as it battles accusations of undermining democracy.

That's $1,512/year.  I don't know how many years the Polish government pays the subsidy, but let's say up to 17 (and I suspect that it's a lot less).  That's still $25,704 -- nobody is *making* money having kids (if you're excluding stuff like old age care or whatever), or anything like it.  But it does offset some portion of the cost.  There will be some proportion of Poles who would have been on the edge of having children, and for whom this will be enough to tip raising a kid over into being something that they want to do.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8iinf9/subsidising_babies_has_bolstered_polands_ruling/dyskvi5/,vokegaf,1526010745

They literally, nonironically stole our jobs because the government would always prioritize them. We could not strongly speak of these things because speaking against Gülen was like speaking against Erdoğan. They stole the university entrance exams, nobody heard our disapproval. They jailed the secularist establishment in the army, nobody heard our outrage.

You are too gullible to see Islamists for what they are. Criticizing Gülen used to get you into trouble with the government. Now praising Gülen gets you into trouble with the government. Animal Farms will continue to decide who is good and who is evil or about how we were always at war with the Gülenists, but there is a reality that supersedes whatever the Western media or Turkish government decides to paint as white or black in accordance with their politics. There is a reality painfully recognized by as an effect of long series of events that have affected everyone here that exists beyond the alternative, fake realities created.

3907,"That's a huge strawman even for national chauvinism, put aside nationalism. In this era, what you do when you need more anything is apply good economic policy, not flip out at everyone around you \- that's not a reaction any sane person will give you. Good economics are not something mutually exclusive with nationalism. 

Nationalism can be used as a pretence for corrupt action, but so can literally anything and we're seeing it right now. Some do it in the name of values, others in the name of security and some even in the name of equality. Nationalism isn't the only thing used as an excuse. Your problem isn't with nationalism, it's with idiots who lack the ability to think and trust me \- those idiots are the majority of people representing virtually any group. Even if you magically erased nationalism from the Earth, this wouldn't alleviate the problem the smallest bit, because the idiots that fall for demagogue trickery are still around.

And no, borders are not imaginary. Borders are not arbitrary. They are very, very real. So real in fact, that you can find maps made for all sorts of categories. Demography, population density, religion, birth rate, spoken language, cultures and culture groups, unemployment, poverty or wealth, number of practitioners of given professions, etc. etc. etc.  All these things have shaped national borders throughout millennia and rejecting them as 'arbitrary' and 'imaginary' is naive at best. If you don't believe in borders, then you should open up your home 24/7 to any stranger willing to drop by. I guarantee you that you won't like it very much.

If you want to make a planet\-wide confederation, be my guest. I'd be happy to see a greater degree of cooperation between the different peoples, but that should only be done with sufficient respect for the different nationalities that would constitute such a confederation. Anything besides that is simple oppression with an ideological or material goal in mind \- and countering that is one of the reasons why nationalism was born, by the way. To protect the various nations from oppression. People like to point to the 1940s when they talk about nationalism but always forget about 1848.",,/r/europe/comments/8ich9x/national_polish_tv_strikes_again_german/dys6do1/,Ctsako,1525994697

Furthermore, this was an ""arbitration"".  
This means that the parties involved (Russia on one side, Ukraine on the other) agreed beforehand to appoint the court of this issue, and this agreement between the two nations is what gives the court of ""arbitration"" power in the first place. So, in short, the Court of Arbitration can judge over nothing, ever, UNLESS a couple of sovereign Nation States agree to settle a dispute in front of this court's judges.

4070,"&gt;But there are situations when having a gun allows to kill more people without resistance and in shorter time (like school shootings)

This is where the argument lies, IMO. Spree killings make up such a small percentage of overall homicides that they don't skew the data. Access to legal guns may very well be causing mass murders to be worse than otherwise, and we wouldn't see that in the data.

One side of the argument says that guns make spree killings worse; that firearms are such an efficient tool for murder they allow psychopaths to kill more people (than they'd otherwise be able to).

The other side will say that spree killers can and do use other methods that are just as deadly - such as home-made explosives (in the case of the IRA), black-market firearms from war-torn countries (like with the Bataclan), or even vehicles (like the Nice attack or 9/11) - and that the most effective way for ordinary citizens to step-in and stop these attacks is to have an armed populace. A certain percentage of ""good people with guns"", that there's always one around when needed.

Personally, I think both of these arguments have merit. However, there is no data (that I know of) which shows how much of an effect each have. Maybe a comparison of the number of mass killings per country vs. firearms ownership rates might shed some light on it?

4135,"&gt;However the commission's proposed budget on 2 May shows that migration has certainly not slipped down the priority list.
&gt;
&gt; In fact, it advocates a six-fold budget increase in budget to Frontex from €320m to €1.87bn in 2027 and an envisaged 10,000-strong standing border guard corps.
&gt;
&gt; The budget increase belies the rhetoric of Juncker that ""Europe, contrary to what some say, is not a fortress and must never become one.""
&gt;
&gt; It shows that Europe is being fortified more than ever. What is more – and far less visibly the fortress is being expanded through a policy of so-called 'border externalisation'. 

I don't think that the budget increase is necessarily indicative of that.

When you have any organization that permits free (or relatively free) movement internally, you need to restrict movement at the outer edge.  This doesn't just apply to Schengen and free movement, but also for things like the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border situation.  Specifically, states with an exterior border cannot be in a position where their interests in level of enforcement or efficacy of enforcement differ from that of the organization as a whole.  That means putting the organization as a whole in control of exterior borders.

The US federal government handles borders and requires all members to pay in.  It doesn't force the exterior states or counties to pay for border enforcement, and it doesn't let them set enforcement policy.

At some point between now and EU federalization, I expect Brussels to both acquire policy control of external EU borders, and to acquire responsibility for paying for enforcement on those borders.

So I don't think that this is xenophobic or even particularly opposed to illegal immigration.  I think that this simply is part of EU integration.

If that is the case, I will expect to see member states reducing their border enforcement budgets, and maybe some sort of hiring program for the EU to hire border officers away from member states to reduce disruption.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8igrvh/opinion_europes_solution_to_migration_is_to/dyrrcye/,vokegaf,1525980377

4185,"&gt;Europe has 500 ships 

500 if you count ships which have not been 'rated'. IE they are smaller then a Corvette class in size and tonnage. This would include everything from port tugs to coastal patrol vessels. IF were counting these then US fleet is more like ~750+ ships, not including the US Coast Guard, which by itself is the 12th largest navy in the world. But we generally do not since tug boats and patrol craft are not fit for war. If your send tug boats to war, your scrapping the bottom of the barrel.

 &gt; 4 EU carriers are fleet carriers.

US navy doesn't designate anything smaller then 100,000 tons as a Fleet Carrier. While European Navies might consider the 42,000 ton Charles de Gaulle a Fleet Carrier, its displacement puts it in the same vein as an America Class Assault Carrier at 44,000 tons or Wasp class assault Carrier at 41,000 tons. If we are going to count the Charles de Gaulle as a Fleet Carrier then we are speaking of the US navy as a fleet of 22 fleet carriers. The Cavour at 27k tons and its smaller cousin the Giuseppe Garibaldi are definitely not fleet carriers by any definition. Even If we ignore the US definition and use a straight British/French definition. its still 2 fleet carriers and 2 very light carriers against what is essentially 22 Fleet carriers. hardly in the same league.

The rest of your numbers are also very off, If you take the F-16,F-15,and T-38 fighter fleets they alone add up to more then 2000 aircraft before we even get into the F-22,F-18,F-35, ect programs. 

Same for your tank number, the US army has some 8800 M1A1 Abrams tanks and 6,000 Bradley's, not including the tanks of the Mariner Corp. about the only number you got right was the number of total active military personnel. 

I do not know where your getting your EU numbers from, but given the mistakes in your US numbers I would double check those too. Though I will just take your work for those, im not going to add up 28 different nations military equipment. Especially when they are not one military and answer too 28 different governments.

I'd argue that exposure certainly provides a platform for indoctrination, that is how the Catholic Church has operated for decades. Indeed, the ability to influence the youth is a matter of importance for all religions, it is the reason why Nigerian schoolgirls were taken by Boko Haram. Is minimal exposure likely to have a significant impact on a child? I don't believe so. So, in answer to you question, passing a Mosque probably won't lead to a conversion to Islam.

That was probably phrased badly. I didn't mean to imply he was, although admittedly, it looks like I did. What I meant was, Hitler and Stalin were. I was trying to say that Piłsudski, bad as I think he was for Poland, was nowhere in the same league as Hitler or Stalin. I was going for ""well, at least he wasn't genocidal"" in a sarcastic way, but upon rereading my own comment, that's hard to read from the sentence. Sorry about that.

As to the rest of your comment... I gotta say, at this point I can just say, we have to agree to disagree, and leave it at that.

Frankly, if the US leaves NATO, it would be **much** different than lets say the Paris Climate Agreement, the loss instead of being fairly substantial would be astronomical \- but I strongly believe the EU would be able to rapidly deploy systems of government to manage over a new sorta joint military.

So let the heat come, even the sanctions if needed and perhaps Germany can threaten to remove US bases from Germany if any escalation between the US and Iran works.. Germany can play the US game of 'no facts necessary' to take action.  😉

Everyone  now sees that the US and EU are more trade rivals, former allies rather than current close allies.. when you have more in common with Iran than another ""Western"" country.

Well yes, because Russia has multiple times used gas price as political tool. Before NS2 you could not fuck with countries that had pipeline going trough them with prices. For example when Baltic countries introduced EU third energy package that supports liberalization of energy markets, Gazprom offered gas price discount if countries delayed enforcing this packaged. Latvia and Estonia agreed, Lithuania didnt and in turn for having more liberal energy markets that are less prone to corruption Lithuania had to pay higher gas price.

Nationalism is a bit out of this. Countries can get along while being nationalistic. From wikipedia:

&gt; Nationalism is a political, social, and economic system characterized by promoting the interests of a particular nation particularly with the aim of gaining and maintaining self-governance, or full sovereignty, over the group's homeland. The political ideology therefore holds that a nation should govern itself, free from unwanted outside interference, and is linked to the concept of self-determination. Nationalism is further oriented towards developing and maintaining a national identity based on shared characteristics such as culture, language, race, religion, political goals or a belief in a common ancestry.[1][2] Nationalism therefore seeks to preserve the nation's culture. It often also involves a sense of pride in the nation's achievements, and is closely linked to the concept of patriotism.

Nothing about claiming foreign lands or hating on the other nations - that would be fascism and nazism, which is a bit different concept.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/8ich9x/national_polish_tv_strikes_again_german/dyqzb95/,DashLibor,1525951695

Actually money is hardly enough for Poland to sustain pipelines and company managing it is joint venture with Russians.

CIS is centered around moving gas from, and to the various countries in CIS. Especially Russian ability to sell this gas and share part of revenue/offer lower prices on energy commodities for CIS countries.

Central and Eastern Europe are pressured by Russia every now and then. In that situation, with Nord Stream 1 &amp; 2, Central Europe and Eastern Europe would need to rely on Germany, which in turn would rely on Russia.

Germany becoming middleman between Russia and Central and Eastern Europe is not ideal solution I think. It can also put Germany in various scenarios with bad outcomes for Central and Eastern Europe.

Also NS 1 doesn't use full capacity. So NS 2 is imho mostly for geopolitical reasons.

4601,"&gt;When does one become ""Swedish""? When does the ""immigrant"" background get discarded from statistics? Is it after 1, 2 or 3 generations?

The second part of the piece touches on that subject

&gt;""The interesting thing is that in several previous instances there were reports written which detailed the matter of crime by foreigners – I was involved in two of them – and at that time there was no opposition. But when the Brå report was published in the 1990s, people asked how long people were going to be treated as immigrants in connection with the stats – two, three, four generations? There was a lot of discussion about that,"" Stockholm University's Tham recalls.

&gt;""The judgement we made is that looking at the four previous studies we did of roughly the same kind the results were very similar. Immigrants were overrepresented in crime, but the gap was reducing by the generation. Second generations are less over-represented. So we felt that there was no huge value in doing more because the results were pretty stable – what we knew was sufficient for our work,"" Holmberg explains to The Local.

Of course they do. It's not like they have a choice anyway. In fact, most math teachers pretty much only teach high school level maths in the first year.

&gt;What happen when all courses are full? Which is the case in France. 

Is it? While universities may indeed be somewhat overpopulated, it happens the most in over-selective courses (such as medicine). In fact past the first few months, any licence class is just fine when it comes to the number of students. Masters are different, but there is already some selection going on before going in there.

&gt;Why are they criticizing the French system then? The reproduction of elites is strong in France with the current system 

Criticizing a system and saying it already reproduces elites at an alarming rate doesn't make the argument valid. More selection before the university obviously reinforce elites reproduction.

Obviously the french system is full of issues, but equally obviously, more selection beforehand is certainly not the solution.

The purpose of it was not known so it is difficult to demand that people would predict it. Polish army was crashed at the beginning. Polish Underground at the beginning was focused on the fight with the aggressor having limited means. What do you expect? How suddenly Poles were supposed to liberate them when they were not even able to defend themselves? Another issue is whether Jews decided to ask for help, whether they made use of Polish proposals or what actions they took. Poles tried to warn them as it was possible. Poland also tried to receive external help using diplomatic efforts. Different organizations and countries were informed about the situation but not much help was received. For example when Polish ambassador to the USA gave Americans crucial information about the Auschwitz camp and asked them to bomb tracks leading to Auschwitz when it was already possible, it was ignored but it could have saved Hungarian Jews.

That's what Polish Jews wrote to American Jews:
&gt;We do not understand your silence - Polish Jews write to American Jews again. - We received no response to the five sent messages, and despite the appeals and alarms, no funds come for us. Why does the Joint not send money? We can still save thousands of Jews, women and children from the destruction and inevitable death. We must have substantial funds. Alert the Joint and all other Jewish organizations immediately. We must have one hundred thousand dollars to save the remnants of Jews. We are waiting for your help.

And there's more of it. And to appeals for help to the Jewish circles hurried to help only... the Polish government in exile, allocating additional funds and calling on Polish society to help in keeping Jews on the Aryan side.

I expect that there are diplomats who work under him.

Many ambassadors are political appointees, as I understand it.  Some are actual diplomats.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Tefft

This guy was an actual diplomat.

&gt; Tefft is a career member of the U.S. Senior Foreign Service, with the personal rank of Minister-Counselor. He joined the United States Foreign Service in 1972 and has served in Jerusalem, Budapest, Rome, Moscow, Vilnius, Tbilisi, and Kiev.
&gt;
&gt; Until his appointment as ambassador to Georgia, he was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs since July 6, 2004. Tefft also served as International Affairs Advisor (Deputy Commandant) of the National War College in Washington, D.C. From 2000 to 2003, he was the United States Ambassador to Lithuania. He served as Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow from 1996 to 1999 (when Pickering was Ambassador), and was chargé d'affaires at the Embassy from November 1996 to September 1997. Tefft served as Director of the Office of Northern European Affairs from 1992 to 1994, Deputy Director of the Office of Soviet Union (later Russian and CIS) Affairs from 1989 to 1992, and Counselor for Political-Military Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Rome from 1986 to 1989. His other foreign assignments included Budapest and Jerusalem, as well as service on the U.S. delegation to the START I arms control negotiations in 1985.
&gt;
&gt; In addition, he has served in a number of positions at the State Department in Washington, D.C. and held a fellowship, working in the United States Congress.
&gt;
&gt; On September 30, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Tefft as the next ambassador to Ukraine[3] and he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on November 20, 2009.[4] Tefft arrived in Ukraine on December 2, 2009[4] and President Viktor Yushchenko accepted Teffts credentials of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary on December 7, 2009. The Ambassador expressed his hope for fruitful cooperation. Tefft delivered his speech in Ukrainian.[5]

&gt;
&gt; He also served as a member of the National Finance Committee of the 2012 Barack Obama presidential campaign, a position he also held during the 2008 Obama campaign.[5]

4840,"&gt;Oh I think this has nothing to do with accidently shooting down a plane, you're making that clear. He'll never appear there.

You're not making any sense.

&gt;It wasnt deliberate, so, not murder.

Firing a anti-air missile at an airplane is as deliberate as it gets. If I shoot blindly into a crowd am I accidentally killing people for not properly checking to see if there are any civilians in my way?

&gt;Well, in 2001 a russian airliner was shot down by Ukraine forces. You dont even know that or you would have mentioned it. In fact it matters so little to the world that no one mentions and no one cares. Ukraine payed some minor compensation, refused to accept fault, no one was punished, no one remembers.

This is completely different. The fact that you're trying to compare these situations shows that you have absolutely no intention of arguing in good faith.

&gt;Initial private assessments of American military officials said the crash was caused by a S-200 that missile overshot its target drone—which had been destroyed successfully by an S-300 fired at the same time—and instead of self-destructing, locked on the passenger plane about 250 kilometres (160 mi) further away and detonated 15 metres (50 ft) over the plane.[13][14][15][16]

This was an unfortunate accident from a training exercise and completely different from an aggressive act of war. If you can't acknowledge that there is no hope for you.

&gt;But in reality its just a cynical tool to attack Russia and they and you dont give a fuck about justice.

So you believe Russia should not be held accountable for starting a war of aggression on European soil killing thousands and murdering 200+ EU citizens?

So your position is that the UK is a traitor to the EU for choosing to leave, and should be punished accordingly. It's certainly a different position. 

How do you align this view with the fact that membership is optional, and that the Article 50 process predates Brexit? If it was a traitorous decision as you say, why would the option to leave be available? Typically things that deserve punishment are not allowed, hence the punishment for doing so... 

Also how do you align this traitorous view with the unilateral pledge of continued and unwavering military support for the EU irrespective of the outcome of negotiations? Surely that is not the action of a traitor?

For an opinion poll to have statistical merit for a population the size of the UK, you need to have circa 1600-2500 participants.

If 2500 gives you statistically valid results upon which you can reliably predict and extrapolate out to 65 million people, how much more accurate do you think it is when you have 33 million people?

I mean, maybe you are someone that puts absolutely no faith in any sort of opinion poll at all. Maybe you don't believe these so called experts, maybe you've had enough of them.

Maybe you could point out any vote in the recent history of the UK, that received more votes than that to leave the EU?

5101,"&gt; Meanwhile, mobilization in the Muslim North Caucasus, especially Chechnya, failed entirely; collaboration was so extensive that deportation of their entire people to Kazakhstan was more humane than the “legalistic” alternative, which was the execution of most of their menfolk.

maybe because it was not collaboration for them?

seems like Russians genuinely expect from enslaved peoples to fight for them in their wars.

collaboration is when they do fight on your side, not against you.

&gt; Here are a few real national ideas worthy of Russian civilization:

&gt; The regathering of the Russian lands

&gt; Genetic IQ augmentation

&gt; Atomically blasting Imperial Russian Navy battleships off into space

There's another one to [consider](https://www.podari-drova.ru/)

5162,"&gt;Karl Marx famously critiqued the basic institutions of the welfare state in his Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League by warning against the programs advanced by liberal democrats. Specifically, he argued that measures designed to increase wages, improve working conditions and provide welfare payments would be used to dissuade the working class away from socialism and the revolutionary consciousness he believed was necessary to achieve a socialist economy, and would thus be a threat to genuine structural changes to society by making the conditions of workers in capitalism more tolerable through welfare schemes.[16]


&gt;Marxian socialists argue that modern social democratic welfare policies are unable to solve the fundamental and structural issues of capitalism, such as cyclical fluctuations, exploitation and alienation. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate the issues of capitalism – such as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits – create further contradictions in capitalism by limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.[12] Therefore, the welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment.

&gt;When national security adviser John Bolton stood before the White House press corps on Tuesday detailing President Trump’s decision to walk away from the multilateral nuclear agreement to constrain Iran’s nuclear program, it reminded some observers of events 15 years ago, when Bolton was a cheerleader in the Bush administration for the invasion of Iraq, intended to dismantle Saddam Hussein’s stockpile of weapons of mass destruction — which turned out not to exist.

&gt;While technically the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the agreement among Iran, the United States and five other major powers, can remain in effect even after Washington pulls out, Bolton’s history suggests that the administration may have a more ambitious goal to implode the agreement altogether. The sanctions Trump is reimposing aren’t just on Iran but on other entities that do business there, such as banks.

&gt;Despite pleas by the leaders of Britain, Germany and France, the Trump administration has given no indication that it will exempt their banks and businesses from new sanctions, which could make it impossible for European countries to stay in the agreement.

&gt;In a statement issued by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and British Prime Minister Theresa May, the European leaders expressed regret over Trump’s action, stated that “This agreement remains important for our shared security,” and pledged their continued commitment to it. Meanwhile, even while Bolton was announcing new sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani insisted that his government is also still committed to the nuclear deal. “If in the short term, we conclude we can achieve what we want” from the agreement, it will survive, he said in a televised address.

&gt;To understand why the Trump administration’s unilateral action could scuttle a multilateral agreement negotiated by all the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia), plus Germany, it’s important to recall why the economic sanctions placed on Iran proved so effective in the first place. As part of the post-9/11 war on terror, Treasury Department officials discovered that U.S. sanctions targeting terrorists and weapons proliferators created such risks for international banks and lenders that depended on dollars for transactions that they voluntarily refused to do business with targeted entities. Iran was essentially denied access to the international banking and global financing systems.

&gt;In his remarks Tuesday, Bolton left little doubt that the administration was reinstituting those crippling financial sanctions, and he gave no indication that the administration would offer exemptions to banks and corporations from allied countries.

&gt;“Well, the decision that the president signed today puts sanctions back in place that existed at the time of the deal; it puts them in place immediately,” Bolton told reporters. “Now, what that means is that within the zone of economics covered by the sanctions, no new contracts are permitted. Treasury will be announcing … what they call ‘wind-down’ provisions that will deal with existing contracts. And there will be varying periods within these contracts to be wound down. Some will extend up to six months; some might be 90 days.”

&gt;As a former senior Treasury Department official, Juan Zarate helped design the sanctions regime that proved so effective in isolating Iran. If the Trump administration reinstates it, he doubts that Britain, France or Germany will be able to maintain the economic engagement at the core of the Iran nuclear agreement.

&gt;“The reason the Iran sanctions worked so much better than three decades of sanctions that came before was that the Treasury Department demonstrated that the risk of doing business with Iran was simply too high for legitimate businesses,” he told Yahoo News in a recent interview. “Even if the Trump administration was willing to exempt some allied companies from the new sanctions, an environment in which the United States is imposing sanctions again will make it very uncomfortable for any legitimate company to continue doing business with Tehran. A sanctioned Iran will just inherently have trouble continuing to reintegrate into the global financial system.”

&gt;Philip Gordon of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) helped negotiate the Iran agreement for the Obama administration. He also believes the lifting of U.S. sanctions was such a core part of the deal that it’s not likely to survive a new sanctions regime. “Iran and other countries could continue to implement the deal even if the United States is out, but it’s hard to imagine that scenario lasting for long, as it would effectively deny Iran the main benefits it was promised in exchange for freezing its nuclear program,” he said in a recent written interview on the CFR website.

&gt;Given the blunt force power of U.S. sanctions on an international financial system that relies on dollars to conduct transactions, the most likely scenario is a flight from economic engagement with Iran that eventually topples the foundations of the nuclear agreement. The consequences of such a collapse are unknowable, but they could include a return by Iran to its uranium enrichment program, a nuclear arms race in the region as its archrival, Saudi Arabia, follows suit, and the beating of a familiar drum heralding yet another war in the Middle East. At the very least, one unavoidable consequence will be the further erosion of European confidence in the quality of U.S. leadership, with potentially dangerous political — and economic — repercussions.

&gt;“The Trump administration’s walking away from the Iran nuclear deal is likely to accelerate the search for other currencies than the dollar as the primary holding currency, because even our allies believe the United States is being very heavy-handed in imposing these ‘secondary sanctions,’” said Kori Schake, deputy director-general for the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. “By walking away, Trump is also dramatically strengthening Iran’s geopolitical leverage in terms of driving a wedge between the United States and its chief European allies, a longtime goal. So the Trump administration is rapidly burning through goodwill towards the United States that accrued over half a century, and it will be very costly to get it back.”

- The classic of alcohol being legal but not other hard drugs because alcohol has been going on long enough even though it's a hard drug
- Legal names and how they work; the system of legal names that is in play is absolutely unnecessary in the age of digital record keeping where everyone is a number and is a huge privacy violation that everyone has a name which on top of that also goes from parent to child by requirement; there is absolutely no need any more for persons to have a legal name but they keep it because it's tradition.
- The entire way marriage and family works is designed idiotically in a vacuum but it's the way it is because the Netherlands came out of a culture of one male-one female marriages + children and all that stuff and they are now sort of trying to rework the system but also trying to keep the system familiar enough
- The speaker of the lower house was apparently actually empowered to refuse a male politician a speaking term because he wasn't wearing a tie; this speaker—who is female—also didn't wore a tie but is some-how not expected to hold herself to the same standard because traditional gender roles mandate that males wear ties.
- It's a monarchy; this is kept purely for traditional reasons and if it had always been a republic no one would say ""Hey guys, you know what we need? A hereditary head of state""
- There's no rule that requires that headlights are on during the day for driving even though so much research shows how much it reduces accidents but people think it's weird because they are used to the idea that they are only on during the night when driving.t
- There are some bizarre gender rules and segregations in place which just exist to make a distinction for its own sake which would've never put in place if they weren't traditional.

5228,"&gt;There doesn’t need to be the same as in Germany for that argument to work and I don’t see how being on the victor side of WW2 means that the argument can not be made. It seems more the mind set of the media and politicians that is at fault here.

The argument could be made, but I don't think it'd be anything like as successful. If I speak to my German friends, they have a massively different take on the EU, most of it rooted in the defence and peace angle. That is (in my view..) a false narriative, and one that is very different if you are looking at the UK (not least because there have been British troops in Germany for decades..). Yes politicians could spin people a yarn, but I fail to see how that'd be better unless the aim is just to remain in the EU.

Or I'll put it another way, yes, if we had had a very different political narriative on the EU over the last 30 years then sure, we could have been more positive about membership. But we didn't, and that isn't going to change rapidly, certainly not in terms of rejoining soon.  

&gt;The membership drives the parties policy so in theory they should have adopted a more pro EU stance to reflect that. Anyway, I do think that Labour are slightly more pro EU than the Conservatives, although obviously still wanting to go through with it. Labour isn’t bogged down by so many vocal hardliners.

They did adopt a pro-Euro stance up until the referendum. At that point the party made a decision to take a different (slightly less anti- than the Tory) position on the EU..

&gt;It is absolutely true that those Conservatives controlled areas having a higher population density. With many of the Labour sets being located in areas that voted strongly to Remain, especially in the South, where the Conservative seats tended to vote leave, although many of them were pretty evenly split.

You sort of have to ignore the midlands and the West of the country, and exclude Scotland.

&gt;Maybe not, I am probably getting a pretty skewed view by looking at too many FBPE Twitter accounts. But is still definitely there.

It's there but its not very common.. And yeah, it's hard if you try to use twitter as a gauge of anything, I think I currently follow a fairly diverse group (but note that my following is a tad skewed..) but mostly avoid twitter at the moment anyway..

&gt;So a pretty strong majority?

Yeah, that's why I started with 'Yes', the point is that minority is still very large..

&gt;They did, it was a comparison between now and what happens in hypothetical Brexit scenarios. 

They didn't though did they, they looked almost exclusively at the economic impact, with some social aspects, and quite a few worst cases in some other areas (usually assuming no mitigation). The point is that we value different aspects of EU membership differently and that leads to different notions of what a good/bad end result is, and whether leaving/remaining makes more sense..

&gt;Britain isn’t required to give any new powers to the EU than it wants to. In the EU the UK has the option to, veto, opt out of certain things and negotiate in such a way. 

Right, but if you want to be part of an EU with fewer competencies, there is no real road to that at present. Not only does it go against the status-quo, it goes against the direction of travel and the consensus among other members.  What's worse, the UK not wanting to see any new competencies passed to the EU is a barrier to further EU action..

&gt;Inside the EU the UK could also greatly influence policy and such things have to get though the UK’s system before becoming law.

And outside of the EU it doesn't have to abide by those laws at all.  In terms of self determination, legislation, control and so on I agree that there are benefits of a large, prosperous, effective union, but there are also benefits of being on the outside if you happen to be a large country.  That calculus changes obvious, for say, Poland or Spain the EU has been a major boon in areas outside of the economy, institutional stability, rule of law, and so on. It has granted small members a say on the world stage they wouldn't have had elsewhere too. But the UK hasn't seen anything like the same scale of benefits and so the balance is in a bit of a different place. If someone suggested Poland, Ireland or indeed Germany leaving the EU I'd probably disagree with them, but not so much for the UK..

&gt;No the whole thing was rotten to the core and it created a toxic environment around the time that it was first announced and more so afterwards. The fact that an MP lost her life during all that says it all, really.

I can't disagree with any of that, but I do think that if we'd have seen a more positive message from the pro-EU side, people would have been better able to make a decision. I think it might have pushed more people toward leave, but who knows.

&gt;Yours are clearly different to mine. You should be able to elect politicians who are able and use various democratic means to influence the process such as protest, write to your representatives etc. No need for referendums and it is harmful to do so.

And yet our elected politicians decided to hold one..

&gt;So they are sacrificing their principles and doing something they knew is the worst option based on a pretty slim majority on a glorified opinion poll? Got it.

Depends on whether it was a principled position or an opportunist one really, or indeed whether it was a fairly soft position.  I'm sure you'd agree that an elected representative is able, and indeed should look to his constituents best interests and their views?

&gt;Yes represent what they think is in their best interests not do whatever is popular.

So does every elected politician in a representative system to one degree or another. That's how they get elected.  If you want people to do what you think is 'best' by some criteria, you probably want something along the lines of a a fairly autocratic technocracy, with yourself at the head offering the criteria..

5261,"&gt;I think membership of the EU political project when there is so little support for it 

I think you are missing the point to be honest, the purpose is to lead public opinion and convince them to embrace your vision for things. Just saying that something is unpopular doesn’t matter if you believe it should, you just have a higher mountain to climb. 

&gt;is a bad thing for the UK

I think it is a good thing for the UK to be more integrated in Europe and I think that it would help give the UK more influence and control, not less. The UK pushed above its weight for so long, largerly because of Empire and innovation but no longer has a great Empire to fall back on and large emerging markets are becoming much more prevalent so being intergrated with the EU gives the UK that. 

&gt;The solution is to leave now so that we can build a productive relationship with the EU

It is not that simple as Brexit has clearly shown and being part of the EU gives the UK an edge that it wouldn’t otherwise had, I would argue even more so if it was to pursue closer intergration.

&gt;In that context, the referendum was a far better solution than having to support parties whose broad agenda I dislike

Then you pick the party with the issues that you are closest to, if one thing is more important, you vote on that. Besides, most of UKIP’s rise happened after David Cameron announced it. The referendum wasn’t much better in that regard, it was extremely wide ranging and complex answer into a simple yes/no answer. Leave was everything from EEA+ customs union to complete withdrawal from everything, while remain was anything from lesser of two evils to full federalism. Also if you voted leave you were voting the same as far righters as well as politicians like Nigel Farage and if you were voting to remain you were voting the way that the current government wanted to so both ends had a lot of baggage. 

&gt;I think they will end up in the same situation UKIP is in now

That is ignoring why UKIP are in that position, they ended up like that because they have largely achieved their main goal and so are regarded as pointless. Most of the people in the party are there because they were before more than anything. The rejoin the EU campaign wouldn’t have so you would still get a fair amount of campaigning, afterwards. It could simply be like it is now, where all hope is loss post referendum to where there is serious campaigning again.

&gt;Joining the EU will require the reversal of most of the things the UK has had to do to leave the EU. 

Not really the UK would have to fill in the same objectives that other members do, just because it is out of the EU doesn’t means that it doesn’t currently meet. It could join the EEA to make it faster and that is what the EU was hoping when they created it. Finland, Austria and Sweden did that before hand so it is an option for the UK.

&gt;The problem tends to be the same one though, the best chance by a large margin is preventing the UK from leaving, 

It doesn’t mean that it is all over if Brexit happens, they could just regroup and come up with a new course of action .

&gt;Having to run a rejoin campaign once the UK is out however is a much bigger task,

I agree but it is still doable

5264,"&gt;I'm curious as to what will happen if/when the M5S/Lega government collapses followed by new elections. Will there be an anti-populist backlash from the electorate, or will the current stalemate and aversion to establishment parties continue?

Sadly I don't think I have an answer to this, Italian politics lately is very fluid and can change drastically very quickly so it's very hard to guess. 

Just to give you a few examples:

Renzi got 40% of the votes in European elections back in 2014 seemingly out of nowhere and was one of the most if not the most popular politician back then but in the span of just 2 years nearly everyone both in the right and the left despised him(for different reasons obviously but still you would find nearly the same number of people hating Renzi with the same intensity on opposite sides of the political spectrum).In recent elections Pd got 18,7 of the votes compared to the 25% of the national elections back in 2013 and the 40% of the european elections back in 2014 back when Renzi first debuted as party leader.

Lega went from being a regionalist party called Lega Nord(Salvini dropped the Nord/North part when he rebranded the party) on the brink of death back in 2013 with 4% of the vote(quite close to being below the minimum threshold to enter parliament) to (thanks to Salvini) rebranding themselves as an Italy wide nationalistic party a la Front Nationale fighting for ""Italians First"". This Move brought them to get 18% of the votes in the recent national elections with Salvini becoming the leader of the whole Centre-Right Coalition.

As you can see the situation is quite fluid in italian politics lately and can change radically very quickly. As a rule of thumb whoever ends in government in Italy usually end up losing quite a lot of votes but still it's difficult to make accurate prediction as of now.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8i8vvt/italys_berlusconi_gives_green_light_to/dyq06dq/,un_Fiorentino,1525901637

5309,"The idea that you are somehow responsible for for a government you did not elect is very real and WW2 set a very strong precedent over it. By living in a democracy you agree that the will of the majority decides the course of action to take for the country, this does not mean you are bound to it. When you live in a flawed democracy and you do not challenge the system you are making the conscious choice that it is better to keep the status quo and you are responsible for what it becomes to the prorata of the power you had to change it (one vote among others). If you do not flee your country or sabotage it when it tries to genocide part of the population you are directly deciding that you consent with the social contract and what's more you participate in this system n'y paying taxes, a high percentage of those going to the very achievement of that genocide. You can say it's not worth the risk to challenge this participation and so you chose the crime over your comfort but even before this system was put in place you participated either for or against it and could take action then that was less drastic for you.

The idea of the citizen sheep, completely disconnected from the political system is the very thing that enable these totalitarisms, the goal of Propaganda is entirely to disconnect the citizen from the reality of the politics by making it seem like nothing makes sense, everything is relative and nothing is possible. 

If you are a US citizen and you refuse to see that you are financing with or without your consent, with half of your taxes the bombing of Iraqi civilians in order to pay cheaper gas in order to produce more efficiently you are a fool and if you refuse to move or participate in changing this system you are a guilty fool, like so many of us.

&gt;The relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland was tenuous at best during World War II for a variety of reasons, and became more so, after the 1940 Katyn massacre of over 20,000 Polish servicemen by the Soviets came to light. **However, pragmatic general Władysław Sikorski was still open to some form of normalisation of Polish-Soviet relations, while general Władysław Anders was vehemently opposed.[1]** To boost morale, Sikorski began a tour of inspection of the Polish forces stationed in the Middle East in May 1943, tending to political affairs where necessary.[1]

According to Wikipedia he wanted to improve Polish-Soviet relations.",,/r/europe/comments/8i4yii/til_that_in_1943_de_gaulle_survived_an/dypjb5f/,FiszEU,1525887041

5452,"&gt; The Soviets came in 1944, the last Germans left Estonia in 1944. You were re-annexed in 1944. Calling May 1945 a ""start of occupation"" is at least slowpokish.

Who's calling it start of occupation? I'm not, it's wrong to call it that way. I'm merely saying it's not a Victory Day for us.

&gt; The Soviet Union/Russia/whatever you want to call it was free a lot earlier than in May 1945. France was liberated in 1944 as well. Nobody celebrates 8 or 9 of May as a ""freedom day"".

France was a winner country of WWII. So was Soviet Union. Estonia was not. 

&gt; They did greet the Nazis with open arms back in 1941 and were a trustful ally for them all the way to 1944.

Again, who's this generic ""they""? Estonian government was not calling any shots at that point. Do I have to remind you that it was your dear Soviet powers that had eliminated the Estonian government by then. In many of the cases, literally – they just shot, deported or put the government officials into a mental asylum.

&gt; I myself also see your side as losers and actually as our enemies in that war, so why would it matter for me how do you celebrate/not celebrate that day?

Whatever way you see it, I still need to emphasize that it was Soviet Union that invaded and occupied Republic of Estonia, not the other way around. Now I could get into details about how it affected people's mentality and turned them against Soviets (and pro nazis, unfortunately), but does it matter? The point is that there's no way USSR would be seen as liberators here, it's just against any sane person's rational thinking.

&gt; Haven't heard any battles involving the Estonian freedom fighters against the Nazis. Might be just my lack of knowledge in this field, I don't know.

You also haven't heard any Estonian forces fighting against Soviets, but you somehow believe that. Estonia was overrun, it capitulated before USSR, there's no questioning that, but it doesn't mean it wasn't occupied. That's why, just as the official position, we can't take positions in the war as there was no common Estonian position. There were people of this country fighting for both sides, but nobody fought for Republic of Estonia. And those sides can commemorate the fallen, but our country will not pick a foreign dictatorship to glorify with that.

&gt; It's a Victory day against the Nazis. It's as simple as that. The Nazis lost on that day. There is no connection between that day and your freedom.

Then consider it as another achievement of Russia's ""amazing"" foreign policy. Because this day has become some freaky metamorphosis of Russian chauvinism, USSR glorification, Putinism (George's ribbons, anyone?) and whatever for many.

As I explained, I understand the day's importance for Russians, or at least I try to, but I expect Russians to understand our position and that it might not be exactly the same as theirs. I can go to Russia and celebrate it with them, but I expect they also e.g. refrain from calling it ""liberation"" in this region. 

But I get it, we're small, they're big, they can allow themselves more.

&gt; Minister of defense praising the SS veterans, calling them a freedom fighters, is official enough for me.

Could you then please refreshen my memory? I mean really, if it was some event in early 2000s, it might have been the case, but I can't recall anything that in recent history.

&gt; Historically it was done under the Red banner and under the Soviet command; the veterans have the Soviet medals and orders which they proudly wear on their chests. I praise all this.

Yes, but in 21st century, I'd expect to also realize USSR did a lot of horrible stuff as well. 

I also have old pictures of my great grandfather in the army of Republic of Estonia, of how they were caring for monuments of independence in my region, all of which were blown up by Soviets. Pictures of a town that was bombed down by Soviets. We have relatives that were deported to Siberia. If I took similar mentality as many Russians, we should literally treat anyone who shows any sympathy towards USSR as people who celebrate destroying our independence, killing our people.

5511,"Yes, he has the power to sign an agreement. And a subsequent President has the power to overturn that. It is not a treaty, which requires Congressional approval. You can blame Obama for that, as he did not want to lobby Congress for a treaty ratification.

I am sorry if you do not understand how the US Government signs and ratifies treaties. But, your political leaders do. See also: Kyoto Treaty and Paris Accords.

For whatever reason, President Obama did not sign and submit many treaties.

&gt;the Senate approved two treaties by unanimous consent: an extradition treaty with Chile and an extradition treaty with the Dominican Republic.  This brings to six the number of treaties approved by the Senate in the Obama Administration’s second term. (In 2014, the Senate approved four fisheries treaties.)  The Senate approved nine treaties in the Obama Administration’s first term, bringing to 15 the number of treaties approved by the Senate during the Obama Administration.  This is the fewest number of treaties approved by the Senate in a four-year period or eight-year period at least since World War II (and probably much longer -- some intrepid law student will need to check).

&gt;In contrast, the Senate approved 163 treaties during the eight years of the Bush administration, including a record 90 treaties during the last two years of the Administration. Ironically, under a President who most Europeans and many international law professors are convinced did not believe in international law, the United States may have become party to more new treaty law than during any other eight-year period in U.S. history. -https://www.lawfareblog.com/senate-approves-two-more-treaties-bringing-obama-administrations-treaty-record-fifteen",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8i3zqq/europe_iran_pledge_to_uphold_pact_without_united/dypavy3/,TheNaughtyMonkey,1525879488

5558,"And Saudi Arabia is far behind Europe in terms of social development; it didn't emerge as a cohesive national entity until relatively recently in history, so of course it's not as far along in the societal transition yet. Different parts of the world move at a different pace. For historical reasons, Europe begins in the lead, but already in Asia, in Indochina, in West Africa, as economic growth and educational attainment expands, we see new forms of cross-border interconnection.

I concede that this is a process that takes time, but I can't imagine it being reversed; can we truly conceive of Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, or China devolving back into their constituent territories? The suggestion is preposterous. These people have been integrated into a larger societal unit. Now in the European context we simply witness the same process on a grander scale, and it accelerates every year as cross-border communication and exchange expands. 

If the tribe exists in our DNA, then it is our conception of it which evolves. We can stretch and change the borders of our own ""tribe"" in our minds; it is up to us to define it. Is it a family? A wider group? A nation?

There was an Irish political scholar named Benedict Anderson who wrote quite an influential book back in the 1980s called *Imagined Communities*, which was a study on nationalism. That's what he calls nations, ""imagined communities"" because even though we'll never know every citizen of our own nations, we feel as if we have some sort of connection to them. Anderson says:

&gt; ""Regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.""

But the link is imaginary, it is simply the modern incarnation of our tribal instincts. So why draw the border at the nation? Surely I now have a network of friends and coworkers across four continents. I'm just as close to them, no, closer in fact, than as to most of those who live in my own country. So why shouldn't I feel a sense of community? Of global community even? 

And why should a European identity be any stranger than a German, French, Polish or Italian identity? This, I think, develops with time. I mean look at this sub, we see a daily expression of this communal spirit here.

5574,"&gt;Second point is that it's kind of a strawman to discredit something because there is a crackpot book that says the same. If a politician said taxes should be lowered and you got a drug addict to appear on camera and say the same, this doesn't remove validity from the politician's claim.

First of all that's not what straw man means. 
&gt;A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent.[1] One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man.""

Second of all, even if we accept you definition, this wouldn't be relevant. 
There are only two sources, mentioning this event. 
When one of them is literally ""Ancient aliens"" level conspiracy bullshit it doesn't exactly support the validity of other source. Or the entire claim.

To follow your example, if the **only other person** proposing to lower taxes **is that one drug addict**, then the politicians claim is very much lacking.

&gt;Labour: Trump is a bully

It's not a bad thing to show Trump that the US, despite being the most powerful nation in the world by far, can't do whatever it wants if the rest of the world disagrees.

&gt;After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.
&gt;
&gt;The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.

That's part of Trump's statement. 

""If we do nothing...""

You don't pull out of the deal, just for the sake of pulling out, when you're convinced that Iran is developing a nuclear bomb, as Trump apparently believes.

I can only think of two things that could happen. Either Trump is trying to force Iran back to the negotiation table to make a deal that's more strict than the current one.

Or he's aiming for something [entirely different](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/05/giuliani-trump-iran-regime-change-570744).

I mentioned war drums beating louder yesterday, and apparently, a lot of people disagreed.

And I could be wrong about all of this, I'm wrong about a lot, but I really don't see any other outcomes than the ones above.

Because the only ones who complained were just a group of senators, instead of the Senate as an entity, who did not have standing to challenge the president so the Supreme Court declined to hear their complaint and directed it the lower courts to reject it the same.

If the Senate had passed a resolution saying that the withdrawal from the Taiwan treaty was null and void then it would've been a conflict about the division of powers in the US and the Supreme Court would have been essentially obligated to decide it.

Takes some balls to put words in someones mouth

&gt;I don't think I have heard anyone make the claim that immigration is the only solution to the problem of aging populations.

The two are constantly linked, on the other hand campaigns promoting natives making children are attacked as sexist and racist. one plus one equals...

&gt;undoubtedly, immigration has through the years contributed to European economic welfare

Quotation needed.

If in most European countries migrants (even after several generations) are still less educated and less employed than natives, then I'd find it hard to argue that without them there wouldn't have been a smaller burden on our taxes and as a result a higher purchasing power per family.


&gt;which is undoubtedly a critical problem

Prove it. Just saying it isn't enough. Why is it 'critical'? Why can't we build an economy that doesn't require the template of perpetual and unending growth? And why, most importantly, why does no one seem to realize that this will then never actually end? We will constantly need more migrants, because we will constantly swear that we need more growth. This is not a viable long term economic plan, let alone the problems of overpopulation and all horrors that come forth from that.

&gt;I'm not too sure what you were trying to prove with your links

Not sure what links you are talking about. Most of my links you seem to ignore, and thus the very notion that I presented you with facts that undermine your idea of migrants overall being a load society can handle in social terms.

Having children isn't bad per se, having too many is bad, having migrants isn't bad per se, having literally 2% of your entire population in the span of one year without signs of slowing down, and with no actual real plan to assimilate them, is a huge problem.

The efficiency of the economy and by proxy also wellbeing of individuals is per capita. But this is also a mix of PPP and Nominal. Yes, food is more dependent on purchasing power in PPP, but technology is more dependent on Nominal. It's a real problem for how rampant intellectual property violation. There's a reason the Russians don't do anything about piracy because most Russians can't afford to buy media at market prices. €10 for Spotify for a Finn or Frenchman equals €30 (FX and salary level) for a Russian, so few would buy Spotify it even if it existed in Russia. 

Steam and other services have introduced cheaper pricing for Russia to combat this problem. But the Russian international purchasing power has almost halved since 2013, so platforms would now have to lower prices so much it simply isn't economical to operate in Russia in the short term.

5762,"Iran complied with the requirements of the deal according to everyone except the USA and Israel. So it couldn't really be sanctioned because there was no reason for it. Now the USA is free do to so.

I spent the larger part of last night watching political analysis about this and they all agreed that this is can easily be another Iraq situation. The USA backed out from the deal for bullshit reasons (even most Americans admit this) and will likely not make a new deal because in reality there wasn't anything wrong with the old one either. Instead, the most likely scenario will be to fabricate some reason which allows the USA to put more sanctions on Iran or fabricate a reason to go to war with Iran *before* it develops nuclear weapons.

With which they will destabilize the MENA yet again, as was it with Iraq, Lybia and Syria (just in the last 15 years). Iran is a particularly juicy target but the overall goal is still to destabilize the MENA as much as possible. The USA has a few allies in the region (Israel, KSA, Bahrain, UAE) and every other country is practically just a tool for ensuring that the region is permanently in chaos and not united. A fragmented region is much easier to control and suck out of resources. All the rest is collateral damage.

And as long as the public opinion in the USA is kept in check there was practically no downside either. The chaos is in the MENA, far from the USA and outside the terriotries of USA allies. The refugees are flooding Europe, Turkey and other ""disposable"" Arab countries.

Nationalization of all industries and the introduction of strict centralized management

State control of foreign trade

Strict discipline for workers, with strikes forbidden

Obligatory labor duty by non-working classes

Prodrazvyorstka – requisition of agricultural surplus (in excess of an absolute minimum) from peasants for centralized distribution among the remaining population

Rationing of food and most commodities, with centralized distribution in urban centers

Private enterprise banned

Military-style control of the railways


As soon as bolsheviks felt like there is no threat to their power, they started to wrap up NEP policies with the goal to replace them with dictatorship and absolute state control again

Lend\-Lease was a shot glass of help in the bucket of Soviet economy, it was most definitely aid but compared to UK Lend\-Lease it wasn't in the critical numbers. UK Lend\-Lease made up a HUGE chunk of their overall food, resources and arms. In USSR it was great aid to lower strain on certain industries and further increase the effectiveness of the war economy. Most resources imported were rarely above a few percent of what USSR was making already. In ultimate numbers, the one area where Soviet Lend\-Lease was arguably widely effective and made up a big contribution were trucks.

That said, Germany lost the war the moment they started, as it had no chances of winning any war of attrition, and would have led to success only if Peace with one of the sides was achieved. Germany was hoping for truce with west, it didn't came, and vastly underestimated USSR. Many put Germany on loosing side as early as 1942, around Battle of Moscow, only a bit over a year after war with USSR started \- Germany lost most of it elite troops and equipment to soviet conscripts and waves of cheap T\-34's, and it was a series of losses and retests from that point on.

5815,"1.	First of all, this whole thing was about wars in the EU- not outside of it. There has been no war inside the EU after WWII. And this is what all this is about, it’s a fact. If you want to discuss the involvment of EU members in wars elswhere in this world, then do it in a sub/thread that’s actually discussing that. “Whataboutism” is really not doing you any favor if you want to actually discuss a topic or maybe learn something...well, unless you’re actually not interested in that in the first place- then please, continue with whataboutism. 
2.	Well, who is “we”? I don’t remember ever seeing such a uniform European “we” regarding any issue ...at least not yet. While a good part of the population in the EU is against wars, you can’t just generalize and pretend that all people share your opinion. 
3.	Migration is basically human history, yes. But never in human history were so many people  this mobile and managed to travel so far in such a short time. So, your argument is void. Oh, btw....you might want to read through some pages of  “Global History and Migrations” ed. by Gungwu Wang- it might help. 
4.	It would also be of tremendous help if Russia stopped meddling in, or Turkey, or Iran, or Saudi-Arabia- directly and indirectly, these countries are just as involved (or even more involved) than any member of the European Union. You can blame the EU members involved, but then you should also blame every other country that’s only in Syria for its own interests....cherry picking won’t solve the issue, just shift the view from the whole picture to one aspect of it. 
5.	ahem, seems like the English language isn’t your best friend, eh? “You didn’t need justifications for war back then.(...)” - does not mean that “people”, as in peasants, started wars...nor does it imply that monarchs, or any other form of “leader/ruler” of past times, didn’t plan or start them....so your rebutall was kinda unnecessary as well.

It's obvious that the purpose of the EU law in such a situation would be to take actions to punish the American economy in response to an American decision to punish European companies.  There is no reason for anything other than a random selection of companies because the purpose of the law would be to deter American economic punishment of European companies and a random selection would serve that purpose perfectly well.  The EU would need no further justification, just as the US needs no further justification than the one it gives.  The comparison is a trade war, which is what this would essentially amount to.  In response to the US demanding global control over the actions of any EU company dealing with the US, the EU would respond by targeting US companies and meting out equivalent or greater economic damage to provide a penalty for the US behavior.  When the EU responds to US tariffs in one sector of the economy by imposing tariffs on denim and bourbon, the only criteria for choosing those targets are that it is perceived they will be the most harmful targets.",,/r/europe/comments/8hzwb2/us_ambassador_to_german_companies_stop_doing/dyouqx6/,Cryptoalt7,1525858530

Its simply the fall of the Weimarer Republic with a lot of subversive elements from all political directions dismantling the state leading to the coup bringing the NSDAP to power. 

This was an incredibly unstable time with a lot of people and groups being unhappy about the results of WW1. 

IMHO while there were some communist elements taking part, there where a lot of other elements in different parts of the country working for their interests with comparable intensity.

You are referring to the fight eastern front in WW 2 and the other side of the iron curtain during the cold war? 

Never forget: Germany was divided into a social-capitalist state in the west and a socialist state in the east. The western part made the states goal the reunification of Germany. Both where eagerly condemning the 3. Reich and all it stood for. 

Historically Germany has no overly negative attitude towards ideas from the left, but due to the post war policy on banning the results of the extreme right taking power we have a strong affinity against that side.

No *other* state or power like Russia, China, EU, etc. will replace the USA, it's just that the USA will have to become part of the one-world system.

The Pisa study showed that the performance of a school class significantly suffers when more than 40% of the students are no native speakers. Integration suffers and students stop using German as a common language and consequently fail to acquire it suffiently to be able to do well in class.

There was no enshrining or ratification by the other relevant US bodies like the Congress (Obama didn't take it to Congress because he knew they would not support it). Therefore realistically speaking the decision is only an executive one.

The Europeans can still trade certain goods with Iran. Even during the very worst sanctions European companies were still trading with Iran. The only thing is that if engage in an area that is covered by US sanctions violations they can be open to secondary sanctions. 

For example, if a European company helps Iran acquire missile technology, nuclear technology, etc. it would be open to US penalties. Another example would be if a European company is doing business with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp(designated as a terrorist organization by the USA), it can be open to penalties. 

Keep in mind, this is only the case if the European company does business in Iran AND the USA. If the European company has no business, assets, or involvement in the USA they can basically conduct all the business they want with Iran (as long as it doesn't violate EU law).
