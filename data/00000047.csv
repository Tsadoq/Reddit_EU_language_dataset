5,"First of all, the EU's Pfizer order was 200 million, not 300. That was a use of options exercised after the initial order. The CureVac order is massive in the sense that it is slightly bigger than that for Pfizer and was placed at the same time with a company that had not yet reached phase III trials and has seen extensive delays.

&gt; The EU (excluding UK) has about 440 M people, of which slightly less than 60 M people are below 18 years old.

Around 80 M are below 18. We are an aged continent but things are not that bad (yet).

&gt; Also I would not count CureVac out. A company only enters phase 3 if it is very confident of passing it. Sanofi discovered their problems in phase 2. It is therefore likely that CureVac will successfully complete phase 3.

I agree, plus CureVac uses the mRNA technology which has shown that it can be highly effective. That said, AstraZeneca also went to phase III trials, but the results were only moderately good, and they managed to have a dosing error and methodologically poor reporting to the level to which the FDA and EMA gave them the stink eye.

I agree with the rest of your post, I do think that the EU will find ways to cover for any additional shortfall. My problem, and that of many, is with the timing of new dosage arrivals. Timing is of the essence here. While lagging behind 2-3 weeks in vaccination benchmarks might not mean that much, controlling the pandemic 2 or 3 months slower than other developed countries risks bringing about both public ire and significant social and economic fallout, not to mention causing the deaths of additional people.",,/r/europe/comments/kodspl/biontech_criticises_eu_failure_to_order_enough/ghtdgi1/,Robi_damian,1609581997

What is it you’re trying to prove here? These are all just things you could easily verify if you wanted to. 

The land bridge is much faster but more expensive. The direct route is cheaper but takes longer. This is hardly some unusual situation. If the faster option was also cheaper the slow option wouldn’t last long.

47,"&gt; There is nothing nuclear about RT-PCR... 🤨
&gt; 
&gt; 

Not anymore, but it originally was. 

&gt; 1. Select a one-step RT-PCR kit, which should include a mix with reverse transcriptase and the PCR system such as Taq DNA Polymerase and a proofreading polymerase.




&gt; 2. Obtain all necessary materials, equipment and instruments (kits should include a detailed list of necessary items).



&gt; 3. Prepare a reaction mix, which will include dNTPs, primers, template RNA, necessary enzymes and a buffer solution.




&gt;  4. Add the mix to a PCR tube for each reaction. Then add the template RNA.



&gt; 5. Place PCR tubes in the thermal cycler to begin cycling. The first cycle is reverse transcription to synthesize cDNA. The second cycle is initial denaturation. During this cycle reverse transcriptase is inactivated. The next 40 to 50 cycles are the **amplification program**, which consists of three steps: (1) denaturation, (2) annealing, (3) elongation.



&gt; 6.  The RT-PCR products can then be analyzed with gel electrophoresis.[48][49]

According to your source the amplification cycles alone cost **61 minutes**. 

So 45 minutes is just impossible, and the whole process will indeed take several hours as mentioned by the other sources. 

It should be noted that this is the RT-PCR, which is also known as the 'quick test'. Regular PCR testing (which are the standard) take longer than this.",Koninkrijk der Nederlanden,/r/europe/comments/ko8hd2/turkish_scientists_say_theyve_developed_a/ghte15g/,GloinGleckal,1609582625

83,"Austria has already adopted an obligatory imam registry among other measures aimed at reducing terrorism after a November terror attack in Vienna.

Since the start of 2021, Austria has required the registration of all imams in the country.

The mandate was one of several new measures Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's government adopted after a November 2 terror attack in Vienna. Four civilians were killed and 23 injured after a 20-year-old gunman opened fire in the center of the Austrian capital.

Now Austria is calling for the European Union to adopt the registration of imams, the worship leaders of Mosques in Muslim communities.

**Why is Austria calling for EU imam registration?**

In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt published Saturday, Austria's Minister for European Affairs Karoline Edtstadler said Imam registration was key for ""the fight against political Islam.""

""Most imams move through many EU countries, so the security authorities need to know who is preaching what in which mosque at any given time,"" Edtstadler, a member of Kurz's conservative Austrian People's Party, told the newspaper.

She also believes EU funds should be ""so strictly controlled in the future that they do not go to organizations and associations that advocate Islamist and anti-Semitic positions."" A ban on foreign financing for mosques, which is already in place in Austria, is also conceivable, she said.

To fight terrorism, Edstadler would like to see ""further improvements in cooperation and data exchange between the judicial and security authorities of the [EU] member states.""

EU interior ministers have declared a new ""war on terrorism"" after the Vienna attack and similar atrocities in Paris and Nice in France.

**Austria's new anti-terror measures**

The registration of Imams, which the Islamic Religious Community in Austria (IGGÖ) has been tasked with maintaining, is one of a host of measures Austria has adopted in the wake of the Vienna attack.

The government has expanded a ban on symbols associated with extremist organizations to include the far-right nationalist Austrian Identitarian Movement as well as Islamist groups.

Criminal law has been changed to include a ""religiously motivated extremist association"" offense. This includes anyone who threatens ""democratic constitutional order ... with a social and state order based exclusively on religion in an unlawful manner.""

Release conferences have been created to be held before the conditional release of imprisoned terrorism offenders. The sessions are intended to provide courts with the necessary information so they can impose appropriate conditions on released offenders.

A registry of terrorism offenders has been established. The list is designed to impose a lifelong ban on weapons purchases and prevent previous offenders from being employed in security-critical areas.

The Austrian government did stop short of an explicit ban on ""political Islam,"" or religiously motivated political extremism.

Kurz's administration also wants to revoke the Austrian passports of convicted terrorists if they possess other citizenships, but a draft law to that end is not expected until later this year.",Dalmatia,/r/europe/comments/kovbby/austria_calls_for_european_register_of_muslim/ghteko9/,ManusTheVantablack,1609583211

Between 1949 and 1983, the term was synonymous with Commonwealth citizen. Currently, it refers to people possessing a class of British nationality largely granted under limited circumstances to those connected with Ireland or British India born before 1949.

&gt;In countries such as Iceland, Argentina, Bulgaria, Albania or Moldova, this Tampon Tax is 20% or higher. Women in Bosnia, Turkey, New Zealand, South Africa, and Chile pay between 15 – 19% VAT to purchase the sanitary products they need.

Most countries have decided to reduce this VAT in recent years, albeit in line with the EU’s minimum rate. Among these countries are Spain, Greece and Austria, with a tax of 10% or greater on sanitary products. Also in this group are France, with a 5.5% tax, the UK, with 5%

214,"Unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the AZ vaccine does not come with severe logistical challenges. Administering two million doses per week should be doable. The main question with the AZ vaccine is whether it provides sufficient protection, especially for those most likely to get seriously ill, such as old people. 

Unfortunately, the AZ Phase III trials were a hot mess. Normally, Phase I and Phase II are used to figure out the dosage and the time gap between separate doses. AZ Phase III trials used a four weeks time gap between doses. A vaccination schedule of two full doses with 2-3 months between doses was not tested in Phase III. I don't think they have any data on old people being vaccinated with two doses three months apart. The UK trial which started early enrolled only 3.6% participants over the age of 75. The more comprehensive US trial started recruiting volunteers only on August 31. 

This doesn't mean this approach is an auto-fail, there is logic behind it. But with vaccines there is a significant risk that theoretical considerations don't hold up in reality. Those Phase III trials aren't just some red tape, they are necessary. 

To fight a pandemic, some corners might be cut, because doing nothing will definitely lead to many deaths, never mind the damage to the economy. But that does not imply that cutting corners will work. 

&gt; So around 25 Million by March if my fag packet sums add up. That could be everyone over 45, or everyone over 55 and those with health problems (more likely). 

That's one dose per person. Not two doses. How good again is the protection provided by one dose of the AZ vaccine, for people age 80+? What actual data have they shown on that? Data for people 80+, that is, not data for people age 18-55. 

&gt; The UK will have virtually no deaths by March 

No way. People don't just drop dead when they get infected. Median from infection to first symptoms is 5-6 days, and median from first symptoms to death is about 18-19 days, for a total of 23-25 days from infection to death. Again, that's the median.

I'm so fucking sick of being told I was lied to. The reason Remain lost was because of this absolute lack of empathy. This inability to consider that maybe, just maybe, different people have different values and priorities.

I wanted to Leave because I wanted to end FoM, I wanted an end to ECJ and EU Parliament oversight, I wanted Britain to forge it's own path in terms of international trade, I believed that Britain can prosper more mightily away from the bureaucracy of the EU, I value sovereignty over GDP, and because I didn't believe any of the project fear lies from the Remain side.

FoM has ended. The ECJ and EU Parliament have no power over the UK. We have over 60 trade deals already. We got the vaccine out quicker than the EU did with their botched scheme. We have regained control of our laws, waters, and borders, and Westminster is once again the highest law in the land.

OK lets do.
I've literally compiled every single goddamn source I could find for any claim I've made on this thread and this is the result.
I've given a sort description of what its all about and you'll find all the answers here. IF any link is not working then pls mention it and I'll provide another.
If the link is not containing the answers you've hoped for then please list your questions I'm 99% sure we'll find the answer in these sources.

Archieving the PCA(Paris Climate Agreement)-Goals much earlier:

Renewables are either cheaper than fossil fuels or on par with fossil fuel:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148118301526?via%3Dihub

we cant wait for renewables, they need to come asap:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319396014_The_underestimated_potential_of_solar_energy_to_mitigate_climate_change

we need to get rid of fossil fuels asap without any additional emissions:

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0091-3

We have a ultimate limit we need to avoid in order to prevent global chaos:

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1269

We only have 9 years to become Co2 neutral. If we dont, Point of no Return-scenario kicks in.
meaning that coal-usage until 2038 is a catastrophe:

Merkel wants to keep coal-energy going until 2038:

If you still think renewables with todays tech's impossible, the german government thought it was and they put their own climate goals. But they failed to meet them...total embarassment. Reasons for the failure I'll mention in a bit:

https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/treibhausgasemissionen-101.html

https://www.zeit.de/zustimmung?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeit.de%2Fpolitik%2Fdeutschland%2F2019-02%2Fklimaschutzbericht-ziele-2020-immissionen-klimawandel

Merkel put a fullstop on Frances effort against climate change. International efforts are tried to be minimized by germanys cancellor:

https://www.merkur.de/politik/merkel-auf-eu-gipfel-in-sibiu-rumaenien-europa-muss-geeint-auftreten-zr-12266323.html

Heres part of an interview of multiple scientists and doctors (goddamn EXPERTS) who reveal that the only reason for germanys push against renewables is conflict of interests and corruption:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=243&amp;v=dGow4VDa6V0&amp;feature=youtu.be

Heres proof of many high-ranked CDU (merkels party) politicians and how they were offered more than +60.000€ to +100.000€ and they took the money. RWE spend YEARS lobbying this way and its also due to that that the Renewables took so long:

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWE-Aff%C3%A4re


https://lobbypedia.de/wiki/RWE#2015:_Nebeneink.C3.BCnfte_des_NRW-Landtagsabgeordneten_Golland_.28CDU.29

https://www.ksta.de/region/rhein-erft/cdu-politiker-gregor-golland-bis-zu-120-000-euro-im-jahr-fuer-halbtagsjob-bei-rwe-25267646?cb=1609550686477

https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nebeneinkuenfte-rwe-sponsert-ueber-hundert-kommunalpolitiker-a-336686.html

And as a ""thank you"" to the coal-industry, the CDU politicians fought to make taxpayers money flow into the pockets of the coal-industry because they cant hold themselves above the water. We literally spend millions on the destruction of our climate this way:

https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/teure-steinkohle-der-kampf-um-subventionen.976.de.html?dram:article_id=436329

https://www.wupperinst.org/p/wi/p/s/pd/29/

The Subsidization of coal energy is factually a debt-yielding bussiness:

https://www.bundestag.de/resource/blob/505892/0a3577d00633e51547e8b148f2d58e01/wd-5-033-17-pdf-data.pdf

https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/klimawandel-wir-schuetzen-die-profiteure-der-katastrophe-a-1264618.html

With the current course of germany and the CDU we will absolutely fail to meet the PCA goals and instead of reaching 1.5°C we're heading for 3°C. Meaning that we're gonna be past the point of no return and we'll go extinct as a result:

https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf


But now lets get into the real meat on what we can do to stop climate change!

Tax for Co2 emissions! The CDU was the only party(Aside from the nazi-parties) who actively argued against this kind of tax, but since the green party rose more and more with each year they eventually agreed:

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.461.4081&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0201-2

Carbon pricing is a very effective way of reducing Co2. Many many organizations as well as 40 countries in the world have embraced the idea:

https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon

Great Britain also has carbon-pricing and it reduced their Co2 emissions immensely:

https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-carbon-emissions-in-2017-fell-to-levels-last-seen-in-1890

CDU is vehemently against carbon-pricing:

https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-beerdigt-co2-steuer-vorschlag-aus-klimapapier-gestrichen-a-1265634.html

""We need to increase the climate-protective efforts by 5 times the current speed,now!"" says a scientist in an initiative of over 26.000 german speaking scientists:

https://scientists4future.org/

15.000 international scientists also urge for action. From germany too:

https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/12/1026/4605229

The direction the CDU is heading will inevitably destroy the future if they intend to continue like that:

https://www.umweltrat.de/SharedDocs/Kurzmeldungen/DE/2016_2020/2018_06_Umweltziele_Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie.html?nn=9724688

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/1259855

https://www.nature.com/news/three-years-to-safeguard-our-climate-1.22201

German government blatantly ignores the warning of experts:

472,"I know that its easier to have an ally for a short time to defeat a common enemy, but we must not join the monsters just because we have the same goal.

I mean, we all have the same goal, a better future for us and the world.

But HOW we archieve these goals is important.

Sure you could do it like hitler and unite the whole world under a single flag, but you'd be killing trillions in the process.
That, in hitlers eyes, were visions of a bright future.


""They'd not allow us to join""
Thats not true.
Believe it or not but there was a time when turkey was actually considered to join the EU.
Back then erdogan was still a lower-ranked politician and the country had been stabilized for a while, but europe was almost certainly letting turkey in.

But then issues with cyprus happened and since the EU works on the unanimity principle the talks were put on hold but turkey was still a strong candidate.

North mazedonia is in the same position right now.
They have very recently applied to be in the EU but because bosnia(or bulgaria I dont remember) doesnt acknowledge their land the talks were put on hold.

But the EU said that talks will continue later and that north mazedonia has a high likelyhood of being accepted.

If turkey hadnt become an autocracy and if erdogan hadnt been so fiendly, talks with turkey about joining the EU still would have continued.

Right now the talks with turkey have completely stopped.
Right now the status is that turkeys joining into the EU has stopped, but it hasnt been rejected yet.

So theres still hope. If turkey wants to get in into the european goodness they will have to change.

Or at least erdogan will have to change.

And regarding erdogan, I never liked him.
Not back then, not today.
Even his policies are dogshit today.
Back then he did what any sane president would do.
Build hospitals and improve infrastructure. 
But that was it. There was nothing else that he did. 
I bet hospitals and more roads could've been done by other presidents as well.
Heck I could do it if I became president, thats no difficult tasks.

After all he is not the one who builds the roads. He's just the one that TELLS people to build roads.

If you still think renewables with todays tech's impossible, the german government thought it was and they put their own climate goals. But they failed to meet them...total embarassment. Reasons for the failure I'll mention in a bit:

https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/treibhausgasemissionen-101.html

https://www.zeit.de/zustimmung?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeit.de%2Fpolitik%2Fdeutschland%2F2019-02%2Fklimaschutzbericht-ziele-2020-immissionen-klimawandel

Merkel put a fullstop on Frances effort against climate change. International efforts are tried to be minimized by germanys cancellor:

https://www.merkur.de/politik/merkel-auf-eu-gipfel-in-sibiu-rumaenien-europa-muss-geeint-auftreten-zr-12266323.html

Heres part of an interview of multiple scientists and doctors (goddamn EXPERTS) who reveal that the only reason for germanys push against renewables is conflict of interests and corruption:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=243&amp;v=dGow4VDa6V0&amp;feature=youtu.be

Heres proof of many high-ranked CDU (merkels party) politicians and how they were offered more than +60.000€ to +100.000€ and they took the money. RWE spend YEARS lobbying this way and its also due to that that the Renewables took so long:

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWE-Aff%C3%A4re

https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nebeneinkuenfte-rwe-sponsert-ueber-hundert-kommunalpolitiker-a-336686.html

And as a ""thank you"" to the coal-industry, the CDU politicians fought to make taxpayers money flow into the pockets of the coal-industry because they cant hold themselves above the water. We literally spend millions on the destruction of our climate this way:

https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/teure-steinkohle-der-kampf-um-subventionen.976.de.html?dram:article_id=436329

https://www.wupperinst.org/p/wi/p/s/pd/29/

The Subsidization of coal energy is factually a debt-yielding bussiness:

https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/klimawandel-wir-schuetzen-die-profiteure-der-katastrophe-a-1264618.html

With the current course of germany and the CDU we will absolutely fail to meet the PCA goals and instead of reaching 1.5°C we're heading for 3°C. Meaning that we're gonna be past the point of no return and we'll go extinct as a result:

https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf


But now lets get into the real meat on what we can do to stop climate change!

Tax for Co2 emissions! The CDU was the only party(Aside from the nazi-parties) who actively argued against this kind of tax, but since the green party rose more and more with each year they eventually agreed:

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.461.4081&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0201-2

Carbon pricing is a very effective way of reducing Co2. Many many organizations as well as 40 countries in the world have embraced the idea:

https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon

Great Britain also has carbon-pricing and it reduced their Co2 emissions immensely:

https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-carbon-emissions-in-2017-fell-to-levels-last-seen-in-1890

CDU is vehemently against carbon-pricing:

https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-beerdigt-co2-steuer-vorschlag-aus-klimapapier-gestrichen-a-1265634.html

""We need to increase the climate-protective efforts by 5 times the current speed,now!"" says a scientist in an initiative of over 26.000 german speaking scientists:

https://scientists4future.org/

15.000 international scientists also urge for action. From germany too:

https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/12/1026/4605229

The direction the CDU is heading will inevitably destroy the future if they intend to continue like that:

531,"&gt; Would that coalition alignment include FDP just because there's no one else left, or are they in any sense a natural or constructive partner for SPD or Greens? I have this impression that FDP is kind of right-ideologically hardcore on 'free markets' and not really gaining much interest or sympathy for that for a long time.

Well if the parties in question would get their shit together it should include the Left instead ofFDP but I'm just kind of pessimistic in that regard. The FDP makes sense in a centrist coalition without the CDU. They are kind of hardcore on the free market stuff but they try to market themselves as pragmatic makers and I think they are kind of ideologically flexible in the end. They declined a coalition with the CDU last time around. I think they see a better chance to up their profile in a coalition without the CDU. They have been fighting to stay relevant this entire decade and they've been struggling to differentiate themselves from the CDU and AfD which is why I think they'll probably see signalling openness to other coalitions as the way forward. 

That being said it's not a match in heaven. It would be kind of akin to your crazy geriatric-hippy uncle who may or may not recently have gotten his act together, your half-senile grandpa who fought as a partisan in WWII and your cousin who stuided buisness in London trying to clean up the house that your grandma who pretends she's doing just fine has neglected for the last decade or so.

We were one of the countries most affected with the crisis, almost none European companies showed any interest in our companies, at the time, it was all that we had to do in order to survive that period (don't forget that these countries were able to take positions in Portuguese strategic companies because the EU prevented investments from the state). We went with who was interested, for the most part it was China and Angola, they were the ones that showed any interest. 

Having said that, because of allegedly malpractices, not so long ago, the CEO of the biggest electricity company (with Chinese investments) was forced to resign, I think that shows we are nobodies puppet. Almost all the Angolan investments are now in dire straits because of the Isabel dos Santos meltdown.

Also, we were the first western country to have established direct trade relations with Asian countries, Macau was ruled by Portugal for centuries and that is why we have a respectful relation with China.

646,"&gt;Why fight a powerful country when you can cross the sea and have a land  with a ton of resources for a very low cost compared to a war ?

Lol, if it were that easy, then France would have done that. Both England and France started colonization of North America at the near exact same time in the early 1600s.

When the Spanish colonized Latin America, it was profitable because the Spanish discovered a ton of gold and silver in Central and South America.

There was no gold or silver in North America. The early English and French colonies did not have a ton of resources and were not very successful. That's why so few French people emigrated to North America, because you can't build an empire on fur trapping. The only reason why so many British people migrated were mainly religious reasons and because emigration of religious minority protestant sects was encouraged by the government. It took well over a century before the colonies in North America became profitable self-sustaining entities.

I guess it is when people are older and think ""What if something happens to me or the other part?"" and they want to make sure they have everything on legal terms to allow them to inherit stuff (de facto union, which is what we have and not really a civil union where you go to the notary sign papers, doesn't make people heirs of each other in the case one of them dies).",,/r/europe/comments/kobys4/eu_live_births_outside_marriage/ghr6pk0/,idontevenwhatever,1609531675

&gt; In April 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan considered invoking Article 5 of the NATO treaty to protect Turkish national security in a dispute over the Syrian Civil War.[19][20] The alliance responded quickly and a spokesperson said the alliance was ""monitoring the situation very closely and will continue to do so"" and ""takes it very seriously protecting its members.""[21] On 17 April, Turkey said it would raise the issue quietly in the next NATO ministerial meeting.[22] On 29 April, the Syrian foreign ministry wrote that it had received Erdoğan's message, which he had repeated a few days before, loud and clear.[23] On 25 June, the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister said that he intended to raise Article 5[24] at a specially-convened NATO meeting[25] because of the downing of an ""unarmed"" Turkish military jet which was ""13 sea miles"" from Syria over ""international waters"" on a ""solo mission to test domestic radar systems"".[26] A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman insisted that the plane was ""flying at an altitude of 100 meters inside the Syrian airspace in a clear breach of Syrian sovereignty"" and that the ""jet was shot down by anti-aircraft fire,"" the bullets of which ""only have a range of 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles)"" rather than by radar-guided missile.[27] On 5 August, Erdoğan stated, ""The tomb of Suleyman Shah [in Syria] and the land surrounding it is our territory. We cannot ignore any unfavorable act against that monument, as it would be an attack on our territory, as well as an attack on NATO land... Everyone knows his duty, and will continue to do what is necessary.""[28] NATO Secretary-General Rasmussen later said in advance of the October 2012 ministerial meeting that the alliance was prepared to defend Turkey, and acknowledged that this border dispute concerned the alliance, but underlined the alliance's hesitancy over a possible intervention: ""A military intervention can have unpredicted repercussions. Let me be very clear. We have no intention to interfere militarily [at present with Syria].""[29] On 27 March 2014, recordings were released on YouTube[30] of a conversation purportedly involving then Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu, then National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan, and Deputy Chief of General Staff General Yaşar Güler. The recording has been reported as being probably recorded at Davutoğlu's office at the Foreign Ministry on 13 March.[31] Transcripts of the conversation reveal that as well as exploring the options for Turkish forces engaging in false flag operations inside Syria, the meeting involved a discussion about using the threat to the tomb as an excuse for Turkey to intervene militarily inside Syria. Davutoğlu stated that Erdoğan told him that he saw the threat to the tomb as an ""opportunity"".",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/ko3gxd/sweden_edges_closer_to_nato_membership/ghr70ir/,Ampersand55,1609531828

As an expat living in EU for a long time, I see it as a bad decision fueled by blind jingoism and (criminally) misleading politicians using it for their own personal benefit. I truly don’t believe that the UK citizens have been given a truthful and factual evaluation of the consequences, on which to decide and vote.

However, I did live in a relatively deprived area of the UK into which citizens from other EU countries were migrating en-masse, taking jobs, claiming social security etc and so fully understand the frustrations on which those politicians played.

When did I ever say that? How about not arming anyone? How about fighting yourself instead of letting other people fight for you? Especially when it involves you arming terrorists WHO ALREADY TERRORIZED YOU with weapons?

I'm just saying that turkey should stay neutral and not join either side.
Instead they should send their army and european armies to fight both organizations.

It should be easy to convince the EU since it already acknowledges the pkk and isis as terrorist organizations.
Turkey just needs good relations to the EU.
Meaning that turkey should stop trashtalking the EU.

872,"&gt;literally indistinguishable except in name

Can't do for very obvious reasons. For example, certain Slavic languages put an -ova suffix at the end of the wife's name. This wouldn't work with same-sex couples. Same in Hungarian with the -né suffix (optional, but naturally this option is disallowed for same-sex registered civil unions).

&gt;do gays deserve the right to a legal union the same as straights?

As a legal relation between two consenting adults, why not? I'm not that knowledgeable on non-Hungarian legislation, but Hungarian legislation on registered civil unions expressly invokes the provisions on marriage.

NB adoption does not only pertain the two consenting adults wishing to adopt.

&gt;The state is there to act as the advocate for the child.

More precisely, to safeguard the rights and the best interests of the child (usually, since the New York Convention is rather popular).

Now, is a state allowed to hold that the *best interests* of the child would, where the child's adoption becomes necessary/possible, be better served by being raised by a heterosexual couple rather than a homosexual couple, all other thing being equal?

So far only the relation *between* the two partner was being evaluated. Are the child's rights and interests a mere dependence of whatever is going on between the couple raising him/her?

&gt;should the child, who is usually too young to talk coherently, be asked what kind of parents they want?

Never said Kurds are Native,only Used Older Sources to prove that Kurds had an large and old-ish Presence in these Regions.


&gt;Please stop using wrong translations, a century old claims.

Wrong Translations how?  


&gt;Nationalism should stay away from history, because it influences people and they don't manage to objectively read it.


what Nationlism? None of My Sources are made by Nationalist Kurds if that's what you're implying.


&gt;The Kardak, the Kartu and all those people were not Kurdish, they were native Anatolian groups. 


the Kardak and Kurti were not Anatolian native appearntly,Qarti or Qartas, were *originally* settled on the mountains north of Mesopotamia,and are considered as a probable ancestor of the Kurds.

In 1923, English Orientalist Sir Godfrey Rolles Driver published a scientific research article ""The Name Kurd and Its Philological Connexions"". Driver, who was also an Assyriologist had tried to find who was the Qurti who had lived around the lake Van and with whom Assyrian warrior Tiglath-Pileser ""I had fought"" in ~1050 BC.  Driver also tried to find the connection between Qurti and ""the land of Karda"" [Kardaka] text which was written on a Sumerian clay-tablet, of the third millennium B.C. Sumerians called the area around Lake Van a land of Karda. Driver examined the philological variations of Karda in different languages, such as Cordueni, Gordyeni, Kordyoui, Karduchi, Kardueni, Qardu, Kardaye, Qardawaye. He realized that all these names were actually the conversions of ""Karda"" in different languages. Also, he managed to connect all these names to the same area, Lake Van in contemporary Kurdistan.

The word ""Kurti"" for the most part is from Sumerian and means: ""kur"" meaning mountain or hil, and ""Ti"" meaning ""from"",that concludes to  ""the people from the mountains/hills.""

The word/term ""Kurti"" is probably the oldest known word which describes the Kurds from 3rd millennium B.C.E.

For the most part, it's very likely that the Karduchians were the Ancestors of Kurds,the Syriacs kept calling the Kurds as ""Kurtaye"" and used terms like ""Beth Kurdaye"" (land Of Kurds) etc,for Example,A Little History :

Theophobos or Nassir,an İranian under The Service Of Theophilus,Was also Called an ""Kurdanye"",Which pretty much Meant ""Kurdish/Kurd"",both Bar Hebraeus and Michael the Syrian noted that he was Kurdish.

&gt;And he sent [an order] to 'ABU SA'ID to make raids in one direction, and to BASHIR, the Satrap, and the sons of the desert, to do the same in another direction. And whilst BASHIR was raiding, NASIR and the KURDS overtook him and delivered the captives. Then came 'ABU SA'ID, and the ARABS gained the upper hand, and they killed NASIR and many of the KURDAYE...

&gt;Bésir s'empara de beaucoup de troupeaux et de gens; il fut rejoint par Naçr, chef des Khourdanayé, qui délivra les captifs romains. Abou Sa'id arriva. En le voyant, Naçr faiblit; Bésir le tua et fit mettre sa tête au bout d'une lance. Quand les Khourdanayé virent que leur chef avait été tué, ils n'envisagèrent plus que la mort: ils descendirent de leurs chevaux, leur coupèrent les nerfs et combattirent à pied jusqu'à ce qu'ils succombasent.""

&gt; Disagree here, especially Apple devices have absolutely ludicrous ""usable life"" times.

Anything prior to 2015 or so is no longer supported. Recent macs are terrible for programming because they are too locked down. You're not even allowed to attach an unsigned debugger to a process, let alone mess with kernel modules :)

&gt; Humans have developed tools for millennia to make their lives easier, so why should we force pupils to live in the past instead of enjoying the possibilities of modern technology?

941,"As for the Sharafkhan Part, it's Complete Bullshit,First off,Sharafkhan isn't the First Kurdish Historian, that'd either be [Baha Ad-din] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baha_ad-Din_ibn_Shaddad) From 1145 CE,or [Mustafawi] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Mustawfi) in 1169 or basically other earlier Kurdish Historians.


Second of all,all that oghuz khagan stuff is mythology,medieval kings claimed descent from prophet david,muslim rulers made up genealogies that said they were of prophet muhammad's lineage,ottomans made up genealogies to legitimise themselves as descendants of one of the mythological tribes of turks,taking those as solid historical facts is just a laughable bad attempt at history.

Third of all, Whatever Bull-shit stated there was not Claimed by Sharafkhan or in his Book Sharafnama, Nowhere does he state any of that,Plus, Sharafkhan didn't write Kurds are Turks,Or Persian,or Arabic,He stated that the Kurdish dialect in Amed has been corrupted over time,The nationalist and one of the theorist for ""Turkish power"", [Ziya Gokalp] (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/780526263693475860/791428524677791825/unknown.png) was the one using that line to claim that """"Kurds are Turks"", Ironically enough Ziya Gokalp himself was of Zaza Kurdish Descent.


&gt;The Mugab Turkmens were also called Ekrad (Kurds). 


straight up bullshit,it's usually the opposite on the turkmen-ekrad thing,the turkmen groups were commonly called türkmen ekradı meaning turkmen kurds,turkmen designates a way to live rather than an ethnic marker and turkmen basically means one who lives like a turk.

basically every nomadic group who gained its living by maraduing and living a pastoral life,was called as ""turkmen* by ottomans.

ottomans called everyone who came from Kurdistan,Armenia,or northern syria etc all as ""Turkmen"" Because of the fact that when ottomans conquered those places,they were run by turkmen-turk dynasties predominantly,so everyone from there was basically called as ""Turkmens"".

For some Period even,turkmen was also used to designate alevi-shia people because of the Safavids.

As far i know all of these were Mentioned by an Armenian Turkish Linguist and Historian in His Blogpost,which was in Turkish,his name was Sevan Nişanyan i think.


&gt;To the name Kurd. Arabic sources used the term Guzu'l Ekrad, meaning Oghuz Kurds for nomadic Oghuz tribes. Ottoman archives call nomadic Turkmen groups in Eastern Anatolia ""Kurdish Turkmens"" or the Kurds of the Turkmens.  Istahri talks about the Khalac Turks as Ekrads (Kurds). Minorksy writes that nomadic Arabs were called Kurds of Sistan and nomadic Daylamites were called Kurds of Tabaristan, nomadic Turkmens were called Ekradu Turkmen, meaning Kurdish Turkmens.


Lmao,this is even more absurd than the Last Sentences, Obviously this bullshit is spewed by Turkish Sources,there is not an single shred of Reliablity in what you stated.

&gt; It takes around 12 hours which is why results take so long to be issued.

&gt; [...]

&gt; “LAMP” (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) tests uses a swab to collect material from the throat and nose but this is not processed in a thermal cycler. It produces many more viral RNA copies without the need to heat and cool – a constant temperature is used. The samples are then placed in vials of reagents (substances that produce a chemical reaction to detect the RNA), then heated in a special machine for 20 minutes. The sample is analysed to confirm the presence or not of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

&gt; A LAMP test can be processed within a couple of hours.

&gt; **There are worries that this method is not as accurate as a PCR test and false positives and false negatives can happen. Some say a second LAMP test should be taken to ensure accuracy.

My mum, who support the right of gay people to marry and adopt, is still against it being called marriage, cause she feels that marriage is what she has with my dad and she doesn't want the definition to change. 

Another reason is that everyone seems to have stories of people who grew up with only one parent.

1181,"Funnily enough I just posted this comment on another thread: 

Scotland voted in favour of staying in the EU in the Brexit referendum in 2016. This was shortly after the Scottish Independence referendum in 2014 where Scotland voted to stay as part of the uk - at the time the campaign put a lot of focus on the idea that an independent Scotland wouldn’t be part of the EU and that was cited by a lot of people as being as their motivation for voting. Scotland was also promised a lot more autonomy for the Scottish Parliament which didn’t appear and in fact Westminster seem to be doing what they can to minimise its power.

Yes, Scotland chose to be part of the union but it has become increasingly clear in the last 40 or so years that the electorate here is politically different from England - the conservatives consistently poll around 15% here as opposed to around 40% nationwide and Scotland voted labour for years before the rise of the SNP in the last decade but we’ve had years of right wing governments and horrible austerity foisted upon us by English voters which we’ve often borne the worst of. Brexit has also emboldened a kind of British nationalism which we don’t see ourselves in.

So, that’s a long way of saying: things have changed.

Yes, the EU is not perfect but a lot of the things that it does protect (worker’s rights are going to be the first thing to get cut, just you watch) are important and we don’t trust a right wing conservative government because we’ve seen them act against our interests time and again.

Support for remaining in the UK has been steadily falling with the last couple of polls putting it under 40%. There’s an election in Scotland this year which is likely to deliver a pro independence parliament which Sturgeon has said will give mandate for a referendum. Westminster have also said they won’t allow that to happen so that could get messy. EU membership is likely to be a big part of the debate there.

This comment is going to get me shouted at by English people so I’ll just add: you know in Hamilton when king George pops up and makes sarcastic comments about how these silly colonials think they can do without him and everyone laughs at him?

For one, there's an argument to be made that positive rights cannot exist, and as such you cannot recognize one to exist. 

Then there's an argument that could also be brought up that governments should not be able to decide what is or what isn't allowed in a relationship, and as such, should not be able to determine who can marry and who cannot.

Then, of course, there's the religious part of it, which has been misapropriated by governments, but generally speaking marriage is conducted by a minister, and whether or not someone can get married is up to that person, or the creed. Take Catholics, if the Pope deems it appropriate, it is appropriate.

US Leadership of a bunch of countries that provide minimal capability and refuse to increase their capability is a drag on their power, not a boon. The US cannot unilaterally allow countries in so NATO accession for Georgia or Ukraine requires all countries in NATO to agree; unlikely to happen.

A EU-army would be interesting but seems unlikely. Even for security crises like Turkey-Greece or Libya the EU cannot act in unison diplomatically or with sanctions. Who would provide the capabilities the US provides?

1599,"So, the reason that we have the dispute over military spending is because national defense (well, within one country, but it's not a huge deviation to add countries) is a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics\)), and when you have a public good, the [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem) emerges -- for any one individual member, there is incentive to spend less, since it creates a relatively-small proportional decrease in overall spending relative to the benefit they receive by being able to keep the funds.

But there's another side to that.  Public goods are [non-rival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics\)) -- that is, one person benefiting from it doesn't stop someone else from benefiting from it.  They don't ""use up"" the good, preventing another member from benefiting from it.

So adding a country to NATO doesn't really cause more people to ""consume"" what resources are put into it.  That is, starting a fight with a NATO country still involves.

The issue with NATO members not meeting spending commitments is real -- you have to have some way of dealing with the free-rider problem for public goods, else you get economically-inefficient under-allocation of resources.  One country spends less, another country spends less, and so forth.  But it's not really a problem that adding members exacerbates.

Now, okay, that's not *completely* true.  The incentive to free-ride increases the smaller the proportion any one member is of the population -- which is why the US (budget is a large portion of NATO, decreasing it would affect the US a lot) doesn't have a lot of incentive to free-ride, and Luxembourg does (decreasing the military budget would have very little effect on  Luxembourg, at least defensively).  So it does slightly exacerbate that.

And because we're talking countries and not individuals within a country, national defense isn't quite a public good, because it *is* at least partly [excludable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability), and public goods are non-excludable.  That is, the US Army cannot choose to defend me but not my next-door neighbor -- it's all or nothing.  That's a public good.  But NATO *could* choose not to defend Sweden or Finland, just draw the line at Norway.  The issues with excludability that NATO sees tend to be more ""you can't realistically defend Poland without also defending Germany"".",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ko3gxd/sweden_edges_closer_to_nato_membership/ghodbkz/,duisThias,1609476328

1615,"Shifting the goalposts,eh? Setting aside the facts those are estimates,we are talking about the workplace here. Just to throw back your petty numbers about domestic and Intimate abuse,have this,sauced from  the Partner Abuse State of Knowledge and the Partner Abuse Worldwide publications :

From 2010 to 2012, scholars of domestic violence from the U.S., Canada and the U.K. assembled The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge, a research database covering 1700 peer-reviewed studies, the largest of its kind. Among its findings:[62]

More women (23%) than men (19.3%) have been assaulted at least once in their lifetime.
Rates of female-perpetrated violence are higher than male-perpetrated (28.3% vs. 21.6%).
Male and female IPV are perpetrated from similar motives.
Studies comparing men and women in the power/control motive have mixed results overall.
A 2013 review examined studies from five continents and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered towards women as victims.

The only pathetic thing to bring to the table is intimate and relationship abuse,when you know very,very well that men tend to not report any of it,swipe it under the rug,or downplay it severely either due to fear of judgement,law enforcement outright not believing them,or simply out of personal pride.

Imagine believing i compared ACTUAL,documented and persecuted abuse,to wearing shorts. You absolute clown. I compared 'feeling' threatened (which means very little,and has a far too broad definition to be even quantified) by a man in the workplace to being offloaded extra work,thrown under the bus,or restricted in what you can say,wear or do in the workplace by a/multiple women,which are all things that hamper one's ability to feel at ease and work comfortably inside a workplace.

But please,do keep going on tangents,shifting goalposts,and bringing up data that ONLY serves your personal point,conveniently cutting out the other side of the argument because it would make you look bad :)

1940,"Thanks for correcting me. In Russia ""central heating"" has the same meaning as ""district heating"" in other parts of the world. Might be due to historical reasons (after industrial revolution the majority of people were living in apartments, not homes). I remember one of my ex-coworkers telling me that they use district heating in Utrecht. Oh, yes, found one warmtekrachtcentrale there.

For some reason, in my mind ""boiler"" was a water heater with a tank, and ""water heater"" was just a tankless water heater. Funny enough, in Canada they usually have a separate boiler (for water heating) and a furnace (for air heating, that then gets distributed through a house via air ducts – so called ""forced air""). And by ""central heating"" they usually mean a furnace.

There are a lot of townhouses (row-houses) in Amsterdam and Hilversum, the new ones should have really good energielabel. Should be a nice compromise between a house and an apartment/condo.",,/r/europe/comments/knlu2f/an_insane_explosion_happened_right_across_the/ghmyf7m/,MutableLambda,1609445507

&gt;  
&gt;COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a series of two doses (0.3 mL each) **at least 21 days apart** 

In case it wasn't clear that it was the CHM:  


&gt;**Additional updates relating to use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine**  
&gt;  
&gt;The CHM has also reviewed further data for the [Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19) as it has become available and has recommended the following changes:  
&gt;  
&gt;Pregnancy and women who are breastfeeding - the vaccine should only be considered for use in pregnancy when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and baby. Women should discuss the benefits and risks of having the vaccine with their healthcare professional and reach a joint decision based on individual circumstances. Women who are breastfeeding can also be given the vaccine. This advice is in line with pregnancy and breastfeeding advice for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine  
&gt;  
&gt;Allergies - anyone with a previous history of allergic reactions to the ingredients of the vaccine should not receive it, but those with any other allergies such as a food allergy can now have the vaccine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dosage interval - the advice has been updated to say that the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine should be given at least 21 days after the first dose.

2155,"What does 2021 hold for the European Union? At the end of 2020 Brussels has gone out of its way to engage in unity-signalling, announcing that all 27 members will begin vaccination on the same day and feigning a united front in the face of the UK’s new strain of coronavirus. But in truth its 27 member states are confronted by serious structural divisions in three fundamental areas: economics, culture, defence.

Deep economic divisions surfaced in the EU after the 2008 financial crash along a north-south axis. The split between the richer ‘frugal’ northern economies and the ‘profligate’ southerners was starkest in 2012-13 over Brussels’ treatment of Greece. Papered over at the time, the structural economic weaknesses of the so-called ‘Club Med’ of Greece, Spain, Italy, even France, erupted again with coronavirus. Financing economic protection against the pandemic and re-launching individual economies was feasible for the northern states, but fiscally perilous for the southerners, who were among the most indebted countries in the developed world. By June 2020, according to EU statistics, Greece’s national debt to annual GDP ratio stood at 187.4 per cent, Italy 149.4 per cent, Portugal 126.1 per cent, France 114.1 per cent. The battle to mutualise a small part of the debt has again pushed to one side the fundamental structural problem with the EU, the Euro: undervalued for some (Germany and the northern states) and overvalued for others (Italy and the southern states).

A 2019 German think tank report, entitled ‘20 Years of the Euro; Winners and Losers’, costed the single currency’s impact on individual states. From 1999 to 2017, only Germany and the Netherlands were serious winners with the former gaining a huge € 1.9 trillion, or around €23,000 per inhabitant. In all other states analysed the Euro has provoked a drop in prosperity, with France losing a massive €3.6 trillion and Italy €4.3 trillion. French losses amount to €56,000 per capita and for Italians €74,000. Without fundamental reform the nineteen-member single currency’s divide between high-debt, high-unemployment southern states and their low-debt, low-unemployment northern counterparts will widen. The next crisis will come as the ECB’s quantitative easing programme ends and southern debt ceases to be sucked up by the Bank.

Structural fissures are also opening from east to west in the philosophical and cultural underpinnings of the EU project. Hungary and Poland’s vetoing of the EU’s €1.8 trillion budget and recovery package brought a cultural war into the open. Eastern states took issue with Brussels’ political requirement for the fund’s distribution to be tied to adherence to the ‘rule of law’. They already felt aggrieved by western member states’ imposition of their one-size-fits-all ‘progressive’ values on their states. During the 2015 migration crisis their ‘regression’ to national borders and refusal to take migrants, followed by restrictions on the role of the media and the judiciary, irritated western leaders insistent that such practices contravene EU values. Eastern leaders rightly point to their policies being popular and supported by strong democratic mandates in recent elections. Whatever the respective merits, Brussels’ cultural hegemony risks drawing a new Iron Curtain across the EU, not to mention that many of these states preserve their national currencies.

The EU’s divisions on defence are deep-seated and longstanding. By declaring Nato ‘brain dead’ last year, president Macron hoped to frighten Europe into seriously instituting its own defence. He restated that policy on 16 November sparking a feud with Germany. The German defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, directly contradicted the French president by insisting that Europe must continue to rely on US security guarantees. AKK doubled down on statements from October declaring that ‘illusions of European strategic autonomy must come to an end’ because ‘Europeans will not be able to replace America’s crucial role as a security provider.’ She called for a reality check: ‘Without the nuclear and conventional capabilities of the U.S., Germany and Europe cannot protect themselves. These are the sobering facts’.

The EU dividing line is between supporters of Nato as the primary European defence arm and those who militate for an autonomous European army. Before Brexit, Britain invariably spoke up for Nato and criticised a European army, usually against France’s advocacy of it. Without Britain’s cover Germany has had to put its head above the parapet and thus come into direct confrontation with France. Diminished status for Nato in EU defence and Brexit could both further divide EU members also along an east-west axis. Nato and Britain provide military protection for the Baltic states against potential Russian aggression. But with Macron much in favour of closer relations with Russia, eastern and central European states are fearful that French or Italian militaries might not be able or willing to defend the Baltic states, a scenario alluded to in November by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

The founding father of the European project, Jean Monnet claimed: ‘Europe will be made from its crises and will be the sum of the solutions found for those crises’. If true, given what is brewing, the EU may be on the cusp of a great leap forward. But Monnet was referring to a six-member club; twenty-seven may be a crisis too far.",,/r/europe/comments/knsqis/the_eu_is_a_divided_house/ghm71qc/,casualphilosopher1,1609431235

2179,"Hmmmm, Let's call this a teaching opportunity ...

Let's do our percentages first.
From gov.uk forn2018 Scotland's total exports are 85bn of which the UK accounts for  51.2bn. 51.2 is 60.24% of 85. You get that by dividing the 51.2 by 88 and multiply the result by 100. 

Now comparative percentage.
You say that Scotland tipped the UK out of the EU by its ""40%"" of its vote that voted leave. You see that doesn't work like that because you have to take the 60% that voted to stay into account. When you do that you'll see that on the balance Scotland tried to tip the UK to remain. (Ps. The actual vote was 38 leave 62 remain).

Now the history of colonies and the 15bn deficit.
Every region in the UK runs a deficit except London and the SE. NI, Wales, the North East and West; EVERY ONE OF THEM. This is the nature of colonial Govt. The capital makes the money to the detriment of the regions. 
So would Scotland would be worse off immediately after leaving. Yes. But once they take back control of their borders and their laws they can chart their own economic future (sound familiar?). 

As for the Bundeswehr.
I can only presume this is some tired throwback to WWII when D-Day Dawson was giving Fritz a good old blighty pasting. Aren't y'all over that yet?

As for the Tommy Robinson like reference to mass migration ... can you imagine what it's like to see your identity destroyed by an alien culture. The Scots can, they call it Culloden.

And as for the Pound Sterling. The Scots will get to keep Sterling. So what'll England call it after the Freedom of Albion (2027)? The Pound Scunthorpe?

there is one obvious answer.

The EU knows China will not adhere to any promises without being forced to. Forcing them is easier if the EU and US form a common position.

However, what is this common position?

While it is preferable for both Europeans and Americans to work together, the Americans are hard negotiators. Thus the stronger the EU's individual position, the more a common EU-US position will reflect European interests.

They capped us off with the BLM protest and summer riots saying all black people lives were in danger from police and caused massive riots and lives lost that they then swept under the rug which lead to the biggest increase in murders in the past 20 years in the country. Most major cities have seen 30-50% increase in murders since those protest to save black lives. Under The Biden admin all will be good because they’ll ignore every story possible like they did under Obama. When the laptop issue came out they hurried the story and refused to cover saying it was Russian propaganda then after the election his son is actually being investigated by the FBI since 2018 and year many people in this country still don’t know. Most people in the US don’t even know about Lybia and Obama having a Nobel peace prize winner killed. Because the media never reported about it but they would have 24/7 coverage about Trump having 2 scoops of ice cream or him being rude. It was all manufactured chaos to drive up ratings and get their ultimate goal of removing Trump because he made people despise the media more than they ever had before.

A Greek aid mission sent to Croatia in response to the country's devastating earthquake arrived on Wednesday, state-run news agency ANA-MPA reported.

The aid package includes tents, sleeping bags, blankets, sheets, heaters and other essential items for the people left homeless by the quake.

The tremor claimed seven lives and has caused extensive damage, according to news reports.

The Greek mission was the first among EU member-states to reach Zagreb, following Croatia's request for aid via the European Civil Protection Mechanism.

2416,"It ain't particularly difficult to solve, no, but with high volumes, complex road work involving multiple traffic categories and increased traffic member interaction, it's important that clarity and consistency is increased to ensure that people can quickly build understanding.

They've made some great strides recently, but there's still problems. I cycled from Egmond aan Zee to Amsterdam central a few years ago, and clarity definitely dropped rapidly as soon as I went into the grachtengordel, with barrier height decreasing (even being flush with the road in some cases), red colour disappearing, cycle path crossings not always being indicated clearly with white paint, and the big obvious white cycle paint being replaced with these tiny tiles that I don't believe you see anywhere else in the country. I suppose that Amsterdam cycling is designed for the people that live there and get to know which roads to avoid and which routes are dedicated to cyclists. But not everyone knows and so you still get places where you can technically cycle and so people do, but where it's not exactly ideal for anyone.

When pedestrian traffic and cyclist count increases, these two categories should really be segregated for everyone's benefit, and though most cities have done this, Amsterdam just kind of has sidestepped this, e.g. by declaring most of the grachtengordel a ""shared space"" for all three categories.",,/r/europe/comments/kn9kw8/biking_around_in_amsterdam/ghlep6c/,jernau_morat_gurgeh,1609409329

\-Housing market is FUBAR, cheapest rent within 5km of my uni is literally €1100/month.

\-The Belastingdienst \[Tax collecting institute thingy\] has become incredibly mean and cruel, and they will treat you as a criminal for a honest mistake. More and more instances of poor people being bullied are appearing. (The 'Toeslagenaffaire' is just one of many; think also about the €7000 fine for the poor woman who got groceries from her mother, the dude who got a €500 fine and a criminal record for forgetting to declare a €100 gift, etc.)

\-The average company makes more money. The average employee does not.

\-Universities have more students to handle, but have one bilion less euros to do so \[Miljard in Dutch\]. For each starter academic job (junior researcher) there are about 30-40 people trying to get that job; most don't get it.

\-Relatedly, studying has become more expensive so the trend is that less children of poor parents study. This is worrying IMHO.

\-The recent Corona cockup.

\-Many protests are ignored and get fined if they go too far, but the darn farmers can destroy a gov building in Groningen, can destroy bicycle paths throughout province Utrecht, can destroy the surroundings of the RIVM and threaten them, but they get away with a 'sure we will reduce the nitrogen-oxide limits'.

***Why the fck are poor people to be mistreated, but farmers to be protected?!***

\-Can't think of many more at this point, I didn't prepare this.

I used to vote D66 since I like things to be more nuanced, but I'm honestly becoming more left the more the fcking VVD grows.

2659,"&gt; Go and check up the vaccination plans, imports, deals and datelines if you're so inclined. 

I aleeady did. Chile has bought enough doses from Pfizer for maybe 30% of the country and enough doses from the dubious *Sinovac* for perhaps another 30%. The other 40% are still not settled, but the government is currently negotiating with *another Chinese maker of a dubious vaccine*, as well as *Russia*. 

So we can expect the 30% from Pfizer to go to the well-to-do and the other 70%, which is the cheap and unproven stuff, to go to the poor public health system.

&gt; Spoiler for you: Most of the country is to be vaccinated already by May 2021.

Had it been left to run around unchecked, there would have been much more of it and it would have spread to younger and younger people - until we would have had lockdowns.

However, by that time, there would have been much more damage in economically active people than it is now. That would have been trading the short term gain for long term loss.

At best, the anti lockdown people are making an **unbelievably** wild and uneducated guess - and by a crazy turnaround of circumstances, they guessed right. Kinda like winning lotto.

Russia's most advanced node is a Mikron 65nm one that's only possible via equipment supplied mainly by EU companies and a technology licensing agreement with ST Microelectronics (French/Italian). Their most advanced home grown CPU is also Elbrus 8S which is fabbed on an older 28nm process in Taiwan (TSMC).             
            
There is no intention to create an EU Intel, most of the EU's investment in the area has been to decrease reliance on foreign technology, mainly American. It's imperative to have European alternatives to US technology, especially since the US has been very trigger happy with their trade bans in the past couple of years.    
Of course those trade bans mainly targeted China, but they did send a pretty strong message that we can't rely on others for crucial sectors like automotive or HPC.          
              
Producing DRAM or NAND isn't a small task and there's little need to do that here since they are commodities.       
Most of the EU semiconductor industry is specialized on R&amp;D (ASML, IMEC, CEA-Leti, Fraunhofer Society, etc.), which is a pretty good place to be since a lot of foreign companies are dependent on us. For example there would be no cutting edge nodes without ASML's EUV machines, TMSC, Samsung and Intel need them to enable sub 10/7nm nodes.

2780,"You wrote a lot- and I do not want to think that it was wasted. 

Your first point means nothing. It is normal and even expected for a nations media to rally against foreign power- it just feels weird to you as European to see it from America because of this weird act of “friendship”. From economic principle, EU was no different from China. 

Second point, people absolutely lambasted USA for allowing China to be in WTO, and USAs increasing trade with China under Clinton. Now, as for your point on why there are no media reaction to trade deal with US with regard to human rights- European media is free to do so. Why they do not has no bearing on biases of American media. 

Third point, British media does seem a bit more “consertivative” leaning because of the tabloid popularity and I can give in to the fact that French media may be as much self critical of its country- but there is absolutely no way you could with a stright face tell me german media is the same. Half of German media is feeling smugly superior to Anglo world. I cannot deny you your experience but in the entire European continent, I think any normal person would say only France is as viciously critical of itself as much as Anglo world.

On Iraq: you are absolutely wrong. Like flat out wrong. Again, I admit that media is mostly opinion- but this geopolitics of 2003 Iraq is not. Iraq genuinely was the strongest power in the Middle East. It did not have WMD, but it was conventionally in the top 5 strongest nations world wide. There is a Chinese report, I can link it if I get to my laptop- made in that year about how China itself evaluated Iraq as being stronger than it- and how surprised the Chinese leadership were when Iraq folded like a tin can after US invasion. 

Iraq didn’t just fight a post revolutionary Iraq, Iraq fought a Iran that had black check from US just 1 year ago. Iran had top 5 strongest Air Force and believe it or not, better fighter jets than Britain. Iran was cleared to buy more weapons than Britain or Israel in the days of the shah. The world supported Iraq is a lie too. The Iran contra showed Iran was being helped by US on procuring weapons- as well as Israel was on Iran’s side for most of the war. 

Iraq in 2003 was not same as 1981. But- it had still amazing army with 8 years of battle experience. Iraq being a defence less 3 rd world country is a very stupid way of looking at why Iraq war was insane. They pushed WMD because Iraq- how ever strong it was- and it was strong- was still not match for as you said, USA, UK, Etc. 

As for last point- I am not arguing if US media is un biased. So that is a moot point.",,/r/europe/comments/kmoznc/eu_prepares_to_betray_itself_with_china_trade_deal/ghkxfof/,JoeWelburg,1609393267

Also, you have a Polish provinical flag? Lockdown? Poland closed hotels, ski slopes, gyms, cinemas and non essential stores, but only in shopping malls. That's not a lockdown. Those are much lighter restrictions than basically anything else. The only lockdown, where all of these, are considered ""essential"":


- any shop outside of a shopping center


- a tattoo parlor


- a hairdresser


- or, well... Ikea?


So Poland seems to be trying to find a balance between restrictions and economy like nobody else, restricting less. Not sure it's going well as Polish numbers per 100k are bad.

The large caliber were gone, so were all medical kits. The rapid response warehouse, that had consistently had thousands of Russian variants of AKs and combat ready equipment was cleaned up before the first looters got there. 3 months later, sufficient armament to equip an army, from small caliber to towed artillery ( I am perplexed how someone loots a howitzer), showed up on Kosovo.

3107,"&gt; Italian has 7 finite inflectional verb forms, not including imperative. Then you are forgetting that the conjugational forms are 6*3=18, because the suffixes are different for verbs in the three conjugations (verbs whose infinite form end in -are, -ere and -ire).

Fine, it has 4 indicative forms, 1 conditional, 2 subjunctive. Then it has 3 conjugations. 

Despite this, the number doesn't actually matter since it pales in comparison with all the information that is required to learn the actual ""grammar"" of a language. 

&gt;Anyway, now you are saying, it's more difficult, not much more difficult.

No I'm not. The language feature you deem ""verb conjugation"" in Italian requires more information to acquire and use in speech than the language feature you deem ""verb conjugation"" in English, which are really completely different language features that happen to share enough history and superficial similarity that we lump under the same heading.

It's practically impossible in many areas already, because they can just offer everything for cheaper than the local manufacturers here, which means they go blank (and maybe get bought up by them) or instead focus on different markets, making us more and more dependent on them and their products.        

&gt;You also said, if you traded with Nazi Germany a country became nazi. Well, if you say ""a country becomes like the country they trade with""  

That isn't what I said, that is what you keep repeating over and over again, because of whatever logical fallacy you felt for when you did not comprehend that ignoring or supporting an atrocity makes you complicit.  

&gt;That is why I don't think nazi Germany was supporting democracy by trading with democracies. When Hitler traded with Canada, it was not that Hitler was like ""let me fight for true passion, democracy, with this trade!"".  

JFC, if we support China's economy by buying their slave labor products, then we're supporting them. We are giving that regime money to continue to do what they are doing instead of punishing them for that.

Unsurprisingly everyone loved it. It spread into the future empire, somehow it got named ljubljanska despite being made in koper, and when the empire split, it remained as a traditional recipe in some cities in Italy, Slovenia and Hungary, with lots of regional variations.

Anyways, let me give it a try!

Firstly, you are very correct to address every time I misuse a word or place it somewhere incorrectly, and I'm very grateful that you are doing it (despite the rather bitter remark :P);
Secondly, I'm aware of the meaning of the word ""pidgin"", and I also know that it doesn't apply to the American case. Yet, in order to magnify the bitterness with which I refer to the English language, I preferred to keep using that specific word. 
As for the ""last modern issues"" you have reported, I thought people in general would be aware of the fact that Esperanto is criticized for topics such as
- genre (nouns and other constructs are always declined starting from the masculine form)
- very strict grammar rules that many judge to be inefficient, but that the Esperanto institution (academy?) won't reform them
- introduction of new words/slang terms from other languages instead of deriving them from the artificial roots, and so on.

Regarding your last statement instead, I am no expert in matter, but in my years of studying languages, English among them, I have formed the opinion that my previously stated arguments are true; should you provide counter arguments or evidence that contradicts my findings, please do share. 
Just one last thing: I used to do the same with learners that were on a lower level than me, but then I discovered that disregarding others' opinions just by judging their use of the language doesn't make you better. If you didn't understand what I wrote, then please notify me, otherwise hit me with some real good arguments, not judgements.",,/r/europe/comments/kmziy2/english_could_be_ditched_as_official_language_of/ghirr6a/,GeeNoP,1609352260

3382,"Good question. They used the Dutch guilder until 1940, but during the German occupation they decoupled from the European Dutch guilder and coupled to the USD. After that it became known as the Antilian Guilder.

They sustained this to this day, so it always had a fixed value versus the dollar (they changed it once in 1971). 

With legal reforms of the islands (collapse of the Netherlands Antilles, referendum and formation of 3 separate constituent states instead of 1 and 3 special municipalities) they all kind a went their own way with the currency. If you want to know why, just see Brexit. The islands were all kind of a Farage against the big bad Antilles led by Curagermoney. 

I suspect they prefer the USD because most of their trade and tourism is dollar denominated, and keeping their own currency without fluctations doesn't economically offer any advantage. 

Curacao and Sint-Maarten still use the Antilian Guilder, which they want to replace with the Caribbean Guilder which would have a 1:1 conversion to the USD. Although the economic council of the kingdom has advised them to switch to the dollar. 

Aruba uses the Aruban forint. So these 3 islands have their own currency.

&gt;On the EU side, further work will now be undertaken in accordance with its legal rules and procedure to sign, ratify and conclude the Agreement. The two sides will aim to conclude negotiations on investment protection within two years of the signature of CAI.

&gt;Ensuring successful implementation of this Agreement once concluded will require high level and sustained political engagement with China. The Agreement also provides for a robust enforcement and monitoring mechanism .The European Commission will monitor the implementation of the commitments in the Agreement on the EU's side.

&gt;The EU will take stock of the overall development of EU-China relations, including but not limited to the CAI and its implementation in all its dimensions, during the French Presidency in 2022.

In either case, it has definitely worsened EU-US relations as the Americans preferred either no deal or at the very least for the EU to wait until Biden was in place to create better coordination on China policy.

You have these examples as forced assimilation.Like saying that balkans were lucky to have ottomans.

Nobody knew about the diseases they didn't use them as weapons intentionally, it just happened.Aztec would fall anyway by the spanish either with or without the disease or local support.

The slavery and being a second class citizen in your own country was a only win for ottomans.When nationalism became a thing in turkey they started extreme practices too.A lot of regions during late stages of the ottoman empire banned languages except turkish and started  forcing islam.The peak was the pontic and Armenian genocide.My great grandpa lived in the black sea region and was part of it.He lived it.

How stupid you are to believe that they did that out of their good hearts.In retrospective forcing everyone to become muslim would be the obvious thing because more muslims=more stability but during that era wasn't.Nationalism wasn't a thing.Who would the empire milk now.Or take their children?

How can you make an accidental mistake about the islands multiple times?You said the SAME fucking thing over and over and over again.

And imia were not populated by greeks.Or anyone.Just a crisis.Which both nations pulled off after intervention from above.It was just the first step of turkey denying.

The muslims that leave there are such a small minority that its not important even locally.They are less than 3% which are remanents of an islamic caliphate.They will eventually assimilate back.

You seriously ask me why nobody trust media from a country that has the most jailed journalists after china?You really want me to pointe oute what exactly?

As for immigrants you literally push them in the greek borders by lying to them at now you play the mortality card?Greece doesn't want them.Simple as a that.Turkey use them as a leverage against Greece and EU.Nothing to be proud of.

Aegean will never be shared 50/50 unless greece loses a war.But turks are not stupid enough to attempt that.

""Why nobody likes us, why they hate us?We only want half of their things.It must be nationalist greeks""

This poll is more recent, plus seems more accurate  considering most of your comments are being buried.

Anyway, it's complicated, and it's unlikely you'll ever see communism as a bad thing because you are clearly biased and lean pretty far to the left. To give you credit, you have tried to make dialogue and find common ground with people, when the vast majority of people holding your views on reddit, don't even attempt to talk to someone right of center or in the center. Either way, personally, as full of faults as liberal democracies are, I would absolutely not accept a Communist form of government. Command economy is just a net bad, when the government owns all the land, when there is no form of class, when wealth is redistributed over and over. That is bound to collapse, given time.

I'm not Romanian, and not familiar with the Romanian regime, maybe they were an anomaly, maybe they did Communism right, but I highly doubt it considering this thread is full of people denouncing it. You can make the argument that in a wealthier country it would work, I still disagree, it came to power in dramatic fashion in the historically, and arguably currently wealthiest country on the planet, and while the people do seem to be happy, they have a lower quality of life then the average Liberal/Social Democracy, their leader is trying to challenge a global superpower, they not even a year ago crushed a revolt in Hong Kong, they support one of the biggest humanitarian crisis in the post-Vietnam era.

You can argue back and forth on this subject, you can look at the past, and lust over it, or you can look at the present, and I don't know what you see, but I see the countries that can balance capitalism and socialism, are far and away much more prosperous then those who are pure capitalist or pure socialist.

Yes. It was under monarchy that we gained our independence, It was under monarchy that we modernize and industrialize (at least by those times standards) and most importantly, it was under monarchy that the Great Union happened.




And especially since monarchy was followed by a Stalinist regime. Hell in the 90s when Ceaușescu fell, monarchism was at an all time high. Hence why the royal family was not allowed to return  by the neo-communists in charge.

And you are literally advocating for the genocide of old people. See, we can both do an ad absurdum and ""win"" the argument. Fact of the matter is, there's two options, do online classes or do in person classes. Online classes lead to less deaths but are less efficient at educating people. If online classes are chosen, more people will fail at the same difficulty, hence, to not ruin kids lifes it might be better to just lower the difficulty for the duration of online classes. If people are lacking behind after in person classes resume, extend their curriculum for half a year or so. This way nobody is left behind and people should achieve the same education level in the end. Or you know, do in person classes and let poor people be absolutely ravashed by the economical consequences of prolonged shutdowns.

&gt;You do realize many parents are living paycheck to paycheck and dont have those type of devices to be used by their children right?

I live in a first world country. Parents get about 140(2x70) euros specifically for school utensils per kid per year, that should pay for a cheap tablet and is I think a lot cheaper than all the extra costs related to sending your kid to school in a normal year.

Greece's military preparation is fully defensive, which is why in the past when Greece-Turkey relations are good, military spending is decreased, foreign policy focus is spent elsewhere and even national service time is decreased.

Yes Greeks had influence in Anatolia and Greece that is undeniable and were living there for a few 1000 of years which makes the area even today Greek influential but Ottomans only had a few centuries time to build and make it's influence I think that's what you mean isn't it? As for the what you call ""forced populated"" Islands I didn't mean it something like that lol, you just understand things just like I'm insulting something like you are doing. I was talking about Islands near the Turkish mainland being populated which leads Greece to have the right by the UN to make the research area of oil and gas 95% it's own while Turkey also has a large Aegean coast to the Aegean ( it's one of the things that is heating the relationship between Turkey and Greece up and the Greek government didn't make a thing about it which could benefit both of the nation's but you misunderstood me. ). *Promoting Islamic culture as benefit* what do you mean by that? Building mosque's or like you said ""using the Ottoman slavery for it's benefit""? Building religious places is something every natuo does. And about the slavery instead of doing what the Spanish did to the Aztecs or what the French did to the Algerians the Ottomans used it's own slavery which benefitted him by either making the non-islamic states convert to Islam ( with the devshirma and extra taxes ) or benefittin the devshirma and extra taxes which is a win-win situation for the Ottomans. It was not actually benefitting from the religion but a slavery to make people convert to Islam. Imagine the Papal States in that time owning Jerusalem and not genociding Muslims living there in Jerusalem in the first crusade but giving people freedom of religion in exchange for them paying extra tax to him and giving their children to become either soldiers with the religion of the state which are going to have the same life capabilities as a normal citizen ( even marrying local woman of there ) after their serve for the state or become a Pasha or minister etc... If they are capable of it. Ottoman architecture was influential in the modern Turkey since it was directly ruled by us and was seen as our motherland.  Just like Greece building it's most influential buildings in modern Greece and Turkey since those places were their motherland instead of building them in modern Spain ( they only built religious places there which can be seen as the Hellenic mosque or Church so it's the same as Andalusia building there a Mosque.) Long story short, We built our most influential buildings in Istanbul instead of Greece since Greece wasn't Ottoman motherland. Edit: I've read your comment again and no I don't even watch TRT lol and after that I checked out TRT and they aren't propagandising anything just like you thing ( you misunderstood what I meant anyways ).

Back to the topic at hand. What the EU needs to remain or be relevant is actual power in the EU parliament as the sole governing institution. Until such a time as decisions are taken out of heads of state or the parliament is a play thing for behind the scenes intrigue that reduce it to a pseudo ceremonial organisation we’re stuck in this endless loop of waiting, seeing and going from crisis to crisis.

I think the european parliament is useless anyways so we could just cut it out for simplicity without losing much.

What we COULD do is to let the european council be the political head of the EU like how it is now, but instead of having parties vote for the council, we vote them ourselves and instead of having to take into account many differing constitutions we could sit on one table and figure out a humanely unified constitution.

And as a german I also think we should make charity for political parties illegal, mainly because parties are being corrupted under the ruse of  ""lobbying"".
And if the politicians are paid by taxpayers anyway, why would they need the money from companies?
But maybe thats just me.

The idea of a european state or the USE isnt that far off.
In germany around 46% of the people were all for a unified european state and 2% were undecided.
So the people arent that much against the idea, its just the details that concerns the most people.",,/r/europe/comments/kmkqs6/euchina_investment_deal_done/ghg4h1l/,Buttsuit69,1609287739

I mean the whole EU deal is proportional to population (for each vaccine) and as for when, they get what amounts it's dependent on the vaccination capacity, the amount of people that want to vaccinate etc. I mean my country despite being rather large will only have less than a million vaccines till the end of January. And the main problem the government now has, is wondering if they have storage and if enough of the sadly reluctant population will want to be vaccinated fast, as most seem to want to, but, not in the ""first wave"". So maybe Germany is for some reason sure their population will vaccinate? Maybe if they don't it will be made mandatory? Maybe they have huge -80C storage capabilities, as for many places it's the issue that in lesser temperatures the expiration date comes rather fast. I mean the article answers non of such questions, and surely if Germany hogged vaccines and made them expire, this would cause a scandal, so maybe we should wait and see if that happens? Also, the adding the Straslund incident as ""citizens also injected with five times the recommended dosage"" when this is about 1 hospital and depending on source 5-8 people makes me view the article as DailyMail/Bild style, despite supposedly being on a market related portal. And less but not least, I live in Poland, yeah, you know the place, where parts of the population, among them the current government need very very little to hate on Germany.

4185,"&gt;They'll form a government with the Labour Party if the next election goes the way it looks like right now, possibly with the Socialist Left party as well but they seem a bit cold towards them the past years.

Sounds a lot like its gonna be like our Swedish Government then, or well at least if your Social Democratic party (The Labour Party) and Centre party is as bad as ours. Our Social Democrats still have people striving to keep pushing for the unsuccessful policies of yesterday while some of them wanna walk the same path as Denmark althoughthey remain unsuccessful in doing that so. While our Centre party is ready to light our welfare state on fire any chance they get and beat workers rights back to the 19th century. A match made in heaven... 

&gt;I doubt they'll fall in popularity that much until the election, barring some truly major scandal or happening. Most Norwegians are rather sick of the conservative led government (especially their centralisation policies which has pissed off people living outside the cities), and this seems to hold despite the popularity with their mostly successful corona-policies

Yeah you never know what's lurking behind every door. The future is yet to come so until then we truely dont know how it'll end up. Like I dont think anyone expected to read about our Prime Minister breaking his own governments covid recommendations 2 days after he himself held the press conference about it, today. Most political commentators have already said it'll cost him dearly so this might be the hill he'll die on, who knows. A lot of Swedes are tired of the current government and yet they remain in majority in polls although the Liberals and the Environment party is on the edge of the cliff or in the liberals case already at the bottom. Who knows if they survive another election but if they dont that will tip the scale in favour of the conservative block of parties M, KD and SD. 

&gt;However Labour isn't as attractive as they used to be, and parties to the left of them are too socialist for most people. With the other centrist parties now camping with the Conservative government, SP remains the most appealing opposition party for swing voters.

Yeah, dont you guys have a marxist party in Stortinget? Albeit with like 2.5% of the votes but still? Yeah we dont have a party swing voters are most appealed by here in Sweden.

Are you saying there were no compromises of your sovereignty with your latest trade deal with the EU?

&gt;In the EU, sovereignty isn't just simply ""shared"", it is partially given up to a central government.

I think this is a glass half-empty half-full argument.

I agree that EU's common foreign policy is lacking, but that doesn't mean individual states can't act on their own. The recent East Med crisis is a good example.

The USA can have the high ground in there ""trade war"" with China but don't forget that all they have done is putting presure on China to negociate a better commercial balance with them.

I also agree that Uyghurs concentration camp are one of the most horrific thing of the 21st century, but what leverage do we have? As much as I hate to admit it, we are highly dependent on China and if something as to happen they have all the card in hand to put pressure on us.

There's plenty of things member states can do on their own and other things they have to follow a common ground on. That's what being part of a group or organized society means.

Yes but don't you still have to compromise on your sovereignty in order to get an advantage on your trade?

When you are in a rural village and the nearest police station is one hour away by car trough mountainous roads, you better have something to defend yourself.

There's a reason why thieves avoid going wild in those areas. Police presence protects both citizens and crooks. If someone tries to steal from a farmer or anyone in a remote village, he will probably get shot and buried in the mountain forgotten by everyone.

And that's why i fully support legal ownership of weapons for people living more than 30 minutes away by car of the nearest police station if having clear record and go trough psychological and aptitude tests.

Thats a problem though, as the culture of Europeans is a lot closer to the UK compared to Asia. In addition the well-paid, well-educated jobs are not really a problem - but who is going to do the underpaid jobs that nobody is going to do without creating a major cultural problem?

&gt; If Brexit has already done it’s damage to the UK economy then it’s been almost meaningless, the amount of jobs that have left has been minuscule, London is still the financial center and certain extremely large companies like Unilever have moved in. 

Obviously the UK isn't going to explode or sink because of Brexit. That was not the point i was trying to make though. More like the following qote: ""The U.K. government estimated that Brexit would lower the U.K.’s growth by 6.7% over 15 years. That’s if there is a trade agreement but restrictions on immigration."" (Random google source: https://www.thebalance.com/brexit-consequences-4062999 )

4506,"&gt;The Great Mosque of Paris has decided to withdraw from the project of the National Council of Imams. It denounces the harmful influence in the negotiations of an Islamist fringe of the French Council of Muslim Culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a hard blow to a flagship project, announced after the assassination of Samuel Paty.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rector of the Great Mosque of Paris (GMP) announced on Monday, December 28 that he would withdraw from the project of the National Council of Imams (CNI), wanted by the Elysée and entrusted to the French Council of Muslim Culture (CFCM), denouncing the influence of ""the Islamist component"" within the CFCM.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I have decided (...) to no longer participate in the meetings that aim to implement the project of the National Council of Imams and to freeze all contacts with the entire Islamic component of the CFCM,"" wrote the rector, Chems-Eddine Hafiz, in a statement. This is an ""irrevocable"" decision, he says.   
&gt;  
&gt;The project of a National Council of Imams (CNI) charged with certifying their training in France was pushed insistently by the Elysée in the framework of its bill against radical Islam and ""separatism"". The creation of such a body, often evoked but never concretized, had been formally requested by Emmanuel Macron during his speech at Les Mureaux (Yvelines) presenting his strategy of struggle against ""separatisms"" at the beginning of October.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pressure to better frame French Islam had increased with the assassination of Samuel Paty and the Nice bombing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Lack of representativeness**   
&gt;  
&gt;This project has been entrusted to the CFCM, its main interlocutor on questions of organization of the Muslim faith in France. The CNI must deliver an approval to the imams according to their knowledge and their commitment to respect a code of ethics. The nine federations of mosques that make up the CFCM, which is regularly criticized for its lack of representativeness, were first to agree in early December on a ""charter of republican values"".   
&gt;  
&gt;""Unfortunately, the Islamist component within the CFCM, especially that linked to foreign regimes hostile to France, insidiously blocked the negotiations by almost systematically calling into question certain important passages"" of the charter, criticized the rector of the Great Mosque of Paris.   
&gt;  
&gt;Members of the Islamist movement"" would have made believe ""that this charter had the ambition to touch the dignity of the Muslim faithful"", details Chems-Eddine Hafiz. It is ""a shameless lie"", he denounces.  ""I believe that the representation of Muslims deserves something else (...) than dubious actions surrounded by actions that seek to divide the national community and to separate French Muslims from their society,"" he wrote.  
&gt;  
&gt;Already at the beginning of December, a dozen figures of reformed Islam had denounced the role granted by the State to the CFCM for the creation of the CNI, describing it as a ""fragile institution"".",France,/r/europe/comments/kmh0tm/project_of_the_national_council_of_imams_the/ghehgfz/,Ra75b,1609257978

4545,"And just to compare, The marker wadden cost only 75 million to make, and are only 800 hectare to maasvlakte2's 2000, the rest is currently just aspirational. None of them will need to be able to carry any significant structures, while the maasvlakte2 is larger, costs 3 billion to be completed, and had to be structurally strong and stable enough for large industry. The latter is a far more major project.

The noordoost polder was  part of the overal mega project designed to make a new province and *was done before the flevopolder and not after* which was one of the criteria you numbskull. You have yet to make a case why using the more readily available data on islands is somehow wrong, or why theu would be in a materially different category for comparison. (Hint: they're not) Hell even you keep using them for comparison here.

The construction effort of creating a part of land out of water is quite simular whether it's unattached or partly attached. So if smaller islands count as major projects, so would a larger partly attached reclamation. The bigger variables is actually other factors such for example as depth and wether it's in the sea or a lake. 

For fucks sake. You're really just grasping at straws here for no fucking reason. What is causing you to flip out at the idea that maasvlakte2 is clearly a major reclamation project that the dutch undertook after the flevopolder? It really seems that you just took a position randomly and are just committed to ignorally defending that position whatever the cost.

Than I am more concern why maternity leave is paid only for 16 weeks- for how long you can have maternity leave in total, included unpaid, than? Is financial support is tied to previous income, or is it flat rate?

For a fathers leave: is it paid based on their earnings, or it is just flat rate same for all? Social security, including job security,  has a lot of with mandatory leave, when you have more than one child, I would doubt for example we would be able to decide on having more than 2 maybe, as it will affect in that case career prospect for both parents ( in UK for example mother can go back straight to work after birth, mandatory 2 weeks if working in production or industrial roles, but leave, including for fathers is not mandatory). If you have 5 children, it is (would be) suddenly nearly 2 years of work for father, I do guess not many companies will decide to keep workers constantly off/on.

It's because big dicks where seen as a barbarian traits, somewhat closer to nature, more animalistic. Big dick was an insult. Today we have both , it's not great to have a baby dick but saying black people have a big dick is one of the ""false positives "" traits. Those primitive people with big dicks , that are excellent at sport and have great rythm but can't build a sustainable civilization , if you will. That may sound like a compliment at first but it really isn't. On the other hand of the spectrum you have the ""cultured"" people. Those who are elaborate but the trade off would be their virility. Sure, they cook great and have great art vite surely they can't possibly have a big dick , right ?  So of anything point at the fact that their dick might be bigger, it has to do with the primitive savages they let in (probably to fertilise the women they can't satisfy themselves) Now let's talk about the elephant('s dick) in the room. Do black people have a bigger dick ? It's hard to tell but it seems that now, not really. Evolution might have favored that trait in some specific ethnies but definitely not across the while continent and the variation is really to small to matter. What transpires is that really, homo sapiens seems to have pretty much always the same average dick size with some people in both extremes. Things like skin color, eye color, speed, lactose tolerance, will give you an evolutionary edge based on your environment. Dick size hardly so, there is an evolutionary ""good enough"" .

&gt;Among the noted critics of Suvorov's work are Israeli historian Gabriel Gorodetsky, American military historian David Glantz,[13] and Russian military historians Makhmut Gareev, Lev Bezymensky, and perhaps his most vehement Russian critic, Alexei Isayev,[14] the author of Anti-Suvorov. According to Glantz, while most agree that Stalin made extensive preparations for an eventual war and that he exploited the military conflict in Europe to his advantage, the assertions that Stalin planned to attack Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941, and that Operation Barbarossa was a preemptive strike by Hitler, are generally discounted.[15] Many other western scholars, such as Teddy J. Uldricks,[6] Derek Watson,[16] Hugh Ragsdale,[17] Roger Reese,[18][19] Stephen Blank,[20] Robin Edmonds,[21] agree that the major part of Suvorov's writings rest on circumstantial evidence,[22] or even on ""virtually no evidentiary base"".[6][23] Jonathan Haslam[24] ""would be comical were it not taken so seriously"".[25] and Alexander Nekrich also disagreed with Suvorov.[26]

Your noble stand isn't for Science, it's for dogma or consensus. You must learn what it means to manufacture consensus. Places like this are used to shape the perspective of citizens at large. The advertisement strategies once employed by those privy few, who understood well enough the human brain and the ways in which it learns have *not* confined themselves to dark corners of the internet. Instead, it's exactly the opposite. You *do not* attack low populated areas in digital warfare (chat rooms and forums), instead, you battle the consensus of public perception to have the most effect.

5015,"&gt; Well, Prussian values are pretty good when it comes to building an army, discipline, loyalty to the government (By now the GG), endurance and independent thinking are generally great things to have.

True. Independent thought is not a prussian virtue, though ;-)


&gt; The thing about similarities with the Wehrmacht is a bit meh in my book, as we still haven't found a good way to reclaim misused symbols, while also prematurely discarding symbols which were far more than just those of the Nazis.

I'm talking about Stahlhelme and MP38/40s as decorations, naming things for Nazi generals etc.

And using Wehrmacht slogans.

THat needs to start waaaay before we get to explicit stuff like swastikas, black suns etc.a

&gt;, seeing that I didn't find many like me during my time in the army.

That's my point, I'm pretty similar, probably older, though.


&gt; A small addendum, pacifists can be good soldiers, and perhaps are even the best for military command roles, as they properly understand the role of the military as both a deterrent and the last resort when all other tools of statecraft have failed.

That is not pacifict, but i get your point. I'd readily fight to protect Germany and the GG.


&gt; The solution is oversight. Which appears to happen now, at long last.
&gt; 
&gt; Oversight is only ever a bandaid. Outside observers can do wonders when used in short bursts, but to ensure a permanent improvement we have to change the culture of the army, so it comes closer to the citizen in uniform we set out to create after the lessons of WW2.


I completely agree on the need to change the cuture and that needs to come from the inside.

We do still need oversight, otherwise the army will inspect itself and find everything OK. 

""Good apples"" need some authority to protect them, otherwise the bad apples will push them out.

For examples, see the police, where people that do not join in makign racist jokes get pushed out of units in Germany...


&gt; I agree, there are plenty of problems inside the Bundeswehr, and to be frank I'm appalled at how much these people have been able to get away with. Scandals like the KSK show us time and time again, that we perhaps need to fundamentally rethink what we want our army to be, and how we intend to achieve that.

YES!

That is my point though. The hardcore right wingers get away with that because they know they do a lot of the stuff they do within the culture of the BW.

* Including newer battles.

* Including battles in the English-speaking world.

* Including conflicts about which the entities involved were able and willing to construct a full historical record.

Like, I don't know much about the Russian Civil War.  But WP has [59 entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Battles_of_the_Russian_Civil_War).  It has eight entries for ""Battles of the Russian Civil War involving the United Kingdom"" and nine for ""Battles of the Russian Civil War involving the United States"".  The US had a fairly minor and peripheral involvement in the Russian Civil War, but has 15% of the entries?  I'm guessing that the people doing English-language WP had access to better UA military sources on actions involving the US than they did conflicts between the many partisan groups involved.

Or to put it another way, WP lists the war as having about 1.5 million Red and about 1.5 million White casualties.  That's of 59 recorded battles.

The American Civil War has about 800k casualties on each side.  It has 222 entries just in the ""Battles of the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War"" category, much less the whole war.

5037,"As far as stats go, I think this should at least represent some frame of refrence, for example what timeline is in question and comparison to all battles fought by the country.

What I'm really getting at here is, that it's a little meaningless to glorify ""winning"" - which I feel is implied - battles out of context.

There's much more to the formation of these countries and their cultures like for example that the boundaries and identities weren't always like they are now. There's also more to the battles than just winning or losing. For example Turkey is a 100 years old country, but founded on roots that in some regards once ruled over half of spain. Many of the countries have had different borders and even somewhat different national identities at some point.

What irked me more than those inconsistencies though, is how do you validate a battle won? Sure there's probably some way of quantifying them in a binary manner, but is there some inherent goodness in either result?

5088,"If you know Spanish, you know in Spain it's called ""indulto"", not ""pardon"", and it does not imply what English does. And Pablo Iglesias, NOT being a judge but a politician CANNOT do what judges do, which is apply the law, whether it's fair or unfair. Politicians cannot declare people guilty or innocent, the judges do that. And the judges must apply the law, they cannot ignore it or pull it out of their asses.  


According to the laws, those people are guilty of going against a few of them, since the fucking Franco-inherited Constitution says on its fucking first article that ""the Constitution is based on the unity of Spain"". So OF COURSE there is NOTHING the left wing parties can do save for an ""indulto"" or ""pardon"", and it doesn't imply shit as you suggest. It means that the law is obsolete, but is goddamned hard to change.  


There are unfair laws in Spain, like the one who protects ""religious feelings"" (it is *de facto* an anti-blasphemy law and should disappear), and the Constitution which demands unity, whether voluntary or involuntary. Politicians who inherited that Constitution and those laws cannot change them without a majority in the Parliament, and as long as those laws exist, if you break them, you are guilty of breaking them.  


Then again, the smartasses at Covergencia i Unió have been holding the Madrid government by the balls since Felipe González lost his first absolute majority. They've had DECADES to demand a change of that Constitution in the Parliament, but they were too busy demanding more money and infrastructure in the budgets. So they used the Parliament whenever it suited them, but never to change the Constitution so they could have a legal, binding referendum. Which is why the European Union and the United Nations gave the message that if you live in a democracy, you cannot get the out just because your balls feel itchy: you should use the available legal procedures. Which they didn't. Which is illegal. Because you CAN have a binding referendum in Spain. Just change the Constitution. It could have been done by those pro-independence parties many times since the 90s. 30 years went by and they did not bother to demand those legal changes in the Madrid Parliament, while being there as involved as they could and holding as much power as they could.   


Do I think suing those hypocrites was a mistake? Very much, it was, again, Rajoy feeding the hate of the PP-loving idiots. Did the hypocrites in jail break the law? Yes, they did, they knew they were doing so, and what pisses me off the most, they NEVER even bothered to try to ask for a Constitutional reform that would get them a binding, legal referendum. They like Spanish laws to get power, but won't bother to do a simple right thing like make a proposal to amend the Constitution. And yes, maybe the Popular Party would veto it (hardly, since CiU has held the key to the national government more than one)... but if they had tried and the PP had vetoed it, they would have an excuse. *They didn't even try.* Ever. Not. Once.  


So, Iglesias is implying nothing. Iglesias is offering to do the only thing a government can do, since so far, there's at least a bit of separation between the Judiciary and the Legislative powers in Spain (thankfully). And the left-wing parties know that keeping those dolts in jail is not beneficial for anybody.  


If it were me, I'd cut Catalonia with a knife, without a referendum. It is just not worth to have a good bunch of the country hating the country itself, its culture, its institutions, and undermining all of those. Since the UN does not allow that either, it must be a legal referendum. Which requires a Constitution reform. Which requires CiU and the Basque parties demanding it...

By the way the Canada FTA is still in force despite a member state's parliament vetoing it. The EU do not give a single fuck. They march on and in future they just won't ask national parliaments (evidenced by the brexit deal).

Second, it is not yet known if those side-effects are actually long term or just lingering for a few weeks-months after the infection (which is to be expected, as it's only been about a year since the virus' discovery). The default assumption is that it behaves like most other viruses and is generally harmless long term, though I can understand if you are not comfortable with this assumption. And third and most important, you are not practically guaranteed you get nothing with a vaccine. That is why medical associations gave it conditional approval (meaning, the benefits outweigh the risks, not there are no risks, and the manufacturers must submit all future data, as the trials are still ongoing). If it was as thoroughly tested as other vaccines, it would get full approval already. I am in favor of having it available for everyone who wants it, especially those at risk, as I do believe for them the benefits do outweigh any potential risks.

So, why didn't EU demand for a full fledged dispute system if China was so desperate and was offering so many concessions?

5340,"&gt;Those do not thrive in an open / progressive environment.

I'd disagree with that one, networks like this can flourish everywhere, and in my opinion and strongly patriotic conservative is just as great of a danger for these cabals, like a progressive.

&gt;The BW still celebrates ""prussian values"" and BW memorabilia is still eerily close to Wehrmacht stuff.

Well, Prussian values are pretty good when it comes to building an army, discipline, loyalty to the government (By now the GG), endurance and independent thinking are generally great things to have.

The thing about similarities with the Wehrmacht is a bit meh in my book, as we still haven't found a good way to reclaim misused symbols, while also prematurely discarding symbols which were far more than just those of the Nazis. However, there are clear lines in that regard which are sometimes ignored by members of the army (Showing explicit Nazi symbols, among other things), for which the perpetrators must be punished harshly.

&gt;""Linksliberale"" will never be joining the BW in any significant numbers because they tend to be more pacifist (not all of them, but as a general rule) and anti authority.

Here's where I'm at a bit of a crossroad. I'd describe myself as Linksliberal, but I willingly did a year of service and considered becoming an officer of the reserve. Of course, I might be pretty unique in that regard, seeing that I didn't find many like me during my time in the army.

A small addendum, pacifists can be good soldiers, and perhaps are even the best for military command roles, as they properly understand the role of the military as both a deterrent and the last resort when all other tools of statecraft have failed.

&gt;The solution is oversight. Which appears to happen now, at long last.

Oversight is only ever a bandaid. Outside observers can do wonders when used in short bursts, but to ensure a permanent improvement we have to change the culture of the army, so it comes closer to the citizen in uniform we set out to create after the lessons of WW2.

&gt;My BW time is a while back, but i remember the NCOs being pretty obviously right wing and casually racist.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if i see what some army people seem to see as OK to decorate their Stuben with, yeah, i'm not convinced the BW is anywhere near ""clean""

I agree, there are plenty of problems inside the Bundeswehr, and to be frank I'm appalled at how much these people have been able to get away with. Scandals like the KSK show us time and time again, that we perhaps need to fundamentally rethink what we want our army to be, and how we intend to achieve that.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/kl0epv/president_of_the_european_commission_ursula_von/ghcaz75/,Johnny917,1609201214

5355,"A regulated market does not mean it is not free. Regulation in general exists to remove market failures such as imperfect information and negative externalities.  Additional regulations in general increase the price of food, as it removes the ability for companies to cut corners and reduce production costs, so higher regulation should increase prices. 

It is also a free market at the point of delivery to the consumer, Tesco, Waitrose, Aldi and Whole Foods can and do charge very different prices to their customers - often for exactly the same product. 

This is also 2019 data, and the GBP was not doing brilliantly over the last few years so not sure what you mean by our currency being strong. If you mean it's worth more than 1 EUR, well that's meaningless. 

We do have a lot of extra money, but not in comparison to Luxembourg, Germany, Austria etc. who are all higher than us in GDP per capita. 

We also have a higher % of our population who are obese than all these other countries, which would be potentially indicative of the fact that we eat lower quality food. 

We also have high consumer prices as shown here [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Comparative\_price\_levels\_of\_consumer\_goods\_and\_services](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Comparative_price_levels_of_consumer_goods_and_services)

&amp;#x200B;

So essentially, no regulations don't decrease prices. Yes, food is a free market at point of delivery to consumer.  The currency isn't strong right now (I think it's going to get stronger moving forward), we don't have more free money than our GDP per capita peers. In general prices are high here for consumer goods, we also are quite an obese population (which the government is trying to do something about which is good!).

5389,"You raise some good points, but I believe you are confusing a lot of things here and I don't have the time to go into a huge amount of detail.

One easy one is that you are confusing GDP and the actual wealth and income of people. They are not as corrolated as you might believe. Take a look at Ireland as an example, its gdp increased by 26% in a single year due to the relocation of certain large coporations. 

Secondly the currency, the pound has depreciated since 2016 due to the Brexit uncertainty but it is still an exceptionally strong currency. This is evident in the UK governments gilt yields.

The food and drink market is not really a free market. You are missing the fact that the production is incredibly subsidised. So yes the UK government is not setting price caps or anything like that. But they are giving taxpayers money to say dairy farmers, which then allows them to sell it cheaper which then allows us to buy it cheaper. It is not the visable subsidy but it is there and it keeps food exceptionally cheap.

5396,"&gt;So, why didn't EU demand for a full fledged dispute system if China was so desperate and was offering so many concessions?

Because of the sentence before, that says “Beijing has balked at EU demands for a binding investor court system to settle disputes”? Just because China offers concessions doesn’t mean it will agree to anything..

&gt;The opposition members threatened to quit. China's government didn't removed them.

More quit out of solidarity with the ones China removed, but China removed 4 in the first place.

&gt;So, Visa and other credit care have been operating in China for more than decade on 2010.

You’re right, I simplified the situation. Visa was allowed in China beforehand, but only for foreign currency transactions. Which is a tiny share of the market and blatantly against the commitments China made a decade earlier.

[The WTO’s dispute panel said Beijing had violated WTO rules with what was effectively a UnionPay monopoly — requiring all yuan-denominated payment cards issued in China to work with UnionPay’s network and be accepted by all UnionPay merchants and ATMs. In the meantime, Mastercard, Visa, and Amex could only be used for foreign currency transactions.](https://supchina.com/2020/02/20/prepare-to-be-underwhelmed-mastercard-makes-a-belated-arrival-in-china/)

The historical context is that Bismarck wanted to demonstrate his necessity by splitting up the governing political block by being even harsher against socialism and alienating the liberal parties. Such a situation was supposed to convince Wilhelm he's an absolute necessity. Wilhelm wanted to actively rule himself though and viewed Bismarck as an antiquated man from the past and they immediately clashed over this law. Bismarck dug in his heels, Wilhelm didn't budge, and ultimately, issued his resignation to solve the dispute. 

So the idea of this pro-Bismarck cartoon is that the child on the throne is playing with a powder keg he doesn't understand. And he's sitting on a pile of weapons because anti-Bismarck sentiment was that he's become too conservative in his approach to war and doesn't risk anything to gain high rewards, something which Wilhelm wanted to ""fix"".

We all know it's difficult to prove the perpetrator of a crime when he/she is denying it and in a good position to lie. Therefore we need to look at the general state policy to **deduct** with accuracy that it is what it is. 

You can google plentiful of information about the connections of the Turkish administration, functionaries and politics with the [""angry Muslims"" as the Minister of foreign affairs called ISIS](https://www.oneyoungworld.com/blog/turkey-biggest-refugee-country). The AKP, and especially Erdogan are using religion as a means to claim influence all over countries that share the religion in majority. They refused for a very long time to call ISIS a terrorist organisation (which it is by all definitions). There are tons of reports showing that the Turkish state [housed ISIS members in the heat of war and treated them in hospitals](https://www.france24.com/en/20140617-hurriyet-turkey-government-protecting-isis-militants-photo).
Journalists that uncovered these links [were persecuted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/27/turkish-journalists-charged-over-claim-that-secret-services-armed-syrian-rebels). Other reports tell that the [ISIS fiscal manager lived freely in Istanbul](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/mena/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-s-brother-travelled-in-and-out-of-istanbul-as-his-courier-for-months-1.933814). 
These are dead giveaways of Turkish state usage of ISIS for goals. There are more of course. The only requirement is to be able to separate oneself from the identity of the state. Else people cannot think critical. I have added here only some links about TRstate-ISIS ties. It should work as an incentive to check out the background of Erdogan, the synthesis of Turk-Islam and the so called ""deep state"".

Probably depends on the country. I'm from Germany and there's very little exceptions (in every federal state) that allow for homeschooling (like children raised in a circus for example). And if you do, you have to cover all the subjects that the states curriculum dictates and need to be a regularly qualified teacher.

5683,"An army of more than ten thousand medics and volunteers has been recruited by the NHS to help deliver the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, once it is given approval.
The Telegraph has learned that teams are trained and ready to begin giving the jab at sports stadia and race courses across the country, with a target of vaccinating at least a million people each week.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab could be approved early next week by the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), after the final cut of data was submitted by the Government last Monday.

Officials have pinpointed January 4, 2021 as the date the rollout of the mass vaccination programme will begin.

A Government source said: “At the moment, we are operationalising everything for the 4 January for the first Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs in arms. You’ll see it everywhere, while we’ll also be carrying on with Pfizer.”
The source added: “Tens of thousands of vaccinators and support staff have been recruited.”

They are expected to be delivering at least a million jabs a week to the vulnerable by the middle of next month, once manufacturing has been scaled up.
Village halls, community centres and other local sites overseen by GPs will be used to administer the vaccine alongside vast regional hubs.

How does the Oxford vaccine work? The Telegraph can also reveal that ministers are looking at proposals to triple the length of the time between taking a first and second dose of a vaccine in order to speed up the delivery of the vaccine before Easter.

It comes as frontline NHS workers have been told they will soon receive the Oxford vaccine, and amid calls for teachers to be prioritised alongside health workers for the jab to help keep schools open.

The head of AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot, has also revealed the company has come up with a ""winning formula"" which has boosted the effectiveness of the jab so that it matches the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
Britain has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford jab, with 40 million expected to be available by the end of March. Manufacturing is due to scale up significantly from the second half of January.

The ease of delivering the vaccine, compared with the complicated cold chain required for the Pfizer jab, and low cost mean its approval is viewed as a game-changing development in Westminster.
Tale of the tape: Pfizer/BioNTech v AstraZeneca/Oxford v Moderna The rollout of the Oxford jab is a core element of the Government’s exit strategy from tough lockdown measures, as concerns grow over the damage to the economy wrought by keeping whole sectors shut.

Ministers are aiming for all vulnerable Britons included in its priority list of nine vulnerable groups, which cover around a quarter of the population, to receive a first dose of the jab by the end of February, and a second dose by the end of March.

Once this feat is achieved, mortality from the illness will be reduced by up to 99 per cent.
It is hoped the tougher lockdown restrictions can be lifted at that point.

At present, 43 per cent of the population is living under Tier 4 restrictions, which require Britons to stay at home and the hospitality industry and non-essential retail to close, after emergency measures were implemented on Boxing Day ahead of the fortnightly review scheduled for December 30.

Ministers will still meet on Wednesday to review the latest data, with a series of other areas set to be plunged into Tier 4. Burnley, Cumbria and Lincoln are thought to be at risk of moving into the toughest tier.
Last night senior doctors warned the NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, as the number of coronavirus patients in hospital is about to exceed the peak of the first wave.

Former Tory party leader Lord Hague of Richmond last week warned the Prime Minister to undertake “a national mobilisation of resources on a scale never before seen outside of war” to accelerate the vaccine rollout in the face of the new hyper-infectious mutant strain of Covid-19.

Government insiders have credited Minister for the Vaccine Rollout, Nadhim Zahawi, UK vaccine taskforce chief Kate Bingham, and St John Ambulance, for scaling up infrastructure and personnel ready for the rollout next month.

A high proportion have been recruited by St John Ambulance, which reached out to its network of 25,000 volunteers, while also partnering with the Royal Voluntary Service, British Red Cross and other charities.
Ministers have a target of enlisting 10,000 vaccinators, 14,350 care volunteers to observe people after they have received the jab, and 6,150 patient advocates to welcome and process people arriving at centres.
Retired doctors and nurses, pharmacists and trained first aiders have been drafted in to administer jabs, while other members of the public have signed up as support staff.

A Government source also revealed that ministers are looking at proposals to triple the length of the delay between taking a first and second dose of a vaccine in order to give millions more a single dose more quickly, while waiting for more deliveries of doses.

Proposals to offer Britons only a single dose have been shelved, but ministers are examining the idea of extending the time between doses from between three and four weeks to around 12 weeks.
A Government source said: ""Everyone will get two doses, nobody will only get a half dose, but it could be a longer period, up to 12 weeks, between jabs. You could get a better impact.

""The MHRA will look at this stuff and decide what’s the best thing to do to get the most effective vaccination programme in the fastest, safest way possible.""
Pfizer vaccine rollout perfect scenario However, the insider added that a longer delay between doses would become redundant once sufficient quantities of the jab became available, saying: ""We're getting the volume coming now with Oxford/AstraZeneca, so it could become academic.""

The Pfizer results were based on a regime of two doses 21 days apart, while the Oxford vaccine was given 28 days apart.

The MHRA determines the dosing regime based on submitted evidence, so moving to a single dose, or a delayed second dose regime, would be experimental and could leave the government liable to legal action.
While those waiting longer for a jab would not be disadvantaged in the long term, they would be more at risk in the delay period before the second injection.
However, the Government could decide to initiate a clinical trial within the general rollout and monitor the efficacy of a delayed second jab among consenting participants.

Previous studies of vaccines have shown that delaying a second dose does not usually result in reduced long-term efficacy.",,/r/europe/comments/klvnuw/oxford_coronavirus_vaccine_10000_medics_and/ghb5645/,Specific_Bowler,1609179398

You mean less than 2 years. 

&gt; Het aanleggen van de grote polders was een ingewikkelde klus. Daarom wilden de ingenieurs eerst ‘oefenen’ met een klein stukje Zuiderzee bij Andijk. Het project begon in 1926 en al op 27 augustus 1927 viel de proefpolder van veertig hectare droog. Totale kosten: ongeveer een miljoen gulden. In een speciaal gebouwde boerderij en een laboratorium bekeken onderzoekers hoe ze de zoute grond geschikt konden maken voor landbouw. Ook wilden zij meer weten over de ontzilting, inklinking en opdroging van de bodem.

&gt; Al in 1929 was de bodem van de polder zodanig verbeterd dat landbouw mogelijk was. [1](https://www.westfriesarchief.nl/historie/thema-s/land-en-water/proefpolder-andijk)

So 27 august 1927 the test polder of Andijk was dry, in 1929 it was suitable for agriculture.",Koninkrijk der Nederlanden,/r/europe/comments/klnx5n/estonia_13_million_is_21_bigger_the_netherlands/ghaq7p3/,GloinGleckal,1609171688

5778,"Covid, 'Italian variant' discovered: circulating since August

Published on: 28/12/2020 16:58

by Paola Olgiati

""Circulating since early August in Italy is a variant"" of Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus ""very similar to the infamous English variant."" An ""Italian variant"" discovered in Brescia, ""which precedes the variant that emerged only at the end of September in the United Kingdom and then spread to Europe, including Italy, and could also be a precursor"". This was announced to Adnkronos Health by Arnaldo Caruso, president of the Italian Society of Virology (Siv-Isv), professor of Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology at the University of Brescia, director of the Laboratory of Microbiology of Asst Spedali Civili.

The variant identified, he explains, ""has several points of mutation in the Spike protein, the 'hook' that the virus uses to attack the receptor present on the target cells in our body. Like the English one, also the Italian variant has a mutation in a crucial point of the Spike/cellular receptor interaction, more precisely in position 501"". But unlike the Gb mutant, ""the Italian variant also has a second mutation at position 493, which makes its Spike protein slightly different from that of the pandemic virus we all know today.""

But how did they come to describe the Italian variant? ""By chance - Caruso says - observing an abnormal viral persistence in a patient who had suffered from Covid-19 in April. Even after the recovery, the swabs carried out from August onwards had always given positive results with highly charged virus. In November we decided to sequence the virus to understand the reason for this persistence, and to our surprise we realized that we had identified a new variant, similar but not identical to the English variant that was beginning to circulate in Italy. At this point we also sequenced a sample of the same patient obtained in August"", discovering that ""the variant Spike was already present then, with all its mutations"".

""We do not know if the English variant emerged exactly at the end of September, as well as ours in early August - specifies the number one of virologists - A temporal analysis of the sequences of Sars-CoV-2, carried out by the group of Massimo Ciccozzi"", epidemiologist at the University Campus BioMedico in Rome, ""tells us that this new Italian variant could have been generated around early July. What we can say from the studies of our colleague Ciccozzi is that ours is certainly the first evidence of mutations in the Spike protein at position 501 in Italy and perhaps, at least to date, in Europe. The sequence homology between the variant identified by us and the English one leads to think that the first one may have actually generated the others that today are emerging in our continent. But to affirm this it is necessary to reconstruct the steps, and many analyses of the viral genome are still not available"".

But is there any fear that the anti-Covid vaccine may not work on the Italian variant? ""Theoretically, no - Caruso replies - The vaccine generates a complex response to many areas of the Spike protein,"" so, ""even if there were some antibodies not able to recognize a mutated area such as the one in position 501 or 493, there would certainly be others able to bind to non-mutated portions of the protein. Their binding would be sufficient to prevent the interaction between Spike and the cell receptor, if only for a sort of 'steric clutter' that the antibodies would create on the surface of the virus. In a short time, however, we will have a definite answer to this question.""

""The high viral load present in the August and November swabs"" performed on the patient who did not become negative ""allowed us to isolate viral mutants in Brescia. This - says Caruso - will allow us to test these viruses with the sera of Covid-19 patients obtained during the first pandemic wave, and to evaluate the ability of antibodies to neutralize this variant compared to previously circulating viral strains. As soon as available, sera from vaccinated patients will be similarly evaluated. I remain optimistic at the moment,"" concludes the president of the Italian virologists.

5798,"Citing yourself as a source doesn't make it true. If you can't prove it with some data it can't be taken as a fact that there's another 15% of Greeks that have partial ancestry from the islands. The same goes for the blondeness. 

If I were to claim that 10% of Greeks are of Polish ancestry, another 20% of Italian ancestry, 30% Celtic ancestry, 30% Turkish ancestry and 10% Egyptian ancestry, you wouldn't believe me and you would be right not to.

I brought Bulgaria as an example. Check out Serbia's, Albania's, Romania's or whatever Balkan country's cuisine you like. They all share similar dishes. The point is not to be identical. Of course there are variations from county to country. The fact that they have the same cultural origin is enough proof that they are culturally connected. It's not about who invented them but about the fact that we share them. Even Crete which has both Venetian and Ottoman heritage has raki (tsikoudia) as its trademark beverage.

They have them but it's not the norm like it is here and their group dances are very different from ours. Sardana is in a group but not like how our groups dance. Tarantella is somewhat similar to one dance I've seen in a folk festival in Corfu when I was on vacations there, but I have no idea what it was called. The ionians have more similarities with Italy because of Venice yet the rest of their dances and the ones people actually danced (the one similar to sardana I saw was presented by a group of dancers in costumes without regular people participating) were the ones we dance in the rest of Greece or very similar to them. Wikipedia is claiming we have 10,000 dances but there is no source to check the claim, so I don't really believe that unless I can check it.

Again, I'm bringing Bulgaria as an example but as you can see here [our instruments and type of music is similar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Bulgaria#Folk_music). Bouzouki is an anatolian instrument that came to Greece a century ago and there is a bulgarian counterpart and there is one for toumberleki too. There are similar instruments in Serbia too. Our polyphonic singing is similar too. I just pick one county as an example because the Balkans have a lot of countries and it would take forever to mention the similarities between all of us.

Yes, but the Orthodox do it in red while the other countries do it differently. It shows that even though Europe is predominantly Christian and there's a lot of things we all share, our cultural subgroup has differences. It shows that even though we share things with other countries, we share more with the Balkans.

Well you didn't make it clear you were talking about the broader region. Should have cleared it up since they share a name.

Good for you for not supporting the neo-nazis anymore. I'm very much aware of 19th century nationalism. I'd argue though that it's better to follow the nationalism of your own century because it has evolved a lot since then and the older versions have now become irrelevant. I mean even in your case, you don't really believe in 19th century nationalism. That version was irredentist and was all for maximizing its territory and dominance and you say you are against it. What you're describing is what Greek nationalism adopted after 1922.

Anyway, your opinion is your opinion. I would only like to remind you because it's relevant to the topic of this discussion of a very famous and influential liberal nationalist and Greek hero, ~~Albertos Einsteinios~~  Rigas Feraios, who wanted all of the Christian people of the Ottoman empire to revolt and create a pan-balkan federation.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/kl44n0/the_president_of_greece_katerina_sakellaropoulou/ghargem/,merkoyris,1609172367

5830,"Bismarck resigned in 1890s. During the 19th century, workers started to organise themselves to fight for better living and working conditions, as well as social programs. This happened under the banner of socialism.

Remember, during the last 18th and 19th centuries, the industrialisation in the capitalist societies went totally unchecked, political representation of the people was much smaller and the political power of their representatives much weaker. (especially true in germany, where parliaments where mostly for show). The results where 10-16 hour standart workdays, child labour, almost no social security etc. 

The socialist movements wanted to change the inhumane conditions under which large parts of the working society lived and that in of itself brought them the animosity of the industrial elite, which was of course intertwined with the political elite. The socialist movements where heterogenous but for the most part influenced by a simplified version of Marxist theory, which made not only the industirial but also the aristorcatic leaders absolutly hostile to their cause. 

(This trend only accelerated over the next decades, especially after the bolshevik revolution in russia)

As a reactionary aristocrat with the typical 19th century militaristic mindset, Bismarck was deeply allergic to everything which looked remotely socialistic, and he essentially wanted to agressively supress the social democrats. Bismarck himself did some social programs (like the invalidenrente, basically pensions for crippeled war veterans) but his position was to only give so much ground as is absolutly necessary to prevent people from doing the french-revolution-guilliotine-thing to the elite.

Kaiser Wilhelm on the other hand was not a progressive person, but he did not want his reign to start with the bloodshed necessary to keep the people in line. So he promised some social reform. This caused Bismarck and Wilhelm to depart in bitter disagreement. 

Little fun fact to discuss: Many of the social goods which where won by the workers movements during that time are still the standart today. Like the 40 hour workday. 40 hours of work was considered enough in a time where overall productivity was much lower, only the men worked, and wives where house slaves which did all the childcare, cooking and cleaning before you get home.",,/r/europe/comments/kln1wi/political_cartoon_about_bismarcks_resignation/ghaexkx/,J_P_Amboss,1609164694

You're most likely a smart man that realises jokes or loonery online does not represent the general populace - why even attempt to present such? I could raid posts hitting r/all giving anecdotal evidence that would make Finnish speakers seem like xenophobical supremacists, but that is not the reality as 99% of people are completely normal, hard-working and kind-hearted people. Nobody is coming after the Finnish language, the Swedish language in Finland is a dying breed as Fenno-Swedish municipalities turn Finnish and Fenno-Swedish youth bleed to Sweden. Neither is anyone seeing Finnish speakers as a lower class, aside of perhaps some single twat somewhere. To even present such falls in line with the classic tactics of the (global) right wing - pick from Twitter some single idiot there is only a handful globally, then make a ten minute video screaming about how all feminists/leftists/atheists/minorities are bad.

5871,"I think what we disagree is whether having a nation state or some concept of a national means the people had a national identify. This is not just a matter of Norway. At that time people in Europe did not identify as part of some nation or national state. It may seem weird now since it is so rooted in it. 

That also means when you say Norway was under danish control it is difficult to follow. Who were the Danish? It is not like they had voted the king in or has any say. The noble had a say. But when it came to rights and obligations whether you lived in Bergen or in Aalborg made no difference.

I never said Norway never existed. That would be absurd. Just like the island of Bornholm existed or Jutland existed. What I say is that national identify was simply not a thing back then.

Which also means separating Norway and Denmark when it comes to responsibly for the colonies makes little sense to me. The advantages and wealth went just as much to Bergen as to Aalborg. Most probably went to Copenhagen. But it is not like those which ancestors lived in today’s Denmark had any say - no more than those living in today’s Norway. If Norwegian children are not taught about this - and Norway is portrayed as having no role in that I think it is misleading.
